The plaintiff is represented by both public and private counsel. The plaintiff asked the court for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages. The plaintiff asked the court to permanently enjoin the defendants from: imposing the sex-offender label on him without a hearing that met due process requirements; subjecting the plaintiff to conditions that were different than similar supervisees; and failing to accommodate his religious exercise. The plaintiff also alleged that he has not had the same opportunities as other supervisees to acquire a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive education. </p><p>On June 25 2007, Judge Lee Yeakel dismissed the plaintiff's claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. The plaintiff's claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 were allowed to proceed. The decision allowing the claims to proceed under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 was appealed. On June 23, 2008, the US Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, affirmed the decision of the district court.</p><p>On March 24, 2009, Judge Lee Yeakel ordered that the defendants must afford the plaintiff due process of law, and dismissed, without prejudice, all of his other claims. This judgment was appealed. </p><p>On May 20, 2010, The United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, ruled mostly for the plaintiff, slightly modifying the amount of due process that the plaintiff must be afforded. </p><p>On March 30, 2011, the district court (Judge Lee Yeakel) granted the plaintiff's motion for the enforcement of the March 24, 2009 judgment as confirmed by the court of appeals, and ordered that the determination of whether the plaintiff should be considered a sex offender should conform with the plaintiff's due process rights.  On August 24, 2011, the district court (Judge Lee Yeakel) denied the plaintiff's second motion for enforcement of the judgment, ruling that the defendant's actions after the March 30, 2011 order had sufficiently complied with the March 24, 2009 judgment.</p><p>The plaintiff's original sentence for murder ended in 2012.

It appears that the plaintiff settled with the Texas Department of Pardons and Parole.</p><p>On December 12, 2013, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as moot since they did not have the ability to grant the relief that the plaintiff was asking for. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice stated that only the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole had this power, and they had been dismissed from the complaint.</p><p>On March 13, 2014, the plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint based on the defendant's motion to dismiss for mootness. On July 29, 2014, the plaintiff filed a sixth amended complaint alleging that the plaintiff was unable to move into suitable housing and denied employment due to the defendant's actions.

Raul Meza is a mandatory supervision parolee. \n2.  The Texas Department of Criminal Justice Parole Division (โthe Departmentโ) treats \nMr. Meza significantly differently than other mandatory supervision parolees who are similarly \nsituated โ people with similar convictions, backgrounds, and parole conditions.   \n3.  The  Departmentโs  special  attention  dramatically  interferes  with  Mr.  Mezaโs \nopportunity to readjust to society. For years, the Department has exercised its discretionary \nauthority to isolate him from his family, deny him employment, and otherwise punished him.  \n4.  The Department has no reason to treat Mr. Meza differently than other similarly-\nsituated parolees, and yet it does. This special attention violates his 14th Amendment right to \nequal protection. \n5.  The Department will continue this course as long as Mr. Meza is on mandatory \nsupervision if there is no judicial intervention to stop it.  Therefore, Mr. Meza seeks declaratory \nrelief, injunctive relief, attorneysโ fees and costs. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 2 of 10\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343. \n7.  Further, Defendantsโ actions and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Travis \nCounty, Texas, and TDCJ maintains headquarters in Austin. TEX. GOVโT CODE 492.014 (b). \nAccordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391, venue is proper for this Court. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff, Raul Meza, and resides in Travis County on mandatory supervision parole. \n9.  Defendant  Brad  Livingston  is  the  executive  director  of  the  Texas  Department  of \nCriminal Justice (โTDCJโ).  \n10.  Defendant Stuart Jenkins is the director of the TDCJ Parole Division. \n11.  In all the actions described herein, Defendant Jenkins and Livingston are acting under \ncolor of law and pursuant to legal authority. They are sued only in their official capacities for \ninjunctive and declaratory relief.1 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Mr. Meza is on mandatory supervision for a possessing a weapon in prison in 1989. \n12.  Mr.  Meza  was  sentenced  to  thirty  years  in  state  prison  on  March  8,  1982.  That \nsentence ended in 2012. \n13.  On September 8, 1989, he was also sentenced to four additional years imprisonment, \nto be served consecutively with his original term, for possession of a deadly weapon in a penal \ninstitution. That is the conviction for which he is currently on mandatory supervision. \n14.  The  purpose  of  mandatory  supervision  is  rehabilitation.  TEX.  CRIM.  PRO.  ART. \n42.18(2)(b) (1987). It was meant โto aid all prisoners to readjust to society upon completion of \ntheir period of incarceration.โ TEX. CRIM. PRO. ART. 42.18(1) (1987).  \n                                                 \n1 Because Defendants Livingston and Jenkins are sued in their official capacities, this complaint will refer to them \nsimply as โthe Division.โ \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 3 of 10\n15.  Mr. Meza was downgraded from โsuper intensiveโ supervision to โmoderate securityโ \nsupervision in 2010, and his therapist reports Mr. Meza has made remarkable progress in his \ntreatment. In September 2013, his therapist recommended he be allowed to graduate and leave \ntreatment, noting Mr. Meza: \n๏ท  Completed 318 sessions, with components on empathy, thinking errors and social \nskills;  \n๏ท  Has shown significant emotional improvement; \n๏ท  โHe continues to be a significant leader in group, freely and opening discussing his \noffense, taking full responsibility for his behaviorโ \n๏ท  โHe identifies errors in othersโ thinking accuratelyโ \n๏ท  โHis performance has been consistent, he has passed his Polygraphs, and is doing \nwell in [treatment]โ \n๏ท  โThe reduction in his Supervision level is to be in everyoneโs favor.โ \nB.  The Department singles-out Mr. Meza for especially onerous treatment for no reason. \n16.  A  state  violates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  when  it  intentionally  treats  a  person \ndifferently  from  others  who  are  similarly  situated  without  a  rational  justification.  Newman \nMarchive Partnership, Inc. v. Hightower, 349 Fed.Appx. 963, 965 (5th Cir. 2009). It doesnโt \nmatter if the treatment itself โ when viewed in isolation โ is reasonable. The choice to treat a \nperson differently than his peers must also be rational. Id. (citing City of Cleburne, Tex. v. \nCleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 440-42 (1985)) (emphasis added). \n17.  There  are  many  mandatory  supervision  parolees  similarly  situated  to  Mr.  Meza. \nNeither of his convictions are unique, nor were the circumstances of the crimes. There are other \npeople are mandatory supervision today with the same convictions and background as Mr. Meza. \nThere are other parolees with the same conditions of parole. \n18.  Yet, the Department treats Mr. Meza significantly differently than parolees with whom \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 4 of 10\nhe is similarly situated.  \n19.  โMr. Meza is specifically limiting his challenge to the actions TDCJ is taking within \nthe scope of its discretion to administer the terms of his parole. His claims do not challenge the \nterms and conditions the Parole Board itself imposed.โ \n20.  Mr. Meza is confined to his home unless the Department allows him to leave. It uses \nthat authority arbitrarily, and has isolated him from family, church, and employment for years. \n21.  The Departmentโs exercise of its discretionary authority severely inhibits Mr. Mezaโs \nability to maintain ties with his family, attend church, and to be employed โ all of which are \npermitted and encouraged by the terms of his parole. \nSeparated from Family \n22.  The Department arbitrarily isolates Mr. Meza from his family. \nMr. Mezaโs stepfather recently died. The Department refused to let Mr. Meza visit his stepfather \nwhile he was on his death bed; so he did not arrive until five hours after his step father had \npassed away. Other, similarly situated parolees would have been allowed to visit a parent in their \nfinal hours.  \n23.  The Department would not allow Mr. Meza to attend his stepfatherโs funeral until after \nhis counsel intervened to plead his case.  \n24.  Mr. Meza fears this will happen again with his mother. The Division has the lawful \nauthority to allow Mr. Meza to visit his mother, but it refuses to exercise it. Other similarly \nsituated parolees would be allowed to visit their aging, infirm mother โ at least to some extent. \nMr. Meza is denied that opportunity because of his history with the Division. \nDenied Church \n25.  The Department refuses to allow Mr. Meza to visit church, unlike other similarly \nsituated parolees. \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 5 of 10\n26.  Recently, Mr. Meza requested permission to visit a church in south Austin. In the past, \nhe has been allowed to visit it a handful of times, on an ad hoc basis. Today, however, the \nDivision has flatly denied him permission to go again, without justification. His parole officer \nsimply told him โ[the request] went up the chain of commandโ and was denied. \n27.  In early 2013, the Department allowed Mr. Meza to attend Sunday services at a Baptist \nChurch  in  north  Austin.  But  after  Mr.  Meza  had  attended  three  services,  the  Department \ninexplicably decided he would no longer be permitted to go. \n28.  One other parolee, in particular, who is registered sex offender, was attending the \nsame church at the same time as Mr. Meza, and on information and belief, the Department \nallowed him to continue attending even after it stopped Mr. Meza. There was no reason to treat \nthem differently. \nHome \n29.  A  few  months  ago,  Mr.  Meza  was  preparing  to  move  to  a  new  home.  It  was \ntransitional housing for parolees, and other parolees with whom he is similarly situated live \nthere. The owner approved Mr. Meza as a tenant. \n30.  Mr. Meza proposed the plan to his parole officer and the officerโs supervisor. They \ntold him the plan was approved, but they needed to โline up a few detailsโ before he could move. \n31.  But the Divisionโs assistant regional director called Mr. Meza at the last minute before \nhe moved, and told him he was actually denying the request. He told Mr. Meza that he had \ndecided to deny it because he considered Mr. Meza an โongoing threat.โ He would not give any \nfurther explanation. \n32.  Mr. Mezaโs only alternative was to move into substandard housing in a rundown \nneighborhood. On information and belief, the Division reversed its decision to approve Mr. \nMezaโs placement at the first home because it was located in a more affluent neighborhood, and \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 6 of 10\nthe Division did not want him to live there. There was no penological justification for the \ndecision. \nDenied Employment \n33.  Every travel request Mr. Meza makes to the Department has to be passed up through \nfour levels in its chain-of-command, including: \n๏ท  His parole officer, Ray Rodriguez; \n๏ท  His parole offerโs supervisor, Kim Solis; \n๏ท  The acting head of the Parole Divisionโs Austin offices; and \n๏ท  Jayme Martinez, Assistant Regional Director. \n34.  Other paroleesโ travel requests are handled by their immediate parole officer, including \nparolees similarly-situated to Mr. Meza. But those paroleesโ travel requests are not reviewed \ndirector level, even though there is no reason to treat them differently than Mr. Meza. \n35.  For over three years, Department routinely refused to approve Mr. Mezaโs requests to \ntravel to job interviews.  Often a week or more would pass before he got any response. Even if \nthe request was ultimately approved, so much time had passed that often the job was no longer \nbe available. The delay was caused by passing all of his requests through hands at so many levels \nin the Divisionโs chain of command, which does not happen to other mandatory supervision \nparolees. There is no reason to treat Mr. Meza differently. \n36.  Mr. Meza must submit all travel plans to the Department for approval two weeks in \nadvance and cannot deviate from them. Other mandatory supervision parolees with the same \nparole conditions have flexibility to change their travel plans by calling their parole officers, \nwhich permits them to take care of daily affairs and build lives in the free world โ which is the \ngoal of mandatory supervision. The Department does not permit Mr. Meza that flexibility. For \ninstance, Mr. Meza was once approved to visit a business in the morning for a job interview, but \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 7 of 10\nthe staff person who was scheduled to interview him was unexpectedly absent. Another staff \nperson asked him to the return in the afternoon, but the Department would not let him return. \nNeedless to say, he was not hired. The Department does not treat similarly situated parolees this \nway, and has no reason to treat Mr. Meza differently. \n37.  Mr. Meza was recently hired at an auto body shop, in February 2014, for the first time \nafter three years of mandatory supervision โ a length of time unique among similarly-situated \nparolees.  The  Department  caused  his  long-term  unemployment.  It  only  stopped  because  of \npressure from this litigation. If he were to lose his current job while this litigation was not \nongoing, the Department would resume its behavior. The Departments treats other mandatory \nsupervision  parolees  differently,  and  does  not  actively  interfere  with  their  efforts  to  have \nemployment. \nCAUSE OF ACTION โEQUAL PROTECTION \n38.  The  Department  intentionally  treats  Mr.  Meza  differently  than  similarly  situated \nmandatory supervision parolees, for no reason rationally related to any legitimate government \ninterest.  \n39.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  Mr.  Mezaโs  parole  are  onerous  but  not  unique.  On \ninformation and belief, the Parole Board has imposed the same set of conditions on other \nparolees. Yet TDCJ treats Mr. Meza differently than other parolees who bear the same terms and \nconditions of parole, for no legitimate or logical reason. \n40.  Objectives  โsuch  as  a  bare  desire  to  harm  a  politically  unpopular  group  are  not \nlegitimate state interests.โ City of Cleburne, Tex., 473 U.S. at 446-47 (citing U. S. Dept. of \nAgriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534-35 (1973)). Nor may the State, even when it cites a \nlegitimate state interest, โrely on a classification whose relationship to [the] asserted goal is so \nattenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.โ Id. \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 500   Filed 07/29/14   Page 8 of 10\n41.  The Department treats Mr. Meza as a โclass of one,โ in violation of his right to equal \nprotection under the law. Newman Marchive Partnership, 349 Fed.Appx. at 965. \n42.  To put it simply, TDCJ treats Mr. Meza differently from other parolees because of \nwho he is (Raul Meza) rather than what he is (the total sum of his parts). It is purposefully \ntreating him differently than similarly situated parolees with the same terms and conditions of \nparole, without a legitimate justification. \n43.  If the relevant penological factors surrounding Mr. Meza (e.g. terms and conditions of \nparole, background, conviction, success during parole) were written on a notecard without his \nname and shuffled with a dozen more note cards describing other anonymous parolees similarly \nsituated to Mr. Meza in each penologically-relevant respect, and if TDCJ then used those note \ncards to determine how they would administer those individualsโ parole, Mr. Meza would not be \ntreated differently than the other parolees in the stack. \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n44.  Mr. Meza seeks a declaratory judgment that Defendants are violating his right to equal \nprotection under the law. 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201. \n45.  Mr. Meza seeks a declaration stating: \na.

By his motion, Collier requests that this \nCourt enter a protective order staying discovery as to Collier until resolution of the qualified-\nimmunity issues, or at least until he has had an opportunity to review PlaintiffMeza's \"fact specific \npleading to determine if [Meza] has stated a claim against him in his personal capacity.\"  Upon \nreview of the motion and the case file, the Court is of the opinion that Collier's motion should be \ndenied. \nDefendant Collier filed his first motion for protective order in this Court on July 28, 2006, \nthis \nrequesting relief that was similar to the relief requested in the motion now pending before  Court. \nCollier's first motion for protective order was referred to Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin for \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 70   Filed 02/06/07   Page 2 of 2\nresolution.  On August 30, 2006, Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin denied Collier's first motion for \nprotective order because Magistrate Judge Austin had rendered a Report and Recommendation \n(Clerk's Document 26) on Collier's Motion to Dismiss, recommending that Collier's motion be \ndenied as to Plaintiff s claims for prospective injunctive relief and that such claims against Collier \nremain pending for trial.  Magistrate Judge Austin advised Collier that, if Judge Yeakel did not \naccept the Report and Recommendation regarding Meza's claims for prospective injunctive relief, \nCollier could then renew his request for a protective order. \nOn December 6,2006, this Court signed an Order accepting the Magistrate Judge's Report \nand Recommendation as to Meza's claim for prospective injunctive relief (Clerk's Document 52). \nFurthermore, this Court ordered Meza to submit a reply to Defendants' Answer that pleads his \nallegations against Collier with specificity.

Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on Plaintiff Raul Meza's religious \nexercise while he has been incarcerated at the Travis County Correctional Complex (TCCC), Del \nValle facility, in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 \n(\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc (2000). \n2.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c.  ยง 1983, Defendants have,  without due process of law, \nimposed conditions upon Plaintiff Meza's incarceration that are qualitatively different from the \npunishment typically imposed on other similarly situated parolees, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n3.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983, Mr.  Meza claims that Defendants violated his \nFourteenth  Amendment  due  process  rights  by  imposing  additional  informal,  unauthorized \n\nโข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 2 of 12\nconditions on his confinement without due process of law. \n4.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Mr. Meza claims that policy and custom of the \nTCCC's Del Valle facility, described herein, resulted in violations of his Fourteenth Amendment \ndue process rights. \n5.  Mr. Meza seeks damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and \ncosts as a result of Defendants' violations. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343. \n7.  Further, Defendants' actions and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Del \nValle, Texas.  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391, venue is proper for this Court. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff is confined at the TCCC facility in Del Valle. \n9.  Defendant Brad Livingston is the executive director of the Texas Department of \nCriminal Justice (\"TDCJ\"). \n10.  Defendant Brian Collier is the director of the TDCJ Parole Division. \n11.  In all the actions described herein, Defendant Collier and Defendant Livingston \n(\"TDCJ Defendants\") each were acting under color of law and pursuant to  legal authority. \nDefendant Collier is sued in his official and individual capacities; Defendant Livingston is sued \nonly in his official capacity. \n12.  At all relevant times, Rissie L. Owens, Jose Aliseda, Charles Aycock, Conrith \nDavis, Jackie DeNoyelles, Linda Garcia, and Juanita M. Gonzales (hereinafter collectively \"the \nBoard\")  were  members  of the  Texas  Board  of Pardons  and  Paroles,  and,  as  such,  were \nresponsible for upholding the laws of the United States and Texas.  At all relevant times, the \n2 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 3 of 12\nBoard acted under color of law.  The Board is sued in their official capacities for injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief. \n13.  Rissie L. Owens can be served at the Austin offices of the Board of Pardons and \nParoles, 209 W. 14th Street, Suite 500, Austin, TX 78701. \n14.

Juanita Gonzales can be served at the Gatesville offices of the Board of Pardons \nand Paroles, 3408 S. State Highway 36, Gatesville, TX 76528. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n20.  On or about March 8, 1982, Plaintiff pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to \nthirty (30) years imprisonment in Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facilities. \n21.  On or about September 8, 1989, Plaintiff was sentenced to four (4) additional years \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively to the thirty (30) year term, for possession of a deadly \nweapon in a penal institution. \n22.  TDCJ released Plaintiff to the custody of Defendant Sheriff of Travis County on or \nabout  September  25,  2002,  on  \"mandatory  supervision.\"  Plaintiffs release  on  mandatory \n3 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 4 of 12\nsupervision was required by statute because his calendar time served plus \"good time\" credits \naccumulated totaled the maximum length of his sentence.  See Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. 42.18(8)(c) \n(1987). \n23.  Mandatory supervision is \"the release of a prisoner from imprisonment, but not on \nparole, and not from the legal custody of the state, for rehabilitation outside prison walls under \nsuch conditions and provisions for disciplinary supervision as the board may determine.\"  Tex. \nCrim. Pro. Art. 42.18(2)(b) (1987).  The purpose of mandatory supervision is \"to aid all prisoners \nto readjust to society upon completion of their period of incarceration.\"  Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. \n42.18(1) (1987). \n24.  Parolees on mandatory supervision at TCCC are allowed to search for a job in the \ncommunity and to leave the facility to work when they have secured employment.  The parolees \nthen return to the facility at night. \n25.  Defendants have not allowed Plaintiff the same opportunities as other parolees. \nThey have placed him on \"lock down\" status since his arrival at TCCC in 2002, and have \nconfined him in the jail most of the time.  Other parolees are not on perpetual \"lock down\" status \nand  may  leave  the jail with  considerably  greater  freedom.  Other parolees  are  allowed  to \nformulate a weekly schedule of activities outside of the jail, such as doctors' appointments, job \ninterviews, visits to the Department of Public Safety to obtain driver's licenses, etc.  Mr. Meza is \nroutinely denied these same opportunities. \n26.  Mr. Meza has made numerous good faith attempts to secure employment, but \nDefendants have thwarted him.  Since about June of 2004, Defendants have allowed Plaintiff \nonly  five  hours  per week of time at Project RIO  (Reintegration of Offenders),  the parolee \nemployment search program.  They allow other parolees virtually unlimited time at Project RIO. \nPrior to June 2004, Defendants did not allow Mr. Meza any access to these resources, even \n4 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 5 of 12\nthough his conditions of parole explicitly require him to \"actively seek employment.\" \n27.  Before Mr.  Meza can interview for a job, employment opportunities must be \nscreened by Defendants to ensure potential employment locations meet the conditions of his \nmandatory supervision.  Defendants habitually delay in screening the potential employers that \nPlaintiff has located,  causing the  identified positions to  be  filled  before  Mr.  Meza  has  the \nopportunity to interview for them.  Other parolees do not experience these chronic delays in their \njob searches. \n28.  On the rare occasion when Mr. Meza is able to secure a job interview, several \narmed guards accompany him to the interview.  On or about November 3, 2004, Mr. Meza had a \njob interview with Southern Education, and armed guards escorted him there.  Unsurprisingly, \nPlaintiff was  unable  to  secure  employment under  these  conditions.  Armed  guards  do  not \naccompany other TCCC parolees to job interviews. \n29.  Defendants have also told Mr. Meza that, should he find a job, an armed parole \nofficer will have to go to the job site with him every day.  The Board has made this requirement \na condition of Mr. Meza's mandatory supervision.  Potential employers have told Mr. Meza they \ncannot hire him for this reason.  Other parolees do not face this additional obstacle. \n30.  On August 21,2006, Mr. Meza had a job interview for a construction position with \nMissions of Hope Ministries.  Missions of Hope Ministries offered Mr. Meza the position the \nnext  day.  TDCJ,  Collier  and  the  Board,  however,  intentionally  delayed  approving  this \nemployment opportunity until the position was no longer available. \n31.  Before Mr. Meza can accept any job opportunity, the offer of employment must be \nscreened by TDCJ's investigators, and then approved by the Board.  No other parolee is required \nto have his job opportunities approved by the Board.  No condition of Mr. Meza's release states \nthat job opportunities will have to be approved by the Board. \n5 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 6 of 12\n32.  As the director of the Parole Division, Collier has personally overseen all decisions \nregarding Mr.  Meza's parole.  Over the past three years,  Mr.  Meza's counsel attempted to \nnegotiate removal of these informal conditions with TDC] officials, including Collier.  He was \npersonally aware of the violations of Mr. Meza's due process rights, but deliberately continued to \nimpose  these  informal,  illegal  conditions.  Collier  reasonably  should  have  known  he  was \nviolating Mr. Meza's due process rights. \n33.  Because Defendants' actions have prevented him from securing a job, Mr. Meza's \nliberty is considerably more restricted than other parolees on mandatory supervision at TCCC. \nDefendants allow other parolees to leave the facility and work in the community. \n34.  Mr.  Meza has been denied educational opportunities that are offered to other \nparolees at TCCC, even though his conditions of parole require him to \"attend educational and \nvocational training classes.\"  Mr.  Meza has not been allowed to attend computer orientation \nclasses, job search classes and resume writing classes offered to other parolees at TCCC.  Mr. \nMeza has only been allowed to attend three onewday seminars offered at Project RIO, and even \nthen has been pulled out of the classes in the middle of the seminars because he is only allowed \ntwo and a half hours twice a week at Project RIO. \n35.  Denying Mr. Meza these educational opportunities also has negatively impacted \nhis job search and thus unduly restrained his liberty.  For example, in order to take full advantage \nof the limited amount of time he has access to Project RIO, Mr. Meza needs effective computer \nskills.  Due to his long incarceration and Defendants' refusal to allow him the same educational \nopportunities they offer other parolees, Plaintiff has been unable to develop these necessary skills \nalong with other parolees. \n36.  Mr. Meza has not been allowed to obtain a driver's license, a privilege allowed to \nother parolees at TeCe.  Indeed, Mr. Meza's conditions of parole imply he should be allowed to \n6 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 7 of 12\nobtain a driver's license, as the conditions explicitly require him to \"obey driving restrictions,\" \n\"obtain and keep  in  [his]  possession a Texas Department of Public  Safety  (DPS)  Personal \nIdentification Card or Driver's License,\" and \"leave all keys to any motor vehicle that [he has] \nuse of with facility staff' of any half-way house he may be allowed to reside at.  Without a \ndriver's license, certain employment opportunities are unavailable to Mr.  Meza (such as auto \nrepair positions).  Mr. Meza has been denied employment by auto repair facilities because he \ndoes not have a driver's license. \n37.  Defendants have not afforded Mr. Meza any due process of law to justify his \ndisparate treatment at TCCe.  No conditions of Plaintiffs mandatory supervision justify this \ndisparate treatment. \n38.  The conditions imposed on Mr. Meza's mandatory supervision by the Board are \nirrational, arbitrary and capricious.  For example, Mr. Meza is required to wear an electronic \nglobal positioning tracking monitor at all times.  The monitor informs Defendants ofMr. Meza's \nlocation at all times.  Mr. Meza is also not allowed to leave TCCC without being accompanied \nby a parole officer, despite the electronic monitor.  These conditions are intentionally redundant \nand thus arbitrary and capricious.  These conditions were imposed without due process of law, \nand have  an intentionally discriminatory purpose.  Only one other parolee  in the state has \nconditions as onerous as those imposed on Mr. Meza. \n39.  The Parole Division, at Collier's direction, intentionally refuses to provide Mr. \nMeza with a parole officer to accompany him so that he may leave the jail.  This creates a de \nfacto qualitative restriction on Mr. Meza's liberty, which has been imposed without due process \noflaw. \n40.  On February 23,2005, Mr. Meza received a notice informing him the Board was \nreimposing sex offender conditions on his parole, and that he had one month to respond.  Mr. \n7 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 8 of 12\nMeza promptly filed a response.  This notice was never served on his attorneys, who TDCJ and \nthe Board knew represented him, in violation of Rule 4.02(a) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.  (Three members of the Board, Aliseda, Aycock and Garcia, are attorneys \nlicensed in the State of Texas who are required to comply with the Texas Disciplinary Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.) \n41.  TDCJ and the Board ignored Mr. Meza's response, and imposed sex offender \nconditions on his  parole without affording  him due process,  in violation of the  holding of \nColeman  v.  Dretke,  395  F.3d 216  (5th  Cir.  2004).  Mr.  Meza's  attorneys  contacted TDCJ \nregarding this abuse of due process, and were ignored.  The sex offender conditions remain \nimposed on Mr. Meza's parole. \n42.  Mr. Meza is a Christian.  His religious faith is sincere and heartfelt, and assisted his \nefforts to rehabilitate himself. \n43.  In order to attend worship services at the TCCC, Defendants require inmates to \ndress in prison uniforms.  Plaintiff finds this requirement demeans his religious activities, and \nacts as a substantial burden on his religious exercise.  Other parolees are allowed to leave the jail \nto attend worship services.  Mr. Meza is forced to attend services with inmates at the jail instead \nof in the community, like other parolees. \n44.  On September 13, 2006, Mr. Meza's beloved cousin died in an auto accident in \nAustin.  Mr. Meza requested permission to attend her funeral mass and services on September \n15, 2006.  Prisoners confined by TDCJ are allowed \"emergency absence\" to \"attend a funeral.\" \nTex. Gov't Code ยง 501.006 (2006).  TDCJ denied Mr. Meza the opportunity to participate in \nthese services.  Refusing Mr. Meza the opportunity to attend these services was a substantial \nburden on his religious exercise. \n8 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 9 of 12\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nI.  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\") \n45.  Mr. Meza alleges a cause of action because TDCJ and the Board do not allow Mr. \nMeza to attend worship services in the community, like other parolees, and did not allow him the \nopportunity to attend his cousin's funeral.  Defendants' actions and policies impose substantial \nburdens on Mr. Meza's religious freedom. \n46.  Under RLUIP A, \"no government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious \nexercise  of a person residing in or confined to  an  institution\" unless the  burden  furthers  a \n\"compelling governmental interest,\" and does so by \"the least restrictive means.\"  42 U.s.c. ยงยง \n2000cc-l(a)(I)-(2).  A religious exercise is any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled \nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000cc-5(7)(A). \n47.  The  Act covers  government-run  institutions,  including jails  and  transitional \nfacilities.  TCCC falls under RLUIPA's definition of government, and, therefore, is responsible \nfor accommodating Mr. Meza's religious beliefs. \nII.  Section 1983 \n48.  The TDCJ Defendants and the Board impose qualitatively different conditions of \nconfinement upon Mr. Meza than other similarly situated parolees.  The informal imposition of \nthese additional conditions upon Mr. Meza alone violates his due process rights. \n49.  The TDCJ Defendants enforce informal restrictions on Mr. Meza's liberty that \nhave not been justified by due process and are not provided for in any of his conditions of parole. \nThey habitually treat Mr. Meza differently from other similarly situated parolees on mandatory \nsupervision so as to deny Mr. Meza the opportunities afforded to others. \n50.  The Board has imposed sex offender conditions on Mr. Meza's parole without \nproviding him due process, in violation of law and his Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n9 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 10 of 12\n51.  Defendant Collier personally oversees all decisions regarding Mr. Meza's parole. \nCollier has been informed that the qualitatively different treatment of Mr. Meza violates his due \nprocess rights, but continues to enforce the illegal and informal conditions which are unspecified \nin Mr. Meza's conditions of parole. \n52.  The Board has imposed irrational, arbitrary and capricious conditions on Mr. \nMeza's mandatory supervision without affording him due process of law.  These conditions are \nqualitatively different than the conditions imposed on other parolees released after completion of \ntheir sentences for similar convictions. \nDAMAGES \n53.  Mr.  Meza is entitled to compensatory relief from all Defendants, jointly and \nseverally, for lost wages and loss of liberty. \n54.  Plaintiff also seeks punitive damages from the rDC] Defendants. \nDECLARATORY mDGMENT \n55.  Mr. Meza seeks declaratory judgment to vindicate his rights under Section 1983 \nand RLUIPA with respect to Defendants' violations. \n56.  Mr. Meza is entitled to declaratory judgment concerning Defendants' violations of \nhis due process rights. \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n57.  Mr. Meza seeks injunctive relief, permanently enjoining Defendants from: \na.  Failing to reasonably accommodate his  religious exercise, including requiring \nparolees to wear jail uniforms in order to attend worship services and imposing \nworship service policies not serving a compelling governmental interest; and, \nb.  Continuing  to  subject  Mr.  Meza  to  qualitatively  different  conditions  of \nconfinement without due process of law; and, \nc.  Imposing sex offender conditions upon his parole without due process oflaw. \n10 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 11 of 12\n58.  Inasmuch as Defendants have acted in the events described herein, they will \ncontinue to act accordingly.  Without injunctive relief, Defendants will continue their outrageous \nconduct, thereby unduly limiting Mr. Meza's liberty without due process. \nATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS \n59.  Mr. Meza is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation costs, and court costs, \npursuant to 42 U.S.c. ยง 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Mr. Meza respectfully prays that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Enter judgment on his behalf against the TDC] Defendants in their individual \ncapacities and  the  Travis  County  Sheriff, jointly and  severally,  for  monetary \ndamages sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for his lost wages; \nB.  Issue declaratory relief that Defendants' conduct constituted illegal deprivation of \nPlaintiffs due process rights; \nC.  Order injunctive relief against Defendant Collier in his official capacity to end \nfurther prevention of the exercise of religious freedom of Plaintiff and TCCC \nparolees to prohibit the violation of Mr. Meza's rights under RLUIPA; \nD.  Grant reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and court costs; and \nE.  Grant all other and additional relief to which Mr. Meza may be entitled, at law or \nin equity. \nDATED: February 23, 2007. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nTEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT \n1405 Montopolis Dr. \nAustin, TX 78741 \n11 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 96   Filed 02/27/07   Page 12 of 12\n(512) 474-5073 [phone] \n(512) 474-0726 [fax] \nATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFF \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nA true copy this document was sent to Assistant Attorney General of Texas, Celamaine Cunniff, \nP.O.

Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on Plaintiff Raul Meza's religious \nexercise while he has been incarcerated at the Travis County Correctional Complex (TCCC), Del \nValle facility, in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 \n(\"RLUIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc (2000). \n2.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. ยง 1983, Defendants have, without due process oflaw, imposed \nconditions upon Plaintiff Meza's incarceration that are qualitatively different from the punishment \ntypically imposed on other parolees  at  the Del  Valle facility,  in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, \n3.  Pursuantto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983,Mr. Meza elaims that Defendant individual parole officers \n\\ \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 2 of 9\nviolated  his  Fourteenth  Amendment  due  process  rights  by  imposing  additional  infonnal, \nunauthorized conditions on his confinement without due process oflaw. \n4.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. ยง 1983, Mr. Meza claims that policy and custom of the TCCC's \nDel Valle facility, described herein, resulted in violations ofh is Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights. \n5.  Mr. Meza seeks damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs \nas a result of Defendants' violations. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343. \n7.  Further, Defendants' actions and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Del \nValle, Texas.  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง1 391, venue is proper for this Court. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff is confined at the TCCC facility in Del Valle. \n9.  Defendant Sheriff of Travis County can be served with process through 501 W. 11th \nStreet, Austin, TX 78701.  He is responsible for the operation ofthe TCCC facility in Del Valle. \n10.  Defendant Brad Livingston is the executive director of the Texas Department of \nCriminal Justice (\"TDCJ\"). \n11.  Defendant Brian Collier is the director of the TDCJ Parole Division. \n12.  In all the actions described herein, Defendant parole officers, Defendant Collier and \nDefendant Livingston (\"TDCJ Defendants\") each were acting under color of law and pursuant to \nlegal authority.  Defendant parole officers and Defendant Collier are each sued in their official and \nindividual capacities; Defendant Livingston is sued only in his official capacity. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 3 of 9\n13.  On or about March 8, 1982, Plaintiff pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to thirty \n(30) years imprisonment in Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facilities. \n14.  On or about September 8, 1989, Plaintiff was sentenced to four (4) additional years \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively to the thirty (30) year term, for possession of a deadly \nweapon in a penal institution. \n15.  TDCJ released Plaintiff to the custody of Defendant Sheriff of Travis County on or \nabout  September  25,  2002,  on  \"mandatory  supervision.\"  Plaintiffs release  on  mandatory \nsupervision was required by statute because his calendar time served plus \"good time\" credits \naccumulated totaled the maximum length of his sentence.  See Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. 42.18(8)(c) \n(1987). \n16.  Mandatory supervision is \"the release of a prisoner from imprisonment, but not on \nparole, and not from the legal custody of the state, for rehabilitation outside prison walls under such \nconditions and provisions for disciplinary supervision as the board may determine.\" Tex. Crim. Pro. \nArt. 42. 18(2)(b) (1987). The purpose of mandatory supervision is \"to aid all prisoners to readjust to \nsociety upon completion of their period of incarceration.\" Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. 42.18(1) (1987). \n17.  Parolees on mandatory supervision at TCCC are allowed to search for a job in the \ncommunity and to leave the facility to work when they have secured employment. The parolees then \nreturn to the facility at night. \n18.  Defendants have not allowed Plaintiff the same opportunities as other parolees.  They \nhave placed him on \"lock down\" status since his arrival at Tcee in 2002, and have confined him \nto his room most of the time.  Other parolees are not on perpetual \"lock down\" status and may leave \ntheir cells with considerably greater freedom. \n19.  Mr.  Meza has made numerous good faith attempts to secure employment, but \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 4 of 9\nDefendant parole officers have thwarted him.  Since about June of2004, Defendants have allowed \nPlaintiff only five hours per week of time at Project RIO (Reintegration of Offenders), the parolee \nemployment search program.  They allow other parolees virtually unlimited time at Project RIO. \nPrior to June 2004, Defendants did not allow Mr. Meza any access to these resources. \n20.  Before Mr. Meza can interview for ajob, employment opportunities must be screened \nby Defendant parole officers to ensure that potential employment locations meet the conditions of \nhis mandatory supervision.  Defendant parole officers habitually delay in screening the potential \nemployers that Plaintiffhas located, causing the identified positions to be filled before Mr. Meza has \nIeee \nthe opportunity to interview for them. Other  parolees do not experience these chronic delays \nin their job searches. \n21.  On the rare occasion when Mr. Meza is able to secure ajob interview, several armed \nguards accompany him to the interview.  On or about November 3, 2004, Mr. Meza had a job \ninterview with Southern Education, and armed guards escorted him there. Unsurprisingly, Plaintiff \nwas unable to secure employment under these conditions.  Armed guards do not accompany other \nIeee \nparolees to job interviews. \n22.  Defendants have also told Mr. Meza that, should he find a job, an armed parole officer \nwill have to go to the job site with him every day.  Potential employers have told Mr. Meza  they \ncannot hire him for this reason.  Other parolees do not face this additional obstacle. \n23. Because Defendants' actions have prevented him from securing a job, Mr. Meza's liberty \nIeee. \nis considerably more restricted than other parolees on mandatory supervision at  Defendants \nallow other parolees to leave the facility and work in the community. \n24.  Mr. Meza has been denied educational opportunities that are offered to other parolees \nIeee. \nat  Mr. Meza has not been allowed to attend computer orientation classes, job search classes \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 5 of 9\nand resume writing classes offered to other parolees at TCCC.  Mr. Meza has only been allowed to \nattend three one-day seminars offered at Project RIO, and even then has been pulled out of the \nclasses in the middle of the seminars because he is only allowed two and a half hours twice a week \nat Project RIO. \n25.  Denying Mr. Meza these educational opportunities also has negatively impacted his \njob search and thus unduly restrained his liberty. For example, in order to take full advantage ofthe \nlimited amount oft ime he has access to Project RIO, Mr. Mezaneeds effective computer skills. Due \nto his long incarceration and Defendants' refusal to allow him the same educational opportunities \nthey offer other parolees, Plaintiffhas been unable to develop these necessary skills along with other \nparolees. \n26.  Mr. Meza has not been allowed to obtain a driver's license, a privilege allowed to other \nparolees at TCCC. Without a driver's license, certain employment opportunities are unavailable to \nMr. Meza (such as auto repair positions).  Mr. Meza has been denied employment by auto repair \nfacilities because he does not have a driver's license. \n27.  Defendants have not afforded Mr. Meza any due process oflaw to justify his disparate \ntreatment at TCCC.  No conditions of Plaintiffs mandatory supervision justify this disparate \ntreatment. \n28.  On February 23,2005, Mr. Meza received a notice informing him that TDCJ was \nreimposing sex offender conditions on his parole, and that he had one month to respond.  Mr. Meza \npromptly filed  a response.  This notice was never served on his attorneys, who TDCJ knew \nrepresented him, in violation of Rule 4.02(a) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional \nConduct. \n29.  TDCJ ignored Mr. Meza's response, and imposed sex offender conditions on his parole \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 6 of 9\nwithout affording him due process, in violation of the holding of Coleman v. Dretke, 395 FJ  d 216 \n(5th Cir. 2004). Mr. Meza's attorneys contacted TDCJ regarding this abuse of due process, and were \nignored.  The sex offender conditions remain imposed on Mr. Meza's parole. \n30.  Mr. Meza is a Christian.  His religious faith is sincere and heartfelt, and assisted his \nefforts to rehabilitate himself. \n31.  In order to attend worship services at the TCCC, Defendants require parolees to dress \nin prison uniforms.  Plaintiff finds this requirement demeans his religious activities, and acts as a \nsubstantial burden on his religious exercise. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n1.  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIP A\") \n(as to Defendant Sheriff of Travis County) \n32.  Mr. Meza alleges a cause of action because agents of Travis County prohibit him from \nattending religious services unless he dons a prison uniform.  Defendants' actions and policies \nimpose substantial burdens on Mr. Meza's religious freedom. \n33.  Under RLUIPA, \"no government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious \nexercise  of a person residing in or confined to  an  institution\" unless  the burden  furthers  a \n\"compelling governmental interest,\" and does so by \"the least restrictive means.\"  42 U.S.C.  ยงยง \n2000cc-1 (a)(l )-(2).  A religious exercise is any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, \nor central to, a system of religious belief.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000cc-5(7)(A). \n34.  The Act covers government-run institutions, including jails and transitional facilities. \nTCCC  falls  under  RLUIPA's  definition  of government,  and,  therefore,  is  responsible  for \naccommodating Mr. Meza's religious beliefs. \nII.  Section 1983 (as to TDCJ Defendants) \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 7 of 9\n35.  The TDCJ Defendants impose qualitatively different conditions of confinement upon \nMr. Meza. The infonnal imposition ofthese additional conditions upon Mr. Meza alone violate his \ndue process rights. \n36. The TDCJ Defendants enforce infonnal restrictions on Mr. Meza's liberty that have not \nbeen justified by due process.  They habitually treat Mr. Meza differently from other parolees on \nmandatory supervision so as to deny Mr. Meza the opportunities afforded to others. \n37.  The TDCJ Defendants have imposed sex offender conditions on Mr. Meza's parole \nwithout providing him due process, in violation oflaw and his Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nDAMAGES \n38.  Mr. Meza is entitled to compensatory relief from all Defendants, jointly and severally, \nfor lost wages and loss of liberty. \n39.  Plaintiff also seeks punitive damages from the TDCJ Defendants. \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n40.  Mr. Meza seeks declaratory judgment to vindicate his rights under Section 1983 and \nRLUIP A with respect to Defendants' violations. \n41.  Mr. Meza is entitled to declaratory judgment concerning Defendants' violations of his \ndue process rights. \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n42.  Mr. Meza seeks injunctive relief, pennanently enjoining Defendants from: \na.  Failing to  reasonably accommodate his  religious  exercise, including requiring \nparolees to wear jail unifonns in order to attend worship services and imposing \nworship service policies not serving a compelling governmental interest; and, \nb.  Continuing to subject Mr. Meza to qualitatively different conditions of confinement \nwithout due process of law; and, \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 1   Filed 12/05/05   Page 8 of 9\nc.  Imposing sex offender conditions upon his parole without due process oflaw. \n43.  Inasmuch as Defendants have acted in the events described herein, they will continue \nto act accordingly.  Without injunctive relief, Defendants will continue their outrageous conduct, \nthereby unduly limiting Mr. Meza's liberty without due process. \nATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS \n44.  Mr. Meza is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation costs, and court costs, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Mr. Meza respectfully prays that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Enter judgment on his behalf against the TDCJ Defendants in their individual \ncapacities and the Travis County Sheriff, jointly and severally, for monetary damages \nsufficient to compensate Plaintiff for his lost wages; \nB.  Issue declaratory relief that Defendants' conduct constituted illegal deprivation of \nPlaintiffs due process rights; \nC.  Order injunctive relief against Defendant Travis County Sheriff to  end further \nprevention of the exercise of religious freedom of Plaintiff and TCCC parolees to \nprohibit the violation of Mr. Meza's rights under RLUIP A; \nD.  Grant reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and court costs; and \nE.  Grant all other and additional relief to which Mr. Meza may be entitled, at law or in \nequity. \nDATED: December 2, 2005 \nRespectfully Submitted, \n~~W.0 0+tht~) \n,  Jaynes C. Harrington \nI \n.

The motions and responses were referred to the United States Magistrate \nJudge for report and recommendation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(I), Rule 72 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 1( d) of Appendix C of the Local Rules of the United States \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 2 of 10\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Texas, as amended. The Magistrate Judge filed his Report \nand Recommendation on August 28, 2006 (Doc. #26).  The parties were notified that objections to \nthe Report and Recommendation were due within ten days after the parties were served with a copy \nof the Report.  On September 11, 2006,  Livingston and Collier filed their Objections to the \nMagistrate's Report and Recommendation (Doc. #29). Plaintiff Raul Meza filed no objection to the \nReport and Recommendation. \nIn the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge recommended \nthat the Court grant Livingston and Collier's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 12) as to the monetary claims \nagainst Livingston and Collier in their official capacities, and deny the motion as to the claims \nagainst Livingston and Collier for injunctive relief. The Magistrate Judge further recommended that \nthe Court deny Livingston and Collier's Supplemental Motion to Dismiss (Doc #14).  Finally, the \nMagistrate Judge recommended that the Court deny Collier's motion to dismiss and grant Collier's \nmotion for Rule 7(a) reply (Doc. #16), and order that Meza file a reply in accordance with Rule 7(a) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  When responding to Livingston and Collier's objections, \nthis Court will undertake a de novo review of the entire case file in this action.  For findings and \nlegal conclusions to which the parties did not object, the Court undertakes a  review. \nplain~error \nAfter conducting such a review, the Court finds that the Report and Recommendation filed by the \nMagistrate Judge is correct and should be approved and accepted by the Court for the reasons stated \ntherein, and the issues not addressed by the Magistrate Judge will be referred for further report and \nrecommendation. \nA.  Eleventh amendment immunity \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 3 of 10\nMeza does not object to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that this Court dismiss his \nclaims for monetary relief against Livingston and Collier in their official capacity pursuant to the \nEleventh Amendment.  Therefore, Meza is barred from attacking on appeal the unobjected-to \nproposed legal conclusions accepted by the district court, except on grounds of plain error.  See \nDouglass v. United Services Auto Ass 'n, 79 FJd 1415 (5th Cir. 1996)(en bane). Having reviewed \nthe record, this Court finds no plain error and accepts the Magistrate Judge's recommendation to \ndeny Meza's request for monetary damages in the official capacity. \nB.  Collier's qualified immunity \nRegarding Collier's assertion of qualified immunity against suits in his individual capacity, \nthe Magistrate Judge recommended that this Court deny Collier's motion to dismiss and grant \nCollier's motion for a Rule 7(a) reply.  The Magistrate Judge found that Meza's First Amended \nComplaint does not contain the required specific facts demonstrating Collier's personal involvement, \nand recommended that Meza file a reply.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 7(a). \n\"When a public official pleads the affirmative defense of qualified immunity in his answer, \nthe district court may, on the official's motion or on its own, require the plaintiff to reply to that \ndefense in detail. By definition, the reply must be tailored to the assertion of qualified immunity and \nfairly engage its allegations.\"  Schultea v.  Wood, 47 FJd 1427, 1433 (5th Cir. 1995). This Court \nfinds no error in the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and will, therefore, order Meza \nto submit a reply, which shall be tailored to Collier's qualified immunity defenses. See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. Rule 7(a).  In particular, Meza shall support each of his claims against Collier with sufficient \nparticularity to establish Collier's personal involvement in the conduct at the time of the alleged \nunconstitutional acts. \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 4 of 10\nc. \nMeza's Section 1983 claims are not barred by Heck v. Humphrey. \nLivingston and Collier object to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that the Court deny \nLivingston and Collier's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. #1 2) and Supplemental Motion to Dismiss (Doc. \n#14).  Meza has brought a cause of action claiming violations of his constitutional and statutory \nrights. Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (2000) (\"Section 1983\"). Livingston and Collier \nargue that Meza is barred from using Section 1983 to challenge the conditions of his mandatory \nsupervision and the imposition of sex -offender conditions. Livingston and Collier therefore request \nthat the Court deny Plaintiff s claims for prospective injunctive relief.  They support their assertion \nwith the principles set forth in Heck v. Humphrey, wherein the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff \nwho  had  been  convicted  of a  crime  cannot  bring  a  Section  1983  claim  challenging  the \nconstitutionality of his conviction or imprisonment unless that conviction had been reversed, \nexpunged, declared invalid, or called into question by federal habeas corpus. 512 U.S. 477, 486-87 \n(1994) . \n. . . [A] state prisoner's ยง 1983 action is barred (absent prior invalidation)-no matter \nthe relief sought (damages or equitable relief), no matter the target of the prisoner's \nsuit (state conduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings)-ifs uccess \nin that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its \nduration. \nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 81 (2005). Furthermore, Heck also applies to parole proceedings \nthat call into question the \"fact or duration of parole.\"  Jackson v.  Vannoy, 49 FJd 175 (5th Cir. \n1995). \nLivingston and Collier assert that the proper method to challenge the fact or duration of \nparole is through a federal habeas corpus proceeding.  28 U.S.C. ยง 2254 (2000).  The Magistrate \nJudge found that Meza is not challenging the fact or duration of his mandatory supervision, because \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 5 of 10\nif Meza were to prevail on every argument, it does not appear from his complaint that he would be \nreleased earlier from his mandatory supervision.  Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge held that \nbecause Meza' s success on his claims would not necessitate a finding that his mandatory supervision \nor its duration is invalid, Meza's claims are cognizable under Section 1983 and are not barred by \nHeck. \nIn their objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation, Livingston and \nCollier cite Coleman v.  Dretke, in which the court of appeals granted a prisoner's habeas corpus \npetition challenging the revocation of his release on mandatory supervision. 409 FJd 665, 670 (5th \nCir. 2005) (en banc).  The parole board had imposed sex-offender conditions on Coleman, and his \nparole had been revoked for failing to submit to sex-offender therapy.  Id.  at 666.  Although the \nCourt in Coleman granted habeas corpus relief, the circuit did not rule that a claim under Section \n1983 would be barred. The circuit specifically noted that the two avenues of relief were not mutually \nexclusive: \"[T]here are undoubtedly some instances where a prisoner has the option of proceeding \neither by petition for habeas corpus or by suits under ยง 1983.\" Id. at 670. \nMoreover, the prisoner in Coleman challenged the validity of his parole conditions after his \nparole was revoked for violation ofthe challenged conditions, thereby seeking \"release from physical \nconfinement in prison.\" Id. at 669.  In contrast, Meza is preemptively challenging the conditions of \nhis parole, without any revocation.  A successful suit in Coleman would  \"necessarily demonstrate \nthe invalidity of confinement\" by challenging the fact or duration in confinement,  see Wilkinson, \n544 U.S. at 81; in contrast, success in Meza's case would not necessarily challenge the fact or \nduration of the mandatory supervision. \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 6 of 10\nLivingston and Collier argue that unlike prisoners, where the difference between a civil-rights \naction and a collateral attack is easy to describe, the question for parolees is more \"metaphysical.\" \nThey acknowledge that challenges to the conditions of confinement fall under Section 1983, and \nattacks on the fact or duration of the confinement fall within the realm of habeas corpus. They then \nargue that the conditions of parole are the confinement, and that it is because of the conditions that \nparolees remain \"in custody\" on their unexpired sentences and thus may initiate a habeas corpus \nproceeding while on parole.  See Jones v.  Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 242-43 (1963); see also \nMaleng v.  Cook, 490 U.S. 488, 491 (1989); Williams v.  Wisconsin, 336 F.3d 576, 579 (7th Cir. \n2003); Drollinger v.  Milligan,  552 F.2d 1220,  1225 (7th Cir.  1977) (observing that lifting of \nprobation condition frees the prisoner from confinement, \"figuratively speaking,\" by removing \nrestrictive condition). \nThe cases are inapposite to the case at bar, because both cases exclusively deal with habeas \ncorpus.  In Jones the issue before the Supreme Court was whether a parolee was \"in custody\" such \nthat the parolee was entitled to invoke the \"habeas corpus jurisdiction of the United States District \nCourt\" to challenge the constitutionality of his conviction.  Jones, 371 U.S. at 239.  The question \nin Maleng was \"whether a habeas petitioner remains 'in custody' under a conviction after the \nsentence imposed for it has fully expired, merely because\" of the use of the prior conviction for \nsentence enhancement.  Id at 490.  Neither case pertains to a Section 1983 action; therefore, the \nauthority cited by Livingston and Collier is not controlling. \nIn their objections to the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation, Livingston and Collier \nalso cite to Williams v. Wisconsin and Drollinger v. Milligan.  These cases were decided prior to the \nSupreme Court's Wilkinson decision and stand for the proposition that the appropriate avenue for \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 7 of 10\nchallenging probation or parole conditions is through a federal habeas corpus proceeding, not \nthrough a claim under Section 1983. Drollin~er, 552 F.2d at 1225; Williams, 336 FJd at 579. The \nDrollinger court reasoned: \nBecause probation is by its nature less confining than incarceration, the distinction \nbetween the fact of confinement and the conditions thereof is necessarily blurred. \nThe elimination or substitution, for  example, of one of the conditions of . . . \nprobation  would  free  [the  probationer]  substantially  from  ... confinement; \nfiguratively speaking, one of the \"bars\" would be removed from [the probationer's] \ncell. \nDrollinger, 552 F.2d at 1225; see also Williams, 336 FJd at 579 (\"[T]he conditions of parole are \nthe confinement. ... It is because of these restrictions that parolees remain 'in custody' on their \nunexpired sentences and thus may initiate a collateral attack while on parole.\").  Significant to the \ndecisions is the view that probation and parole conditions are part of the sentence; by attacking such \nconditions, the civil-rights plaintiff would essentially be \"seeking release from at least part of [the] \nsentence.\" See Drollinger, 552 F.2d at 1225. \nAn analysis of Wilkinson is instructive to the issue. Wilkinson holds that a prisoner could use \nSection 1983 to challenge the constitutionality of state parole procedures, and a prisoner is not \nrequired to seek relief exclusively through habeas corpus.  Wilkinson, 544 U.S. at 84.  The state in \nWilkinson contended that bringing a claim under Section 1983 to challenge the procedures used to \ndeny  prisoners  parole  was  improper,  as  \"parole  proceedings  are  part  of the  prisoners' \n'sentences'-indeed, an aspect of the  'sentences'  that the  ยง 1983  claims,  if successful, will \ninvalidate.\"  Id. at 83.  The Supreme Court rejected this argument, explaining that Heck \"uses the \nword 'sentence' to refer not to prison procedures, but to substantive determinations as to the length \noft he confinement.\" Id.  (emphasis added).  The Wilkinson Court elaborated that it has \"repeatedly \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 8 of 10\npermitted  prisoners  to  bring  ยง  1983  actions  challenging  the  conditions  of  their \nconfinement-conditions that, were [the State] right, might be considered part ofthe 'sentence.'\" \nId. at 84.  Wilkinson's reasoning extends to the case at bar, in that the conditions imposed during \nmandatory supervision are not part of the sentence.  Meza will become a free person when his \nsentence expires, not by removal of a condition of mandatory supervision. \nThis Court accepts the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation.  The Court holds \nthat attacking the conditions of mandatory supervision, including the imposition of sex-offender \nconditions, is not a challenge to the fact or duration of the mandatory supervision, and Meza's \nSection 1983 action is not barred by the Heck doctrine. \nD.  Due process as to imposition of sex-offender conditions and conditions of mandatory \nsupervision \nLivingston and Collier further object to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation \non the grounds that there is no justiciable interest in Meza' s claim that the imposition of sex -offender \nconditions deprived him of due-process rights.  Defendants argue that the Board of Pardons and \nParoles gave Meza one month's notice and the opportunity to be heard.  See Coleman, 409 FJd at \n670. This issue was raised in Livingston and Collier's Supplemental Motion to Dismiss (Doc #14), \nin what appears to be little more than an afterthought, and did not address what process is due in the \ncontext of imposing sex-offender conditions.  Furthermore, the issue was not addressed by the \nMagistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation.  The Court will therefore refer the issue of what \nprocess is due in the imposition of sex-offender conditions to the Magistrate Judge for further report \nand recommendation. \n8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 52   Filed 12/06/06   Page 9 of 10\nIn  addition,  Livingston  and  Collier  object  to  the  Magistrate  Judge's  Report  and \nRecommendation on the grounds that Meza has failed to state a claim that rises to the level of a \nconstitutional violation.  In particular, they point to Meza's claims of not having prospective \nemployment opportunities screened fast enough and the inability to obtain a driver's license. \nAlthough not artfully pleaded, Meza appears to be asserting a constitutional violation under the \nEqual Protection Clause.  See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ยง 1.  In his Amended Complaint, Meza \nrepeatedly compares his status to that of other parolees.  For example, his job screening is delayed \ncompared to other parolees; he receives less time than other parolees to search for jobs; he cannot \nobtain a drivers license, and he has less freedom in formulating a weekly schedule.  The equal \nprotection arguments have not been adequately briefed to this Court and are not addressed in the \nMagistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation. The Court will therefore refer the equal-protection \nissues to the Magistrate Judge for further report and recommendation. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the United States Magistrate Judge's Report and \nRecommendation filed in this cause is hereby APPROVED and ACCEPTED AS FOLLOWS: \n1.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge: \nRaul  Meza,  an  inmate  on  supervised  release  at  the  Texas  County \nCorrectional  Complex,  filed  Fourteenth  Amendment  claims  against  state \nofficials!  and the Sheriff of Travis County on December 5,  2005.  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity was asserted in several motions, including a  motion to \ndismiss on May 22, 2006, and a motion to dismiss and alternative motion for \nRule 7(a) reply filed by Collier, Jenkins' predecessor, on June 27,  2006.  The \nThe original complaint named the former director of the Texas Department of \n1 \nCriminal Justice Parole Division, Brian Collier. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 286   Filed 08/18/08   Page 3 of 7\nNo. 07-50756 \n, district court referred these motions to a magistrate judge for recommendation \nor resolution on June 30,  2006.  The magistrate judge issued a  report and \nrecommendation on August 28, 2006, stating, \"Plaintiffs claims for injunctive \nrelief ... should not be dismissed, as they are cognizable under Ex Parte Young.\" \nOn December 6, 2006, the district court accepted the recommendations, granting \nDefendants' first motion to dismiss with respect to Meza's monetary claims \nagainst Livingston and Collier in their official capacity and denying Defendants' \nmotion with respect to prospective injunctive relief.  For Collier's motion to \ndismiss and motion for a Rule 7(a) reply, the court denied the motion to dismiss \nbut granted Collier's motion for a Rule 7(a) reply,2 ordering Meza to reply and \ndescribe Collier's personal involvement in the alleged unconstitutional acts. \nMeza replied. \nOn June 30,  2006, Meza filed an amended complaint.  Livingston and \nCollier filed  a second motion to dismiss on February 7,  2007,  again raising \nEleventh Amendment imm unity claims. Livingston and Collier then submitted \na joint motion for summary judgment on March 14, 2007.  The court found that \nthe summary judgment arguments were \"duplicative of those contained\" in the \npending second motions to dismiss and concluded, \"The Court will therefore \ndismiss Livingston and Collier's motions to dismiss and will consider Livingston \nand Collier's arguments as submitted in their pending motions for summary \njudgment.\"  In this same order, the court referred the motions for summary \njudgment to the magistrate judge on May 1, 2007. \nDefendants filed two motions to stay the pretrial conference hearing and \ntrial setting with the district court and an emergency motion to stay with this \ncourt, which we denied.  On June 26,  2007, the district court held the final \npretrial hearing and stated, \nThis was of course in the context of qualified immunity. \n2 \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 286   Filed 08/18/08   Page 4 of 7\nNo. 07-50756 \nThese [immunity] motions, I believe, were filed on March the 14th \nand referred to [the] Magistrate Judge ...  who has them under \nadvisement at this time,  and, therefore, I will have them under \nadvisement. ... \nI want the record to be very clear that I have never refused to rule \non any of the immunity motions that are before me  .... Those \nmotions remain pending in front of me and you are not faced with \na refusal to rule. \nWhen the district court held its final pretrial hearing, the magistrate had \nnot yet issued a report on the Eleventh Amendment claims raised in Defendants' \nmotion for  summary judgment.3  The Eleventh Amendment question with \nrespect to summary judgment remained \"under advisement.\" \nOn appeal, Defendants argue that by \"failing\" to rule on the issue, the \ndistrict court has effectively refused to rule on immunity and that the refusal is \nan immediately appealable order under the collateral order doctrine.4  Meza \nargues that the appeal is an improper interlocutory appeal and that we do not \nhave jurisdiction to review it, as the court has not denied their immunity claims \non summary judgment, nor has it refused to rule.  He urges that Defendants \ncould have appealed the district court's December 6, 2006, denial of their motion \nto  dismiss - including the court's  denial  of their immunity  claims - as  a \ncollateral order but failed to do so.  Meza similarly maintains that Defendants' \nsummary judgment motion is essentially a motion to reconsider the district \ncourt's denial of plaintiffs' motion to dismiss and that an order denying a motion \nto reconsider is not appealable. Furthermore, Meza maintains, the district court \nThe magistrate's last report was issued on June 5, 2007. This report addressed other \n3 \nDefendants' claims, including Eleventh Amendment claims of Defendants Owens, Aliseda, \nAycock, Davis, DeNoyelles, Garcia, and Gonzales, but not Livingston and Jenkins' claims of \nEleventh Amendment immunity raised in their motion for summary judgment. \nSee Helton v. Clements, 787 F.2d 1016, 1017 (5th Cir. 1986) (per curiam). \n4 \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 286   Filed 08/18/08   Page 5 of 7\nNo. 07-50756 \n. has not refused to rule on the issue but was simply awaiting the magistrate's \nreport on the summary judgment motion when Defendants appealed. \nWe are persuaded that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  Instead \nof appealing the district court's December 6,2006, denial of Defendants' motion \nto dismiss, which included Eleventh Amendment immunity claims, 5 Defendants \nappeal the district court's failure to address their Eleventh Amendment claims \nin a motion for summary judgment that was being considered by the magistrate \njudge when Defendants appealed. This is an unreviewable interlocutory appeal. \n\"The denial of a summary judgment is generally not a final, appealable \norder.,,6  A district court's failure to rule on a summary judgment motion while \nawaiting a magistrate judge's report and recommendation on that motion is \nsimilarly unreviewable.  Here, although the initial briefing on the summary \njudgment motion was completed as of May 11, 2007, the magistrate ordered \nadditional briefing,  and Defendants appealed before the district court could \nreceive the magistrate's report. \n\"'[U]nderthe collateral order doctrine, a small class of interlocutory orders \nthat (1)  conclusively determine [\"the defendant's claim of right not to stand \ntrial\"f, (2) important issues, which are separate from the merits of the action, \nand  (3)  which  would  be  effectively  unreviewable  on  appeal  from  a  final \njudgment, are deemed 'final' for purposes of appeal.\"'s  In at least one case, we \nhave held that a district court's refusal to rule on a motion to dismiss containing \nWe are not persuaded by Meza's arguments that Defendants' failure to appeal the \n5 \ndenial of their motion to dismiss resulted in a waiver of their immunity claims or that their \nmotion for summary judgment was by necessity a motion to reconsider. We simply note that \nthe court ruled on the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue in denying Defendants' motion \nto dismiss with respect to Meza's claims for prospective injunctive relief. \nReyes v. City of Richmond, Tex., 287 F.3d 346, 350 (5th Cir. 2002). \n6 \n7 Helton, 787 F.2d at 1017 (quoting Mitchell V. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 527 (1985ยป. \n8 Reyes, 287 F.3d at 350 (quoting Cantu V.

Unlike  in  Helton,  the  district  court  ruled  on \ndefendants' motion to dismiss, denying their Eleventh Amendment immunity \nclaims with the exception of immunity from Meza's claims involving monetary \ndamages, a ruling that Defendants do not appeal here.  Although the district \ncourt has not yet ruled on Defendants' motion for summary judgment, it has not \nrefused to rule on that motion, stating that it has it \"under advisement.\"  In \nHelton,  in contrast, the district court made it clear that it would not rule on \nfurther immunity claims until trial, stating, \n[A]ll  parties  and  attorneys  are  here  notified  that  any  further \nmotions in this case will not be ruled upon by the court prior to trial \nbut will be carried along with the trial of the case on the merits. \nThis ruling applies to any pending motions .... \n10 \nNor has the district court \"failed\" to rule on the motion.  It referred the \nmotion  to  the  magistrate  judge  for  a  report  and  recommendations,  and \nDefendants appealed before the court received the report,  thus temporarily \ndepriving that court of jurisdiction to grant or deny the motion. \nDefendants urge that \"[a]lthough this Court has not issued any further \npublished opinions [after Helton] recognizing other instances where the refusal \nor  failure  to  rule  resulted  in  an  immediately  appealable  order  under  the \ncollateral order doctrine,\" other circuits have.  In those cases, the district court \neither refused to rule, failed to explain its reasons for  delaying a ruling on \nqualified immunity until trial, or dismissed an immunity claim implicitly or in \nHelton, 787 F .2d at 10 17. \n9 \nId. \n10 \n5 \n\n.

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983, Defendants have,  without due process of law, \nimposed conditions upon Plaintiff Meza's incarceration that are qualitatively different from the \npunishment typically imposed on other similarly situated parolees, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n2.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983, Mr.  Meza claims that Defendants violated his \nFourteenth  Amendment  due  process  rights  by  imposing  additional  informal,  unauthorized \nconditions on his confinement without due process of law. \n3.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Mr. Meza claims that policy and custom of the Travis \nCounty  Correctional  Complex's  (TCCC)  Del  Valle  facility,  described  herein,  resulted  in \nviolations of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 2 of 10\n4.  Mr. Meza seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs as a \nresult of Defendants' violations. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  Jwisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343. \n6.  Further, Defendants' actions and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Del \nValle, Texas.  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391, venue is proper for this Court. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff is confined at the TCCC facility in Del Valle. \n8.  Defendant Brad Livingston is the executive director of the Texas Department of \nCriminal Justice (\"TDCJ\"). \n9.  Defendant Brian Collier is the director of the TDCJ Parole Division. \n10.

On or about March 8, 1982, Plaintiff pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to \nthirty (30) years imprisonment in Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facilities. \n20.  On or about September 8, 1989, Plaintiff was sentenced to four (4) additional years \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively to the thirty (30) year term, for possession of a deadly \nweapon in a penal institution. \n21.  TDCJ released Plaintiff to the custody of the Sheriff of Travis County on or about \nSeptember 25,2002, on \"mandatory supervision.\"  Plaintiffs release on mandatory supervision \nwas required by statute because his calendar time served plus \"good time\" credits accumulated \ntotaled the maximum length of his sentence.  See Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. 42.1S(S)(c) (1987). \n22.  Mandatory supervision is ''the release of a prisoner from imprisonment, but not on \nparole, and not from the legal custody of the state, for rehabilitation outside prison walls under \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 4 of 10\nsuch conditions and provisions for disciplinary supervision as the board may determine.\"  Tex. \nCrim. Pro. Art. 42.18(2)(b) (1987).  The purpose of mandatory supervision is \"to aid all prisoners \nto readjust to society upon completion of their period of incarceration.\"  Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. \n42.18(1) (1987). \n23.  Parolees on mandatory supervision at TCCC are allowed to search for ajob in the \ncommunity and to leave the facility to work when they have secured employment.  The parolees \nthen return to the facility at night.  Eventually, mandatory supervision releasees are allowed to \nlive  in the  community  when they  can  formulate  a \"residence  plan\"  that  conforms to  their \nconditions of mandatory supervision.  If Mr. Meza were able to obtain employment, he would \nthen have the resources necessary to develop a \"residence plan\" to live outside the jail, like other \nmandatory supervision releasees. \n24.  Defendants have not allowed Plaintiff the same opportunities as other parolees. \nThey have placed him on \"lock down\"  status since his arrival at TCCC in 2002, and have \nconfmed him in the jail most of the time.  Other parolees are not on perpetual \"lock down\" status \nand  may  leave  the jail with  considerably  greater  freedom.  Other parolees  are  allowed  to \nformulate a weekly schedule of activities outside of the jail, such as doctors' appointments, job \ninterviews, visits to the Department of Public Safety to obtain driver's licenses, etc.  Mr. Meza is \nroutinely denied these same opportunities. \n25.  Mr. Meza has made numerous good faith attempts to secure employment, but \nDefendants have thwarted him.  Since about June of 2004, Defendants have allowed Plaintiff \nonly  five  hours  per week of time  at Project RIO  (Reintegration of Offenders), the  parolee \nemployment search program.  They allow other parolees virtually unlimited time at Project RIO. \nPrior to June 2004, Defendants did not allow Mr. Meza any access to these resources, even \nthough his conditions of parole explicitly require him to \"actively seek employment.\" \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 5 of 10\n26.  Before Mr. Meza can interview for a job, employment opportunities must be \nscreened by Defendants to ensure potential employment locations meet the conditions of his \nmandatory supervision.  Defendants habitually delay in screening the potential employers that \nPlaintiff has  located,  causing the  identified positions  to  be  filled  before  Mr.  Meza has the \nopportunity to interview for them.  Other parolees do not experience these chronic delays in their \njob searches. \n27.  On the rare occasion when Mr. Meza is able to secure a job interview, several \narmed guards accompany him to the interview.  On or about November 3, 2004, Mr. Meza had a \njob interview with Southern Education, and armed guards escorted him there.  Unsurprisingly, \nPlaintiff was  unable  to  secure  employment  under  these  conditions.  Armed  guards  do  not \naccompany other mandatory supervision releasees to job interviews. \n28.  Defendants have also told Mr. Meza that, should he find a job, an armed parole \nofficer will have to go to the job site with him every day.  The Board has made this requirement \na condition of Mr. Meza's mandatory supervision.  Potential employers have told Mr. Meza they \ncannot hire him for this reason.  Other parolees do not face this additional obstacle. \n29.  On August 21,2006, Mr. Meza had ajob interview for a construction position with \nMissions of Hope Ministries.  Missions of Hope Ministries offered Mr. Meza the position the \nnext  day.  TDCJ,  Collier  and  the  Board,  however,  intentionally  delayed  approving  this \nemployment opportunity until the position was no longer available. \n30.  Before Mr. Meza can accept any job opportunity, the offer of employment must be \nscreened by TDCJ's investigators, and then approved by the Board.  No other parolee is required \nto have his job opportunities approved by the Board.  No condition of Mr. Meza's release states \nthat job opportunities will have to be approved by the Board. \n31.  Because Defendants' actions have prevented him from securing ajob, Mr. Meza's \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 6 of 10\nliberty is considerably more restricted than other parolees on mandatory supervision at ICCC. \nDefendants allow other parolees to leave the facility and work in the community. \n32.  Mr. Meza has been denied educational opportunities that are offered to other \nparolees at ICCC, even though his conditions of parole require him to \"attend educational and \nvocational training classes.\"  Mr.  Meza has not been allowed to attend computer orientation \nclasses, job search classes and resume writing classes offered to other parolees at ICCC.  Mr. \nMeza has only been allowed to attend three one-day seminars offered at Project RIO, and even \nthen has been pulled out of the classes in the middle of the seminars because he is only allowed \ntwo and a half hours twice a week at Project RIO. \n33.  Denying Mr. Meza these educational opportunities also has negatively impacted \nhis job search and thus unduly restrained his liberty.  For example, in order to take full advantage \nof the limited amount of time he has access to Project RIO, Mr. Meza needs effective computer \nskills.  Due to his long incarceration and Defendants' refusal to allow him the same educational \nopportunities they offer other parolees, Plaintiff has been unable to develop these necessary skills \nalong with other parolees. \n34.  Mr. Meza has not been allowed to obtain a driver's license, a privilege allowed to \nother parolees at ICCC.  Indeed, Mr. Meza's conditions of parole imply he should be allowed to \nobtain a driver's license, as the conditions explicitly require him to \"obey driving restrictions,\" \n\"obtain and  keep  in  [his]  possession a Iexas Department of Public  Safety (DPS)  Personal \nIdentification Card or Driver's License,\" and \"leave all keys to any motor vehicle that [he has] \nuse of with facility staff\"  of any half-way house he may be allowed to reside at.  Without a \ndriver's license, certain employment opportunities are unavailable to Mr.  Meza (such as auto \nrepair positions).  Mr. Meza has been denied employment by auto repair facilities because he \ndoes not have a driver's license. \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 7 of 10\n35.  Defendants have not afforded Mr. Meza any due process of law to justify his \ndisparate treatment at TCCC.  No conditions of Plaintiffs mandatory supervision justify this \ndisparate treatment. \n36.  The conditions imposed on Mr. Meza's mandatory supervision by the Board are \nirrational, arbitrary and capricious.  For example, Mr. Meza is required to wear an electronic \nglobal positioning tracking monitor at all times.  The monitor informs Defendants of Mr. Meza's \nlocation at all times.  Mr. Meza is also not allowed to leave TCCC without being accompanied \nby a parole officer, despite the electronic monitor.  These conditions are intentionally redundant \nand thus arbitrary and capricious.  These conditions were imposed without due process of law, \nand have an intentionally discriminatory purpose.  Only two other parolees in the state have \nconditions as onerous as those imposed on Mr. Meza.  The cumulative effect of these conditions \ncreates a substantial restraint on Mr. Meza's liberty, and is a significant, atypical hardship. \n37.  The Parole Division, at Collier's direction, intentionally refuses to provide Mr. \nMeza with a parole officer to accompany him so that he may leave the jaiL  This creates a de \nfacto qualitative restriction on Mr. Meza's liberty, which has been imposed without due process \noflaw. \n38.  On February 23, 2005, Mr. Meza received a notice informing him the Board was \nreimposing sex offender conditions on his parole, and that he had one month to respond.  Mr. \nMeza promptly filed a response.  This notice was never served on his attorneys, who TDCJ and \nthe Board knew represented him, in violation of Rule 4.02(a) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.  (Three members of the Board, Aliseda, Aycock and Garcia, are attorneys \nlicensed in the State of Texas who are required to comply with the Texas Disciplinary Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.) \n39.  TDCJ and the Board ignored Mr. Meza's response, and imposed sex offender \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 8 of 10\nconditions  on his  parole without affording  him  due  process,  in violation of the  holding  of \nColeman  v.  Dretke,  395  FJd 216  (5th Cir.  2004).  Mr.  Meza's attorneys  contacted  TDCJ \nregarding this abuse of due process, and were ignored.  The sex offender conditions remain \nimposed on Mr. Meza's parole. \nCAUSE OF ACTION - DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION \n40.  The TDCJ Defendants and the Board impose qualitatively different conditions of \nconfinement upon Mr. Meza than other similarly situated parolees.  The informal imposition of \nthese additional conditions upon Mr. Meza alone violates his due process rights. \n41.  The TDCJ Defendants enforce additional informal restrictions on Mr. Meza's \nliberty that have  not been justified by  due  process and  are  not provided for  in any  of his \nconditions of parole.  They habitually and intentionally treat Mr. Meza differently from other \nsimilarly situated parolees on mandatory supervision so as to deny Mr. Meza the opportunities \nafforded to others. \n42.  The Board has imposed sex offender conditions on Mr. Meza's parole without \nproviding him due process, in violation of law and his Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n43.  The Board has imposed irrational, arbitrary and capricious conditions on Mr. \nMeza's mandatory supervision without affording him due process of law.  These conditions are \nqualitatively different than the conditions imposed on other parolees released after completion of \ntheir sentences for similar convictions. \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n44.  Mr. Meza seeks declaratory judgment to vindicate his rights under Section 1983 \nwith respect to Defendants' violations of his due process rights. \n45.  Mr. Meza is entitled to declaratory judgment concerning Defendants' violations of \nhis due process rights. \n8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 311   Filed 10/30/08   Page 9 of 10\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n46.  Mr. Meza seeks injunctive relief, permanently enjoining Defendants from: \na.  Continuing  to  subject  Mr.  Meza  to  qualitatively  different  conditions  of \nconfinement without due process of law; and, \nb.  Imposing sex offender conditions upon his parole without due process of law. \n47.  Inasmuch as Defendants have acted in the events described herein, they will \ncontinue to act accordingly.  Without injunctive relief, Defendants will continue their outrageous \nconduct, thereby unduly limiting Mr. Meza's liberty without due process. \nATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS \n48.  Mr. Meza is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation costs, and court costs, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Mr. Meza respectfully prays that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Issue declaratory relief that Defendants' conduct constituted illegal deprivation of \nPlaintiff's due process rights; \nB.  Grant reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and court costs; and \nC.  Grant all other and additional relief to which Mr. Meza may be entitled, at law or \nin equity. \nDATED: lmroยท  200g.,\"t \nj, \noJAte.:r~ \nRespectfully Submitted, \nJames C.

On February 20, 2007, the Court conducted a hearing on the parties' \nmotions at which all parties were represented by counsel.  Having considered the motions, the \nsupplemental briefing, the case file, the oral arguments of counsel, and the applicable law, the Court \nwill deny Livingston and Collier's motion to quash or for protective order in part and grant in part, \nand will grant Meza's motion to compel Orion to produce the subpoenaed documents in part by \nordering Orion to produce the documents for in camera inspection. \nOn December 6, 2006, counsel for Meza served Orion Treatment Center (\"Orion\") with a \nsubpoena commanding Orion to produce and permit inspection and copying of Meza's complete \npatient file.  Orion was under contract with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\"TDCJ\") \nbetween December 1,2000, and February 28,2006, to provide sexwoffender treatment to parolees \nresiding at the Travis County Corrections Center.  The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (\"the \nParole Board\") determined by majority vote on September 24, 2002, that Meza was required to \nreceive sex-offender treatment.  Following the Parole Board's decision, the TDCJ contracted with \nOrion to provide the mandated sex-offender treatment to Meza, which Meza subsequently attended. \nOrion remains in possession of Meza's patient file from his treatment period at Orion, although \ncopies of some documents in Orion's file were delivered to the Parole Board and are being kept by \nTDCJ-Parole Division in Meza's parole file.  Meza contends that the records in Orion's possession \nare  relevant because  the  records  were  relied  on  by  Defendants to  determine  Meza's parole \nconditions, the legality of which form the basis of Meza' s lawsuit. \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 131   Filed 04/12/07   Page 3 of 8\nLivingston and Collier move to quash the subpoena, or in the alternative, for the Court to \nconduct an in camera inspection of the subpoenaed documents.  In the event the Court denies their \nmotion, Livingston and Collier ask this Court to render a protective order prohibiting Meza' s counsel \nfrom disclosing any part of the patient file to Meza. Livingston and Collier contend that the patient \nfile is part of Meza's parole file and is therefore protected under the state-law privilege protecting \ninformation relating to a parolee. See Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. ยง 5080313 (West 2004). Meza opposes \nLivingston and Collier's motion and moves this Court to compel Orion to produce the requested \npatient file. \nPrivileged Matters in the Federal Rules \nGenerally, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that \"[p ]arties may obtain discovery \nregarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party ....\"  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 26(b).  \"When considering a federal claim, federal courts apply federal common law, \nrather than state law, to determine the existence and scope of a privilege.\" Coughlin v. Lee, 946 F.2d \n1152,1159 (5th Cir. 1991); see also Gilbreath v. Guadalupe Hasp. Found, Inc., 5 Fo3d 785 (5th Cir. \n1993) (party is \"seeking to enforce subpoenas issued under federal statutory authority .... [The] \nright to assert a privilege is therefore dictated by federal law\"); United States v. Moore, 970 F.2d 48, \n49-50 (5th Cir. 1992).  The term \"privilege,\" protecting entities from discovery under the rules of \nprocedure, \"refers to 'privileges' as that term is understood in the law of evidence.\"  United States \nv. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1,6 (1953). The law of evidence calls for the federal court to apply privileges \naccording to \"the principles of the common law ... in the light of reason and experience.\" Fed. R. \nEvid.501.  A federal court, in determining whether to introduce a privilege from state law into a \nfederal proceeding, considers whether the privilege \"promotes sufficiently important interests to \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 131   Filed 04/12/07   Page 4 of 8\noutweigh the need for probative evidence ... [guided by] [b loth 'reason and experience. '\" Jaffee v. \nRedmond, 518 U.S. 1,9-10 (1996). \nLivingston and Collier ask for this Court to recognize a federal privilege under Rule 501 that \nprotects parole files from discovery.  Before determining whether to recognize a federal privilege \nfor parole files, however, the Court will consider whether Texas's statutory privilege would apply \nto the documents sought in this case from Orion. \nLivingston and Collier's Standing \nMeza argues that Livingston and Collier do not have standing to move this Court to quash \nthe subpoena served on Orion, a third party.  A party does not have standing to raise the issue of a \nthird-party's amenability to a subpoena if the party is \"not in the possession of the materials \nsubpoenaed and [has] not alleged any personal right or privilege with respect to the materials \nsubpoenaed.\"  Brown v.  Braddick, 595 F.2d 961, 967 (5th Cir. 1979).  \"The case law on what \nconstitutes a 'personal right or privilege' is scarce; the courts that have considered the issue have \ngenerally found standing when the party had an evidentiary privilege as to the documents.\"  Jez v. \nDow Chern.  Co., 402 F. Supp. 2d 783, 785 (S.D. Tex. 2005).  As Livingston and Collier have \nclaimed a privilege regarding the subpoenaed documents, the question of their standing to move to \nquash the subpoenas appears to converge with the question of whether or not such a privilege applies \nto the patient file requested from Orion.  The Court will therefore consider whether the state-law \nstatutory privilege protecting parole files applies to the patient file that Meza seeks from Orion. \nTexas's Statutory Parole-File Privilege \nUnder Texas law, \"[a]ny party who seeks to deny the production of evidence must claim a \nspecific privilege against such production.\"  In re Union Pac. Resources Co., 22 S.W.3d 338,340 \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 131   Filed 04/12/07   Page 5 of 8\n(1999).  Only those privileges prescribed under the Rules of Evidence, the constitution, a statute, or \nby other rules pursuant to statutory authority are recognized under Texas law.  Tex. R. Evid. 501. \nThe privilege relied on by  Livingston and  Collier is  contained in Chapter 58  of the  Texas \nGovernment Code and provides: \n[a]11 information obtained and maintained, including a victim protest \nletter or other correspondence, a victim impact statement, a list of \ninmates eligible for release on parole, and an arrest record of an \ninmate, is confidential and privileged if the information relates to \n... a releasee .... \nTex. Gov'tCodeAnn. ยง 508.313(a). A releasee includes a person released on parole. Id. at 508.001. \nMeza argues that this privilege does not apply to the patient file held by Orion because it is \n\"obtained and maintained\" by Orion, while section 508.313 is directed only to the \"machinations of \nthe Parole Board.\"!  This Court agrees that the file held by Orion is not necessarily protected by \nTexas's statutory privilege. The mere fact that Orion has turned some of Meza' s records over to the \nTDCJ for inclusion in Meza's parole file may not justify application of the statutory privilege to a \nrequest of the records from Orion itself.  However, Texas law is sketchy here. One Texas court has \nrejected the contention that a document requested from a source other than the parole file, \"by virtue \nof [also] being in the parole file[,] takes on the sanctity of the parole file itself,\" reasoning that \n[c ]arried to its logical extreme, appellant's argument would preclude \nthe introduction of any evidence obtained from any source just by the \nfortuitous circumstance of it also appearing in the defendant's parole \nfile.  We do not believe that this was the intent of the confidentiality \n!  The Court presumes that Meza refers to TDCJ rather than the Parole Board in making this \nargument. Although the statute is not clear as to what entity \"obtain [s ] and maintain[ s]\" information \nprotected in section 508.313, TDCJ is the only entity referenced in the section.  See Tex. Gov't Code \nAnn. ยง 508.313(c); see also id. at ยง 491.001 (defining \"department\" as TDCJ throughout Title 2, \nSubtitle G of Texas Government Code). \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 131   Filed 04/12/07   Page 6 of 8\nprovisions of [Section 508313f [Section 508.313] was enacted to \nencourage frank and candid disclosures in the parolee's file. . . . It in \nno way implies that information obtained from a different source \nshould be made confidential by its inclusion in the file. \nWilburn v. State, 636 S.W.2d 771, 777 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 1982, no writ).  In the present \ncase, TDC} contracted with Orion to provide treatment to Meza.  The contract between TDC} and \nOrion includes a provision prohibiting a third party's access to records without written authorization \nfrom the Director of Specialized Programs at TDC}, but grants the TDCJ unlimited access to the \nrecords.  The fact that portions of Orion's patient file on Meza are also included in Meza's parole \nfile is therefore more than \"fortuitous.\"  Livingston and Collier, however, provide no support for \ntheir contention that the statutory privilege was intended to be construed so broadly to prevent \ndocument production from an entity other than the TDCJ itself. \nAlthough Livingston and Collier contend that it is not in the public interest to reveal to a \npatient who is also a parolee the notes a counselor has written about him in his treatment file, the \nTexas Legislature has enacted no statute declaring such records privileged in the hands of a treatment \ncenter, thus denying the patient files to the patient himself.  This Court is not convinced that the \nSection 508.313 is so broad in its scope as to reach records beyond those held by TDC}. \nFurthermore, the Texas courts have noted that the privilege protecting parole files at times \nconflicts with \"fundamental principles of due process of law in the fair administration of justice.\" \nTexas Dep't ojCorrections v.  Dalehite, 623 S.W.2d 420,424 (Tex. Crim. App. 1981).  In those \nPrior to 1985, the Texas statute concerning the parole-file privilege was codified at article 42.12 \n2 \nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. From 1985 to 1997, the provision was found in article 42.18 of \nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.  In a nonsubstantive act effective September 1, 1997, the Texas \nLegislature repealed article 42.18 and relocated the provision to section 508313 of the Texas \nGovernment  Code.  The  provision  has  remained  substantially  unchanged  regarding  the \nconfidentiality of parole files, and the case law cited in this Order interpreting the earlier provisions \nis equally applicable, despite the later amendments to the provision. \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 131   Filed 04/12/07   Page 7 of 8\nsituations, the \"determination of what will or will not be made available to either party from the \nparole records [is placed] within the discretion of the trial court.\" The presumption in favor of \nupholding the parole-file privilege can be rebutted if there is \"demonstration of the need and \nrelevancy of the requested documents.\"  Id at 423. \nMeza contends that the contents of his patient file will dispute Livingston and Collier's \ncontention that Meza's parole conditions are justified because Meza is a continuing threat to the \ncommunity.  Meza has also alleged that Collier \"personally communicated with Mr. Meza's sex \noffender counselors employed by Orion in furtherance of the campaign to deny Mr. Meza release \nfrom TCCC.\"  Livingston and Collier admit that portions of the patient file were admitted to the \nParole Board to be considered in determining the conditions to be imposed on Meza during his \nparole. Meza's claims are based on the \"qualitatively different conditions of confinement\" imposed \non him by Defendants  from  other parolees  similarly situated.  Accordingly, the  information \nconsidered by Defendants in determining Meza's conditions of parole is likely relevant to whether \nDefendants are imposing conditions that are \"irrational, arbitrary, and capricious,\" as Meza claims. \nThe  state-law privilege may not apply to information concerning Meza in whomever's \nhands, to the extent that it is relevant and necessary to adjudication of Meza' s claims.  Meza has \ndemonstrated  that  information  maintained  by  Orion may  prove  relevant  in  adjudicating  his \nconstitutional due-process claims.  The Court will order in camera inspection of the subpoenaed \ndocuments  to  determine  their  relevance  and  necessity  before  determining  whether  to  order \nproduction of the subpoenaed documents.  See Dalehite, 623 S.W.2d at 423; Texas Bd o/Pardons \n& Paroles v. Miller, 590 S.W.2d 142, 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979). This Court will therefore grant \nLivingston and Collier's motion as to their request for the Court to conduct an in camera review of \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 131   Filed 04/12/07   Page 8 of 8\nthe subpoenaed documents, will deny Livingston and Collier's motion in all other respects, and will \ngrant in part Meza's motion to compel Orion to produce the subpoenaed documents. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants Livingston and Collier's Motion to \nQuash or for Protective Order (Clerk's Document 53) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN \nPART and  Plaintiffs motion to compel (Clerk's Document 56) is GRANTED IN PART AND \nDENIED IN PART to the following extent: \nIT IS ORDERED that Orion Treatment Center shall deliver to the Chambers of United \nStates District Judge Lee Yeakel, Second Floor of the United States Courthouse, 200 West 8th \nStreet, Austin, Texas, on or before April 27, 2007, the complete patient file of Raul Meza, Jr., to \nthe extent that such documents are in the possession or under the control of Orion Treatment Center. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court shall mail a copy of this Order \nto Orion Treatment Center, 3625 Manchaca Road, Austin, Texas, 78704, and the United States \nMarshals Service, in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.1, shall effect service of this \nOrder on Orion Treatment Center, 3625 Manchaca Road, Austin, Texas, 78704. \n/lth \nSIGNED this  day of April, 2007. \n8 ",

On \nMarch 29,2011, the Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs motion.  All parties appeared by and were \nrepresented by counsel.  Having reviewed the motion, response, reply, as well as all evidence and \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 435   Filed 03/30/11   Page 2 of 4\nbriefing submitted by the parties, and the arguments of counsel at the hearing, the Court determines \nthat Plaintiff s motion should be granted in part as to Plaintiff s request for enforcement ofj udgment. \nInsofar as Plaintiff moves for contempt against the Board Defendants, the motion remains pending \nbefore the Court. \nOn March 24,2009, this Court ordered the Board to provide Plaintiff Raul Meza a hearing \nwith the following due process protections:  (l) written notice in advance  of the hearing; (2) \ndisclosure of the evidence on which the State is relying; (3) a hearing, scheduled sufficiently after \nthe notice to permit Meza to prepare, at which he will have the opportunity to be heard in person, \nrepresented by counsel, and to present documentary evidence in his support; (4) an opportunity at \nthe hearing to call witnesses and confront and cross examine state witnesses, 'except upon a finding, \nnot arbitrarily made, of good cause for not permitting each as to a particular witness'; (5) an \nindependent decision maker; and, at issue here, (6) a written statement by the fact-finder as to the \nevidence relied upon and the reasons for the decision.  Specifically, the Court found the record in \nthis case was utterly devoid of findings regarding Meza and rejected the Board's argument that the \ncontinued imposition of sex -offender conditions constituted a sufficient finding that Meza possessed \nthe offensive characteristic oflack of sexual control for the basis for such finding. On May 20, 2010, \nthe Fifth Circuit affirmed these findings and conclusions, only disagreeing with this Court's finding \nthat the State is required to provide counsel to Meza. \nBy his motion, Meza contends that after the Fifth Circuit's ruling, a hearing was conducted \nby the Board on June 4, 2010. On June 25, 2010, the panel voted unanimously in a one-page notice \nto continue Meza's sex-offender conditions.  The findings were a single sentence: \"Raul Meza \nconstitutes a threat to society by reason of his lack of sexual control.\"  On August 20, 2010, Meza \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 435   Filed 03/30/11   Page 3 of 4\nfiled a motion for reconsideration with the Board and requested the Board provide the required \nwritten statement by the fact-finder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the decision. \nTo date, argues Meza, the Board has still not provided this required written statement.  Meza asks \nthe Court to appoint a third party to review the record of the hearing, make the required findings, and \nauthor the required written statement at the Board's expense. Meza also requests that the Court find \nthe Board in contempt, levy a fine against each of the Board Defendants, and award Meza attorney's \nfees and costs associated with the preparation of this motion. \nThe Board responds that they have provided the required written statement. The Board refers \nthe Court to the same one-page document as Meza which finds that Meza \"constitutes a threat to \nsociety by reason of his lack of sexual control\" and lists witnesses who testified and documents \nadmitted at the hearing as evidence relied upon.  The Board contends that neither the Government \nCode nor the Code of Criminal Procedure requires findings of fact and that a list of evidence \npresented is sufficient and that requiring specific findings \"would have the potential to unnecessarily \noverburden the Board process by extending such a requirement to all parole-related decisions.\" \nHaving reviewed the motion, response, reply, as well as all evidence and briefing submitted \nby the parties, and the arguments of counsel at the hearing, the Court finds that the Board decision \nof June 25, 2010 does not comply with this Court's Order of March 24,2009, as affirmed by the \nCourt of Appeals.  The Board's decision is not a \"written statement by the fact-finder as to the \nevidence relied upon and the reasons for the decision\" in that it contains neither reasons for the \ndecision nor evidence relied upon.  To be in compliance, the written statement must contain with \nspecificity the evidence presented to the Board that was persuasive to the Board in its decision and \nthe specific reasons for the decision. \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 435   Filed 03/30/11   Page 4 of 4\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs Motion for Enforcement of Judgment \nand Contempt Against Defendants Owen, Aliseda, Aycock, Davis, Denoyelles, Lorraine, and \nGonzales (Clerk's Document No. 413) is GRANTED insofar as the Board is ORDERED to \nprepare a new written statement on or before April 29, 2011 that sets out with specificity \nthe evidence relied upon and the reasons for its decision to continue Meza's sex-offender \nconditions.

We are intimately familiar \nwith the trial record in this case and the strenuous defense mounted by the \ndefendants at every turn.  The record fully supports the fee arrived at by the \ndistrict court.  We also find no merit to defendants' specific objections. \nโข Pursuant to 5TH GIR.

By his motion, Meza requests that this Court exclude \nthe testimony of Defendants Livingston and Collier's expert witnesses pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 37( c). In the alternative, Meza requests that this Court order Livingston and Collier \nto produce a written report prepared and signed by each expert witness designated by Livingston and \nCollier pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B). \nLivingston and Collier's response to Meza's motion was due on May 1, 2007. See W.D. Tex. \nLocal R. CV -7( d) (requiring party opposed to motion to respond within eleven days of service of \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 164   Filed 05/04/07   Page 2 of 2\nmotion and allowing district court to grant motion as unopposed if no timely response is filed).  To \ndate, however, Livingston and Collier have filed no response to Meza's motion.  Thus, pursuant to \nLocal Rule CV-7(d), Meza's motion may be granted as unopposed.

Plaintiff Raul Meza \nMeza originally sued Bryan Collier, the former Director of the Texas Department of Criminal \n1 \nJustice Parole Division.  The Court granted Defendants Brad Livingston and Collier's motion to \nsubstitute Stuart Jenkins for Collier on November 10,2008 (Clerk's Document 334). \n2 Meza originally sued Linda Garcia, in her official capacity as a member of the Texas Board of \nPardons and Paroles. The Court granted the Board members' motion to substitute Barbara Lorraine \nfor Garcia on November 10,2008 (Clerk's Document 334). \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 2 of 26\nappeared in person and by counsel. Defendants Brad Livingston, as Executive Director ofthe Texas \nDepartment of Criminal Justice, and Stuart Jenkins, as Director of the Texas Department of Criminal \nJustice-Parole Division (collectively, the \"Department\") appeared by counsel.  Defendants Rissie \nL. Owens, Jose Aliseda, Charles Aycock, Conrith Davis, Jackie DeNoyelles, Barbara Lorraine, and \nJuanita M. Gonzales, as members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (collectively, the \n\"Board\") appeared by counsel. Meza contends, inter alia, that Defendants denied him the process \nhe was due when they imposed and enforced sex-offender conditions as part of his mandatory \nsupervision  following  his  term  of  incarceration  in  the  Texas  Department  of  Criminal \nJustice-Correctional Institutions Division.  Having carefully considered the evidence presented at \ntrial, the parties' stipulated facts, the applicable law, the arguments of counsel, and the record in this \ncause, the Court finds and concludes that the procedural protections afforded to Meza pursuant to \nColeman v. Dretke were insufficient, and will grant Meza's request for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to the extent that the State of Texas must afford Meza due process as required by Coleman. \nSee 395 FJd 216 (5th Cir. 2004). In so deciding, the Court makes the following findings offact and \nconclusions of law.3 \nJurisdiction and Venue \nThe Court has jurisdiction, as Meza's claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.  See 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343 (2006).  The Court has authority to grant Plaintiffs \nclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief. See 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201-2202 (2006); Fed. R. Civ. P. 57, \n65.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin \nAll findings offact contained herein that are more appropriately considered conclusions oflaw are \n3 \nto be so deemed.  Likewise, any conclusion of law more appropriately considered a finding of fact \nshall be so deemed. \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 3 of 26\nDivision, because all events and omissions complained of occurred within this district.  See 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1391(b) (2006). \nBackgrountf \nOn March 8, 1982, Meza pleaded guilty under Texas law to the murder of nine-year-old \nKendra Page and admitted to sexually assaulting Page during the course of the murder.  Meza was \nsentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder.  On September 8, 1989, Meza was sentenced \nto four years additional imprisonment, to be served consecutively to his 30-year term, for possession \nofa deadly weapon in a penal institution.  Meza's sentence currently will expire January 24,2017. \nAt the time of Meza's conviction, Texas law provided that a person convicted of a crime \nmust be released from prison on mandatory supervision when the length of the prisoner's calendar \ntime in prison plus good-conduct time the prisoner earned while in prison equaled the total length \nof the sentence imposed on the prisoner.5  See Act of May 29, 1977, 65th Leg., R.S., ch. 347, ยง 1, \nart. 42.12, sec. 15(c), 1965 Tex.

For simplicity, the Court omits \"on or about.\" \n5 The mandatory-supervision law was amended in 1995 to be discretionary.  See Act of May 29, \n1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ยง 5, art. 42.18, sec. 2(c-l), 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 2592, 2592-93 (current \nversion at Tex. Govt.

The purpose of mandatory supervision is \"to aid all prisoners to \nreadjust to society upon completion oftheir period of incarceration ....\"  See Act of May 29, 1977, \n65th Leg., R.S., ch. 347, ยง 1, art. 42.12, sec. 1, 1965 Tex.

Dretke, 395 F.3d 216 (Sth Cir. 2004), the court of appeals simplified the terms used \nin the Texas Government Code: \"[b ]ecause the distinction between mandatory supervision and \nparole is not highly relevant to the issues at hand we will use the simpler term 'parole' for the \nremainder of this opinion.\"  Coleman, 39S FJd at 219, n.l; see also Tex. Govt. Code Ann. ยง \nS08.147 (\"An inmate released to mandatory supervision is considered to be released on parole.\"). \nThis Court will do the same and also use the more familiar term \"parolee\" instead of \"releasee.\" See \nColeman, 395 F.3d at 219, n.1.  As used in this opinion the term \"parolee\" includes a releasee on \neither parole or mandatory supervision. \n7T  he Board and Department attempt to distinguish their responsibilities, and indeed, the agencies \nperform separate functions.  However, the Department and the Board are Texas state agencies that \nwork closely together. In the final analysis, Meza's conditions are imposed and implemented by the \nState of Texas.  The Court considers all ofMeza's allegations to be against the state.  Thus, despite \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 5 of 26\nOn May 19, 1993, after serving 11 years of his sentence, Meza was released from custody \nand placed on parole as required by existing law.  While on parole, Meza lived a relatively normal \nlife within the community.  On August 24, 1994, Meza violated the conditions of his parole by \nreturning to his residence  15 minutes after his state-imposed curfew.  The  State conducted a \nrevocation hearing on September 16,  1994, revoked Meza's parole on October 21,  1994, and \nincarcerated him again until September 25,2002. \nThe State was required to release Meza from prison on September 25,2002. See Act of May \n29,1977, 65th Leg., R.S., ch. 347, ยง 1, art. 42.12, sec. 15(c), 1965 Tex. Gen. Laws 925,927-28. The \nState again set Meza's parole conditions, which are more restrictive than those in 1993 due to \nchanges in state law.  Some of Meza' s conditions are statutorily required, while some are \"special \nconditions\" imposed by the Board. See Tex. Govt. Code Ann. ยงยง 508.l81-.191, .221-.226. Meza's \ncurrent special conditions include the Super Intensive Supervision Program condition (\"SISP\"); \nSpecial Condition 0.06, regarding child-safety zones; Special Condition X, containing sex-offender \nconditions; and Special Condition 0.99, which prohibits Meza from leaving the Travis County \nCorrectional Complex (\"TCCC\"), where he is housed, without a supervising parole officer.s Some \nofMeza's special conditions contain overlapping components.9 \ntheir different responsibilities, the Court will refer throughout this opinion to the Board and the \nDepartment as the \"State,\" unless it is important to refer to either specifically. \nSpecial Condition 0.99 is a \"free text\" special condition, meaning a Board panel may use it to \n8 \nimpose any type of condition on a parolee.  Parolees may have more than one condition 0.99, and \nvery few parolees have a special condition 0 .99 like Meza' s. Meza is the only parolee at TCCC with \nthe parole-officer-supervision condition. Mike Lozito, Parole Division Region IV Director, testified \nthat one parolee in San Antonio has such a condition. \nBoard Administrator Troy Fox testified that the Board purposely overlaps certain conditions such \n9 \nas Meza's stand-alone Special Condition 0.99, requiring a parole-officer escort, and SISP, so that \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 6 of 26\nMeza's SISP condition includes the requirements that he reside in a community residential \nfacility, or \"halfway house,\" designated by the Department; comply with all facility rules and \nregulations in effect during his period of residence; attend educational and vocational training classes \nas directed by his parole officer; not go within 500 feet of places children commonly gather (child-\nsafety-zone component); and wear an electronic-monitoring device at all times.lo Special Condition \nX requires that Meza participate in a sex-offe nder-treatment program, be evaluated to determine the \nneed for sex-offender counseling, enroll and participate in a treatment program for sex offenders as \ndirected by his supervising parole officer, submit to polygraph examinations, avoid child-safety \nzones, wear an electronic-monitoring device, and otherwise comply with sex -offender conditions.ll \nSpecial Condition 0.06 also prohibits Meza from entering child-safety zones. \nImmediately upon his release from State custody in 2002, Meza was placed in the physical \ncustody of Travis County, Texas. Since then Meza has resided at TCCC, a Travis County jail facility \nin Del Valle, Texas, with which the State contracts to house parolees.  While Meza is physically \nhoused at TCCC, the Department retains control over his movements.  Meza resides in a bay of \nTCCC's work-release section with other parolees, surrounded by a razor-wire fence. Meza testified \nthere will be a backup in case the State ever withdraws SISP as a condition. \nIn Meza's November 13,2003 parole certificate, his SISP condition included a sex-offender \n10 \nregistration component. The certificate also imposed Special Condition M, requiring him to register \nas a sex offender.  However, Meza's July 19, 2005 Notice of Special Conditions omits Special \nCondition M and other sex -offender-registration components. At trial, State witnesses testified that \nMeza no longer has sex-offe nder-registration conditions on his parole. \nIn Meza's July 19,2005 Notice of Special Conditions, Special Condition X requires both that \n11 \nMeza \"participate in the Sex Offender Treatment Program,\" and \"enroll and participate in a \ntreatment program for sex offenders as directed by the supervising parole officer.\" The distinction \nbetween these components, if there is one, is not clear from the record. \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 7 of 26\nthat other bays in the work-release section house prison inmates, he has been in such bays, and they \nare identical to the bay in which he is housed.  Meza must comply with Teee rules, such as going \nto bed at 10:30 p.m. and rising at 5:00 a.m.  When Meza leaves his residence bay, he must wear a \njail uniform.  Family may visit once a week, and visits are conducted through a glass partition by \ntelephone.  A Teee resident may have one contact visit each month, at which he may hold hands \nwith his guest.  Meza's parole officer provides his daily schedule.  When the Department allows \nMeza to leave the jail, it transports him in a cargo van equipped with an interior steel cage.  The \nState throughout the trial argued Meza's living conditions do not amount to confinement; the eourt \nis unpersuaded. \nMeza's parole conditions require that he reside at Teee for the first 180 days of his parole. \nTo leave Teee and reside elsewhere, Meza's parole conditions require that he form a viable \nresidence plan.  To form/a viable residence plan, Meza must demonstrate that he has the income to \nlive elsewhere.  To obtain income, he must secure employment.  However, the restrictiveness of \nMeza's parole conditions have prevented him from securing employment.  The ISO-day initial \nresidency period has long since expired, but Meza remains in Teee.  Theoretically, Meza's \nconditions do not prevent him from living in the community, attending church, visiting his family, \nor obtaining employment, but practically, his conditions prohibit him from leaving Teee, a jail. \nFew other parolees have conditions of release as restrictive as Meza's.  Meza cannot go \nwithin 500 feet of places children commonly gather, including but not limited to, schools, day-care \nfacilities, playgrounds, public or private youth centers, public swimming pools, or video-arcade \nfacilities. Meza's child-safety-zone conditions prevent him from living with his mother, because she \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 8 of 26\noccasionally cares for children in her home.  Meza's child-safety-zone conditions have also caused \nthe State to prevent Meza from accepting job offers he has received. \nMeza's  conditions  include  the  highest  level  of monitoring  and  supervision  and  the \nrequirement that he be escorted by a parole officer at all times.  Special Condition 0.99, the parole-\nofficer-supervision requirement, is especially restrictive,  because the Department controls the \navailability of parole officers. At trial, State witnesses could identify but one other parolee in Texas \nwith a comparable parole-officer-supervision condition.  The Department assigns a parole officer \nto escort Meza outside TCCC for only eight hours per week.  Between 2002 and 2005, Meza was \nallowed to leave TCCC only twice; once for a job interview and once to visit a hospital emergency \nroom. Meza must present any request to leave TCCC to his parole officer in writing, and currently, \nthe Department grants only his requests to leave for medical reasons. \nIn 2005, Meza began visiting Project RIO, or \"Reintegration of Offenders.\" At Project RIO, \nMeza may use computers to search for jobs, make collect calls from telephones, and participate in \njob-training and placement programs.  Meza has also participated in resume-writing classes at \nProject RIO.  Sometimes the Department denies his requests to take such classes.  Meza was \naccepted into the Construction Gateway program at Project RIO, which offers former offenders job-\ntraining opportunities.  Through Construction Gateway, Meza attended a seven-week construction \nclass at Austin Community College. \nThe Department provides a parole officer for Meza to attend Project RIO for only four hours \nper week, two hours each on Wednesday and Friday.  Meza testified that attending Project RIO two \n12 \nThe record reflects that the Department allots a parole-officer to accompany Meza for eight hours \n12 \nper week, but that he may spend only four hours per week at Project RIO.  It is unclear what occurs \nin the remaining four hours. Meza's parole conditions do not limit his time away from TCCC. The \n8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 9 of 26\ndays per week for two hours per day is insufficient to enable him to obtain employment, because he \ndoes not have time to follow up onjob leads. He is unable to pursue job leads from the jail, because \nhe has no money with which to make phone calls on the pay telephones, and prospective employers \nwill not accept collect calls from jail. \nSylvester Villarreal, the Program Coordinator at Construction Gateway, testified that for \nsomeone in Meza's position to secure employment, seeking employment should be a 40-hour-per \nweek endeavor.  Villarreal stated that, although Meza diligently searches for employment, his \nconditions have hindered his opportunities.  Villarreal explained that jobs are posted on Internet \ndatabases early in the week, and the best time for Project RIO attendees to search for employment \nis Sunday or early in the week.  Often jobs have been filled by Wednesday or Thursday.  Meza's \nDepartment-imposed schedule is problematic for Meza, because the Department only allows him to \nattend Project Rio on Wednesdays and Fridays. Further, the Department requires that Meza provide \nhis parole officer with information regarding his job leads.  He is the only Construction Gateway \n'participant who must provide this information.  Overall, despite Meza's job-search attempts at \nProject RIO and participation in the Construction Gateway program, his parole conditions have \nprevented him from securing employment. \nIn the years that he has attended Project RIO, Meza has submitted many job prospects to his \nparole officer for review and approval. Meza's parole officer must communicate up the Department \nchain of command regarding Meza's opportunities. Usually Meza's parole officer does not inform \nMeza of the results after inquiring with employers about the possibility ofMeza working for them. \n13 \nconditions do require that he be accompanied by a parole officer when away from TCCC. \nDuring Meza's time at TCCC he has had between 12 and 15 parole officers. \n13 \n9 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 10 of 26\nThe record reflects confusion and delays as inquiries regarding Meza's opportunities make their way \nthrough the Department. For example, in April 2007 , Meza was offered a construction-industry job \nthat required that Meza undergo a urinalysis as part of the hiring process.  The Department denied \nMeza's request to have the urinalysis performed.  When Meza's attorney complained, no one \nresponded.  Mike Lozito, Parole Division Region IV Director, testified that he did not think the \ncomplaint needed a response.  He passed it to another state official and was uncertain what \nsubsequently occurred. Despite Lozito's lack of engagement with Meza' s job search process, Lozito \nfurther testified that he would \"love\" for Meza to find ajob. \nBesides the aforementioned construction job, Meza has received three offers of employment \nsince 2002.  One required that Meza have a driver's license, but at that time the Department would \nnot allow him to obtain such license.14  Meza was offered a clerical position on the tenth floor of a \ndowntown building, but the Department would not approve the position because a child-safety zone \nwas located across the street.  The last offer was a construction position, but the Department would \nnot approve it, because Meza would have had to cross a child-safety zone to reach the job site. \nMeza brought this action on December 5,  2005, alleging violations of his Fourteenth \nAmendment equal-protection and due-process rights.  See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 1.  It is \nundisputed that at all relevant times, Defendants were acting under color of law, pursuant to legal \nauthority, and in their official capacities. \nLozito testified that he would not allow Meza to obtain a driver's license when Meza requested \n14 \none, because Lozito did not see a point in Meza's having one.  Lozito denied that he imposed such \na \"condition\" on Meza, because he is not authorized to impose conditions. Meza has since obtained \na driver's license. \n10 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 11 of 26\nFourth Amended Complaint \nIn his Fourth Amended Complaint, Meza asserts that the Board violated his due-process \nrights by imposing sex-offender conditions and other irrational, arbitrary, and capricious conditions \non his parole.  See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 1; Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nโข \n(2006).  Meza asserts the Department and Board are violating his Fourteenth Amendment due-\nprocess rights by imposing conditions on his parole that are  qualitatively different from the \npunishment typically imposed on similarly situated parolees. See id.  Meza further alleges that the \nDepartment is violating his Fourteenth Amendment due-process and equal-protection rights by \nimposing additional informal, unauthorized conditions on his parole and habitually and intentionally \ntreating Meza differently from similarly situated parolees.  See id. \nMeza seeks an injunction preventing Defendants from imposing sex-offender conditions \nwithout due process and from continuing to subject him to qualitatively different conditions of \nconfinement without due process.  He also seeks a declaratory judgment that Defendants' conduct \nconstitutes illegal deprivation of his due-process rights. Meza finally seeks attorney's fees and costs. \nBecause the Court determines that the Board did not afford Meza due process in imposing \nsex-offender conditions as conditions of his parole and such conclusion mandates that he be afforded \na new hearing before the Board, the Court need not determine Meza's remaining complaints at this \ntime. \nAnalysis \nColeman v. Dretke \nMeza bases his sex-offe nder-conditions due-process claim on Coleman v. Dretke, 395 FJd \n216,219 (5th Cir. 2004). While Tony Ray Coleman was on parole for a prior offense, a Texas grand \n11 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 12 of 26\njury indicted him for aggravated sexual assault of a child and indecency with a child by contact. \nColeman, 395 F.3d at 219.  Coleman pleaded guilty to and was convicted of only misdemeanor \nassault, which is not a sex crime.  The State revoked his parole for the prior offense, and he was \nreincarcerated. fa.  The State eventually released Coleman on parole. fa.  A condition of Coleman's \nparole was that he reside at a halfway house until employed.  fa.  A month after the State released \nColeman, it imposed two additional conditions on his parole-that he register as a sex offender and \nthat he receive sex-offender therapy.  fa.  Coleman registered as a sex offender but failed to enroll \nor participate in therapy. The State revoked his parole. fa.  Coleman petitioned for a writ of habeas \ncorpus, alleging that \"the parole panel's imposition of sex offender registration and therapy as \nconditions to his parole, without providing him the opportunity to contest his sex offender status, \nviolated his right to due process.\"  fa. at 221.15  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied the \npetition, as did the federal district court.  fa. at 219. \nThe court of appeals determined that Coleman had a liberty interest in not having a sex-\noffender-therapy condition placed on his parole, because \"due to its highly invasive nature, Texas's \nsex offender therapy program is 'qualitatively different' from other conditions which may attend an \ninmate's release.\"  fa. at 223 (analogizing to Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980)).  The court held \nthat the Due Process Clause, as interpreted in Vitek, protected Coleman from such stigma, and \"the \nstate was required to provide procedural protections before imposing such conditions.\"  fa.  The \nState admitted that it had  not provided Coleman with process before  imposing sex-offender \nconditions on his parole.  Accordingly, the circuit court held that \nAs  a habeas  corpus  petitioner,  Tony Ray  Coleman  sued  Doug Dretke,  Director of the \n15 \nDepartment's  Correctional  Institutions  Division,  the  state  officer  with  supervision  over  his \nincarceration.  Coleman, 395 F.3d at 219. \n12 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 13 of 26\n[t]he Department may condition Coleman's parole on sex offender registration and \ntherapy only if he is determined to constitute a treat to society by reason of his lack \nof sexual control. Absent a conviction of a sex offense, the Department must afford \nhim an appropriate hearing and find that he possesses this offensive characteristic \nbefore imposing such conditions. \nId at 225.16 \nThe State's Coleman Review \nFollowing Coleman, the State implemented procedures to comply with the State's view of \nColeman's mandate.  The State's Coleman review does not include a hearing.  Instead, the Board \nadministratively reviews a parolee's file to determine whether the Board should impose sex -offender \nconditions.  A parolee, such as Meza, who was not convicted of a sex offense, but whose parole \nconditions included sex-offender conditions before Coleman, receives a letter titled \"Notice and \nOpportunity to Respond\" from his parole officer, informing the parolee that the prior imposition of \nthe sex-offender condition is under review (\"Coleman notice\").  The Coleman notice informs the \nparolee why the sex-offender condition was imposed and should be continued and offers the parolee \n30 days to submit documentation contesting imposition of the condition.I7  A parolee may submit \nsuch documentation through his parole officer.  Department employees assemble a packet of \nThe Department was the only Defendant named in Coleman, and the circuit ordered the \n16 \nDepartment to afford Coleman an appropriate hearing.  This Court notes that it is the Board that \nconducts parole hearings and establishes conditions of parole.  The Court considers Coleman's \nmandate to extend to both the Board and the Department.  The Court concludes that Coleman \nrequires the State to provide due process that adequately protects a parolee's liberty interest in not \nhaving sex -offender conditions imposed on his parole. Distinctions between Board and Department \nroles are immaterial for purposes of Coleman-required due process. \nThe Department's Sex Offender Program Administrative Guidelines delineate Coleman review \n17 \nfor parolees who have Special Condition X but have not been convicted of a sex crime.  However, \nthe Notice and Opportunity to Respond-Sex Offender Special Condition Review (form SP-502) does \nnot expressly mention Special Condition X; instead it refers to imposition of \"sex offender treatment \nspecial conditions (sex offender treatment and polygraph)\". \n13 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 14 of 26\ninformation, including the parolee's and, if applicable, his attorney's response, the complete parole \nfile, a psychological evaluation of the parolee, the parolee's polygraph-test results, and a case \nsummary detailing the parolee's social, educational, employment, medical, institutional-adjustment, \nand behavioral history. \nAfter the Department assembles the packet, a Department Sex Offender Program Specialist \nor designee presents the packet to a Board panel. Because Department employees perform much of \nthe work before the panel presentation, such presentations typically last between 10 and 30 minutes, \ndepending on the packet's characteristics. The Board panel reviews the items in the packet as well \nas the parolee's criminal history, police reports, support and protest letters,juvenile record, and the \ncase summary prepared by the parole officer.  Department policy dictates that the presenter shall \nclearly identify the parolee's response for the Board's review.  After the Board panel votes on \nwhether to continue the sex-offe nder-treatment condition, the parole officer is notified of the result, \nthe voted \"transmittal\" is scanned into the State's Offender Information Management System, and \nthe parolee is notified of the  State's decision.  The parolee is then referred for treatment if \nappropriate. \nNeither a parolee who receives a Coleman notice nor the parolee's attorney is allowed to \nreview the parolee's file or told what information the Board will use in reviewing the condition. \nNeither the Board nor the Department provides the parolee with his psychological-evaluation, his \npolygraph results, or a copy of the packet that the Department presents to the Board panel.  Neither \nthe parolee nor his attorney may appear before the Board panel.  The Board produces no written \nfindings. \n14 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 15 of 26\nMeza argues that Coleman requires a hearing at which the State must demonstrate that Meza \nlacks sexual control.  Meza asserts that such a hearing should include written notice, a hearing \nsufficiently after the notice to allow Meza to prepare, disclosure of evidence being relied upon, an \nopportunity to be heard in person and to present documentary evidence, an opportunity at the hearing \nto present witness testimony and to confront and cross examine State witnesses, an independent \ndecision maker, and a written statement by the fact-finder regarding the evidence relied upon and \nthe reasons for the decision.  The State argues that Coleman does not require a hearing or written \nfindings, that the State's Coleman review meets Coleman's requirements,  and that Meza was \nprovided adequate due process. \nThe Conditions To Which Coleman Applies \nThe Department argues Coleman applies only to the treatment requirement of Special \nCondition X,18 not the entire condition.  The Court disagrees and concludes that Coleman's due-\nprocess requirement applies to any sex-offender condition imposed and thus to all components of \nSpecial Condition X.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court notes that a parolee's liberty interest in \nfreedom from sex-offender conditions arises not only from the invasive treatment he must undergo, \nbut also from the stigmatizing consequences of being labeled a sex offender.  Special Condition \nX-the \"Sex Offender Program\" condition-is stigmatizing regardless of its components.  Coleman \nrecognizes that \"prisoners who have not been convicted of a sex offense have a liberty interest \ncreated by the Due Process Clause in freedom from sex offender classification and conditions.\" \nColeman, 395 F.3d at 222 (emphasis added); see also Coleman v. Dretke, 409 FJd 665,668 (5th \n18 Presumably the Department is referring to the components that read: \"I shall participate in the \nSex Offender Treatment Program ...\"  and \"[ eJ nroll in and participate in a treatment program for sex \noffenders as directed by the supervising parole officer.\" \n15 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 16 of 26\nCir. 2005) (Coleman 11)( discussing the stigmatizing effect of sex-offender label).  The Court also \nnotes that Department Coleman policies refer to Special Condition X generally, not its components. \nMeza has not been convicted of a sex crime.  He has been convicted of murder.  The State \ndoes not dispute that Coleman's requirements apply to Meza or that he has a protected liberty interest \nin freedom from sex-offender conditions.  Since 2002, Meza's parole has been conditioned on his \ncompliance with sex-offender conditions, including sex-offender treatment, similar to that at issue \nin Coleman.  Id. at 223. Meza received and signed a Coleman notice on February 23, 2005. Meza's \nColeman notice informed him that the State conditioned his parole on sex-offender treatment, \nbecause a sex-offe nder-treatment provider indicated Meza should attend such treatment and should \nnot be allowed contact with children.  The Coleman notice offered Meza 30 days to  submit \ndocumentation contesting imposition of the  condition.  Meza did not submit a statement or \ndocumentation to contest the conditions.19 \nThe Court concludes that Coleman applies to any State sex-offender condition imposed on \na parolee who has not been convicted of a sex crime. \nWhat Process is Due? \nThe requirements of due process are flexible and should be tailored to the situation. Mathews \nv.  Eldridge, 424 U.S.  319, 334 (1975).  To determine the appropriate due process in a given \nsituation, a court considers: \n[f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk \nof an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \nprobable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, \nBecause the  Court concludes that the  State's Coleman  review did not comply with the \n19 \nrequirements of due process, the Court also concludes that Meza's failure to respond to the State's \nconstitutionally deficient notice does not result in Meza's waiving his objections to the process. \n16 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 17 of 26\nthe  Government's  interest,  including the  function  involved  and the  fiscal  and \nadministrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would \nentail. \nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 224-25 (2005) (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335). \nThe Court first considers Meza's private interest in freedom from sex-offender conditions. \n\"[B]y requiring Coleman to attend sex offender therapy, the state labeled him a sex offender-a label \nwhich strongly implies that Coleman has been convicted of a sex offense and which can undoubtedly \ncause 'adverse social consequences.'\" Coleman 11,409 FJd at 668.  The same is true of the State's \ntreatment of Meza. Meza's interest in freedom from sex-offender conditions is significant. Meza's \nsex-offender status and related stigma have likely contributed to his inability to secure employment. \nDespite State witnesses' assertions that they would \"love\" for Meza to find a job, the record also \nreflects  that  the  State  informs  Meza's  potential  employers  he  is  a sex  offender.  Without \nemployment, Meza cannot form a viable residence plan, leave TCCC, or \"be with family and friends \nand [] form the other enduring attachments of normal life.\" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 \n(1972). \nThe second Mathews factor is the risk of erroneous deprivation ofMeza' s private interest and \nthe probable value of additional procedural safeguards. Despite the State's notice to Meza, without \nthe State informing him what evidence would be used against him, Meza was unable to prepare an \ninformed response to the State's position.  With more complete information Meza could better \nrespond and through adversary hearings could assure that all relevant issues are considered. \"[T]he \nsubtleties and nuances\" of the expert psychologist and therapist opinions and reports involved in sex-\noffender determinations justify requiring adversary hearings.  Vitek, 445 U.S. at 495.  The State's \n17 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 18 of 26\nColeman  review therefore  creates a risk of erroneous deprivation,  and additional procedural \nprotections will help prevent such risk. \nUnder the final Mathews factor, the Court considers the State's interests and evaluates the \nfiscal and administrative burdens that additional procedural safeguards would place on the State. \nThe  State's interest in  identifying,  supervising,  and rehabilitating  sex offenders is  obviously \nsignificant, but does not obviate the need to protect Meza' s private interest. The State argues it will \nbe financially burdensome to increase procedural protections for offenders whose parole it hopes to \ncondition on sex-offender-conditions.20  The Court rejects the State's analysis.  Although adding \nprocedures will cause some administrative and financial burden to the State, the Court finds, based \non the record before it, that affording additional procedural protections to Meza and others similarly \nsituated would not be a significant burden on the State. \nRelying on Austin, the State urges the Court to find that the State's current Coleman review \nmeets the requirements of due process. See Austin, 545 U.S. at 213.  In Austin, the Supreme Court \nfound a liberty interest in Ohio prison inmates' freedom from placement in an Ohio \"Supermax\" \nFox testified that to conduct Coleman reviews in the same format as parole-revocation hearings, \n20 \nthe Board would need two additional Board members, four additional commissioners, and greater \nsupport staff, at an annual cost of approximately $750,000.  Janet Latham, a Department Sex \nOffender Program Specialist, testified that the Department would need additional staff, and more \ntime spent by existing staff, to conduct such hearings and would need legislative help to do so. \nLatham concluded the Department would need 113 additional full-time employees, including 38 \ntreatment providers, which would cost approximately $477,000 for start-up and training costs, plus \n$1.5 million for additional treatment providers.  The record does not contain the details on which \nFox and Latham based these estimates, but the Court is skeptical so many additional employees \nwould be necessary to add elements to extant procedures. The Court notes that the Board may write \nand implement rules regarding the conduct of a parole or mandatory-supervision hearing and the \nconditions to be imposed on a parolee.  See Tex. Govt. Code Ann. ยง 508.441(c). \n18 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 19 of 26\nprison facility. Id The court held that Ohio's Supermax-assignment procedures complied with due \nprocess requirements.  Id.  The Court finds Austin distinguishable from this case. \nThe procedures at issue in Austin provided greater protections than the State's Coleman \nreview.  Ohio initiates proceedings by providing the inmate with written notice summarizing the \nconduct or offense triggering the review and access to the detailed form  prepared to  initiate \nproceedings.  Id at 216.  The inmate may then attend a hearing, present objections to proposed \nSupermax placement, and submit a written statement.  Id  After the hearing, if state officials \nrecommend Supermax placement, they document their reasoning in a report that is then reviewed \nat two more levels, each of which provides written reasons for its findings if it recommends \nSupermax placement. Id at 216-17. The inmate receives a copy of the decision and reasons and has \n15 days to file objections, which state officials consider at a final level of review.  If state officials \nfinally decide to place the inmate in the Supermax facility, they note the reasons for their decision \nin a document, which is again provided to the inmate. Id  Once an inmate is placed in the Supermax \nfacility, he receives a review 30 days later. Id In comparison, when the State reviewed Meza's sex \noffender conditions it did not provide him materials on which to base his response, did not allow him \nto appear and present evidence at a hearing, produced no written findings, the decision was not \nsubject to any level of review, and the only reason provided for the condition's imposition was \"[a] \nsex offender treatment provider has indicated that you should attend sex offender treatment and \nshould not be allowed contact wi children.\"  Compare id 216-17. \nHaving considered Meza's and the State's interests and the benefit of additional procedures, \nthe Court concludes that the \"appropriate hearing\" called for by Coleman requires more than the \nState currently provides.  Coleman, 395 FJd at 225. \n19 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 20 of 26\nThe Requirements of Due Process for Meza \nIn the parole-revocation-hearing context, the minimum requirements of due process are: (1) \nwritten notice of claimed violations; (2) disclosure of relevant evidence;  (3) opportunity for the \nparolee to appear in person and present witnesses and documentary evidence; (4) the right to \nconfront and cross examine adverse witnesses, unless good cause is  shown for not allowing \nconfrontation; (5) an independent hearing body; and (6) a written statement of the evidence relied \nupon by the fact-finders in reaching their decision and reasons for reaching their decision. Morrissey \nv. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,489 (1972). \nIn Coleman, the Fifth Circuit relied on Vitek v. Jones in determining that parolees have a \nliberty interest in freedom from sex-offender treatment.  Coleman, 395 FJd 223; Coleman 11,409 \nFJd at 668.  In Vitek, the Supreme Court affirmed a district-court opinion mandating procedural \nprotections that substantially mirrored the Morrissey requirements.  445 U.S. at 494-96; see Miller \nv. Vitek, 437F.Supp. 569, 574 (D. Neb. 1977). Although Coleman did not delineate what procedures \nare required to protect a parolee's liberty interest in freedom from sex-offender treatment, Vitek \nrequired parole-revocation-type procedural protections.  See Vitek, 445 U.S. at 494-45; Morrissey, \n408 U.S. at 489; Coleman, 395 FJd 223. \nThe  State's Coleman  review complies with some,  but not all,  of the  Morrissey-Vitek \nrequirements. Through Coleman review, the State provided Meza with notice that it was reviewing \nhis sex-offender-treatment conditions and allowed him to respond. Additionally, the State provides \nan independent decision maker in the Board. See Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 485-87 (describing parole \nofficer as person too intimately connected with parolee's case to provide the appropriate decision-\n20 \n\n., \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 21 of 26\nmaking objectivity in parole-revocation hearing, but stating some other administrative officer would \nbe appropriate). \nThe State did not, however, disclose relevant evidence, give Meza an opportunity to appear \nin person and present witnesses and documentary evidence, to confront and cross examine adverse \nwitnesses, or produce written findings regarding the evidence it relied on and the reasons for its \ndecision.  Coleman requires that the State determine Meza constitutes a threat to society by reason \nof his lack of sexual control.  In doing so, it must \"afford him an appropriate hearing and find that \nhe possesses this offensive characteristic.\"  Coleman, 395 FJd at 225.  The record in this case is \nutterly devoid of findings regarding Meza. The Court rejects the State's argument that the continued \nimposition of sex-offender conditions constitutes a sufficient \"finding\" that Meza possesses the \noffensive characteristic of lack of sexual control or the basis for such \"finding.\" \nThe Court notes that prison disciplinary proceedings require fewer due-process protections \nthan parole-revocation procedures.  At a minimum, however, due process requires that inmates be \nafforded advance written notice of the claimed violation and a written statement by fact-finders \nregarding the evidence relied upon and reasons for the disciplinary action taken.  See Wolff v. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563 (1973).  The Court sees no reason the State cannot afford Meza at \nleast the procedural protections afforded prison inmates and concludes that the State's Coleman \nfindings must be written and specific. See Vitek, 445 U.S. at 494-95; WoW; 418 U.S. at 563.  As to \nthe decision to implement sex -offender conditions, \"the provision for a written record helps to insure \nthat administrators, faced with possible scrutiny by state officials and the public, and perhaps even \nthe courts, where fundamental constitutional rights may have been abridged, will act fairly.\"  Wolff, \n418 U.S. at 565. \n21 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 22 of 26\nDisclosure of the evidence that will be relied upon and opportunity to be heard in person and \npresent documentary evidence have been called \"so fundamental that little discussion of them is \nneeded.\"  Miller, 437 F.Supp. at 574, aff'd Vitek, 445 U.S. at 495-96.  Regarding the evidence the \nState will rely upon, Department Sex Offender Program Specialist Janet Latham testified that \nalthough the State does not currently provide offenders with their psychological evaluations and \npolygraph-test results, there is no policy against providing them. The Court sees no reason the State \ncannot provide the evidence supporting its position to Meza so he may prepare an informed response \nto such evidence.  The State need not provide Meza with his entire parole file, but must allow him \naccess to the information that the State will use in deciding whether to continue to impose sex \noffender conditions. Likewise, in the interest of safety, the State may reasonably redact identifying \ninformation. \nMeza and his attorney must be allowed to appear in person at a hearing at which the State \nconsiders whether to continue imposing sex-offender conditions. At such a hearing, Meza must, at \na minimum, be afforded an opportunity to be heard and present documentary evidence. He must also \nbe able to call witnesses \"when permitting him to do so will not be unduly hazardous to institutional \nsafety or correctional goals.\"  Wolff, 518 U.S. at 566. \nWhether Meza should be able to confront and cross examine State witnesses is a slightly \ndifferent question, and here the Court finds Vitek and Miller persuasive. See Vitek, 445 U.S. at 496; \nMiller, 437 F.Supp. at 574 (\"the nature of the inquiry in a mental hearing holds a sufficiently low \npossibility of friction that it appears to us there is a right to call witnesses and confront and cross \nexamine witnesses ....\" ).  Here, the question whether the State may continue to impose sex \noffender conditions will most likely not implicate concerns for inmates' or other parolees' safety or \n22 \n\n1  ,  T  Case 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 23 of 26\noutweigh the benefits of allowing confrontation and cross examination.  Compare Wolff, 418 U.S. \nat 567-69 (describing potential for prison disruption if inmates facing discipline could confront and \ncross  examine  adverse  witnesses).  An  appropriate  hearing  must  therefore  include  Meza's \nopportunity to call witnesses and confront and cross examine adverse witnesses, \"except upon a \nfinding, not arbitrarily made, of good cause for not permitting each as to a particular witness.\" \nMiller, 437 F.Supp. at 574, aff'd Vitek, 445 U.S. at 496 (\"The interests of the State in avoiding \ndisruption was recognized [by the district court] by limiting in appropriate circumstances the \nprisoner's right to call witnesses, to confront and cross examine.\"). \nIn summary, this Court concludes that due process requires that the State afford Meza an \nappropriate hearing, including: (1) written notice in advance of the hearing; (2) disclosure of the \nevidence on which the State is relying; (3) a hearing, scheduled sufficiently after the notice to permit \nMeza to prepare, at which he will have the opportunity to be heard in person, represented by counsel, \nand to present documentary evidence in his support; (4) an opportunity at the hearing to call \nwitnesses and  confront and cross examine State witnesses, \"except upon a finding, not arbitrarily \nmade, of good cause for not permitting each as to a particular witness\"; (5) an independent decision \nmaker; and (6) a written statement by the fact-finder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons \nfor the decision. Miller, 437 F. Supp. at 574. The State must afford Meza effective and timely notice \nof all these rights. The State may only continue to impose sex -offender conditions on Meza' s parole \nif, through these procedures, it determines that he \"constitute[s] a threat to society by reason of his \nlack of sexual control.\"  Coleman, 395 FJd at 225. \nThe State has failed to provide Meza this level of process. \n23 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 353    Filed 03/24/09   Page 24 of 26\nMeza's Remaining Due-Process and Equal-Protection Claims \nMeza also argues he has a liberty interest in freedom from certain of his other conditions and \ntheir components, specifically Special Condition 0.99 (parole-officer-escort condition), 0.06 (child-\nsafety-zone condition), other child-safety-zone components (within SISP and Special Condition X), \nand the requirement that he live at TCCC. Meza argues the State violates his equal-protection rights \nby subjecting him to intentional, irrational treatment. \nThe Court notes that the record reflects that the State has managed to keep Meza incarcerated \nsince 2002, despite the fact that he is on parole and should be able to use this time to readjust to \nsociety before his sentence expires in 2017. The Court has received and considered the Declaration \nof Linda Scavella, which establishes that even after the trial in this case, the Department resists \nallowing Meza to live beyond the jail, although housing options exist that comply with Meza's \nconditions.21  Such evidence, when considered with the record as a whole, causes the Court to \nquestion the sincerity of all assertions by the State that it desires Meza to find ajob, create a viable \nresidence plan, or live in the community. \nRegardless of the State's protestations to the contrary, Mezahas remained incarcerated since \nhis mandatory supervision began in 2002. No reasonable observer may conclude otherwise. To cite \nbut one example, the conditions of Meza's parole, as decreed by the Board, do not restrict his time \noutside of TCCC.  The Board has compelled, however, that Meza always be accompanied by a \nprobation officer.  The Department has determined, on its own, to restrict Meza's time outside of \nOn December 23,2008, Meza filed his Opposed Motion to Supplement the Record (Clerk's \n21 \nDocument 351), seeking to supplement the record with the Declaration of Linda Scavella. The State \nfiled no response, and the Court hereby GRANTS the motion to supplement as unopposed. See Loc. \nR. W.D. Tex.

The Court finds that the Department, \nthrough this action alone,  is inhibiting or preventing Meza's securing employment.  Without \nemployment, Meza may not develop a viable residence plan that would allow him to leave TCCC. \nThus, under the State's current practice, he will remain incarcerated in TCCC until the expiration \nof his sentence in 2017, then be released into society, having received none of the presumed benefits \nof gradual reassimilation. \nBecause the Court has concluded that Coleman's \"appropriate hearing\" mandate requires \nmore robust procedural protections than the State's current Coleman review, the Court does not \ntoday reach these remaining claims and will dismiss them without prejudice.  The Court is certain \nthat the State will use the hearing and review process ordered today to reevaluate all of Meza's \nparole conditions and restrictions on his freedom, whether ordered by the Board or instituted by the \nDepartment, and consider such reasonable changes as will enhance Meza's opportunity to safely \nreintegrate into society. \nConclusion \nIn light ofthe foregoing, the Court renders the following declaration, injunction, and orders: \nTHE COURT DECLARES that the State failed to afford Meza \"a hearing meeting the \nrequirements of due process\" when it imposed sex-offender conditions on his parole.

No. 162);\nDefendant Owensโ Motion to Dismiss (Clerkโs Doc. No. 130) and Defendants Aliseda, Davis,\nDenoyelles, Aycock, Garcia, and Gonzalesโs Motion to Dismiss (Clerkโs Doc. No. 150).\nI.      BACKGROUND\nOn March 9, 1982, Raul Meza pled guilty to murdering a 9 year-old girl and was sentenced\nto  30  years  imprisonment.    On  September  8,  1989,  Meza  was  sentenced  to  an  additional,\nconsecutive, four years of imprisonment for possession of a deadly weapon in a penal institution.\nIn 1993, Meza was released from prison on mandatory supervision, but violated his parole and was\nsent back to prison. Meza was again released on September 25, 2002, on mandatory supervision, as\ndictated by statute.  Meza filed this lawsuit on December 5, 2005, alleging that Defendant parole\nofficers, Collier and Livingston, violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(โRLUIPAโ) and his constitutional rights.  In his Third Amended Complaint, Meza added the same\ncharges against various defendants who work for the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles (โthe TBPP\nDefendantsโ).  \n\nDefendants Livingston and Collier jointly filed a motion to dismiss the claims against them\nin their official capacities and Collier filed a motion to dismiss in his individual capacity.  In a\nReport and Recommendation by this Court โ adopted by Judge Yeakel โ it was recommended that\nCollierโs and Livingstonโs motions should be granted in part and denied in part.  While Judge Yeakel\nadopted the Report and Recommendation, he ordered further briefing on Mezaโs nascent due process\nand equal protection clause claims.  (Clerkโs Doc. No. 52 at 8-9.)  On January 29, 2007, this Court\nissued an order establishing a briefing schedule for Livingston and Collier to further brief the due\nprocess and equal protection issues.  (Clerkโs Doc. No. 69.)  They replied by filing their Second\nMotions to Dismiss on these issues on February 7, 2007.  (Clerkโs Doc. No. 73.)  Meza responded\non February 19, 2007 (Clerkโs Doc. No. 86), and the Defendants replied on March 8, 2007 (Clerkโs\nDoc. Nos. 103, 104).  \nA week later, Collier and Livingston โ and Plaintiff โ also filed summary judgment motions\nmaking many of the same arguments.  Therefore, Judge Yeakel dismissed Collier and Livingstonโs\nmotions to dismiss, see Clerkโs Doc. No. 157, and referred the pending summary judgments motions\nto this Court for a Report and Recommendation.  However, there remain outstanding motions to\ndismiss that this Report and Recommendation will resolve:  the TBPP Defendantโ motions to dismiss\nand Collierโs Third Motion to Dismiss (filed to address arguments he states he raised in his earlier\nmotion to dismiss, but not in his summary judgment motion).\nMezaโs Third Amended Complaint alleges that the Defendants have violated his equal\nprotection and due process rights in a variety of ways.  Meza alleges that he has not been given the\nsame opportunities as other supervisees to acquire a job, obtain a driverโs license, or receive\neducation such that his rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth\n2\n\nAmendment have been violated.  He further contends that sex offender conditions were imposed\nupon him without due process, because his attorneys (who Defendants knew represented him) were\nnot given notice of the intent to impose such conditions, and because his objections to those\nconditions were ignored.  Meza also alleges that while in prison he has become a devout (non-\ndenominational) Christian.  He argues that his rights under RLUIPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc, are\nviolated by conditions and regulations requiring that: (1) he wear his prison uniform to attend\nreligious services; (2) he is prohibited from leaving the jail to attend church services (unlike other\nparolees); and (3) he was prohibited from leaving the jail to attend his cousinโs funeral.  Meza seeks\ncompensatory and punitive damages, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief.  \nII.    ANALYSIS\nThe Court will first discuss the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendantsโ motions and\nthen will take up the arguments specific to Collierโs motion to dismiss the claims against him in his\nindividual capacity. \nA. Standard of Review.\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), โa claim will not be dismissed unless the\nplaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.โ  Gen.\nElec. Capital Corp. v. Posey, 415 F.3d 391, 395 (5th Cir. 2005).  โA district court cannot dismiss\na complaint for failure to state a claim โunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove\nno set of facts that would entitle him to relief.โโ United States ex rel. Bain  v. Georgia Gulf Corp.,\n386 F.3d 648, 653-54 (5th Cir. 2004).  The complaint must be liberally construed in favor of the\nplaintiff and all facts pleaded therein must be taken as true.  Kane Enters. v. MacGregor (USA) Inc.,\n322 F.3d 371, 374 (5th  Cir. 2003).  โHowever, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions\n3\n\nmasquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.โ Jones v. Alcoa,\nInc., 339 F.3d 359, 362 (5th Cir. 2003).  \nB. Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendantsโ Motions to Dismiss\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendants (โthe TBPP Defendantsโ) โ Rissie\nOwens, Jose Aliseda, Charles Aycock, Conrith Davis, Jackie DeNoyelles, Linda Garcia, and Juanita\nM. Gonzales โ move to dismiss all of the claims against them, on several grounds.  See Clerkโs Doc.\nNo. 130, 150.  First, they claim that the equal protection claim is not properly stated.  Next, they\nassert that Meza has failed to state the elements of a RLUIPA claim.  Third, they assert that the due\nprocess claim is lacking because the restrictions imposed on Meza are permitted, and because he was\ngiven notice of the intent to impose sex offender restrictions, and an opportunity to be heard.\nFinally, the TPBB Defendants assert that they are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n1. Equal Protection โClass of Oneโ Claim.\nIn their first argument, the TPBB Defendantsโ contend that Meza has failed to state an equal\nprotection claim.  Meza is proceeding under the Village of Willowbrook v. Olech โclass of oneโ equal\nprotection theory, which requires that he show he has been intentionally treated differently from\nothers similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.  528 U.S.\n562, 564 (2000).  In his briefing, Collier relies on Bryan v. City of Madison, 213 F.3d 267 (5th Cir.\n2000), which puts some gloss on Olech.  Bryan held that in โselective enforcementโ equal protection\nclaims the plaintiff must show โan improper motive, such as racial animus . . . .โ  Id. at 277.  The\nTBPP Defendants argue that because Meza has not shown they acted with any improper motive, his\nclaim should be dismissed.  \n4\n\nThis case, however, is not best described as a selective enforcement claim.  The Fifth Circuit,\nin Mikeska v. City of Galveston, implied in a footnote that it had recognized an additional variety of\nclass of one equal protection claim, โpersonal vindictiveness.โ  451 F.3d 376, 381 n.4 (5th Cir.\n2006).1  While the Fifth Circuit has not squarely addressed the issue, the Seventh Circuit has.  In\ntypically persuasive fashion, Judge Posner noted that if  โa merely unexplained difference in police\ntreatment of similar complaints made by different people established a prima facie case of denial of\nequal protection of the laws, the federal courts would be drawn deep into the local enforcement of\npetty state and local laws.โ  Hilton v. City of Wheeling, 209 F.3d 1005, 1008 (7th Cir. 2000).\nUtilizing Justice Breyerโs concurrence in Olech, 528 U.S. at 565-66 (agreeing with disposition but\ncontending that there should be an โextra factorโ requirement of โvindictive actionโ or the like to\nproceed under a โclass of oneโ theory) (Breyer, J., concurring), Judge Posner stated that:\nto make out a prima facie case the plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant\ndeliberately sought to deprive him of the equal protection of the laws for reasons of\na personal nature unrelated to the duties of the defendantโs position. We described\nthe class of equal protection cases illustrated by Olech as โvindictive actionโ cases\nand said that they require โproof that the cause of the differential treatment of which\nthe plaintiff complains was a totally illegitimate animus toward the plaintiff by the\ndefendant.โ\nId. (citation omitted).2   \n1A more accurate statement might be that the Fifth Circuit has recognized the possibility of\nsuch a claim but never expressly passed on it.  Parude v. City of Natchez 72 Fed. Appโx 102, 104-05\n(5th Cir. 2003) (stating โthat personal vindictiveness might be an improper motive in a selective\nenforcement case, but [we] ha[ve] never specifically addressed whether such a motive would be\nenough to support an equal protection claim without some other class-based discriminationโ); see\nalso Beeler v. Rounsavall, 328 F.3d 813, 817-818 (5th Cir. 2003) (declining to address issue).  \n2To muddy the waters further, the Fifth Circuit, in an unpublished opinion from 2002, Shipp\nv. McMahon, cited Hilton โ in the context of a ยง1983 qualified immunity case to determine whether\nthe right was clearly established at the time โ for the โpersonal vindictivenessโ equal protection\ntheory, and stated that  โthe Courtโs earlier decision in this case, Shipp I, may or may not have\n5\n\nAs Meza points out in his Response, in the years 2005 and 2006, TDCJ and TBPP released\nwell over 1,000 individuals who had been convicted of murder. Of those, Meza is one of only two\nparolees placed under such strict conditions.  At this procedural stage, there is nothing the Court can\nlook to to determine the TBPPโs motives in setting Mezaโs conditions, and the Court must take\nMezaโs pleadings as true.  Given this, and given the state of the law as just described, the Court\nbelieves that Meza has pled enough to continue with his equal protection claim.\n2. Religious Exercise Claims under RLUIPA.  \nThe TBPP Defendants also contend that Mezaโs RLUIPA claim against them must be\ndismissed because he has failed to plead facts that allege a โsubstantial burdenโ on his practice of\nreligion.  The relevant section of the RLUIPA states:\n(a) General rule\nNo government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a\nperson residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if the burden results from a\nrule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of\nthe burden on that person:\n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n(2)  is  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  that compelling\ngovernmental interest.\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc.  Initially, it falls to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the government practice\ncomplained of imposes a โsubstantial burdenโ on his religious exercise.  Adkins v. Kaspar, 393 F.3d\n559, 567 (5th Cir. 2004).  This requires the court to answer two questions: (1) is the burdened\nactivity โreligious exercise,โ and if so (2) is the burden โsubstantial?โ  Id.  \nextendedโ the class of one theory to police protection. 54 Fed. Appโx 413, (5th Cir. 2002).\n6\n\nUnder RLUIPA, โexercise of religionโ is defined to include โany exercise of religion,\nwhether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000bb-2(4),\n2000cc-5(7)(A).  The Supreme Court has said that โโ[T]he โexercise of religionโ often involves not\nonly belief and profession but the performance of . . . physical acts [such as] assembling with others\nfor a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use of bread and wine . . . .โ  Cutter v.\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720 (2005) (citation omitted).  \nIt would appear that attending a funeral is a religious exercise as contemplated by RLUIPA.\nWhile the Court was unable to locate any cases directly addressing this issue, in the vast majority\nof well-established religions, funerals have great religious significance, and are marked with a\nreligious ceremony.  Accordingly, attending such a ceremony would appear to be as much an\nexercise of religion as attending normal sabbath services would be, and attendance at these services\nis plainly an exercise of religion under Cutter.  544 U.S. at 720.  This conclusion is also consistent\nwith other cases addressing what is an โexerciseโ of religion for RLUIPA purposes.  See e.g., Adkins\nv. Kaspar, 393 F.3d 559, 570 (5th Cir. 2000) (sabbath and holy day gatherings qualify as religious\nexercise); Lovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir. 2006) (observance of Ramadan a religious\nexercise); Konikov v. Orange County, Fla., 410 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir. 2005) (rabbiโs use of\nproperty for Torah study and celebration of Jewish holidays a religious exercise); Maria v. Broaddus,\n2003 WL 21782633 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (prisonerโs belief in Nation of Gods and Earths religion (aka\nas the โFive Percentersโ aligned with Black Muslim movement) was sincere and religious in nature\nand therefore was a religious exercise); Mintz v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield, 424 F.\nSupp.2d 309, 318-19 (D. Mass. 2006) (holding that Catholic churchโs application for permit to\nconstruct parish center that is central to church programs and services is religious exercise).  \n7\n\nThe more problematic issue for Meza is whether the burden imposed on his exercise of\nreligion when he was prevented from attending his cousinโs funeral was โsubstantial.โ  On this issue,\nMezaโs claim fails.  Taking as true all of the facts pled be Meza, the only service he complains he\nwas prevented from attending was his cousinโs funeral.  His Third Amended Complaint fails to\nidentify what sort of service the funeral was, other than a โmass.โ  He identifies himself as a\nโChristian.โ  Thus, assuming that the funeral services consisted of a Catholic mass and burial\nservices,3 it is not even clear from the complaint that Meza was prevented from attending services\nof his own church when he was not allowed to attend the funeral.  Regardless, even giving him the\nbenefit of that assumption, the sole service he complains he was prevented from attending was this\nfuneral.  His complaint affirmatively  establishes that he is permitted to attend other services (Clerkโs\nDoc. No. 96 at ยถ 43).  While there is no case law addressing what the boundaries are regarding when\noneโs exercise of religion becomes substantially impaired, it is clear where this case falls.  The Court\ncan say as a matter of law that a complaint alleging a supervisee was prevented from attending only\none religious ceremony over a several year period fails to state a claim that the superviseeโs exercise\nof religion has suffered a โsubstantialโ burden.\nMezaโs other complaint under RLUIPA relates to the requirement that he attend worship\nservices in TCCC โ in his prison garb โ and not, like other parolees, out in the community.  Meza\nsomewhat conflates his complaints here, but the issue is whether his allegation that wearing a prison\nuniform while attending service at TCCC is a substantial burden on his exercise of religion.  The\nCourt finds it is not.  Mezaโs complaint in this regard is stated in conclusory terms, and he must\n3The complaint alleges that Meza was prevented from attending a โfuneral mass and\nservices.โ  Clerkโs Doc. No. 96 at ยถ 44.  From the use of the term โmass,โ the Court could assume\nthe service was Catholic (or perhaps Anglican or Episcopalian).\n8\n\nmake more than simple assertions.  See Jones v. Alcoa, Inc., 339 F.3d 359, 362 (5th Cir. 2003)\n(conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to\nprevent a motion to dismiss).  He has completely failed to plead any facts that his clothing is\nimportant to the exercise of his religion (as it might be if he were, for example, an Hassidic Jew),\nor to explain how wearing prison garb interferes with his religious exercises (other than to assert he\nconsiders it to โdemean his religious activitiesโ).  Again, taking all of the allegations of his complaint\nas true, as a matter of law Mezaโs complaint regarding having to attend services in his prison garb\nfails to state a claim under RLUIPA.4\n3. Due Process Claims.\nThe TBPP Defendants next argue that Mezaโs due process claims should be dismissed.  Meza\ncontends that collectively, the restrictions placed on him violate his due process rights. Sandin v.\nConner is the touchstone case here.  515 U.S. 472 (1995). There, the Court held that States may,\nunder certain circumstances, create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause.\nBut these interests will generally be limited to freedom from restraints which, while not exceeding\nthe sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause\nof its own force, nonetheless impose atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.  Id. at 483- 484.  After Sandin, it is clear that the touchstone of\nthe inquiry is the nature of the challenged conditions โin relation to the ordinary incidents of prison\nlife.โ  Id. at 484.  โPrisoners do not shed all constitutional rights at the prison gate.โ  Coleman v.\n4To the extent Meza complains that TBPP refuses to permit him to attend services away from\nthe TCCC, but allows other supervisees to leave for that purpose, that claim is properly considered\nas part of his equal protection and due process claims.  Again, because he is permitted to attend\nservices at TCCC, and because he fails to allege any burden imposed by attending services there as\nopposed to in the community, this restriction does not state a claim under RLUIPA.\n9\n\nDretke, 395 F.3d 216, 221 (5th Cir. 2004).  Despite the restrictions imposed by incarceration, the\nDue Process Clause guarantees a prisoner some process before the government can impose\nconditions that are qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a\nprisoner and which have stigmatizing consequences.  Id.  \nMeza complains that sex offender restrictions were placed on him without proper notice and\nhearing, as required by Coleman.  395 F.3d at 223-24.  The TBPP Defendants contend that Meza was\nindeed given the requisite level of due process because he was notified of the decision and was given\nan opportunity โ which he took advantage of โ to respond.  They further contend that Coleman does\nnot require that Mezaโs attorneys be notified, so it is irrelevant that the Defendants failed to do so\nhere.\nThis is not an issue that should be resolved at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage of the proceedings.  The\nColeman Court concluded that:\nThe Department may condition Coleman's parole on sex offender registration and\ntherapy only if he is determined to constitute a threat to society by reason of his lack\nof sexual control. Absent a conviction of a sex offense, the Department must afford\nhim an appropriate hearing and find that he possesses this offensive characteristic\nbefore imposing such conditions. This court was told at oral argument that evidence\nof Colemanโs lack of sexual control exists. None appears in the record, however, and\nno contention is made that Coleman has been afforded a hearing meeting the\nrequirements of due process.\nId. at 225.  There are too many facts that are not developed at this point to determine whether the\nprocess afforded Meza satisfied due process requirements.  Coleman seems to require a hearing and\nit is far from clear from the pleaded facts whether Meza received one.  There is also no evidence in\nthe record that a lack of sexual control exists in Mezaโs case.  Moreover, simply noting, as the TBPP\nDefendants do, that Coleman did not explicitly say that noticing an attorney was required proves\n10\n\nnothing.  That was not an issue in that case.  All of these issues need factual development and further\nbriefing by the parties.\nTied into this is Mezaโs due process claim that covers the other restrictions imposed on him,\nsuch as not being given the same opportunities as other supervisees to acquire a job, obtain a driverโs\nlicense, receive education, or attend church services.  The TBPP Defendants argue, somewhat\npuzzlingly, that โ[s]upervision, then, is a โspecial needโ of the State permitting a degree of\nimpingement upon privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the public at largeโ (citing\nGriffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 875 (1987)).  But of course the issue here is not whether Mezaโs\nparole restrictions comport with due process vis-a-vis the general public; it is whether they violate\nhis constitutional rights vis-a-vis the restrictions placed on other supervisees.  Taking Mezaโs\npleadings as true, Meza has pled enough to hurdle the low bar of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\nHe has alleged several restrictions that appear qualitatively different than those imposed on other\nsupervisees, thus stating a claim under Sandin v. Conner.\n4. Eleventh Amendment.\nThe last issue is whether the TBPP Defendant are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity\non Mezaโs claims.  Meza contends that because he is only seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\nagainst the TBPP Defendants, the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable.  See Ex Parte Young, 209\nU.S. 123, 159-60 (1908).  The TBPP Defendants argue that โMeza is requesting that Defendants be\nenjoined from requiring him to wear a jail uniform in order to attend worshipโ and they have no\nauthority over TCCC to tell it what to do โ therefore, they are immune because it is beyond their\nauthority.  See Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 417 (5th Cir. 2001) (โThus, any probe into the\nexistence of a Young exception should gauge: (1) the ability of the official to enforce the statute at\n11\n\nissue under his statutory or constitutional powers, and (2) the demonstrated willingness of the official\nto enforce the statuteโ).\nHowever, the prison uniform requirement is clearly โ as delineated above โ not the only\nconstraint about which Meza is complaining.  His complaints are numerous and he has properly\nasked for only declaratory and injunctive relief.  Under the Eleventh Amendment and Ex Parte\nYoung, the TBPP Defendants are not immune from these claims.  Indeed, the Defendantsโ argument\nis not an Eleventh Amendment argument at all.  Rather, the TBPP Defendants are claiming that they\nare not the proper defendants on this claim.  Whether that is in fact true is an issue that can be dealt\nwith at the summary judgment or trial stage, but it does not entitle the Defendants to immunity from\nsuit.\nIn sum, the Court recommends that the TBPP Defendantsโ Motions to Dismiss be granted\nas to Mezaโs RLUIPA claims, and be denied as to all other claims.\nB. Collierโs Third Motion to Dismiss\nIn his motion to dismiss, Collier first argues that the Court need not reach Mezaโs\nconstitutional claims because Meza is a โprisonerโ for purposes of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(e), which\nprecludes all his claims.  There are a number of steps to this argument.  First, Collier states that Meza\nis on mandatory supervision.  Second, Collier contends, because Meza is on mandatory supervision\nparole,5 he is a prisoner for purposes of the  Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C.\n5Mandatory supervision is โthe release of an eligible inmate . . . so that the inmate may serve\nthe remainder of the inmateโs sentence not on parole but under the supervision of the pardons and\nparoles division.โ  TEX. GOV'T CODE ยง 508.001(5) (Vernon 2004). The parole panel must release an\ninmate on mandatory supervision when his calendar time plus accrued good-conduct time equals the\nmaximum term to which he was sentenced.  Id. ยง 508.147(a).  Release on parole, on the other hand,\nis discretionary with the panel.  Id. ยงยง 508.001(6); 508.141. Importantly, once released, an inmate\non mandatory supervision is considered to be on parole.  Id. ยง 508.147(b). \n12\n\nยง 1997e(e).  This, Collier argues, means that Meza cannot seek compensatory damages because he\nhas alleged no physical injury, a prerequisite under the statute for alleging any federal constitutional\nviolation.  Collier also notes that punitive damages are also not recoverable under the PLRA. \nThe PLRA defines โprisonerโ as โany person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is\naccused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or\nthe terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.โ  28 U.S.C.\nยง 1915(h).  The Fifth Circuit has held that the following test is to be used in determining whether a\nlitigant is a โprisonerโ for purposes of the PLRA: (1) whether the person is โincarcerated or detained\nin any facilityโ and (2) if so, whether it is as a result of his criminal conviction.  Jackson v. Johnson,\n475 F.3d 261, 265 (5th Cir. 2007).  In Jackson, the litigant, who was โa mandatory supervisee of the\nPardons and Paroles Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, who reside[d] at a\nprivately operated halfway house,โ was held to be a prisoner under the PLRA6  Id. at 267.  Here,\nMeza is a โmandatory superviseeโ and is in a halfway house (the TCCC Del Valle Facility7).  Given\nthese important indistinguishable facts, the Court must find that Meza is a โprisonerโ for purposes\nof the PLRA.\nAccording to Collier this seals Mezaโs fate because ยง 1997e(e) states that โNo federal civil\naction may be brought by a prisoner confined to a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for\nmental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.โ\n6It is worth noting that the Fifth Circuitโs definition of โprisonerโ is contrary to other circuitsโ\ncases.  See Jackson, 475 F.3d at 266 (distinguishing contrary holdings from the Eighth, Ninth, and\nEleventh Circuits).\n7Travis  County  Correctional  Complex  is  run  by  the  Travis  County  Sheriffโs  Office.\nAccording to Collier, this facility houses parolees and mandatory supervisees in lieu of a halfway\nhouse in Travis County that will take people who have been convicted of serious offenses.\n13\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(e) (emphasis added).  Therefore, the argument goes, Meza is a prisoner who has\nnot alleged any physical injury, so his claim(s) must fail because he has no damages.  In Geiger v.\nJowers, 404 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir. 2005), the court stated that:\nSection 1997e(e) applies to all federal civil actions in which a prisoner alleges a\nconstitutional violation, making compensatory damages for mental or emotional\ninjuries non-recoverable, absent physical injury.  Thus . . . failure to allege physical\ninjury falls squarely under ยง 1997e(e)โs bar, precluding his recovery of compensatory\ndamages for emotional or mental injuries allegedly suffered as a result of the\npurported First Amendment violation.\nHowever, it seems that Collier has not closely read Mezaโs Complaint. Meza is not asking for\ncompensatory damages based on mental or emotional injury, but instead for lost wages.  See\nPlaintiffโs Third Amended Complaint at 10.  Therefore, Collierโs argument misconceives the issue.\nMeza is also asking for punitive damages.  Collier again attempts to trade on the above\nargument in this context; however, it fails here too: numerous courts of appeals have held that the\n1997e(e) bar does not apply to constitutional claims for nominal and punitive damages.  See Munn\nv. Toney, 433 F.3d 1087, 1089 (8th Cir. 2006); Hubbard v. Taylor, 399 F.3d 150, 167 (3rd Cir. 2005);\nCalhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 940 (7th Cir. 2003); Searles v. Van Bebber, 251 F.3d 869, 879-81\n(10th Cir. 2001) (nominal and punitive damages for First Amendment violation not barred); Allah\nv. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 252 (3rd Cir. 2000) (same); Canell v. Lightner, 143 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th\nCir. 1998) (any form of relief for First Amendment violations available, if not for mental or\nemotional injury); Thompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d 411, 418 (2nd Cir. 2002) (nominal and punitive\ndamages available for deprivation-of-property claim); Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d 623, 630 (9th Cir.\n2002) (compensatory, nominal or punitive damages available if premised on alleged unconstitutional\nconditions of pretrial confinement, and not emotional or mental distress suffered); Doe v. Delie, 257\n14\n\nF.3d 309, 314 n.3 & 323 (3rd Cir. 2001) (nominal and punitive damages available for violation of\ninmates' newly recognized right to medical privacy); but cf. Harris v. Garner, 190 F.3d 1279, 1282,\n1287-88 & n. 9 (ยง 1997e(e) precludes compensatory and punitive damages for alleged violations of\nFourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, but expressing no view on nominal damages), vacated\n& rehโg en banc granted, 197 F.3d 1059 (11th Cir.1999), reinstated in pertinent part, 216 F.3d 970\n(11th Cir.2000); Davis, 158 F.3d at 1348-49 (compensatory and punitive damages for violations of\nconstitutional right to privacy barred, but expressing no view on nominal damages). \nCollier also argues that Meza has not alleged facts to show that Collierโs conduct rises to the\nrequisite level necessary to secure punitive damages.  To warrant punitive damages, Meza must\nallege facts showing that  Collierโs conduct was egregious or reprehensible. See State Farm Mut.\nAuto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 419 (2003); BMW of North Amer. Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S.\n559, 575 (1996).  Taking Mezaโs allegations as true (as the Court must on a motion to dismiss), the\nquestion becomes whether Collier acted sufficiently egregiously so as to permit punitive damages\nwhen he prevented Meza from: (1) obtaining a job by sending armed guards with him to interviews\nand insisting that an armed guard would have to be with him at work; (2) receiving an education;\n(3) getting computer training (Meza has been incarcerated since 1982); and (4) getting a driverโs\nlicense.  Meza alleges that these requirements are not imposed on any other supervisee, and are the\nresult of Collier taking a โspecial interestโ in his case. \nApplying the liberal standard of Rule 12, the Court concludes that these allegations are\nsufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.  In State Farm, the Court said, โWe have\ninstructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether the harm\ncaused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a\n15\n\nreckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial\nvulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was\nthe result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.โ  State Farm, 538 U.S. at 419.\nWhile it is difficult to compare and contrast fundamental rights protected in the Constitution, it is\nprobably fair to say that, save for life, liberty is the most protected, cherished right preserved by our\nfounding document.  Arbitrary restrictions on liberty, imposed based upon a person taking a โspecial\ninterestโ in a superviseeโs case, may rise to a level sufficient to permit the recovery of punitive\ndamages.  Whether that in fact has happened in this case is something for a later day; at this stage\nof the proceedings the Court must accept Mezaโs pleadings as true, and those pleadings are sufficient\nto state a claim for punitive damages.\nCollierโs final argument is that Mezaโs RLUIPA claim should be dismissed because the\nstatute does not contemplate recovery of damages against individuals and Meza is seeking\ncompensatory and punitive damages against Collier.  Although it is not clear from the complaint that\nMeza is asking for compensatory and punitive damages against Collier for RLUIPA violations,\nCollier is, in any event, correct that RLUIPA  governs the conduct of the government, not\nindividuals.   See Gooden v. Crain, 405 F. Supp.2d 714, 723 (E.D. Tex. 2005) (statute only provides\nfor relief โagainst a governmentโ).8  Therefore, if Meza is asserting a RLUIPA claim against Collier,\nit is recommended that it be dismissed.\n8However, it is unclear whether the statute prohibits damages in toto, as Collier intimates.\nSee id.; see also Smith v. Haley, 401 F. Supp.2d 1240, 1245-47 (M.D. Ala. 2005) (noting that it is\nunclear whether damages are unavailable in addition to injunctive relief).  \n16\n\nIn sum, then, Collierโs argument that all of Mezaโs claims should be dismissed because he\nis a prisoner is rejected, but it is recommended that Mezaโs RLUIPA claim, if one in fact was pled\nagainst Collier, be dismissed against Collier in his individual capacity.9\nRECOMMENDATION\nThe Court RECOMMENDS that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendantsโ\nMotions to Dismiss (Clerkโs Docket Nos. 130 & 150) be GRANTED IN PART, and DENIED IN\nPART.  The Court recommends that the Motions to Dismiss be GRANTED as to Mezaโs RLUIPA\nclaims (and any claims for damages thereunder).  The Court recommends that these Motions to\nDismiss be DENIED as to all other claims.\nThe Magistrate Court further RECOMMENDS that Defendant Collierโs Third Motion to\nDismiss (Clerkโs Docket No. 162) be GRANTED IN PART, and DENIED IN PART.  The Court\nrecommends that the Motion to Dismiss be GRANTED as to Mezaโs RLUIPA claims (and any\nclaims for damages thereunder).  The Court recommends that the Motion to Dismiss be DENIED\nas to all other claims, namely the equal protection claims and due process claims based on alleged\ndifferential treatment. \n9Inexplicably, Collier contends in his Third Motion to Dismiss that he did not raise a\nqualified immunity argument in his motion for summary judgment, and he was therefore raising that\nargument for resolution.  Clerkโs Doc. No. 162 at 1-2.  That is clearly incorrect, however, as a\nqualified immunity argument is quite plainly raised in the summary judgment motion under the\nheading โDefendant Collier is Entitled to Qualified Immunity.โ  See Defendant Collierโs Motion for\nSummary Judgment with Brief in Support Clerkโs Doc. No. 110 at 9.  The Court will therefore\naddress the qualified immunity argument when it addresses the summary judgment motion.\n17\n\nV.

Also before the \nCourt is the parties' Joint Status Report on Discovery Issues filed May 25,2007 (Clerk's Document \n202). On May 17, 2007, the Court conducted a hearing on Meza' s motions at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel and at which counsel for Meza and Defendants Livingston and Collier \npresented oral argument.  Having considered Meza's motion and other filings submitted by the \nparties, the oral argument of counsel, the applicable law, and the entire case file, the Court renders \nthe following order. \nMeza first asks this Court to compel Defendant Collier in his individual capacity to respond \nto interrogatories and to produce specific documents.  In addition to seeking information from \nCollier in his individual capacity, Meza seeks information from Defendants Livingston and Collier \nin their official capacities.  By the parties' Joint Status Report, Meza agrees to withdraw a number \nof his discovery requests.  This Court will consider whether to grant Meza's motions to compel as \nto the remaining requests. \nQualified Immunity \nDefendant Collier opposes Meza's motion to compel Collier, in his individual capacity, to \nrespond to discovery on the grounds that he is immune from Meza's discovery requests under the \ndoctrine of qualified immunity. Defendant Collier first made this claim in his Motion for Protective \nOrder filed in this Court on July 28, 2006.  Collier's motion for protective order was referred to \nUnited States Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin for resolution.  On August 30, 2006, Judge Austin \ndenied Collier's first motion for protective order because Judge Austin had rendered a Report and \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 211   Filed 06/13/07   Page 3 of 8\nRecommendation on Collier's Motion to Dismiss (Clerk's Document 26), recommending that \nCollier's motion be denied as to Plaintiff's claims for prospective injunctive relief and that such \nclaims against Collier remain pending for trial.  Judge Austin advised Collier that, if this Court \nrejected the Report and Recommendation regarding Meza's claims for prospective injunctive relief, \nCollier could then renew his request for a protective order. Despite this Court's acceptance of Judge \nAustin's Report and Recommendation, Collier renewed his request for a protective order.  This \nCourt denied Collier's second motion for a protective order on February 6, 2007, noting that is \nrequested relief that was identical to the relief requested in Collier's first motion for a protective \norder. \nDespite this Court's prior rulings and the Court's statement in open court that Collier may \nno longer claim qualified immunity as a defense to discovery in this action, Collier maintains in his \nresponse to Meza's motion to compel that Collier should not be subject to discovery requests \nbecause he is entitled to qualified immunity.  Having considered Collier's renewed arguments, the \nCourt will overrule Collier's objections to discovery on the grounds of qualified immunity. \nNumber of Interrogatories \nCollier, in his official capacity and his individual capacity, and Livingston object that Meza \nis seeking more than the permitted number of interrogatories when the subparts of each interrogatory \nare counted. Parties are limited to serving no more than 25 written interrogatories on another party, \n\"including all discrete subparts.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a).  In this Court, other than five specifically \ndesignated  multipart questions that may be considered one question each, \"subparts count as \nseparate questions.\" W.D. Tex. Local R. CV -33.  Although Meza contends that his subparts relate \nto a \"common theme,\" Rule 33 and Local Rule CV-33's limit applies even if a number of the \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 211   Filed 06/13/07   Page 4 of 8\ninterrogatories are related, other than the subparts specifically designated by this Court's local rules. \nThis Court will deny Meza's motion to compel Livingston and Collier to answer more than 25 \ninterrogatory subparts. \nIn light of the interrogatories to Collier in his individual capacity that Meza agrees to \nwithdraw, the Court finds that the remaining interrogatories will not exceed 25, including subparts. \nThe Court will overrule Collier's objections regarding numerosity of interrogatories as to the \nremaining Interrogatories 1 and 7 in Meza's First Set of Discovery Requests to Collier in his \nindividual capacity.  Similarly, in light of the interrogatories to Collier and Livingston in their \nofficial capacities that Meza agrees to withdraw, the Court will overrule Livingston and Collier's \nobjections regarding numerosity of interrogatories as to the remaining Interrogatories 1 and 8 in \nMeza's  First  Set  of Discovery  Requests  to  Defendants  in  their  official  capacities  and  to \nInterrogatories 1 and 2 of the Second Set of Discovery Requests to Livingston. \nObjections to Requests as Overly Broad and Irrelevant \nLivingston and Collier object to several of Meza's discovery requests on the grounds that \nthe requests are \"overly broad, unduly burdensome, and harassing and not reasonably limited in \nscope and time ... irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible \nevidence.\"  Livingston and Collier's objection relates to Interrogatories 3 and 7 and Request for \nProduction 1 of Meza's First Set of Discovery Requests to Collier in his individual capacity; \nInterrogatories 1 and 8 and Request for Production 1 of Meza's First Set of Discovery Requests to \nDefendants in their official capacities; and to Interrogatories 1 and 2 and Request for Production 1 \nofMeza's Second Set of Discovery Requests to Livingston. \nThe Court again notes that Meza has agreed to withdraw many of his requests for discovery. \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 211   Filed 06/13/07   Page 5 of 8\nThe Court has reviewed the remaining objected-to requests and concludes that these requests are \nrelevant to the claims asserted by Meza or to the defenses asserted by Livingston or Collier.  The \nCourt does not find these requests to fall outside the scope of appropriate discovery.  Noting that \nLivingston and Collier do not dispute Meza's contention that only twelve parolees are housed at the \nTravis County Correctional Complex (\"TCCC\") each month, the Court concludes that the requests \nregarding all parolees at TCCC since September 1, 2002, will not unduly burden Livingston and \nCollier.  The requests \"appear[]  reasonably calculated to  lead to the discovery of admissible \nevidence.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). \nThe Court acknowledges that Interrogatories 1 and 2 in Meza's Second Set of Discovery \nRequests to Livingston in his official capacity request information that is quite broad in scope. \nHowever, these interrogatories, regarding all releasees from TDC] custody since September 1,2002, \nwho  were  previously  convicted for  murder or  sexual  assault,  are  not \"overly broad.\"  The \ninterrogatories are limited in scope by the years for which data is requested and by the types of \noffenses for which the releasees were convicted.  The interrogatories request basic, statistical \ninformation on each releasee, of the type that may be readily available to Livingston and is likely \nrelevant to Meza's equal-protection claims that he is treated differently from other TDC] parolees \nbased on Defendants' improper motives.  The Court further notes that Livingston did not timely \nrespond to Meza's motion to compel answers to these specific interrogatories, allowing the Court \nto grant Meza's motion to compel responses to these interrogatories as unopposed.  See W.D. Tex. \nLocal R. CV -7( d) (requiring party opposed to motion to respond within eleven days of service of \nmotion and allowing district court to grant motion as unopposed if no timely response is filed). \nLivingston and Collier's objections on the grounds that Meza's requests for discovery are \"overly \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 211   Filed 06/13/07   Page 6 of 8\nbroad, unduly burdensome, and harassing and not reasonably limited in scope and time ... irrelevant \nand not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\" will therefore be \noverruled. \nPrivileges Claimed by Livingston and Collier \nLivingston and Collier oppose several of Meza' s discovery requests on the basis that they \nrequest information that is confidential and privileged under a Texas statute protecting parole files \nfrom discovery.  See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. ยง 508.313(a) (West 2004).  Livingston and Collier's \nobjection relates to Interrogatories 1 and 3 and Requests for Production 1, 2, and 5 of the First Set \nof Discovery Requests to Collier in his individual capacity;  Interrogatory 1 and Requests for \nProduction 1 and 2 of the First Set of Discovery Requests to Defendants in their official capacities; \nand to Interrogatories 1 and 2 and Request for Production 1 of the Second Set of Discovery Requests \nto Livingston. \nLivingston and Collier further object to parts of Interrogatory 3 to Meza's First Set of \nDiscovery Requests to Collier in his individual capacity and to Interrogatories 1 and 2 to Meza's \nSecond Set of Discovery Requests to Livingston on the grounds that Meza' s interrogatories request \ninformation that is confidential and privileged under a Texas statute protecting criminal-history \nrecords.  See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. ยง 411.083 (West 2004). \nThe Court has received Livingston and Collier's privilege logs claiming that the parole-file \nprivilege protects the majority of the documents requested by Meza in his motions to compel.  The \nCourt will set a hearing on the issue of whether the aforementioned privileges protect the information \nsought by Meza in his discovery requests. The parties shall present evidence and argument as to the \ninterests protected by the statutory privileges, and the relevance and necessity of the requested \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 211   Filed 06/13/07   Page 7 of 8\ndocuments to Meza's claims.

After \nconsidering the parties' pleadings and other filings, the relevant case law, and the case file, the \nMagistrate Court signed a Report and Recommendation on June 5, 2007 (Clerk's Document 207), \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 238   Filed 06/25/07   Page 2 of 3\nrecommending that this Court grant Owens's and Aliseda, Davis, Denoyelles, Aycock, Garcia, and \nGonzales's (\"Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendants\"') motions to dismiss as to Meza's \nclaims under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIP A\" claims), and that \nthe motions be denied in all other respects.  The Magistrate Judge further recommended that \nCollier's motion to dismiss be granted as to Meza's RLUIP A claims and denied in all other respects. \nA party may  serve  and  file  specific, written objections to  the proposed findings  and \nrecommendations of the Magistrate Judge within ten (10) days after being served with a copy of the \nReport and Recommendation, and thereby secure a de novo review by the district court.  28 U.S.C. \nยง 636(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).  A party's failure to timely file written objections to the proposed \nfindings, conclusions, and recommendations in a Report and Recommendation bars that party, except \nupon grounds of plain error, from attacking on appeal the unobjected-to proposed factual findings \nand legal conclusions accepted by the District Court.  See Douglass v.  United Services Auto Ass 'n, \n79 FJd 1415 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc). \nThe parties in this case were properly notified of the consequences of a failure to file \nobjections, which were due June 20, 2007.  Meza did not file objections to the findings of fact and \nconclusions of law in the report and recommendation; rather, Meza states that he is unopposed to \nthe dismissal of his RLUIPA's claims in light of the Magistrate Judge's recommendation.  Collier \nhas also failed to timely file objections to the Report and Recommendation.  Having reviewed the \nReport and Recommendation along with the record in this case and finding no plain error, the Court \naccepts the Report and Recommendation for the reasons stated therein as to dismissal of Meza' s \nRLUIP A claims and denial in part of Collier's motion to dismiss. \nTexas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendants timely filed objections to the Magistrate's \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 238   Filed 06/25/07   Page 3 of 3\nJudge's Report and Recommendations (Clerk's Documents 212).  After a de novo review of the \nrecord as to the issues raised by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Defendants, see Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 72(a), and having considered the objections and the applicable law, this Court is of the opinion \nthat the Report and Recommendation should be approved and accepted for the reasons stated therein \nas to denial in part of Owens's and Aliseda, Davis, Denoyelles, Aycock, Garcia, and Gonzales's \nmotions to dismiss. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Owens, Aliseda, Davis, Denoyelles, Aycock, Garcia, \nand Gonzales's Objections to the Report and Recommendation of the United Magistrate Judge are \nOVERRULED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the United States Magistrate Judge's Report and \nRecommendation (Clerk's Document 207) is hereby APPROVED AND ACCEPTED. \nIT IS ORDERED that Collier's Third Motion to Dismiss (Clerk's Document 162) is \nGRANTED IN PART as to Meza's RLUIP A claims.

Today the Court rendered \nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in this cause, granting Plaintiff Raul Meza his requested \nMeza originally sued Bryan Collier, the former Director of the Texas Department of Criminal \n1 \nJustice Parole Division.  The Court granted Defendants Brad Livingston and Collier's motion to \nsubstitute Jenkins for Collier on November 10,2008 (Clerk's Document 334). \nMeza originally sued Linda Garcia, in her official capacity as a member of the Texas Board of \n2 \nPardons and Paroles.  The Court granted the Board members' motion to substitute Lorraine for \nGarcia on November 10, 2008 (Clerk's Document 334). \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 355    Filed 03/24/09   Page 2 of 4\ndeclaratory and injunctive reliefto the extent that Defendants Brad Livingston, as Executive Director \nof the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Stuart Jenkins, as Director of the Texas Department \nof Criminal Justice Parole Division (collectively, \"the Department\"); and Defendants Rissie L. \nOwens, Jose Aliseda, Charles Aycock, Conrith Davis, Jackie DeNoyelles, Barbara Lorraine, and \nJuanita M. Gonzales, as members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (collectively, \"the \nBoard\"), acting as the State of Texas, (the \"State\") must afford Meza due process as required by \nColeman v. Dretke, 395 FJd 216 (5th Cir. 2004).  The Court dismissed Meza's remaining claims \nwithout prejudice. \nIn his Original Complaint, Meza sued Livingston, in his official capacity; Brian Collier, in \nhis official and individual capacities; Travis County; Greg Hamilton, as Sheriff of Travis County; \nand parole officers in their official and individual capacities. In addition to his constitutional claims, \nMeza also brought a claim against Hamilton under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act of 2000 (\"RLUIPA\").  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc, et seq. (2003). \nOn November 17,2006, the Court granted the relevant parties' voluntary motion to dismiss \nthe claims between Meza,  Travis County, and Hamilton (Clerk's Document 49).  The  Court \ndismissed the claims for monetary damages against Livingston and Collier in their official capacities \non December 6,2006 (Clerk's Document 52). \nIn his Third Amended Complaint (Clerk's Document 96), Meza added the Board members \nas Defendants, alleged RLUIP A claims against the Department and Board Defendants, and dropped \nhis claims against the individual parole officers.  Meza stipulated to dismissal without prejudice of \nhis individual-capacity claims against Collier on June 15,2007 (Clerk's Document 218). The Court \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 355    Filed 03/24/09   Page 3 of 4\ndismissed Meza's RLUIPA claims against the Department and Board Defendants on June 25,2007 \n(Clerk's Document 238). \nSeeing that no matters remain pending in this cause, the Court renders the following final \njudgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. \nIT IS ORDERED that all claims asserted between Meza, Travis County, and Hamilton are \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Meza' s claims for monetary damages against Livingston \nand Collier in their official capacities are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Meza' s claims against Collier in his individual capacity \nare DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED Meza's RLUIP A claims against the Department and Board \nare DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nTHE COURT FURTHER DECLARES that the State failed to afford Meza \"a hearing \nmeeting the requirements of due process\" when it imposed sex-offender conditions on his parole. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the State shall provide Meza with an appropriate hearing \nregarding imposition of sex-offender conditions on his parole consistent with the Court's Findings \nof Fact and Conclusions of Law rendered this day. \nIT  IS  FURTHER ORDERED  that Meza's equal-protection and  due-process  claims \nregarding  his  other formal  and  informal  conditions  of parole  are  DISMISSED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE. \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 355    Filed 03/24/09   Page 4 of 4\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Meza is awarded costs for the prosecution of this cause. \nMeza's request for  attorney's fees  is  DISMISSED WITHOUT  PREJUDICE  to  refiling  in \naccordance with the Local Rule CV-7(i) of the Local Rules of the Western District of Texas. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all relief not expressly granted is DENIED. \nIT IS FINALLY ORDERED that this cause is CLOSED. \n~ \nSIGNED this  day of March, 2009. \n4 ",

A-05-CA-I008-LY \nBRAD LIVINGSTON, EXECUTIVE  ยง \nDIRECTOR OF THE TEXAS  ยง \nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL  ยง \nJUSTICE, IN HIS OFFICIAL  ยง \nCAPACITY; STUART JENKINS,  ยง \nDIRECTOR OF THE TEXAS  ยง \nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL  ยง \nJUSTICE PAROLE DIVISION, IN HIS  ยง \nOFFICIAL CAPACITY; AND RISSIE L.  ยง \nOWENS, JOSE ALISEDA, CHARLES  ยง \nAYCOCK, CONRITH DAVIS, JACKIE  ยง \nDENOYELLES, BARBARA LORRAINE,  ยง \nAND JUANITA GONZALES, IN THEIR  ยง \nOFFICIAL CAPACITIES AS MEMBERS  ยง \nOF THE TEXAS BOARD OF PARDONS  ยง \nAND PAROLE,  ยง \nDEFENDANTS.  ยง \nORDER \nBefore the Court in the above styled and numbered cause is Plaintiff s Second Motion for \nEnforcement of Judgment filed June 13,2011 (Clerk's Document No. 444); Defendants Owens, \nAliseda, Aycock, Davis, Denoyelles, Garcia and Gonzales' Response to Plaintiffs Second Motion \nfor Enforcement of Judgment filed June 29, 2011 (Clerk's Document No. 448); and Plaintiff s Reply \nto Defendants' Response to Second Motion for Enforcement of Judgment filed July 6, 2011 (Clerk's \nDocument No. 449).  Having reviewed the motion, response, reply, as well as all evidence and the \nfile in this case, the Court determines that Plaintiffs motion should be denied. \nOn March 24,2009, this Court ordered the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (the \"Board\") \nto provide Plaintiff Raul Meza a hearing with the following due process protections: (1) written \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 450   Filed 08/24/11   Page 2 of 4\nnotice in advance of the hearing; (2) disclosure of the evidence on which the State is relying; (3) a \nhearing, scheduled sufficiently after the notice to permit Meza to prepare, at which he will have the \nopportunity to be heard in person, represented by counsel, and to present documentary evidence in \nhis support; (4) an opportunity at the hearing to call witnesses and confront and cross examine state \nwitnesses, 'except upon a finding, not arbitrarily made, of good cause for not permitting each as to \na particular witness'; (5) an independent decision maker; and, at issue here, (6) a written statement \nby the fact-finder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the decision.  Specifically, the \nCourt found the record in this case was utterly devoid of findings regarding Meza and rejected the \nBoard's argument that the continued imposition of sex-offender conditions constituted a sufficient \nfinding that Meza possessed the offensive characteristic of lack of sexual control for the basis for \nsuch finding.  On May 20, 2010, the Fifth Circuit affirmed these findings and conclusions, only \ndisagreeing with this Court's finding that the State is required to provide counsel to Meza. \nAfter the Fifth Circuit's ruling, a hearing was conducted by the Board on June 4, 2010.  On \nJune 25, 2010, the panel voted unanimously in a one-page notice to continue Meza's sex-offender \nconditions. The findings were a single sentence: \"Raul Meza constitutes a threat to society by reason \nof his lack of sexual control.\"  On August 20,2010, \nOn November 19,2010, Meza filed a motion for enforcement of judgment and contempt \nagainst Defendants, requesting, in part, that the Court enforce its judgment that the Board provide \nthe required written statement by the fact-finder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for \nthe decision.  On March 29,2011, the Court held a hearing on Meza's motion.  After reviewing the \nmotion, the evidence, all briefing submitted by the parties, and the arguments of counsel at the \nhearing, the Court found that the Board decision of June 25, 2010, did not comply with this Court's \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 450   Filed 08/24/11   Page 3 of 4\nOrder of March 24, 2009, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  The Court found the Board's \ndecision was not a written statement by the fact-finder as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons \nfor the decision in that it contained neither reasons for the decision nor evidence relied upon.  On \nMarch 30, 2011, the Court ordered the Board to prepare a new written statement that set out with \nspecificity the evidence presented to the Board that was persuasive to the Board in its decision and \nthe specific reasons for its decision to continue Meza's sex-offender conditions. On April 28, 2011, \nthe Board issued an additional written statement.  Unlike the prior written statement, which was a \none-page notice with a one-sentence summary of the Board's findings, the Apri128, 2011 statement \ndetails the proceedings of the June 4, 2010 hearing, identifies the witnesses who testified and \nevidence considered in the Board's decision, lists specific findings of fact made by the Board, and \nidentifies specific evidence the Board relied upon to make its findings. \nBy his  current motion,  Meza again argues that the written statement is  insufficient. \nSpecifically, Meza contends he was not provided with a therapist's notes prior to her testimony at \nhis hearing and was not notified that she would testify, that some statements by Meza presented at \nthe hearing as evidence were compelled in violation ofMeza' s Fifth Amendment rights, and that the \nBoard's conclusion was not supported by sufficient evidence. Meza asks the Court to appoint a third \nparty to review the record of the hearing, make the required findings, and author the required written \nstatement at the Board's expense.  Meza also requests attorney's fees and costs associated with the \npreparation of his motion. \nThe Court, after reviewing the motion, response, reply, as well as all evidence and the file \nin this case, finds that the Board has sufficiently complied with this Court's Order of March 30, \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 450   Filed 08/24/11   Page 4 of 4\n2011. Likewise, the Court finds that the Board has sufficiently complied with this Court's Order of \nMarch 24, 2009. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs Second Motion for Enforcement of \nJudgment filed June 13,2011 (Clerk's Document No. 444) is DENIED. \nkltl, \nSIGNED this  of August, 2011. \n4 ",

Pending in this cause are \nDefendant Livingston and Collier's Motion for Summary Judgment with Brief in Support filed \nMarch 14,2007 (Clerk's Document 109), Defendant Collier's Motion for Summary Judgment with \nBrief in Support filed March 14,2007 (Clerk's Document 110), and Plaintiff Meza's Motion for \nPartial Swnmary Judgment filed March 14,2007 (Clerk's Document 112), which this Court referred \nto United States Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin for report and recommendation on May 1,2007 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 305   Filed 10/22/08   Page 2 of 3\n(Clerk's Document 157).  See 28 U.S.c. ยง 636(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72; Loc. R. W.D. Tex. App. C, \nl(d).  It is ORDERED that the referral of such motions to Magistrate Judge Austin is hereby \nWITHDRAWN. \nCollier's above-referenced motion for summary judgment pertains to Meza's claims against \nhim in his individual capacity. On June 15,2007, Plaintiff Raul Meza and Defendants stipulated to \nthe dismissal of Meza's claims against Defendant Brian Collier in his individual capacity (Clerk's \nDocument 218).  The Court therefore DISMISSES Collier's Motion for Summary Judgment with \nBrief in Support (Clerk's Document 110). \nAlso pending before the Court are Defendants'  Opposed Joint Motion to Stay Pretrial \nHearing and Trial Setting with Brief in Support filed  June  5,  2007 (Clerk's Document 206), \nDefendants' Opposed Joint Motion to Stay Compliance with Local Rule CV -16( e) with Brief in \nSupport filed June 15, 2007 (Clerk's Document 213), Defendants' Opposed Second Motion to Stay \nPretrial Hearing and Trial Setting with Brief in Support filed June 19,2007 (Clerk's Document 225), \nand Defendants Owens, Aliseda, Davis, Denoyelles, Aycock, Garcia, and Gonzales' Motion to \nCancel the Trial Setting and Motion to Issue New Scheduling Order filed June 25, 2007 (Clerk's \nDocument 240).  Such motions pertain to the Court's final-pretrial-conference setting on June 26, \n2007, and related requirements, and are therefore moot.  The motions are hereby DISMISSED. \nAlso pending before the Court is Plaintiff s Daubert Challenge to Defendants'  Expert \nDesignation filed June 21, 2007 (Clerk's Document 233).  By his motion, Meza asks the Court to \nexclude the testimony of Vivian Heine or her designee.  Livingston and Collier would have been \nrequired to file a response to such motion on or before July 2, 2007, but filed their notice of \ninterlocutory appeal on June 22, 2007, before the response time had run. See Loc. R. W.D. Tex.

To date, Defendants \nhave not filed a response to Meza's motion to exclude Vivian Heine's testimony, and the Court may \ntherefore grant the motion as unopposed.  See  id  (allowing district court to  grant motion as \nunopposed if no timely response is filed).  Plaintiffs Daubert Challenge to Defendants' Expert \nDesignation (Clerk's Document 233) is therefore GRANTED as unopposed. \nZ/f! \nSIGNED this  day of October, 2008. \n3 ",

Pursuant to  42 U.S.C.  ยง  1983, Defendants have,  without due process of law, \nimposed conditions upon Plaintiff Meza's incarceration that are qualitatively different from the \npunishment typically imposed on other parolees at the Del Valle facility,  in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n3.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Mr. Meza claims that Defendant individual parole \nofficers violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by imposing additional infonnal, \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 2 of 9\nunauthorized conditions on his confinement without due process oflaw. \n4.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Mr. Meza claims that policy and custom of the \nTCCC's Del Valle facility, described herein, resulted in violations of his Fourteenth Amendment \ndue process rights. \n5.  Mr. Meza seeks damages, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and \ncosts as a result of Defendants' violations. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343. \n7.  Further, Defendants' actions and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Del \nValle, Texas.  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง1391, venue is proper for this Court. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff is confined at the TCCC facility in Del Valle. \n9.  Defendant Sheriff of Travis County can be served with process through 501 W. 11th \nStreet, Austin, TX 78701.  He is responsible for the operation of the TCCC facility in Del Valle. \n10.  Defendant Brad Livingston is the executive director of the Texas Department of \nCriminal Justice (\"TDCJ\"). \n11.  Defendant Brian Collier is the director of the TDCJ Parole Division. \n12.  In all the actions described herein, Defendant parole officers, Defendant Collier and \nDefendant Livingston (\"TDCJ Defendants\") each were acting under color of law and pursuant to \nlegal authority.  Defendant parole officers and Defendant Collier are each sued in their official \nand individual capacities; Defendant Livingston is sued only in his official capacity. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n13.  On or about March 8, 1982, Plaintiff pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to \nthirty (30) years imprisonment in Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facilities. \n2 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 3 of 9\n14.  On or about September 8, 1989, Plaintiffwas sentenced to four (4) additional years \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively to the thirty (30) year term, for possession of a deadly \nweapon in a penal institution. \n15.  TDC] released Plaintiff to the custody of Defendant Sheriff of Travis County on or \nabout  September  25,  2002,  on  \"mandatory  supervision.\"  Plaintiffs  release  on  mandatory \nsupervision was required by statute because his calendar time served plus \"good time\" credits \naccumulated totaled the maximum length of his sentence.  See Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. 42.18(8)(c) \n(1987). \n16.  Mandatory supervision is \"the release of a prisoner from imprisonment, but not on \nparole, and not from the legal custody of the state, for rehabilitation outside prison walls under \nsuch conditions and provisions for disciplinary supervision as the board may determine.\"  Tex. \nCrim. Pro. Art. 42.18(2)(b) (1987).  The purpose of mandatory supervision is \"to aid all prisoners \nto readjust to society upon completion of their period of incarceration.\"  Tex. Crim. Pro. Art. \n42.18(1) (1987). \n17.  Parolees on mandatory supervision at TCCC are allowed to search for a job in the \ncommunity and to leave the facility to work when they have secured employment.  The parolees \nthen return to the facility at night. \n18.  Defendants have not allowed Plaintiff the same opportunities as other parolees. \nThey have placed him on \"lock down\"  status since his  arrival at TCCC  in 2002,  and have \nconfined him in the jail most of the time.  Other parolees are not on perpetual \"lock down\" status \nand  may  leave  the jail with  considerably  greater  freedom.  Other parolees  are  allowed  to \nformulate a weekly schedule of activities outside of the jail, such as doctors' appointments, job \ninterviews, visits to the Department of Public Safety to obtain driver's licenses, etc.  Mr. Meza is \nroutinely denied these same opportunities. \n3 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 4 of 9\n19.  Mr. Meza has made numerous good faith attempts to secure employment, but \nDefendant parole officers have  thwarted him.  Since  about  June of 2004,  Defendants have \nallowed Plaintiff only five hours per week of time at Project RIO (Reintegration of Offenders), \nthe parolee employment search program.  They allow other parolees virtually unlimited time at \nProject RIO.  Prior to  June  2004, Defendants did not allow Mr.  Meza any access to  these \nresources. \n20.  Before Mr. Meza can interview for  a job, employment opportunities must be \nscreened by Defendant parole officers to ensure that potential employment locations meet the \nconditions of his mandatory supervision.  Defendant parole officers habitually delay in screening \nthe potential employers that Plaintiff has located, causing the identified positions to be filled \nbefore Mr.  Meza has  the  opportunity to  interview  for  them.  Other Teee parolees do  not \nexperience these chronic delays in their job searches. \n21.  On the rare occasion when Mr. Meza is able to secure a job interview, several \narmed guards accompany him to the interview.  On or about November 3, 2004, Mr. Meza had a \njob interview with Southern Education, and armed guards escorted him there.  Unsurprisingly, \nPlaintiff was  unable  to  secure  employment  under  these  conditions.  Armed  guards  do  not \naccompany other Teee parolees to job interviews. \n22.  Defendants have also told Mr. Meza that, should he find a job, an armed parole \nofficer will have to go to the job site with him every day.  Potential employers have told Mr. \nMeza they cannot hire him for this reason.  Other parolees do not face this additional obstacle. \n23.  Because Defendants' actions have prevented him from securing a job, Mr. Meza's \nliberty is considerably more restricted than other parolees on mandatory supervision at Teee. \nDefendants allow other parolees to leave the facility and work in the community. \n24.  Mr.  Meza has been denied educational opportunities that  are offered to  other \n4 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 5 of 9\nparolees at TCCC.  Mr. Meza has not been allowed to attend computer orientation classes, job \nsearch classes and resume writing classes offered to other parolees at TCCC.  Mr. Meza has only \nbeen allowed to attend three one-day seminars offered at Project RIO, and even then has been \npulled out of the classes in the middle of the seminars because he is only allowed two and a half \nhours twice a week at Project RIO. \n25.  Denying Mr. Meza these educational opportunities also has negatively impacted \nhis job search and thus unduly restrained his liberty.  For example, in order to take full advantage \nof the limited amount of time he has access to Project RIO, Mr. Meza needs effective computer \nskills.  Due to his long incarceration and Defendants' refusal to allow him the same educational \nopportunities they offer other parolees, Plaintiff has been unable to develop these necessary skills \nalong with other parolees. \n26.  Mr. Meza has not been allowed to obtain a driver's license, a privilege allowed to \nother parolees  at  TCCC.  Without  a driver's  license,  certain employment  opportunities  are \nunavailable to Mr. Meza (such as auto repair positions).  Mr. Meza has been denied employment \nby auto repair facilities because he does not have a driver's license. \n27.  Defendants have not afforded Mr. Meza any due process of law to justify his \ndisparate treatment at TCCC.  No conditions of Plaintiffs mandatory supervision justify this \ndisparate treatment. \n28.  On February 23, 2005, Mr. Meza received a notice informing him that TDCJ was \nreimposing sex offender conditions on his parole, and that he had one month to respond.  Mr. \nMeza promptly filed a response.  This notice was never served on his attorneys, who TDCJ knew \nrepresented him, in violation of Rule 4.02(a) of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional \nConduct. \n29.  TDCJ ignored Mr. Meza's response, and imposed sex offender conditions on his \n5 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 6 of 9\nparole without affording him due process, in violation of the holding of Coleman v. Dretke, 395 \nFJd 216 (5th Cir. 2004).  Mr. Meza's attorneys contacted TDCJ regarding this abuse of due \nprocess, and were ignored.  The sex offender conditions remain imposed on Mr. Meza's parole. \n30.  Mr. Meza is a Christian.  His religious faith is sincere and heartfelt, and assisted his \nefforts to rehabilitate himself. \n31.  In order to attend worship services at the TCCC, Defendants require inmates to \ndress in prison uniforms.  Plaintiff finds this requirement demeans his religious activities, and \nacts as a substantial burden on his religious exercise.  Other parolees are allowed to leave the jail \nto attend worship services.  Mr. Meza is forced to attend services with inmates at the jail instead \nof in the community, like other parolees. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nI.  Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIP A\") \n32.  Mr. Meza alleges a cause of action because agents of Travis. County prohibit him \nfrom  attending  religious  services  unless  he  dons  a prison  uniform.  Similarly,  the  TDC] \nDefendants do  not allow Mr.  Meza to attend worship services in the community,  like other \nparolees.  Defendants' actions and policies impose substantial burdens on Mr. Meza's religious \nfreedom. \n33.  Under RLUIP A, \"no government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious \nexercise of a person residing in or confined to  an  institution\"  unless  the burden  furthers  a \n\"compelling governmental interest,\" and does so by \"the least restrictive means.\"  42 U.S.C.  ยงยง \n2000cc-l(a)(I)-(2).  A religious exercise is any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled \nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000cc-5(7)(A). \n34.  The Act covers government-run institutions, including jails and transitional facilities. \nTeCC  falls  under  RLUIP A's  definition  of government,  and,  therefore,  is  responsible  for \n6 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 7 of 9\naccommodating Mr. Meza's religious beliefs. \nII.  Section 1983 \n35.  The TDCJ Defendants impose qualitatively different conditions of confinement upon \nMr. Meza.  The Travis County Defendants enforce these conditions.  The informal imposition of \nthese additional conditions upon Mr. Meza alone violate his due process rights. \n36.  The TDCJ Defendants enforce informal restrictions on Mr. Meza's liberty that have \nnot been justified by due process.  They habitually treat Mr. Meza differently from other parolees \non mandatory supervision so as to deny Mr. Meza the opportunities afforded to others. \n37.  The TDCJ Defendants have imposed sex offender conditions on Mr. Meza's parole \nwithout providing him due process, in violation oflaw and his Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nDAMAGES \n38.  Mr.  Meza  is  entitled  to  compensatory  relief from  all  Defendants,  jointly and \nseverally, for lost wages and loss ofliberty. \n39.  Plaintiff also seeks punitive damages from the TDCJ Defendants. \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n40.  Mr. Meza seeks declaratory judgment to vindicate his rights under Section 1983 and \nRLUIP A with respect to Defendants' violations. \n41.  Mr. Meza is entitled to declaratory judgment concerning Defendants' violations of \nhis due process rights. \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n42.  Mr. Meza seeks injunctive relief, permanently enjoining Defendants from: \na.  Failing to  reasonably accommodate his  religious  exercise,  including requiring \nparolees to wear jail uniforms in order to attend worship services and imposing \nworship service policies not serving a compelling governmental interest; and, \nb.  Continuing  to  subject  Mr.  Meza  to  qualitatively  different  conditions  of \n7 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 8 of 9\nconfinement without due process of law; and, \nc.  Imposing sex offender conditions upon his parole without due process oflaw. \n43.  Inasmuch as Defendants have acted in the events described herein, they will continue \nto act accordingly.  Without injunctive relief, Defendants will continue their outrageous conduct, \nthereby unduly limiting Mr. Meza's liberty without due process. \nATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS \n44.  Mr. Meza is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation costs, and court costs, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE, Mr. Meza respectfully prays that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Enter judgment on his behalf against the TDCJ Defendants in their individual \ncapacities  and  the  Travis  County Sheriff, jointly and  severally,  for  monetary \ndamages sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for his lost wages; \nB.  Issue declaratory relief that Defendants' conduct constituted illegal deprivation of \nPlaintiffs due process rights; \nC.  Order injunctive relief against Defendant Travis County Sheriff to end further \nprevention of the exercise of religious freedom of Plaintiff and TCCe parolees to \nprohibit the violation of Mr. Meza's rights under RLUIP A; \nD.  Grant reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and court costs; and \nE.  Grant all other and additional relief to which Mr. Meza may be entitled, at law or \nin equity. \nDATED: June ~ j  ,2006 \nRespectfully Submitted, \nJames C.
