This lawsuit is about one of America’s most cherished freedoms: the freedom to \npractice one’s religion without government interference.  It is not about whether people have a \nright to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception.  Those services are freely \navailable in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them \nmore widely available.  Here, however, the U.S. Government seeks to require The Roman \nCatholic Diocese of Dallas1 (“Plaintiff,” “Diocese of Dallas,” or the “Diocese”) to violate its \nsincerely held religious beliefs by providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to those \n                                                 \n1 The Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas is a nonprofit religious organization organized and existing according to \nthe Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and recognized by the State of Texas.  The Diocese is a \nRoman Catholic religious entity under the pastoral care of Bishop Kevin J. Farrell, D.D. \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 2 of 47   PageID 2\nservices.  American history and tradition, embodied in the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), safeguard religious entities \nfrom such overbearing and oppressive governmental action.  Plaintiff therefore seeks relief in \nthis Court to protect this most fundamental of American rights. \n2.  Since the founding of this country, religious organizations such as Plaintiff have \nbeen free to fulfill their religious beliefs through service to the underprivileged and underserved.  \nAs a result, the Diocese currently serves thousands of people whom the Government does not or \ncannot serve.  Without Plaintiff’s assistance, many of the recipients of Plaintiff’s services would \nbe without shelter, food, prenatal health, medical care, and vital educational opportunities.  \nPlaintiff is compelled by its religious beliefs to provide these services.  Plaintiff is also \ncompelled by its religious beliefs to avoid the provision of abortion-inducing drugs and the \nfacilitation of sterilization services and contraception.  But the U.S. Government has now \npromulgated regulations that attempt to force Plaintiff to violate its religious beliefs by either \nscaling back its social service or violating its beliefs on the sanctity of life.  This government \ninterference with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs violates the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \n3.  The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes protect religious organizations from \ngovernmental interference with their religious views—particularly minority religious views.  The \nConstitution and federal law thus stand as a bulwark against oppressive government actions even \nif supported by a majority of citizens.  This “wall of separation between church and state” is \ncritical to the preservation of religious freedom.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[t]he \nstructure of our government has, for the preservation of civil liberty, rescued the temporal \ninstitutions from religious interference.  On the other hand, it has secured religious liberty from \nthe invasion of civil authority.” \n  2 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 3 of 47   PageID 3\n4.  The Government is now attacking Plaintiff’s religious liberties.  Current Federal \nlaw described below (the “U.S. Government Mandate”) requires religious organizations such as \nPlaintiff to violate their centuries’ old teachings on the sanctity of human life by providing \ncoverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization services, contraception, and related \ncounseling services.  The Government has not shown any compelling need to force religious \norganizations to provide coverage for these services, and in fact, has chosen to make exemptions \nto the law both for religious and non-religious reasons.  If the Government can force religious \ninstitutions to violate their beliefs in such a manner, there is no apparent limit to the \nGovernment’s power to interfere with the free practice of one’s religious beliefs. \n5.  Such trampling of religious freedom violates Plaintiff’s clearly established federal \nconstitutional and statutory rights.  The First Amendment also prohibits the Government from \nbecoming excessively entangled in religious affairs and from interfering with a religious \ninstitution’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, or \ndoctrine.  The U.S. Government Mandate tramples all of these rights. \nBACKGROUND \n6.  Plaintiff is a Catholic religious entity that provides a wide range of spiritual, \neducational, and social services to the greater Dallas community and surrounding counties, \nserving Catholics and non-Catholics alike.  The Diocese not only provides pastoral care and \nspiritual guidance for over 1 million Catholics, but also educates close to 12,000 students \nthrough the Diocesan school system and meets many other needs through the numerous \ncharitable programs undertaken by the parishes within the Diocese.  For example, Bishop Dunne \nCatholic School—a school within the Diocese—is devoted to teaching a religiously and \n  3 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 4 of 47   PageID 4\nethnically diverse student body with a significant number of children from families with limited \nfinancial resources. \n7.  Plaintiff serves many people, regardless of faith or financial condition.  Cardinal \nJames Hickey, retired Archbishop of Washington, once commented on the role of Catholic \neducators:  “We do not educate our students because they are Catholic; we educate them because \nwe are Catholic.”  Bishop Farrell echoed this sentiment regarding the emphasis Catholic \neducators must place on serving the needs of those less fortunate:  “In the end, one’s life is not \njudged by what one acquires but what one does with it.  Catholic education calls on the student \nto model his or her life after the One who ‘came to serve, not be served.’”  Most Reverend Kevin \nJ. Farrell, D.D., Catholic Schools Week (Jan. 19, 2012), available at \nhttp://bishopkevinfarrell.org/blog/2012/01/catholic-schools-week-2/ (last visited Apr. 17, 2012). \n8.  Plaintiff’s work is guided by and consistent with Roman Catholic belief, including \nthe requirement that it serve those in need, regardless of their religion or financial condition.  \nThis is perhaps best captured by words attributed to St. Francis of Assisi: “Preach the Gospel at \nall times.  Use words if necessary.”  As Pope Benedict has more recently put it, “Love for \nwidows and orphans, prisoners, and the sick and needy of every kind, is as essential to her [the \nCatholic Church] as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the Gospel.  The Church \ncannot neglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the \nWord.”  Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est ¶ 22 (2006).  Thus, Catholic individuals and \norganizations consistently work to create a more just community by serving any and all \nneighbors in need. \n9.  Artificial interference with the creation of life, including through abortion-inducing \ndrugs, sterilization, and contraceptives, is contrary to Catholic values and beliefs. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 5 of 47   PageID 5\n10.  Defendants have promulgated various rules (collectively, the “U.S. Government \nMandate”), that force Plaintiff to violate its sincerely held religious beliefs.  Under the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, many Catholic and other religious organizations are required to provide \nhealth plans to employees that include and/or facilitate coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, \nsterilization, and contraception in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs.  Ignoring \nbroader religious exemptions from other federal laws, the Government has crafted a narrow \nexemption to this Mandate for certain “religious employers” who can convince the Government \nthat they satisfy four criteria: \n●  “The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization”; \n \n●  “The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization”; \n \n●  “The organization primarily serves persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization”; and \n \n●  “The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) \nand section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended.” \nThus, in order to safeguard their religious freedoms, religious employers must plead with \ngovernment bureaucrats for a determination that the employers are sufficiently “religious.” \n11. The Diocese does not know whether the Government will conclude that it satisfies \nthe definition of a “religious employer” under the impermissibly vague terms of the exemption.  \nThis narrow definition of “religious employer” could be read to exclude the Diocese even though \nit is a “religious” organization under any reasonable definition of the term.  And in order for \nPlaintiff to learn whether or not it qualifies, it must submit to an intrusive and potentially costly \ngovernmental investigation into whether, in the Government’s view, the Plaintiff’s “purpose” is \nthe “inculcation of religious values”; whether it “primarily” employs “persons who share [its] \nreligious tenets,” even though it hires many Catholics and non-Catholics; and whether it \n  5 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 6 of 47   PageID 6\n“primarily” serves such people, even though its schools, parishes, and social services include \nindividuals of all faiths. \n12. Consequently, even to attempt to qualify for the exemption directly, Plaintiff may be \nrequired to stop providing educational opportunities to non-Catholics, to stop serving non-\nCatholics, to fire non-Catholic employees, and to cease hiring non-Catholic persons—actions \nthat would betray its religious commitment to serving all in need without regard to religious \nbelief.  Plaintiff’s only other options are to violate its own beliefs and teachings or to disobey the \nU.S. Government Mandate. \n13. The U.S. Government Mandate, including the exemption for certain “religious \nemployers,” is irreconcilable with the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \nand other laws.  The Government has not shown any compelling need to force Plaintiff to \nprovide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and \ncontraception, or for requiring Plaintiff to submit to an intrusive governmental examination of its \nreligious missions and related services.  The Government also has not shown that the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate is narrowly tailored to advancing any interest in increasing access to these \ndrugs and services, since these services are already widely available and nothing prevents the \nGovernment from making them even more widely available by providing or paying for them \ndirectly through a duly-enacted law.  The Government, therefore, cannot justify its decision to \nforce Plaintiff to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to these drugs and services in violation \nof its sincerely held religious beliefs. \n14.  Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the U.S. Government Mandate \ncannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiff, an injunction barring its enforcement, and an order \nvacating the Mandate. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 7 of 47   PageID 7\nI.  PRELIMINARY MATTERS \n15.  The Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas is a nonprofit religious organization \norganized and existing according to the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and \nrecognized by the State of Texas.  The Diocese includes a community of Roman Catholic \nparishes, schools, and organizations in and around Dallas, Texas, under the pastoral care of Most \nReverend Bishop Kevin J. Farrell, D.D.  The principal office of the Diocese is located in Dallas, \nTexas.  It is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, and educational purposes within the \nmeaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n16.  Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n17.  Defendant Hilda Solis is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.  She is \nsued in her official capacity. \n18.  Defendant Timothy Geithner is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury.  \nHe is sued in his official capacity. \n19.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) is an \nexecutive agency of the United States within the meaning of the RFRA and the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”). \n20.  Defendant U.S. Department of Labor is an executive agency of the United States \nwithin the meaning of the RFRA and the APA. \n21.  Defendant U.S. Department of Treasury is an executive agency of the United \nStates within the meaning of the RFRA and the APA. \n22.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. \n  7 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 8 of 47   PageID 8\n23.  An actual, justiciable controversy currently exists between Plaintiff and \nDefendants.  Absent a declaration resolving this controversy and the validity of the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiff is uncertain as to its rights and duties in planning, negotiating, \nand/or implementing its group health insurance plan, its hiring and retention programs, and its \nsocial, educational, and charitable programs and ministries, as described below. \n24.  Plaintiff has no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the alternative, \nany effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n25.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343(a)(4), and 1346(a)(2). \n26.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n27.  The Diocese of Dallas encompasses 69 parishes and 5 quasi-parishes and serves a \nregion comprised of 9 counties in North Texas, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, \nincluding over 1 million Roman Catholics.  The counties within the Diocese are Collin, Dallas, \nEllis, Fannin, Grayson, Hunt, Kaufman, Navarro, and Rockwall Counties.  Originally covering \n108,000 square miles of Texas—stretching from Texarkana to El Paso, a distance of 812 miles—\nthe Diocese of Dallas was created by Pope Leo XIII in 1890.  In addition to its current 74 \nparishes and quasi-parishes, the Diocese also contains 38 Catholic elementary and secondary \nschools.  The charitable work of the Diocese is also performed through a number of affiliated \ncorporations. \n28.  The Diocese has been led since 2007 by Bishop Kevin J. Farrell, D.D., formerly \nthe Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C.  He is active in the United States \nthrough the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (“USCCB”) and provides leadership for \n  8 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 9 of 47   PageID 9\nvarious initiatives at the national level, including as a consultant to the USCCB Committee on \nMigration. \n29.  Bishop Farrell is assisted in his ministry by two auxiliary bishops and by a staff of \nclergymen, religious brothers and sisters, and lay people.  The Diocese has over 100 employees \nat its Pastoral center, nearly 90 of whom are benefits-eligible. \n30.  The Diocese itself carries out a tripartite spiritual, educational, and social service \nmission, reflecting the several dimensions of its ministry.  The spiritual ministry of the Diocese \nis conducted largely through its parishes.  Through the ministry of its priests, the Diocese \nensures the regular availability of the sacraments to all Catholics living in or visiting the Dallas \narea.  It also provides numerous other opportunities for prayer, worship, and faith formation.  In \naddition to overseeing the sacramental life of its parishes, the Diocese coordinates Catholic \ncampus ministries at University of Dallas and Southern Methodist University, as well as hospital \nministries at 10 hospitals and medical centers within its borders. \n31.  The Catholic educational mission is evident in the Diocesan schools.  The first \nCatholic school opened in Dallas nearly 140 years ago, before the city had a public school \nsystem.  The Diocese’s schools educate diverse student bodies to form Catholic, person-centered \nlearning communities; provide academic excellence through educational programs infused with \nCatholic doctrine and social teachings; serve and support society in the parish, civic, and global \ncommunities; and graduate students who are critical thinkers and productive moral citizens.  The \nschools of the Diocese follow curriculum standards based upon national education standards, \ncore curriculum standards, and the social teachings of the Catholic Church. \n32.  There are 38 Catholic elementary and secondary schools, which educate over \n15,000 students, located within the Diocese.  The Diocese and/or its parishes operate 31 of these \n  9 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 10 of 47   PageID 10\nschools—3 secondary schools and 28 elementary schools—serving over 12,000 students, and \nemploying over 900 teachers in addition to other school staff.  All of these 28 elementary \nschools are “parochial schools,” owned and operated by one of the parishes within the Diocese.  \nThree of the secondary schools operated by the Diocese are incorporated separately from the \nDiocese but are considered “Diocesan schools.”  The remaining three elementary schools and \nfour secondary schools are independent from, but located within, the Diocese and fall under the \nspiritual jurisdiction of Bishop Farrell. \n33.  The Diocesan schools welcome students in all financial conditions, from all \nbackgrounds, and of any or no faith.  In order to make a Catholic education available to as many \nchildren as possible, the Diocese expends substantial funds in tuition assistance programs; it \nawarded over $700,000 in tuition assistance for the 2011–2012 school year.  Fifteen percent of \nthe students in parochial elementary schools are minorities. \n34.  The Catholic educational system has demonstrated a particular dedication to \nteaching the underserved.  For example, Bishop Dunne Catholic School (“Bishop Dunne”), \nlocated in Southwest Dallas, serves a diverse student body which reflects that of the entire Dallas \ncommunity.  Serving children in Dallas proudly for over 110 years, Bishop Dunne has a student \npopulation of approximately 600 students, over 75% of whom are minorities and nearly 50% of \nwhom are not Catholic.  Schools like Bishop Dunne are no less an expression and outgrowth of \ngenuine Catholic belief because they serve a significant number of non-Catholics.  Indeed, quite \nthe opposite: the Diocese sees these schools as a vital part of its mission to offer to every student, \nin every place, a safe, morally sound, and academically rigorous education.  As Bishop Dunne \nrecognizes, “Concern for the poor is at the heart of our educational mission, where we are \ndetermined to provide educational opportunities for as many materially poor students as possible \n  10 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 11 of 47   PageID 11\nand continue to look for new ways to increase our efforts on their behalf.  We work to sensitize \nthe entire school community to the needs of the poor, both locally and globally.  In the 21st \ncentury, this attitude is crucial.  We strive to address the needs of our students who experience \nlearning, personal or social problems.”  Bishop Dunne Catholic School, What We Believe \n(Special Concern for the Poor and Marginalized), available at \nhttp://www.bdhs.org/podium/default.aspx?t=138556 (last visited May 17, 2012).   \n35.  The schools of the Diocese offer a unique educational experience unlike any other \nin the area.  In the words of Bishop Farrell, “Academics is more than the curriculum, it includes \nthe learning environment, the quality of the teaching and how to incorporate one’s educational \nexperience into a Christian value-centered life.  Information is not knowledge and knowledge \nthat is not applied is betrayed.”  Most Reverend Kevin J. Farrell, D.D., Catholic Schools Week \n(Jan. 19, 2012), available at http://bishopkevinfarrell.org/blog/2012/01/catholic-schools-week-2/ \n(last visited Apr. 17, 2012).  To that end, the Diocesan schools have established three priorities \nthat make them stand out from other educational institutions.  Students are taught faith—not just \nthe basics of Christianity, but how to have a relationship with God that will remain with them \nafter they leave their Catholic school.  Service, the giving of one’s time and effort to help others, \nis taught as both a requirement of true faith and good citizenship.  Finally, high academic \nstandards help each student reach his or her potential.  In recent years, many Diocesan schools \nhave received Blue Ribbon recognition from the National Catholic Educational Association.  \nRemarkably, for over a decade, 100% of graduates from Bishop Dunne have achieved \nacceptance for college admission.  Nationally, over 99% of students in Catholic high schools \ngraduate. \n  11 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 12 of 47   PageID 12\n36.  Much of the social service work of the Diocese is performed through its 74 \nparishes and quasi-parishes.  The parishes within the Diocese maintain their own charitable \nefforts, serving the needs of their communities with programs including parish chapters of the St. \nVincent DePaul Society, counseling for youth and adults, English as a second language classes, \nmeals served to the homeless, and visits to nursing homes.  Several parishes in the Diocese \nspread their good works beyond the Dallas community through mission trips to Mexico and \nEcuador, and through several medical and youth missions each year to Trujillo, Honduras.  The \nDiocese oversees all of the social service work undertaken by its parishes.  Neither the Diocese \nnor its parishes keep a tally of persons served through these outreach programs, nor do they ever \nrequest to know the religious affiliation of those served. \n37.  In summary, the Diocese of Dallas, a nonprofit religious organization organized \nand existing according to the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and recognized \nby the State of Texas, has over 100 employees at its Pastoral center, nearly 90 of whom are \nbenefits-eligible.  As noted above, the Diocese includes 31 Diocesan schools and oversees 7 \nother affiliated schools.  These schools serve over 15,000 students, including Catholics and non-\nCatholics alike.  These schools employ approximately 1,300 teachers.  And through its parishes, \nthe Diocese serves an indeterminate number of persons who are homeless, hungry, elderly, or \notherwise in need of material, educational, or other assistance, without regard to religious belief.  \nThe Diocese does not know how many of those whose needs are met through the social service \nprograms of its parishes are Catholic.  In order to determine those statistics, the Diocese would \nbe required to ask the religious affiliation of all individuals that it serves.  That inquiry, however, \nwould substantially burden the Diocese’s exercise of religion. \n  12 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 13 of 47   PageID 13\n38.  It is therefore unclear whether the Government will conclude that the Diocese \nqualifies as a “religious employer” under the narrow exemption from compliance with the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate. \n39.  Moreover, determining whether an organization—such as the Diocese—qualifies \nfor the exemption will require the Government to engage in an intrusive inquiry, based on an \nunderstanding of religion inconsistent with the Catholic faith, into whether, in the view of the \nGovernment, (1) the Diocese’s “purpose” is the “inculcation of religious values,” (2)  the \nDiocese “primarily” employs “persons who share [its] religious tenets,” even though it hires \nmany Catholics and non-Catholics, and (3) the Diocese “primarily” serves such people, even \nthough its schools and social services are open to individuals of all faiths. \n40.  Regardless of outcome, the Diocese strongly objects to such an intrusive and \nmisguided governmental investigation into its religious mission. \n41.  Finally, the Diocese operates a self-insured health plan.  That is, the Diocese does \nnot contract with a separate insurance company that provides health care coverage to its \nemployees.  Instead, the Diocese itself functions as the insurance company underwriting its \nemployees’ medical costs through a plan administered by a Third-Party Administrator, Aetna.   \n42.  The self-insured health plan offered by the Diocese to its employees does not \ncover abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or contraceptives used to prevent pregnancy. \n43.  The Diocese’s self-insured health plan does not meet the definition of a \n“grandfathered” plan within the meaning of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The \nDiocese has not included a statement that the plan is believed to be a grandfathered plan, as \nrequired by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii). \n44.  The plan year for the Diocese begins on January 1. \n  13 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 14 of 47   PageID 14\nIII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \n45.  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the \n“Act”).  The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for “group health plan[s],” \nbroadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plan[s]” within the meaning of the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care . \n. . to employees or their dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1). \n46.  As relevant here, the Act requires an employer’s group health plan to cover \ncertain women’s “preventive care.”  Specifically, it indicates that “[a] group health plan and a \nhealth insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a \nminimum[,] provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for—\n(4) with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \npurposes of this paragraph.”  Pub. L. No. 111-148 § 1001(5), 124 Stat. 131 (codified at 42 \nU.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4)).  Because the Act prohibits “cost sharing requirements,” the health \nplan must pay for the full costs of these “preventive care” services without any deductible or co-\npayment. \n47.  “[T]he Affordable Care Act preserves the ability of individuals to retain coverage \nunder a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which the individual was enrolled on \nMarch 23, 2010.”  Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers \nRelating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,731 (July 19, 2010); 42 U.S.C. § 18011.  These so-called \n  14 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 15 of 47   PageID 15\n“grandfathered health plans do not have to meet the requirements” of the U.S. Government \nMandate.  75 Fed. Reg. at 41,731.  The Government estimates that “98 million individuals will \nbe enrolled in grandfathered group health plans in 2013.”  Id. at 41,732. \n48.  Violations of the Affordable Care Act can subject an employer and an insurer to \nsubstantial monetary penalties. \n49.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, employers who fail to provide all coverage \nrequired by the U.S. Government Mandate will be exposed to significant annual fines of $2,000 \nper full-time employee.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). \n50.  Additionally, under the Internal Revenue Code, group health plans that fail to \nprovide certain required coverage may be subject to an assessment of $100 a day per individual.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, Cong. Research Serv., \nRL 7-5700, Enforcement of the Preventive Health Care Services Requirements of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (2012) (asserting that this applies to employers who violate \nthe “preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act). \n51.  Under the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of HHS may impose a \nmonetary penalty of $100 a day per individual where an insurer fails to provide the coverage \nrequired by the U.S. Government Mandate.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(i); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 (asserting that this penalty applies to insurers who violate the \n“preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act). \n52.  ERISA may provide for additional penalties.  Under ERISA, plan participants can \nbring civil actions against insurers for unpaid benefits.  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700.  Similarly, the Secretary of Labor may bring an enforcement \naction against group health plans of employers that violate the U.S. Government Mandate, as \n  15 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 16 of 47   PageID 16\nincorporated by ERISA.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(b)(3); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 \n(asserting that these fines can apply to employers and insurers who violate the “preventive care” \nprovision of the Affordable Care Act). \n53.  Several of the Act’s provisions, along with other federal statutes, reflect a clear \ncongressional intent that the executive agency charged with identifying the “preventive care” \nrequired by § 300gg-13(a)(4) should exclude all abortion-related services.  The Act itself states \nthat “nothing in this title (or any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to require a \nqualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of its essential health \nbenefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  And the Act leaves it to “the issuer \nof a qualified health plan,” not the Government, “[to] determine whether or not the plan provides \ncoverage of [abortion].”  Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).  Likewise, the Weldon Amendment, which \nhas been included in every HHS and Department of Labor appropriations bill since 2004, states \nthat “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act [to the Department of Labor and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services] may be made available to a Federal agency or \nprogram . . . if such agency, program, or government subjects any institutional or individual \nhealth care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay \nfor, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. \nL. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n54.  The legislative history of the Act also demonstrates a clear congressional intent to \nprohibit the executive branch from requiring group health plans to provide abortion-related \nservices.  For example, the House of Representatives originally passed a bill that included an \namendment by Congressman Bart Stupak prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion \nservices.  See H.R. 3962, 111th Cong. § 265 (Nov. 7, 2009).  The Senate version, however, \n  16 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 17 of 47   PageID 17\nlacked that restriction.  S. Amend. No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (Dec. 23, 2009).  To \navoid a filibuster in the Senate, congressional proponents of the Act engaged in a procedure \nknown as “budget reconciliation” that required the House to adopt the Senate version of the bill \nlargely in its entirety.  Congressman Stupak and other pro-life House members, however, \nindicated that they would refuse to vote for the Senate version because it failed adequately to \nprohibit federal funding of abortion.  In an attempt to address these concerns, President Obama \nissued an executive order providing that no executive agency would authorize the federal \nfunding of abortion services.  See Executive Order 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).  \nThe Act was, therefore, passed on the central premise that all agencies would uphold and follow \n“longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” and to prohibit federal funding of abortion.  \nId.  That executive order was consistent with a 2009 speech that President Obama gave at the \nUniversity of Notre Dame, in which he indicated that his Administration would honor the \nconsciences of those who disagree with abortion, and draft sensible conscience clauses. \nB.  Regulatory Background – Defining “Preventive Care” and the Narrow Exemption \n55.  In less than two years, Defendants promulgated the U.S. Government Mandate, \nsubverting the Act’s clear purpose to protect the rights of conscience.  The U.S. Government \nMandate, moreover, was implemented contrary to the normal procedural rules governing the \npromulgation and implementation of rules of this magnitude. \n56.  In particular, on July 19, 2010, Defendants issued initial interim final rules \nconcerning § 300gg-13(a)(4)’s requirement that group health plans provide coverage for \nwomen’s “preventive care.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726.  Defendants dispensed \nwith notice-and-comment rulemaking for these rules.  Even though federal law had never \nrequired coverage of abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or contraceptives, Defendants \nclaimed both that the APA did not apply to the relevant provisions of the Affordable Care Act \n  17 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 18 of 47   PageID 18\nand that “it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay putting the \nprovisions in these interim final regulations in place until a full public notice and comment \nprocess was completed.”  Id. at 41,730. \n57.  The interim final rules referred to  the Affordable Care Act’s statutory language.  \nThey indicated that “a group health plan . . . must provide coverage for all of the following items \nand services, and may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, \ncoinsurance, or deductible) with respect to those items or services: . . . (iv) With respect to \nwomen, to the extent not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence-informed \npreventive care and screenings provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,759 \n(codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)). \n58.  The interim final rules, however, failed to identify the women’s “preventive care” \nthat Defendants planned to require employer group health plans to cover.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-\n13(a)(4).  Instead, Defendants noted that “[t]he Department of HHS [was] developing these \nguidelines and expects to issue them no later than August 1, 2011.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. \nReg. at 41,731. \n59.  Defendants permitted concerned entities to provide written comments about the \ninterim final rules.  See id. at 41,726.  But, as Defendants have conceded, they did not comply \nwith the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.  Id. at 41,730. \n60.  In response, several groups engaged in a lobbying effort to persuade Defendants \nto include various abortion-inducing drugs and contraceptives in the “preventive care” \nrequirements for  group health plans.  See, e.g., Press Release, Planned Parenthood, Planned \nParenthood Supports Initial White House Regulations on Preventive Care (July 14, 2010), \n  18 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 19 of 47   PageID 19\navailable at  http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-\nparenthood-supports-initial-white-house-regulations-preventive-care-highlights-need-new-\n33140.htm.  Other commenters noted that “preventive care” could not reasonably be interpreted \nto include such practices.  These groups indicated that pregnancy was not a disease that needed \nto be “prevented,” and that a contrary view would intrude on the sincerely held beliefs of many \nreligiously affiliated organizations.  See, e.g., Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, at 1-2 (Sept. 17, 2010), available at http://old.usccb.org/ogc/preventive.pdf. \n61.  On August 1, 2011, HHS announced the “preventive care” services that group \nhealth plans would be required to cover.  See Press Release, HHS, Affordable Care Act Ensures \nWomen Receive Preventive Services at No Additional Cost (Aug. 1, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html.  Again acting without notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking, HHS announced these guidelines through a press release rather than \nenactments in the Code of Federal Regulations or statements in the Federal Register.   \n62.  The press release made clear that the guidelines were developed by a non-\ngovernmental “independent” organization, the Institute of Medicine.  See id.  In developing the \nguidelines, the Institute of Medicine invited certain groups to make presentations on preventive \ncare. On information and belief, no  groups that oppose government-mandated coverage of \ncontraception, abortion, and related education and counseling were among the invited presenters.  \nComm. on Preventive Servs. for Women, Inst. of Med., Clinical Preventive Services for Women \napp. B at 217-21 (2011), http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13181&page=R1. \n63.  The Institute of Medicine’s own report, in turn, included a dissent that suggested \nthat the Institute of Medicine’s recommendations were made on an unduly short time frame \n  19 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 20 of 47   PageID 20\ndictated by political considerations and without the appropriate transparency for all concerned \npersons. \n64.  In direct contradiction of the central compromise necessary for the Affordable \nCare Act’s passage and President Obama’s promise to protect religious liberty, HHS’s guidelines \nrequired insurers and group health plans to cover  “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all \nwomen with reproductive capacity.”  See Health Res. Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive \nServices, Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ \n(last visited April 25, 2012).  FDA-approved contraceptives that qualify under these guidelines \ninclude drugs that induce abortions.  For example, the FDA has approved “emergency \ncontraceptives” such as the morning-after pill (otherwise known as Plan B), which can prevent a \nfertilized embryo from implanting in the womb, and Ulipristal (otherwise known as HRP 2000 \nor ella), which likewise can induce abortions of living embryos. \n65.  A few days later, on August 3, 2011, Defendants issued amendments to the \ninterim final rules that they had enacted in July 2010.  See Group Health Plans and Health \nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011).  Defendants issued the amendments \nagain without notice-and-comment rulemaking on the same grounds that they had provided for \nbypassing the APA with the original rules.  See id. at 46,624. \n66.  When announcing the amended regulations, Defendants ignored the view that \n“preventive care” should exclude abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or contraceptives that do \nnot prevent disease.  Instead, they noted only that “commenters [had] asserted that requiring \ngroup health plans sponsored by religious employers to cover contraceptive services that their \n  20 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 21 of 47   PageID 21\nfaith deems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious freedom.”  Id. at \n46,623. \n67.  Defendants then sought “to provide for a religious accommodation that \nrespect[ed]” only “the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in \nministerial positions.”  Id. \n68.  Specifically, the regulatory exemption ignored definitions of religious employers \nalready existing in federal law and, instead, covered only those employers whose purpose is to \ninculcate religious values, and who employ and serve primarily individuals of the same religion.  \nIt provides in full: \n(A) In developing the binding health plan coverage guidelines specified in this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iv), the Health Resources and Services Administration shall be \ninformed by evidence and may establish exemptions from such guidelines with \nrespect to group health plans established or maintained by religious employers \nand health insurance coverage provided in connection with group health plans \nestablished or maintained by religious employers with respect to any requirement \nto cover contraceptive services under such guidelines. \n(B) For purposes of this subsection, a “religious employer” is an organization that \nmeets all of the following criteria: \n(1)  The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization. \n(2)  The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets \nof the organization. \n(3)  The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization. \n(4)  The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section \n6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended. \nId. at 46,626 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(A)-(B)). \n  21 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 22 of 47   PageID 22\n69.  The exemption excludes the health plans of all other religiously affiliated \nemployers that view their missions as providing charitable, educational, and employment \nopportunities to all those who request it, regardless of their religious faith. \n70.  Moreover, determining whether an organization is sufficiently “religious” to \nqualify for the exemption requires an unconstitutionally invasive inquiry into an organization’s \nreligious beliefs and practices.  For example, the Government must determine the “religious \ntenets” of an organization and the individuals it employs and serves; it must determine whether \nthe organization “primarily” employs and “primarily” serves individuals who “share” the \norganization’s “religious tenets”; and it must determine whether “the purpose” of the \norganization is the “inculcation of religious values.” \n71.  When issuing this interim final rule, Defendants did not explain why they \nconstructed such a narrow religious exemption.  Nor did Defendants explain why they refused to \nincorporate other “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” that President Obama’s \nexecutive order previously had promised to respect.  See Executive Order 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. \n15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).  ERISA, for example, has long excluded “church plans” from its \nrequirements, more broadly defined to cover organizations that share religious bonds with a \nchurch.  See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1002(33)(C)(iv), 1003.  Likewise, the Affordable Care Act’s \nrequirement that all individuals maintain minimum essential coverage excludes those individuals \nwho have a religious objection to receiving benefits from public or private insurance.  26 U.S.C. \n§§ 1402(g)(1), 5000A(d)(2).  Nor did Defendants consider whether they had a compelling \ninterest to require religiously affiliated employers to include services in their health plans that \nwere contrary to their religious beliefs, or whether Defendants could achieve their views of \nsound policy in a more religiously accommodating manner. \n  22 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 23 of 47   PageID 23\n72.  Suggesting that they were open to good-faith discussion, Defendants once again \npermitted parties to provide comments to the amended rules.  Numerous organizations expressed \nthe same concerns that they had before, noting that the mandated services should not be viewed \nas “preventive care.”  They also explained that the religious exemption was “narrower than any \nconscience clause ever enacted in federal law, and narrower than the vast majority of religious \nexemptions from state contraceptive mandates.”  Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, at 1-2 (Aug. 31, 2011), available at http://www.usccb.org/about/general-\ncounsel/rulemaking/upload/comments-to-hhs-on-preventive-services-2011-08.pdf. \n73.  Three months later, “[a]fter evaluating [the new] comments” to the interim final \nrules, Defendants gave their response.  They did not request further discussion or make attempts \nat compromise.  Nor did they explain the basis for their decision.  Instead, Defendant Sebelius \nissued a short, Friday-afternoon press release, announcing, with little analysis or reasoning, that \nHHS had decided to keep the exemption unchanged, but creating a temporary enforcement safe \nharbor whereby  “[n]onprofit employers who, based on religious beliefs, do not currently provide \ncontraceptive coverage in their insurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until August \n1, 2013, to comply with the new law.”  See Press Release, HHS, A Statement by U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (Jan. 20, 2012), \navailable at http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html.  As noted by Bishop \nFarrell, the release effectively gave objecting religious institutions “one year to violate their \nconsciences.”  Most Reverend Kevin J. Farrell, D.D., The War Against Religious Freedom \nEscalates (Jan. 23, 2012), available at http://bishopkevinfarrell.org/blog/2012/01/the-war-\nagainst-religious-freedom-escalates/ (last visited Apr. 17, 2012).  Taken together, these various \nrules and press releases amount to a mandate that requires many  religiously affiliated \n  23 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 24 of 47   PageID 24\norganizations to provide coverage for services to their employees that are directly contrary to \ntheir religious beliefs. \n74.  On February 10, 2012, after a continuing public outcry against the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate and its exceedingly narrow conscience protections, the White House held \na press conference and issued another press release about the U.S. Government Mandate.  The \nWhite House announced that it had come up with a policy to “accommodate” religious \nobjections to the U.S. Government Mandate, according to which the insurance companies of \nreligious organizations that object to providing coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, \nsterilization, or contraceptives “will be required to directly offer . . . contraceptive care [to plan \nparticipants] free of charge.”  White House, Fact Sheet: Women’s Preventive Services and \nReligious Institutions (Feb. 10, 2012), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-women-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutions. \n75.  Despite objections that this “accommodation” did nothing of substance to protect \nthe right of conscience, when asked if there would be further room for compromise, White \nHouse Chief of Staff Jacob Lew responded: “No, this is our plan.”  David Eldridge & Cheryl \nWetzstein, White House Says Contraception Compromise Will Stand, The Washington Times, \nFeb. 12, 2012, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/12/white-house-birth-control-\ncompromise-will-stand/print/. \n76.  Defendants subsequently explained in the Federal Register that they “plan[ned] to \ninitiate a rulemaking to require issuers to offer insurance without contraception coverage to [an \nobjecting religious] employer (or plan sponsor) and simultaneously to offer contraceptive \ncoverage directly to the employer’s plan participants (and their beneficiaries) who desire it, with \nno cost-sharing.”  Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of \n  24 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 25 of 47   PageID 25\nPreventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, \n8728 (Feb. 15, 2012).  The Federal Register further asserted that the rulemaking would “achieve \nthe same goals for self-insured group health plans.”  Id. \n77.  Defendants then “finalize[d], without change,” the interim final rules containing \nthe religious employer exemption, 77 Fed. Reg. at 8729, and issued guidelines regarding the \npreviously announced “temporary enforcement safe harbor” for “non-exempted, non-profit \nreligious organizations with religious objections to such coverage.”  Id. at 8725; see Ctr. for \nConsumer Info. & Ins. Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor (Feb. \n10, 2012), available at http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-\nPreventive-Services-Bulletin.pdf. \n78.  On March 16, 2012, Defendants issued an Advance Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking (“ANPRM”) seeking comment on various ways to structure the proposed \naccommodation.  Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  The proposed scenarios require an “independent entity” to provide \ncoverage for the objectionable services at no cost to the participants.  But private entities do not \nprovide insurance coverage “for free.”  Moreover, even if these proposals were adopted, they \nwould still require religious organizations to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the \nobjectionable services.   Finally, it is also unclear whether the Government has statutory \nauthority to implement each of the possibilities referenced in the ANPRM. \n79.  The ANPRM does not alter existing law.  It merely states an intention to do so at \nsome point in the future.  But a promise to change the law, whether issued by the White House \nor in the form of an ANPRM does not, in fact, change the law.  The U.S. Government Mandate \n  25 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 26 of 47   PageID 26\nis therefore the current, operative law.  Plaintiff has until the start of the next plan year following \nAugust 1, 2013, to come into compliance with this law. \nIV.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE IMPOSES AN IMMEDIATE AND \nSUBSTANTIAL BURDEN ON PLAINTIFF’S RELIGIOUS LIBERTY \nA.    The U.S. Government Mandate Substantially Burdens Plaintiff’s Religious \nBeliefs \n80.  Responding to the U.S. Government Mandate, Bishop Farrell stated that it is “an \nattempt by the government to impose upon Catholic institutions a requirement to be a party to an \nact their long-standing teaching and tradition considers contrary to the moral law.”  Most \nReverend Kevin J. Farrell, D.D., Moral Principles Cannot Be Compromised (Feb. 14, 2012), \navailable at http://bishopkevinfarrell.org/blog/2012/02/moral-principles-cannot-be-\ncompromised/ (last visited Apr. 17, 2012).  Noting, “it is possible to compromise situations but \nnever moral principles,” Bishop Farrell calls the Church’s response to the U.S. Government \nMandate an “effort to protect religious liberty and freedom of conscience for all.”  Id.  Indeed, \nsince the founding of this country, one of the basic freedoms central to our society and legal \nsystem is that individuals and institutions are entitled to freedom of conscience and religious \npractice.  As noted by Thomas Jefferson, “[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer \nto man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of civil \nauthority.”  Thomas Jefferson, Letter to the Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church at New \nLondon, Conn. (Feb. 4, 1809). \n81.  The U.S. Government Mandate seeks to require Plaintiff to provide, pay for, \nand/or facilitate access to services that are contrary to its religious beliefs.  It thus substantially \nburdens Plaintiff’s firmly held religious beliefs. \n82.  The U.S. Government Mandate also seeks to compel Plaintiff to fund “patient \neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  It therefore compels \n  26 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 27 of 47   PageID 27\nPlaintiff to pay for, provide, and/or facilitate speech that is contrary to its firmly held religious \nbeliefs. \n83.  Although the U.S. Government Mandate contains a narrow religious exemption, \nin order to qualify, religious organizations must submit to an invasive governmental inquiry \nregarding their purpose and religious beliefs.  Requiring Plaintiff to submit to this government-\nconducted religious test likewise substantially burdens its firmly held religious beliefs. \n84.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret “the purpose” of an \norganization. \n85.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret vague terms, such as \n“primarily,” “share,” and “religious tenets.” \n86.  It is unclear how the Government will ascertain the “religious tenets” of an \norganization, those it employs, and those it serves. \n87.  It is unclear how much overlap the Government will require for religious tenets to \nbe “share[d].” \n88.  Any attempt by Plaintiff to qualify for the narrow religious employer exemption \nby restricting its charitable and educational mission to coreligionists would have devastating \neffects on the communities Plaintiff serves. \n89.  Indeed, the Government does not even allow Plaintiff to avoid the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate by exiting the health care market.  Eliminating its employee group health \nplan or refusing to provide plans that cover abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or \ncontraceptives would expose Plaintiff to substantial fines.  It is no “choice” to leave those \nemployees scrambling for health insurance while subjecting Plaintiff to significant fines for \n  27 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 28 of 47   PageID 28\nbreaking the law.  Yet that is what the U.S. Government Mandate requires for Plaintiff to adhere \nto its religious beliefs. \n90.  Nor would the opaque, promised “accommodation”—even if it were law, which it \nis not—relieve Plaintiff from the unconscionable position in which the U.S. Government \nMandate currently puts it, for numerous reasons. \n91.  First, the promised “accommodation” would not alter the fact that Plaintiff would \nbe required to facilitate practices that run directly contrary to its beliefs.  Catholic teaching does \nnot simply require Catholic institutions to avoid directly paying for practices that are viewed as \nintrinsically immoral.  It also requires them to avoid actions that facilitate those practices. \n92.  Second, any requirement that insurance companies or other independent entities \nprovide preventive services “free of charge” is illusory.  For-profit entities do not provide \nservices for free.  Instead, increased costs are passed through to consumers in the form of higher \npremiums or fees.  Under the proposed accommodation, doctors will still have to be paid to \nprescribe the objectionable services, and drug companies and pharmacists will still have to be \npaid for providing them.  Hypothetical future savings cannot be used to pay those fees; rather, \nthe money will necessarily be derived from increased premiums or fees. \n93.  Third, the “accommodation” does not affect the narrow exemption applicable to \n“religious employers.”  To qualify for that narrow exemption, religious organizations must \nsubmit to an invasive governmental inquiry.  Requiring Plaintiff to submit to this government-\nconducted test to determine if Plaintiff is sufficiently religious is inappropriate and substantially \nburdens its firmly held religious beliefs. \n  28 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 29 of 47   PageID 29\n94.  Finally, as noted herein, the U.S. Government Mandate is burdening Plaintiff’s \nreligious beliefs right now.  Plaintiff cannot possibly wait until August 1, 2013, to determine \nhow to respond to the U.S. Government Mandate. \n95.  In short, while the President claimed to have “f[ou]nd a solution that works for \neveryone” and that ensures that “[r]eligious liberty will be protected,” in reality, his promised \n“accommodation” does neither. \n96.  Accordingly, unless and until this issue is definitively resolved, the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate does and will continue to impose a substantial burden on Plaintiff’s \nreligious beliefs. \nB.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not a Neutral Law of General Applicability \n97.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability.  It \noffers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans include or \nfacilitate coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraception, and related education \nand counseling.  It was, moreover, implemented by and at the behest of individuals and \norganizations who disagree with certain religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception, \nand thus targets religious organizations for disfavored treatment. \n98.  For example, the U.S. Government Mandate exempts all “grandfathered” plans \nfrom its requirements. \n99.  The Government has also crafted a religious exemption to the U.S. Government \nMandate that favors certain religions over others.  As noted, it applies only to plans sponsored by \nreligious organizations that have, as their  “purpose,” the “inculcation of religious values”; that \n“primarily” serve individuals that share their “religious tenets”; and that “primarily” employ \nsuch individuals.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B). \n  29 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 30 of 47   PageID 30\n100.  This narrow exemption may protect some religious organizations.  But it does not \nprotect the many Catholic and other religious organizations that educate students of varying \nreligious beliefs, provide vital social services to the individuals of varying religious beliefs, and \nemploy individuals of varying religious beliefs.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus \ndiscriminates against such religious organizations because of their religious commitment to \neducate, serve, and employ people of varying faiths. \n101.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, was promulgated by Government \nofficials, and supported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose certain \nCatholic teachings and beliefs.  For example, on October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke at a \nfundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America.  Defendant Sebelius has long been a staunch \nsupporter of abortion rights and a vocal critic of Catholic teachings and beliefs regarding \nabortion and contraception.  NARAL Pro-Choice America is a pro-abortion organization that \nlikewise opposes many Catholic teachings.  At that fundraiser, Defendant Sebelius declared that \n“we are in a war,” presumably with those entities, like Plaintiff, whose beliefs differ from those \nheld by her and the other attendees of the NARAL Pro-Choice America fundraiser. \n102.  Consequently, on information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that the purpose of the \nU.S. Government Mandate, including the narrow exemption, is to discriminate against religious \ninstitutions and organizations that oppose abortion and contraception. \nC.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not the Least Restrictive Means of Furthering a \nCompelling Governmental Interest \n103.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to promoting a \ncompelling governmental interest. \n104.  The U.S. Government has no compelling interest in forcing Plaintiff to violate its \nsincerely held religious beliefs by requiring it to provide, pay for, or facilitate access to abortion-\n  30 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 31 of 47   PageID 31\ninducing drugs, sterilizations, contraceptives, and related education and counseling.  The \nGovernment itself has relieved numerous other employers from this requirement by exempting \ngrandfathered plans and plans of employers it deems to be sufficiently religious.  Moreover, \nthese services are widely available in the United States.  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that \nindividuals have a constitutional right to use such services.  And nothing that Plaintiff does \ninhibits any individual from exercising that right. \n105.  Even assuming the interest was compelling, the Government has numerous \nalternatives to furthering that interest other than forcing Plaintiff to violate its religious beliefs.  \nFor example, the Government could provide or pay for the objectionable services through \nexpansion of its existing network of family planning clinics funded by HHS under Title X or \nthrough other programs established by a duly enacted law.  Or, at a minimum, it could create a \nbroader exemption for religious employers, such as those found in numerous state laws \nthroughout the country and in other federal laws.  The Government therefore cannot possibly \ndemonstrate that requiring Plaintiff to violate its conscience is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering its interest. \n106.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, would simultaneously undermine both \nreligious freedom—a fundamental right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution—and access to the \nwide variety of social and educational services that Plaintiff provides.  As  President Obama \nacknowledged in his February 10th announcement, religious organizations like Plaintiff do \n“more good for a community than a government program ever could.”  The U.S. Government \nMandate, however, puts these good works in jeopardy. \n  31 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 32 of 47   PageID 32\n107.  That is unconscionable.  Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate cannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiff, an injunction barring its \nenforcement, and an order vacating the Mandate. \nD.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Excessively \nEntangles the Government In Religion And Interferes With Religious \nInstitutions’ Religious Doctrine \n108.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s religious employer exemption further \nexcessively entangles the Government in defining the purpose and religious tenets of each \norganization and its employees and beneficiaries. \n109.  In order to determine whether Plaintiff—or any other religious organization—\nqualifies for the exemption, the Government would have to identify the organization’s “religious \ntenets” and determine whether “the purpose” of the organization is to “inculcate” people into \nthose tenets. \n110.  The Government would then have to conduct an inquiry into the practices and \nbeliefs of the individuals that the organization ultimately employs, educates, and serves. \n111.  The Government would then have to compare and contrast those religious \npractices and beliefs to determine whether and how many of them are “share[d].” \n112.  Regardless of outcome, this inquiry is unconstitutional, and Plaintiff strongly \nobjects to such an intrusive governmental investigation into an organization’s religious mission. \n113.  The religious employer exemption is based on an improper Government \ndetermination that “inculcation” is the only legitimate religious purpose. \n114.  The Government should not base an exemption on an assessment of the “purity” \nor legitimacy of an institution’s  religious purpose. \n115.  By limiting that legitimate purpose to inculcation, at the expense of other \nsincerely held religious purposes, the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with religious \n  32 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 33 of 47   PageID 33\nautonomy.  Religious institutions have the right to determine their own religious purpose, \nincluding religious purposes broader than inculcation, without Government interference and \nwithout losing their religious liberties. \n116.  Defining religion based on employing and serving primarily people who share the \norganization’s religious tenets directly contradicts Plaintiff’s sincerely held religious beliefs \nregarding its religious mission to serve all people, regardless of whether or not they share the \nsame faith. \nE.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Causing Present Hardship to Plaintiff That \nShould Be Remedied by a Court \n117.  The U.S. Government Mandate is already causing serious, ongoing hardship to \nPlaintiff that merits judicial relief now. \n118.  Health plans do not take shape overnight.  Many analyses, negotiations, and \ndecisions must occur each year before Plaintiff can offer a health benefits package to its \nemployees.  For example, an employer using an outside insurance issuer must work with \nactuaries to evaluate its funding reserves, and then negotiate with the insurer to determine the \ncost of the products and services it wants to offer its employees.  An employer that is self-\ninsured—like Plaintiff—after consulting with its actuaries, must similarly negotiate with its \nthird-party administrator. \n119.   Under normal circumstances, Plaintiff must begin the process of determining its \nhealth care package for a plan year at least one year before the plan year begins.  The multiple \nlevels of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Government Mandate make this already lengthy \nprocess even more complex. \n120.   For example, if Plaintiff decides that the only tolerable option is to attempt to \nqualify as a “religious employer” under the U.S. Government Mandate, it will need to undertake \n  33 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 34 of 47   PageID 34\na major overhaul of its organizational structure, hiring practices, and the scope of its \nprogramming.  This process could take years. \n121.   In addition, if Plaintiff does not comply with the U.S. Government Mandate, it \nmay be subject to annual government fines and penalties.  Plaintiff requires time to budget for \nany such additional expenses. \n122.   The U.S. Government Mandate and its uncertain legality, moreover, undermine \nPlaintiff’s ability to hire and retain employees. \n123.   Plaintiff therefore needs judicial relief now in order to prevent the serious, \nongoing harm that the U.S. Government Mandate is already imposing on it. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise \nin Violation of RFRA \n124.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n125.  RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s exercise \nof religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the Government \ndemonstrates that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that interest. \n126.  RFRA protects organizations as well as individuals from Government-imposed \nsubstantial burdens on religious exercise. \n127.  RFRA applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law by any \nbranch, department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States. \n128.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiff to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to its religious beliefs. \n  34 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 35 of 47   PageID 35\n129.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiff must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into its religious \nbeliefs. \n130.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiff’s exercise of \nreligion. \n131.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiff to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n132.  Requiring Plaintiff to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate is not the least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. \n133.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate against \nPlaintiff, Defendants have violated RFRA. \n134.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n135.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT II \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n136.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n137.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government from \nsubstantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion. \n138.  The Free Exercise Clause protects organizations as well as individuals from \nGovernment-imposed burdens on religious exercise. \n139.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiff to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to its religious beliefs. \n  35 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 36 of 47   PageID 36\n140.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiff must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into its religious \nbeliefs. \n141.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiff’s exercise of \nreligion. \n142.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability, \nbecause it is riddled with exemptions.  It offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that \nemployer-based health plans include or facilitate coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, \nsterilization, contraception and related education and counseling. \n143.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability, \nbecause it discriminates against certain religious viewpoints and targets certain religious \norganizations for disfavored treatment.  Defendants enacted the U.S. Government Mandate \ndespite being aware of the substantial burden it would place on Plaintiff’s exercise of religion. \n144.  The U.S. Government Mandate implicates constitutional rights in addition to the \nright to free exercise of religion, including, for example, the rights to free speech and to freedom \nfrom excessive government entanglement with religion. \n145.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiff to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n146.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n147.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate, the \nGovernment has burdened Plaintiff’s religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise Clause \nof the First Amendment. \n  36 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 37 of 47   PageID 37\n148.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n149.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT III \nExcessive Entanglement in Violation of the  \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n150.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n151.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nprohibit intrusive government inquiries into the religious beliefs of individuals and institutions, \nand other forms of excessive entanglement between religion and Government. \n152.  This prohibition on excessive entanglement protects organizations as well as \nindividuals. \n153.  In order to qualify for the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate for \n“religious employers,” entities must submit to an invasive government investigation into an \norganization’s religious beliefs, including whether the organization’s “purpose” is the \n“inculcation of religious values” and whether the organization “primarily employs” and \n“primarily serves” individuals who share the organization’s religious tenets. \n154.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus requires the Government to engage in \nintrusive inquiries and judgments regarding questions of religious belief or practice. \n155.  The U.S. Government Mandate results in an excessive entanglement between \nreligion and Government. \n156.  The U.S. Government Mandate is therefore unconstitutional and invalid. \n157.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. \n158.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n  37 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 38 of 47   PageID 38\n159.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT IV \nReligious Discrimination in Violation of the \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n160.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n161.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nmandate the equal treatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or \npreference. \n162.  This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n163.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s narrow exemption for certain “religious \nemployers” but not others discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious status. \n164.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer likewise \ndiscriminates among different types of religious entities based on the nature of those entities’ \nreligious beliefs or practices. \n165.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer furthers no \ncompelling governmental interest. \n166.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer is not narrowly \ntailored to further a compelling governmental interest. \n167.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. \n168.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n169.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \n  38 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 39 of 47   PageID 39\nCOUNT V \nInterference in Matters of Internal Church Governance in Violation of \nthe Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n170.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n171.  The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause protect the freedom of \nreligious organizations to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernment as well as those of faith and doctrine. \n172.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, or \ndoctrine. \n173.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n174.  Plaintiff is a religious organization affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. \n175.  The Catholic Church views abortion, sterilization, and contraception as \nintrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from condoning or facilitating those \npractices. \n176.  Plaintiff has abided and must continue to abide by the decision of the Catholic \nChurch on these issues. \n177.  The Government may not interfere with, or otherwise question, the decision of the \nCatholic Church that its religious organizations may not support, promote, or materially \ncooperate in abortion, sterilization, and contraception services. \n178.  The Government may not interfere with or otherwise question the final decision \nof the Catholic Church that its religious organizations must abide by these views. \n  39 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 40 of 47   PageID 40\n179.  Plaintiff has therefore made the internal decision that the health plan it offers to its \nemployees may not cover, subsidize, or facilitate abortion, sterilization, or contraception. \n180.  The U.S. Government Mandate interferes with Plaintiff’s internal decisions \nconcerning its structure and mission by requiring it to facilitate practices that directly conflict \nwith Catholic beliefs. \n181.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s interference with Plaintiff’s internal decisions \naffects its faith and mission by requiring it to facilitate practices that directly conflict with its \nreligious beliefs. \n182.  Because the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with the internal decision-\nmaking of Plaintiff in a manner that affects Plaintiff’s faith and mission, it violates the \nEstablishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n183.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n184.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT VI \nCompelled Speech in Violation of \nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \n185.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n186.  The First Amendment protects against the compelled affirmation of any religious \nor ideological proposition that the speaker finds unacceptable. \n187.  The First Amendment protects organizations as well as individuals against \ncompelled speech. \n188.  Expenditures are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. \n189.  The First Amendment protects against the use of a speaker’s money to support a \nviewpoint that conflicts with the speaker’s religious or ideological beliefs. \n  40 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 41 of 47   PageID 41\n190.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiff to provide health care \nplans to its employees that include or facilitate coverage of practices that violate its religious or \nideological beliefs. \n191.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiff to subsidize, promote, and \nfacilitate education and counseling services regarding these practices. \n192.  By imposing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants are compelling Plaintiff \nto publicly subsidize or facilitate the activity and speech of private entities that are contrary to its \nreligious beliefs. \n193.  The U.S. Government Mandate is viewpoint-discriminatory and subject to strict \nscrutiny. \n194.  The U.S. Government Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n195.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n196.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n197.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT VII \nFailure to Conduct Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking and Improper  \nDelegation in Violation of the APA \n198.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n199.  The Affordable Care Act expressly delegates to an agency within Defendant \nHHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the authority to establish guidelines \nconcerning the “preventive care” that a group health plan and health insurance issuer must \nprovide. \n  41 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 42 of 47   PageID 42\n200.  Given this express delegation, Defendants were required to engage in formal \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law before issuing the guidelines that \ngroup health plans and insurers must cover.  Proposed regulations were required to be published \nin the Federal Register and interested persons were required to be given an opportunity to \nparticipate in the rulemaking through the submission of written data, views, or arguments. \n201.  Defendants promulgated the “preventive care” guidelines without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law. \n202.  Defendants, instead, delegated their responsibilities for issuing preventive care \nguidelines to a non-governmental entity, the Institute of Medicine. \n203.  The Institute of Medicine did not permit or provide for the broad public comment \notherwise required under the APA concerning the guidelines that it would recommend.  The \ndissent to the Institute of Medicine report noted both that the Institute of Medicine conducted its \nreview in an unacceptably short time frame, and that the review process lacked transparency. \n204.  Within two weeks of the Institute of Medicine issuing its guidelines, Defendant \nHHS issued a press release announcing that the Institute of Medicine’s guidelines were required \nunder the Affordable Care Act. \n205.  Defendants have never explained why they failed to enact these “preventive care” \nguidelines through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA. \n206.  Defendants also failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when issuing \nthe interim final rules and the final rule incorporating the guidelines. \n207.  Defendants’ stated reasons for promulgating these rules without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking do not constitute “good cause.”  Providing public notice \n  42 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 43 of 47   PageID 43\nand an opportunity for comment was not impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest for the reasons claimed by Defendants. \n208.  By enacting the “preventive care” guidelines and interim and final rules through \ndelegation to a non-governmental entity and without engaging in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, Defendants failed to observe a procedure required by law and thus violated 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D). \n209.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n210.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate without observance of a \nprocedure required by law and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing \nharm on Plaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT VIII \nArbitrary and Capricious Action in Violation of the APA \n211.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n212.  The APA condemns agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n213.  The APA requires that an agency examine the relevant data and articulate an \nexplanation for its action that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the \npolicy choice made. \n214.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious under the APA if the agency has failed \nto consider an important aspect of the problem before it. \n215.  A court reviewing agency action may not supply a reasoned basis that the agency \nitself has failed to offer. \n216.  Defendants failed to consider the suggestion of many commenters that abortion-\ninducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception could not be viewed as “preventive care.” \n  43 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 44 of 47   PageID 44\n217.  Defendants failed adequately to engage with voluminous comments suggesting \nthat the scope of the religious exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate should be broadened. \n218.  Defendants did not articulate a reasoned basis for their action by drawing a \nconnection between facts found and the policy decisions they made. \n219.  Defendants failed to provide any standards or processes for how the \nAdministration will decide which religious institutions will be included in the religious \nexemption. \n220.  Defendants failed to consider the use of broader religious exemptions in many \nother federal laws and regulations. \n221.  Defendants’ promulgation of the U.S. Government Mandate violates the APA. \n222.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n223.  The U.S. Government Mandate imposes an immediate and ongoing harm on the \nPlaintiff that warrants declaratory relief. \nCOUNT IX \nActing Illegally in Violation of the APA \n224.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n225.  The APA requires that all Government agency action, findings, and conclusions \nbe “in accordance with law.” \n226.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its exemption are illegal and therefore in \nviolation of the APA. \n227.  The Weldon Amendment states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be \nmade available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \n  44 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 45 of 47   PageID 45\nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d), 125 Stat. \n786, 1111 (2011). \n228.  The Affordable Care Act states that “nothing in this title (or any amendment by \nthis title) shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] \nservices . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  It adds that “the issuer of a qualified health plan shall determine whether or \nnot the plan provides coverage of [abortion.]”  Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii). \n229.  The Affordable Care Act contains no clear expression of an affirmative intention \nof Congress that employers with religiously motivated objections to the provision of health plans \nthat include coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraception, or related \neducation and counseling should be required to provide such plans. \n230.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires employer-based health plans to provide \ncoverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraception, and related education.  It does \nnot permit employers or issuers to determine whether the plan covers abortion, as the Act \nrequires.  By issuing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants have exceeded their authority \nand ignored the direction of Congress. \n231.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates RFRA. \n232.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment. \n233.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not in accordance with law and thus violates 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n234.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. \n  45 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 46 of 47   PageID 46\n235.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate that is not in accordance with \nlaw and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiff that \nwarrants declaratory relief. \nJURY DEMAND \n236.  Plaintiff respectfully demands a jury trial in this matter. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Court: \n1.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiff’s rights under RFRA; \n2.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiff’s rights under the First Amendment; \n3.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  was \npromulgated in violation of the APA; \n4.  Enter  an  injunction  prohibiting  Defendants  from  enforcing  the  U.S. \nGovernment Mandate against Plaintiff; \n5.  Enter an order vacating the U.S. Government Mandate; \n6.  Award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and expert fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n7.  Award all other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n   \n  46 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-01589-B   Document 1    Filed 05/21/12    Page 47 of 47   PageID 47\n  Respectfully submitted, this the 21st day of May, 2012. \n           \n           \nBy:  /s/ Terence M.

Finding that the Plaintiff has standing to bring this suit, the Court nonetheless\nconcludes that the issues raised in the Complaint are not ripe for review. Accordingly, the Court\nGRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants’ Motion as follows.\nI.\nBACKGROUND\nIn one of many similar cases threading their way through the federal courts, Plaintiff The\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Dallas has sued the United States Departments of Health and Human\nServices (“HHS”), Labor, and Treasury, as well as their respective Secretaries, Kathleen Sebelius,\nHilda Solis, and Timothy Geithner in their official capacities (collectively, “Defendants”), to\n- 1 -\n\nchallenge certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), Pub. L.\nNo. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation\nAct, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010), and the regulations issued by each of the\nDefendants implementing it. Specifically, Plaintiff avers that the ACA and its implementing\nregulations, once enforced, will require Plaintiff to provide its employees with health insurance\ncoverage for services and medications that defy the religious tenets held by Plaintiff. Plaintiff files this\npre-enforcement challenge to the ACA for declaratory and injunctive relief.\nA. Statutory and Regulatory Background\nIn March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”),\nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), which was amended by the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively referred to as the\n“ACA”). The ACA established requirements for insured and self-insured “employee welfare benefit\nplans,” as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1002(1). See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1). Under the ACA, the group health plans must provide\ncoverage for women’s “preventive care and screenings” as defined by the comprehensive guidelines\nset forth by the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), an agency within the\nHHS. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a). The “preventive care” coverage may not impose any cost-sharing\nrequirements on the patient. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Should an employer violate the ACA, it\nmay be subject to monetary fines under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D(b),\n4980H(a), (c)(1); Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-\n22(b)(2)(C)(i); and ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). The health care requirements are waived\nfor “grandfathered” group health plans, which are generally defined as plans that existed prior to\n- 2 -\n\nMarch 23, 2010 and have not undergone designated changes. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i)\n(Treasury); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a)(1)(i)(Labor); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a)(1)(i)(HHS).\nOn July 19, 2010, the government issued interim final rules implementing the preventive\nservices coverage provision and announced that HHS was developing the HRSA-supported\ncomprehensive guidelines to define preventive care coverage under the ACA. 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726\n(July 19, 2010). HHS commissioned the government-funded Institute of Medicine to recommend\nthe substance of the guidelines. The Institute of Medicine recommended that “preventive care”\nshould include Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization\nprocedures, and patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.1 See Inst.\nof Med., Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011). On August 1, 2011, the\nDefendants adopted the guidelines advanced by the Institute of Medicine. 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug.\n3, 2011).\nOn August 3, 2011, the HRSA also implemented an amendment that exempted certain\nreligious employers from the comprehensive guidelines and requirements to cover contraceptive\nservices. Id.; 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A). The regulation defined a “religious employer” as:\nan organization that meets all of the following criteria:\n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization.\n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the\norganization.\n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the\norganization.\n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1)\nand section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\n1Employers are not required to cover abortion services, 42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i), and federal\nagencies will lose funding should they require that an employer provide coverage for abortions. Pub. L. No.\n112-74, 125 Stat. 786 (2011); Exec. Order 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010). \n- 3 -\n\namended.2\n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B). Together, Defendants adopted this version of the religious\nemployer exemption in the final regulations on February 15, 2012.\nAware that some religious entities may not qualify for the “religious employer” exemption,\nthe government issued a bulletin announcing a one-year “temporary enforcement safe harbor” for\ncertain non-profit organizations. An organization meeting the following criteria is said to be safe from\nenforcement  during  the  safe-harbor  period:  (1)  the  employer  is  a  non-exempt,  non-profit\norganization, (2) due the organization’s religious objections, the health care plan has not offered\ncontraceptive coverage from February 10, 2012 onward, (3) the plan year begins between August\n1, 2012 and August 1, 2013, and (4) the organization self-certifies that it meets the above criteria.\nHHS, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor, at 3 (Feb. 10, 2012); 77 Fed. Reg.\n8725, 8728 (Feb. 15, 2012); 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012). The purported purpose of the one-\nyear safe-harbor provision was to give the government time “to develop and propose changes to the[]\nfinal regulations that would meet two goals–providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing\nto individuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted, non-profit organizations’ religious\nobjections to covering contraceptive services.” Id. at 8727. The safe harbor began February 10, 2012\nand continues through the first plan year for any plan that begins on or before August 1, 2012,\neffectively protecting qualified entities from enforcement until their new plan year initiating on or\nafter August 1, 2013. The government pledges to work with non-exempt religious organizations to\nissue amended regulation(s) that accommodate religious coverage concerns. Id. at 8728-8729.\n2Internal Revenue Code § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii) apply to “churches, their integrated auxiliaries,\nand conventions or associations of churches” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.”\n- 4 -\n\nOn March 21, 2012, the government published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule\nMaking (“ANPRM”), notifying the public of its intent to reconsider the ACA implementing\nregulations, including ways to accommodate non-exempt religious organizations. 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501\n(Mar. 21, 2012). The ANPRM stated that the departments “intend to finalize these amendments\nto the final regulations such that they are effective by the end of the temporary enforcement safe\nharbor.” Id. at 16,503. The ANPRM recognized the need to “to help identify issues relating to the\naccommodation to be developed with respect to non-exempt, non-profit religious organizations with\nreligious objections to contraceptive coverage.” Id. The ANPRM further outlined the process for\namendment, including an ANPRM comment period, publication of an proposed rule, a comment\nperiod on the proposed rule, and promulgation of amended final regulations. Id.\nWhen this action was filed, no actual or concrete proposals to amend the ACA implementing\nregulations had been promulgated, though the government had made numerous public statements\nthat the proposed amendments would be finalized in the first quarter of 2013. Doc. 31-1, Resp. to\nNotice at 3 n.3. The government had also represented to numerous federal courts that amendment\nwould be forthcoming and that they would never enforce the current regulations against certain non-\nexempt religious entities. See, e.g., Wheaton Coll. v. Sebelius, No. 12-5273 and 12-5291, 703 F.3d 551,\n__, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 26716, at *7-8 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 18, 2012).\nApproximately eight months after Plaintiff filed this action and five months after Defendant’s\nMotion to Dismiss was fully briefed, Defendants issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”),\n78 Fed. Reg. 8456 (Feb. 6, 2013). The NPRM offers a proposed amendment to the ACA\nimplementing regulations and requests comment on the same. The NPRM comment period remains\nopen until April 8, 2013. Id. Among other suggestions, the NPRM outlines an amended definition\n- 5 -\n\nof “religious employer” for the exemption at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B). The proposed\namendment eliminates the first three prongs of the religious employer test, requiring only that the\nemployer “is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i)\nor (iii) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 8461. The explained purpose of the\namendment is as follows: “[T]he proposed rules would amend the criteria for the religious employer\nexemption to ensure that an otherwise exempt employer plan is not disqualified because the\nemployer’s purposes extend beyond the inculcation of religious values or because the employer serves\nor hires people of different religious faiths.” Id. at 8459. The NPRM also declares that “[t]he\nDepartments intend to finalize all such proposed amendments before the end of the temporary\nenforcement safe harbor.” Id. at 8459.\nB. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas\nPlaintiff is a nonprofit organization existing under the Code of Canon Law of the Roman\nCatholic Church. Doc. 1, Compl. ¶ 15. It operates seventy-four parishes and quasi-parishes, thirty-\neight elementary and secondary schools, and other 501(c)(3) charitable enterprises in the Dallas,\nTexas area. Id. ¶ 27. Plaintiff provides its benefits-eligible employees with a self-insured health plan\nthrough which Plaintiff underwrites employee health costs using a third-party plan administrator,\nAetna. Id. ¶ 41. Plaintiff’s religious principles do not support the use of “abortion-inducing drugs,”\nthe “facilitation of sterilization services,” “contraception,” or related counseling services. Id. ¶¶ 2, 4.\nAs such, Plaintiff’s employee health care plan does not presently include coverage for those services.\nId. ¶ 42.\nPlaintiff certifies that its health care plan does not meet the definition of a “grandfathered”\nplan  under  26  C.F.R.  §  54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i)  (Treasury);  29  C.F.R.  §  2590.715-\n- 6 -\n\n1251(a)(1)(i)(Labor); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a)(1)(i)(HHS). Id. ¶43. Plaintiff maintains that it “does\nnot know” whether it falls within the protection of the current regulatory exemption for religious\nemployers, because under the second and third prongs of that definition, religious employers must\nprimarily  employ  and  serve  persons  who  share  the  organization’s  faith.3  45  C.F.R.  §\n147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B). Plaintiff’s Catholic mission, however, requires it to hire and serve non-\nCatholics. For example, Plaintiff operates parochial schools that educate over 15,000 students; in one\nsuch establishment, Bishop Dunne Catholic School, half of its students are non-Catholics. Id. ¶¶ 32,\n34. Plaintiff also oversees significant social service work for the homeless, immigrants, and the elderly,\nbut does not keep records of the persons served nor request to know their religious affiliation. Id. ¶¶\n36-37.  Third,  Plaintiff  employs  90  benefits-eligible  employees  at  its  Pastoral  Center  and\napproximately 1,300 benefits-eligible teachers, but Plaintiff similarly does not request nor keep track\nof its employees’ religious affiliation. Id. ¶ 37. Because it serves and employs non-Catholics, Plaintiff\nfears that it would not qualify for an exemption under the ACA implementing regulations and will\nbe forced to provide coverage for services involving artificial interference with the creation of human\nlife, contrary to its sincerely-held values and religious beliefs. Id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff does not dispute that\nit qualifies for the temporary enforcement safe harbor and thus will not be required to comply with\nthe ACA coverage mandates until January 1, 2014, when its health care plan year begins.\nC. Federal Cases Reviewing ACA Challenges\nNumerous federal district courts have been faced with nearly identical ACA challenges by\n3Given the recency of the NPRM, Plaintiff has not taken a position as to whether it would fall under\nthe religious employer exemption proposed in the NPRM. However, Plaintiff admits that “[i]t is organized\nexclusively for charitable, religious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the\nInternal Revenue Code.” Doc. 1, Compl. ¶ 15.\n- 7 -\n\nCatholic entities, universities, and other religiously-oriented groups. The vast majority of cases have\nfound that challenges to the ACA and the regulations are nonjusticiable because the plaintiffs lack\nstanding and the claims are unripe. See Archdiocese of St. Louis v. Sebelius, No. 4:12-CV-00924-JAR,\n2013 WL 32926 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 29, 2013); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, No. 3:12CV253RLM,\n2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183267 (N.D. Ind.

Only\ntwo courts have found the challenge justiciable. Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth v. Sebelius, No.\n4:12-CV-314-Y (N.D. Tex. Jan. 31, 2013); Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, No. 12\nCiv. 2542 (BMC), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172695 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2012) (finding justiciable a non-\nprofit’s ACA challenge, but dismissing the claims by the Diocese and Catholic Charities for lack of\nstanding). The only circuit court to review an ACA decision held that the plaintiffs had standing to\nchallenge the ACA and implementing regulations, but determined that the issues were not ripe given\nthe government’s representations that the regulations would be amended. Wheaton Coll., 703 F.3d\nat 551 (holding case in abeyance rather than dismissing it).4 Following the D.C. Circuit Court’s\nruling, several courts avoided deciding ACA challenges based on standing, but granted dismissal on\nripeness grounds. See Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Sebelius, No. 12-0815, 2013 WL 285599\n4The Circuit Court consolidated and reversed in part Belmont Abbey Coll. v. Sebelius, No. 11-1989\n(JEB), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125519 (D.D.C. Sept. 5, 2012), and Wheaton Coll. v. Sebelius, No. 12-1169\n(ESH), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120187 (D.D.C.

No court has issued a decision on a relevant ACA challenge\nsince the NPRM was published.5\nD. Plaintiff’s Civil Action\nOn May 21, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants alleging the following causes\nof action: the ACA and implementing regulations constitute a substantial burden on Plaintiff’s\nreligious exercise in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (“RFRA”), 42\nU.S.C. §§ 2000bb-2000bb-4 (count I); the ACA and implementing regulations constitute a\nsubstantial burden on Plaintiff’s religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution (count II);  the ACA and implementing regulations require\nthe government’s excessive entanglement into religion in violation of the Free Exercise and\nEstablishment Clauses of the First Amendment (count III); the ACA and implementing regulations\nconstitute religious discrimination in violation of the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses (count\nIV); the ACA and implementing regulations constitute interference in Plaintiff’s internal church\ngovernance in violation of the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses (count V); the ACA and\nimplementing regulations require compelled speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment (count VI); the implementing regulations to the ACA were promulgated without\n5Throughout this litigation, the parties have laudably updated the Court on the outcome of each\nACA case.\n- 9 -\n\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking and the government delegated its obligations to the Institute of\nMedicine in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq. (count\nVII); the ACA and implementing regulations require the government to take action that is arbitrary\nand capricious in violation of the APA (count VIII); and the ACA and implementing regulations\nare unlawful, in violation of the APA (count IX). Doc. 1, Compl. ¶¶ 124-235. The Complaint\nrequests declaratory judgments finding that the ACA and implementing regulations violate the\nRFRA and the First Amendment as applied to Plaintiff; a declaratory judgment that the ACA and\nimplementing regulations violate the APA; an injunction prohibiting the government from enforcing\nthe  ACA  and  implementing  regulations  against  Plaintiff;  an  order  vacating  the  ACA  and\nimplementing regulations; and expert and attorney’s fees. Id. at ¶¶ 14, 107, prayer.\nFollowing the Complaint, Defendants jointly filed a Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Doc. 9, Mot. The Motion seeks\ndismissal on the basis that Plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the ACA and implementing\nregulations and that the issues raised within the Complaint are nonjusticiable as they are not yet ripe.\nId. Following the parties’ substantial briefing, the Court requested and received supplemental briefing\non several key issues.6 Docs. 42, 49, and 50. The Motion has now been fully briefed. By prior Order,\nthis Court denied without prejudice a motion (doc. 12) by the American Center for Law and Justice\nand seventy-nine Members of the United States Congress to appear as amicus curiae, concluding that\nthe named parties adequately and sufficiently presented the arguments and perspectives relevant to\nthe Motion to Dismiss and that the Movants’ proposed amicus curiae brief would not further assist\n6During the supplemental briefing period, the government issued the NPRM. The Court did not\nrequest further briefing, though Defendants applied the NPRM to this case in their additional brief. Doc. 49.\n- 10 -\n\nthe Court in resolving the issues at hand. Doc. 17.\nII.\nLEGAL STANDARDS\nFederal courts have the power to decide only actual cases or controversies. U.S. Const. art.\nIII, § 2; Chafin v. Chafin, __ U.S. __, No. 11-1347, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 1122, at *12-13 (Feb. 19,\n2013). “The justiciability doctrines of standing, mootness, political question, and ripeness all\noriginate in Article III’s case or controversy language.” Choice Inc. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 715\n(5th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendants base their Motion to Dismiss for\nLack of Jurisdiction on Plaintiff’s alleged lack of standing and the nonjusticiability of Plaintiff’s unripe\nclaims. Standing and ripeness are required elements of subject matter jurisdiction and are therefore\nproperly challenged on a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. See Xerox Corp.\nv. Genmoora Corp., 888 F.2d 345, 350 (5th Cir. 1989); WesternGeco L.L.C. v. Ion Geophysical Corp.,\n776 F. Supp. 2d 342, 350 (S.D. Tex. 2011). A court must dismiss a case for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) where it lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate\nthe case.  Home Builders Ass’n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, 143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir. 1998).\nA party moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) may bring either a “facial” or “factual”\nattack on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 412 (5th\nCir. 1981); see Barrett Computer Servs., Inc. v. PDA, Inc., 884 F.2d 214, 220 n.5 (5th Cir. 1989).\nDefendants here base their jurisdictional contest on the face of Plaintiff’s Complaint. Doc. 9, Mot.\nat 10-11. When a facial attack is raised against subject matter jurisdiction, “the plaintiff is left with\nsafeguards similar to those retained when a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a\nclaim is raised–the court must consider the allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint as true.”\n- 11 -\n\nWilliamson, 645 F.2d at 412; King v. Life Sch., 809 F. Supp. 2d 572, 577 (N.D. Tex. 2011).\nAccordingly, the Court treats Plaintiff’s allegations as true, but disregards legal conclusions couched\nas statements of fact. See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986). It is the party invoking\njurisdiction, and not the party moving for dismissal, who bears the burden to establish the court’s\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992); In re Eckstein\nMarine Serv., 672 F.3d 310, 314 (5th Cir. 2012).\nIII.\nANALYSIS\nThe government moves to dismiss this action on standing and ripeness grounds. The Court\naddresses each issue, in turn, below.\nA. Standing\nThe standing inquiry is a threshold jurisdictional issue and focuses on the ability of a\nparticular party to bring claims before a federal court, not on the issues on which adjudication is\nsought. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). The standing doctrine is in place to ensure that\n“there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the\ncomplaining party” because, “[w]here that need does not exist, allowing courts to oversee legislative\nor executive action would significantly alter the allocation of power away from a democratic form of\ngovernment.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (internal quotation marks and\nalteration omitted). For Article III standing to exist, three fundamental constitutional prerequisites\nmust be satisfied: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury must have a\ncausal connection to the defendant’s conduct, and (3) it must be likely, and not merely speculative,\nthat the injury suffered will be redressed by a decision favorable to the plaintiff. Defenders of Wildlife,\n- 12 -\n\n504 U.S. at 560-61. Certain prudential requirements also bear on the question of standing. Valley\nForge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474-75\n(1982). A party may not raise claims on behalf of third-parties not before the court or complain of\ngeneralized grievances, and the complainant must fall within the zones of injury and interest\ncontemplated by the statute or constitutional provision at issue. Id.; Apache Bend Apartments, Ltd.\nv. United States, 987 F.2d 1174, 1176 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc). These constitutional and prudential\nlimitations exist in injunctive and declaratory relief cases. Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2041\n(2011); MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 126-27 (2007); Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.\nA plaintiff’s standing to bring a cause of action is assessed at the time the suit was filed. Davis\nv. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (“While the proof required to establish standing increases as the\nsuit proceeds, the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had\nthe requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed.” (citing cases)); Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. at 571 n.4 (noting the Court’s “longstanding rule that jurisdiction is to be assessed under the\nfacts existing when the complaint is filed”); Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 870 (5th Cir.\n2000). Events that occur subsequent to the filing of a complaint will not prevent a plaintiff from\nestablishing standing which existed at the time of the pleadings. See Smith v. Sperling, 354 U.S. 91,\n93 (1957)(“It is quite clear, that the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the state of things at the\ntime of the action brought, and that after vesting, it cannot be ousted by subsequent events.” (citing\nMollan v. Torrance, 22 U.S. 537, 539 n.1 (1824))); Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. v. K N Energy, Inc., 498\nU.S. 426, 428 (1991) (“We have consistently held that if jurisdiction exists at the time an action is\ncommenced, such jurisdiction may not be divested by subsequent events.”); Carr v. Alta Verde Indus.,\nInc., 931 F.2d 1055, 1061 (5th Cir. 1991); see also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.\n- 13 -\n\n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189-92 (2000) (comparing standing with the doctrine of mootness, which\nis affected by subsequent events).\nThe government does not challenge Plaintiff’s ability to demonstrate the traceability or\nredressability elements of the constitutional standing doctrine, nor does it argue against Plaintiff’s\nprudential standing. The sole inquiry is whether Plaintiff has actually suffered or will imminently\nsuffer an injury in fact from Defendants’ enactment of the ACA and implementing regulations.\nAn “injury in fact” is an injury that is both “concrete and particularized” and “actual or\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560. “A party facing\nprospective injury has standing to sue where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct.”\nDavis, 554 U.S. at 734 (citing Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983)). “A plaintiff who\nchallenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the\nstatute’s operation or enforcement. But one does not have to await the consummation of threatened\ninjury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.” Babbitt v. UFW\nNat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks and alternations omitted).\nPlaintiff explicitly advances two injuries upon which it has standing for all of its claims: its\nimminent injury in the form of future impairment of its First Amendment rights and actual injury\nin the form of the inability to prepare its 2014 health plan. Doc. 13, Resp. at 9-16. The Court also\ndiscerns allegations of a third injury: the actual or imminent injury arising from several of the APA\nclaims. The Court addresses the sufficiency of each of these alleged injuries, in turn, below.\n1. Imminent Injury from Enforcement of the ACA\nPlaintiff alleges in its pleadings that enforcement of the ACA and implementing regulations\nwill cause imminent injury to Plaintiff in the form of burdening and interfering with its exercise of\n- 14 -\n\nreligion and right of free speech. See, e.g., doc. 1., Compl. ¶¶ 130, 140-141, 181. Defendant insists\nthat the ACA’s implementing regulations are undergoing amendment to address the very concerns\nraised by Plaintiff, so it is unlikely that Plaintiff will be required to comply with the ACA or suffer\nthe alleged imminent injuries to its First Amendment rights.7\nAs an initial matter, Plaintiff surmises that the substance of Defendants’ Motion applies only\nto some of its regulatory challenges but not to its challenges to the religious employer exemption.\nDoc. 13, Resp. at 7-8.  Plaintiff basis its belief on language from the ANPRM, which it construes to\nreject the possibility of an amendment to the religious employer exemption. Id. The Court does not\nagree with Plaintiff’s interpretation of the ANPRM as foreclosing amendment to the exemption.\nAccordingly, the government’s arguments are certainly relevant to all of Plaintiff’s causes of action.\nSome courts have decided that entities lack standing to challenge the ACA on the basis that\nthey will not suffer imminent injury due to their grandfathered or exempt status. See Catholic Diocese\nof Peoria, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1261, at *12-13 (decided on ripeness grounds but concluding that\ngrandfathered status would probably prevent standing); Nebraska, 877 F. Supp. 2d at 791 (requiring\nplaintiffs to plead specific facts that they are not grandfathered and therefore subject to the\nrequirements that are alleged to cause them injury); Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y., 2012 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 172695, at *35-36 (dismissing two plaintiffs because they were protected under the\ngrandfather clause). As an initial matter, the parties agree that Plaintiff is not protected by the\n7Plaintiff opines that Defendants confuse the doctrine of standing with mootness, because the effect\nof the “potential for change in the law raises only a mootness question.” Doc. 13, Resp. at 16 n.19.\nDefendants prevail upon the Court to “reject plaintiff’s attempts to recast defendants’ jurisdictional arguments\nas questions of mootness” because this case “raises quintessential standing and ripeness questions.” Doc. 16,\nReply at 15 n.11. The Court agrees with Defendants in that their Motion properly invokes Plaintiff’s standing\nto sue and the ripeness of Plaintiff’s pleadings but not mootness.\n- 15 -\n\ngrandfather clause and thus is not exempted from the ACA coverage requirements on that basis. 26\nC.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i) (Treasury); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a)(1)(i)(Labor); 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.140(a)(1)(i)(HHS). But, Plaintiff has not plead whether it believes it is a religious employer\nprotected by the exemption clause, 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B). Indeed, Plaintiff submits that\nit is “unclear” whether it will qualify for the exemption. Doc. 1, Compl. ¶ 38. The government also\nrefuses to take a position on the issue. Doc. 9, Br. at 14 n.8 (noting Plaintiff’s uncertainty as to the\napplication of the exemption, but arguing that this “concern is irrelevant at this stage” in light of the\nsafe harbor provision). The Court observed that, under the ANPRM, which is not binding law, the\ngovernment contemplates a “Catholic diocese,” specifically, as qualifying for the religious employer\nexemption. 77 Fed. Reg. at 16,502. Thus, despite the reasoning supporting Plaintiff’s concern that\nit may not qualify as a “religious employer,” there appeared to the Court a distinct possibility that\nPlaintiff might qualify for the exemption. The Court requested supplemental briefing from the parties\non whether the fact that neither party knows if Plaintiff is protected by the currently-enacted\nreligious employer exemption is itself a contingency that affects Plaintiff’s ability to establish the\nimminence of injury.8 Doc. 42, Order at 2 (citing Clinton v. City of N.Y., 524 U.S. 417, 430-31\n8The Court also requested the parties’ positions on how an entity qualifies under the religious\nemployer exemption, i.e., whether the entity must apply for the exemption or self-certify as exempt. Doc. 42,\nOrder at 2. The government clarified that no application or self-certification for exemption is required, but\nrather that an employer who qualifies under the requirement “is simply exempt.” Doc. 49, Supp. Br. at 2;\nChase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, 131 S. Ct. 871, 880 (2011) (“Under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997),\nwe defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation, advanced in a legal brief, unless that\ninterpretation is ‘plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.’”). Plaintiff responded that it has\nalleged that the exemption is unconstitutional regardless of the method of administration, doc. 50, Supp. Br.\nat 3, but that argument is inconsistent with its pleadings, as several of the causes of action explicitly invoke\nthe certainty of an “intrusive and potentially costly governmental investigation into whether, in the\nGovernment’s view,” Plaintiff is a “religious employer” and thus exempt.  See, e.g., doc. 1, Compl. ¶ 11.\nFurther, in light of the government’s explanation of the administration of the exemption, it appears that\nPlaintiff need not submit to any investigative process. In any event, Plaintiff has challenged the regulations\n- 16 -\n\n(1998); ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 593-94 (7th Cir. 2012); Comsat v. FCC, 250 F.3d 931, 936\n(5th Cir. 2001)).\nThe issue was substantially clarified by the parties’ additional briefs. Plaintiff convincingly\ncompared this case to Clinton v. City of New York, in which the Supreme Court rejected the\ngovernment’s contention that a pending application for an exemption from the Balanced Budget Act\naffected the plaintiff’s ability to challenge the potential, immediate liability otherwise imposed by that\nlaw. 524 U.S. at 430-31. Here, the fact that the parties are unclear whether Plaintiff will fall under\nthe religious employer exemption as currently enacted–and the fact that Plaintiff failed to take a\nstand in its pleadings on whether it is exempt–should similarly have no effect on Plaintiff’s ability to\nchallenge its potential liability under the ACA. Further, Plaintiff points out that it is the very nature\nof pre-enforcement lawsuits that enforcement of a law against the complainant is simply a possibility\nof enforcement, see ACLU, 679 F.3d at 593, which is the case here given that the government has\nnot foresworn the possibility that Plaintiff will ultimately be required to provide preventive services\ncoverage in violation of its touted religious beliefs. Finally, Plaintiff rightfully suggests that “it would\nbe fundamentally unfair to require a litigant to subject itself to an unconstitutional regulation before\nallowing the litigant to establish standing.” Doc. 50, Supp. Br. at 9. The Court is convinced, based\non the parties’ supplemental briefing, that their uncertainty as to whether Plaintiff would be exempt\nin part under the expectation that the fact that it serves and employs individuals outside of its faith\ndisqualifies  it  from  being  exempt  under  the  second  and  third  requirements  of  45  C.F.R.  §\n147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B). And, of course, even if Plaintiff accepts the government’s statement that it can\nconsider itself exempt, Plaintiff would always be subject to later review by the agencies, who would ultimately\ndetermine whether Plaintiff appropriately complied with the regulations.\n- 17 -\n\nfrom the regulation is not a contingency that itself affects Plaintiff’s ability to establish standing.9\nBecause Plaintiff’s health plan is not grandfathered and because Plaintiff believes it may not\nqualify as an exempt religious employer, Plaintiff contends that enforcement of the ACA and its\nimplementing regulations is likely and that the harm to Plaintiff’s religious exercise and free speech\nis imminent. These alleged imminent harms are sufficient to confer standing to sue. Davis, 554 U.S.\nat 734; Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560. Nonetheless, it has been the government’s contention\nthat, even if Plaintiff is not shielded from the ACA coverage requirements under the religious\nemployer exemption, the Court should decide that Plaintiff’s injury is not imminent because the\nregulations are in the process of being amended to address the very concerns Plaintiff raises in its\npleadings. Doc. 9, Br. at 1-2. According to the government, the promise of these changes is evident\nby a combination of (1) the publication of the ANPRM, (2) the implementation of the temporary\nenforcement safe harbor, and (3) the government’s own representations to this Court and others.\nId.\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff that publication of the ANPRM is insufficient to undermine\nthe imminence of Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. The ANPRM merely states that the government \nexpects to address concerns similar to those raised by Plaintiff and solicits comment on the same. 77\nFed. Reg. 16,501. The ANPRM is not a proposed amendment and does not proffer contents or\n9This analysis differs slightly from other courts’ requirements that plaintiffs plead specific facts\nshowing that they are not exempt by way of the grandfather clause. See, e.g., Nebraska, 877 F. Supp. 2d at __,\n2012 U.S. Dist LEXIS 104419, at *39-40. That distinction, however, may be necessary because the\ngrandfather clause presents an objective inquiry, whereas the religious employer exemption appears to be fluid\nand subjective. Furthermore, Plaintiff does not challenge the process of determining whether an entity is\nexempt as grandfathered, but it explicitly challenges the actual means necessary for it and/or the government\nto determine whether it is an exempt religious employer. The Court concludes that these distinctions explain\nthe disparate pleading requirements.\n- 18 -\n\nsubstance of a proposed amendment. There is no concrete evidence to indicate that the government\nis reversing its course. See API v. EPA, 683 F.3d 382, 388 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Although the Court\ncannot say that every ANPRM would be insufficient to indicate a shift in administrative policy, the\nANPRM relevant to this case provides no specifics to quash Plaintiff’s fear of enforcement or to\ndisprove the imminence of Plaintiff’s injury upon enforcement of the current, final regulations.\nLike the ANPRM, the safe harbor provision also does not alter the substantive coverage\nrequirements or prevent enforcement indefinitely. 77 Fed. Reg. 8725. Instead, it merely postpones\nenforcement of the final regulations for a short period of time, until Plaintiff’s new plan period begins\non January 1, 2014. “Where the inevitability of the operation of a statute against certain individuals\nis patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay\nbefore the disputed provisions will come into effect.” Reg’l Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S.\n102, 143 (1974); see New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 175 (1992); Thomas v. Union Carbide\nAgric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 581 (1985); Pierce v. Soc’y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 536 (1925);\nThomas More Law Ctr. v. Obama, 651 F.3d 529, 537 (6th Cir. 2011). Further, the temporary safe\nharbor provision at issue here is a mere public statement and has not been made official or binding\nthrough codification. See Va. Soc’y for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, 263 F.3d 379, 388 (4th Cir.\n2001)(holding that a “policy of nonenforcement, adopted by the [agency] in a closed meeting, is\nsomewhat more formal than [a] promise made during litigation” but that, on the other hand, the\n“policy is not contained in a final rule that underwent the rigors of notice and comment rulemaking”\nand “do[es] not carry the binding force of law”). Although the temporary enforcement safe harbor\nmay provide some support for the promises made in the ANPRM, it is not enough to undermine a\nplaintiff’s standing when no law or tangible proposed amendment exists that would indicate that the\n- 19 -\n\nplaintiff will be beyond the reach of enforcement of the current law. \nMore troubling to the Court is the government’s third contention that its promises of future\nnon-enforcement against Plaintiff are sufficient to  prove that Plaintiff has no standing to challenge\nthe current law. See doc. 49, Supp. Br. at 3; doc. 31-1, Resp. at 3-4 (representing “that the\ngovernment will never enforce [the regulations] in their current form against the plaintiff here”). The\ngovernment suggests, and several other federal courts have agreed, see, e.g., Wheaton Coll., 703 F.3d\nat __, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 26716, at *7-9, that if the government makes a statement before the\nCourt that the regulations in their current form will “almost certainly” never be enforced against\nPlaintiff or that the amended regulations will address all of Plaintiff’s concerns, the Court may take\nthat representation as an eternal, factual truth, and the Plaintiff must rely upon that promise. See,\ne.g., doc. 16, Reply at 4. But a string of promises does not an actuality make. First, the government’s\npolicies, plans, and representatives could change or cease to exist at any time.  “[T]here is nothing\nthat prevents the State from changing its mind. It is not forever bound, by estoppel or otherwise, to\nthe view of the law that it asserts in this litigation.” Vt. Right to Life Comm. v. Sorrell, 221 F.3d 376,\n383 (2d Cir. 2000) (dismissing an argument that a plaintiff lacked standing “because the State has\nno intention” of enforcing the law against the plaintiff); N.H. Right to Life PAC v. Gardner, 99 F.3d\n8, 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding a credible threat of prosecution where “nothing prevents the\nCommission from enforcing its rule at any time with, perhaps, another change of mind of one of the\nCommission,” despite a promise of nonenforcement made by the state during litigation (citing\nChamber of Commerce v. FEC, 69 F.3d 600, 603 (D.C. Cir. 1995))); Eckles v. City of Corydon, 341\nF.3d 762, 768 (8th Cir. 2003). Second, the substance of the government’s statement is empty. The\ngovernment has not said, for example, that it will never require Plaintiff to provide contraceptives\n- 20 -\n\nor other preventive services abhorrent to Plaintiff. The government could amend the regulations in\na way that has no bearing on Plaintiff’s concerns and then enforce the coverage provisions against\nPlaintiff without violating its promise that the regulations “in their current form” would not be\nenforced against Plaintiff.10 Courts may afford deference to some government representations made\nbefore a court. See Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 2009) (“Without\nevidence to the contrary, we assume that formally announced changes to official governmental policy\nare not mere litigation posturing.”). But representations of this nature–extremely broad and lacking\nsubstance–should never be enough to strip a plaintiff of standing. In Abbot Laboratories v. Garden, the\nSupreme Court noted its skepticism of government representations that attempted to diminish the\nplaintiff’s standing to challenge a provision for criminal sanctions under the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act:\nThe  Government  further  contends  that  the  threat  of  criminal  sanctions  for\nnoncompliance with a judicially untested regulation is unrealistic; the Solicitor\nGeneral  has  represented  that  if  court  enforcement  becomes  necessary,  “the\nDepartment  of  Justice  will  proceed  only  civilly  for  an  injunction  or  by\ncondemnation.” We cannot accept this argument as a sufficient answer to petitioners’\npetition. This action at its inception was properly brought and this subsequent\nrepresentation of the Department of Justice should not suffice to defeat it.\n387 U.S. 136, 154 (1967)(internal alteration omitted). The Court concludes that the government’s\nunimpressive representations that the current regulations will never be enforced against Plaintiff and\nthat amended regulations will be issued and will likely address Plaintiff’s concerns are too broad,\nunspecific, and unsupported to entice this Court to conclude that Plaintiffs will not be imminently\n10The government has apparently declined to enter into a binding, enforceable stipulation with\nPlaintiff in this case to promise that it will not require Plaintiff to cover contraception and other preventive\nservices for its employees. Doc. 50-1, Proposed Stipulation. \n- 21 -\n\ninjured upon enforcement of the current regulations.\nDefendants’ supplemental briefing suggests that the NPRM has bearing on Plaintiff’s\nstanding. Doc. 49, Supp. Br. at 4. While true that Defendants made good on their promise to issue\nproposed amendments, the NPRM was published after the filing of this case and therefore has no\nbearing on whether Plaintiff adequately alleged its standing to sue. See Davis, 554 U.S. at 734. As\nexplained above, the Court must turn a blind eye to the benefit of hindsight when analyzing a\nplaintiff’s standing to sue. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff has established an imminent\ninjury to its First Amendment rights.\n2. Actual Injury of Ability to Plan\nPlaintiff also alleges that it has suffered an actual, present injury in its inability to plan ahead\nto determine the required scope of its self-insured health plan coverage. Doc. 13, Resp. at 6, 13.\nPlaintiff insists that the ANPRM “does not relieve the burden and costs of planning and preparing\nfor the current law, nor the present uncertainty that has affected and is affecting the Diocese’s\noperations” and thus that the ACA imposes a “present impact” on Plaintiff. Id. at 13. Injuries related\nto planning for future laws or similar legal contingencies are not often sufficient to establish standing.\n“Mere economic uncertainty affecting the plaintiff’s planning is not sufficient to support premature\nreview.” Wilmac Corp. v. Bowen, 811 F.2d 809, 813 (3d Cir. 1987); Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC,\n736 F.2d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (dismissing Plaintiff’s alleged “planning insecurity”); Bethlehem\nSteel Corp. v. U.S. EPA, 536 F.2d 156, 162 (7th Cir. 1976) (“[C]laims of uncertainty in their business\nand capital planning are not sufficient to warrant our review of an ongoing administrative process.”).\nPlaintiff cites cases that have found actual injury based on the necessity of preparation, but\nthose cases are distinguishable from and much more compelling than the facts plead here. Further,\n- 22 -\n\nPlaintiff admits that it has not decided whether it will simply pay the fines for violating the ACA\nrather than provide the required health coverage, whether it will overhaul its organizational structure\nto qualify as a religious employer, or whether it will provide the mandated coverage despite its\nreligious beliefs. Doc. 1, Compl. ¶¶ 118-122. Although Plaintiff alleges that it “requires time to\nbudget for any such additional expenses” should it choose to pay the fines and penalties and not\nprovide coverage, see id. ¶ 121; doc. 13, Resp. at 14-15, that course of action would not involve the\nsort of planning hardship that some cases have recognized as adequate to confer standing. See, e.g.,\nPNGTS Shippers’ Group v. FERC, 592 F.3d 132, 138 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (distinguishing Great Lakes\nGas Transmission Co. v. FERC, 984 F.2d 426, 431 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). Accordingly, the Court\ndiscounts Plaintiff’s alleged preparation injury as a basis for its standing.\n3. Injury Related to APA Violations\nFinally, Plaintiff implicitly pleads injury related to Defendants’ alleged violations of the APA\n(Counts VII, VIII, and IX of the Complaint). Plaintiff does not detail its standing to bring the APA\nclaims, because Plaintiff maintains that Defendants’ Motion does not challenge standing on those\ncauses of action. Doc. 13, Resp. at 7. The Court disagrees with Plaintiff’s characterization of the\nscope of Defendant’s Motion. Defendant’s arguments are certainly relevant to Counts VIII and IX\nbecause an amendment to the regulations may dispose of any allegations that the definition of\n“religious employer” is not in harmony with other federal laws or that the “preventive services”\nincludes abortions. In any event, Defendant explicitly certifies that its Motion was intended to apply\nto all causes of action raised in the pleadings, doc. 16, Reply at 15, so the Court will consider its\nMotion as applying to the APA claims.\n“Agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no\n- 23 -\n\nother adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. At the time Plaintiff\nfiled its lawsuit, the ACA implementing regulations were final because they were implemented with\nan effective enforcement date and because no actual proposed amendment had been issued which\nwould contradict the final agency policy. The Court agrees that Plaintiff has standing with respect\nto the APA claims (Counts VII, VIII, and IX) because the alleged procedural rulemaking violations\nultimately led to a preventive care regulation that is claimed to violate several rights held by Plaintiff.\nAs noted above, the Court may not consider the post-pleading NPRM as evidence that the\nregulations are not final.\nIn conclusion, the Court determines that, at the time Plaintiff filed this suit in August 2012,\nPlaintiff  had  standing  to  challenge  the  injury  imminent  to  it  upon  commencement  of  the\nenforcement of final regulations in their current form.\nB. Ripeness\nGiven that Plaintiff has established its standing to bring this lawsuit, the Court turns to the\ngovernment’s alternative argument that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the case\nbecause the issues raised within the Complaint are not yet ripe. Doc. 9, Mot. at 15. Although\nPlaintiff protests that the Motion does not apply to several of its claims, see doc. 13, Resp. at 7, the\nCourt has already rejected that argument and applies its ripeness analysis to this entire declaratory\naction.\nThe Fifth Circuit has recognized that although “applying the ripeness doctrine in the\ndeclaratory judgment context presents a unique challenge . . . , a declaratory judgment action, like\nany other action, must be ripe in order to be justiciable.” Orix Credit Alliance, Inc. v. Wolfe, 212 F.3d\n891, 896 (5th Cir. 2000); Roark & Hardee LP v. City of Austin, 522 F.3d 533, 544 (5th Cir. 2008)\n- 24 -\n\n(“[A] ripeness inquiry is often required when a party is seeking pre-enforcement review of a law or\nregulation.”); Wright v. Spindletop Films, L.L.C., 830 F. Supp. 2d 280, 284 (S.D. Tex. 2011). A federal\ncourt may exercise jurisdiction over an actual controversy, but not premature or speculative issues.\nShields v. Norton, 289 F.3d 832, 835 (5th Cir. 2002). “As a general rule, an actual controversy exists\nwhere ‘a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality exists between parties having\nadverse legal interests.’” Orix, 212 F.3d at 896 (citing Middle S. Energy, Inc. v. City of New Orleans,\n800 F.2d 488, 490 (5th Cir. 1986) (internal alteration omitted)). A case is ripe for adjudication if\nall remaining questions are legal and further factual development is unnecessary. New Orleans Pub.\nServ., Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, 833 F.2d 583, 587 (5th Cir. 1987). A claim is not ripe\nif it is “rests upon ‘contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not\noccur at all.’” Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (citations omitted).\nThe ripeness and standing inquiries are related in that they both share the constitutional\nprerequisite of imminent injury. Prestage Farms, Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 205 F.3d 265, 268 n.7 (5th\nCir. 2000)(“The justiciability doctrines of ripeness and standing often intersect because the question\nof whether a plaintiff has suffered an adequate harm is integral to both.”); WesternGeco L.L.C., 776\nF. Supp. 2d at 351 (“In determining hardship, the doctrine of ripeness overlaps with the doctrine of\nstanding’s examination of whether a plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Nonetheless, ripeness and standing serve separate and distinct purposes, and it is\npossible for claim to be unripe despite the existence of standing to raise that claim. See, e.g., S. Utah\nWilderness Alliance v. Palma, No. 11-4094, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 464 (10th Cir. Jan. 8, 2013);\nWheaton Coll., 703 F.3d at 551 (deciding a similar ACA challenge). When compared with standing:\nThis kindred doctrine [of ripeness] shifts to a temporal focus, timing review to secure\n- 25 -\n\na fit of controversy and judicial resolution. Ripeness considers the fluidity of the\nevents defining the dispute, such as whether the claim rests upon facts yet airborne\nor sufficiently upon facts that have found ground. It then balances the hardship of\nwithholding decision and the fitness of the case for judicial resolution. Courts work\nbest with historical facts and often must wait until history is determinable.\nBrooklyn Union Gas Co. v. FERC, 190 F.3d 369, 373 (5th Cir. 1999). Ripeness is thus “an even closer\nquestion” than standing, because “[i]ts resolution is informed by additional circumstances that\nawaiting [further development of the case] may mitigate if not cure.” Id. at 374. In simple terms,\n“standing is concerned with whether a proper party is bringing suit, while ripeness is concerned with\nwhether the suit is being brought at the proper time.” Texas, 497 F.3d at 496.\nAccordingly, “[r]ipeness is a justiciability doctrine designed ‘to prevent the courts, through\navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over\nadministrative  policies,  and  also  to  protect  the  agencies  from  judicial  interference  until  an\nadministrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging\nparties.’” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. DOI, 538 U.S. 803, 807 (2003) (citing Abbott Labs., 387 U.S.\nat 148-49); Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998); Cent. & S.W. Servs. v. EPA,\n220 F.3d 683, 690 (5th Cir. 2000). The ripeness doctrine is designed to serve as “a tool that courts\nmay use to enhance the accuracy of their decisions and to avoid becoming embroiled in adjudications\nthat may later turn out to be unnecessary or may require premature examination of, especially,\nconstitutional issues that time may make easier or less controversial.” Simmonds v. INS, 326 F.3d 351,\n357 (2d Cir. 2003).\n“Ripeness doctrine ‘is drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from\nprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.’” Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs,\n697 F.3d 279, 286 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 58 n.18\n- 26 -\n\n(1993)); Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.S. 662 n.2 (2010)(“Ripeness reflects\nconstitutional considerations that implicate Article III limitations on judicial power, as well as\nprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see\nRosedale Missionary Baptist Church v. New Orleans City, 641 F.3d 86, 88-89 (5th Cir. 2011); Allandale\nNeighborhood Ass’n  v. Austin Transp. Study Policy Advisory Comm., 840 F.2d 258 (5th Cir. 1988).\n“[W]hen a court declares that a case is not prudentially ripe, it means that the case will be better\ndecided later not that the case is not a real or concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns\nof the parties.” Connecticut v. Duncan, 612 F.3d 107, 113-14 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal alterations\nomitted).\nWhile standing to sue is assessed at the time of filing the complaint, “[i]n determining\nripeness, a court may consider events that occurred after the filing of the complaint.” Newark Branch,\nNAACP v. Millburn Township, No. 89-4219, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17559, at *11 (D.N.J. Dec. 27,\n1990) (citing cases);  Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. United Furnace Co., 876 F.2d 293, 302 n.4 (2d Cir.\n1989); Henley v. Herring, 779 F.2d 1553, 1555 (11th Cir. 1986). Courts reviewing decisions on\nripeness frequently take into consideration the development of facts after the filing of the complaint\nand even after a decision issued by a lower court on the matter. See, e.g., Reg’l Rail Reorganization Act\nCases, 419 U.S. at 140 (“[S]ince ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing, it is the situation now\nrather than the situation at the time of the District Court’s decision that must govern.”); Anderson\nv.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 114 (1976); Roark & Hardee, 522\nF.3d at 544-45.\nTwo key considerations exist for courts evaluating the ripeness of an action: “the fitness of\nthe issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.”\n- 27 -\n\nNew Orleans Pub. Serv., 833 F.2d at 586 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149); Choice, 691 F.3d\nat 715; Placid Oil Co. v. FERC, 666 F.2d 976, 981 (5th Cir. 1982). “Both aspects of the inquiry\ninvolve the exercise of judgment, rather than the application of a black-letter rule.” Nat’l Park\nHospitality, 538 U.S. at 814 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n1. Fitness of Issues for Decision\nThe first prong of the ripeness analysis is whether the issues are fit for judicial review. Texas,\n497 F.3d at 496. “A challenge to administrative regulations is fit for review if (1) the questions\npresented are ‘purely legal ones,’ (2) the challenged regulations constitute ‘final agency action,’ and\n(3) further factual development would not ‘significantly advance the court’s ability to deal with the\nlegal issues presented.’” Id. at 498-99 (citing Nat’l Park Hospitality, 538 U.S. at 812) (internal\nalterations omitted). “The baseline question is whether allowing more time for development of events\nwould significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues presented or aid us in their\nresolution.” Doe v. Bush, 323 F.3d 133, 138 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). \nThe parties agree that the issues in this case are primarily legal. Doc. 9, Mot. at 19; doc. 13,\nResp. at 17. They disagree as to the finality of the regulations. Although the ACA regulations are\nfinal in that they are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, courts must be “flexible” and\n“interpret[] the ‘finality’ element in a pragmatic way.” Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149-50. The\nANPRM and temporary safe harbor period could not dissuade the Court from concluding that\nPlaintiff sufficiently alleged imminent injury, but those facts certainly weigh in favor of finding that\nthe case is not realistically ready for review. The promulgation of the NPRM, however, urges the\nundeniable conclusion that the case is not ripe. See Ohio Forestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. at 735 (concluding\n- 28 -\n\nthat a challenge to an agency plan was not ripe because “the possibility that further consideration\nwill actually occur before the [p]lan is implemented is not theoretical, but real” due to, inter alia, a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking containing proposed amendments to the plan). “It would hardly be\nsound stewardship of judicial resources to decide this case now . . . given that an already published\nproposed rule, if enacted, would dispense with the need for such an opinion in a matter of months.”\nAPI, 683 F.3d at 387-88 (holding that a challenge to a promulgated rule was not ripe because a\nproposed amendment to the rule was pending). That the enforcement of the current regulations\n“may never come to pass augurs against a finding of fitness.” Doe, 323 F.3d at 139 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Toca Producers v. FERC, 411 F.3d 262, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (finding that an\nagency’s action was final and the case presented purely legal issues, but holding that the case was not\nripe). The proposed amendments, if adopted, spill into every aspect of the present case and constitute\n“reversal of course on [the agency’s] part that, if adopted, would necessitate substantively different\nlegal analysis and would likely moot the analysis we could undertake if deciding the case now.” API,\n683 F.3d at 388-89; Ohio Forestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. 735-36. The NPRM makes the ripeness analysis\nhere more compelling than that of the other courts reviewing ACA challenges prior to the issuance\nof an actual, proposed amendment.\nAlthough the issue was not addressed in any detail by the parties, the Court contemplates\nthe distinction between the ripeness of Plaintiff’s substantive claims, which will each evolve with the\nNPRM, and of Plaintiff’s single procedural claim. In Count VII of its Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that\nDefendant violated the APA’s notice-and-comment rulemaking procedure when it implemented the\nregulations and that Plaintiff suffered immediate injury upon its inability to comment. Doc. 1, Compl.\nat ¶¶ 198-210; doc. 13, Resp. at 8. Although the NPRM may impose a lesser impact on the ripeness\n- 29 -\n\nof the procedural claim compared with the other APA, First Amendment, and RFRA claims, the\nproposed amendments nonetheless illustrate that the challenged regulations are simply interlocutory.\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (holding that an agency action is final where it is not\n“merely tentative” or of an “interlocutory nature”); Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797\n(1992) (concluding that an agency action is final where “its impact is sufficiently direct and\nimmediate,” where it has “a direct effect on day-to-day business,” and where it is not “tentative”\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Finality is required even for claims that an\nagency failed to follow the notice-and-comment procedures. See, e.g., Anchorage v. United States, 980\nF.2d 1320, 1324-25 (9th Cir. 1992). As such, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s procedural APA\nclaim is also not fit.\nIn light of the NPRM, and in viewing the fitness of the issues for consideration in a realistic\nand pragmatic way, the Court concludes that the case is not fit for review at this time.\n2. Hardship to Plaintiff Absent Consideration\nThe Court next turns to the issue of whether Plaintiff will suffer hardship if the Court\nwithholds its consideration of the issues raised in its pleadings. “The Supreme Court has found\nhardship to inhere in legal harms, such as the harmful creation of legal rights or obligations; practical\nharms on the interests advanced by the party seeking relief; and the harm of being forced to modify\none’s behavior in order to avoid future adverse consequences.” Texas, 497 F.3d at 499 (citing Ohio\nForestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. at 734 (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted)); Choice, 691 F.3d\nat 715. In order to constitute a hardship, the impact of the regulations must be “sufficiently direct,”\nresulting in an “immediate and significant change in the plaintiffs’ conduct.” Abbott Labs., 387 U.S.\nat 152-53.\n- 30 -\n\nDefendants insist that there will be no hardship to Plaintiff if the case is dismissed on ripeness\ngrounds, because the amendments to the regulations are not yet clear and because Plaintiff may\nnever be subject to the objected-to requirements under the ACA. Defendants suggest that the only\nhardship “arises from plaintiff’s own desire to prepare for a hypothetical (and unlikely) situation in\nwhich  the forthcoming amendments to the preventive services  coverage regulations  do  not\nsufficiently address its religious concerns.” Doc. 9, Mot. at 21. Further, because the temporary\nenforcement safe harbor currently protects Plaintiff, enforcement of the regulations–in whatever form\nthey may be–will not occur until January 1, 2014 if the safe harbor period is honored. Id. Thus,\nDefendant avers that Plaintiff will suffer no hardship absent the present resolution of its claims,\nbecause it is not yet facing a situation where it will be forced to choose between its religious beliefs\nor compliance with the regulations. Id.\nPlaintiff responds that it will suffer an immediate hardship because it will be unable to\nsufficiently plan its compliance with the regulations in that it will have inadequate time to make\neffective decisions with respect to its insurance coverage. Doc. 13, Resp. at 22. Plaintiff declares that\nthis “planning hardship” is real and tips the balance in favor of immediate adjudication. Id. (citing\nMiller v. Brown, 462 F.3d 312, 321 (4th Cir. 2006); Wis. Pub. Power, Inc. v. FERC, 493 F.3d 239, 263\n(D.C. Cir. 2007)).\nThe Court does not discount the general desire for certainty and long-term planning, but no\ndirect dilemma or Hobson’s choice is faced by Plaintiff now. Plaintiff’s argument “would effectively\ncreate a rule where any future event, however remote or speculative, could constitute a burden when\na plaintiff claims that it must prepare now for this future contingency.” Cephalon, Inc. v. Sebelius, 796\nF. Supp. 2d 212, 218 (D.D.C. 2011). As the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has explained,\n- 31 -\n\n“[w]ere we to entertain anticipatory challenges pressed by parties facing no imminent threat of\nadverse agency action, no hard choice between compliance certain to be disadvantageous and a high\nprobability of strong sanctions, we would venture away from the domain of judicial review into a\nrealm more accurately described as judicial preview.” Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., 736 F.2d at 751. For\nthe same reasons this Court found that the “planning hardship” did not constitute an actual injury\nunder the standing inquiry, the inability to prepare for contingencies is not a hardship that outweighs\nthe unfitness for review of the issues in this case. Importantly, Plaintiff will be able to raise its claims\nin the future, when a regulation is final or when enforcement is initiated, and Plaintiff has an\nopportunity to participate in the amendment process now.\nAccordingly, because the issues are not prudentially fit for review and because Plaintiff will\nnot suffer hardship should the Court withhold a decision on the merits of this action, the Court\nconcludes that the causes of action in the Complaint are not ripe. Dismissal is the appropriate action\nwhere a claim is not ripe. See Ohio Forestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. at 739 (deciding that the lawsuit was not\nripe for review and remanding with instructions to dismiss it); Colo. Christian Univ., 2013 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 2677, at *27 (observing no compelling support for the D.C. Circuit’s unique historical\npractice of holding some unripe cases in abeyance rather than dismissing them).\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above-stated reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction (doc. 9). The Complaint is dismissed in its\nentirety.\n- 32 -\n\nSO ORDERED.\nSIGNED: February 26, 2013.\n_________________________________\nJANE J. BOYLE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n- 33 -",
