    "summary": "<p>This case was one of 12 cases filed on May 21, 2012, in federal district courts across the country, by non-profit Catholic organizations challenging the ACA's provisions to ensure that employee health insurance covers birth control.  In each, the plaintiffs objected to notifying the government or their health insurer that they were claiming a religious exemption from provision of contraception. That self-certification assisted the government in working with the insurer or health benefits provider to ensure that the plaintiffs' employees would have access to contraception. The employers who filed this group of cases argued that this approach violated their religious liberty because their certification started a chain of events that resulted in their employees receiving contraception. </p><p>This particular case was filed by Bishop Zubik, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh,  and the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.</p><p>(See <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465>Zubik v. Sebelius [II]</a> for the second iteration of this claim, which is in front of the Supreme Court in the spring of 2016; on March 23, 2016, the Supreme Court will hear argument on whether the current regulation violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.)</p><p>In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which requires employers who offer their employeees health insurance to provide coverage of preventive care and screenings for women, without cost sharing (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), following guidelines established by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  In 2012, HHS's regulation was issued, and required covered of were issued, and included “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . . . approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity,” as prescribed by a health care provider. 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R.</p><p>§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv).</p><p>The implementing regulations, issued in February 2012, authorized an exemption from contraceptive coverage for the group health plan of a “religious employer,” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). </p><p>In order to qualify as a “religious employer,” an employer had to meet the following criteria:</p><p> (1) Has the inculcation of religious values as its purpose.</p><p> (2) primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets;</p><p> (3) primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and.</p><p> (4) is a non-profit organized as a church </p><p>At the same time as posting the regulations, HHS established a temporary enforcement “safe-harbor” for group health care plans sponsored by certain non-profit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that did not qualify as religious employers.  Such organizations were required to \"self-certify\" that they satisfied the safe-harbor criteria.  </p><p>On March 21, 2012, HHS published an “advance notice of proposed rulemaking” (“ANPRM”), in which it announced its intention to propose regulatory amendments that “would establish alternative ways to fulfill the requirements of [the ACA] when health coverage is sponsored or arranged by a religious organization that objects to the coverage of contraceptive services for religious reasons and that is not exempt under the final regulations published February 15, 2012.” 77 Fed.Reg. 16,501.</p><p>The plaintiffs asked the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to find that the federal government had violated their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the First and Fifth Amendments, by requiring them to start the process that would provide contraception to their employees. Represented by private counsel, they asked the court to issue a preliminary and  permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement against them of the ACA's contraception mandate or certification requirement. </p><p>On November 27, 2012, the District Court (Judge Terrence F. McVerry) granted the government's motion to dismiss without prejudice for lack of ripeness and standing. 911 F. Supp. 2d 314, 318 (W.D. Pa. 2012). The Court found that since the government was amending the regulation to address the concerns of religious employers, the plaintiffs' claims were not ready for judicial review, particularly since the plaintiff hadn't yet been hurt by the regulations. </p><p>On January 23, 2013, plaintiffs appealed the District Court's order to dismiss. The parties then reached an agreement that was not made public, and on July 23, 2013, a clerk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Marcia M. Waldron) dismissed the case pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 42(b), without cost to either party. </p><p>The final regulation came out in July 2, 2013, On October 8, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a new lawsuit, again in the Western District of Pennsylvania.  See <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465>Zubik v. Sebelius [II]</a>. The Supreme Court will hear that case on March 23, 2016; decision is expected by the end of June 2016.</p>",

On November 27, 2012, the court (Judge Terrence F. McVerry) granted the Federal Government's motion to dismiss for lack of ripeness and standing.

L. No. 111-148, \n124 Stat. 119 (March 23, 2010) (codified as amended in scattered sections of titles 21, 25, 26, 29 \nand 42 of the United States Code), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (March 30, 2010) (codified in scattered \nsections of titles 20, 26, and 42 of the United States Code) (collectively referred to as the \n“Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”) violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), the \nFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The \nWomen’s Health Amendment (“WHA”) to the ACA, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) (March 23, \n2010), requires covered employers to offer group health plans2 that provide women with certain \nforms of preventive services, including “FDA-approved contraception methods” and \ncontraceptive counseling.3   “FDA-approved contraceptive methods” include oral contraceptives, \n“emergency contraceptive” abortifacients (such as Plan “B” and “Ella”), and intrauterine \ndevices.  Legatus v. Sebelius, -- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012 WL 5359630 (E. D. Mich. Oct. 31, 2012) \n(citing FDA, Birth Control Guide (Aug. 2012) (available at \nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/By Audience/For Women/ucm 18465).   Plaintiffs argue that \n                            \n1 Call to Action Pennsylvania, Catholics for Social Justice, Pittsburgh Area Pax Christi and the \nAssociation of Pittsburgh Priests have submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss (Document No. 30), and The American Center for Law & Justice \nand Seventy-Nine (79) Members of the United States Congress have submitted an amicus curiae \nbrief in support of Plaintiffs’ opposition to the motion to dismiss (Document No. 25). \n \n2 The term “group health plans” includes both insured and self-insured group health plans.  76 \nFed.Reg. 46,621, 46,622. \n \n3 Prior to the introduction of the WHA, the ACA did not cover preventive services for women. \n2 \n \n\n \n  requiring them to cover contraceptive services that their faith deems contrary to its religious \ntenets impinges upon their religious freedom. \n  Defendants have moved to dismiss the entire complaint4 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1), arguing that Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe and that Plaintiffs lack standing.  \nPlaintiffs strenuously oppose Defendants’ motion contending that the ACA and its regulations \nare “final” and are causing immediate impact and cognizable injury to Plaintiffs. \n  After careful and deliberate consideration, the Court concludes that, in light of the clear \nand concrete steps that Defendants are taking to address the concerns of Plaintiffs, including \ntheir commitment not to enforce the challenged regulations against Plaintiffs while \naccommodations are under consideration, and in any event no sooner than January 2014, \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for judicial review and that Plaintiffs have not alleged an injury in \nfact under existing law sufficient to establish standing.  Therefore, for the reasons hereinafter \nstated, Defendants’ motion to dismiss will be granted and Plaintiffs’ Complaint will be dismissed \nwithout prejudice in its entirety. \n \n \n                            \n4 In actuality, the Motion to Dismiss directly challenges only three counts of the Complaint, \nCount I - Substantial Burden on Religious Exercise In Violation of the Religion Freedom \nRestoration Act; Count II - Substantial Burden on Religious Exercise In Violation of the Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment; and Count VI - Compelled Speech in Violation of the \nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  As will be discussed infra, Defendants argue that \n“there is a substantial likelihood that all of plaintiffs’ claims will be materially affected, if not \nmade entirely irrelevant, by changes to the regulations, and this Court should dismiss all \nplaintiffs’ claims.”  Reply Br. at 15 (Document No. 40). \n \n3 \n \n\n \n  Background5 \nA.  The Parties \n  Plaintiff Most Reverend David A. Zubik, Bishop of The Roman Catholic Diocese of \nPittsburgh, is the Trustee of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh (the “Diocese”), a \nPennsylvania Charitable Trust.  The Diocese is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, \nand educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \nThe Diocese is comprised of 206 parishes and their charitable trusts and employs over 140 \npeople.  The employees of the Diocese are individuals of all faiths. \n  The Diocese serves the community through its affiliated Catholic schools, which include \napproximately sixty-six (66) elementary schools, eleven (11) high schools, two (2) non-\nresidential schools for individuals with disabilities, and various preschool programs.  The \nDiocesan schools are open to and serve all children, without regard to the students’ religion, race \nor financial condition.  Complaint, ¶ ¶ 26-30. \n  The Diocese also provides numerous social services to the residents of its six-county \ncommunity and assists the work of many other local organizations. \n  The Diocese operates a self-insured plan of health care coverage through the Catholic \nEmployers Benefits Plan Delaware Trust (the “Catholic Employers Benefits Plan”), which \nfunctions as the insurance company underwriting the medical care costs of covered employees, \nwith all funding coming from the Diocese and its covered entities. The Catholic Employers \nBenefits Plan insures employees of the Diocese,  all of the Diocesan parishes and schools, and \nseveral other affiliated entities.   \n                            \n5 The following facts are taken from the Complaint and are not findings of fact by the Court.  \nInstead, the Court will assume the facts in the Complaint to be true for the purpose of the \npending 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. \n4 \n \n\n \n    The Diocesan health care plans are administered by Third Party Administrators, who are \npaid a flat fee for each covered individual for administering the plans but who do not pay for any \nservices received by covered employees.  The next Diocesan health care plan year begins \nJanuary 1, 2013.  The health care plans offered by the Diocese to its employees are all \n“grandfathered”6 under the ACA.   \n  Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc. (“Catholic Charities”) is a \nnon-profit corporation affiliated with the Diocese.  It is organized exclusively for charitable, \nreligious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.  Catholic Charities is the primary social service agency of the Diocese.  The \nmission of Catholic Charities is to serve all regardless of religious affiliation in their time of \ngreatest need.  Catholic Charities employs and serves individuals of all faiths.   \n  Prior to July 1, 2012, Catholic Charities contracted with insurer Highmark Blue Cross \nBlue Shield to offer health care coverage to its employees.  However, commencing on July 1, \n2012, Catholic Charities’ health care plan is covered by the Diocese’s self-insurance, through the \nCatholic Employers Benefit Plan, and is administered by a Third Party Administrator.  Catholic \nCharities’ next health care plan year, under the Catholic Employers Benefit Plan, will begin on \nJanuary 1, 2013.   \n                            \n6 “Grandfathered” health plans are generally exempt from the “preventive health care services” \nrequirement of the ACA.  Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance \nIssuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,731 (July 19, 2010). For a comprehensive summary of the \napplicability of ACA provisions to grandfathered health plans, see Application of the New \nHealth Reform Provisions of Part A of Title XXVII of the PHS Act to Grandfathered Plans, \navailable at www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/grandfatherregtable.pdf.   Grandfathered health plans cannot \nundergo substantial change after March 23, 2010 without losing grandfathered status; however \nthe interim final regulations generally permit plan sponsors and issuers to make voluntary \nchanges to increase benefits, to conform to required legal changes, and to adopt voluntarily other \nconsumer protections in the ACA.  75 Fed. Reg. 34538-01, 34546 (June 17, 2010).   \n5 \n \n\n \n    Plaintiff Catholic Cemeteries maintains perpetual resting places for the deceased in \nsixteen (16) Association-owned cemeteries and provides burial-related services to individuals.  \nWhile cemetery plots can only be owned by Catholics, deceased persons from any religion can \nbe buried in the cemeteries.  Whenever asked,  Catholic Cemeteries also provides free burial \nspace to indigents, as well as free products and services connected with a burial. \n  Additionally, Catholic Cemeteries also serves women and men dealing with issues of \ngrief, anger, guilt, or forgiveness related to an abortion experience. \n  Employment at Catholic Cemeteries is not limited to Catholics and Catholic Cemeteries \ndoes not inquire into its employees’ religious beliefs.  Catholic Cemeteries provides its \nemployees with four (4) health care plan options.  All four health care plans are self-insured by \nthe Catholic Employers Benefits Plan.  The next plan year for Catholic Cemeteries’ health care \nplan begins on January 1, 2013.  Three of Catholic Cemeteries’ health care plan options are \ngrandfathered.  One of Catholic Cemeteries’ health care plan options is not grandfathered, as \nCatholic Cemeteries changed its insurer for that health care plan between March 23, 2010 and \nNovember 15, 2010, in part, to avoid adding contraceptive coverage to that plan.  Complaint, at  \n¶¶ 64 - 79. \n  Defendants are the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Kathleen \nSebelius in her official capacity as Secretary of HHS , the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”), \nHilda L. Solis in her official capacity as Secretary of  DOL, U. S. Department of Treasury, and \nTimothy F. Geithner in his official capacity as Secretary of Treasury.  Collectively, Defendants \nare the departments and officials responsible for adopting, administering, and enforcing the \nregulations to which Plaintiffs object. \n \n6 \n \n\n \n  B.  The Relevant Statutes and Regulations \n  This case is one of forty (40) lawsuits which challenge the ACA’s  preventive services \nregulations regarding their requirements relating to contraception.7  See The  \nBecket Fund for Religious Liberty--HHS Mandate Information Central, \nwww.becketfund.org/hhsinformationcentral (last visited November 26, 2012).   \n  The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, instituted a variety of alleged health care \nreforms.  Most relevant to this lawsuit, the ACA requires group health care plans to provide no-\ncost coverage for “preventive care” and screening for women.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  The \nACA did not, however, specifically define the contours of “preventive care.”  Rather, it \ndelegated that responsibility to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), an \n                            \n7 Opinions have been issued in eight (8) cases:  \n \n  (i) in three cases, the defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted on the issues of standing \nand ripeness, to wit:  State of Nebraska v. Sebelius, -- F.Supp.2d -, 2012 WL 2913401 (D. Neb. \nJuly 17, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-3238 (8th Cir. Sept. 25, 2012); Belmont Abbey College \nv. Sebelius, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2012 WL 2914417 (D.D.C. July 18, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-\n5291  (C.A.D.C. Sept. 20, 2012);  and Wheaton College v. Sebelius, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2012 WL \n3637162 (D.D.C. August 24, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-5273 (C.A.D.C. Aug. 30, 2012);   \n  (ii) in another, the defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted on the merits, O’Brien v. \nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2012 WL 4481208 \n(E.D. Mo., Sept. 28, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-3357 (8th Cir. Oct. 4, 2012);   \n  (iii) in two others, plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction was granted:  Newland v. \nSebelius, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2012 WL 3069154 (D. Colo. July 27, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-\n1380 (10th Cir. Sept. 26, 2012) and Tyndale House Publishers v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp.2d ---, \n2012 WL 5817323 (D.D.C. Nov. 16, 2012); \n  (iv) in one other, the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction was granted as to the \nindividual and the for-profit secular plaintiffs, but the district court found that the non-profit \norganization plaintiff did not have standing:  Legatus v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp.2d ---, 2012 WL \n5359630 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 31, 2012); and \n  (v) in one other, the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction was denied as the court \nfound that corporations did not have protected rights under the Free Exercise Clause and that the \nindividual plaintiffs did not show a likelihood of success on the merits as to either their free \nexercise or RFRA claims.  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, -- F. Supp.2d ---, 2012 WL \n5844972 (W.D. Okla. Nov. 19, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-6294 (10th Cir. Nov. 20, 2012). \n \n7 \n \n\n \n  agency of HHS.  On August 1, 2011, HRSA issued its Required Health Plan Coverage \nGuidelines that defined the scope of women’s preventive services for purposes of the ACA.  The \nHRSA Guidelines include, inter alia, “the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women \nwith reproductive capacity.”  HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services:  Required  Health Plan \nCoverage Guidelines at www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/. \n  However, the preventive care coverage requirement does not apply to grandfathered \nhealth plans and certain religious employers are exempt from any requirement to provide \ncoverage for contraceptive services.  See Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health \nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under The Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (Aug. 3, 2011).  In order to qualify as a “religious \nemployer,” an employer must meet the following criteria: \n  (1)  Has the inculcation of religious values as its purpose. \n  (2)  primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets;  \n  (3)  primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and. \n  (4)  is a non-profit organization under section 6033(a)(1) and section \n6033(a)(3)A)(i) or (iii) of the Code.  Section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii) refer to \nchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches, \nas well as to the exclusively religious activities of any religious order . . . .  \n \n76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (codified at 45 C.F.R. §147.130(A)(1)(IV)(b)). \n \n  On February 10, 2012, the final regulations concerning the religious exemption were \nposted.8  In addition to posting the final regulations, HHS issued a bulletin which established a \ntemporary enforcement “safe-harbor” for group health care plans sponsored by certain non-profit \norganizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that do not qualify for the \n                            \n8 In the final regulations, Defendants adopted without change the definition of “religious \nemployer” as defined in the amended interim final regulations.  77 Fed.Reg. 8725. \n \n8 \n \n\n \n  religious employer exemption.9  The bulletin confirmed that during the temporary enforcement \nsafe harbor period, Defendants will not take any enforcement action against any employer, group \nhealth care plan, or group health care insurance issuer with respect to a non-grandfathered plan \nthat fails to cover some or all of the recommended contraceptive services and that is sponsored \nby an organization that meets the following criteria: \n  1.  The organization is organized and operates as a non-profit entity; \n \n  2.  From February 10, 2012, onward, contraceptive coverage has not been \nprovided at any point by the group health plan established or maintained by the \norganization, consistent with any applicable [s]tate law, because of the religious \nbeliefs of the organization; \n \n  3.  . . .  [T]he group health plan established or maintained by the \norganization (or another entity on behalf of the plan, such as a health insurance \nissuer or third-party administrator) must provide [notice] to participants . . . \nstat[ing] that contraceptive coverage will not be provided under the plan for the \nfirst plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2012. \n \n  4.  The organization self-certifies that it satisfies criteria 1 - 3 above  . . . . \n \nHHS, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor, February 10, 2012.  At the same \ntime, Defendants announced that they “will work with stakeholders to develop alternative ways \nof providing contraceptive coverage without cost sharing with respect to non-exempted, non-\nprofit religious organizations with religious objections to such coverage.”  77 Fed.Reg. 8725, \n8728.    On August 15, 2012, HHS reissued the bulletin originally issued on February 10, 2012,10 \nstating that it was not “changing the February 10 policy, but was clarifying three points: (1)  that \n                            \n9 See http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/0210212/20120210-Preventive-Services-\nBulletin.pdf.    \n \n10 It appears that the August 2012 Guidance was issued in response to the lawsuit filed by \nWheaton College.  In its Complaint, Wheaton College alleged that it was not eligible for the \ntemporary safe harbor.  In their motion to dismiss, Defendants “announced an interpretation of \nthe safe harbor criteria encompasses Wheaton, and this interpretation [was] formalized in the \nAugust 2012 Guidance.”  Wheaton College v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 3637162, *9  n. 4 (D.D.C. \nAug. 24, 2012). \n9 \n \n\n \n  the safe harbor is also available to non-profit organizations with religious objections to some but \nnot all contraceptive coverage . . .; (2) that group health plans that took some action to try to \nexclude or limit contraceptive coverage that was not successful as of February 10, 2012, are not \nfor that reason precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor . . .; and (3) that the safe harbor may \nbe invoked without prejudice by non-profit organizations that are uncertain whether they qualify \nfor religious employer exemption . . . .”  HHS, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe \nHarbor, August 15, 2012 at n.1.  See http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/prev-services-guidance-\n08152012.pdf. \n  The “safe harbor provides an additional year for these group health plans and group \ninsurance issuers (i.e., until the first plan beginning on or about August 1, 2013)” to comply with \nHRSA guidelines regarding contraceptive coverage.  Id. at 3. \n  On March 21, 2012, Defendants published an “advance notice of proposed rulemaking” \n(“ANPRM”), in which they announced the intentions of the Defendants to propose amendments \nthat “would establish alternative ways to fulfill the requirements of [the ACA] when health \ncoverage is sponsored or arranged by a religious organization that objects to the coverage of \ncontraceptive services for religious reasons and that is not exempt under the final regulations \npublished February 15, 2012.”  77 Fed.Reg. 16,501.  The ANPRM notes that one of the goals of \nDefendants is “to protect . . . religious organizations from having to contract, arrange, or pay for \ncontraceptive coverage,” while also maintaining contraceptive coverage without cost sharing for \nindividuals who receive coverage through those organizations.  77 Fed.Reg. 16,501, 16,503.  “In \nshort, the ANPRM is ‘the first step toward promulgating . . . amended final regulations’ prior to \nthe end of the temporary enforcement safe harbor that will ‘accommodat[e] non-exempt, non-\nprofit religious organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive services and \n10 \n \n\n \n  assur[e] that participants and beneficiaries covered under such organizations’ plans receive \ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing.”  Nebraska v. HHS, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2012 WL \n2913402, *5 (D. Neb. July 17, 2012) (quoting 77 Fed.Reg. 16,501, 16,503). \nThe ANPRM also states that following the ninety-day comment period on the ANPRM, \nDefendants will publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which will afford the public \nwith another opportunity for comment before amended final regulations are issued.  77 Fed.Reg. \n16,503.  Public comments were due on or before June 19, 2012, and the Regulations.gov web \nsite reports that approximately 63,171 comments were received by the close of the comment \nperiod.  See http://www.regulations.gov. \nStandard of Review \n  A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) contends that the district court lacks \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  Such a motion questions the court's “very power to hear the case” \nand is considered either “facial,” that is, one which attacks the complaint on its face, or “factual,” \none which attacks subject matter jurisdiction as a matter of fact.  Mortensen v. First. Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977); see also Petruska v. Gannon Univ., 462 F.3d 294, \n302, n. 3 (3d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 550 U.S. 903 (2007). When a motion to dismiss pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(1) is filed prior to the defendant filing an answer to the complaint, it is, by \ndefinition, a facial attack.  Zimmerman v. Wolff, 622 F.Supp.2d 240, 243 (E.D. Pa. 2008); see \nalso Mortensen, 549 F.2d at 891, n. 17 (a “factual jurisdictional proceeding cannot occur until \nplaintiff's allegations have been controverted.”).   Defendants have not filed an answer and the \nparties do not contest that Defendants are challenging jurisdiction on the face of the complaint.  \n  “Facial attacks . . .  contest the sufficiency of the pleadings, and the trial court must \naccept the complaint's allegations as true.” Common Cause v. Pennsylvania, 558 F.3d 249, 257 \n11 \n \n\n \n  (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Taliaferro v. Darby Twp. Zoning Bd., 458 F.3d 181, 188 (3d Cir. 2006)). \nThe court's review is limited to “the allegations on the face of the complaint . . . and any \ndocuments referenced in the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” \nChurch of the Universal Bhd. v. Farmington Twp. Supervisors, 296 Fed. Appx. 285, 288 (3d Cir. \n2008) (citing Mortensen, 549 F.2d at 891, and Turicentro, S.A. v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 303 F.3d \n293, 300 (3d Cir. 2002)). A complaint under facial attack may be properly dismissed “only when \nthe claim ‘clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining \njurisdiction or . . . is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.’ ” Kehr Packages v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 \nF.2d 1406, 1408–09 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946)); see also \nIwanowa v. Ford Motor Co., 67 F. Supp. 2d 424, 438 (D.N.J. 1999) (such a complaint should be \ndismissed “only if it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff will not be able to assert a colorable \nclaim of subject matter jurisdiction.”).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nhas warned district courts against treating a motion under Rule 12(b)(1) identically to one \nbrought under Rule 12(b)(6) which reaches the merits of the claim, noting that “the standard for \nsurviving a Rule 12(b)(1) motion is lower than that for a 12(b)(6) motion.” Gould Elecs. Inc. v. \nUnited States, 220 F.3d 169, 178 (3d Cir. 2000).  The plaintiff has the burden of establishing that \njurisdiction is timely and proper in this Court.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n(1992). \nDiscussion \n  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that “in a case of actual controversy within its \njurisdiction . . . any court of the United States . . . may declare the rights and other legal relations \nof any interested party seeking such a declaration . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). Jurisdiction is \ndependent on the existence of a “case or controversy” as required by Article III of the United \n12 \n \n\n \n  States Constitution.  “ ‘This language restricts the federal judicial power to the traditional role of \nthe Anglo-American courts’ and thereby prevents courts from taking ‘possession of almost every \nsubject proper for legislative discussion and decision.’ ”  New Jersey Physicians, Inc. v. \nPresident of the United States, 653 F.3d 234, 237 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Ariz. Christian Sch. \nTuition Org. v. Winn, -- U.S. --, 131 S. Ct. 1436, 144-42 (2011)).  \n  “ ‘Courts enforce the case-or-controversy requirement through the several justiciability \ndoctrines,’ which ‘include standing, ripeness, mootness, the political-question doctrine, and the \nprohibition on advisory opinions.’ ”  New Jersey Physicians, 653 F.3d at 238 (quoting Toll Bros., \nInc. v Twp. of Readington, 555 F.3d 131, 137 (3d Cir. 2009)). \n  Plaintiffs argue that they “cannot, without violating their sincerely-held religious beliefs, \noffer coverage [for preventive care] or other devices, drugs, procedures, or services that are \ninconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church.”  Complaint at ¶ 162. \n  Defendants argue that at this time no justiciable controversy exists because Plaintiffs are \nnot subject to enforcement on the challenged regulations until at least January 1, 2014, if at all.   \nPresently, Plaintiffs qualify for a number of exemptions.11  For example, the health care plans \noffered by the Diocese and three of the four  plans offered by Catholic Cemeteries are exempt by \nvirtue of the ACA grandfather provisions.  Additionally, all of the health care plans offered by \nPlaintiffs are exempt by virtue of the temporary safe harbor provision until at least January 1, \n                            \n11 This distinguishes the current case from O’Brien v. HHS, 2012 WL 4481208 (E.D. Mo. Sept. \n28, 2012), in which the plaintiff, a secular, for-profit company, did not qualify for any \nexemptions.  Rather, this case is akin to other cases against HHS that have been dismissed for \nlack of Article III standing or ripeness.  See., e.g., Wheaton College v. Sebelius, 2012 WL \n3637162 (D.D.C. Aug. 24, 2012); Belmont Abbey College v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 2914417 \n(D.D.C. July 18, 2012); and Nebraska v. HHS, 2012 WL 2913402 (D. Neb. July 17, 2012). \n \n13 \n \n\n \n  2014.  Accordingly, Defendants argue that the controversy is not ripe and that Plaintiffs do not \nhave standing to sue at this time.12 \n   The Court will examine each of these contentions seriatim. \nA.  Ripeness13  \n  “A claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not \noccur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300, \n(1998). Yet “ripeness is a matter of degree whose threshold is notoriously hard to pinpoint.” \nPittsburgh Mack Sales & Serv. Inc. v. Int’l Union of Operating Eng’rs, Local Union, 580 F.3d \n185, 190 (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  This task is particularly difficult in declaratory \njudgment actions because they are often sought before a completed injury has occurred. Id. \n  In Abbott Lab. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), overruled on other grounds, \nCalifano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977) and Pacific Gas  & Elec. Co. v. State Energy \nResources Conservation & Dev. Comm’n, 461 U.S. 190, 201 (1983), the United States Supreme \nCourt held that ripeness turns on  “the fitness of the issue for judicial decision” and “the hardship \nto the parties of withholding court consideration.”  The United States Court of Appeals for the \n                            \n12 Ripeness, which determines when a party may bring a claim, provides a slightly more narrow \nground for dismissal than standing, which implicates the question of who may bring suit.  See \nJoint Stock Soc’y v. UDV North Am., Inc., 266 F.3d 164, 174 (3d Cir. 2001) (“whereas ripeness \nis concerned with when an action may be brought, standing focuses on who may bring a ripe \naction.”) \n \n13 Plaintiffs, relying on Peachlum v. City of York, Pennsylvania, 333 F.3d 429 (3d Cir. 2003), \nsuggest that this case should be subject to a relaxed ripeness standard because it involves \nfundamental rights.  Pls’ Opp’n at 15-16.  However, even under this relaxed standard, their \nclaims would still not be ripe.  In Peachlum, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals indicated that, in \nsuch cases, “even the remotest threat of prosecution, such as the absence of a promise not to \nprosecute, has supported a holding of ripeness where the issues in the case were ‘predominantly \nlegal’ and did not require additional factual development.”  33 F.3d at 435.  In the case sub \njudice, it is not disputed that Defendants have provided a promise not to enforce, and further \nfactual development is required to know whether, when, and how the challenged regulations will, \nin fact, apply to Plaintiffs. \n14 \n \n\n \n  Third Circuit has refined the ripeness test to evaluate whether an action for declaratory judgment \nis ripe.   Pic-A-State Pa, Inc. v. Reno, 76 F.3d 1294, 1298  (3d Cir. 1996).  Our appellate court \nhas instructed: \nIn determining whether to engage in pre-enforcement review of a statute in a \ndeclaratory judgment action, we look, among other factors, to (1) the adversity of \nthe parties’ interests, (2) the conclusiveness of the judgment, and (3) the utility of \nthe judgment. \n \nId. (citing Freehold Cogeneration Assocs. v. Bd. Reg. Comm’rs, 44 F.3d 1178, 1188 (3d Cir.), \ncert. denied, 516  U.S. 815 (1995)); Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, 912 F.2d \n643, 647 (3d Cir. 1990). \n    1.  Adversity of Interest \n  “[A] potential harm that is ‘contingent’ on a future event occurring will likely not satisfy \nthis prong of the ripeness test.”  Pittsburgh Mack Sales & Serv., 580 F.3d  at 190 (citing Step \nSaver, 912 F.2d at 647-48).  The party seeking review need not have suffered a “completed” \nharm, but there must be a substantial threat of real harm that remains throughout the litigation. \nPresbytery of New Jersey of Orthodox Presbyterian Church v. Florio, 40 F.3d 1454, 1463 (3d \nCir. 1994). For instance, a declaratory judgment action is ripe if “a regulation requires immediate \nand significant change in the plaintiffs' conduct of their affairs.” Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 153.  \nIf, however, intervening events would remove the potential for harm, the controversy becomes \nspeculative. Presbytery, 40 F.3d at 1463. \n  Defendants argue that they have “initiated a rulemaking to amend the preventive \ncoverage regulations to accommodate further the concerns expressed by plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated organizations and have made clear that the amendments will be finalized well before the \nearliest date on which the challenged regulations could be enforced by defendants against \n15 \n \n\n \n  plaintiffs.”  Br. at 16.  Plaintiffs respond that their claims are ripe because “they are challenging \nthe current law, which is in effect and published in the C.F.R.”  Pl’s Response at 17. \n  There is no doubt that the regulations challenged by Plaintiffs are  “clearly definitive” by \nvirtue of having been formally promulgated.  See Abbott Laboratories,  387 U.S. at 152-53 \n(finding that pre-enforcement challenge to regulations was fit for judicial determination because \nthe challenged regulation was “quite clearly definitive;” there was “no hint that [the] regulation \n[was] informal, or only the ruling of a subordinate official, or tentative;” and the regulation “was \nmade effective upon publication.”  387 U.S. at 151. But see Belmont Abbey, 2012 WL 2914417 \nat *12 (holding that “the challenged rule is not “sufficiently final” to satisfy the fitness prong of \nthe ripeness inquiry.”); Wheaton, 2012 WL 3637162, at *8 (holding that because the preventive \nservices regulations are in the process of being amended, they are “by definition a tentative \nagency position . . . .”). \n  However, an important distinction exists between this case and Abbott Laboratories.  The \nSupreme Court found that the parties in Abbott Laboratories had a clear expectation that \ncompliance with the regulations was expected.  387 U.S. at 152.   In the instant case, Defendants \nhave repeatedly stated that they intend to amend the regulations to address the concerns raised by \nreligious organizations with religious objections to providing preventive services coverage.  In \nfact, Defendants “have published their plan to amend the rule to address the exact concerns \nPlaintiff[s] raise[] in this action and have stated clearly and repeatedly in the Federal Register \nthat they intend to finalize the changes before the enforcement safe harbor ends.”  Belmont \nAbbey, 2012 WL 2914417 at * 9.  In addition, “Defendants have already initiated the amendment \nprocess by issuing an ANPRM.”  Id.  As the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia has observed, “[i]f the [agency’s] position is likely to be abandoned or modified \n16 \n \n\n \n  before it is actually put into effect, then its review wastes the court’s time and interferes with the \nprocess by which the agency is attempting to reach a final decision.”  Continental Airlines, Inc. \nv. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 552 F.2d 107, 125 (D.C. Cir. 1975). \n  In this case, the safe harbor provisions of the regulation itself protects all of the Plaintiffs \nfrom any potential enforcement action until at least January 1, 2014.  Further, the health care \nplan offered by the Diocese, as well as three of the four health care plans offered by Catholic \nCemeteries, share additional protection under the regulations insofar as they are each \ngrandfathered under the ACA.14   Also it cannot be overlooked that through the ANPRM, \nDefendants have committed to amending the preventive services coverage regulations well \nbefore January 2014 to accommodate the religious objections of organizations such as Plaintiffs. \nAs the Belmont Abbey court explained: \n[Defendants] have published their plan to amend the rule to address the exact \nconcerns Plaintiff raises in this action and have stated clearly and repeatedly in \nthe Federal Register that they intend to finalize the changes before the \nenforcement safe harbor ends.  Not only that, but Defendants have already \ninitiated the amendment process by issuing an ANPRM. The government, \nmoreover, has done nothing to suggest that it might abandon its efforts to modify \nthe rule -- indeed, it has steadily pursued that course -- and it is entitled to a \npresumption that it acts in good faith. \n \n2012 WL 2914417, at *9 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).  See also Sossamon v. \nLone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 2009) (“Without evidence to the contrary, \nwe assume that formally announced changes to official governmental policy are not more \n                            \n14 Plaintiffs argue that in light of increasing costs and a fluctuating regulatory environment, it is \nanticipated that they will lose their grandfather exemption from the ACA requirements in the \nforeseeable future.  However, Plaintiffs do not allege that they intend to make - or are even \ncontemplating - specific changes to their plans that would end their grandfathered status.  \nInstead, Plaintiffs merely speculate and/or assume that they will lose grandfathered status \nsometime in the future. \n17 \n \n\n \n  litigation posturing.”); Comcast Corp. v. F.C.C., 526 F.3d 763, 762 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (“We \nmust presume an agency acts in good faith . . .); Legatus, 2012 WL 5359630 at *5 (same). \n  Once the forthcoming amendments are finalized, if Plaintiffs’ concerns are not resolved \nto their satisfaction, they “will have ample opportunity [ ] to bring [their] legal challenge at a \ntime when harm is more imminent and more certain.”  Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 \nU.S. 726, 734 (1998).  As Defendants acknowledge, “if plaintiffs still believe their rights have \nbeen violated once the amended regulations are issued, they can file suit challenging them at that \ntime and will have lost nothing in the interim.”  Reply Br. at 1. \n  As a result, the Court finds that this action fails to present sufficient adversity of interest \nbetween the parties. \n  2.  Conclusiveness \n  A declaratory judgment is conclusive if it definitively decides the rights of the parties. \nStep Saver, 912 F.2d at 649, n. 9.  If a declaratory judgment is based on a contingency, however, \nit fails to change the parties' legal status, and becomes an exercise in futility.  Id. at 649.  In this \nlawsuit, even if Plaintiffs received the declaratory judgment they seek at this time, it would not \naffect their rights unless Defendants sought or threatened to bring an enforcement action against \nthem.  Since this has not occurred, and cannot occur under current law before January 2014, the \nissuance of a declaratory judgment would be futile.   \n  3.  Utility \n  The purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to provide useful judgments that clarify \nlegal relationships so that parties can “make responsible decisions about the future.” Step–Saver, \n912 F.2d at 649.  A judgment has utility if it affects the parties' plans of action.  Id.  There is no \ndoubt that a declaratory judgment would be useful to Plaintiffs and affect their plans of action.  \n18 \n \n\n \n  However, the mere fact that a declaratory judgment would be useful to assist Plaintiffs in making \ntheir upcoming operational decisions is insufficient to overcome the fact that no actual \ncontroversy yet exists between the parties.  Therefore, the Court finds that a declaratory \njudgment would be of remarkably little utility at this stage.  See Armstrong World Indus. v. \nAdams, 961 F.2d 405, 423, 24 (3d Cir. 1992); Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 649-50.   \n  After careful and deliberate consideration of each of these factors, the Court finds that \nbecause Plaintiffs’ claims fail to fit these requirements, their case is not ripe and the Court must \ndismiss it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.15 \n \nB.  Standing \n  In addition to arguing that the present case is not ripe for decision at this time, \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing as they have failed to demonstrate an \ninjury that is not speculative.  As discussed supra, the Court has found that none of the Plaintiffs \nhave established that their claims are ripe and, thus, no case or controversy exists and the \nremaining issues raised by Defendants in their motion to dismiss are moot.  Nevertheless, it \nmerits mention that assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs were able to establish that their claims \nwere ripe, they are not able to establish standing to  sue at this time.16   \n                            \n15 If the Court were to apply the Abbott Laboratories framework, the finding that Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are not ripe would not change.  Given Defendants’ ongoing administrative process, its \npublic commitment to regulatory change, and the enforcement safe harbor, the Court finds that \nthe issues presented in this case are unfit for judicial review and Plaintiffs will suffer no hardship \nfrom the Court’s withholding of consideration at this time. \n \n16 Although the Court need not address this argument as it has already decided that Plaintiffs \nhave not satisfied the standard legal ripeness requirements, it will do so as standing implicates \nmany of the same concerns underlying the Court’s ripeness analysis. \n19 \n \n\n \n    Standing “is a threshold jurisdictional requirement, derived from the ‘case or \ncontroversy’ language of Article III of the Constitution.” Public Interest Research Grp. of N.J., \nInc. v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 117 (3d Cir. 1997).  The United States Supreme \nCourt has “always insisted on strict compliance with this jurisdictional standing requirement.” \nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819 (1997).   \n  Defendants attack Plaintiffs’ standing to bring this suit because, according to Defendants, \nno harm is imminent as the safe harbor provision delays any potential enforcement action until at \nleast January 2014 and because the ANPRM is in effect to change the objectionable regulations.  \n  In Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990), the Supreme Court stated:  “[W]e \nhave said many times before and reiterate today:  Allegations of possible future injury do not \nsatisfy the requirements of Art[icle] III.  A threatened injury must be certainly impending to \nconstitute an injury in fact.”  \n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has summarized the \nconstitutional standing requirements as follows: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in \nfact - an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and \n(b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there must be a causal connection \nbetween the injury and the conduct complained of - the injury has to be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third \nparty not before the court; and (3) it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the \ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Ballentine v. U.S., 486 F.3d 806, 814 (3d Cir. \n2007).  “In other words, the plaintiff must show that he or she personally has suffered some \nactual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant and the \n20 \n \n\n \n  injury must be concrete and capable of being redressed by the court should the plaintiff prevail \non the merits.” Taliaferro v. Darby Twp. Zoning Bd., 458 F.3d 181, 188-89 (3d Cir. 2006).  \n  In the present circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently \nallege an injury in fact to satisfy their burden to establish standing.  First, the preventive care \nregulations do not apply to “grandfathered” health care plans and the majority of health care \nplans at issue in this litigation are “grandfathered.”  Second, for the one plan that is not \ngrandfathered and even assuming arguendo that the other plans lost their grandfather status, the \nsafe-harbor provisions render the threatened harm from the preventive care regulations too \nremote to constitute “imminent” injury.  Finally, the Court must agree with Defendants that any \ninjury from enforcement of the preventative care regulations after the safe harbor expires is \npurely speculative, as Defendants have formally declared their intention to amend the \npreventative care regulations before that time in order to accommodate the concerns of religious \norganizations about funding or facilitating access to preventive care services through their health \ncare insurance coverage plans.   \n  As Defendants point out, at this time, the challenged regulations cannot be enforced due \nto the safe harbor provisions and there is no authentic threat of imminent enforcement.  To \ndemonstrate an injury in fact, sufficient to maintain standing in this case, Plaintiffs must have \nsuffered “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, . . . \nand (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (quotations \nand citations omitted). \n21 \n \n\n \n    At first blush, some factors alleged by Plaintiffs appear to suggest that Plaintiffs are \npresently suffering an injury.17  For example, Plaintiffs allege that they need lead time to plan for \ntheir employee health care plans,18 and that they are unable to enter into collective bargaining \nagreement negotiations in January 2013, set tuition rates in February 2013, and make teacher \nretention decisions in April 2013, all because of  the uncertainty regarding whether the \nregulations will be amended.   (Complaint ¶ 149).  However, to demonstrate an injury in fact, \nsufficient to maintain standing, Plaintiffs must have suffered an actual or imminent injury, not a \nconjectural or hypothetical  injury.   “Mere economic uncertainty affecting the plaintiff's \nplanning is not sufficient to support premature review.”  Wilmac Corp. v. Bowen, 811 F.2d 809, \n813 (3d Cir. 1987).  See also Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 736 F.2d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. \n1984) (plaintiff's “planning insecurity” insufficient to establish hardship); Bethlehem Steel Corp. \nv. EPA, 536 F.2d 156, 162 (7th Cir. 1976) (“[C]laims of uncertainty in [plaintiff's] business and \ncapital planning are not sufficient to warrant [ ] review of an ongoing administrative process.”); \nBelmont Abbey, 2012 WL 2914417, at * 14 (“Costs stemming from Plaintiff's desire to prepare \nfor contingencies are not sufficient, however, to constitute a hardship for purposes of the ripeness \ninquiry—particularly when the agency's promises and actions suggest the situation Plaintiff fears \nmay not occur”).  At the present time, the challenged regulations require nothing of Plaintiffs. \n                            \n17 The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ arguments that they are presently harmed because the third-\nparty administrator of the employee health care plan has requested that they sign an \nindemnification agreement to be without merit as such argument depends entirely on the \nassumption that liability will be imposed for Plaintiffs’ employee health care plan’s failure to \nprovide the prescribed services. \n \n18 Defendants respond that because Plaintiffs’ plan year begins on January 1, 2014, the \nregulations will have been amended, at the latest, several months before Plaintiffs will be subject \nto enforcement. “And even if plaintiffs’ worst fears were to somehow come to pass, plaintiffs \ncould then seek preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo while the Court considers \nthe merits of their claims.”  Reply Br. at 10. \n22 \n \n\n \n      For example, Plaintiffs are required to demonstrate that there is some genuine threat of \nenforcement, which would raise the potential injury in this case beyond the speculative level.  \nSee Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564, n. 2 (requiring any alleged future injury to be “certainly \nimpending”).  Paragraphs 151 and 152 of the Complaint exemplify the speculative nature of \nPlaintiffs’ alleged injuries in this case: \n151.  The U.S. Government Mandate, however, may require Plaintiffs to make \nsignificant, and likely revolutionary changes, to their employee coverage.  \nPlaintiffs, moreover, may need to restructure their programs or health plans to fit \nwithin the U.S. Government Mandate’s requirements.  Such changes will require \nsubstantially more lead time. \n \n152.  Even assuming Plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of the safe harbor, \nPlaintiffs must be prepared to implement modified health coverage, whatever \nthat may end up being, for their employee health plans by January 1, 2014. \n \nComplaint at ¶¶ 151, 152 (emphasis added). \n \n  However, it is not disputed that Defendants have represented that they will not seek any \nenforcement, if at all, against Plaintiffs before January 2014, which further demonstrates the \nspeculative nature of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. The attenuated nature of the threat of \nenforcement as pled in the Complaint confirms Defendants’ argument that any harm in this case \nis purely speculative at this time.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564. \n  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ allegations of injury rest entirely on Plaintiffs’ speculation that \nthe contested regulations in their current form will apply to Plaintiffs in January 2014.  However, \nDefendants have actively begun the process of amending the regulations to address the specific  \nreligious objections which Plaintiffs raise in this litigation. \n  For all these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to establish the requisite \ninjury in fact and, thus, have failed to demonstrate standing. \n   \n23 \n \n\n \n  C.  Religious Employer Exemption and APA Claims \n  1.  Religious Employer Exemption \n  Plaintiffs argue that even if the motion to dismiss is granted, their challenge to the \nreligious employer exemption and their  APA claims should survive.  In support of their position, \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants’ “consistent public position, outside of litigation, is that the \nnarrow religious employer exemption is final, but that it will provide some alleged \naccommodation for non-exempt religious organizations.”  Sur-Reply at 1.  Defendants respond \nthat “it is pure speculation to suggest that the amended regulations will not address this concern \nas well” as Defendants “have not foreclosed the possibility that the amendment process will alter \nthe religious employer exemption.”  Reply at 15. \n  The ANPRM specifically states that Defendants are seeking to protect religious \norganizations that object to the coverage of contraceptive services for religious reasons and that \nare not exempt under the final regulations published February 15, 2012.   By the plain language \nof the ANPRM, it therefore appears doubtful that the “religious employer” definition will be \namended.19  However, with that said, the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing at this time to \nchallenge the “religious employer” exemption as they have suffered no present injury because \ntheir health care plans are “grandfathered” and they are protected against any enforcement action \nby the safe harbor provision of the regulations. \n  2.  APA Claims \n  Section 704 of the APA provides that a “final agency action for which there is no other \nadequate remedy in a court [is] subject to judicial review.” 5 U.S.C. § 704.  The statutory \n                            \n19 Moreover, in a similar case pending in the United States Court for the Middle District of \nTennessee, the Government attorney stated that it was his “understanding from the agencies that \nthe religious employer exemption is not actively undergoing the amendment process.”  Diocese \nof Nashville v. Sebelius, No. 3:12-cv-934, Transcript. \n24 \n \n\n \n  language of the APA does not explicitly define what qualifies as “final” agency action.  Hindes \nv. FDIC, 137 F.3d 148, 162 (3d Cir. 1998). “The core question is whether the agency has \ncompleted its decisionmaking process, and whether the result of that process is one that will \ndirectly affect the parties.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992); see also \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (noting that for agency action to be final: (1) it \nmust mark the consummation of the decisionmaking process; and (2) rights must be determined \nor legal consequences must flow from action).  Agency action is generally not considered ripe \nfor review “until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions, \nand its factual components fleshed out, by some concrete action . . . that harms or threatens to \nharm [the plaintiff].” Nat'l Park Hospitality Ass'n, 538 U.S. at 808 (quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. 871, \n891 (1990)). \n  Courts have been pragmatic when interpreting the finality element of ripeness under the \nAPA.  See Standard Oil, 449 U.S. at 239;  see also CEC Energy Co., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n \nof the V.I., 891 F.2d 1107, 1110 (3d Cir. 1989); Hindes, 137 F.3d at 162 (noting that finality of \nagency action is determined by its consequences or practical effects).  Additionally, the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit has listed numerous factors that must be considered in assessing \nfinality, which overlap significantly with the aforementioned factors for ripeness. See CEC \nEnergy Co., 891 F.2d at 1110.  The finality factors include: \n(1) whether the decision represents the agency's definitive position on the \nquestion; (2) whether the decision has the status of law with the expectation of \nimmediate compliance; (3) whether the decision has immediate impact on the \nday-to-day operations of the party seeking review; (4) whether the decision  \ninvolves a pure question of law that does not require further factual development;  \nand (5) whether immediate judicial review would speed enforcement of the \nrelevant act. \n \nSolar Turbines Inc., 879 F.2d at 1080 (citing Standard Oil, 449 U.S. at 239-40).   \n25 \n \n\n \n    The Court finds that each of these factors weighs against a determination that Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are ripe.   First, while the regulations are “final,” by virtue of having been formally \npromulgated, the regulations do not represent the Defendants’ “definitive position on the \nquestion” as Defendants  have initiated a formal amendment process of these regulations.  \nSecond,  as discussed at length supra, at the current time there is no expectation of immediate \ncompliance by either Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Third, any decision the Court would make today \nwould not have an immediate impact on Plaintiffs’ day-to-day operations as the existing \nregulations are currently under review and are expected to be modified.  Next, any decision \nclearly requires further factual development as the current controversy at this time is based on \ncontingent facts.  Finally, immediate judicial review would not speed enforcement as Plaintiffs \nare not subject to any potential enforcement action before January 2014, if at all. \n  For these reasons, the Court finds that the finality element of ripeness under the APA is \nnot present at this time. \n \nConclusion \n  For all the foregoing reasons, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants will be granted \nand the Plaintiffs’ Complaint will be dismissed in its entirety without prejudice.   \n  An appropriate Order follows. \n \n              McVerry, J. \n26 \n \n\n \n  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \nMOST REVEREND DAVID A ZUBIK,    ) \nBISHOP OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC     ) \nDIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, as Trustee of   ) \nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a  ) \nCharitable Trust; The ROMAN CATHOLIC   ) \nDIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH; CATHOLIC   ) \nCHARITIES OF THE DIOCESE OF    ) \nPITTSBURGH, INC., an affiliate nonprofit    ) \ncorporation of The Roman Catholic Diocese of  ) \nPittsburgh; and THE CATHOLIC     ) \nCEMETERIES ASSOCIATION OF THE     ) \nDIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, an affiliate     ) \nnonprofit corporation of The Roman Catholic  ) \nDiocese of Pittsburgh,    ) \n                              Plaintiffs,          ) \n  v.            )  12-cv-00676 \n            )  \nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS, in her official    )  \ncapacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of  ) \nHealth and Human Services; HILDA SOLIS, in  ) \nher official capacity as Secretary of the U.S.   ) \nDepartment of Labor; TIMOTHY GEITHNER,  ) \nin his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S.  ) \nDepartment of Treasury; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF  ) \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES;     ) \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR; and    ) \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY,    ) \n      Defendants.      ) \nORDER OF COURT \n  AND NOW, this 27th day of November, 2012, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED \nAND DECREED that the Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED and all counts of Plaintiff’s \nComplaint are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). \n  The Clerk of Court shall docket this case closed. \n \n              BY THE COURT: \n              s/ Terrence F.

This case is about an unprecedented government infringement on the religious \nliberties of religious organizations.  This country was founded by those searching for religious \n \n\n \nliberty and freedom from religious persecution.  And since the founding of this country, religious \norganizations such as Plaintiffs have been free to fulfill their religious beliefs through service to \nall, including the underprivileged and underserved, without regard to the beneficiaries’ religious \nviews and have played a vital role in securing and protecting the civil liberties of all citizens.  \nPlaintiffs alone serve tens of thousands of people annually that the Government does not or \ncannot serve and who without Plaintiffs’ assistance would be without shelter, food, prenatal \nsupport and care, medical care, and vital educational services. \n2.  The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes protect religious organizations from \ngovernmental interference with their religious views—particularly minority religious views.  The \nfounders recognized, through their own experiences, that the mixture of government and religion \nis destructive to both institutions and divisive to the social fabric upon which the county depends.  \nThe Constitution and federal law thus stand as bulwarks against oppressive government actions \neven if supported by a majority of citizens.  This “wall of separation between church and state” is \ncritical to the preservation of religious freedom.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[t]he \nstructure of our government has, for the preservation of civil liberty, rescued the temporal \ninstitutions from religious interference.  On the other hand, it has secured religious liberty from \nthe invasion of civil authority.”   \n3.  The Government is now attacking Plaintiffs’ religious liberties.  Current federal \nlaw described below (the “U.S. Government Mandate”) requires religious organizations such as \nPlaintiffs to provide services that violate their long-standing teachings on abortion and the \nsanctity of human life by subsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating coverage for abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services.  The Government has not \n  2 \n\n \nshown any compelling need to force religious organizations to provide these services, and in fact, \nhas chosen to make exemptions to the law both for religious and non-religious reasons.   \n4.  Despite repeated requests from Church leaders, the Government has insisted that \nit will not change the core principle of the U.S. Government Mandate — that Plaintiffs must \nsubsidize and/or facilitate the provision of certain drugs and services to their employees, which is \ncontrary to Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs.   \n5.  Such an oppression of religious freedom violates Plaintiffs’ clearly established \nfederal constitutional and statutory rights and duties.  The First Amendment also prohibits the \nGovernment from becoming excessively entangled in religious affairs and from interfering with \na religious institution’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, \nministers, or doctrine.  The U.S. Government Mandate tramples all of these rights.   \n6.  An actual, justiciable controversy currently exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants.  Absent a declaration resolving this controversy and the validity of the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate and religious employer exemption, Plaintiffs are uncertain as to their \nrights and duties in planning, negotiating, and/or implementing their group health insurance \nplans, their hiring and retention programs, and their social, educational, and charitable programs \nand ministries, as described below. \n7.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an order vacating the U.S. Government Mandate and \ndeclaring that the U.S. Government Mandate cannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiffs.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against enforcement of the U.S. Government \nMandate. \n  3 \n\n \nI.  PRELIMINARY MATTERS  \n8.  Plaintiff Most Reverend David A. Zubik, Bishop of The Roman Catholic Diocese \nof Pittsburgh, is the Trustee of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a Pennsylvania \nCharitable Trust.  Bishop Zubik resides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \n9.  Plaintiff The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh (the “Diocese”) is a \nPennsylvania Charitable Trust with a principal place of administration in Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania.  It is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, and educational purposes \nwithin the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.    \n10.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc. (“Catholic \nCharities”) is a nonprofit corporation affiliated with the Diocese and with a principal place of \nadministration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  It is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, \nand educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.    \n11.  Plaintiff The Catholic Cemeteries Association of the Diocese of Pittsburgh \n(“Catholic Cemeteries”) is a nonprofit corporation affiliated with the Diocese and with a \nprincipal place of administration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  It is organized exclusively for \ncharitable, religious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the \nInternal Revenue Code.    \n12.  Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services.  She is sued in her official capacity.   \n13.  Defendant Hilda Solis is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.  She is \nsued in her official capacity.   \n14.  Defendant Timothy Geithner is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury.  \nHe is sued in his official capacity.     \n  4 \n\n \n15.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) is an \nexecutive agency of the United States within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct (“RFRA”) and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).   \n16.  Defendant U.S. Department of Labor is an executive agency of the United States \nwithin the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n17.  Defendant U.S. Department of Treasury is an executive agency of the \nUnited States within the meaning of RFRA and the APA.   \n18.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c). \n19.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343(a)(4), and 1346(a)(2). \n20.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nA.  Background on the Bishop and the Diocese \n21.  The Bishop in his capacity as Bishop of the Diocese also serves as Trustee for 206 \nparishes and their charitable trusts.  The Diocese was established in 1843.  The Diocese provides \nservice throughout six counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania—Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, \nGreene, Lawrence, and Washington Counties—including a Catholic population of approximately \n700,000 people.  \n22.  The Bishop also oversees the multifaceted mission of spiritual, educational, and \nsocial service to residents of this six-county region, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.   \n23.  The Diocese employs over 140 people, the majority of whom are full-time.   \n24.  The Diocese employs individuals of all faiths. \n25.  The Diocese does not know whether the majority of its employees share its \n“religious tenets.”  In order to determine those statistics, the Diocese would be required to ask \n  5 \n\n \nthe religious beliefs of all individuals that it employs.  That inquiry, however, would \nsubstantially burden the Diocese’s religious exercise. \n26.  The Diocese serves the community through its affiliated Catholic schools.  The \nDiocese’s Catholic schools include approximately 66 elementary schools, 11 high schools, two \nnon-residential schools for individuals with disabilities, and various preschool programs.  These \nschools educate approximately 22,000 students and provide inner-city children with an \nalternative to failing public education.  Only three school districts in the entire Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania educate more children than the Diocese.   \n27.  The Diocesan schools are open to and serve all children, without regard to the \nstudents’ religion, race, or financial condition.   \n28.  The elementary schools within the Diocese are not exclusive to Catholics and \neducate many minority students.  For example, Good Shepherd School, Northside Catholic \nSchool, and St. Bartholomew School educate many non-Catholic and minority students.  \nAdditionally, Sister Thea Bowman Catholic Academy and St. Benedict the Moor School educate \npredominantly non-Catholic students.     \n29.  Eight Catholic high schools are affiliated with the Diocese, including Bishop \nCanevin High School, Central Catholic High School, North Catholic High School, Oakland \nCatholic High School, Quigley Catholic High School, Saint Joseph High School, Serra Catholic \nHigh School, and Seton-La Salle Catholic High School.  Ninety-nine percent of senior high \nschool students in the Diocesan schools graduate and 97% continue further education after high \nschool. \n30.  The fact that Diocesan schools are open to all students in the greater Pittsburgh \ncommunity is especially important since many of the Diocesan schools are located in districts \n  6 \n\n \nwhere the public schools are “failing.”  Indeed, Governor Tom Corbett has recognized that, \n“[w]here we have failing schools, we have failing students.”  If the Diocesan schools were forced \nto limit their admission to Catholic students, non-Catholic children residing within these failing \nschools districts would most likely be driven into these failing public schools.  \n31.  The Diocese also provides numerous other social services to the residents of its \nsix-county community.  These services are provided without regard to national origin, race, \ncolor, sex, religion, age, or disability.  For example, the Diocese provides crisis pregnancy \nassistance and post-abortion healing ministries.   \n32.  The Diocese assists the work of many other local organizations, including \norganizations that provide support to the homeless, provide scholarships to disadvantaged \nchildren of all faiths, and provide counseling and support to struggling families.   \n33.  The Diocese does not know whether a majority of the people served share its \n“religious tenets.”  In order to determine those statistics, the Diocese would be required to ask \nthe religious beliefs of all individuals that it serves.  That inquiry, however, would substantially \nburden the Diocese’s religious exercise.  \n34.  The Diocese operates a self-insured health plan through the Catholic Employers \nBenefits Plan Delaware Trust (the “Catholic Employers Benefits Plan”).  That is, the Diocese \ndoes not contract with a separate insurance company that pays for the Diocesan employee health \nplans.  Instead, the Trust functions as the insurance company underwriting the covered \nemployees’ medical costs, with all funding coming from the Diocese and its covered affiliates.  \n35.  The Catholic Employers Benefits Plan insures employees of the Diocese of \nPittsburgh, Catholic Cemeteries, all of the Diocesan parishes and schools, and several other \naffiliated entities.  \n  7 \n\n \n36.  Approximately 3,000 employees at the Diocese and its various affiliated entities \nare eligible for coverage under the Catholic Employers Benefits Plan.  Approximately 2,200 \nemployees are covered and approximately 3,500 individuals are covered, including dependents. \n37.  The Diocesan health plans are administered by Third Party Administrators, who \nare paid a flat fee for each covered individual for administering the plans but who do not pay for \nany services received by covered employees.   \n38.  The next Diocesan plan year begins on January 1, 2013.   \n39.  The health plans that the Diocese offers its employees are all “grandfathered.”  \nThe Diocese has included a statement describing its grandfathered status in plan materials, as \nrequired by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii).  While the Diocese’s health plans are \n“grandfathered,” the Diocese, as explained below, is presently injured by the U.S. Government \nMandate.   \n40.  Starting July 1, 2012, the Diocese will also start to insure its affiliated \ncorporation, Catholic Charities, under the Catholic Employers Benefits Plan.    \nB.  Background on Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc. \n41.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities is the primary social service agency of the Diocese \nunder the leadership of Bishop Zubik.   \n42.  The mission of Catholic Charities is to serve all regardless of religious affiliation \nin their time of greatest need.   \n43.  Catholic Charities serves approximately 81,000 people, with approximately 130 \nemployees, and with offices in all six counties that the Diocese serves.   \n44.  Catholic Charities employs individuals of all faiths. \n45.  Catholic Charities serves the needy, underserved, and underprivileged in \ncountless ways.  Its programs and services include adoption, counseling, safety net and stability \n  8 \n\n \nservices, health care for the uninsured, housing and homeless assistance, pregnancy and \nparenting support, and refugee and senior services.  Catholic Charities also maintains crisis \npregnancy assistance and post-abortion healing ministries.  \n46.  Each of the county offices of Catholic Charities provides counseling and other \nsupport services to pregnant women and new mothers.  \n47.  Catholic Charities is able to serve the Southwestern Pennsylvania community \nthrough its “Ambassadors of Hope,” the hundreds of men, women, and teens who volunteer their \ntime in support of the various social service programs run by Catholic Charities and thus answer \nthe call of their faith to serve all in need, regardless of religious affiliation.   \n48.  Through its various social service programs, in 2011, Catholic Charities provided \napproximately 70,966 meals to the hungry, 14,222 hours of case management to struggling \nindividuals and families, and 6,882 hours of counseling.  \n49.  Catholic Charities supports additional programs, including:  the Catholic Charities \nFree Health Care Center, the Roselia Center, Neighborhood-Based Services, St. Joseph House of \nHospitality, Team HOPE, and two centers for seniors.   \n50.  Catholic Charities, through its wholly-owned subsidiary the Catholic Charities \nFree Health Care Center, provides quality medical and dental care at no cost to the working poor.  \nThe Free Health Care Center is the only free health care facility of its kind in the Pittsburgh \nregion that serves low or moderate income individuals who do not have employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance, cannot afford private insurance, or who do not qualify for Medicaid or other \ntypes of assistance.   \n51.  The Catholic Charities Free Health Care Center is critical to that underserved \npopulation who typically delay doctor visits, thereby magnifying health problems, overburdening \n  9 \n\n \nemergency rooms, and disrupting their employers’ work flow.  This segment of the population is \nnot being served by the Government.  The free health services provided at the Catholic Charities \nFree Health Care Center in 2011 are valued at approximately $1,542,230.   \n52.  The Catholic Charities Free Health Care Center has been appropriately named \n“The Miracle on Ninth Street” by patients, volunteers, and staff.  Since opening in 2007, the \nCatholic Charities Free Health Care Center has provided free, quality preventive and primary \ncare to nearly 8,200 individuals during more than 23,000 patient visits.  The Free Health Care \nCenter treats clients without discrimination as to their race, religion, sex, national origin, age, or \nany disability.   \n53.  Catholic Charities also supports the Roselia Center, which is a residential center \nfor women who are homeless, single, pregnant, and parenting, as well as their infants.  At the \nRoselia Center, women who are pregnant or have recently given birth are provided with safe, \ntransitional housing as staff focus on teaching new mothers the skills necessary to obtain \nemployment, live independently, and parent their children.  The staff at the Roselia Center \nprovide counseling services to pregnant women and new mothers.  In 2011, 100% of the mothers \nwho transitioned from Roselia Center to begin a life on their own were able to secure appropriate \nindependent housing.   \n54.  Catholic Charities supports Team HOPE (help on the path to empowerment), \nwhich provides individualized service plans to help the needy gain independence.  A service plan \nincludes programs focusing on workforce development, a “Life Skills University,” and parenting \nsupport, in addition to other services. \n55.  Catholic Charities supports Neighborhood-Based Services (NBS), which helps \nindividuals achieve and maintain independence through its Team HOPE program and which has \n  10 \n\n \nthe mission of providing hope for vulnerable individuals in Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods.  Many \nof the individuals served by NBS are living with disabilities.  NBS joins other Catholic Charities’ \noffices in providing pregnancy and parenting services to more than 1,500 young women every \nyear. \n56.  Catholic Charities supports St. Joseph House of Hospitality, a residential and \ntransitional housing facility located in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, which provides rooms, meals, \nand supportive services to men over 50 who are homeless or at risk for homelessness.  \n57.  Catholic Charities also supports two centers for seniors.  One of those centers is \nChallenges: Options in Aging, a facility located in Lawrence County that provides recreational, \nsocial, and educational services, as well as in-home services, to the aging.  This facility served \nover 25,000 individuals in the past calendar year. \n58.  Donors are the life blood of Catholic Charities and make the mission of Catholic \nCharities, its programs, and its Free Health Care Center possible.  Additionally, the Diocese \nprovides funding to Catholic Charities, its programs, and the Free Health Care Center.  \n59.  Currently, approximately 95 of Catholic Charities’ approximately 136 employees \nparticipate in its group health plan, which is not self-insured. \n60.  Catholic Charities currently contracts with insurer Highmark Blue Cross Blue \nShield to offer health coverage to its employees.    \n61.  Catholic Charities’ current health plans are not “grandfathered.”  Indeed, Catholic \nCharities did not include a statement describing its grandfathered status in plan materials, as \nrequired by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii) for grandfathered plans.   \n  11 \n\n \n62.  Starting on July 1, 2012, Catholic Charities’ health plan will be covered by the \nDiocese’s self-insurance, through the Catholic Employers Benefits Plan, and will be \nadministered by a Third Party Administrator.   \n63.  After July 2012, Catholic Charities’ next plan year, under the Catholic Employers \nBenefits Plan, will begin on January 1, 2013. \nC.  Background on The Catholic Cemeteries Association of the Diocese of Pittsburgh \n64.  Catholic Cemeteries maintains resting places for the deceased in 16 Association-\nowned cemeteries throughout Allegheny and Washington Counties.   \n65.  Additionally, Catholic Cemeteries provides burial-related services to individuals \nthroughout Southwestern Pennsylvania.  \n66.  Catholic Cemeteries provides indigents with free burial space, as well as free \nproducts and services connected with the burial, whenever asked.   \n67.  Catholic Cemeteries also conducts weekly prayer services for the recently \ndeceased and sponsors a monthly mass to commemorate all of the individuals buried that month.  \nThe decedents whose families have registered in Catholic Cemeteries’ “Book of Life” are \nspecifically mentioned at the monthly mass. \n68.  Catholic Cemeteries serves women and men dealing with issues of grief, anger, \nguilt, or forgiveness related to an abortion experience.  It maintains a statue of Rachel Mourning \nin the Holy Innocents Plot section of the Calvary Cemetery.  Catholic Cemeteries provides a \ngranite stone with the child’s first name and year of death that is placed in the Holy Innocents \nPlot.  Catholic Cemeteries will arrange for the burial of the fetus if requested.  These services are \nprovided without disclosure, free of charge, and to all, without regard to religion.  \n  12 \n\n \n69.  Certain cemeteries owned by Catholic Cemeteries contain “Memorials to the \nUnborn” to provide a place for prayer in remembrance of aborted children and to remind all \nvisitors to the cemeteries of the sincerity of the Church’s religious beliefs in this regard.   \n70.  Each cemetery owned by Catholic Cemeteries contains a section where children \nwho die under the age of one are buried.  Catholic Cemeteries provides burial services for these \nchildren at no charge.   \n71.  Through its various services, Catholic Cemeteries provides essential spiritual \nsupport to the Diocese in that burying the dead is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as \nboth a religious rite and a corporal work of mercy.  Catechism of the Catholic Church ¶ 2447.  \n72.  While cemetery plots can only be owned by Catholics, anyone from any religion \ncan be buried in the cemeteries.   \n73.  The cemeteries owned by Catholic Cemeteries have over 400,000 interments and \nentombments and Catholic Cemeteries buries approximately 3,800 individuals per year. \n74.  Catholic Cemeteries has approximately 167 full-time employees and 40 seasonal, \npart-time employees.  These employees perform services ranging from digging graves to \nmaintenance to sales.  Employment at Catholic Cemeteries is not limited to Catholics and \nCatholic Cemeteries does not inquire into its employees’ religious beliefs. \n75.  Catholic Cemeteries currently provides its employees with four health plan \noptions. \n76.  All four health plans are self-insured by the Catholic Employers Benefits Plan.   \n77.  The next plan year for Catholic Cemeteries’ health plans begins on \nJanuary 1, 2013. \n  13 \n\n \n78.  Three of Catholic Cemeteries’ health plan options are grandfathered.  For those \nplans, Catholic Cemeteries has included a statement describing its grandfathered status in plan \nmaterials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii).  While these health plans are \ngrandfathered, Catholic Cemeteries, as explained below, is presently injured by the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate.  \n79.  One of Catholic Cemeteries’ health plan options is not grandfathered, as Catholic \nCemeteries changed its insurer for that plan between March 23, 2010 and November 15, 2010.  \nThis change was made, in part, to avoid adding contraceptive coverage to that plan.  As a result, \nCatholic Cemeteries did not include a statement describing its grandfathered status in plan \nmaterials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii) for grandfathered plans.   \nII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \n80.  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010) (collectively the “Affordable Care Act” or the “Act”). \n81.  The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for “group health \nplans,” broadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plans” within the meaning of the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care  \n. . . to employees or their dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).  \n82.  The Act requires an employer’s group health plan to cover certain women’s \n“preventive care,” leaving the definition of that term up to an agency within HHS.  Specifically, \nit provides that “[a] group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual \nhealth insurance coverage shall, at a minimum[,] provide coverage for and shall not impose any \ncost sharing requirements for—(4) with respect to women, such additional preventive care and \nscreenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources \n  14 \n\n \nand Services Administration for purposes of this paragraph.”  Pub. L. No. 111-148 § 1001(5), \n124 Stat. 131 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4)).   \n83.  Because the Act prohibits “cost sharing requirements,” the health plan must pay \nfor the full costs of these “preventive care” services without any deductible or co-payment.   \n84.  Some provisions of the Affordable Care Act exempt individuals with religious \nobjections.  For example, individuals are exempt from the requirement to obtain health insurance \nif they are members of a “recognized religious sect or division” that conscientiously objects to \nacceptance of public or private insurance funds or are members of a “health care sharing \nministry.”  26 U.S.C. §§ 5000A(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii) (conscientious objectors); 5000A(d)(2)(b)(ii) \n(“health care sharing ministry”). \n85.  Not every employer is required to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate.  \n“Grandfathered” health plans are exempt from the “preventive care” mandate.  Interim Final \nRules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive \nServices Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,731 \n(July 19, 2010) (“Interim Final Rules”); 42 U.S.C. § 18011.  Such plans cannot undergo \nsubstantial change after March 23, 2010 without losing grandfathered status.  Id.  HHS estimates \nthat “98 million individuals will be enrolled in grandfathered group health plans in 2013.”  Id. at \n41,732. \n86.  Violations of the Affordable Care Act can subject an employer and an insurer to \nsubstantial monetary penalties. \n87.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain employers who fail to offer “full-time \nemployees (and their dependants) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under \n  15 \n\n \nan eligible employer-sponsored plan” will be exposed to significant annual fines of $2,000 per \nfull-time employee.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). \n88.  Additionally, under the Internal Revenue Code, group health plans that fail to \nprovide certain required coverage may be subject to an assessment of $100 a day per individual.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, Cong. Research Serv., \nRL 7-5700, Enforcement of the Preventive Health Care Services Requirements of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (2012) (asserting that this assessment applies to employers \nwho violate the “preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n89.  Under the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of HHS may impose a \nmonetary penalty of $100 a day per individual where an insurer fails to provide the coverage \nrequired by the U.S. Government Mandate.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(i); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 (asserting that this penalty applies to insurers who violate the \n“preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n90.  ERISA may provide for additional penalties.  Under ERISA, plan participants can \nbring civil actions against insurers for unpaid benefits.  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700.  Similarly, the Secretary of Labor may bring an enforcement \naction against group health plans of employers that violate the U.S. Government Mandate.  See \n29 U.S.C. § 1132(b)(3); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 (asserting that these penalties \ncan apply to employers and insurers who violate the “preventive care” provision of the \nAffordable Care Act).  \n91.  The Affordable Care Act limits the Government’s regulatory authority.  The Act \nand an accompanying Executive Order reflect a clear intent to exclude abortion-related services \nfrom the Act and the regulations implementing it.  The Act itself provides that “nothing in this \n  16 \n\n \ntitle (or any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to \nprovide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan \nyear.”  42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  The ability “[to] determine whether or not the plan \nprovides coverage of” abortion is expressly reserved for “the issuer of a qualified health plan,” \nnot the Government.  Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n92.  Likewise, the Weldon Amendment, which has been included in every HHS and \nDepartment of Labor appropriations bill since 2004, prohibits an agency from using Government \nfunds to discriminate against an institution based on providing coverage for abortions.  \nSpecifically, “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act [to the Department of Labor and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services] may be made available to a Federal agency or \nprogram . . . if such agency, program, or government subjects any institutional or individual \nhealth care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay \nfor, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. \nL. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n93.  The intent to exclude abortions was instrumental in the Affordable Care Act’s \npassage, as cemented by an Executive Order without which the Act would not have passed.  \nIndeed, the Act’s legislative history could not show a clearer congressional intent to prohibit the \nexecutive branch from requiring group health plans to provide abortion-related services.  For \nexample, the House of Representatives originally passed a bill that included an amendment by \nCongressman Bart Stupak prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion services.  See H.R. \n3962, 111th Cong. § 265 (Nov. 7, 2009).  The Senate version, however, lacked that restriction.  \nS. Amend. No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (Dec. 23, 2009).  To avoid filibuster in the \nSenate, congressional proponents of the Act engaged in a procedure known as “budget \n  17 \n\n \nreconciliation” that required the House to adopt the Senate version of the bill largely in its \nentirety.  Congressman Stupak and other pro-life House members indicated that they would \nrefuse to vote for the Senate version because it failed to adequately prohibit federal funding of \nabortion.  To appease these Representatives, President Obama issued an executive order \nproviding that no executive agency would authorize the federal funding of abortion services.  See \nExec. Order No. 13,535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).   \n94.  The Act was, therefore, passed based on the central premise that all agencies \nwould uphold and follow “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” and to prohibit \nfederal funding of abortion.  Id.   \nB.  Regulatory Background – Defining “Preventive Care” and the Narrow Exemption \n95.  Less than two years later, Defendants have subverted this central premise of the \nAct.  Over that time, they issued interim rules and press releases—none of which followed \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking—that required the federal funding of abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services and commandeered \nreligious organizations to facilitate those services as well.   \n96.  Within four months of the Act’s passage, on July 19, 2010, Defendants issued \ntheir initial interim final rules concerning § 300gg-13(a)(4)’s requirement that group health plans \nprovide coverage for women’s “preventive care.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,726.   \n97.  Defendants improperly dispensed with notice-and-comment rulemaking for these \nrules.   \n98.  Even though federal law had never required coverage of abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services, Defendants claimed both \nthat the APA did not apply to the relevant provisions of the Affordable Care Act and that “it \nwould be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay putting the provisions in these \n  18 \n\n \ninterim final regulations in place until a full public notice and comment process was completed.”  \nId. at 41,730.     \n99.  The interim final rules did not resolve what services constitute “preventive care;” \ninstead, they merely track the Affordable Care Act’s statutory language.  They provide that “a \ngroup health plan . . . must provide coverage for all of the following items and services, and may \nnot impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible) with \nrespect to those items or services: . . . (iv) With respect to women, to the extent not described in \nparagraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided \nfor in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,759 (codified at 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(iv)).   \n100.  The interim final rules did not identify the women’s “preventive care” that the \nDefendants planned to require employer group health plans to cover, nor give any notice as to \nhow it would identify those services.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  Instead, Defendants noted \nthat “[t]he Department of HHS [was] developing these guidelines and expects to issue them no \nlater than August 1, 2011.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,731.     \n101.  Defendants permitted concerned entities to provide written comments about the \ninterim final rules.  See id. at 41,726.  But, as Defendants have conceded, they did not comply \nwith the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.  Id. at 41,730. \n102.  In response, several groups engaged in a lobbying effort to persuade Defendants \nto include various contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in the “preventive care” \nrequirements for group health plans.  See, e.g., Press Release, Planned Parenthood, Planned \nParenthood Supports Initial White House Regulations on Preventive Care (July 14, 2010), \n  19 \n\n \navailable at http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-\nparenthood-supports-initial-white-house-regulations-preventive-care-highlights-need-new-\n33140.htm. \n103.  Other commenters noted that “preventive care” could not reasonably be \ninterpreted to include such practices.  These groups explained that pregnancy was not a disease \nthat needed to be “prevented,” and that a contrary view would intrude on the sincerely-held \nbeliefs of many religiously affiliated organizations by requiring them to pay for services that \nviolate their religious beliefs.  See, e.g., Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops,  \nat 1-2 (Sept. 17, 2010), available at http://old.usccb.org/ogc/preventive.pdf.   \n104.  On August 1, 2011, HHS issued the “preventive care” services that group health \nplans would be required to cover.  See Press Release, HHS, Affordable Care Act Ensures \nWomen Receive Preventive Services at No Additional Cost (Aug. 1, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html.  Again acting without notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking, HHS announced these guidelines through a press release rather than \nenactments in the Code of Federal Regulations or statements in the Federal Register.  The press \nrelease made clear that the guidelines were developed by a non-governmental “independent” \norganization, the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”).  See id.   \n105.  In developing the guidelines, IOM invited certain groups to make presentations on \npreventive care.  On information and belief, no groups that oppose government-mandated \ncoverage of abortion, contraception, and related education and counseling were among the \ninvited presenters.  Comm. on Preventive Servs. for Women, Inst. of Med., Clinical Preventive \nServices for Women app. B at 217-21 (2011), \nhttp://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13181&page=R1. \n  20 \n\n \n106.  The IOM’s own report, in turn, included a dissent that suggested that the IOM’s \nrecommendations were made on an unduly short time frame dictated by political considerations, \nthrough a process that was largely subject to the preferences of the committee’s composition, and \nwithout the appropriate transparency for all concerned persons.        \n107.  In stark contrast with the central premise necessary for the Affordable Care Act’s \npassage and President Obama’s promise to protect religious liberty, HHS’s new guidelines \nrequired insurers and group health plans to cover “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all \nwomen with reproductive capacity.”  See Health Res. Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, available at \nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/.  \n108.  Contraceptives approved by the FDA that qualify under these guidelines cause \nabortions.  For example, the FDA has approved “emergency contraceptives” such as the \nmorning-after pill (otherwise known as Plan B), which destroys the embryo by preventing it \nfrom implanting in the womb, and Ulipristal (otherwise known as HRP 2000 or Ella), which \nlikewise can induce abortions of living embryos. \n109.  A few days later, on August 3, 2011, Defendants issued amendments to the \ninterim final rules that they had previously enacted in July 2010.  See Group Health Plans and \nHealth Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011).   \n110.  Defendants issued the amendments again without notice-and-comment \nrulemaking on the same grounds (namely, that it would be “impracticable and contrary to the \n  21 \n\n \npublic interest to delay” putting the rules into effect) that they had provided for bypassing the \nAPA with the original rules.  See id. at 46,624.       \n111.  When announcing the amended regulations, Defendants ignored the view that \n“preventive care” should exclude abortifacients, sterilization services, and contraceptives that do \nnot prevent disease.  Instead, they noted only that “commenters [had] asserted that requiring \ngroup health plans sponsored by religious employers to cover contraceptive services that their \nfaith deems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious freedom.”  Id. at \n46,623.   \n112.  Defendants sought “to provide for a religious accommodation that respect[ed]” \nonly “the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial \npositions.”  Id.   \n113.  Specifically, the regulatory “religious employer” exemption ignored definitions of \n“religious employer” already existing in federal law and, instead covered only those employers \nwhose purpose is to inculcate religious values, and who employ and serve primarily individuals \nwith the same religious tenets.  It provides in full: \n (A) In developing the binding health plan coverage guidelines specified in this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iv), the Health Resources and Services Administration shall be \ninformed by evidence and may establish exemptions from such guidelines with \nrespect to group health plans established or maintained by religious employers \nand health insurance coverage provided in connection with group health plans \nestablished or maintained by religious employers with respect to any requirement \nto cover contraceptive services under such guidelines. \n \n(B) For purposes of this subsection, a “religious employer” is an organization \nthat meets all of the following criteria: \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization. \n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization. \n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization. \n  22 \n\n \n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section \n6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986, as amended. \n \nId. at 46,626 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(A)-(B)).   \n114.  This regulation delegates to a branch within Defendant HHS the job of issuing \nexemptions on an ad hoc and subjective basis by allowing that branch to determine which \norganizations meet this definition of “religious employer.”   \n115.  The religious employer exemption also mandates an unconstitutionally invasive \ninquiry into an organization’s religious purpose, beliefs, and practices.   \n116.  Similarly, the religious employer exemption further mandates an impermissibly \ninvasive inquiry into the private religious beliefs of the individuals an organization employs and \nserves. \n117.  The religious employer exemption also uses impermissibly vague, undefined \nterms that extend the agency’s already broad discretion and fail to provide organizations with \nnotice of their duties and obligations.  There is no definition for the vague terms “inculcation of \nreligious values,” “purpose of the organization,” “primarily,” and “religious tenets.”  Similarly, \nthere is no indication of whether an agency with multiple purposes can qualify and how much \noverlap there must be for religious tenets to be “share[d].” \n118.  Defendants created such a narrow exemption that there is arguably no exemption \nfor any religious organization that views its mission as providing charitable, educational, and \nemployment opportunities to all those who request it, regardless of the requesters’ religious faith. \n119.  When issuing this interim final rule, Defendants did not explain why they issued \nsuch a narrow religious exemption.  Nor did Defendants explain why they refused to incorporate \nother “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” that President Obama’s executive order \n  23 \n\n \npreviously had promised to respect.  See Exec. Order No. 13,535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, \n2010).   \n120.  ERISA, for example, has long excluded “church plans” from its requirements, \nmore broadly defined to cover civil law corporations, including entities, like Catholic Charities \nand Catholic Cemeteries, that share religious bonds with a church.  See 29 U.S.C. \n§§ 1002(33)(C)(iv), 1003.   \n121.  Nor did Defendants consider whether they had a compelling interest to require \nreligiously affiliated employers’ health plans to include services that violate the employers’ \nreligious beliefs, or whether Defendants could achieve their views of sound policy in a more \nreligiously accommodating manner. \n122.  Suggesting that they were open to good-faith discussion, Defendants once again \npermitted parties to provide comments to the amended rules.  Numerous organizations expressed \nthe same concerns that they had before, noting that abortifacients, sterilization services, and \ncontraceptives could not be viewed as “preventive care.”  They also explained that the religious \nexemption was “narrower than any conscience clause ever enacted in federal law, and narrower \nthan the vast majority of religious exemptions from state contraceptive mandates.”  Comments of \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops at 1-2 (Aug. 31, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/comments-to-hhs-on-\npreventive-services-2011-08.pdf.   \n123.  Bishop Zubik wrote to Secretary Sebelius opposing the Affordable Care Act \nnoting that it was “so narrowly drawn that it is unprecedented in federal law” and that it “is an \nattack on Catholic beliefs and on the religious liberty of Catholics to adhere to their beliefs as \nthey serve the community in which they live.”  Bishop Zubik also sent a letter to the parishioners \n  24 \n\n \nwithin the Diocese on September 22, 2011 explaining the narrow religious exemption and asking \nthem to write to Secretary Sebelius opposing the Affordable Care Act.   \n124.  Shortly thereafter, on October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke at a fundraiser \nfor NARAL Pro-Choice America.  NARAL Pro-Choice America is a pro-abortion organization \nthat opposes many Catholic teachings.  She told the pro-abortion audience that “we are in a war,” \napparently with opponents of either federal funding of abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services or federal mandates requiring coverage for \nabortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services in health \ncare plans.   \n125.   Three months later, allegedly “[a]fter evaluating [the new] comments” to the \ninterim final rules, the Defendants gave their response.  They did not request further discussion \nor attempts at compromise.  Nor did they explain the basis for their decision.  Instead, Defendant \nSebelius issued a short, Friday-afternoon press release.  See Press Release, HHS, A Statement by \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (Jan. 20, 2012), \navailable at http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html.   \n126.  The press release announced a one-year “safe harbor” from enforcement.  With \nlittle analysis or reasoning, HHS opted to keep the religious employer exemption unchanged, but \nindicated that “[n]onprofit employers who, based on religious beliefs, do not currently provide \ncontraceptive coverage in their insurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until \nAugust 1, 2013, to comply with the new law.”  Id.   \n127.  Taken together, these various rules and press releases amount to a mandate that \nrequires most religiously affiliated organizations to sponsor, provide, and/or facilitate coverage \nfor abortifacients, sterilization services, contraception, and related counseling services through \n  25 \n\n \nthe health plans that they offer employees.  As noted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the “safe \nharbor” effectively gave objecting religious institutions “a year to figure out how to violate \n[their] consciences.”  In the words of Bishop Zubik, “[t]he Obama administration has just told \nthe Catholics of the United States, ‘To Hell with you!’” \nC.  The White House Has Refused to Expand the Exemption \n128.  On February 10, 2012, given the continued public outcry to the U.S. Government \nMandate and its exceedingly narrow conscience protections, the White House held a press \nconference and issued another press release about the U.S. Government Mandate, announcing \nthat it had come up with a “solution” to their religious objections.   \n129.  According to the White House, Defendants plan to issue regulations at some \nunspecified date prior to August 1, 2013 to exempt religious organizations that have religious \nobjections to providing coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraception, and \nrelated counseling services from directly paying for those services under the terms of their health \nplans.   \n130.  When such religious organizations provide health plans to their employees, the \n“insurance company will be required to directly offer . . . contraceptive care free of charge.”  \nWhite House, Fact Sheet: Women’s Preventive Services and Religious Institutions  \n(Feb. 10, 2012), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-\nwomen-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutions.   \n131.  The White House thus treats the sincerely-held beliefs of religious organizations \nas an issue of accounting.  This “solution” uses accounting gimmicks that purport to prevent the \n“cost” of the services from showing up directly on the organizations’ financial statements.   \n132.  The “solution” ignores, however, that the religious organizations are opposed to \nfacilitating these services.  The “solution,” therefore, does not address the actual religious liberty \n  26 \n\n \nissue—that the U.S. Government Mandate does not allow religious employers to purchase health \nplans that exclude coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related \ncounseling services. \n133.  Despite continued objections that this “accommodation” did nothing of substance \nto protect the right of conscience, when asked if there would be further room for compromise, \nWhite House Chief of Staff Jacob Lew responded:  “No, this is our plan.”  David Eldridge  \n& Cheryl Wetzstein, White House Says Contraception Compromise Will Stand, The Washington \nTimes, Feb. 12, 2012, available at http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/12/white-\nhouse-birth-control-compromise-will-stand/print/.     \n134.  Defendants have since finalized, “without change,” the interim rules containing \nthe religious employer exemption, 77 Fed. Reg. at 8,729 (Feb. 15, 2012), and issued guidelines \nregarding the previously announced “temporary enforcement safe harbor” for “non-exempted, \nnon-profit religious organizations with religious objections to such coverage.”  Id. at 8,725; see \nCtr. for Consumer Info. & Ins. Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor \n(Feb. 10, 2012), available at http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-\nPreventive-Services-Bulletin.pdf. \n135.  The U.S. Government Mandate is therefore the current, operative law.   \n136.  The U.S. Government Mandate infringes Plaintiffs’ religious liberty while \nignoring the basic procedural safeguards that would give Plaintiffs notice of their duties and \nobligations, as well as recourse beyond the courts.  The Government is proceeding without \nproperly promulgated regulations, without definitions for key terms, and without a procedure for \nappeal. \n  27 \n\n \n137.  Constitutional processes have been enacted for agencies to pass regulations, \nconsistent with congressional direction, through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  The \nAdministration’s insistence on regulation via press release and bureaucratic fiat violates \nseparation of powers principles and destroys political accountability.  That the Administration \nhas retained discretion to unilaterally exempt some institutions only exacerbates the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate’s constitutional infirmity.  Plaintiffs should not have to beg the \nAdministration for an exemption and enter a bureaucratic black hole where no procedure, \ndecision making standards, or appellate rights exist.  The Constitution and federal law demand \nmore.   \n138.  The Administration, moreover, has exceeded its authority under the very Act that \nit purports to be enforcing.  By its terms, the Affordable Care Act cannot require health plans to \ncover abortion services.  The Administration has ignored Congress’ direction and has demanded \nthat all health plans provide access to abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and \nrelated counseling services.  The Administration is substituting its opinion—regardless of its \njustification—for that of Congress.  \n139.  On March 16, 2012, the Government announced an Advance Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking (“ANPRM”), seeking comment on various ways to structure the proposed \naccommodation.  Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).   \n140.  The ANPRM launches a 90-day comment period, to be followed by several other \nsteps in the rulemaking process; it offers no clear end date other than repeating the assurance that \nan accommodation will be in place by August 1, 2013.  See id.    \n  28 \n\n \n141.  The ANPRM’s recurring theme is that the Government has not found a solution to \nthe problems it created when it promulgated its U.S. Government Mandate.   \n142.  In fact, the ANPRM contains little more than a recitation of proposals, \nhypotheticals, and “possible approaches.”  It offers almost no analysis of the relative merits of \nthe various proposals.  It is, in essence, an exercise in public brainstorming.   \n143.  This “regulate first, think later” approach is not an acceptable method of \nrulemaking when the Government is regulating in a way that may require monumental changes \nof the regulated entities. \n144.  The ANPRM does not alter existing law.  It merely states that the Government \nmay do so at some point in the future.  But a promise to change the law, whether issued by the \nWhite House or in the form of an ANPRM does not, in fact, change the law.   \n145.  Nor does the ANPRM alter the scope of the narrow religious employer \nexemption.   \n146.  The ANPRM does nothing of substance to avoid involving Plaintiffs in the \nsubsidy, provision, and/or facilitation of coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services or otherwise eliminate the constitutional infirmity \nof the U.S. Government Mandate. \n147.  Health plans do not take shape overnight.  Many analyses, negotiations, and \ndecisions must occur before Plaintiffs can implement health plans for their employees. \n148.  For example, an employer that is self-insured—like the Diocese, Catholic \nCemeteries, or Catholic Charities as of July 1, 2012— must work with actuaries to evaluate its \nfunding reserves and then must negotiate with its third-party administrator (“TPA”).   \n  29 \n\n \n149.  Under normal circumstances, in which Plaintiffs are only making minor changes \nto their employee health plans, Plaintiffs need more than twelve months lead time to analyze, vet, \nand implement plan changes.  For example, the Diocese finalizes rates for the next plan year in \nearly Fall.  This means that in September, the Diocese will begin projecting costs for its 2013-\n2014 fiscal year, which includes the plan year that begins on January 1, 2014, but will not know \nwhat to factor into these projections because of the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Government \nMandate.   \n150.  Thus, implementing even basic changes to Plaintiffs’ health plans requires \nsubstantial lead time.   \n151.  The U.S. Government Mandate, however, may require Plaintiffs to make \nsignificant, and likely revolutionary changes, to their employee coverage.  Plaintiffs, moreover, \nmay need to restructure their programs or health plans to fit within the U.S. Government \nMandate’s requirements.  Such changes will require substantially more lead time.  \n152.  Even assuming Plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of the safe harbor, Plaintiffs \nmust be prepared to implement modified health coverage, whatever that may end up being, for \ntheir employee health plans by January 1, 2014.   \n153.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus imposes a present and ongoing hardship on \nPlaintiffs. \nIII.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE, THE PROPOSED ACCOMMODATION, \nAND THE RELIGIOUS EMPLOYER EXEMPTION VIOLATE PLAINTIFFS’ \nRELIGIOUS BELIEFS \nA.  The U.S. Government Mandate Violates Plaintiffs’ Religious Beliefs \n154.  Plaintiffs have well-established religious beliefs that prohibit them from \nsubsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, and \ncontraceptives, as well as related counseling services.   \n  30 \n\n \n155.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or \nfacilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, and contraceptives, as well as related \ncounseling services. \n156.  Plaintiffs’ well-established religious beliefs flow from a unified system of beliefs \narticulated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  One of the central tenets of this system is \nbelief in the sanctity of human life and the dignity of all persons.  Thus, Plaintiffs believe, in \naccordance with the Catechism of the Catholic Church, that the “dignity of the human person is \nrooted in his creation in the image and likeness of God.”  Catechism of the Catholic  \nChurch ¶ 1700. \n157.  One outgrowth of belief in human life and dignity is Plaintiffs’ well-established \nbelief that “[h]uman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of \nconception.”  Id. ¶ 2270.  As a result, Plaintiffs believe that abortion is prohibited and that they \ncannot facilitate the provision of abortions.  Id. ¶¶ 2271-72. \n158.  Plaintiffs adhere to Catholic teachings that prohibit any action which “render[s] \nprocreation impossible” and which, more specifically, regard direct sterilization as \n“unacceptable.”  ¶¶ 2370, 2399.     \n159.  The Church, however, does not oppose the use of drugs commonly used as \ncontraceptives when a physician prescribes the medication not for the purpose of acting as a \ncontraceptive, but rather with the intent of remedying another medical condition.   \n160.  Consistent with Church teachings, Plaintiffs’ employee health plans exclude \ncoverage for abortion and sterilization.   \n  31 \n\n \n161.  Consistent with Church teachings, Plaintiffs’ employee health plans cover drugs \ncommonly used as contraceptives only when prescribed with the intent of treating another \nmedical condition, not with the intent of preventing pregnancy.  \n162.  Plaintiffs cannot, without violating their sincerely-held religious beliefs, offer \ncoverage for these or other devices, drugs, procedures, or services that are inconsistent with the \nteachings of the Catholic Church. \n163.  The U.S. Government Mandate irreconcilably conflicts with Plaintiffs’ well-\nestablished, sincerely-held beliefs that strictly forbid the subsidy, provision, and/or facilitation of \ncoverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services \nthat the U.S. Government Mandate forces upon them.   \n164.  All of the required “contraceptive methods” and “sterilization procedures” violate \nPlaintiffs’ well-established and sincerely-held religious beliefs that prohibit contraception and \nsterilization to inhibit procreation. \n165.  Refusal or failure to provide coverage for these drugs and services can expose \nPlaintiffs to substantial monetary penalties.  \n166.  This unprecedented, direct assault on the religious beliefs of Plaintiffs and all \nCatholics is irreconcilable with American law.   \n167.  Since the founding of this country, one of the basic freedoms central to our \nsociety and legal system is that individuals and institutions are entitled to freedom of conscience \nand religious practice.  See, e.g., James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious \nAssessments, ¶ 1 (1785).   \n  32 \n\n \n168.  Requiring Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate devices, drugs, \nprocedures, or services that violate Plaintiffs’ beliefs constitutes a substantial burden on \nPlaintiffs’ free exercise of religion. \n169.  Indeed, the Government does not provide Plaintiffs the option of attempting to \navoid the U.S. Government Mandate by exiting the health care market.  Eliminating its employee \ngroup health plan would expose each Plaintiff to substantial fines.   \n170.  It is no “choice” to leave their employees scrambling for health insurance while \nsubjecting Plaintiffs to significant fines for breaking the law.  Yet that is what the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate requires for Plaintiffs to adhere to their religious beliefs.  The Government \nhas no compelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs by \nrequiring them to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate access to abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services.   \n171.  The Government itself has relieved numerous other employers from this \nrequirement by exempting grandfathered plans and plans of employers it deems to be sufficiently \nreligious.  Moreover, these services are widely available in the United States.  The U.S. Supreme \nCourt has held that individuals have a constitutional right to use such services.  And nothing that \nPlaintiffs do inhibits any individual from exercising that right.   \n172.  The U.S. Government Mandate also seeks to compel Plaintiffs to fund “patient \neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  It therefore compels \nPlaintiffs to provide, subsidize, and/or facilitate speech that is contrary to their firmly held \nreligious beliefs.   \n173.  Furthermore, the U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to promoting \na compelling governmental interest.  Even assuming the interest was compelling, the \n  33 \n\n \nGovernment has numerous alternatives to furthering that interest other than forcing Plaintiffs to \nviolate their religious beliefs.   \n174.  For example, the Government could provide or pay for the objectionable services \nthrough expansion of its existing network of family planning clinics funded by HHS under Title \nX or through other programs established by a duly enacted law.  Or, at a minimum, it could \ncreate a broader exemption for religious employers, such as those found in numerous state laws \nthroughout the country and in other federal laws.   \n175.  The Government therefore cannot possibly demonstrate that requiring Plaintiffs to \nviolate their consciences is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. \nB.  The Proposed Accommodation Provides No Protection \n176.  The Government has proposed an “accommodation” or “solution” whereby the \ninsurer will purportedly pay for the required preventive care, at no cost to the religious employer. \n177.  The proposed accommodation acknowledges that it violates Plaintiffs’ religious \nbeliefs to pay directly for coverage of abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and \nrelated counseling services. \n178.  However, the accommodation fails to take into account that it violates Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate the objectionable services.   \n179.  Thus, under the logic of the “accommodation,” these Plaintiffs are being forced to \nviolate their religious beliefs. \n180.  The “accommodation” does not affect the narrow exemption applicable to \n“religious employers.”  Before they may even qualify for that narrow exemption, religious \norganizations must submit to an invasive governmental inquiry conducted by HHS, under the \ndirection of Secretary Sebelius.  Requiring Plaintiffs to submit to this government-conducted test \n  34 \n\n \nto determine if Plaintiffs are sufficiently religious is inappropriate and substantially burdens their \nfirmly held religious beliefs.   \n181.  Moreover, the proposed accommodation to the U.S. Government Mandate is \npredicated on an accounting gimmick that would not affect the actual operation of the regulations \nas applied to religious organizations.   \n182.  Abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling \nservices cost money.  If the insurer or any other entity is required to pay for those drugs and \nservices, it will pass those costs on to employers in some way.  \n183.  Even if Plaintiffs will not be directly and immediately paying for these drugs and \nservices, they ultimately will foot the bill for their cost. \n184.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are not assisted by the accommodation’s accounting \ngimmicks.   \n185.  Even if Plaintiffs do not end up paying for the prohibited drugs and services, they \nwill still be forced to violate their religious beliefs by facilitating the provision of those drugs and \nservices.   \n186.  Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs prohibit facilitating the provision of these drugs and \nservices, not just directly paying for them. \n187.  The Catholic Church’s consistent teaching in opposition to abortion, sterilization, \nand contraception cannot be addressed through such sleight of hand.  Plaintiffs will be forced to \nsubsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for drugs, services, and education that violate their \nreligious beliefs. \n \n \n  35 \n\n \nC.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Aggravates  \nthe Constitutional and Statutory Violations  \n188.  The constitutional and statutory violations of the U.S. Government Mandate are \naggravated, not alleviated, by its “religious employer” exemption. \n189.  The religious employer exemption substantially burdens the religious exercise of \nPlaintiffs.  The exemption forces Plaintiffs to choose between their religious beliefs (that \nabortion, sterilization, and contraception are strictly forbidden), their mission (educating, \nservicing, and employing individuals of all faith traditions to enrich and enlighten), and obeying \nthe law.   \n190.  In addition to believing in the sanctity of human life from conception, Plaintiffs \nbelieve that devotion to God is demonstrated through devotion to fellow man and service of \nothers; the two are so closely related and dependent upon each other that they cannot be \nseparated.  Catholic doctrine recognizes that, “[l]iving faith ‘work[s] through charity.’” \nCatechism of the Catholic Church ¶ 1814. \n191.  To effectuate this religious belief, Plaintiffs—like the Catholic Church that \ninspires their work—are committed to serving anyone in need, regardless of religion.  The \nschools of the Diocese are open to children of every religion; the social service programs of \nCatholic Charities and its Free Health Care Center do not ask the religion of the people they \nserve; and Catholic Cemeteries employs and serves individuals of all faiths.   \n192.  Although the Government exempts some religious institutions from the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, it has crafted such a narrow exemption that thousands of religious \ninstitutions and countless religious individuals are being forced to make the unconscionable \n“choice” between violating their religious beliefs or violating the law.   \n  36 \n\n \n193.  Both the Constitution and RFRA protect religious institutions, whether or not \ntheir purpose is the “inculcation of religious values” and whether or not they “primarily” serve \nand employ people with shared “religious tenets.”   \n194.  However, only institutions with such a narrow purpose and with such limitations \non employees and services qualify for the religious employer exemption under the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)(1).   \n195.  Forcing Plaintiffs to choose between violating their religious beliefs or violating \nthe law constitutes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ exercise of their religion, which is \nprotected by the Constitution and RFRA. \n196.  The Government has not provided any process by which the Diocese can \ndetermine whether it fits within the exemption. \n197.  It is unclear whether the Diocese will qualify for the exemption. \n198.   It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret religious “purpose.”  \n199.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret vague terms, such as \n“primarily,” “share” and “religious tenets.”  \n200.  It is unclear how the Government will ascertain the “religious tenets” of an entity, \nthose it employs, and those it serves. \n201.  It is unclear how much overlap the Government will require for religious tenets to \nbe “share[d].” \n202.  It is unclear whether the other Plaintiffs qualify for the exemption. \n203.  Though the Government’s position is unclear, it appears that if an entity qualifies \nas a “religious employer” for purposes of the exemption, any affiliated corporation that provides \ncoverage to its employees through the exempt entity’s group health plan would also receive the \n  37 \n\n \nbenefit of the exemption.  Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. \nReg. at 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012). \n204.  If the Diocese qualifies as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Catholic Charities and Catholic Cemeteries thus also appear to receive the \nbenefit of the exemption.  \n205.  The limited and ill-defined religious employer exemption provided in the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate conflicts with the Constitution. \n206.  Moreover, the process by which the Government proposes to determine whether \nan organization—such as the Diocese—qualifies for the exemption, will require the Government \nto engage in an intrusive inquiry into whether, in the view of HHS, the Diocesan “purpose” is the \n“inculcation of religious values” and whether the Diocese “primarily” employs and serves people \nwho “share” its “religious tenets.”  The standards are impermissibly vague and subjective.   \n207.  By basing the exemption on shared religious tenets, the U.S. Government \nMandate compels Plaintiffs to consider restructuring their admissions, employment, and service \nprograms to discriminate on the basis of religion in an overt and potentially illegal fashion.   \n208.  Any attempt by Plaintiffs to qualify for the narrow religious employer exemption \nby restricting their charitable and educational mission to Catholics would have devastating \neffects on the communities encompassed within the Diocese’s borders.   \n209.  The Diocesan schools would be forced to inquire both into the nature and \nsincerity of the faith of prospective students, turning away Protestants, Muslims, Jews, atheists, \nand those that the Government may not find to be sufficiently Catholic—or at the very least, \nimposing strict quotas that ensure the Diocese does not “primarily” educate such students.   \n  38 \n\n \n210.  Financial and tuition assistance programs designed to reach poor and \nunderprivileged families and students regardless of religion would have to be similarly \nredesigned to exclude non-Catholics.  Access to a wide array of grants could be cut off, programs \ncould be terminated, and the overall quality of education and services the Diocese could offer \nwould sharply diminish.   \n211.  Such a severe limitation on access to Catholic Charities alone would be \ndevastating to the communities it serves.  From housing and homelessness services to counseling \nand other neighborhood based services, Catholic Charities is the lifeblood of the communities it \nserves.   \n212.  For more than 100 years, Catholic Charities has assisted people in their time of \ngreatest need with safety net and stability services.  These comprehensive services include \nassisting individuals and families with paying utility bills and other expenses all of which are \nespecially significant given current unemployment and underemployment.  The goal of these \nservices is to stop the cycle of need and help people achieve a more stable life.  Catholic \nCharities’ myriad social service programs would be faced with the prospect of turning away \ndesperately needy people.   \n213.  These services are necessary to fill gaps in Government programs.  As President \nObama recognized in his February 10, 2012 announcement, church-related community services \noften do “more good for a community than a government program ever could.”  The U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, however, puts these good works in jeopardy.   \n214.  Ironically, the U.S. Government Mandate’s attempt to broaden access to \nhealthcare would actually narrow that access for people in the Pittsburgh region by limiting the \nFree Health Care Center, which has served over 8,000 working, low, or moderate income \n  39 \n\n \nindividuals regardless of religion, to serving primarily Catholics.  Limiting the Free Health Care \nCenter to Catholics would severely harm the excluded non-Catholics and undermine the Free \nHealth Care Center’s Catholic mission to serve all.   \n215.  Moreover, the Free Health Care Center receives substantial funding from \nfoundations and grants that could be jeopardized by excluding the treatment of sick people on the \nbasis of their religion. \n216.  Using the Affordable Care Act to limit the services provided by the Free Health \nCare Center is especially ironic because the Center has stepped into the breach of serving the \nworking poor who are not currently being served by the Government.   \nD.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Excessively \nEntangles the Government In Religion, Interferes With Religious Institutions’ \nReligious Doctrine, and Discriminates Against and Among Religions \n217.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s religious employer exemption excessively \nentangles the Government in defining the religious tenets of each organization and its employees \nand beneficiaries.   \n218.  In order to determine whether the Diocese—or any other religious organization—\nqualified for the exemption, the Government would have to decide the Diocese’s “religious \ntenets” and determine whether “the purpose” of the organization is to “inculcate” people into \nthose tenets. \n219.  The Government would then have to conduct an inquiry into the practices and \nbeliefs of the individuals that the Diocese ultimately employs and educates. \n220.  The Government would then have to compare and contrast those religious \npractices and beliefs to determine whether and how many of them are “share[d].” \n221.  Regardless of outcome, this inquiry is unconstitutional, and the Diocese strongly \nobjects to such an intrusive governmental investigation into its religious mission.  \n  40 \n\n \n222.  The religious employer exemption is based on an improper Government \ndetermination that “inculcation” is the only legitimate religious purpose.   \n223.  The Government should not base an exemption on an assessment of the “purity” \nor legitimacy of an institution’s religious purpose.  \n224.  By limiting that legitimate purpose to inculcation, at the expense of other \nsincerely-held religious purposes, the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with religious \nautonomy.  Plaintiffs have the right to determine their own religious purpose, including religious \npurposes broader than inculcation, without Government interference and without losing their \nreligious liberties.   \n225.  Likewise, the exemption seeks to improperly limit the definition of legitimate \nreligious organizations to those who primarily employ and serve “persons who share the \nreligious tenets of the organization.”  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)(2)-(3).  This is inconsistent \nwith the definition of religion under the Constitution and RFRA.   \n226.  Defining religion based on primarily employing and serving people who share the \norganization’s religious tenets directly contradicts with Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs \nregarding their religious mission to serve all people, regardless of whether or not they share the \nsame faith.   \n227.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its extremely narrow religious employer \nexemption discriminate against Catholic religious institutions.  \n228.  The U.S. Government Mandate targets Plaintiffs precisely because of their \nreligious opposition to abortion, sterilization, and contraception.   \n229.  The religious employer exemption targets Plaintiffs precisely because of their \ncommitment to educate, serve, and employ all people without regard to religion.  \n  41 \n\n \n230.  Plaintiffs cannot be forced to give up their beliefs on abortion, sterilization, or \ncontraception, nor their devotion to serving all mankind, without violating their religious beliefs \nand compromising their religious purpose.   \n231.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its extremely narrow religious employer \nexemption discriminate among religions.  The U.S. Government Mandate favors religions that do \nnot oppose abortion or contraception by putting the Government imprimatur on those beliefs as \ncorrect.   \n232.  Similarly, the religious employer exemption favors religions that do not believe in \nserving all humanity, by exempting them from its requirements and disfavors religions that \nbelieve in serving all humanity as part of their religious mission, by requiring them to subsidize, \nprovide for, and/or facilitate the coverage of services which violate their religious beliefs. \n233.  As a result of such discrimination, the U.S. Government Mandate is subject to the \nstrictest scrutiny under the Constitution.   \n234.  Despite the efforts of the Government to divide religious institutions by targeting \nspecific religious beliefs, Christian leaders in Pennsylvania, including all of the Catholic Bishops \nof Pennsylvania as members of the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, have jointly recognized \nthat the U.S. Government Mandate infringes on religious liberty and threatens all Christian \ninstitutions, no matter what the beliefs of the religious institution are as to abortion, sterilization, \nand contraception.  In a joint letter from the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference dated March 7, \n2012 and signed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop for Philadelphia, the Roman Catholic \nBishops for Pittsburgh, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Erie, Allentown, Altoona-Johnstown, and \nScranton, as well as the Metropolitan Archbishop for Ukrainians in the USA and the  \n \n  42 \n\n \nAdministrator of the Byzantine Catholic Archdiocese of Pittsburgh, the Christian leaders stated:  \nSome falsely suggest that the HHS mandate is about contraception.  This is \nprimarily about religious liberty and our First Amendment rights to the free \nexercise of our religion.  Make no mistake about it – this government mandate \nis a step which will inevitably lead to other mandates that continue to strike at the \nheart of our Faith and the constitutional liberties we have been guaranteed.   \n235.  Additionally, on April 13, 2012, Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, \none of the largest regional ecumenical agencies in the United States, which consists of leaders of \n26 different sects of Christianity, issued a joint statement in opposition to the U.S. Government \nMandate.  The leaders expressed that:   \nOur deep concern over this mandate does not arise from the \nvarying convictions we have on the moral content of this mandate, \nbut from our common commitment to the right of religious \nfreedom that all people of faith expect to enjoy in this country.  \nThe Constitution of the United States guarantees every religious \ninstitution and its affiliated bodies the inalienable right to define \nits own identity and ministries and to practice its own beliefs, \nnot just its freedom to worship. \n \nE.  The U.S. Government Mandate is Not a Neutral Law of General Applicability \n236.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability.   \n237.  It offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health \nplans subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services.  For example, the U.S. Government Mandate \nexempts all “grandfathered” plans from its requirements until the plans lose that status.   \n238.  It was, moreover, implemented by and at the behest of individuals and \norganizations who disagree with certain religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception, \nand thus targets certain religious organizations and certain religions for disfavored treatment.  \n239.  The Government has crafted a religious exemption to the U.S. Government \nMandate that favors certain religions over others.  As noted, it applies only to plans sponsored by \n  43 \n\n \nreligious organizations that have, as their  “purpose,” the “inculcation of religious values”; that \n“primarily” serve individuals that share their “religious tenets”; and that “primarily” employ such \nindividuals.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)(1).   \n240.  This narrow exemption may protect some religious organizations.  But it does not \nprotect the many Catholic and other religious organizations that educate students of all faiths, \nprovide vital social services to individuals of all faiths, and employ individuals of all faiths.  The \nU.S. Government Mandate thus discriminates against such religious organizations because of \ntheir religious commitment to educate, serve, and employ people of all faiths. \n241.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, was promulgated by Government \nofficials, and supported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose Catholic \nteachings and beliefs regarding marriage and family.   \n242.  For example, Defendant Sebelius has long been a staunch supporter of abortion \nrights and a vocal critic of Catholic teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception.  \n243.  On October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke at a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-\nChoice America.  At that fundraiser, Defendant Sebelius criticized individuals and entities whose \nbeliefs differed from those held by her and the other attendees of the NARAL Pro-Choice \nAmerica fundraiser, stating:  “Wouldn’t you think that people who want to reduce the number of \nabortions would champion the cause of widely affordable contraceptive services?  Not so much.”   \n244.  Consequently, on information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the purpose of the \nU.S. Government Mandate, including the narrow exemption, is to discriminate against religious \ninstitutions and organizations that oppose abortion and contraception.  \nF.  Plaintiffs Have Standing And Their Claims Are Ripe \n245.  Plaintiffs are already being affected by the U.S. Government Mandate.  Plaintiffs \nhave expended significant resources attempting to discern the U.S. Government Mandate, the \n  44 \n\n \nreligious employer exemption, and the safe harbor, and how these provisions will affect \nPlaintiffs.   \n246.  Plaintiffs are currently, and for the foreseeable future will be, negotiating new and \nexisting employee contracts that will be in force when the U.S. Government Mandate begins \napplying to Plaintiffs’ health insurance plans, and by doing so, face an untenable choice of \nwhether to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate or alter their mission of serving all \nregardless of religious beliefs.   \n247.  The fact that Plaintiffs are unsure of the status of their health insurance plans may \nimpact employee recruitment efforts, which may in turn harm Plaintiffs’ educational and social \nservice functions.   \n248.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities has been tangibly harmed by this uncertainty.  Valued \nemployees have left Catholic Charities for jobs that provide greater security in terms of benefits. \n249.  Catholic Charities’ remaining employees are experiencing stress over the status of \ntheir health benefits.   \n250.  Catholic Charities’ hiring is also being affected.  An applicant for a key \nmanagement position did not accept the position because of the uncertainty of Catholic \nCharities’ health plans and continuation as an organization with the mission to serve all. \n251.  Plaintiffs’ funding will likely be significantly impacted by the U.S. Government \nMandate because donors expect that Catholic organizations act in accordance with the teachings \nof the Catholic Church. \n252.  Catholic Charities’ health plan and one health plan for Catholic Cemeteries are \nnot “grandfathered.”  Therefore, those plans must comply with the U.S. Government Mandate \nfor their first plan year after August 1, 2012, or if they qualify for the safe harbor, August 1, \n  45 \n\n \n2013.  And Plaintiffs need substantial lead time in order to make changes to their employee \nhealth plans.   \n253.  Plaintiffs who have grandfathered plans are nevertheless injured presently by the \nU.S. Government Mandate.  These Plaintiffs can no longer alter their plans in the best interests \nof their employees, or because of changing economic circumstances, because such alterations \nwould cost those Plaintiffs their grandfathered status.  If Plaintiffs lose their grandfathered status, \nthey will be forced to choose between complying with the law or abiding by their religious \nbeliefs. \n254.  For example, the Diocese cannot increase its deductible or consider cost-shifting \noptions without jeopardizing its grandfathered status. \n255.  In addition, one parish that is struggling financially to retain its level of benefits is \nconsidering increasing employee contributions for health coverage.  But it cannot present its \nemployees with the options of reduced coverage or increased costs, because either option would \ncost it grandfathered status and could jeopardize that status for the Diocese and other parishes. \n256.  Moreover, other parishes are considering addressing their financial struggles by \naltering employee contributions to family coverage, which costs significantly more than \nindividual or even husband/wife coverage.  But they cannot explore those options or present \nthem to their employees without jeopardizing their and the Diocesan grandfathered status. \n257.  Finally, the plans of the Diocese and Catholic Cemeteries will lose grandfathered \nstatus in the near future because some changes will become essential.  For example, as health \ncare costs rise, plans will need to exceed the 5% limit on increasing their employee contribution \nrates. \n  46 \n\n \n258.  Such changes are inevitable and impending, not speculative and remote.  These \nchanges will result in Plaintiffs losing grandfathered status and thus being forced to comply with \nthe U.S. Government Mandate.  \nIV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise  \nin Violation of RFRA \n259.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n260.  RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s exercise \nof religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the Government \ndemonstrates that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that interest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb. \n261.  RFRA protects organizations as well as individuals from Government-imposed \nsubstantial burdens on religious exercise. \n262.  RFRA applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law by any  \nbranch, department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States. \n263.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs.  \n264.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into their \nreligious beliefs. \n265.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n266.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate.  \n  47 \n\n \n267.  Requiring Plaintiffs to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate is not the least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  \n268.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate against \nPlaintiffs, Defendants have violated RFRA.  \n269.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n270.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT II \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n271.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n272.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government from \nsubstantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion. \n273.  The Free Exercise Clause protects organizations as well as individuals from \nGovernment-imposed burdens on religious exercise. \n274.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs. \n275.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into their \nreligious beliefs.  \n276.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n277.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability, \nbecause it is riddled with exceptions.  It offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that \n  48 \n\n \nemployer-based health plans include or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services. \n278.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it discriminates against certain religious viewpoints and targets certain religious \norganizations for disfavored treatment.  Defendants enacted the U.S. Government Mandate \ndespite being aware of the substantial burden it would place on Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.  \n279.  The U.S. Government Mandate implicates constitutional rights in addition to the \nright to free exercise of religion, including, for example, the rights to free speech and to freedom \nfrom excessive government entanglement with religion.  \n280.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n281.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n282.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate, the \nGovernment has burdened Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise Clause \nof the First Amendment.  \n283.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n284.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \n \n \n \n \n  49 \n\n \nCOUNT III \nExcessive Entanglement in Violation of the  \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n \n285.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n286.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nprohibit intrusive government inquiries into the religious beliefs of individuals and institutions, \nand other forms of excessive entanglement between religion and Government.  \n287.  This prohibition on excessive entanglement protects organizations as well as \nindividuals. \n288.  In order to qualify for the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate for \n“religious employers,” entities must submit to an invasive government investigation into an \norganization’s religious beliefs, including whether the organization’s “purpose” is the \n“inculcation of religious values” and whether the organization “primarily employs” and \n“primarily serves” individuals who share the organization’s religious tenets.  \n289.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus requires the Government to engage in \nintrusive inquiries and judgments regarding questions of religious belief or practice. \n290.  The U.S. Government Mandate results in an excessive entanglement between \nreligion and Government.  \n291.  The U.S. Government Mandate is therefore unconstitutional and invalid.  \n292.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  \n293.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n294.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \n  50 \n\n \nCOUNT IV \nReligious Discrimination in Violation of the  \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n295.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n296.  The Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment mandate \nthe equal treatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference. \n297.  This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n298.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s narrow exemption for certain “religious \nemployers” but not others discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious status.  \n299.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer likewise \ndiscriminates among different types of religious entities based on the nature of those entities’ \nreligious beliefs or practices. \n300.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer furthers no \ncompelling governmental interest. \n301.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer is not narrowly \ntailored to further a compelling governmental interest.  \n302.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  \n303.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n304.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \n \n \n  51 \n\n \nCOUNT V \nInterference in Matters of Internal Church Governance in Violation of the Free Exercise and \nEstablishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n305.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n306.  The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause protect the freedom of \nreligious organizations to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernance as well as those of faith and doctrine.   \n307.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, or \ndoctrine.   \n308.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n309.  Plaintiffs are religious organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.   \n310.  The Catholic Church views abortion, sterilization, and contraception as \nintrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from subsidizing, providing, and/or \nfacilitating those practices.     \n311.  Plaintiffs have abided and must continue to abide by the decision of the Catholic \nChurch on these issues. \n312.  The Government may not interfere with or otherwise question the final decision \nof the Catholic Church that its religious organizations must abide by these views. \n313.  Plaintiffs have therefore made the internal decision that the health plans they offer \nto their employees may not subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services. \n  52 \n\n \n314.  The U.S. Government Mandate interferes with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \nconcerning their structure and mission by requiring them to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate \npractices that directly conflict with Catholic beliefs. \n315.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s interference with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \naffects their faith and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly conflict with \ntheir religious beliefs.     \n316.  Because the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with the internal decision \nmaking of Plaintiffs in a manner that affects Plaintiffs’ faith and mission, it violates the \nEstablishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n317.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n318.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VI \nCompelled Speech in Violation of  \nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \n319.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n320.  The First Amendment protects against the compelled affirmation of any religious \nor ideological proposition that the speaker finds unacceptable. \n321.  The First Amendment protects organizations as well as individuals against \ncompelled speech. \n322.  Expenditures are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. \n323.  The First Amendment protects against the use of a speaker’s money to support a \nviewpoint that conflicts with the speaker’s religious beliefs. \n324.  Plaintiffs consistently hold and publicly proclaim that abortion, sterilization, and \ncontraception violate fundamental tenets of their Catholic religion. \n  53 \n\n \n325.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to provide or sponsor \nhealth care plans to their employees that include or facilitate coverage of practices that violate \ntheir religious beliefs.  \n326.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, \nand/or facilitate education and counseling services regarding these practices.  \n327.  By imposing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants are compelling Plaintiffs \nto publicly subsidize or facilitate the activity and speech of private entities that are contrary to \ntheir religious beliefs. \n328.  The U.S. Government Mandate is viewpoint-discriminatory and subject to strict \nscrutiny. \n329.  The U.S. Government Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n330.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n331.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n332.  The U.S. Government Mandate imposes an immediate and ongoing harm on \nPlaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VII \nFailure to Conduct Notice-And-Comment Rulemaking and Improper  \nDelegation in Violation of the APA \n333.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n334.  The Affordable Care Act expressly delegates to an agency within Defendant \nHHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the authority to establish guidelines \nconcerning the “preventive care” that a group health plan and health insurance issuer must \nprovide.   \n  54 \n\n \n335.  Given this express delegation, Defendants were required to engage in formal \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law before issuing the guidelines that \ngroup health plans and insurers must cover.  Proposed regulations were required to be published \nin the Federal Register and interested persons were required to be given an opportunity to \nparticipate in the rulemaking through the submission of written data, views, or arguments. \n336.  Defendants promulgated the “preventive care” guidelines without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law.    \n337.  Defendants, instead, wholly delegated their responsibilities for issuing preventive \ncare guidelines to a non-governmental entity, the IOM (the Institute of Medicine).   \n338.  The IOM did not permit or provide for the broad public comment otherwise \nrequired under the APA concerning the guidelines that it would recommend.  The dissent to the \nIOM report noted both that the IOM conducted its review in an unacceptably short time frame, \nand that the review process lacked transparency.   \n339.  Within two weeks of the IOM issuing its guidelines, Defendant HHS issued a \npress release announcing that the IOM’s guidelines were required under the Affordable Care Act.  \n340.  Defendants have never explained why they failed to enact these “preventive care” \nguidelines through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA. \n341.  Defendants also failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when issuing \nthe interim final rules and the final rule incorporating the guidelines.  Defendants’ stated reasons \nfor promulgating these rules without engaging in formal notice-and-comment rulemaking do not \nconstitute “good cause.”  Providing public notice and an opportunity for comment was not \nimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest for the reasons claimed by \nDefendants. \n  55 \n\n \n342.  Defendants have since undertaken a prolonged notice-and-comment process to \npromulgate amended regulations, which undermines their claim that good cause warranted \nabandoning notice-and-comment for the current regulations.  \n343.  By enacting the “preventive care” guidelines and interim and final rules through \ndelegation to a non-governmental entity and without engaging in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, Defendants failed to observe a procedure required by law and thus violated 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D).   \n344.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n345.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n346.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate without observance of a \nprocedure required by law and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing \nharm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VIII \nArbitrary and Capricious Action in Violation of the APA \n347.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n348.  The APA condemns agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n349.  The APA requires that an agency examine the relevant data and articulate an \nexplanation for its action that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the \npolicy choice made. \n350.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious under the APA if the agency has failed \nto consider an important aspect of the problem before it. \n  56 \n\n \n351.  A court reviewing agency action may not supply a reasoned basis that the agency \nitself has failed to offer. \n352.  Defendants failed to consider the suggestion of many commenters that \nabortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives as well as counseling and education for these \nservices could not be viewed as “preventive care.”   \n353.  Defendants failed adequately to engage with voluminous comments suggesting \nthat the scope of the religious exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate should be broadened. \n354.  Defendants did not articulate a reasoned basis for their action by drawing a \nconnection between facts found and the policy decisions they made. \n355.  Defendants failed to consider the use of broader religious exemptions in many \nother federal laws and regulations.  Defendants’ promulgation of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolates the APA.  \n356.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n357.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n358.  The U.S. Government Mandate imposes an immediate and ongoing harm on \nPlaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT IX \nActing Illegally in Violation of the APA \n359.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n360.  The APA requires that all Government agency action, findings, and conclusions \nbe “in accordance with law.”   \n361.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its exemption are illegal and therefore in \nviolation of the APA.   \n  57 \n\n \n362.  The Weldon Amendment states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be \nmade available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n363.  The Affordable Care Act states that “nothing in this title (or any amendment by \nthis title) shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] \nservices . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. § \n18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  It adds that “the issuer of a qualified health plan shall determine whether or \nnot the plan provides coverage of [abortion.]”   Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n364.  The Affordable Care Act contains no clear expression of an affirmative intention \nof Congress that employers with religiously motivated objections to the provision of health plans \nthat include coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, or related \ncounseling services should be required to provide such plans. \n365.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires employer based-health plans to subsidize, \nprovide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and \nrelated counseling services.  It does not permit employers or issuers to determine whether the \nplan covers abortion, as the Act requires.  By issuing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants \nhave exceeded their authority, and ignored the direction of Congress. \n366.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates RFRA.  \n367.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment. \n  58 \n\n \n368.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not in accordance with law and thus violates \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n369.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.  \n370.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n371.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate that is not in accordance with \nlaw and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nV.  RELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n1.
