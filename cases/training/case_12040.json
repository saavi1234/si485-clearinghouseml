Persico (as Bishop and Trustee of the Diocese), the St. Martin \nCenter, Inc., and the Prince of Peace Center, Inc. – have sought to invalidate and enjoin \nthis regulation (hereinafter referred to as the ―Mandate‖) on the grounds that it violates \nthe Plaintiffs‘ rights under the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom and Restoration \n1 \n \n\n \n  Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act.  Named as Defendants are the Secretaries \nof the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury as well as \nthe Departments themselves.  This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(4), and 1346(a)(2). \n  Presently pending before the Court is the Defendants‘ motion to dismiss this \naction for lack of standing and/or ripeness.  Plaintiffs have filed a memorandum in \nopposition to this motion, which is supported by various exhibits.1  The matter has been \nfully briefed and argued and is ripe for disposition. \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nDefendants‘ motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, filed pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, concerns the Court‘s ―evry power to \nhear the case.‖  Petruska v. Gannon Univ., 462 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir.2006) (citation \nomitted).  Our Court of Appeals has explained that ―there are two types of Rule 12(b)(1) \nmotions:  those that attack the complaint on its face and those that attack subject matter \njurisdiction as a matter of fact.  When considering a facial attack, ‗the Court must \nconsider the allegations of the complaint as true,‘ and in that respect such a Rule \n12(b)(1) motion is similar to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.‖  Id., at 302 n. 3 (citation omitted).  \nA factual attack, on the other hand,  \ndiffers greatly for here the trial court may proceed as it never could under \n12(b)(6) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.  Because at issue in a factual 12(b)(1) motion \nis the trial court's jurisdiction ... there is substantial authority that the trial \ncourt is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of \nits power to hear the case.  In short, no presumptive truthfulness attaches \nto plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will \n                                                      \n1 In addition, certain interested parties have filed briefs as amicus curiae in this matter. \n2 \n \n\n \n  not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of \njurisdictional claims.  Moreover, the plaintiff will have the burden of proof \nthat jurisdiction does in fact exist.  \n \nId. at 302 n.3 (citation omitted) (ellipsis in the original). \n  Here, the parties are in agreement that the Defendants‘ jurisdictional challenge \nshould be treated as a factual challenge, albeit one in which Plaintiffs‘ factual averments \nstand largely unrebutted.  Both sides further agree that Plaintiffs bear the burden of \nestablishing this Court‘s jurisdiction and, therefore, standing and ripeness.  We proceed \naccordingly. \nII.  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n  The provision being challenged in this lawsuit is, as one court has stated, ―teh \nresult of a complex history of Congressional legislation and agency rulemaking involving \nthe Departments of Labor (‗DoL‘), the Department of the Treasury (‗DoT‘), and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (‗HHS‘) (collectively, the ‗Departments‘).‖  \nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012, WL \n6042864 at *1 (E.D.N.Y.  Dec. 4, 2012).  Because the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York has aptly summarized the relevant legal history of the so-called \n―mandate provision‖ as it pertains to the issues in this case, we quote liberally from the \nCourt‘s decision in Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v. Sebelius: \nIn March 2010, Congress enacted the ACA as well as the Health Care and \nEducation Reconciliation Act.  These acts established a number of requirements \nrelating to ―group health plans,‖ a term which encompasses employer plans that \nprovide health care coverage to employees, regardless of whether the plans are \ninsured or self-insured.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg–91(a)(1); Interim Final Rules for \nGroup Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of \nPreventative Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 75 \nFed. Reg. 41,726, 41,727 (July 19, 2010) (―Interim Final Rules‖).  As is relevant \nhere, the ACA requires that group health plans provide coverage for a number of \n3 \n \n\n \n  preventative medical services at no charge to the patient.  § 300gg–13.  Specially, \nthe ACA provides that a group health plan must ―at a minimum provide coverage for \nand shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for[,]‖ among other things, \nwomen's ―preventative care and screenings ... as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration[.]‖  § \n300gg–13(a)(4).  FN 2 \n \nFN 2. The Health Resources and Services Administration (―HRSA‖) is an \nagency within HHS. \n \nThe ACA's preventative services coverage requirement does not, however, \napply to group health plans that are grandfathered.  See 42 U.S.C. § 18011(a)(2).  A \ngroup health plan is grandfathered when at least one person was enrolled in the \nplan on March 23, 2010 and the plan has continually covered at least one individual \nsince that date.  See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815–1251T(a)(1)(i)(DoT); 29 C.F.R. § \n2590.715–1251(a)(1)(i)(DoL); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a)(1)(i)(HHS).  A plan may lose \nits grandfathered status, however, if, when compared to the terms of the plan as of \nMarch 23, 2010, it eliminates benefits, increases a percentage cost-sharing \nrequirement, significantly increases a fixed-amount cost-sharing requirement, \nsignificantly decreases an employer's contribution rate, or imposes or lowers an \nannual limit on the dollar value of benefits.  See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815–1251T(g)(1) \n(DoT); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715–1251(g)(1)(DoL); 45 C.F.R. §147.140(g)(1) (HHS). \n \nThe Departments began issuing regulations implementing the ACA in \nphases.  On July 19, 2010, they announced that HHS was developing the HRSA \nguidelines and expected to issue them by August 1, 2011.  See Interim Final Rules, \n75 Fed. Reg. at 41,728.  Since there were no existing HRSA guidelines concerning \npreventative care and screenings for women at the time of the Interim Final Rules, \nHHS commissioned the Institute of Medicine (―IOM‖), a Congressionally-funded \nbody, with ―review[ing] what preventative services are necessary for women's health \nand well-being‖ and recommending comprehensive guidelines, as called for by the \nACA.  On July 19, 2011, IOM published a report recommending the inclusion of \ncertain preventative medical services in HRSA's guidelines.  Among other things, \nIOM recommended that group health plans be required to cover ―the full range of \nFood and Drug Administration [―FDA‖]-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization \nprocedures, and patient education and counseling for women with reproductive \ncapacity.‖  FDA-approved contraceptive methods encompass oral conceptive pills, \ndiaphragms, intrauterine devices, and emergency contraceptives, which, according \nto plaintiffs, can cause abortions. \n \nHRSA adopted IOM's recommendations on August 1, 2011.  Two days later, \nthe Interim Final Rules were amended to ―provide HRSA additional discretion to \nexempt certain religious employers from the [HRSA] Guidelines where contraceptive \nservices are concerned.‖  76 Fed. Reg. 46,263 (Aug. 3, 2011).  See also 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A).  In order to qualify for the religious employer exemption, an \norganization must meet all of the following criteria: \n \n  (1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization. \n \n4 \n \n\n \n  (2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious ten[e]ts of \nthe organization. \n \n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization. \n \n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) \nand section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended.  FN3 \n \nFN 3.  These sections of the Internal Revenue Code apply to ―churches, their \nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches,‖ as well \nas ―the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.‖  26 U.S.C. § \n6033(a)(1), (a)(3)(A)(i), (a)(3)(A)(iii). \n \n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B)(HHS).  See also 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715–\n2713(a)(1)(iv)(DoL).  HRSA exercised its discretion under the amended Interim Final \nRules and exempted the religious employers who satisfy these criteria from the \nrequirement of covering contraceptive services.  See Group Health Plans and \nHealth Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventative Services Under the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8,725, 8,726 (Feb. 15, \n2012). \n \nThe Departments received over 200,000 responses to their request for \ncomments on the amended Interim Final Rules.  Many of the comments were \nsubmitted by religiously-affiliated institutions and asserted that the religious \nemployer exemption was too narrow and that the limited scope of the exemption \nraised religious liberty concerns.  Id. at 8,727.  On February 15, 2012, the \nDepartments finalized the amended Interim Final Rules without making any changes \nto the criteria used to determine whether an organization qualified for the religious \nemployer exemption.  Id.  These finalized amended rules are the operative \nregulations at issue in this suit and, together with the HRSA guidelines, constitute \nthe Coverage Mandate.  See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715–2713(a)(1)(iv)(DoL); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv) (HHS). \n \nAt the same time that they finalized the Interim Final Rules, however, the \nDepartments announced a ―temporary enforcement safe harbor‖ period during \nwhich they planned ―to develop and propose changes to these final regulations that \nwould meet two goals — providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing to \nindividuals who want it and accommodating nonexempted, non-profit organizations' \nreligious objections to covering contraceptive services [.]‖  77 Fed. Reg. at 8,727.  \nWithout the safe harbor, non-grandfathered plans would be required to comply with \nthe Coverage Mandate for plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2012.  The \nsafe harbor extended this date, by a year, to plan years beginning on or after August \n1, 2013, during which time the Departments agreed not to take any enforcement \naction against an employer or group health plan that complies with the conditions of \nthe safe harbor.  See HHS, Guidance on Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor, at 3 \n(Aug. 15, 2012), available at http://cciio.cms .gov/resources/files/prev–services–\nguidance–08152012.pdf (last visited Dec. 3, 2012).  In order to comply with the \n5 \n \n\n \n  terms of the safe harbor, the organization must (1) be organized and operate as a \nnon-profit entity, (2) have ―consistently not provided all or the same subset of \ncontraceptive coverage otherwise required at any point‖ from February 10, 2012 \nonward because of the organization's religious beliefs, (3) provide notice to \nparticipants that some or all contraceptive services will not be covered for the first \nplan year beginning on or after August 1, 2012, and (4) provide a certification that it \nsatisfies these criteria. \n \nConsistent with their announced plan ―to develop and propose changes‖ to \nthe Interim Final Rules, on March 21, 2012, the Departments filed an advance \nnotice of proposed rulemaking (―ANPRM‖) in the Federal Register concerning \npossible means of accommodating religious organizations' objections to the \nCoverage Mandate.  See Certain Preventative Services under the Affordable Care \nAct, 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  Specifically, the ANPRM ―presents \nquestions and ideas‖ and provides an ―opportunity for any interested stakeholders to \nprovide advice and input into the policy development relating to the accommodation \nto be made with respect to non-exempted, non-profit religious organizations with \nreligious objections to contraceptive coverage.‖  Id. at 16,503.  One possible \naccommodation that the Departments ―intend to propose‖ is to require health \ninsurance issuers to provide health insurance coverage that excludes contraceptive \nservices to objecting religious organizations while, at the same time, offering \ncontraceptive coverage directly to plan participants without charging either the \nparticipants or the organization.  Id. at 16,505.   \n \nRoman Catholic Diocese of New York v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6042864 at *1-3.   \n \nAs the foregoing discussion explains, the Departments, in their March 21, 2012 \nANPRM, lay out a possible accommodation whereby health insurance companies would \nbe required to offer group health insurance coverage, minus contraceptive coverage, to \nreligious organizations while simultaneously providing contraceptive coverage directly to \nplan participants and beneficiaries.  See Certain Preventive Services Under the \nAffordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503 (Mar. 21, 2012).  Under this proposed \naccommodation, the health insurance company would not be permitted to impose any \ncost-sharing on the part of the plan participants and beneficiaries and would be further \nprecluded from imposing any premium charge to the religious organization relative to \nthis separate contraceptive coverage.  Id.  For religious organizations like the Plaintiffs \nwhich are self-insured, the ANPRM states Defendants‘ intent to propose ―taht a third-\n6 \n \n\n \n  party administrator of the group health plan or some other independent entity assume \nthis responsibility.‖  Id.  According to the ANPRM, the Defendants ―suggest multiple \noptions for how contraceptive coverage in this circumstance could be arranged and \nfinanced in recognition of the variation in how such self-insured plans are structured and \ndifferent religious organizations‘ perspectives on what constitutes objectionable \ncooperation with the provision of contraceptive coverage.‖  Id. \n \n \n2\nIII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n \nA.  The Parties \n1.  Plaintiffs Persico and the Diocese \nPlaintiff, the Most Reverend Lawrence T. Persico, is Bishop and Trustee of \nPlaintiff the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie (the ―Diocese‖).  (Complaint ¶ 2.)3  The \nDiocese is a nonprofit Pennsylvania Charitable Trust with a principal place of \nadministration in Erie, Pennsylvania.  (Id. at ¶ 28.)  It is organized exclusively for \ncharitable, religious, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) \nof the Internal Revenue Code.  (Id.)  The Diocese consists of 117 parishes serving a \nthirteen-county region, including approximately 222,000 individuals of Catholic faith.  (Id. \nat ¶ 42.)   \n                                                      \n2 The following facts are taken from either the Plaintiff‘s complaint or their exhibits in support of their \nmemorandum opposing the pending motion.  In either event, the following averments stand unrebutted on \nthis record. \n \n3 The Complaint originally named as Plaintiff the Most Reverend Donald W. Trautman, proceeding in his \ncapacity as Bishop and Trustee of the Diocese.  On October 9, 2012, the caption was amended to reflect \nthe substitution of Lawrence T. Persico in place of Donald W. Trautman, following Bishop Trautman‘s \nretirement.  (See Order of 10/9/12 [ECF No. 39].) \n7 \n \n\n \n  The Diocese serves both Catholic and non-Catholic residents of Northwestern \nPennsylvania in three main ways:  by educating children within the Diocese‘s school \nsystem, by promoting spiritual growth, and by service to the community.  (Complaint ¶¶ \n2, 6, 40.)  The Diocese carries out this work both on its own and through its support of \nthe Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Erie, whose charitable programs include those \noperated by Plaintiffs St. Martin Center, Inc. (―SMC‖) and Prince of Peace Center, Inc. \n(―PPC‖).  (Id.)   \nThrough its numerous elementary, middle and secondary schools, the Diocese \neducates over 7,500 students of all faiths.  It also offers tuition assistance for students \nbased solely on financial need.  (Complaint ¶ 41.)   \nIn addition to serving the spiritual needs of its Catholic residents and educating \nCatholic and non-Catholic students, the Diocese serves thousands of Northwest \nPennsylvanians through its social services arms.  (Complaint ¶ 44.)  For example, many \nnon-Catholics are served by the Diocese‘s post-abortion ministry, prison ministry, family \nministry, disability ministry, international Diocesan missions, various respect life \norganizations, and the numerous religious and non-religious charities that receive the \nDiocese‘s financial support, including the following:  (a) St. Elizabeth Center, which \noperates a food pantry, thrift store, and clothing shop for lower-income individuals; (b) \nThe Good Samaritan Center, a shelter for homeless men and provider of an emergency \none-family apartment and other assistance; (c) Better Homes for Erie, a provider of \naffordable housing to low-income families; and (d) Catholic Charities Counseling and \nAdoption Services, a provider of professional counseling, adoption counseling, \npregnancy counseling, and refugee resettlement services.  (Id. at ¶ 45.)   \n8 \n \n\n \n  These social service programs, through support from the Diocese, provide aid to \nover 50,000 individuals each year without regard to the individuals‘ religion, race, or \nfinancial condition.  (Id. at ¶ 46.)   The Diocese would not be able to provide all of the \nforegoing social services without the financial contributions of its donors and the work of \nits numerous volunteers.  (Id. at ¶ 48.) \nThe Diocese employs approximately 70 full-time equivalent employees.  (Affidavit \nof David J. Murphy [24-3], Ex. 2 to Pls.‘ Mem. In Opp. to Defs.‘ Mot. to Dismiss, at p. 3, \n¶ 5.)  However, the Diocese does not know how many of its employees are Catholic.  \n(Complaint ¶ 49.)  The Diocese educates and assists tens of thousands of individuals \nbut it is unknown how many of those educated or served by the Diocese are Catholic.  It \nis therefore unclear to the Diocese whether it would qualify for the exemption from the \nchallenged mandate afforded to ―erligious employers.‖  (Id.)   \nThe Diocese operates a self-insured health plan.4  (Complaint ¶ 52.)  Diocesan \nhealth plans are administered by Third Party Administrators (―PTAs‖), which are paid a \nflat administrative fee for each individual covered by the plan.  (Id. at ¶ 53.)  The TPAs \ndo not pay for any services received by the Diocese‘s covered employees.  (Id.) \nThrough its health plan, the Diocese provides health insurance coverage to \napproximately 803 employees, including those employed directly by the Diocese as well \nas those employed by the various parishes, schools, and charitable agencies of the \nDiocese.  The Diocese also covers the dependents of these employees, resulting in a \ntotal of approximately 994 insured individuals.  (Murphy Affid. at ¶ 5.) \n                                                      \n4  As a self-insurer, the Diocese does not contract with a separate insurance company for the provision of \nhealth care coverage; instead, the Diocese itself functions as the insurance company by underwriting the \nmedical costs of its employees and the employees of its affiliated corporations.  (Complaint ¶ 52.) \n \n9 \n \n\n \n  The Diocesan health care plan does not meet the ACA‘s definition of a \n―rgandfathered‖ plan.  Accordingly, the Diocese did not include a statement describing \nits grandfathered status in plan materials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n1251T(a)(2)(ii) .5  (Complaint ¶ 54.)  Under the Diocesan health plan, each new plan \nyear commences annually on July 1.  (Id. at ¶ 55.) \n2.  Plaintiff The Saint Martin Center, Inc. \nPlaintiff SMC is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) affiliate corporation of Catholic Charities \nwith its principal place of business in Erie, Pennsylvania.  (Complaint ¶ 29.)  SMC \nprovides needy individuals and families, regardless of their religious affiliation, with \nresources necessary for them to gain self-sufficiency.  (Id. at ¶ 56.)   \nSMC serves underprivileged individuals within the greater Erie community by \nproviding social services, including an in-house pantry, vouchers for clothing items, \nassistance for rent, mortgage, and utility payments, financial assistance for life-\n                                                      \n5 Defendants initially disputed the Plaintiffs‘ averment that its health care plan does not qualify for \n―grandfathering,‖ on the grounds that the only information asserted in the complaint concerning the plan‘s \nnon-grandfathered status was the Plaintiffs‘ averment that the Diocese had not included a statement of \ngrandfathered status in its plan materials.  Defendants argued that Plaintiffs should not benefit from a \nself-inflicted injury simply by having failed to provide notice in its plan materials of the plan‘s otherwise \n―grandfathered‖ status.  Without more information justifying the conclusion that the Diocese‘s health care \nplan cannot benefit from ―grandfathered‖ status, Defendants argued, the claims premised upon the \nplan(s) should be dismissed due to the Diocese‘s lack of standing. \n    However, in their brief opposing the pending motion to dismiss and supporting materials, the Plaintiffs \nexplain that the Diocese‘s health care plan cannot be considered ―garndfathered‖ because the Diocese \nchanged insurers between March 23 and November 15, 2010.  Specifically, the Diocese represents that \nits health care plan went from being self-insured to fully insured on July 1, 2010 before switching back to \nself-insured status on July 1, 2011.  (See Affidavit of David J. Murphy, Ex. 2 [ECF No. 24-3] to Pls.‘ Mem. \nIn Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at p. 3, ¶ 7.)  According to the pertinent administrative rules, a group health \nplan (including one that was self-insured as of March 23, 2010) ceases to be grandfathered if the plan or \nits sponsor entered into a new policy, certificate, or contract of insurance after March 23, 2010 with an \neffective date prior to November 15, 2010.  45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a)(1)(ii) (2013). \n    Following this representation, Defendants have not pursued their challenge concerning the non-\ngrandfathered status of the Diocese‘s health care plan.  Accordingly, we will assume for present purposes \nthat the Diocese‘s health care plan is, indeed, ineligible for grandfathered status. \n   \n10 \n \n\n \n  sustaining medical prescriptions, vouchers for bus passes and gasoline, guidance for \ncreating a budget, and hot breakfast meals.  SMC also provides various housing-related \nservices such as counseling for potential homebuyers, fair housing and predatory \nlending education, lead paint detection, foreclosure prevention counseling, and financial \nassistance with respect to building code compliance.  In addition, SMC operates an \nearly learning center, provides workforce kitchen skills to individuals in need of work, \nand provides clothing to male individuals attending job interviews and/or reentering the \nworkforce.  (Complaint ¶ 56.)  SMC relies on financial contributions from its donors and \non the work of numerous volunteers, without which it would be unable to provide the \nforegoing services.  (Id. at ¶ 58.) \nSMC has over 50 full-time employees but does not know how many of its \nemployees are Catholic.  Similarly, SMC does not know how many of its beneficiaries \nare Catholic.  (Complaint ¶¶ 59, 61.) \nSMC‘s employees are insured through the Diocese‘s health plan.  (Murphy Affid. \nat ¶ 4; Complaint ¶ 60.) \n3.  Plaintiff Prince of Peace Center, Inc. \nPlaintiff Prince of Peace Center, Inc. (―PPC‖) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) affiliate \ncorporation of Catholic Charities with its principal place of business in Farrell, \nPennsylvania.  (Complaint ¶ 30.)  PPC provides various social and self-sufficiency \nservices to the needy in the greater Mercer County community.  (Id. at ¶ 62.) \nAmong the ways in which PPC serves those in need are through its family \nsupport services, which include PPC‘s HOPE (Help and Opportunity for Personal \nEmpowerment) Advocacy Program as well as its Project RUTH (Resources, \n11 \n \n\n \n  Understanding, Training, and Homes).  (Complaint ¶ 62(a).)  HOPE Advocacy provides \nlonger term support for individuals and families struggling with poverty, while Project \nRUTH is a transitional housing program for homeless single parent families.  All of the \nindividuals served by HOPE Advocacy and Project RUTH are given the opportunity to \nlearn basic life skills necessary for self-sufficiency and family stability through intensive \ncase management and monthly support groups.  (Id.)   \nPPC also operates emergency assistance programs which provide food, clothing, \nfurniture, and appliances, among other things, at little or no cost to those in need.  \nThrough these programs, which are privately funded, PPC is able to offer over $50,000 \nin assistance every year to help pay utility bills and offer other support with the goal of \nkeeping family units together.  PPC‘s AWESOME (Assistance With Education, Shelter, \nOrganization, Money management, and Employment) program assists single men and \nwomen with children who desire to attain self-sufficiency.  (Complaint ¶ 62(b).) \nIn addition to the foregoing, PPC runs a mission thrift store, which provides items \nsuch as clothing and furniture at low cost.  (Complaint ¶ 62(c).)  It operates PA \nWORKWEAR, a program which provides the needy with clothing, accessories, and \ntraining to prepare for job interviews.  (Id at ¶ 62(d).)  It operates a soup kitchen, which \nserves approximately 5,700 individuals each year, and distributes supplemental \ngroceries to approximately 700 individuals annually.   (Id. at ¶ 62(e).)  PPC also runs \ncomputer classes and makes refurbished computers available to its students and holds \nvarious programs and charity drives for underprivileged children in the Mercer County \narea.  (Id. at ¶ 62(f)-(g).)   \n12 \n \n\n \n  PPC does not inquire into the religious beliefs of the individuals it serves.  Its \nmission is to strengthen families, build communities, and reduce poverty among people \nof all ages, faiths, races and backgrounds.  (Complaint ¶ 63.)  Without the financial \ncontributions of its donors and the work of many volunteers, PPC would not be able to \nprovide the foregoing services.  (Id. at ¶ 65.) \nLike SMC, PPC‘s employees are insured through the Diocese‘s health care plan.  \n(Murphy Affid. at 4; Complaint ¶ 66.)  PPC does not know how many of its employees \nare Catholic.  (Id. at ¶¶ 67-68.) \nB.  The Plaintiffs‘ Religious Beliefs \nPlaintiffs‘ work is guided by and consistent with the teaching of the Catholic \nChurch, of which Plaintiffs are a constituent part.  Among the core teachings of the \nCatholic Church is the tenet that life begins at conception and continues through natural \ndeath.  Catholic doctrine therefore regards abortion, sterilization, and contraception as \ngravely contrary to moral law.  (Complaint ¶ 4.) \nCatholic faith also teaches that devotion to God is demonstrated through \ndevotion to all people regardless of their faith or financial condition.  Catholic social \nteaching requires Catholic individuals and organizations to work to create a more just \ncommunity by striving to meet needs wherever they arise.  (Complaint ¶ 5.) \nThrough the educational and social services outlined above, Plaintiffs serve all \npeople, regardless of the individual‘s faith or financial condition.  (Id. at ¶¶ 7, 69.)  \nPlaintiffs‘ commitments to teach and to serve all are part of a larger belief system that \n13 \n \n\n \n  likewise proclaims Catholic teachings on the sanctity of human life and dignity of all \npersons.  (Id. at ¶ 70.) \nC. Plaintiff‘s Complaint \nThis action was commenced on May 21, 2012 with the filing of Plaintiffs‘ \ncomplaint.  In it, Plaintiffs aver that the ACA‘s mandate forces them to take action \nsubsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating coverage for abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services in violation of their religious \nbeliefs.  (Complaint ¶ 21.)   \nWhile the ACA and accompanying regulations have exempted ―erligious \nemployers‖ from the Mandate, Plaintiffs contend that the Diocese does not know \nwhether it satisfies the ACA‘s definition of ―erligious employer.‖  (Complaint ¶ 12.)  In \norder to make this determination, Plaintiffs claim, the Diocese will have to submit to ―an \nintrusive governmental investigation into whether, in the view of the Department of \n[HHS], its ‗purpose‘ is the ‗inculcation of religious values,‘ whether it ‗prmi arily‘ employs \nCatholics, and whether it ‗prmi arily‘ serves Catholics.‖  (Id. at ¶ 12.)  In any event, \nhowever, Plaintiffs SMC and PPC cannot meet the definition of ―erligious employers,‖ as \nthey employ and serve people of all faiths.  (Id. at ¶ 14.)  \nPlaintiffs contend that, to even attempt to qualify as ―erligious employers,‖ they \nmay be required to stop serving and employing non-Catholics – actions which, in \nPlaintiffs‘ view, would betray their religious commitment to serving all in need without \nregard to religion.  (Complaint ¶ 14.)  Thus, Plaintiffs claim, the Government is imposing \nupon them an untenable moral dilemma whereby they must ―cohose between \nrespecting the sanctity of all human life, on the one hand, and fulfilling their religious \n14 \n \n\n \n  mission to provide opportunities and charitable support to all people regardless of their \nfaith, on the other.‖  (Complaint ¶ 8.)  Either way, it is alleged, Plaintiffs will be forced to \nviolate their sincerely held religious beliefs.  (Id. at ¶ 16.) \nPlaintiffs state that their only other choice it to violate the law, either by refusing \nto provide the mandated services or dropping their health plans.  (Complaint at ¶ 15.)  \nThis, it is claimed, might well subject Plaintiffs to substantial fines and penalties, which \nin turn would hamper their ability to provide important services to their communities and \nerode the funds they use to carry out their educational and charitable missions.  (Id.)   \n  Moreover, Plaintiffs contend that they are presently suffering uncertainty as to \ntheir rights and duties in planning, negotiating, and implementing their group health \ninsurance plans, their hiring and retention programs, and their social, educational, and \ncharitable programs and ministries.  (Complaint ¶ 26.)  They maintain that an \nadjudication determining the validity of the Mandate is necessary in order to resolve this \nuncertainty.  (Id.) \n  Plaintiffs‘ complaint sets forth nine causes of action.  Count 1 asserts that the \nMandate violates Plaintiffs‘ rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \ninasmuch as it (i) imposes a substantial burden Plaintiffs‘ exercise of religion (ii) without \nthe justification of a compelling governmental interest and (iii) by means which are not \nthe least restrictive means of furthering the alleged governmental interest.  Counts 2 \nthrough 4 assert various violations of the Plaintiffs‘ First Amendment rights premised \nupon the allegation that the Mandate substantially burdens the Plaintiffs‘ free exercise of \nreligion, discriminates against their religious viewpoint, infringes upon their free speech \nrights, and creates excessive governmental entanglement with their religious practices.  \n15 \n \n\n \n  Count 5 asserts First Amendment violations premised upon the Government‘s alleged \ninterference with matters of internal church governance.  Count 6 asserts that the \nMandate requires Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate education and \ncounseling for certain services they find objectionable and, thereby, compels speech \nwhich violates Plaintiffs‘ religious beliefs, in violation of the First Amendment.  Count 7 \nalleges violations of the APA premised upon the Defendants‘ failure to conduct notice-\nand-comment rulemaking as well as Defendants‘ improper delegation of rulemaking to \nthe IOM.  Count 8 alleges arbitrary and capricious conduct on the part of the \nDefendants in violation of the APA.  Count 9 asserts a claim for failing to act ―ni \naccordance with law‖ in violation of the APA.  Among other things, Plaintiffs seek an \norder enjoining enforcement of the Mandate, vacating the Mandate, and declaring that \nthe Mandate violates Plaintiffs‘ rights under RFRA, the First Amendment, and the APA. \nD. Defendants‘ Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) \nOn August 6, 2012, Defendants filed the pending motion to dismiss the complaint \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  In it, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs lack \nstanding to assert their claims and, in addition, they claim the case is not ripe for \nadjudication. \nDefendants‘ motion is premised on the Government‘s actions, following \nenactment of the ACA, which Defendants say are designed to ameliorate the Plaintiffs‘ \nreligious concerns relative to the Mandate.  In particular, Defendants point to:  (a) the \namendment to the preventative services coverage regulations which exempts certain \n―erligious employers‖ from the Mandate; (b) the issuance of guidance relative to the so-\n16 \n \n\n \n  called ―safe harbor‖ provision, which is applicable to a larger group of ―erligious \norganizations‖ having theological objections to the Mandate, and which precludes \nenforcement of the Mandate as to such organizations until the first plan year beginning \non or after August 1, 2013; and (c) the publication of an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking (―ANPRM‖) in the Federal Register expressing the Government‘s intent to \nfurther amend the regulations in a manner that will accommodate non-exempt, non-\ngrandfathered religious organizations‘ objections to the Mandate. \n  Defendants contend that these measures deprive Plaintiffs of standing because, \nin light of them, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate any imminent injury stemming from the \nMandate.  According to Defendants, the safe harbor provision protects the Plaintiffs \nagainst any enforcement of the Mandate until at least July 1, 2014.  Moreover, \nDefendants say, the absence of any imminent harm is further demonstrated by the \nGovernment‘s initiation of further rulemaking which promises to amend the Mandate, \nwell before July of 2014, so as to accommodate Plaintiffs‘ religious objections.  For \nbasically the same reasons, Defendants insist that Plaintiffs‘ various claims are not ripe \nfor adjudication inasmuch as there is no present adversity of interest between the \nparties and a declaratory judgment would provide neither ―cnoclusivity‖ relative to the \nparties‘ legal relationship nor practical utility. \n  Plaintiffs have filed a memorandum in opposition to the pending motion in which \nthey attempt to outline various injuries they are presently incurring as a result of the \nMandate.  The Plaintiffs‘ memorandum is supported by the affidavits of Mary Maxwell \nand David J. Murphy, which are, in turn, accompanied by various exhibits.  For Rule \n12(b)(1) purposes, these evidentiary submissions stand unrebutted and will be \n17 \n \n\n \n  construed as true and accurate insofar as they assert factual information rather than \nconclusions of law. \n  With this background in mind, we turn to our legal analysis, addressing first the \nissue of ripeness. \nIV.  DISCUSSION \nA.     Ripeness \n―hTe ripeness doctrine is drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power \nand from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.‖  Nat’l Park Hospitality \nAss’n v. Dep’t of the Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003) (citation omitted).  The doctrine \n―serevs to ‗determine whether a party has brought an action prematurely and counsels \nabstention until such time as a dispute is sufficiently concrete to satisfy the \nconstitutional and prudential requirements of the doctrine.‘‖  Khodara Environmental, \nInc. v. Blakey, 376 F.3d 187, 196 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  The ripeness \nrequirement is designed ―t oprevent the courts, through avoidance of premature \nadjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative \npolicies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an \nadministrative decision has been formalized and its effect felt in a concrete way by the \nchallenging parties.‖  Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967).  \n―Vraious considerations underpin the ripeness doctrine, including ... whether the facts of \nthe case are sufficiently developed to provide the court with enough information on \nwhich to decide the matter conclusively, and whether a party is genuinely aggrieved so \nas to avoid expenditure of judicial resources on matters which have caused harm to no \none.‖  Khodara, supra, at 196 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n18 \n \n\n \n  Ascertaining whether an administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires \ncourts to evaluate ―teh fitness of the issues for judicial decision‖ and ―the hardship to the \nparties of withholding court consideration.‖  National Park Hospitality Ass’n, 538 U.S. at \n808 (citing Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 149).  In the context of a declaratory judgment \naction, our circuit applies a ―erfined‖ test for determining ripeness by considering:  ―1() \nthe adversity of the parties‘ interests, (2) the conclusiveness of the judgment, and (3) \nthe utility of the judgment.‖  Khodara, 376 F.3d at 196 (citations omitted). \n   Plaintiffs contend, however, that we should apply a ―erlaxed ripeness‖ standard in \nthis case rather than the foregoing three-step analysis.  Citing Peachlum v. City of York, \nPennsylvania, 333 F.3d 429 (3d Cir. 2003), Plaintiffs point out that ―a[] First Amendment \nclaim, particularly a facial challenge, is subject to a relaxed ripeness standard.‖  Id. at \n434.  That is to say, \ncourts have repeatedly shown solicitude for First Amendment claims \nbecause of concern that, even in the absence of a fully concrete dispute, \nunconstitutional statutes or ordinances tend to chill protected expression \namong those who forbear speaking because of the law‘s very existence.  \nThis concern is particularly acute with regard to facial challenges to a \nstatute or ordinance. \nId. at 434-35 (citing Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973)).   \n   The relaxed ripeness standard in the context of a pre-enforcement challenge \nthus ―stmes from a concern that a person will merely comply with an illegitimate statute \nrather than be subjected to prosecution.‖  Id. at 435 (citation omitted).  Alternatively, ―teh \ngovernment may choose never to put the law to the test by initiating a prosecution, \nwhile the presence of the statute on the books nonetheless chills constitutionally \n19 \n \n\n \n  protected conduct.‖  Id. (citing 13A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. \nCooper, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 3532.5 (2d ed. 1984)). \n  While we acknowledge the application of a relaxed ripeness standard in \nappropriate cases, we do not agree with Plaintiffs that such a relaxed standard applies \nhere.  First, while the Plaintiffs‘ RFRA and First Amendment claims do concern \nfundamental rights, it is not clear that these claims actually present facial, as opposed to \n―asa pplied,‖ challenges to the ACA.6  In the First Amendment context, a law may be \nfacially challenged on the basis of being impermissibly overbroad where ―a sbustantial \nnumber of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly \nlegitimate sweep.‖  Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, \n552 U.S. 442, 449 n.6 (2008).  Because ―[t]eh concept of ‗substantial overbreadth‘ is not \nreadily reduced to an exact definition,‖ Free Speech Coalition, Inc. v. Attorney General \nof U.S., 677 F.3d 519, 537 (3d Cir. 2012 )(citing Members of City Council of City of Los \nAngeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 800 (1984)), courts typically must \nconsider factors such as:  ―(1) the number of valid applications‖ of the statute; (2) the \nhistoric or likely frequency of conceivably impermissible applications; (3) the nature of \nthe activity or conduct sought to be regulated; and (4) the nature of the state interest \nunderlying the regulation.‖  Id. at 537-38 (internal quotation marks omitted; citation \nomitted).  Plaintiffs have not framed their claims in a manner that suggests they are \nasserting a facial challenge to the Mandate on overbreadth grounds, as opposed to \nsimply asserting a direct infringement of their own personal First Amendment rights. \n                                                      \n6 We note that Plaintiffs‘ APA claims do not allege the violation of any fundamental right and, therefore, do \nnot benefit from the relaxed ripeness standard in any event.   \n20 \n \n\n \n  Second, the concerns which underpin the relaxed ripeness standard are not \npresent here.  As Peachlum makes clear, it is the risk of otherwise constitutional speech \nbeing chilled which justifies relaxing the ripeness standard in First Amendment cases \npresenting facial-challenges to an allegedly overbroad regulation.  In such cases, ―eevn \nthe remotest threat of prosecution, such as the absence of a promise not to prosecute, \nhas supported a holding of ripeness where the issues in the case were ‗predominantly \nlegal‘ and did not require additional factual development.‖  Id., 333 F.3d at 435 \n(emphasis supplied).  Here, as we explain in more detail below, there is effectively a \npromise in place by the Defendants not to prosecute the Mandate in its current form; \nthus, no fundamental rights of any party are being affected or will be affected under the \nMandate as it currently stands.7  Nor, to put a finer point on it, is there any allegation by \nPlaintiffs that their own protected speech, or anyone else‘s, is being chilled; rather they \ncomplain that the Mandate in its current form compels them to engage in speech which \nthey find objectionable but in which they have not yet actually engaged.   \n                                                      \n7 For this reason, assuming a relaxed ripeness standard were to be applied here, Plaintiffs cannot \nestablish ―veen the remotest threat of prosecution‖ in light of the Defendants‘ promise not to prosecute \nthem.  See Zubik v. Sebelius,--- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012 WL 5932977 at *7 n.13 (W.D. Pa. Nov.. 27, 2012) \n(finding that, even under relaxed ripeness standard, Plaintiffs‘ claims would not be justiciable, in part \nbecause ―it is not disputed that Defendants have provided a promise not to enforce‖ the Mandate); \nNebraska ex rel. Bruning v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012 WL \n2913402 at *23 (D. Neb. July 17, 2012) (―[P]laintiffs in this case do not face a direct and immediate \ndilemma that involves the sacrifice of their First Amendment rights, and the defendants‘ position on the \nscope of the exemptions to the contraceptive coverage requirements is tentative – and under these \ncircumstances, the plaintiffs cannot establish ripeness even under a relaxed standard.‖) (footnote \nomitted).  See also Tait v. City of Philadelphia, 410 Fed. Appx. 506, 509 (3d Cir. 2011) (First Amendment \nchallenge to city ordinance, which regulated the work of tour guides and required them to obtain \ncertificates before leading tours in certain historic areas of Philadelphia, was not ripe under relaxed \nstandard where there was no evidence that the speech of any tour guide had been chilled and where the \nCity had expressly ―disavowed‖ enforcement of the Ordinance until some indeterminate point in the future \nwhen an announcement would be made that a written test would be administered).   \n  \n21 \n \n\n \n  Finally, this case does not present the type of situation, referenced in Peachlum, \nwhere ―teh issues in the case [a]re ‗predominantly legal‘ and d[o] not require additional \nfactual development.‖  33 F.3d at 435.  Despite the fact that Plaintiffs‘ evidentiary record \nis essentially unchallenged, ―fruther factual development is required to know whether, \nwhen, and how the [amended form of the Mandate] will, in fact, apply to Plaintiffs.‖  Most \nReverend David A. Zubik v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 5932977 at * 7 n.13 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 27, \n2013).  In light of these distinguishing facts, we find that the relaxed ripeness standard \ndoes not apply.   \nHaving identified the appropriate ripeness standard, we turn to an analysis of the \nrelevant factors.  In addressing these issues, however, we acknowledge that this Court \nis not writing on a blank slate.  As of this writing, no less than ten district courts have \nentertained ripeness inquiries in the context of legal claims very similar to those raised \nhere.  Notably, all but one of the courts have found the plaintiffs‘ claims to be unripe.  \nSee Colorado Christian University v. Sebelius, Civil Action No. 11-cv-3350-CMA-BNB, \n2013 WL 93188 (D. Colo. Jan. 7, 2013) (Christian university‘s challenges to the ACA‘s \npreventative services mandate on First Amendment and other grounds was not ripe); \nCatholic Diocese of Peoria v. Sebelius, No. 12-1276, 2013 WL 74240 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 4, \n2013) (claims of Catholic Diocese held unripe); University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, \nCase No. 3:12-CV-253-RLM, 2012 WL 6756332 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 31, 2012) (claims of \nCatholic University found to be unripe); The Catholic Diocese of Biloxi, Inc. v. Sebelius, \nCivil No. 1:12CV158-HSO-RHW (S.D. Miss. Dec. 20, 2012) (claims held unripe); Zubik \nv. Sebelius, supra, 2012 WL 5932977 (same); Catholic Diocese of Nashville v. \nSebelius, No. 3-12-0934, 2012 WL 5879796 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 21, 2012) (same); \n22 \n \n\n \n  Wheaton College v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012 WL 3637162 (D.D.C. Aug. 24, \n2012) (same), appeal held in abeyance, 2012 WL 6652505 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 18, 2012); \nBelmont Abbey College v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012 WL 2914417 (D.D.C. July \n18, 2012) (same), appeal held in abeyance sub nom Wheaton College v.

Neb., \nJuly 17, 2012) (same).8  But see Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v. Sebelius, \nsupra, 2012 WL 6042864 at *20-24 (finding that plaintiffs‘ challenge to ACA‘s \npreventative services mandate was fit for review). \nHaving carefully reviewed the foregoing authority, this Court finds itself to be in \nagreement with the majority of district courts which have dismissed lawsuits virtually \nidentical to this one for lack of ripeness.  We explain this conclusion more fully in our \nanalysis of the relevant factors which follow. \n1.  Adversity of Interest \nAs an initial matter, we find no adversity of legal interests between the parties for \npurposes of the first ripeness prong.  ―Ahltough the [plaintiff] need not have suffered a \n‗completed harm‘ to establish adversity of interest, … it is necessary that there be a \nsubstantial threat of real harm and that the threat ‗must remain real and immediate \nthroughout the course of the litigation.‘‖  Presbytery of New Jersey of Orthodox \nPresbyterian Church v. Florio, 40 F.3d 1454, 1463 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  ―Where the plaintiff‘s action is based on a contingency, it is \n                                                      \n8 Another federal district court has dismissed a similar lawsuit by a non-profit religious organization for \nlack of standing.  See Legatus v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2012 WL 5359630 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 31, \n2012). \n23 \n \n\n \n  unlikely that the parties‘ interest will be sufficiently adverse to give rise to a case or \ncontroversy within the meaning of Article III.‖  Armstrong World Indus. v. Adams, 961 \nF.2d 405, 411–12 (3d Cir.1992).     \nIn this case, all of the Plaintiffs‘ claims are premised upon the assumption that \nthey will be imminently required to comply with the Mandate, a situation which, Plaintiffs \nsay, places them in an impossible trilemma by forcing them to either:  (a) subsidize, \nprovide and/or facilitate the coverage of abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services, in which case they will be violating \nsincerely held religious beliefs; (b) attempt to obtain exemption from the Mandate as \n―erligious employers,‖ in which case they will be violating different, but no less sincerely \nheld religious beliefs by abandoning service to non-Catholics; or (c) violate the terms of \nthe Mandate, in which case they will likely incur substantial fines and penalties.  \nHowever, Plaintiffs‘ assumption that they will be subjected to the Mandate in a \nmanner that violates their sincerely-held religious beliefs is, at most, a contingency \nwhich may well never to come to pass.  Under the ―sfae harbor‖ provisions established \nby current regulations, Plaintiffs are protected from any potential enforcement action \nrelative to the Mandate until at least January 1, 2014.  In addition, the Defendants have \nrepeatedly stated their intent to amend the Mandate, well before January 1, 2014, for \nthe express purpose of accommodating the Plaintiffs‘ religiously motivated objections to \nthe regulation.  Through their issuance of the March 21, 2012 ANPRM, Defendants \nhave in fact already initiated the amendment process.  See Certain Preventive Services \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Administrative Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(―ANPRM‖), 77 Fed. Reg. 16501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  Indeed, the Defendants have gone so \n24 \n \n\n \n  far as to plainly state that the Mandate in its current form will never be enforced against \nthe Plaintiffs and that they will publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relative to the \nMandate in the first quarter of 2013.9    \nBased on these representations from the Defendants, which we credit as good \nfaith statements of their true intent, we find that adversity of legal interests between the \nparties is lacking.  See Tait v. City of Philadelphia, 410 Fed. Appx. 506, 509 (3d Cir. \n2011) (―When a government body promises not to enforce a restriction against a \nplaintiff, or at all, there is no longer ‗a substantial threat of real harm‘ because \n‗intervening events [have] remove[d] the possibility of harm.‘‖) (alterations in the original) \n(citations omitted); Presbytery of N.J., 40 F.3d at 1470-71 (dismissing religious \nchallenge to discrimination law as unripe where State indicated, through official‘s \naffidavit, that churches would not be prosecuted for violations of the law); Salvation \nArmy v. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs, 919 F.2d 183, 192 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that a claim \nwas not ripe as to certain regulations when there was ―na express assurance that there \nwill be no enforcement‖ of those provisions). \nPlaintiffs insist that their current complaints do not rest upon uncertain future \nevents because the Mandate is currently the law, unless and until it is changed.  The \nonly uncertainty, Plaintiffs say, is whether the Government can alleviate the threat to \ntheir federal rights within a limited timeframe – i.e., prior to the expiration of the safe \n                                                      \n9 These facts distinguish the present case from Korte v. Sebelius, No. 12-3841 (7th Cir. Dec. 28, 2012) \nand Monaghan v. Sebelius, No. 12-15488 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 30, 2012), both of which were recently cited \nby Plaintiffs in support of their request for injunctive relief.  Because both Korte and Monaghan involved \nplaintiffs that were for-profit entities challenging the ACA‘s contraceptive mandate, the plaintiffs in those \ncases were not beneficiaries of the safe harbor period and additional rulemaking.  See 77 Fed. Reg. \n8725, 8728 (Feb. 15, 2012).  Accordingly, since the issue of ripeness was never joined in those cases, \ntheir reasoning does not inform our present analysis. \n25 \n \n\n \n  harbor period.  Ultimately, the viability of Plaintiffs‘ argument depends upon how we \nview the Government‘s professed commitment to engage in further amendment of the \nMandate and, in particular, whether we view the Government‘s assurances in this \nregard as something that renders the Mandate a mere contingency. \nPlaintiffs urge this Court to follow the approach taken by the District Court in \nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v. Sebelius, supra.  In that case, the district \ncourt found the plaintiffs‘ First Amendment and RFRA claims fit for judicial review based \non its conclusion that the Mandate, having been formally promulgated in the Federal \nRegister, is not merely a ―onn-final proposed policy,‖ but rather a ―final rule.‖  2012 WL \n6042864 at *21.  Consistent with this conclusion, the court viewed the Defendants‘ \nstated intent to engage in further rulemaking as too amorphous to support the \ndefendants‘ lack-of-ripeness argument.  See id. (―[A]lthough the Court will assume that \nthe consideration that the Departments will conduct pursuant to the ANPRM is real, not \nmerely theoretical, there is no way to tell where that will go; the ANPRM is not a \n‗concrete plan.‘  It is, in fact, only ‗directed at possibilities.‘‖).  Critically, the New York \ncourt considered it ―sltl ipossible,‖ notwithstanding the defendants‘ publication of the \nANPRM, ―taht the Coverage Mandate as it is currently structured will become effective \nat the expiration of the safe harbor.‖  Id. at *21. \n  The position taken by the New York court appears to be the minority view, \nhowever, and numerous other federal courts have interpreted the prospect of the \nMandate‘s enforcement as a mere contingency in light of the Government‘s stated plan \nfor further rulemaking as it relates to non-exempt religious organizations.  See Colorado \nChristian University v. Sebelius, 2013 WL 93188 at *5 (―In the instant case, Defendants \n26 \n \n\n \n  have not only committed to further amend the interim final rule but, in fact, have initiated \na rulemaking process to do so.  Interpreted in a pragmatic way, Defendants' actions \nrender tentative, as opposed to final, the regulation at issue and Defendants' position on \nthe issues raised by [plaintiff].‖); Catholic Diocese of Peoria v. Sebelius, 2013 WL 74240 \nat *5 (finding that the Government is in the process of amending the preventive service \nregulations and that this makes the regulations unfit for judicial review); University of \nNotre Dame v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6756332 at *3 (stating that, despite the Mandate‘s \nclaim to be a final regulation, ―eevnts following the regulation‘s adoption make clear that \nit isn‘t final,‖ and ―edfendants have taken prompt and concrete action – the safe harbor \nprovision – indicating that its rule is subject to reconsideration and modification‖); The \nCatholic Diocese of Biloxi, Inc. v.

Sebelius, 2012 WL 5932977 at *8-9 (finding, despite the fact that \nthe Mandate is ―celarly definitive‖ by virtue of having been promulgated, that the \ndefendants‘ stated intention of amending the regulation so as to address plaintiffs‘ \nreligious liberties concerns rendered the plaintiffs‘ claims unripe); Catholic Diocese of \nNashville v.

Circuit addressed the ripeness issue \nin the consolidated appeals of Wheaton College and Belmont Abbey College.  See \nWheaton College v. Sebelius, Nos. 12-5273  and 12-5291 (D.C. Cir.  Dec. 18, 2012).  \nAfter acknowledging the Departments‘ creation of a safe harbor period and their stated \nintent to engage in further amendment of the Mandate prior to the end of the safe \nharbor period (as set forth in the February 15, 2012 Final Rule and the March 21, 2012 \nANPRM), the Court of Appeals observed that the Government had, at oral argument, \ngone ―further.‖  Id. at p. 2.  ―Frsit,‖ the Court noted, the Government had ―erpresented to \nthe court that it would never enforce [the Mandate] in its current form against the \nappellants or those similarly situated as regards contraceptive services‖ and instead, a \n―diffreent rule‖ would be applied to them – a representation which the Court of Appeals \ninterpreted as a ―ibnding commitment.‖  Id.  Moreover, the Court noted, the Government \nhad ―erpresented that it would publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the new \nrule in the first quarter of 2013 and would issue a new Final Rule before August 2013.‖   \nId.  ―aBsed expressly upon the understanding that the government will not deviate from \n28 \n \n\n \n  its considered representations,‖ the Court of Appeals concluded that ―teh cases are not \nfit for review at this time because ‗[if] we do not decide [the merits of appellants‘ \nchallenge to the current rule] now, we may never need to.‘‖  Id. at 2 (alterations in the \noriginal) (quoting American Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 683 F.3d 382, 387 (D.C. Cir. \n2012)).10 \nIn their supplemental memorandum discussing the Wheaton and Belmont Abbey \nCollege appeal, Defendants essentially reiterate their promise that:  (1) ―teh regulations \nwill never be enforced in their present form against entities like the plaintiffs in those \ncases or plaintiffs here‖ and (2) the Defendants ―will finalize amendments to the \nregulations in an effort to accommodate religious organizations with religious objections \nto contraceptive coverage before the rolling expiration of the safe harbor begins in \nAugust 2013.‖  (Defs.‘ Resp. to Pls.‘ Notice of Suppl. Auth. [ECF No. 53] at p. 1.)  Based \non these representations, we, like the majority of other courts cited above, view the \nDefendants‘ promise to engage in further rulemaking as a good faith, binding \ncommitment which effectively renders the Mandate a ―onn-final‖ agency action, at least \ninsofar as it relates to religious organizations like the Plaintiffs.  See Belmont Abbey \nCollege, supra, at * 9 (collecting cases in support of the proposition that agencies are \npresumed to act in good faith).  See also Colorado Christian University, supra, at *7 \n(rejecting the argument, adopted in Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, that the \npreventative services coverage Mandate is ―final‖ for purposes of ripeness and \nexplaining that the Defendants have finalized the religious employer exemption but have \n                                                      \n10 The Court of Appeals went on to hold the appeals before it in abeyance (rather than dismiss them), \npending regular updates from the Government on the status of its ongoing rulemaking efforts.  Like the \ndistrict court in Colorado Christian University, 2013 WL 93188 at *8, we will adhere to the customary \npractice of dismissing this unripe case in its entirety, rather than holding it in abeyance. \n29 \n \n\n \n  never finalized the mandate itself).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs face no realistic scenario of \nimminent injury resulting from enforcement of the Mandate as it currently exists.   \nOnce the forthcoming amendments to the Mandate are finalized, and assuming \nPlaintiffs‘ concerns are not sufficiently ameliorated, they ―will have ample opportunity [ ] \nto bring [their] legal challenge at a time when harm is more imminent and more certain.‖  \nOhio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 734 (1998).  For present purposes, \nhowever, Plaintiffs‘ claims are not ripe for adjudication because they ―erst[ ] upon \n‗contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at \nall,‘‖ Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (citations omitted), and because \n―teh possibility that future consideration will actually occur before [implementation] is not \ntheoretical but real.‖  Ohio Forestry Ass'n, Inc., 523 U.S. at 735. \nPlaintiffs insist that, regardless of the form the Mandate may ultimately take in the \nfuture, they are suffering a litany of injuries right now from the existing regulatory \nscheme and the harm to them will continue until this Court resolves their claims.  For \nexample, Plaintiffs maintain that they have an immediate need to know their obligations \nrelative to the Mandate because they are presently assessing and negotiating their \nbudgets and health insurance plans, which must be finalized in advance of the next \nopen enrollment season beginning in November 2013.  Specifically, Plaintiffs are \nweighing the costs of compliance with the Mandate versus the cost of non-compliance.  \n(See Murphy Affidavit [ECF. No. 24-3] at ¶ 25.)  Plaintiffs also fear the loss of donations \nfrom local businesses should their commercial benefactors be fined at some point for \ntheir own non-compliance with the Mandate or should they feel that the Plaintiffs are not \nacting in accordance with Catholic doctrine.  Plaintiffs further contend that Catholic \n30 \n \n\n \n  Charities cannot finalize its plans to expand its social services programs in light of the \npotential fines to which Plaintiffs may be subjected.  In addition, Plaintiffs say that the \nanticipated rulemaking schedule does not afford them enough time to make any \nnecessary changes to their health plans, to adjust their budgets, and to litigate. \nAlthough the ripeness inquiry encompasses consideration of the hardship to the \nparties that would result from withholding judicial review, Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. \nat 152, it is also the case that ―m[]ere economic uncertainty affecting the plaintiff‘s \nplanning is not sufficient to support pre-mature review.‖  Wilmac Corp. v. Bowen, 811 \nF.2d 809, 813 (3d Cir. 1987).  Accord Tennessee Gas Pipline Co. v. FERC, 736 F.2d \n747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (plaintiff‘s ―planning insecurity‖ was insufficient to establish \nhardship); Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. EPA, 536 F.2d 156, 162 (7th Cir. 1976) (―calims of \nuncertainty in [plaintiff‘s] business and capital planning are not sufficient to warrant [ ] \nreview of an ongoing administrative process‖).   \nAccordingly, a number of courts have found the types of injuries alleged here to \nbe insufficient for purposes of satisfying the ripeness requirement in cases where non-\nexempt religious organizations were challenging the preventive services coverage \nmandate.  See, e.g., Colorado Christian University, supra, at *8 (plaintiff‘s ―presnet  \nplanning for future eventualities‖ did not establish hardship for purposes of ripeness \ninquiry where the planning stemmed from plaintiff‘s ―nogoing speculation that \nDefendants will fail to amend the [Mandate] in a satisfactory manner‖); University of \nNotre Dame, supra, at *4 (rejecting, in the context of standing, plaintiff‘s claim of injury \nstemming from plaintiff‘s professed need for time to prepare for compliance with the \nMandate or its replacement; court finding that injury flowed not from the Mandate but \n31 \n \n\n \n  from the brevity of the safe harbor period); Catholic Diocese of Nashville, supra, at *5 \n(―[T]he planning insecurity Plaintiffs advance with regard to what the preventive services \nregulations may or may not require of them does not suffice to show hardship.‖); Zubik, \nsupra, at *9 (stating that ―teh mere fact that a declaratory judgment would be useful to \nassist Plaintiffs in making their upcoming operational decisions is insufficient to \novercome the fact that no actual controversy yet exists between the parties‖); id. at *11 \n(in the context of standing, plaintiffs could not demonstrate injury in fact based on \nallegations that uncertainty from the Mandate was interfering with their need for lead \ntime to arrange their health care plans, their ability to enter into collective bargaining \nagreement negotiations, and their ability to set tuition rates and make teacher retention \ndecisions); Wheaton College, supra, at * 8 (costs stemming from plaintiff‘s ―dseire to \nprepare for contingencies‖ and the ―lpanning insecurity‖ which allegedly resulted from \nuncertainty as to what the preventive services regulations might require of the plaintiff \nwere insufficient to establish hardship for purposes of the ripeness inquiry) (quoting \nBelmont Abbey College, supra, at *14).   \nPlaintiffs also claim injury by virtue of the fact that the Diocese is being required \nby its Third Party Administrator to sign an agreement indemnifying the TPA against any \ncosts that may be incurred with respect to the TPA‘s obligations to comply with the \nMandate.  More specifically, the Diocese has instructed its TPA not to comply with the \nterms of the Mandate, and the TPA has asked the Diocese to agree to indemnify it for \nlosses it may incur in complying with the Diocese‘s instructions.  (See Murphy Affidavit, \nEx. B [ECF No. 24-3] at 16-17.)  According to Plaintiffs, the indemnity agreement \n32 \n \n\n \n  applies to broad categories of costs for potentially staggering amounts of money and \nmay expose the Diocese to significant liability.  \nThis potential liability, however, is completely dependent upon contingent events, \nnamely that:  (a) the amended form of the Mandate will fail to alleviate the Plaintiffs‘ \nreligious concerns and (b) will not be complied with by the Diocese‘s TPA, resulting in \n(c) third party claims for which the Diocese is ultimately liable.  Such contingencies are \ntoo speculative to support a finding of ripeness.  Moreover, to the extent the claimed \nharm is the Diocese‘s discomfort in having to decide whether or not to sign the \nindemnity agreement, this represents but another form of ―[m]ere economic uncertainty \naffecting the plaintiff‘s planning‖ which ―si not sufficient to support pre-mature review.‖  \nWilmac Corp., supra, at 813. \nPlaintiffs also claim a number of injuries stemming from the exemption pertaining \nto ―erligious employers.‖11  Unlike the contraceptive services mandate, the ―erligious \nemployer‖ exemption does not appear to be the subject of further rulemaking and may \ntherefore be considered a ―final‖ regulation insofar as it relates to (and apparently \nexcludes) religious organizations like the Plaintiffs.  Seizing on this distinction, Plaintiffs \nhave articulated a number of ways in which, they claim, they are harmed by the now \n                                                      \n11 To reiterate, the regulations allow for a ―religious employer‖ to be exempted from the Mandate, and \nthey define that term as ―an organization that meets all of the following criteria:  \n \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization.  \n \n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the organization.  \n \n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the organization.  \n \n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) and section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.‖ \n \nSee 45 C.F.R. § 147.130 (a)(1)(iv)(B) (effective Aug. 3, 2011). \n33 \n \n\n \n  ―infal‖ – and (in their view) unconstitutionally narrow – exemption applicable to religious \nemployers.   \nThey assert, for example, that the Diocese is being required to truthfully certify to \nits TPA whether or not it satisfies the regulatory definition of a ―erligious employer‖ for \npurposes of the exemption.  According to Plaintiffs, any certification in this regard may \nimpact the scope of Plaintiffs‘ current TPA services as well as attempts by the Diocese \nto later claim the exemption.  Because the Diocese does not feel it can truthfully state \nthat it ―rpimarily employs‖ or ―serves primarily‖ persons who share its ―erligious tenets,‖ \nPlaintiffs believe that the Diocese cannot presently claim ―erligious employer‖ status; \nhowever, they fear that failure to claim such status now may jeopardize the Diocese‘s \nability to claim the exemption at a later time.  Alternatively, they say, a failure by the \nDiocese to complete the exemption form as requested may jeopardize its relationship \nwith its TPA.  \nIn addition, Plaintiffs claim that they are being harmed in that the Diocese is \nunable to determine whether to participate in a particular scholarship program that \nwould require the imminent recruitment of students, both Catholic and non-Catholic.  \nPlaintiffs fear that, should the Diocese involve itself in the recruitment program now, it \nmay be precluded from claiming the religious employer exemption later, since many \nnon-Catholic students would benefit from the program.  \nIn a similar fashion, Plaintiffs state that they are in danger of losing federal grant \nmonies on account of the manner in which the religious employer exemption has been \nformulated.  Because the Plaintiffs‘ federal grants are conditioned upon a certification \nthat Plaintiffs do not discriminate on the basis of religion, Plaintiffs believe that they \n34 \n \n\n \n  would be in violation of this provision – and, thereby stand to lose substantial federal \nfunding – should they have to alter their practices in the future for the benefit of the \nreligious employer exemption.  \nAt bottom, all of these professed harms stemming from the allegedly \nunconstitutional definition of ―erligious employer‖ share a common premise:  the \nassumption that Plaintiffs‘ religious liberties can only be adequately accommodated by \nexempting them from the Mandate altogether rather than by altering the terms of the \nMandate itself.  However, that assumption is unwarranted given that the future form of \nthe Mandate is as yet unknown.  Indeed, this uncertainty precisely illustrates why the \npending dispute is unfit for review.  See Colorado Christian University, supra, at *8 \n(rejecting plaintiff‘s claims of hardship which stemmed from its ongoing speculation that \ndefendants will fail to amend the interim final rule in a satisfactory manner, especially in \nlight of defendants‘ stated intent to amend the rule so as to accommodate the plaintiff‘s \nreligious concerns); University of Notre Dame, supra, at *4 (noting that, while it is \npossible that the future form of the Mandate might cause the plaintiff to violate its \nCatholic beliefs, ―on one can say because that future rule hasn‘t been promulgated‖); \nWheaton College, supra, at *8 (―Wheaton‘s argument that various hypothetical \naccommodations are insufficient … only serves to underscore why this Court ought not \naddress the merits of Wheaton‘s claims until the preventive services regulations ‗have \ntaken on fixed and final shape so that [the Court] can see what legal issues it is \ndeciding.‘‖) (alteration in the original) (citation omitted); Belmont Abbey College, supra, \nat *13 (rejecting as ―sepculative‖ plaintiff‘s assumption that the proposed \naccommodation set forth in the ANPRM will necessarily be the final rule; noting that ―teh \n35 \n \n\n \n  contents of the final amendment have not yet been decided‖ and ―[ti ]would thus be \npremature to find that the amendment will not adequately address Plaintiff‘s concerns‖). \nFinally, since it appears that the definition of a ―erligious employer‖ (and therefore \nthe exemption to which it applies) will likely not change via the rulemaking process, \nPlaintiffs have attempted to frame their complaint partially as an attack on the definition \nof ―erligious employer‖ itself, which Plaintiffs claim is unconstitutionally narrow.  In this \nregard, Plaintiffs‘ counsel suggested at oral argument that the definition of ―erligious \nemployer‖ as set forth in the Defendants‘ February 2012 regulations could become an \ninsidious gateway for future regulation of Catholic affairs, since the Diocese and its \naffiliated religious organizations can never meet this narrow definition of a ―erligious \nemployer‖ without fundamentally altering their practices and violating core religious \nbeliefs. \nWe find unavailing this attempt by Plaintiffs to decouple their objections relative \nto the Mandate from their objections concerning the exemption for religious employers.  \nIn light of the manner in which the regulatory scheme has been constructed, the \nobjected-to definition of ―erligious employer‖ is expressly limited to the context of \nrequired preventive care and screenings for women – i.e., the contraceptive Mandate, \nand cannot reasonably be read as having application outside the context of that \nparticular regulation.  See 45 C.F.R. §147.130(a)(iv)(A) and (B).  The ANPRM \nbuttresses this conclusion by emphasizing that  \nthis religious exemption is intended solely for purposes of the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement pursuant to section 2713 of the PHS \nAct and the companion provisions of ERISA and the [Internal Revenue] \nCode.  Whether an employer is designated as ―erligious‖ for these \npurposes is not intended as a judgment about the mission, sincerity, or \n36 \n \n\n \n  commitment of the employer, and the use of such designation is limited to \ndefining the class that qualifies for this specific exemption.  The \ndesignation will not be applied with respect to any other provision of the \nPHS Act, ERISA, or the Code, nor is it intended to set a precedent for any \nother purpose. \n \nCertain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act (ANPRM), 77 Fed. Reg. at \n16502 (emphasis in the original). \n  Consequently, it makes no sense to adjudicate the meaning of the religious \nemployer exemption separate and apart from the Mandate itself, as the Mandate is the \nonly context in which that particular definition of ―erligious employer‖ can have meaning.  \nAdditionally, for the reasons discussed at length above, Plaintiffs‘ alleged harms relative \nto their exclusion from the ―erligious employer‖ exemption are all premised on the \nfundamental assumption that their religious liberties can only be adequately \naccommodated by exemption, as opposed to amendment of the Mandate itself.  That \nissue, however, is not one that is presently fit for judicial review. \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, this Court concludes that the interests of the \nparties are not sufficiently adverse at this juncture to support a finding of ripeness. \n2.  Conclusiveness of the Judgment \nThe conclusiveness prong of the ripeness inquiry addresses ―whether the parties' \nrights will be definitively decided by a declaratory judgment.‖  Step–Saver Data \nSystems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, 912 F.2d 643, 649 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1990).  ―f Ia \ndeclaratory judgment is based on a contingency, however, it fails to change the parties‘ \nlegal status, and becomes an exercise in futility.‖  Zubik, supra, at *9 (citing Step Saver, \n912 F.2d at 649).   \n37 \n \n\n \n  For the same reasons previously discussed in relation to the ―daversity of \ninterests‖ inquiry, I find that the second ripeness prong is also unsatisfied.  That is, no \njudgment can be entered by this Court that would definitively decide the rights of the \nparties because the final form which the challenged regulation will take is as yet \nundetermined.  Because the Defendants insist that the present form of the Mandate will \nnot be enforced against the Plaintiffs or other similar religious organizations, any \nadjudication by this Court concerning the Mandate, as it exists today, would represent a \nwaste of judicial resources.  See, e.g., Zubik, supra, at *9 (―In this lawsuit, even if \nPlaintiffs received the declaratory judgment they seek at this time, it would not affect \ntheir rights unless Defendants sought or threatened to bring an enforcement action \nagainst them.  Since this has not occurred, and cannot occur under current law before \nJanuary 2014, the issuance of a declaratory judgment would be futile.‖); Catholic \nDiocese of Nashville, supra, at *5 (finding that ―dajudicating Plaintiffs‘ claims now would \nundermine the interests of judicial economy as it would require the court to review the \n[Mandate] before it is amended and before it is to be enforced‖ and ―would deny the \ndefendants a full opportunity to consider Plaintiffs‘ objections and to modify the \nGovernment‘s positions‖).   \nMoreover, as Defendants point out, any attempt by this Court to adjudicate \npossible future amendments to the Mandate would be too speculative to yield \nmeaningful review.  It would also defeat one of the rationales of the ripeness doctrine – \nspecifically, ―t oprevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from \nentangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also \n38 \n \n\n \n  to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has \nbeen formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way.‖  Abbott Labs, 387 U.S. at 148-49. \nPlaintiffs contend that the relevant inquiry for present purposes is whether the \nissues in dispute are predominantly legal.  In Presbytery of New Jersey, our Court of \nAppeals observed that, for purposes of the conclusivity-of-judgment prong, the usual \nrequirement of a concrete set of facts ―hsa some play in the joints‖ and is not so \nimportant where ―teh question is ‗predominantly legal.‘‖  40 F.3d at 1463-64.  Here, \nPlaintiffs argue, the only potential missing ―fcat‖ is a possible change in the law which, \nthey insist, is legally insufficient to undermine the ripeness of their claims.  They \nconsider the current form of the Mandate to be a ―final‖ rule and contend that this Court \nshould not accept the Defendants‘ ―blithe ‗trust us—we‘ll fix it later‘ assertions that the \nANPRM will resolve all of Plaintiff‘s difficulties.‖  (Pls.‘ Mem. in Opp. to Defs.‘ Mot. to \nDismiss [24] at p. 30.)  They view the ANPRM‘s promise of future rulemaking as ―merely \na speculative potential future change.‖  (Id. at 30-31.) \nAs we have previously discussed, however, Plaintiffs‘ view – as espoused by the \ndistrict court in Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, is the minority view and one \nwith which we disagree.  The majority of courts which have entertained similar lawsuits \nby non-exempt religious entities have viewed the Mandate, in its present form, as a \n―nno-final,‖ tentative agency action in light of the rule-making process which is, even \nnow, unfolding.  See cases discussed, supra, at pp. 26-28.  Thus, the ―noly missing fact‖ \nat issue here – i.e., the question of what form the Mandate will ultimately take, is a \ncritical one which precludes meaningful, conclusive review. \n3.  Utility  \n39 \n \n\n \n  Finally, we consider the extent to which a declaratory judgment would be useful \nto the parties in this case.  Unlike the conclusivity inquiry, which addresses whether the \nparties‘ rights will be definitively decided by a declaratory judgment, the utility inquiry \naddresses whether the parties‘ plans of action will likely be affected by a declaratory \njudgment.  See Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc., 912 F.2d at 650 n.9.  As our circuit \ncourt of appeals has explained, ―[]one of the primary purposes behind the Declaratory \nJudgment Act was to enable plaintiffs to preserve the status quo before irreparable \ndamage was done,‖ and therefore, ―a csae should not be considered justiciable unless \n‗the court is convinced that [by its action] a useful purpose will be served.‘‖  Id. at 649 \n(second alteration in the original). \nIn their complaint, Plaintiffs seek an order vacating and/or enjoining the Mandate.  \nThey also seek a declaratory judgment stating that the Mandate violates their rights \nunder RFRA and the First Amendment as well as the provisions of the APA.  In other \nwords, Plaintiffs essentially seek an order that places them in the position they enjoyed \nprior to enactment of the ACA.   \nSuch an order, however, would have little utility in light of the fact that (1) the safe \nharbor period official precludes enforcement of the Mandate against the Plaintiffs until at \nleast January 2014; (2) Defendants have committed to finalizing an amended form of \nthe Mandate by August 2013; (3) Defendants have committed to publishing the new \nproposed amendment during the first quarter of 2013; and (4) Defendants have \nessentially guaranteed that the Mandate, in its current form will never be enforced \nagainst these Plaintiffs (or other similarly situated religious entities).  Under these \ncircumstances, the declaratory relief sought in the complaint would be redundant insofar \n40 \n \n\n \n  as it relates to the Mandate in its current form and would not preclude the Defendants \nfrom promulgating an amended form of the Mandate in any event.  See Colorado \nChristian University, 2013 WL 93118 at *7 (until the pending amendment to the interim \nfinal rule is completed, ‖the Court‘s review could encompass, at most, the current \namended interim final rule, which would be highly inefficient since it will be altered again \nsoon.‖); Zubik, 2012 WL 5932977 at *9 (holding that ― adeclaratory judgment would be \nof remarkably little utility at this stage‖ because, to the extent it would aid Plaintiffs‘ \noperational planning, ―hte mere fact that a declaratory judgment would be useful to \nassist Plaintiffs in making their upcoming operational decisions is insufficient to \novercome the fact that no actual controversy yet exists between the parties.‖). \nAccordingly, we find that declaratory relief in this case would provide little, if any, \nutility at this stage. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claims \nPlaintiffs claim that, even if their RFRA and First Amendment claims are not \npresently ripe for review, their APA claims are.  We disagree. \nSection 704 of the APA provides that a ―final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court [is] subject to judicial review.‖  5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nAlthough the APA does not, by its terms, explicitly define what qualifies as ―final‖ agency \naction, the ―core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking \nprocess, and whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the \nparties.‖  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992); see also Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (noting that agency action is final if:  (1) it marks \nthe consummation of the decisionmaking process – i.e., it must not be of a ―merely \n41 \n \n\n \n  tentative or interlocutory nature‖; and (2) rights are determined or legal consequences \nflow from the action).  Thus, ―a regulation is not ordinarily considered the type of agency \naction ‗rpie‘ for judicial review under the [APA] until the scope of the controversy has \nbeen reduced to more manageable proportions, and its factual components fleshed out, \nby some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation in a fashion \nthat harms or threatens to harm him.‖  Nat'l Park Hospitality Ass'n v. Dept. of the \nInterior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003) (citation omitted).  \nFor the reasons previously discussed at length herein, this Court concludes that \nthe Mandate, in its present form, cannot be considered a ―infal agency action‖ for \npurposes of review under the APA.12  Further, to the extent Plaintiffs seek review of the \n―erligious employer‖ exemption, their complaints cannot be segregated from \n                                                      \n12 On this point, we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the court in Zubik \nv. Sebelius, supra.  Noting that ―[]courts have been pragmatic when interpreting the finality element of \nripeness under the APA,‖ 2012 WL 5932977 at *13 (citations omitted), the Zubik court considered the \nfollowing ―finality factors‖:  (1) whether the decision represents the agency's definitive position on the \nquestion; (2) whether the decision has the status of law with the expectation of immediate compliance; (3) \nwhether the decision has immediate impact on the day-to-day operations of the party seeking review; (4) \nwhether the decision involves a pure question of law that does not require further factual development; \nand (5) whether immediate judicial review would speed enforcement of the relevant act.  See id. (citing \nSolar Turbines Inc. v. Seif, 879 F.2d 1073, 1080 (3d Cir. 1989)).  The court then found that: \n \neach of these factors weighs against a determination that Plaintiffs' claims are ripe.  First, \nwhile the regulations are ―final,‖ by virtue of having been formally promulgated, the \nregulations do not represent the Defendants' ―definitive position on the question‖ as \nDefendants have initiated a formal amendment process of these regulations.  Second, as \ndiscussed at length supra, at the current time there is no expectation of immediate \ncompliance by either Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Third, any decision the Court would make \ntoday would not have an immediate impact on Plaintiffs' day-to-day operations as the \nexisting regulations are currently under review and are expected to be modified. Next, any \ndecision clearly requires further factual development as the current controversy at this time \nis based on contingent facts.  Finally, immediate judicial review would not speed \nenforcement as Plaintiffs are not subject to any potential enforcement action before January \n2014, if at all. \n \n2012 WL 5932977 at *13. \n42 \n \n\n \n  consideration of the Mandate itself, and it cannot be said that they presently face any \nharm or threat of harm from that particular aspect of the regulation. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs‘ claims under the APA are \nnot ripe for adjudication at this time. \nC. Standing \nDefendants have made the alternative argument that this Court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction over the pending case based upon the Plaintiffs‘ alleged lack of \nstanding.  Because our conclusion as to lack of ripeness is dispositive, we need not \nconsider this alternative basis for dismissal.  See Colorado Christian University, 2013 \nWL 93188 at *9 (declining to address defendants‘ standing arguments where case was \nnot ripe for review); Catholic Diocese of Biloxi, supra, at *12 (same).  \n \nV.  CONCLUSION \nBased upon the foregoing reasons, this Court concludes that the within action is \nnot ripe for judicial review.  Because Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of \nestablishing subject matter jurisdiction, this matter will be dismissed in its entirety \nwithout prejudice.

This lawsuit is about an unprecedented attack by the Government on one of \nAmerica’s most cherished freedoms:  the freedom to practice one’s religion without government \ninterference.  It is not about whether people have a right to abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services.  It is about whether the Government may force \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 2 of 56\n \nPlaintiffs—all Catholic entities—to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate those services contrary to \ntheir firmly held religious beliefs.  American history and tradition, embodied in the First \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), \nprotect religious entities from such overbearing and oppressive governmental action.  Plaintiffs \ntherefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most fundamental of American rights. \n2.  Plaintiff, the Most Reverend Donald W. Trautman, is both Bishop and Trustee of \nPlaintiff The Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie (the “Diocese”), which is geographically, the \nlargest diocese in Pennsylvania.  The Diocese serves Catholic and non-Catholic residents of \nNorthwestern Pennsylvania in three main ways:  by educating children within the Diocese, by \npromoting spiritual growth, and by service to the community.  The Diocese carries out this work \nboth on its own and through the work of related organizations, including Plaintiffs St. Martin \nCenter, Inc. (“St. Martin Center”) and Prince of Peace Center, Inc. (“Prince of Peace Center”).   \n3.  Plaintiffs serve individuals in Northwestern Pennsylvania that the Government \ndoes not or cannot serve and who without Plaintiffs’ assistance would be without food, shelter, \nand other basic life-sustaining services.  \n4.  In every respect, Plaintiffs’ work is guided by and consistent with the teaching of \nthe Catholic Church, of which Plaintiffs are a constituent part.  Among these core teachings is \nthe Catholic tenet that life begins at conception and continues through natural death.  As is well \nknown, Catholic doctrine regards abortion, sterilization, and contraception as gravely contrary to \nthe moral law.   \n5.  Catholics also believe that, according to Christ’s command, devotion to God is \ndemonstrated through devotion to all people regardless of their faith or financial condition.  \nCatholic social teaching requires Catholic individuals and organizations to work to create a more \n  2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 3 of 56\n \njust community by striving to meet needs wherever they arise.  Plaintiffs meet needs in \nNorthwestern Pennsylvania through their respective ministries.   \n6.  The Diocese serves families in Northwestern Pennsylvania through the education \nof the students in its school system and by providing support to the charitable programs of \nCatholic Charities of the Diocese of Erie (“Catholic Charities”), including programs operated by \nPlaintiffs St. Martin Center and Prince of Peace Center.   \n7.  Plaintiffs serve all people, regardless of faith or financial condition.   \n8.  The Government is now attacking Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs in an unprecedented \nmanner—forcing Plaintiffs to choose between respecting the sanctity of all human life, on the \none hand, and fulfilling their religious mission to provide opportunities and charitable support to \nall people regardless of their faith, on the other.   \n9.  The Government, through “regulations” promulgated in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), has mandated that Plaintiffs provide health plans to their \nemployees which include coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and \nrelated counseling services that the Church holds to be intrinsically immoral.   \n10.  Defendants have promulgated various rules (collectively “the U.S. Government \nMandate”) that force Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs.  Under the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, many Catholic and other religious organizations are required to subsidize, \nprovide, and/or facilitate the coverage of abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and \nrelated counseling services in their employee health plans in violation of their sincerely-held \nreligious beliefs.  Ignoring broader religious exemptions from other federal laws, the \nGovernment has crafted a narrow exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate for certain \n“religious employers” who can convince the Government that they satisfy four criteria:  “(1) The \n  3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 4 of 56\n \ninculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization.  (2) The organization primarily \nemploys persons who share the religious tenets of the organization.  (3) The organization serves \nprimarily persons who share the religious tenets of the organization.  (4) The organization is a \nnonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”   \n11.  Thus, in order to safeguard their religious freedom, religious employers must \nplead with government bureaucrats for a determination that they are sufficiently “religious.” \n12.  The Diocese does not know whether the Department of Health and Human \nServices will conclude that it satisfies the U.S. Government Mandate’s narrow definition of \n“religious employer” under the impermissibly vague terms of the exemption.  In order for the \nDiocese to learn whether or not it qualifies for the exemption, it must submit to an intrusive \ngovernmental investigation into whether, in the view of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, its “purpose” is the “inculcation of religious values,” whether it “primarily” employs \nCatholics, and whether it “primarily” serves Catholics.  \n13.  The definition of “religious employer,” moreover, excludes St. Martin Center and \nPrince of Peace Center, even though they are “religious” organizations under any reasonable \ndefinition of the term.   \n14.  Consequently, to even attempt to qualify as a “religious employer,” these \nPlaintiffs may be required to stop serving non-Catholics, and fire non-Catholic employees —\nactions that would betray their religious commitment to serving all in need without regard to \nreligion and threaten to undermine the Church’s vaunted tradition of service to others.   \n15.  The only other choice available to Plaintiffs is to disobey the law, either by \nrefusing to provide the mandated services or dropping their health plans.  In so doing, Plaintiffs \n  4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 5 of 56\n \nmay well be subject to substantial fines and penalties, which would hamper the provision of \nimportant services and erode the funds that they use to carry out their educational and charitable \nmissions.   \n16.  The Government, therefore, has mandated that Plaintiffs either abandon their \nreligious beliefs or abandon their religious commitment to serve all.  The “options” imposed by \nthe U.S. Government Mandate are therefore no “options” at all.   \n17.  The regulations establishing the U.S. Government Mandate, including the narrow \nexemption, are existing law.  Nevertheless, the Government has expressed an intent to implement \na vaguely defined “accommodation” of certain religious organizations.  Under this proposed \naccommodation, if a non-exempt religious organization objects to offering coverage for the \nmandated services, the Government would require that organization’s insurance company (or \nanother, as yet undefined third party) to directly and “automatically” provide coverage for those \nservices to the organization’s employees “free of charge.”  \n18.  Regardless, however, the promise that a third-party insurer or administrator will \nprovide the illicit services “free of charge,” even if implemented, would do nothing to change the \nactual effect of the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n19.  Moreover, the accommodation is predicated on an accounting gimmick that \nwould not affect the actual operation of the regulations as applied to religious organizations.  The \nDiocese’s purchase of an insurance policy will result in the subsidy, provision, and/or facilitation \nof coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling \nservices, even if, as an accounting matter, the insurer or administrator putatively “pays” for those \nservices or provides them for “free.”   \n  5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 6 of 56\n \n20.  The Catholic Church’s two-thousand-year-old objections to abortion, sterilization, \nand contraception, however, cannot be solved through such sleight of hand.  Catholic teaching \ndoes not simply require Catholic institutions to avoid directly subsidizing practices that are \nviewed as intrinsically immoral.  It also requires them to avoid facilitating those practices.     \n21.  The U.S. Government Mandate forces Plaintiffs to take action subsidizing, \nproviding, and/or facilitating coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, \nand related counseling services in violation of their religious beliefs.   \n22.  This unprecedented, direct assault on the religious beliefs of Catholics is \nirreconcilable with American law.   \n23.  RFRA, the First Amendment, and the APA stand as bulwarks against such \narbitrary governmental action.   \n24.  RFRA and the First Amendment require the most compelling of interests to \nsustain such massive burdens on religion.  Even then, both require the Government to adopt the \nmost narrowly tailored means available to advancing that interest.  The APA, moreover, requires \nthat the Government use rational, lawful means for achieving any such goals in a transparent and \naccountable manner, and prohibits arbitrary means that target firmly held religious values simply \nbecause they are unpopular in certain quarters.  The U.S. Government Mandate, however, cannot \npossibly satisfy these stringent legal standards.   \n25.  Instead, the U.S. Government Mandate will hurt citizens in need, rob those \nministered to by Plaintiffs of vital educational, service, and employment opportunities, and \nunfairly target Catholic organizations like Plaintiffs because of their moral views with an \nintolerable demand that they abandon their beliefs.   \n  6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 7 of 56\n \n26.  An actual, justiciable controversy currently exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants.  Absent a declaration resolving this controversy and the validity of the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs are uncertain as to their rights and duties in planning, \nnegotiating, and implementing their group health insurance plans, their hiring and retention \nprograms, and their social, educational, and charitable programs and ministries, as described \nbelow. \n27.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an order vacating the U.S. Government Mandate and \ndeclaring that the U.S. Government Mandate cannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiffs.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against enforcement of the U.S. Government \nMandate. \nI.

This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343(a)(4), and 1346(a)(2). \n39.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nA.  Background on the Bishop and the Diocese \n40.  The Diocese of Erie encompasses thirteen counties in Northwestern Pennsylvania.  \nIt is led by Bishop Trautman, who has served as the Bishop of Erie for twenty-two years.  The \nDiocese carries out its Christ-centered mission in three mains ways:  by educating children \nwithin the Diocese, by promoting spiritual growth, and through community service.   \n41.  The Diocese operates thirty elementary schools, three middle schools, and seven \nsecondary schools, which educate over 7,500 students.  The Diocese educates students of all \n  8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 9 of 56\n \nreligions and offers tuition assistance for students who otherwise, would have no alternative to \nthe public school system.  This determination is based solely on financial need.  Many non-\nCatholic students attend the Diocesan grade schools, middle schools, and secondary schools.    \n42.  As for its role in promoting spiritual growth, the Diocese consists of 117 parishes \nserving a thirteen-county region, including a Catholic population of approximately 222,000 \npeople.  Geographically, it is the largest diocese in Pennsylvania.   \n43.  Bishop Trautman publishes FAITH Magazine of the Catholic Diocese of Erie, the \nlargest family publication in Northwestern Pennsylvania.  FAITH Magazine is mailed to \napproximately 62,000 households in all thirteen counties of Northwestern Pennsylvania and \nfocuses on religious issues, but also on other international, national, and local news.  “The \nmagazine is designed to touch the hearts of people both within and outside of the faith.”  About \nUs, FAITH Magazine, available at http://www.eriercd.org/faithabout.asp.    \n44.  In addition to providing spiritual care to its Catholic residents through its parishes \nand providing education to Catholic and non-Catholic students, the Diocese serves many more \nthousands of Northwestern Pennsylvania residents through its social service arms.   \n45.  Many non-Catholics are served by the Diocese’s post-abortion ministry, prison \nministry, family ministry, disability ministry, international Diocesan missions, various respect \nlife organizations, and the numerous secular and religious charities that receive the Diocese’s \nfinancial support, including: \na.  St. Elizabeth Center, a food pantry, thrift store, and clothing shop for low-\nincome individuals; \nb.  The Good Samaritan Center, a shelter for homeless men and provider of \nan emergency one-family apartment and other emergency assistance; \n  9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 10 of 56\n \nc.  Better Homes for Erie, a provider of affordable housing to low-income \nfamilies; and \nd.  Catholic Charities Counseling and Adoption Services, a provider of \nprofessional counseling, adoption counseling, pregnancy counseling, and \nrefugee resettlement services. \n46.  These social service programs, which receive support from the Diocese, provide \naid to approximately 56,000 people per year.  And again, all of these services are provided \nwithout regard to religion, race, or financial condition.  The provision of these social services is a \ncentral tenet of the Catholic faith.   \n47.  Many of the individuals being served through these charitable programs are not \nbeing adequately served by the Government and without the support of the Diocese, would be \nwithout food, shelter, and other necessary services.   \n48.  The Diocese would not be able to provide all of these social services without the \nfinancial contributions of its donors and the work of its numerous volunteers.  \n49.  In summary, the Diocese has well over 50 employees, but does not know exactly \nhow many of these employees are Catholic.  The Diocese operates 40 schools.  These schools \nserve over 7,500 students, many of whom are not Catholic.  The Diocese supports numerous \ncharitable missions, which serve over 56,000 persons who are homeless, elderly, or otherwise in \nneed of material assistance.  The Diocese serves all people in need, regardless of the faith of such \nindividuals, and therefore does not know how many of the people it serves are Catholic.  It is \ntherefore unclear whether the Diocese qualifies for an exemption from compliance with the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate offered to organizations deemed “religious employers” under the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate’s narrow exemption, discussed below. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 11 of 56\n \n50.  In order to determine how many of the individuals the Diocese employs and \nserves are Catholic, the Diocese would be required to ask the religious affiliation of all \nindividuals that it employs or serves.  That inquiry, however, would substantially burden the \nDiocese’s religious exercise.   \n51.  Moreover, the process by which the Government proposes to determine whether \nan organization—such as the Diocese—qualifies for the exemption, will require the Government \nto engage in an intrusive inquiry into whether, in the view of HHS, (1) the Diocese’s “purpose” \nis the “inculcation of religious values,” (2) whether the Diocese “primarily” employs Catholics, \nand (3) whether it “primarily” serves Catholics.  The standards are impermissibly vague and \nsubjective.  Regardless of outcome, the Diocese strongly objects to such an intrusive \ngovernmental investigation into its religious mission.   \n52.  Finally, the Diocese operates a self-insured health plan.  That is, the Diocese does \nnot contract with a separate insurance company that provides health care coverage to its \nemployees and the employees of its affiliated corporations.  Instead, the Diocese itself functions \nas the insurance company underwriting the medical costs of its employees and the employees of \nits affiliated corporations.   \n53.  The Diocesan health plans are administered by Third Party Administrators, which \nare paid a flat fee for each covered individual for administering the plans, but do not pay for any \nservices received by covered employees.   \n54.  The Diocesan health plan does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s definition of a \n“grandfathered” plan.  Indeed, the Diocese did not include a statement describing its \ngrandfathered status in plan materials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii) for \ngrandfathered plans.   \n  11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 12 of 56\n \n55.  Under the Diocesan health plan, each new plan year begins annually on July 1st. \nB.  Background on St. Martin Center, Inc. \n56.  Plaintiff St. Martin Center is a nonprofit, social service organization which has \nbeen providing individuals and families with resources to gain self-sufficiency for the last 50 \nyears.  Plaintiff provides the following services to the needy in the greater Erie, Pennsylvania \ncommunity, regardless of religion: \na.  Social services:  an in-house pantry; vouchers for clothing items; \nassistance for rent, mortgage, and utility payments; assistance for \nobtaining life-sustaining prescriptions; vouchers for bus passes and \ngasoline; and guidance for creating a budget.  Also, through St. Martin’s \nBishop’s Breakfast Program, the needy in the community receive a hot \nbreakfast every weekday.    \nb.  Housing services:  counseling for potential homebuyers; fair housing and \npredatory lending education; lead paint education; and foreclosure \nprevention counseling.  Also, through the HOME Investment Partnership \nProgram, first-time homebuyers can receive funds to bring a home into \ncompliance with building codes. \nc.  An Early Learning Center, which serves as a preschool and provider of \nbefore and after school care.  Childcare tuition assistance is available at \nthe Early Learning Center. \nd.  Hospitality Industry Training to teach workforce kitchen skills to the \nunderemployed, unemployed, and many resettled refugees.  St. Martin \n  12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 13 of 56\n \nCenter provides hands-on experience to such individuals through its \ncatering program, Catering on Parade; and \ne.  PA WORKWEAR, a provider of men’s clothing for interviewing and \nentering the workforce. \n57.  Many of the individuals being served through the programs of St. Martin Center \nare not being adequately served by the Government and without the support of these programs, \nwould be without food and other necessary services which enable them to live a self-sufficient \nlife.   \n58.  St. Martin Center would not be able to provide all of these social services without \nthe financial contributions of its donors and the work of its numerous volunteers.  \n59.  St. Martin Center has over 50 full-time employees, but does not know how many \nof these employees are Catholic.   \n60.  St. Martin Center employees are insured under the Diocesan health plan.   \n61.  In summary, St. Martin Center has over 50 employees, but does not know how \nmany of these employees are Catholic.  St. Martin Center serves all people in need, regardless of \nthe faith of such individuals, and therefore does not know how many of the people it serves are \nCatholic.   \nC.  Background on Prince of Peace Center, Inc.  \n62.  Plaintiff Prince of Peace Center is a nonprofit, social service organization which \nprovides various social and self-sufficiency services to the needy in the greater Mercer County  \ncommunity.  The services offered by Prince of Peace Center include:   \na.  Family support services through the HOPE Advocacy program (Help and \nOpportunity for Personal Empowerment) and Project RUTH (Resources, \nUnderstanding, Training, and Homes).  HOPE Advocacy is a long term \n  13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 14 of 56\n \nsupport program (for up to 24 months) for individuals and families \nstruggling with poverty.  Project RUTH is a transitional housing program \nfor single parents and their children, who meet the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development’s definition of homeless.  All of the \nindividuals served by HOPE Advocacy and Project RUTH are given the \nopportunity to learn basic life skills necessary for self-sufficiency and \nfamily stability through intensive case management and monthly support \ngroups.  The case managers work closely with all participants and offer \neducational, supportive, and advocacy services.   \nb.  Emergency Assistance programs, which provide food, clothing, furniture, \nappliances, and more to those in need at little to no cost.  Prince of Peace \nCenter’s Emergency Assistance programs are funded by private donations.  \nThrough such donations, Prince of Peace Center is able to offer over \n$50,000 yearly to help the needy pay utility bills and offer any other \nnecessary support to ensure that family units remain intact.  As part of its \nEmergency Assistance Program, Prince of Peace Center runs a program \nentitled AWESOME (Assistance With Education, Shelter, Organization, \nMoney management, and Employment).  The AWESOME program is \ngeared towards single men and women who have children and wish to \nattain self-sufficiency.  The AWESOME program classes cover a variety \nof topics, including proper nutrition, decision making, and financial \nplanning.  Anyone who attends the AWESOME program classes is \neligible for an emergency stipend towards payment of a utility bill.   \n  14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 15 of 56\n \nc.  Mission Thrift Store (“the Thrift Store”), which provides items such as \nclothing and furniture to the community at a low cost.  The Thrift Store \ndoes not turn away anyone in need and supplies items to such individuals \nat no cost.  The Thrift Store operates at a significant loss each year, but the \nmission of the store is to serve all in need, not to focus on sales or money.   \nd.  PA WORKWEAR, a program which provides the needy with clothing, \naccessories, and training to prepare for job interviews.  Those who \nsuccessfully obtain employment are entitled to receive five additional days \nof work appropriate attire so that they can continue to present a \nprofessional image at their job.  \ne.  Neighborhood Meal, a soup kitchen, which provides two meals per week \nto the needy.  The soup kitchen serves approximately 5,700 individuals \nper year.  The needy can come to the soup kitchen for Thanksgiving and \nChristmas dinner.  During the summer months, a health fair is held at the \nsoup kitchen to educate the needy about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.  \nAlso, Prince of Peace Center sponsors Food Day, a program where the \nneedy receive a monthly food distribution of groceries to supplement food \nstamps.  An average of approximately 700 individuals receive food \nthrough this program each month.   \nf.  Computer classes for adults and seniors.  Students who pass the class \nreceive a free donated and refurbished computer.   \ng.  Various programs and charity drives for disadvantaged children in the \nMercer County community are held throughout the year, including a \n  15 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 16 of 56\n \nChristmas toy drive, Easter egg hunt, and school supplies and school \nclothing drive.   \n63.  Prince of Peace Center does not inquire into the religious beliefs of the \nindividuals it serves, as part of its mission is to strengthen families, build community, and reduce \npoverty among people of all ages, faiths, races, and backgrounds.   \n64.  The majority of the individuals served by Prince of Peace Center are below the \npoverty level and are not being adequately served by the Government.  Without the services of \nPrince of Peace Center, these individuals would be without food and shelter.   \n65.  Prince of Peace Center would not be able to provide all of these social services \nwithout the financial contributions of its donors and the work of its numerous volunteers.  \n66.  Prince of Peace Center employees are insured under the Diocesan health plan. \n67.  Prince of Peace Center does not know how many of its employees are Catholic. \n68.  In summary, Prince of Peace Center does not know how many of its employees \nare Catholic and serves all people in need, regardless of the faith of such individuals.   \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ RELIGIOUS BELIEFS \n69.  None of the social service programs or schools described above are available only \nto Catholics.  To the contrary, the schools of the Diocese are open to children of every religion.  \nThe social service programs of St. Martin Center, Prince of Peace Center, and of other \norganizations which the Diocese supports do not ask the religion of the people they serve.  \nInstead, all of these schools and programs—like the Catholic Church that inspires the work of all \nPlaintiffs—are committed to serving anyone in need, regardless of religion. \n70.  Plaintiffs’ commitments to teach and to serve all are part of a larger belief system \nthat likewise proclaims Catholic teachings on the sanctity of human life and the dignity of all \npersons. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 17 of 56\n \n71.  Plaintiffs believe, in accordance with the Catechism of the Catholic Church, that \nthe “dignity of the human person is rooted in his creation in the image and likeness of God,” \nCatechism of the Catholic Church ¶ 1700, and that “[h]uman life must be respected and protected \nabsolutely from the moment of conception.”  Id. ¶ 2270.   \n72.  Likewise, Plaintiffs adhere to Catholic teachings on the nature and purpose of \nhuman sexuality.  Plaintiffs believe, in accordance with the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \nthat the sexual union of spouses “achieves the twofold end of marriage:  the good of the spouses \nthemselves and the transmission of life.  These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be \nseparated without altering the couple’s spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage \nand the future of the family.”  Id. ¶ 2363.   \n73.  Consequently, Plaintiffs believe that “every action,” including artificial \ncontraception and sterilization, “which . . . proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render \nprocreation impossible is intrinsically evil.”  Id. ¶ 2370.   \n74.  Plaintiffs believe that “direct abortion,” defined as “abortion willed as an end or \nas a means,” is “gravely contrary to the moral law.” Id. ¶¶ 2322, 2271.   \n75.  Plaintiffs adhere to Catholic teachings which regard direct sterilization as \n“unacceptable.”  ¶¶ 2370, 2399.  \n76.  The Diocese promulgates its beliefs that abortion, contraception, and sterilization \nare contrary to the moral law through its schools and programs run out of Diocesan headquarters.  \nTo support these beliefs, the Office of Education within the Diocese has an organization devoted \nsolely to Natural Family Planning and Chastity Education and Bishop Trautman has recognized \nthat natural family planning is consistent with Catholic doctrine.    \n  17 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 18 of 56\n \n77.  The ability of the Diocese to impress upon its parishioners, students, and engaged \ncouples its strong opposition—consistent with the strong opposition of the Catholic Church—to \nabortion, contraceptives, and sterilization would be seriously undermined if the Government \nsucceeded in forcing the Diocese to provide its employees and the employees of its affiliated \ncorporations with access to abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related \ncounseling services. \n78.  Plaintiffs have a duty, in accordance with Catholic social teachings, to promote \nthe health and well-being of their employees and families.   \n79.  To that end, Plaintiffs offer generous health insurance plans to their employees.  \nSignificantly, however, Plaintiffs have ensured that those plans do not include coverage for \nabortifacients, sterilization services, and related counseling services.   \n80.  Consistent with Church teachings, Plaintiffs’ employee health plans cover drugs \ncommonly used as contraceptives only when prescribed with the intent of treating another \nmedical condition, not with the intent of preventing pregnancy. \n81.  Plaintiffs cannot, without violating their sincerely-held religious beliefs, \nsubsidize, provide, and/or facilitate these or other devices, drugs, procedures, or services that are \ninconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church. \nIII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \n82.  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010) (collectively the “Affordable Care Act” or the “Act”).   \n83.  The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for “group health \nplans,” broadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plans” within the meaning of the Employee \n  18 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 19 of 56\n \nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care  \n. . . to employees or their dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).   \n84.  The Affordable Care Act requires an employer’s group health plan to cover \ncertain women’s “preventive care.”  Specifically, it indicates that “[a] group health plan and a \nhealth insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a \nminimum[,] provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for—(4) \nwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \npurposes of this paragraph.”  Pub. L. No. 111-148 § 1001(5), 124 Stat. 131 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4)).   \n85.  Because the Act prohibits “cost sharing requirements,” the health plan must pay \nfor the full costs of these “preventive care” services without any deductible or co-payment.   \n86.  Some provisions of the Affordable Care Act exempt individuals with religious \nobjections.  For example, individuals are exempt from the requirement to obtain health insurance \nif they are members of a “recognized religious sect or division” that conscientiously objects to \nacceptance of public or private insurance funds or are members of a “health care sharing \nministry.”  26 U.S.C. §§ 5000A(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii) (conscientious objectors); 5000A(d)(2)(b)(ii) \n(“health care sharing ministry”). \n87.  Not every employer is required to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate.  \n“Grandfathered” health plans are exempt from the “preventive care” mandate.  Interim Final \nRules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive \nServices Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,731 \n(July 19, 2010) (“Interim Final Rules”); 42 U.S.C. § 18011.  Such plans cannot undergo \n  19 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 20 of 56\n \nsubstantial change after March 23, 2010 without losing grandfathered status.  Id.  HHS estimates \nthat “98 million individuals will be enrolled in grandfathered group health plans in 2013.”  Id. at \n41,732. \n88.  Violations of the Affordable Care Act can subject an employer and an insurer to \nsubstantial monetary penalties. \n89.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain employers who fail to offer “full-time \nemployees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under \nan eligible employer-sponsored plan” will be exposed to significant annual fines of $2,000 per \nfull-time employee.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). \n90.  Additionally, under the Internal Revenue Code, group health plans that fail to \nprovide certain required coverage may be subject to an assessment of $100 a day per individual.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, Cong. Research Serv., \nRL 7-5700, Enforcement of the Preventive Health Care Services Requirements of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (2012) (asserting that this assessment applies to employers \nwho violate the “preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n91.  Under the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of HHS may impose a \nmonetary penalty of $100 a day per individual where an insurer fails to provide the coverage \nrequired by the U.S. Government Mandate.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(i); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 (asserting that this penalty applies to insurers who violate the \n“preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n92.  ERISA may provide for additional penalties.  Under ERISA, plan participants can \nbring civil actions against insurers for unpaid benefits.  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700.  Similarly, the Secretary of Labor may bring an enforcement \n  20 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 21 of 56\n \naction against group health plans of employers that violate the U.S. Government Mandate, as \nincorporated by ERISA.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(b)(3); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 \n(asserting that these penalties can apply to employers and insurers who violate the “preventive \ncare” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n93.  The Affordable Care Act limits the Government’s regulatory authority.  The Act \nand an accompanying Executive Order reflect a clear congressional intent to exclude all \nabortion-related services from the Act and the regulations implementing it.  The Act itself \nprovides that “nothing in this title (or any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to \nrequire a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of its \nessential health benefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  And the Act left it to \n“the issuer of a qualified health plan,” not the Government, “[to] determine whether or not the \nplan provides coverage of [abortion].”  Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n94.  Likewise, the Weldon Amendment, which has been included in every HHS and \nDepartment of Labor appropriations bill since 2004, prohibits an agency from using Government \nfunds to discriminate against an institution based on providing coverage for abortions.  \nSpecifically, “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act [to the Department of Labor and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services] may be made available to a Federal agency or \nprogram . . . if such agency, program, or government subjects any institutional or individual \nhealth care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay \nfor, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. \nL. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n95.  The intent to exclude abortions was instrumental in the Affordable Care Act’s \npassage, as cemented by an Executive Order without which the Act would not have passed.  \n  21 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 22 of 56\n \nIndeed, the Act’s legislative history could not show a clearer congressional intent to prohibit the \nexecutive branch from requiring group health plans to provide abortion-related services.  For \nexample, the House of Representatives originally passed a bill that included an amendment by \nCongressman Bart Stupak prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion services.  See H.R. \n3962, 111th Cong. § 265 (Nov. 7, 2009).  The Senate version, however, lacked that restriction.  \nS. Amend. No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (Dec. 23, 2009).  To avoid filibuster in the \nSenate, congressional proponents of the Act engaged in a procedure known as “budget \nreconciliation” that required the House to adopt the Senate version of the bill largely in its \nentirety.  Congressman Stupak and other pro-life House members indicated that they would \nrefuse to vote for the Senate version because it failed adequately to prohibit federal funding of \nabortion.  To appease these Representatives, President Obama issued an executive order \nproviding that no executive agency would authorize the federal funding of abortion services.  See \nExec. Order No. 13,535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).   \n96.  The Act was, therefore, passed on the central premise that all agencies would \nuphold and follow “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” and to prohibit federal \nfunding of abortion.  Id.   \nB.  The U.S. Government Mandate Was Promulgated Without Regard to Ordinary \n  Rules of Procedure \n97.  It took the Defendants in this case less than two years to subvert this central \npremise of the Act.  Over time, they issued interim rules and press releases—none of which \nfollowed notice-and-comment rulemaking—that required the federal funding of abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services and commandeered \nreligious organizations to facilitate those services as well.   \n  22 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 23 of 56\n \n98.  Within four months, on July 19, 2010, Defendants issued their initial interim final \nrules concerning § 300gg-13(a)(4)’s requirement that group health plans provide coverage for \nwomen’s “preventive care.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,726.   \n99.  Defendants improperly dispensed with notice-and-comment rulemaking for these \nrules.  Even though federal law had never required coverage of abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services, Defendants claimed both that the APA \ndid not apply to the relevant provisions of the Affordable Care Act and that “it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay putting the provisions in these interim \nfinal regulations in place until a full public notice-and-comment process was completed.”  Id. at \n41,730.     \n100.  The interim final rules did not resolve what services constitute “preventive care;” \ninstead, they merely track the Affordable Care Act’s statutory language.  They provide that “a \ngroup health plan . . . must provide coverage for all of the following items and services, and may \nnot impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible) with \nrespect to those items or services: . . . (iv) With respect to women, to the extent not described in \nparagraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided \nfor in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,759 (codified at 45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(iv)).   \n101.  The interim final rules, however, failed to identify the women’s “preventive care” \nthat Defendants planned to require employer group health plans to cover, nor did the interim \nfinal rules give any notice as to how Defendants would identify those services.  42 U.S.C.  \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4).  Instead, Defendants noted that “[t]he Department of HHS [was] developing \n  23 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 24 of 56\n \nthese guidelines and expects to issue them no later than August 1, 2011.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 \nFed. Reg. at 41,731. \n102.  Defendants permitted concerned entities to provide written comments about the \ninterim final rules.  See id. at 41,726.  But, as Defendants have conceded, they did not comply \nwith the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.  Id. at 41,730. \n103.  In response, several groups engaged in a lobbying effort to persuade Defendants \nto include various contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in the “preventive care” \nrequirements for group health plans.  See, e.g., Press Release, Planned Parenthood, Planned \nParenthood Supports Initial White House Regulations on Preventive Care (July 14, 2010), \navailable at http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-\nparenthood-supports-initial-white-house-regulations-preventive-care-highlights-need-new-\n33140.htm. \n104.  Other commentators noted that “preventive care” could not reasonably be \ninterpreted to include such practices.  These groups indicated that pregnancy was not a disease \nthat needed to be “prevented,” and that a contrary view would intrude on the firmly held beliefs \nof many religiously affiliated organizations by requiring them to pay for services that they \nviewed as intrinsically immoral.  See, e.g., Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, at \n1-2 (Sept. 17, 2010), available at http://old.usccb.org/ogc/preventive.pdf.   \n105.  On August 1, 2011, HHS issued the “preventive care” services that group health \nplans would be required to cover.  See Press Release, HHS, Affordable Care Act Ensures \nWomen Receive Preventive Services at No Additional Cost (Aug. 1, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html.  Again acting without notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking, HHS announced these guidelines through a press release rather than \n  24 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 25 of 56\n \nenactments in the Code of Federal Regulations or statements in the Federal Register.  The press \nrelease made clear that the guidelines were developed by a non-governmental “independent” \norganization, the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”).  See id.   \n106.  In developing the guidelines, IOM invited certain groups to make presentations on \npreventive care.  On information and belief, no groups that oppose government-mandated \ncoverage of abortion, contraception, and related education and counseling were among the \ninvited presenters.  Comm. on Preventive Servs. for Women, Inst. of Med., Clinical Preventive \nServices for Women app. B at 217-21 (2011), \nhttp://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13181&page=R1. \n107.  The IOM’s own report, in turn, included a dissent that suggested that the IOM’s \nrecommendations were made on an unduly short time frame dictated by political considerations, \nthrough a process that was largely subject to the preferences of the committee’s composition, and \nwithout the appropriate transparency for all concerned persons.  \n108.  In stark contrast with the central compromise necessary for the Affordable Care \nAct’s passage and President Obama’s promise to protect religious liberty, HHS’s guidelines \nrequired insurers and group health plans to cover  “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all \nwomen with reproductive capacity.”  See Health Res. Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, available at \nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/.   \n109.  Contraceptives approved by the FDA that qualify under these guidelines cause \nabortions.  For example, the FDA has approved “emergency contraceptives” such as the \nmorning-after pill (otherwise known as Plan B), which destroys the embryo by preventing it \n  25 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 26 of 56\n \nfrom implanting in the womb, and Ulipristal (otherwise known as HRP 2000 or Ella), which \nlikewise can induce abortions of living embryos. \n110.  A few days later, on August 3, 2011, Defendants issued amendments to the \ninterim final rules that they had previously enacted in July 2010.  See Group Health Plans and \nHealth Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011).   \n111.  Defendants issued the amendments again without notice-and-comment \nrulemaking on the same grounds (namely, that it would be “impracticable and contrary to the \npublic interest to delay” putting the rules into effect) that they had provided for bypassing the \nAPA with the original rules.  See id. at 46,624. \n112.  When announcing the amended regulations, Defendants ignored the view that \n“preventive care” should exclude abortifacients, sterilization services, and contraceptives that do \nnot prevent disease.  Instead, they noted only that “commenters [had] asserted that requiring \ngroup health plans sponsored by religious employers to cover contraceptive services that their \nfaith deems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious freedom.”  Id. at \n46,623.   \n113.  Defendants sought “to provide for a religious accommodation that respect[ed]” \nonly “the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial \npositions.”  Id.   \n114.  Specifically, the regulatory “religious employer” exemption ignored definitions of \n“religious employer” already existing in federal law and, instead covered only those employers \nwhose purpose is to inculcate religious values, and who employ and serve primarily individuals  \n \n  26 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 27 of 56\n \nof the same religion.  It provides in full: \n(A)  In developing the binding health plan coverage guidelines specified in this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iv), the Health Resources and Services Administration \nshall be informed by evidence and may establish exemptions from such \nguidelines with respect to group health plans established or maintained by \nreligious employers and health insurance coverage provided in connection \nwith group health plans established or maintained by religious employers \nwith respect to any requirement to cover contraceptive services under such \nguidelines. \n \n(B)  For purposes of this subsection, a “religious employer” is an organization \nthat meets all of the following criteria: \n(1)  The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the \norganization. \n(2)  The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious \ntenets of the organization. \n(3)  The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious \ntenets of the organization. \n(4)  The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section \n6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n \nId. at 46,626 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(A)-(B)).   \n115.  The regulation delegates to a branch within Defendant HHS the job of issuing \nexemptions on an ad hoc and subjective basis by allowing that branch to determine which \norganizations meet this definition of “religious employer.”   \n116.  The religious employer exemption also mandates an unconstitutionally invasive \ninquiry into an organization’s religious purpose, beliefs, and practices. \n117.  Similarly, the religious employer exemption further mandates an impermissibly \ninvasive inquiry into the religious beliefs of the individuals an organization employs and serves.   \n118.  The religious employer exemption also uses impermissibly vague, undefined \nterms that extend that Agency’s already broad discretion and fail to provide organizations with \nnotice of their duties and obligations.  There is no definition for the vague terms “inculcation of \nreligious values,” “purpose of the organization,” “primarily,” and “religious tenets.”  Similarly, \n  27 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 28 of 56\n \nthere is no indication of whether an entity with multiple purposes can determine whether it \nqualifies and how much overlap there must be for religious tenets to be “share[d].”   \n119.  When issuing this interim final rule, Defendants did not explain why they issued \nsuch a narrow religious exemption.  Nor did Defendants explain why they refused to incorporate \nother “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” that President Obama’s executive order \npreviously had promised to respect.  See Exec. Order No. 13,535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, \n2010).   \n120.  ERISA, for example, has long excluded “church plans” from its requirements, \nmore broadly defined to cover civil law corporations, including entities like St. Martin Center \nand Prince of Peace Center, that share religious bonds with a church.  See 29 U.S.C. \n§§ 1002(33)(C)(iv), 1003.   \n121.  Nor did Defendants consider whether they had a compelling interest to require \nreligiously affiliated employers to include services in their health plans that they viewed as \nimmoral, or whether Defendants could achieve their views of sound policy in a more religiously \naccommodating manner. \n122.  Suggesting that they were open to good-faith discussion, Defendants once again \npermitted parties to provide comments to the amended rules.  Numerous organizations expressed \nthe same concerns that they had before, noting that abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services could not be viewed as “preventive care.”  They \nalso explained that the religious exemption was “narrower than any conscience clause ever \nenacted in federal law, and narrower than the vast majority of religious exemptions from state \ncontraceptive mandates.”  Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops at 1-2 (Aug. 31, \n  28 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 29 of 56\n \n2011), available at http://www.usccb.org/about/general-counsel/rulemaking/upload/comments-\nto-hhs-on-preventive-services-2011-08.pdf.   \n123.  The Diocese published an article in its October 17, 2011 Life Issues Forum \nentitled “Standing Together for Conscience Rights,” which asked parishioners to stand with the \nBishops in support of religious freedom.    \n124.  Defendant Sebelius spoke at a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America.  \nNARAL Pro-Choice America is a pro-abortion organization that opposes many Catholic \nteachings.  She told the pro-abortion audience that “we are in a war,” apparently with opponents \nof either federal funding of abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related \ncounseling services or federal mandates requiring coverage of abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services in health care plans.  \n125.  In January 2012, allegedly “[a]fter evaluating [the new] comments” to the interim \nfinal rules, Defendants gave their response.  They did not request further discussion or attempts \nat compromise.  Nor did they explain the basis for their decision.  Instead, Defendant Sebelius \nissued a short, Friday-afternoon press release.  See Press Release, HHS, A Statement by U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (Jan. 20, 2012), \navailable at http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html.   \n126.  The press release announced, with little analysis or reasoning, that HHS opted to \nkeep the religious employer exemption unchanged, but indicated that “[n]onprofit employers \nwho, based on religious beliefs, do not currently provide contraceptive coverage in their \ninsurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until August 1, 2013, to comply with the new \nlaw.”  Id.   \n  29 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 30 of 56\n \n127.  Taken together, these various rules and press releases amount to a mandate that \nrequires most religiously affiliated organizations to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage \nfor abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services through \nthe health plans that they offer employees.  As noted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the release \neffectively gave objecting religious institutions “a year to figure out how to violate [their] \nconsciences.”   \nC.  The White House Has Refused to Expand the Exemption \n128.  On February 10, 2012, given the continued public outcry to the U.S. Government \nMandate and its exceedingly narrow conscience protections, the White House held a press \nconference and issued another press release about the U.S. Government Mandate announcing \nthat it had unilaterally come up with a “solution” to their religious objections.   \n129.  According to the White House, Defendants will issue regulations at some \nunspecified date prior to August 1, 2013 to exempt religious organizations that have moral \nobjections to subsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating coverage for abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services from directly paying for those services \nunder the terms of their health plans.   \n130.  When such religious organizations provide health plans to their employees, the \n“insurance company will be required to directly offer . . . contraceptive care free of charge.”  \nWhite House, Fact Sheet: Women’s Preventive Services and Religious Institutions  \n(Feb. 10, 2012), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-\nwomen-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutions.   \n131.  Despite continued objections that this “accommodation” did nothing of substance \nto protect the right of conscience, when asked if there would be further room for compromise, \nWhite House Chief of Staff Jacob Lew responded:  “No, this is our plan.”  David Eldridge & \n  30 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 31 of 56\n \nCheryl Wetzstein, White House Says Contraception Compromise Will Stand, The Washington \nTimes, Feb. 12, 2012, available at http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/12/white-\nhouse-birth-control-compromise-will-stand/print/.   \n132.  Defendants have since finalized, “without change,” the interim rules containing \nthe religious employer exemption, 77 Fed. Reg. at 8,729 (Feb. 15, 2012), and issued guidelines \nregarding the previously announced “temporary enforcement safe harbor” for “non-exempted, \nnon-profit religious organizations with religious objections to such coverage.”  Id. at 8,725; see \nCtr. for Consumer Info. & Ins. Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor \n(Feb. 10, 2012), available at http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-\nPreventive-Services-Bulletin.pdf. \n133.  On March 16, 2012, Defendants issued an Advance Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking (“ANPRM”) seeking comment on various ways to structure the proposed \naccommodation.  Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).   \n134.  The ANPRM launches a 90-day comment period, to be followed by several other \nsteps in the rulemaking process; it offers no clear end date other than repeating the assurance that \nan accommodation will be in place by August 1, 2013.  See id.    \n135.  The recurring theme is that the Government has not found a solution to the \nproblems it created when it promulgated its U.S. Government Mandate.   \n136.  In fact, the ANPRM contains little more than a recitation of proposals, \nhypotheticals, and “possible approaches.”  It offers almost no analysis of the relative merits of \nthe various proposals.  It is, in essence, an exercise in public brainstorming.   \n  31 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 32 of 56\n \n137.  This “regulate first, think later” approach is not an acceptable method of \nrulemaking when the Government is regulating in a way that may require monumental changes \nof the regulated entities.  \n138.  The ANPRM does not alter existing law.  It merely states an intention to do so at \nsome point in the future.  But a promise to change the law, whether issued by the White House or \nin the form of an ANPRM does not, in fact, change the law.   \n139.  Nor does the ANPRM alter the scope of the narrow religious employer \nexemption.   \n140.  The ANPRM does nothing of substance to avoid involving Plaintiffs in the \nsubsidy, provision, and/or facilitation of coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services or otherwise eliminate the constitutional infirmity \nof the U.S. Government Mandate. \n141.  Health plans do not take shape overnight.  Many analyses, negotiations, and \ndecisions must occur each year before Plaintiffs can implement health plans for their employees. \n142.  For example, an employer that is self-insured—like the Diocese— must work \nwith actuaries to evaluate its funding reserves and then must negotiate with its third-party \nadministrator (“TPA”).  \n143.  Under normal circumstances, Plaintiffs must begin the process of determining \ntheir health care package for a plan year at least one year before the plan year begins. The \nmultiple levels of uncertainty swirling around the U.S. Government Mandate and the ANPRM \nmake the already lengthy process of preparing a health benefits package even more complex. \n144.  The U.S. Government Mandate, however, may require Plaintiffs to make \nsignificant, and revolutionary changes, to their employee health coverage.  Plaintiffs, moreover, \n  32 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 33 of 56\n \nmay need to restructure their programs and health plans to fit within the U.S. Government \nMandate’s requirements.  Such changes will require substantially more lead time. \n145.  Plaintiffs are already being affected by the U.S. Government Mandate in that they \nhave expended resources learning about the U.S. Government Mandate, including the religious \nemployer exemption and safe harbor, and how these provisions affect Plaintiffs.   \n146.  Plaintiffs are currently, and for the foreseeable future will be, negotiating new and \nexisting employee contracts that will be in force when the U.S. Government Mandate begins \napplying to Plaintiffs’ health insurance plans.  The fact that Plaintiffs are unsure of the status of \ntheir health insurance plans may impact employee recruitment efforts, which may in turn harm \nPlaintiffs’ educational and social service functions.   \n147.  Additionally, Plaintiffs’ funding will likely be significantly impacted by the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate in that donors expect that Catholic organizations will act in accordance \nwith Catholic doctrine in all manners.   \n148.  Also, individuals who volunteer their time in support of the social service \nprograms run by Plaintiffs may stop offering their volunteer services since volunteers expect that \nCatholic organizations will act in accordance with Catholic doctrine in all manners.  As Plaintiffs \nrely on volunteers to help support their charitable programs, this could significantly impact the \nservices they are able to offer to the community.   \n149.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus imposes a present and ongoing hardship on \nPlaintiffs. \n \n \n \n  33 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 34 of 56\n \nIV.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE, THE PROPOSED ACCOMMODATION, \nAND THE RELIGIOUS EMPLOYER EXEMPTION VIOLATE PLAINTIFFS’ \nRELIGIOUS BELIEFS \nA.  The U.S. Government Mandate Puts Plaintiffs in the Unconscionable Position of \n  Having to Choose Between Complying with the Law or Abiding by their \n  Religious Beliefs \n150.  Since the founding of this country, one of the basic freedoms central to our \nsociety and legal system is that individuals and institutions are entitled to freedom of conscience \nand religious practice.  See, e.g., James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious \nAssessments, ¶ 1 (1785).   \n151.  The U.S. Government Mandate puts Plaintiffs—all Catholic employers—in an \nintolerable and unconscionable position.  It forces Plaintiffs to choose between their religious \nbeliefs (that abortion, sterilization, and contraception are immoral and strictly forbidden), their \nmission (educating, servicing, and employing individuals of all faith traditions to enrich and \nenlighten), and obeying the law.   \n152.  The U.S. Government Mandate directly conflicts with Plaintiffs’ sincere belief \nthat strictly forbids, as intrinsically immoral, the subsidy, provision, and/or facilitation of \ncoverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services \nthat the U.S. Government Mandate forces upon them.  Plaintiffs cannot, consistent with their \nCatholic identity, subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate such practices.  \n153.  In order to fall within the exemption, Plaintiffs would have to primarily serve \nCatholics, which would violate their religious beliefs.  For Catholics, love of God is \ndemonstrated through service to others; the two are so closely related and dependent upon each \nother that they cannot be separated.  Catholic doctrine recognizes that, “[l]iving faith ‘work[s] \nthrough charity.’”  Catechism of the Catholic Church ¶ 1814.  Plaintiffs cannot be forced to give \n  34 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 35 of 56\n \nup their devotion to all mankind without violating their religious beliefs and compromising their \nreligious purpose.   \n154.  The U.S. Government Mandate also seeks to compel Plaintiffs to fund “patient \neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  It therefore compels \nPlaintiffs to provide, subsidize, and/or facilitate speech that is contrary to their firmly held \nreligious beliefs.  \n155.  Although the Government exempts some religious institutions from the \nrequirement of subsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating the objectionable services, it has crafted \nsuch a narrow exception that thousands of sincere religious institutions and countless religious \nindividuals are being forced to make this unconscionable “choice.”  \n156.  Indeed, the Government does not provide Plaintiffs the option of attempting to \navoid the U.S. Government Mandate by exiting the health care market.  Eliminating its employee \ngroup health plan would expose each Plaintiff to substantial fines.   \n157.  It is no “choice” to leave those employees scrambling for health insurance while \nsubjecting Plaintiffs to significant fines for breaking the law.  Yet that is what the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate requires for Plaintiffs to adhere to their religious beliefs.  The Government \nhas no compelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs by \nrequiring them to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate access to abortifacients, sterilization \nservices, contraceptives, and related counseling services.   \n158.  The Government itself has relieved numerous other employers from this \nrequirement by exempting grandfathered plans and plans of employers it deems to be sufficiently \nreligious.  Moreover, these services are widely available in the United States.  The U.S. Supreme \n  35 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 36 of 56\n \nCourt has held that individuals have a constitutional right to use such services.  And nothing that \nPlaintiffs do inhibits any individual from exercising that right.   \n159.  Furthermore, the U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to promoting \na compelling governmental interest.  Even assuming the interest was compelling, the \nGovernment has numerous alternatives to furthering that interest other than forcing Plaintiffs to \nviolate their religious beliefs.   \n160.  For example, the Government could provide or pay for the objectionable services \nthrough expansion of its existing network of family planning clinics funded by HHS under Title \nX or through other programs established by a duly enacted law.  Or, at a minimum, it could \ncreate a broader exemption for religious employers, such as those found in numerous state laws \nthroughout the country and in other federal laws.   \n161.  The Government therefore cannot possibly demonstrate that requiring Plaintiffs to \nviolate their consciences is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. \n162.  The U.S. Government Mandate compels Plaintiffs to consider restructuring their \nadmissions, employment, and service programs to discriminate on the basis of religion in an \novert and potentially illegal fashion.   \n163.  The Diocese would be forced to inquire both into the nature and sincerity of the \nfaith of prospective students, turning away Protestants, Muslims, Jews, atheists, and those that \nthe Government may not find to be sufficiently Catholic—or at the very least, imposing strict \nquotas that ensure that they do not “primarily” serve such students.   \n164.  Financial aid programs designed to reach poor and underprivileged students \nregardless of religion would have to be similarly redesigned to exclude non-Catholics. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 37 of 56\n \n165.  Meanwhile, Plaintiffs would potentially subject themselves to a host of \nemployment discrimination suits if they restricted employment to coreligionists.   \n166.  Moreover, any attempts by Plaintiffs to qualify for the narrow religious exemption \nby restricting their charitable and educational mission to Catholics would have devastating \neffects on the communities encompassed within the Diocese’s borders.   \n167.  Several of the public school systems located within the Diocese’s boundaries are \nnot strong, and few non-Catholic private schools are available.  Forcing the non-Catholic \nstudents attending the Diocese’s grade schools and high schools to leave the Catholic school \nsystem would deprive these students and their parents of a safe, positive, structured, and \nacademically rigorous education in an area where there are very few comparable alternatives. \n168.  Many non-Catholics are also served by the Diocese’s post-abortion ministry and \nthe numerous secular and religious charities that receive the Diocese’s financial support, \nincluding:  Plaintiff St. Martin Center, Plaintiff Prince of Peace Center, a prison ministry, a \nhomeless shelter and low-income housing program, soup kitchens, food pantries, an HIV/AIDS \nsupport group and four emergency assistance centers, counseling and adoption services at eleven \nsites, and refugee resettlement.   \n169.  The vacuum left in Northwestern Pennsylvania by Plaintiffs’ inability to serve \nnon-Catholics would be impossible to fill. \n170.  In order to restrict the provision of services to Catholics, Plaintiffs would have to \ninquire about the religious beliefs and membership of any person who approached them or the \nprograms which Plaintiffs support.  Verifying the religious status of every poor, hungry, \ndisabled, or otherwise underserved person asking for assistance from Plaintiffs would clearly \npresent a logistical problem of significant proportions—and would seriously hamstring \n  37 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 38 of 56\n \nPlaintiffs’ ability to serve even those persons who were ultimately able to prove their \nmembership in the Catholic Church. \n171.  Despite the efforts of the Government to divide religious institutions by targeting \nspecific religious beliefs, Christian leaders in Pennsylvania, including all of the Catholic Bishops \nof Pennsylvania as members of the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, have jointly recognized \nthat the U.S. Government Mandate infringes on religious liberty and threatens all Christian \ninstitutions, no matter what the beliefs of the religious institution are as to abortion, sterilization, \nand contraception.  In a joint letter from the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference dated March 7, \n2012 and signed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop for Philadelphia, the Roman Catholic \nBishops for Erie, Pittsburgh, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Allentown, Altoona-Johnstown, and \nScranton, as well as the Metropolitan Archbishop for Ukrainians in the USA and the \nAdministrator of the Byzantine Catholic Archdiocese of Pittsburgh, the Christian leaders stated:  \nSome falsely suggest that the HHS mandate is about contraception.  This is \nprimarily about religious liberty and our First Amendment rights to the free \nexercise of our religion.  Make no mistake about it – this government mandate \nis a step which will inevitably lead to other mandates that continue to strike at the \nheart of our Faith and the constitutional liberties we have been guaranteed.   \nB.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Aggravates the \n  Constitutional and Statutory Violations \n172.  The religious employer exemption destroys religious freedom by exempting only \ninstitutions that primarily employ and serve “persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization.”  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)(2)-(3).  This is inconsistent with the definition of \nreligion under the Constitution and RFRA, and directly contradicts the Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held \nreligious beliefs of serving all people, regardless of whether or not they share the same faith.   \n173.  Both the Constitution and RFRA protect religious institutions, whether or not \ntheir purpose is the “inculcation of religious values,” and whether or not they “primarily” serve \n  38 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 39 of 56\n \nand employ co-religionists.  However, only institutions with such a narrow purpose qualify for \nthe religious exemption under the U.S. Government Mandate.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)(1).  \nThe Constitution and RFRA cannot abide such a feigned attempt at preserving religious rights.   \n174.  The Government also has not provided any process by which the Diocese can \ndetermine whether it fits within the exemption.   \n175.  It is unclear whether the Diocese qualifies for the exemption. \n176.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret religious “purpose.”  \n177.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret vague terms, such as \n“primarily,” “share,” and “religious tenets.”  \n178.  It is unclear how the Government will ascertain the “religious tenets” of an entity, \nthose it employs, and those it serves. \n179.  It is unclear how much overlap the Government will require for religious tenets to \nbe “share[d].” \n180.  Though the Government’s position is unclear, it appears that if an entity qualifies \nas a “religious employer” for purposes of the exemption, any affiliated corporation that provides \ncoverage to its employees through the exempt entity’s group health plan would also receive the \nbenefit of the exemption.  Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. \nReg. at 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012).   \n181.  If the Diocese qualifies as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, St. Martin Center and Prince of Peace Center thus also appear to receive \nthe benefit of the exemption. \n \n \n  39 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 40 of 56\n \nC.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Excessively \n  Entangles the Government With Religion, Interferes With Religious Institutions’ \n  Religious Doctrine, and Discriminates Against and Among Religions \n182.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s exemption further entangles the Government in \ndefining the religious tenets of each organization and its employees and beneficiaries.  The \nGovernment would have to decide Plaintiffs’ “religious tenets,” determine whether “the purpose” \nof the organization is to “inculcate” those tenets, and then conduct an inquiry into the practices \nand beliefs of the individuals that Plaintiffs ultimately employ and educate. \n183.  Indeed, President Obama all but conceded that the current state of the law fails to \nprotect Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion when, on February 10, 2012, he announced that his \nAdministration intended to implement new regulations that “accommodate[] religious liberty.”  \nWhite House, Fact Sheet.  But promises to change the law do not actually do so.  \n184.  Nor would the few opaque statements publicly made about the proposed \n“accommodation” relieve Plaintiffs from the unconscionable  position in which the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate currently puts them.   \n185.  Plaintiffs object to being forced to provide plans which subsidize, provide, and/or \nfacilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling \nservices they view as immoral even if Plaintiffs do not have to directly pay for such services.   \n186.  Basing the definition of religion on the Government’s assessment of the “purity” \nof an institution’s religious purpose and limiting that purpose to inculcation, at the expense of \nother sincerely-held religious purposes, the U.S. Government Mandate usurps religious \nautonomy, injecting the Government into deciding what is and is not a valid religious purpose.  \nThe Government cannot make such determinations.   \n187.  Under the U.S. Government Mandate’s logic, the Diocese’s programs in math, \nscience, and the arts could be subject to cancellation if they were deemed by a government \n  40 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 41 of 56\n \nadministrator to be insufficiently “religious” or to lack sufficient religious “purpose.”  \nRegardless of outcome, this inquiry is unconstitutional, and the Diocese strongly objects to such \nan intrusive governmental investigation into its religious mission.   \n188.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s narrow, ungrounded exemption discriminates \nagainst Catholic religious institutions as well as among religions.   \n189.  The U.S. Government Mandate targets Plaintiffs precisely because of their \ncommitment to educate, serve, and employ all without regard to religion.   \n190.  As a result of such discrimination, the U.S. Government Mandate is subject to the \nstrictest scrutiny under the Constitution. \nD.  The U.S. Government Mandate is Not a Neutral Law of General Applicability \n191.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability.   \n192.  It offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health \nplans subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services.  For example, the U.S. Government Mandate \nexempts all “grandfathered” plans from its requirements until the plans lose that status.   \n193.  It was, moreover, implemented by and at the behest of individuals and \norganizations who disagree with certain religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception, \nand thus targets certain religious organizations and certain religions for disfavored treatment.  \n194.  The Government has crafted a religious exemption to the U.S. Government \nMandate that favors certain religions over others.  As noted, it applies only to plans sponsored by \nreligious organizations that have, as their  “purpose,” the “inculcation of religious values”; that \n“primarily” serve individuals that share their “religious tenets”; and that “primarily” employ such \nindividuals.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B)(1).   \n  41 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 42 of 56\n \n195.  This narrow exemption may protect some religious organizations.  But it does not \nprotect the many Catholic and other religious organizations that educate students of all faiths, \nprovide vital social services to individuals of all faiths, and employ individuals of all faiths.  The \nU.S. Government Mandate thus discriminates against such religious organizations because of \ntheir religious commitment to educate, serve, and employ people of all faiths. \n196.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, was promulgated by Government \nofficials, and supported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose Catholic \nteachings and beliefs regarding marriage and family.   \n197.  For example, Defendant Sebelius has long been a staunch supporter of abortion \nrights and a vocal critic of Catholic teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception.  \n198.  On October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke at a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-\nChoice America.  At that fundraiser, Defendant Sebelius criticized individuals and entities whose \nbeliefs differed from those held by her and the other attendees of the NARAL Pro-Choice \nAmerica fundraiser, stating:  “Wouldn’t you think that people who want to reduce the number of \nabortions would champion the cause of widely available, widely affordable contraceptive \nservices?  Not so much.”   \n199.  Consequently, on information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the purpose of the \nU.S. Government Mandate, including the narrow exemption, is to discriminate against religious \ninstitutions and organizations that oppose abortion and contraception.  \n \n \n \n \n  42 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 43 of 56\n \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise  \nin Violation of RFRA \n200.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n201.  RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s exercise \nof religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the Government \ndemonstrates that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that interest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb. \n202.  RFRA protects organizations as well as individuals from Government-imposed \nsubstantial burdens on religious exercise. \n203.  RFRA applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law by any  \nbranch, department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States. \n204.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs.  \n205.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into their \nreligious beliefs.  \n206.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n207.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n208.  Requiring Plaintiffs to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate is not the least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  \n  43 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 44 of 56\n \n209.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate against \nPlaintiffs, Defendants have violated RFRA.  \n210.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n211.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT II \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n212.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n213.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government from \nsubstantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion. \n214.  The Free Exercise Clause protects organizations as well as individuals from \nGovernment-imposed burdens on religious exercise. \n215.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs. \n216.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into their \nreligious beliefs.   \n217.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n218.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it is riddled with exemptions.  It offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that \nemployer-based health plans subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services. \n  44 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 45 of 56\n \n219.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it discriminates against certain religious viewpoints and targets certain religious \norganizations for disfavored treatment.  Defendant enacted the U.S. Government Mandate \ndespite being aware of the substantial burden it would place on Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.  \n220.  The U.S. Government Mandate implicates constitutional rights in addition to the \nright to free exercise of religion, including, for example, the rights to free speech and to freedom \nfrom excessive government entanglement with religion.  \n221.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n222.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n223.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate, the \nGovernment has burdened Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise Clause \nof the First Amendment.  \n224.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n225.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT III \nExcessive Entanglement in Violation of the  \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n \n226.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n227.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nprohibit intrusive government inquiries into the religious beliefs of individuals and institutions, \nand other forms of excessive entanglement between religion and Government.  \n  45 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 46 of 56\n \n228.  This prohibition on excessive entanglement protects organizations as well as \nindividuals. \n229.  In order to qualify for the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate for \n“religious employers,” entities must submit to an invasive government investigation into an \nentity’s religious beliefs, including whether the entity’s “purpose” is  the “inculcation of \nreligious values” and whether the entity “primarily employs” and “primarily serves” individuals \nwho share the entity’s religious tenets. \n230.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus requires the Government to engage in \ninvasive inquiries and judgments regarding questions of religious belief or practice. \n231.  The U.S. Government Mandate results in an excessive entanglement between \nreligion and Government.  \n232.  The U.S. Government Mandate is therefore unconstitutional and invalid.  \n233.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  \n234.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n235.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT IV \nReligious Discrimination in Violation of the Free Exercise and  \nEstablishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n \n236.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n237.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nmandate the equal treatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or \npreference. \n  46 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 47 of 56\n \n238.  This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n239.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s narrow exemption for “religious employers” but \nnot others discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious status.  \n240.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer likewise \ndiscriminates among different types of religious entities based on the nature of those entities’ \nreligious beliefs or practices. \n241.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer furthers no \ncompelling governmental interest. \n242.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer is not narrowly \ntailored to further a compelling governmental interest.  \n243.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  \n244.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n245.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT V \nInterference in Matters of Internal Church Governance in Violation of the Free Exercise and \nEstablishment Clauses of the First Amendment  \n246.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n247.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause protect the freedom of \nreligious organizations to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernance as well as those of faith and doctrine.    \n248.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, or \ndoctrine.   \n  47 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 48 of 56\n \n249.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n250.  Plaintiffs are religious organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.   \n251.  The Catholic Church views abortion, sterilization, and contraception as \nintrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from subsidizing, providing, and/or \nfacilitating those practices.     \n252.  Plaintiffs have abided and must continue to abide by the decision of the Catholic \nChurch on these issues.     \n253.  The Government may not interfere with, or otherwise question the final decision \nof the Catholic Church that its religious organizations must abide by these views.  \n254.  Plaintiffs have therefore made the internal decision that the health plans they offer \nto their employees may not subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, \nsterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services. \n255.  The U.S. Government Mandate interferes with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \nconcerning their structure and mission by requiring them to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate \npractices that directly conflict with Catholic beliefs. \n256.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s interference with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \naffects their faith and mission by requiring them to subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate practices \nthat directly conflict with their religious beliefs.     \n257.  Because the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with the internal decision \nmaking of Plaintiffs in a manner that affects Plaintiffs’ faith and mission, it violates the \nEstablishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n  48 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 49 of 56\n \n258.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n259.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VI \nCompelled Speech in Violation of  \nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \n260.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n261.  The First Amendment protects against the compelled affirmation of any religious \nor ideological proposition that the speaker finds unacceptable. \n262.  The First Amendment protects organizations as well as individuals against \ncompelled speech. \n263.  Expenditures are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. \n264.  The First Amendment protects against the use of a speaker’s money to support a \nviewpoint that conflicts with the speaker’s religious beliefs. \n265.  Plaintiffs consistently hold and publicly proclaim that abortion, sterilization, and \ncontraception violate fundamental tenets of their Catholic religion. \n266.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to provide or sponsor \nhealth care plans to their employees that subsidize, provide, and/or facilitate coverage for \npractices that violate their religious beliefs.   \n267.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to subsidize, provide, \nand/or facilitate coverage for education and counseling services regarding these practices. \n268.  By imposing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants are compelling Plaintiffs \nto publicly subsidize and/or facilitate the activity and speech of private entities that are contrary \nto their religious beliefs. \n  49 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 50 of 56\n \n269.  The U.S. Government Mandate is viewpoint-discriminatory and subject to strict \nscrutiny. \n270.  The U.S. Government Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n271.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n272.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n273.  The U.S. Government Mandate imposes an immediate and ongoing harm on \nPlaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VII \nFailure to Conduct Notice-And-Comment Rulemaking and Improper  \nDelegation in Violation of the APA \n274.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n275.  The Affordable Care Act expressly delegates to an agency within Defendant \nHHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the authority to establish guidelines \nconcerning the “preventive care” that a group health plan and health insurance issuer must \nprovide.   \n276.  Given this express delegation, Defendants were required to engage in formal \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law before issuing the guidelines that \ngroup health plans and insurers must cover.  Proposed regulations were required to be published \nin the Federal Register and interested persons were required to be given an opportunity to \nparticipate in the rulemaking through the submission of written data, views, or arguments. \n277.  Defendants promulgated the “preventive care” guidelines without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law.    \n278.  Defendants, instead, wholly delegated their responsibilities for issuing preventive \ncare guidelines to a non-governmental entity, the IOM.   \n  50 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 51 of 56\n \n279.  The IOM did not permit or provide for the broad public comment otherwise \nrequired under the APA concerning the guidelines that it would recommend.  The dissent to the \nIOM report noted both that the IOM conducted its review in an unacceptably short time frame, \nand that the review process lacked transparency.         \n280.  Within two weeks of the IOM issuing its guidelines, Defendant HHS issued a \npress release announcing that the IOM’s guidelines were required under the Affordable Care Act.  \n281.  Defendants have never explained why they failed to enact these “preventive care” \nguidelines through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA. \n282.  Defendants also failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when issuing \nthe interim final rules and the final rule incorporating the guidelines.   \n283.  Defendants’ stated reasons for promulgating these rules without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking do not constitute “good cause.”  Providing public notice \nand an opportunity for comment was not impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest for the reasons claimed by Defendants. \n284.  Defendants have since undertaken a prolonged notice-and-comment process to \npromulgate amended regulations, which undermines their claim that good cause warranted \nabandoning notice-and-comment for the current regulations. \n285.  By enacting the “preventive care” guidelines and interim and final rules through \ndelegation to a non-governmental entity and without engaging in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, Defendants failed to observe a procedure required by law and thus violated 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D).   \n286.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.  \n  51 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 52 of 56\n \n287.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n288.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate without observance of a \nprocedure required by law and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing \nharm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT VIII \nArbitrary and Capricious Action in Violation of the APA \n289.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n290.  The APA condemns agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n291.  The APA requires that an agency examine the relevant data and articulate an \nexplanation for its action that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the \npolicy choice made. \n292.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious under the APA if the agency has failed \nto consider an important aspect of the problem before it. \n293.  A court reviewing agency action may not supply a reasoned basis that the agency \nitself has failed to offer. \n294.  Defendants failed to consider the suggestion of many commentators that \nabortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services could not be \nviewed as “preventive care.”   \n295.  Defendants failed adequately to engage with voluminous comments suggesting \nthat the scope of the religious exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate should be broadened. \n296.  Defendants did not articulate a reasoned basis for their action by drawing a \nconnection between facts found and the policy decisions it made. \n  52 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 53 of 56\n \n297.  Defendants failed to consider the use of broader religious exemptions in many \nother federal laws and regulations. \n298.  Defendants’ promulgation of the U.S. Government Mandate violates the APA. \n299.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.  \n300.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n301.  The U.S. Government Mandate imposes an immediate and ongoing harm on \nPlaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT IX \nActing Illegally In Violation of the APA \n302.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n303.  The APA requires that all Government agency action, findings, and conclusions \nbe “in accordance with law.”   \n304.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its exemption are illegal and therefore in \nviolation of the APA.   \n305.  The Weldon Amendment states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be \nmade available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n306.  The Affordable Care Act states that “nothing in this title (or any amendment by \nthis title) shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] \n  53 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 54 of 56\n \nservices . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. § \n18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  It adds that “the issuer of a qualified health plan shall determine whether or \nnot the plan provides coverage of [abortion.]”   Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n307.  The Affordable Care Act contains no clear expression of an affirmative intention \nof Congress that employers with religiously motivated objections to the provision and/or \nfacilitation of health plans that include coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, \ncontraceptives, and related counseling services should be required to provide such plans. \n308.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires employer based-health plans to subsidize, \nprovide, and/or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, sterilization services, contraceptives, and \nrelated counseling services.  It does not permit employers or issuers to determine whether the \nplan covers abortion, as the Act requires.  By issuing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants \nhave exceeded their authority, and ignored the direction of Congress. \n309.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates RFRA. \n310.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment. \n311.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not in accordance with law and thus violates \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n312.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available remedy, or, in the alternative, any effort \nto obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.  \n313.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n314.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate that is not in accordance with \nlaw and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \n \n  54 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00123-SPB   Document 1   Filed 05/21/12   Page 55 of 56\n \nVI.
