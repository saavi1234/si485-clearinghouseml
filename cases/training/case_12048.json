Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, seek to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs. </p><p>On February 8, 2013, the court (Judge John W. Darrah) granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing and ripeness. The court noted that the Federal Government had indicated in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) its intention to amend the regulation. And while these amendments did not eliminate the possibility of imminent injury to the Plaintiffs, it did impact the likelihood of injury such that it was not \"certainly impending.\" The court also held that the Plaintiffs inability to plan for the future based on the uncertain law did not impact their daily business.</p>",

This lawsuit is about one of America’s most cherished freedoms: the freedom to \npractice one’s religion without government interference.  It is not about whether people have a \nright to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception.  Those services are freely \navailable in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them \nmore widely available.  Here, however, the Government seeks to require Plaintiffs—all Catholic \nentities—to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs by providing, paying for, and/or \nfacilitating access to those services.  American history and tradition, embodied in the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n(“RFRA”), safeguard religious entities from such overbearing and oppressive governmental \naction.  Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most fundamental of American \nrights. \n2.  Plaintiffs are Catholic religious entities that provide a wide range of spiritual, \neducational, and social services to residents throughout Illinois, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.  \nFor example, Plaintiff Diocese of Joliet is a community of Roman Catholic parishes, schools, \nand outreach organizations, guided by Bishop R. Daniel Conlon, that not only provides pastoral \ncare and spiritual guidance for over 655,000 Catholics in Will, Grundy, DuPage, Kendall, \nKankakee, Ford, and Iroquois counties, but also serves individuals without regard to their \nreligion through its schools and multiple charitable programs.  The Diocese of Joliet carries out \nits mission both on its own and through the work of its affiliated corporations, including Plaintiff \nCatholic Charities Diocese of Joliet, Inc. (“Catholic Charities Joliet”).  Plaintiff Diocese of \nSpringfield-in-Illinois (“Diocese of Springfield”), is a community of Roman Catholic parishes, \nschools, and outreach organizations, guided by Bishop Thomas John Paprocki, that administers \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 3 of 63 PageID #:230\n \nto some 142,847 Catholics in 28 counties in Central Illinois and serves individuals without \nregard to their religion through its schools and charitable programs.  The Diocese of Springfield \ncarries out its mission both on its own and through the work of its affiliated corporations, \nincluding Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Springfield-in-Illinois (“Catholic \nCharities Springfield”).  Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago (“Catholic \nCharities Chicago”) is the social service arm of the Archdiocese of Chicago.  Established in \n1861, Plaintiff Saint Patrick High School is the oldest all-male Catholic high school in Chicago.  \n3.  Plaintiffs’ work is in every respect guided by and consistent with Roman Catholic \nbelief, including the requirement to serve those in need, regardless of their religion.  This is \nperhaps best captured by words attributed to St. Francis of Assisi: “Preach the Gospel at all \ntimes.  Use words if necessary.”  As Pope Benedict has more recently put it, “Love for widows \nand orphans, prisoners, and the sick and needy of every kind, is as essential to [the Catholic \nChurch] as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the Gospel.  The Church cannot \nneglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word.”  \nPope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est ¶ 22 (2006).  Or as Cardinal James Hickey, former \nArchbishop of Washington, once commented on the role of Catholic educators:  “We do not \neducate our students because they are Catholic; we educate them because we are Catholic.”  \nThus, Catholic individuals and organizations consistently work to create a more just community \nby serving any and all neighbors in need.    \n4.  Catholic Church teachings also uphold the firm conviction that sexual union should \nbe reserved to married couples who are so committed to one another that they are open to the \ncreation of life; thus, artificial interference with the creation of life, including through abortion, \nsterilization, and contraceptives, is contrary to Catholic doctrine. \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 4 of 63 PageID #:231\n \n5.  Defendants have promulgated various rules (collectively, “the U.S. Government \nMandate”) that force Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.  Under the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, many Catholic and other religious organizations are required to provide \nhealth plans to their employees that include and/or facilitate coverage for abortion-inducing \ndrugs, sterilization, and contraception, in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \nIgnoring broader religious exemptions from other federal laws, the Government has crafted a \nnarrow exemption to this Mandate for certain “religious employers” who can convince the \nGovernment that they satisfy four criteria:  \n●  “The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization”; \n \n●  “The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization”; \n \n●  “The organization primarily serves persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization”; and \n \n●     “The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) and \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”   \n \nThus, in order to safeguard their religious freedoms, religious employers must plead with \ngovernment bureaucrats for a determination that they are sufficiently “religious.” \n6.  Plaintiffs Diocese of Joliet and Diocese of Springfield do not know whether the \nGovernment will conclude that they satisfy the definition of a “religious employer” under the \nimpermissibly vague terms of the exemption.  And in order to find out, they must submit to an \nintrusive governmental investigation into whether, in the Government’s view, the Dioceses’ \n“purpose” is the “inculcation of religious values”; whether they “primarily” employ “persons \nwho share [their] religious tenets,” even though they hire employees of all faiths; and whether \nthey “primarily” serve  such people, even though their schools, parishes, and social services are \nopen to all. \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 5 of 63 PageID #:232\n \n7.  The definition of “religious employer,” moreover, excludes Catholic Charities \nJoliet, Catholic Charities Springfield, Catholic Charities Chicago, and Saint Patrick High School \neven though they are “religious” organizations under any reasonable definition of the term.  \nConsequently, to even attempt to qualify as “religious employer[s],” these Plaintiffs may be \nrequired to stop providing educational opportunities to non-Catholics, stop serving non-\nCatholics, and fire non-Catholic employees—actions that would betray their religious \ncommitment to serving all in need without regard to religion and undermine the Church’s \nvaunted tradition of service to others.  Such a definition means that before extending services, \nCatholic organizations would have to stop saying, “Are you hungry?”  and say instead,  “Are \nyou Catholic?” \n8.  The U.S. Government Mandate, including the exemption for certain “religious \nemployers,” is irreconcilable with the First Amendment, RFRA, and other laws.  The \nGovernment has not shown any compelling need to force Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate access to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception, or for requiring \nPlaintiffs to submit to an intrusive governmental examination of their religious missions.  The \nGovernment also has not shown that the U.S. Government Mandate is narrowly tailored to \nadvancing any interest in increasing access to these services, since these services are already \nwidely available and nothing prevents the Government from making them even more widely \navailable by providing or paying for them directly through a duly-enacted law.  The \nGovernment, therefore, cannot justify its decision to force Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate access to these services in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 6 of 63 PageID #:233\n \n9.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the U.S. Government Mandate \ncannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiffs, an injunction barring its enforcement, and an order \nvacating the Mandate. \nI.

Diocese of Joliet \n27.  The Diocese of Joliet encompasses over 120 parishes serving over 655,000 \nCatholics in Will, Grundy, DuPage, Kendall, Kankakee, Ford, and Iroquois counties.  The \nDiocese is a trust, created in 1949.  The Diocese’s parishes and most of its 62 high and \nelementary schools are part of the trust.  The charitable work of the Diocese is also performed \nthrough a number of separate, affiliated corporations, including (among others) Catholic \nCharities Diocese of Joliet, Inc. \n28.  Bishop R. Daniel Conlon, formerly the Bishop of the Diocese of Steubenville, has \nled the Diocese of Joliet since July, 2011.  Bishop Conlon is assisted in his ministry by an \nauxiliary bishop and by a staff of clergymen, religious brothers and sisters, and lay people.  The \nDiocese of Joliet has nearly 2,000 full-time, benefits-eligible employees that work in its parishes, \nschools, and Diocesan offices.  The Diocese does not know how many of its employees are \nCatholic. \n29.  The Diocese of Joliet carries out a tripartite spiritual, educational, and social \nservice mission, reflecting the several dimensions of its ministry.  The spiritual ministry of the \nDiocese is conducted largely through its parishes: through the ministry of its priests, the Diocese \nensures the regular availability of the sacraments to all Catholics living in or visiting Will, \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 9 of 63 PageID #:236\n \nGrundy, DuPage, Kendall, Kankakee, Ford, and Iroquois counties.  It also provides numerous \nother opportunities for prayer, worship, and faith formation.  In 2011, approximately 60,000 \nadults received formation in the Catholic faith through parish-level and Diocesan classes, \nlectures, and retreats.  And, roughly 65,000 children received faith formation in the Diocese’s \nreligious education programs and Catholic schools.  Approximately 1,000 adults enter the \nCatholic Church each year through programs offered by the parishes of the Diocese, and, in \n2011, there were 7,541 infant baptisms and 200 child baptisms.  In addition to overseeing the \nsacramental life of its parishes, the Diocese coordinates Catholic campus ministries at three \nuniversities within its borders. \n30.  The Diocese of Joliet conducts its educational mission through its schools.  When \nthe Diocese was officially erected in 1948, there were already a number of schools within the \nDiocese, with the earliest school established in 1853.  The Diocese operates 57 Catholic schools \nlocated within the Diocese—two high schools, 48 elementary schools, and seven pre-schools—\nserving over 21,600 students, and employing approximately 1,570 teachers and other school \nstaff.  Five additional Catholic schools are independent from, but located within, the Diocese and \nfall under the spiritual jurisdiction of Bishop Conlon.   \n31.  The Diocesan schools welcome students in all financial conditions, from all \nbackgrounds, and of any or no faith.  In order to make a Catholic education available to as many \nchildren as possible, the Diocese of Joliet expends substantial funds in tuition assistance \nprograms; it awarded over $1.3 million in tuition assistance in 2011-2012 to the high and \nelementary schools through its Catholic Education Foundation.  Just over 12 percent of the \nstudents in the Diocesan elementary schools and over 12 percent in the high schools are \nminorities. \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 10 of 63 PageID #:237\n \n32.  The Catholic educational system has demonstrated a particular dedication to \nteaching the underserved.  Schools like Holy Family Catholic School in Bensenville continue to \nexemplify the Catholic church’s dedication to teaching minority and non-Catholic youth.  Holy \nFamily, a Catholic elementary school committed to helping students grow spiritually, \nacademically, socially, and physically, currently serves 188 students, 51 percent of whom are \nHispanic.  Schools like Holy Family are no less an expression and outgrowth of genuine \nCatholic belief because of the demographics of those they serve.  Indeed, quite the opposite: the \nDiocese sees these schools as a vital part of its mission to offer to every student, in every place, a \nsafe, morally sound, and academically rigorous education. \n33.  The Diocese of Joliet’s schools offer a unique educational experience.  As Bishop \nConlon has said about Catholic education, “[T]he Catholic school functions as a unique \ncommunity of faith and love, serving both as an extension of the nuclear family and a \nlocalization of the larger Church.  There may be alternatives to Catholic schools.  There is no \nsubstitute.”  To that end, the Diocesan schools have established three priorities that make them \nstand out from other educational institutions.  Students are taught faith—not just the basics of \nChristianity, but how to have a relationship with God that will remain with them after they leave \ntheir Catholic schools.  Service, the giving of one’s time and effort to help others, is taught as \nboth a requirement of true faith and good citizenship.  Finally, high academic standards help \neach student reach his or her potential.  In the Diocese of Joliet, in 2011, the average student \nscored at or above the 75th mean national percentile in reading and language, and at or above the \n71st mean national percentile for math.   Three of the Diocese of Joliet’s schools have won the \nU.S. Department of Education’s Blue Ribbon Schools Award, and one of these schools is a two-\ntime recipient.  Nationally, over 99 percent of students in Catholic high schools graduate.   \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 11 of 63 PageID #:238\n \n34.  The success of the Diocese’s approach to education is demonstrated by St. \nMichael’s School in Wheaton, where students have performed very well on the Iowa Tests of \nBasic Skills standardized tests, even within the context of a top performing Diocese.  These \nscores place the school in the top 2 percent of schools in the nation.   \n35.  Much of the social service work of the Diocese of Joliet is performed through its \nparishes.  The parishes comprising the Diocese maintain their own charitable efforts, serving the \nneeds of their communities with programs including employment and job training, adopt-a-\nfamily programs at Christmas, meals served to the homeless, and visits to nursing homes.  The \nDiocese oversees all of the social service work undertaken by its parishes.  Neither the Diocese \nnor its parishes keeps a tally of persons served through these outreach programs, nor do they \nrequest to know the religious affiliation of those served. \n36.  In summary, the Diocese—and the entire Catholic church—is committed to \nserving anyone in need, regardless of religion. \n37.  In addition to serving individuals of all faiths, the Diocese also employs \nindividuals of all faiths. \n38.  The Diocese does not know how many of those it hires or serves are Catholic.  In \norder to determine those statistics, the Diocese would be required to ask the religious affiliation \nof all individuals that it employs or serves.  That inquiry, however, would substantially burden \nthe Diocese’s religious exercise. \n39.  It is therefore unclear whether the Government will conclude that the Diocese of \nJoliet qualifies as a “religious employer” under the narrow exemption from compliance with the \nU.S. Government Mandate. \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 12 of 63 PageID #:239\n \n40.  Regardless of whether the Government concludes that the Diocese qualifies for \nthe exemption, the Diocese is in every respect Roman Catholic. \n41.  Moreover, determining whether an organization—such as the Diocese of Joliet—\nqualifies for the exemption will require the Government to engage in an intrusive inquiry, based \non an understanding of religion that is  inconsistent with the Catholic faith, into whether, in the \nview of the Government, (1) the Diocese’s “purpose” is the “inculcation of religious values,” (2) \n \nwhether the Diocese “primarily” employs “persons who share [its] religious tenets,” even though \nit hires employees of all faiths and does not know how many Catholics it employs, and (3) \nwhether it “primarily” serves such people, even though its schools and social services are open \nto all.   \n42.  Regardless of outcome, the Diocese of Joliet strongly objects to such an intrusive \nand misguided governmental investigation into its religious mission. \n43.  Finally, the Diocese of Joliet operates a self-insured health plan.  That is, the \nDiocese does not contract with a separate insurance company that provides health care coverage \nto its employees.  Instead, the Diocese itself functions as the insurance company underwriting its \nemployees’ medical costs.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities Diocese of Joliet also offers coverage \nthrough the Diocese’s plan.   \n44.  Consistent with Church teachings, this plan does not cover abortion-inducing \ndrugs, sterilization, or contraceptives.  In limited circumstances, the Diocese’s health plan \nadministrator can override the exclusion of certain sterilization procedures or drugs commonly \nused as contraceptives if a physician certifies that they were prescribed with the intent of treating \ncertain medical conditions, not with the intent to prevent pregnancy.   \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 13 of 63 PageID #:240\n \n45.  The Diocese’s plan is administered by a third-party administrator, Blue Cross \nBlue Shield.  Blue Cross Blue Shield handles the administrative aspects of the Diocese’s self-\ninsured employee health plans, but Blue Cross Blue Shield bears none of the risks for benefits \nnor is it obligated to pay health care providers.     \n46.  The Diocese of Joliet’s self-insured health plan does not meet the Affordable Care \nAct’s definition of a “grandfathered” plan because, since March 23, 2010, the Diocese has \nincreased its percentage cost-sharing requirement and changed its premiums and added a tier.  \nFurther, the Diocese has not included and does not include a statement in plan materials \nprovided to participants or beneficiaries informing them that it believes its plan is a \ngrandfathered health plan within the meaning of section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act.  See, \ne.g., 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(i). \n47.  The plan year for the Diocese of Joliet (and the organizations it insures) begins on \nOctober 1. \nB.  Catholic Charities Diocese of Joliet, Inc. \n48.  Catholic Charities Joliet provides services to nearly 65,000 people annually, \napproximately 90 percent of whom live below the poverty line.  The organization began helping \nindividuals and families in crisis after World War I.  In 1962, it was officially incorporated and \nlicensed as a child welfare agency in the State of Illinois.  Today, its mission is to provide \nservice to people in need and call others of good will to do the same.  Catholic Charities Joliet \npursues these goals through its own programs and through partnerships with parishes, \ncommunity groups, and governmental agencies. \n49.  Catholic Charities Joliet is comprised of three divisions offering close to 40 \nprograms, providing a panoply of services that include permanent housing for the chronically \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 14 of 63 PageID #:241\n \nhomeless, emergency support for those who have recently lost their jobs and/or need help paying \ntheir rent or mortgage, senior companionship, Head Start programming, and many others.   \n50.  For example, Daybreak Shelter is one of the programs operated by Catholic \nCharities Joliet.  Daybreak provides both short-term housing for those in need as a result of \nsituational crises and supportive services for those working to reestablish permanent housing.  It \nalso provides homelessness prevention services to individuals and families at risk of losing their \nhomes; comprehensive case management, coordination, and assisted access of community \nresources; child care; and education assessments and services.  Daybreak sheltered almost 900 \nunduplicated individuals in 2011, and is the largest shelter in Will County.  A program called \nShepherd’s Table, located at Daybreak, also provides a free mid-day meal to members of the \ncommunity who are hungry and unable to provide for themselves.  Shepherd’s Table served a \ntotal of 29,332 unduplicated individuals in 2011.  \n51.  Catholic Charities Senior Case Management Program, another of Catholic \nCharities Joliet’s flagship programs, provides seniors and their families assistance as they assess \nthe need for care and coordinates an overall plan of service to maximize the senior’s \nindependence in the home.  Areas examined include medical care and supervision, personal care \nassistance, home maintenance, emergency response systems, financial needs, and living \narrangements.  The Senior Case Management Program served 9,070 unduplicated seniors and \ntheir families in 2011.         \n52.  Catholic Charities Joliet is a corporation affiliated with the Diocese of Joliet. \n53.  Catholic Charities Joliet has over 240 employees, nearly 200 of whom are eligible \nfor full benefits and an additional six of whom are eligible for pension benefits only.  While \nCatholic Charities Joliet asks its employees to abide by the teachings of the church, it does not \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 15 of 63 PageID #:242\n \ninquire about the religious commitments of its applicants for employment, and, as a result, it \ndoes not know how many of its employees are Catholic. \n54.  Catholic Charities Joliet serves people in need without regard to their religion.  It \ndoes not ask whether people whom it serves are Catholic and, therefore, it does not know \nwhether they are Catholic. \n55.  On information and belief, a majority of the people served by Catholic Charities \nare not Catholic. \n56.  Catholic Charities Joliet itself does not qualify as a “religious employer” under \nthe exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n57.  Catholic Charities Joliet employees are offered health insurance through the \nDiocese’s health plan.   \nC.  Diocese of Springfield \n58.  The Diocese of Springfield encompasses over 130 parishes serving over 142,800 \nCatholics in 28 counties in Central Illinois.  The Diocese is a trust, created in 1923.  The \nDiocese’s parishes and most of its 48 schools are part of the trust; the parishes are also, as of \nJuly 1, 2012, individually set up as trusts.  The charitable work of the Diocese is also performed \nthrough a number of separate, affiliated corporations. \n59.  Bishop Thomas John Paprocki, formerly the Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago, has led \nthe Diocese since June, 2010.  Bishop Paprocki is assisted in his ministry by a vicar general and \nby a staff of clergymen, religious brothers and sisters, and lay people.  The Diocese and its \naffiliated corporations have approximately 2,585 employees, some 1,600 of whom are benefits-\neligible.  While the Curial Office knows how many of its employees are Catholic, the parishes, \nschools, agencies, and institutions of the Diocese do not know how many of their employees are \nCatholic.  Thus, the Diocese does not know how many of its employees in total are Catholic. \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 16 of 63 PageID #:243\n \n60.  The Diocese of Springfield carries out a tripartite spiritual, educational, and social \nservice mission, reflecting the several dimensions of its ministry.  The spiritual ministry of the \nDiocese is conducted largely through its parishes: through the ministry of its priests, the Diocese \nensures the regular availability of the sacraments to all Catholics living in or visiting Central \nIllinois.  It also provides numerous other opportunities for prayer, worship, and faith formation.  \nEach year, tens of thousands of adults and children receive formation in the Catholic faith \nthrough parish-level and Diocesan classes, lectures, and retreats.  In 2011, 420 adults entered the \nCatholic Church through programs offered by the parishes of the Diocese.  In addition to \noverseeing the sacramental life of its parishes, the Diocese coordinates Catholic campus \nministries at seven colleges and universities within its borders.   \n61.  The Diocese of Springfield conducts its educational mission through its schools.  \nThere are 48 Catholic schools located in the Diocese—six high schools and 42 elementary \nschools, which educate over 11,000 children and employ nearly 1,100 teachers.  The Diocese \noperates all of the schools within the Diocese.   \n62.  The Diocesan schools welcome students in all financial conditions, from all \nbackgrounds, and of any or no faith.  In order to make a Catholic education available to as many \nchildren as possible, the Diocese of Springfield expends substantial funds in tuition assistance \nprograms; it awarded over 132,600 dollars in tuition assistance for the 2011-2012 school year.  \n17.6 percent of the students in the Diocesan elementary schools and 8.9 percent in the high \nschools are minorities.   \n63.  The Catholic educational system has demonstrated a particular dedication to \nteaching the underserved.  Schools like Cathedral in Springfield continue to exemplify the \nCatholic church’s dedication to teaching minority and non-Catholic youth.  Cathedral, a college \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 17 of 63 PageID #:244\n \npreparatory school with 99 percent college placement, currently serves 148 students, 25.7 \npercent of whom are minorities and 19.6 percent of whom are not Catholic.  Schools like \nCathedral are no less an expression and outgrowth of genuine Catholic belief because they serve \na large percentage of non-Catholics.  Indeed, quite the opposite: the Diocese sees these schools \nas a vital part of its mission to offer to every student, in every place, a safe, morally sound, and \nacademically rigorous education. \n64.  The Diocese of Springfield’s schools offer a unique experience.  To that end, the \nDiocesan schools have established three priorities that make them stand out from other \neducational institutions.  Students are taught faith—not just the basics of Christianity, but how to \nhave a relationship with God that will remain with them after they leave their Catholic schools.  \nService, the giving of one’s time and effort to help others, is taught as both a requirement of true \nfaith and good citizenship.  Finally, high academic standards help each student reach his or her \npotential.  One of the Diocese’s principals won an NCEA Distinguished Principal Award and an \nU.S. Department of Education National Distinguished Principals Award in 2009-2010.  \nNationally, over 99 percent of students in Catholic high schools graduate.   \n65.  The success of the Diocese’s approach to education is demonstrated by St. \nAmbrose Catholic School in Godfrey, Illinois.  The mission of St. Ambrose is to give students a \nstrong foundation in knowledge, skills, and religious truths and values.  The students have \nreceived numerous high rankings in curricular and extracurricular competitions, have won a \nnumber of scholarships, and have placed well in athletic championships.  On a nationwide \nachievement test, 95.7 percent of the Diocese’s 8th graders scored in the top half. \n66.  Much of the social service work of the Diocese of Springfield is performed \nthrough its parishes.  The parishes that comprise the Diocese maintain their own charitable \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 18 of 63 PageID #:245\n \nefforts, serving the needs of their communities with programs including employment and job \ntraining, adopt-a-family programs at Christmas, meals served to the homeless, and visits to \nnursing homes.  The Diocese oversees all of the social service work undertaken by its parishes.  \nNeither the Diocese nor its parishes keeps a tally of persons served through these outreach \nprograms, nor do they request to know the religious affiliation of those served. \n67.  In summary, the Diocese of Springfield—and the entire Catholic Church—is \ncommitted to serving anyone in need, regardless of religion. \n68.  In addition to serving individuals of all faiths, the Diocese also employs \nindividuals of all faiths. \n69.  The Diocese does not know how many of those it hires or serves are Catholic.  In \norder to determine those statistics, the Diocese would be required to ask the religious affiliation \nof all individuals that it employs or serves.  That inquiry, however, would substantially burden \nthe Diocese’s religious exercise. \n70.  It is therefore unclear whether the Government will conclude that the Diocese of \nSpringfield qualifies as a “religious employer” under the narrow exemption from compliance \nwith the U.S. Government Mandate. \n71.  Regardless of whether the Government concludes that the Diocese qualifies for \nthe exemption, the Diocese is in every respect Roman Catholic. \n72.  Moreover, determining whether an organization—such as the Diocese of \nSpringfield—qualifies for the exemption will require the Government to engage in an intrusive \ninquiry, based on an understanding of religion that is  inconsistent with the Catholic faith, into \nwhether, in the view of the Government, (1) the Diocese’s “purpose” is the “inculcation of \n \nreligious values,” (2) whether the Diocese “primarily” employs “persons who share [its] \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 19 of 63 PageID #:246\n \nreligious tenets,” even though it hires employees of all faiths and does not know how many \nCatholics it employs, and (3) whether it “primarily” serves such people, even though its schools \nand social services are open to all.   \n73.  Regardless of outcome, the Diocese of Springfield strongly objects to such an \nintrusive and misguided governmental investigation into its religious mission. \n74.  Finally, the Diocese of Springfield operates a self-insured health plan.  That is, the \nDiocese does not contract with a separate insurance company that provides health care coverage \nto its employees.  Instead, the Diocese itself functions as the insurance company underwriting its \nemployees’ medical costs.  Plaintiff Catholic Charities Springfield also offers coverage through \nthe Diocese’s plan.   \n75.  Consistent with Church teachings, this plan does not cover abortion-inducing \ndrugs, sterilization, or contraceptives.  In limited circumstances, the Diocese’s health plan \nadministrator can override the exclusion of certain drugs commonly used as contraceptives if a \nphysician certifies that they were prescribed with the intent of treating certain medical conditions, \nnot with the intent to prevent pregnancy.   \n76.  The Diocese’s plan is administered by a third-party administrator, Healthsmart \nBenefit Solutions.  Healthsmart Benefit Solutions handles the administrative aspects of the \nDiocese’s self-insured employee health plans, but Healthsmart Benefit Solutions bears none of \nthe risks for benefits nor is it obligated to pay health care providers.   \n77.  The Diocese of Springfield’s self-insured health plan currently meets the \nAffordable Care Act’s definition of a “grandfathered plan.”  The Diocese has included a \nstatement describing its grandfathered status in its Plan materials, as required by 26 C.F.R. § \n54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(ii).  \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 20 of 63 PageID #:247\n \n78.  The Diocese of Springfield is currently barred—now—from altering its plan in \nthe best interests of its employees for fear of losing the protection of its grandfathered status.  \nThe Diocese wants to change its plan in two ways: (1) increasing the prescription drug co-pay; \nand (2) adding a co-pay on emergency room visits.  But, the Diocese is stuck in perpetuity with \nproviding its current plan, and forgoing substantial modifications that may benefit its plan \nparticipants and the organization as a whole, simply to avoid compromising its core religious \nbeliefs.  Without judicial review, the Diocese of Springfield will continue to suffer hardship.   \n79. In any event, the Diocese of Springfield will lose its grandfathered status in the near \nfuture for reasons that cannot be avoided.  For example, the employee contribution to the \npremium cannot increase by more than 5 percent of the cost of coverage compared to the \nemployee contribution on March 23, 2010.  26 C.F.R. §54.9815-1251T(g)(1)(v).  Given the \ncurrent trajectory of health care costs, the Diocese of Springfield anticipates that employee \ncontributions to its plan will exceed that 5 percent within the next few years.  Even the \nGovernment acknowledges that the number of grandfathered health plans will decrease \nsubstantially in the near future.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 41,276, 41731 (July 19, 2010). \n80.  Thus, the Diocese of Springfield has standing to invoke the power of this Court to \nredress the injuries it is presently suffering and, in addition, other imminent injuries that it is \nlikely to suffer in the near future. \n81.  The plan year for the Diocese of Springfield begins on July 1. \nD.  Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Springfield-in-Illinois \n82.  Catholic Charities Springfield provides services to nearly 60,000 people annually, \napproximately 85 percent of whom live below the poverty line.  The organization was first \nestablished as the Catholic Social Service in 1925.  Today, Catholic Charities Springfield is a \nnationally accredited and licensed child welfare agency providing professional, quality social \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 21 of 63 PageID #:248\n \nservices to children and families with a wide range of needs.  Catholic Charities Springfield \npursues these goals through its own programs and through partnerships with parishes, \ncommunity groups, and governmental agencies. \n83.  Catholic Charities Springfield is comprised of 9 divisions offering 18 programs, \nproviding a panoply of services that includes serving abused and neglected children, ministering \nto the sick, working to keep families together and to make them whole again, ensuring that \nseniors can live out their lives with dignity, and providing food and clothing to those in need.   \n84.  For example, Catholic Children’s Home (“CCH”) is one of the programs operated \nby Catholic Charities Springfield.  Through its residential programs, CCH provides emergency \nshelter care, long-term residential care, and independent living programs for children who are \nwards of the state and victims of abuse and neglect.

Catholic Charities Springfield serves people in need without regard to their \nreligion.  It does not ask whether people whom it serves are Catholic and, therefore, it does not \nknow whether they are Catholic. \n89.  On information and belief, a majority of the people served by Catholic Charities \nSpringfield are not Catholic. \n90.  Catholic Charities Springfield itself does not qualify as a “religious employer” \nunder the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n91.  Catholic Charities Springfield employees are offered health insurance through the \nDiocese’s health plan.   \nE.  Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago \n92.  Catholic Charities Chicago is one of the largest private, not-for-profit, social \nservice agencies in the Midwest, annually serving over one million persons in Cook and Lake \ncounties.  Through its many programs, services, and partnerships, Catholic Charities Chicago \nprovides an invaluable and indeed necessary safety net for the most needy and vulnerable \nmembers of communities throughout the Chicagoland area.  Catholic Charities Chicago’s impact \non Chicago cannot be overstated, as an estimated one of every eight people who live in the \nregion is touched in some way by Catholic Charities Chicago.   \n93.  Catholic Charities Chicago’s purpose is to carry out the mandates of the Gospel \nand the social teaching of the Catholic Church through works of Christian charity, service, and \nsocial justice by providing competent and caring social services, special assistance to those in \ngreat need, and programs of community outreach and advocacy using the skills and talents of \nprofessional staff and volunteers.  Catholic Charities Chicago pursues these goals through its \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 23 of 63 PageID #:250\n \nown programs and through partnerships with parishes, community groups, and governmental \nagencies. \n94.  Catholic Charities Chicago fulfills the Catholic Church’s commitment to charity \nfor all people in need regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof by providing \ncompassionate, competent, professional services that strengthen and support individuals, \nfamilies and communities.  Catholic Charities Chicago currently operates 157 programs in 162 \nsites across all of Cook and Lake counties, feeding, sheltering, and clothing disadvantaged \npersons, and helping them along the path toward self-sufficiency.  Catholic Charities Chicago’s \nservices address the fundamental requirements of impoverished children, families, veterans, and \nseniors.  Catholic Charities Chicago’s clients have access to a comprehensive wraparound \nnetwork of services designed to meet all of the clients’ basic human needs.  Catholic Charities \nChicago’s complementary services  range from food pantries to mental health counseling, \naffordable housing, senior services, employment placement, and almost everything in between.  \nCatholic Charities Chicago’s goal is to help each client become as self-sufficient as possible. \n95.  One example of Catholic Charities Chicago’s services is the Homelessness \nPrevention Call Center (“Call Center”) operated by Catholic Charities Chicago in partnership \nwith the City of Chicago and other charitable organizations.  The Call Center is a critical \ncomponent of Catholic Charities Chicago’s ongoing involvement in a collaborative effort among \nmunicipal governments and private charitable entities to reduce the numbers of homeless \npersons in Chicago and its suburban areas.  Catholic Charities Chicago staffs the Call Center \nwith referral specialists who provide at-risk families with information about the various funding \nresources available to assist them.  Within the City of Chicago, the program connects with \npersons in need of its help through the City of Chicago’s city services hotline, 3-1-1.  As a result \n  23 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 24 of 63 PageID #:251\n \nof the collaborative homelessness prevention effort between Catholic Charities Chicago and the \nCity of Chicago, any caller to the hotline who requests “short term help” in avoiding \nhomelessness is automatically transferred to the Call Center and connected with the appropriate \nresources.  Since opening in January 2007, the Call Center has responded to over 350,000 calls.   \n96.  Catholic Charities Chicago also provides a wide variety of important \nimmigration-related services.  Through its Immigrant Family Resource Center, Catholic \nCharities Chicago helps newly immigrated individuals in Chicago and its suburbs find access to \nhealth care, food stamps, and other survival needs.  The Immigrant Family Resource Center \nhosts information sessions at sites throughout Chicago and the suburbs and provides assistance \nwith assessing eligibility for benefits provided by the Illinois Department of Human Services.  \nCatholic Charities Chicago also provides assistance with the U.S. immigration system to U.S. \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents.  Catholic Charities Chicago assists eligible persons with \nfamily reunification applications, extensions of stay, replacement of permanent residence cards, \nwork permits, naturalization certificates, and inquiries for status of cases at the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services as well as at American consulates abroad.  Catholic Charities Chicago \nalso operates a Refugee Resettlement Program that provides core reception, home, and job \nplacement services to newly arrived refugees from all over the world. \n97.  Other examples of the services provided by Catholic Charities Chicago include: \n  Senior Home-Based Services.  Catholic Charities Chicago offers in-home \nservices for thousands of seniors in order to allow them to remain in their \nhomes and out of institutional care facilities.  Over 700 employees in the \nSenior Home-Based Services program provide economically-\ndisadvantaged elderly with basic necessities such as meals and medical \ncare.  The Senior Home-Based Services program and Catholic Charities \nChicago’s other senior assistance programs provided a strong support \nnetwork for more than 250,000 seniors in 2011. \n  Veterans Services.  Catholic Charities Chicago provides housing, job \n  24 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 25 of 63 PageID #:252\n \ntraining, and recovery services for veterans at a number of sites throughout \nthe Chicago area.  For example, at the St. Leo Campus for Veterans, \nCatholic Charities Chicago provides residences for both able-bodied and \ndisabled veterans and a resource center for job placement and benefits \nscreening.   \n  Nutrition Services. To fulfill its clients’ fundamental need for \nnourishment, Catholic Charities Chicago prepares meals for thousands of \nseniors, children, and families throughout the Chicago area.  As part of its \ncommitment to feeding the hungry, Catholic Charities Chicago offers \ndinner every night of the week at 7 sites throughout its territory for a total \nof 70,000 meals a year.   \n98.  Catholic Charities Chicago is a corporation affiliated with the Archdiocese of \nChicago.  \n99.  Catholic Charities Chicago has approximately 2,700 full- and part-time staff, \napproximately 1,600 of whom are benefits-eligible.  Catholic Charities Chicago does not inquire \nabout the religious commitments or affiliations of its applicants for employment, and, as a result, \nit does not know how many of its employees are Catholic. \n100.  Catholic Charities Chicago serves people in need without regard to their religion.  \nIt does not ask whether people whom it serves are Catholic and, therefore, it does not know \nwhether they are Catholic. \n101.  On information and belief, a majority of the people served by Catholic Charities \nChicago are not Catholic. \n102.  Catholic Charities Chicago itself does not qualify as a “religious employer” under \nthe exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n103.  Catholic Charities Chicago offers health insurance through the Catholic Charities \nUSA Employee Welfare Benefit Trust (“CCUSA Trust”), a self-funded welfare benefit plan.  \nThe CCUSA Trust is both the plan sponsor and the plan administrator.  CareFirst Administrator \n(“CFA”) is an independent licensee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.  The CFA Group \n  25 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 26 of 63 PageID #:253\n \nprovides administrative services only and does not assume any financial risk or obligation with \nrespect to health care benefit claims for the self-insured portion of the plan. \n104.  The plan does not cover abortion-inducing drugs or sterilization.  Contraceptives \nare not covered by the plan unless a physician provides a letter specifically explaining why they \nare necessary for medical treatment unrelated to contraception.   \n105.  Catholic Charities Chicago’s health plan does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s \ndefinition of a “grandfathered” plan because, since March 23, 2010, Catholic Charities Chicago \nhas changed its insurance carrier.  Further, Catholic Charities Chicago has not included and does \nnot include a statement in plan materials provided to participants or beneficiaries informing them \nthat it believes its plan is a grandfathered health plan within the meaning of section 1251 of the \nAffordable Care Act.  See, e.g., 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(i).   \n106.  The plan year for Catholic Charities Chicago begins on January 1. \nF.  Saint Patrick High School \n107.  Saint Patrick High School is an all-male college preparatory Catholic high school \nlocated in the Belmont-Cragin neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago, Illinois.  It was \nopened in 1861 by the Brothers of the Christian Schools (or, De La Salle Christian Brothers) and \nis the oldest all-male Catholic high school in Chicago.  As Saint Patrick High School states in its \nCore Values, Saint Patrick High School is “Catholic in faith, Lasallian in tradition”; it \n“believe[s] in an educational process that is student centered and of the highest quality”; and it \n“believe[s] in and foster[s] service opportunities for students and faculty.” \n108.  In 2011-2012, Saint Patrick High School educated over 800 students.  It \nwelcomes students in all financial conditions, from all backgrounds, and of any or no faith.  In \norder to make a Catholic education available to as many children as possible, Saint Patrick High \nSchool expends substantial funds in tuition assistance programs; it awarded $1.1 million in \n  26 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 27 of 63 PageID #:254\n \ntuition assistance in 2011-2012 alone.  37-38 percent of Saint Patrick High School’s students are \nminorities. \n109.  Saint Patrick High School’s academic success is evident from the many awards \nand scholarships its students have earned and from its students’ rate of college placement.  In \n2011, the Evans Scholars Foundation awarded scholarships to five Saint Patrick High School \nstudents; it awarded another two scholarships in 2012.  Also in 2012, Saint Patrick had a \nNational Merit Finalist and the maximum allowable number of Illinois State Scholars.  95 \npercent of Saint Patrick’s students go on to college and university studies; the other 5 percent \njoin the military or seek vocational education.  In 2012, Saint Patrick’s graduating class was \noffered over $10.3 million in college scholarship grants. \n110.  Saint Patrick High School has approximately 95 full- and part-time employees, 92 \nof whom are benefits-eligible.  Saint Patrick does not inquire about the religious commitments or \naffiliations of its applicants for employment, unless those applicants are applying to teach \nreligion. \n111.  Saint Patrick High School educates students without regard to their religion. \n112.  Saint Patrick High School itself does not qualify as a “religious employer” under \nthe exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n113.  Saint Patrick High School offers health insurance through the Christian Brothers \nEmployee Benefit Trust, a self-funded welfare benefit plan.  The plan sponsor is the Trustees of \nChristian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, and Christian Brothers Services (appointed by the \nTrustees) is the plan administrator.  \n114.  The plan does not cover abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or contraception \n(unless pre-authorized and used for medical illnesses, not contraception).   \n  27 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 28 of 63 PageID #:255\n \n115.  Saint Patrick High School’s health plan does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s \ndefinition of a “grandfathered” plan because the plan has not included and does not include a \nstatement in plan materials provided to participants or beneficiaries informing them that the plan \nis a grandfathered health plan within the meaning of section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act.  \nSee, e.g., 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(2)(i).   \n116.  The plan year for Saint Patrick High School begins on January 1. \nII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory Background \n117.  In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \nPub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the \n“Act”).  The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for “group health plan[s],” \nbroadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plan[s]” within the meaning of the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care . . \n. to employees or their dependents.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).     \n118.  As relevant here, the Act requires an employer’s group health plan to cover \ncertain women’s “preventive care.”  Specifically, it indicated that “[a] group health plan and a \nhealth insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a \nminimum[,] provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for—(4) \nwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \npurposes of this paragraph.”  Pub. L. No. 111-148 § 1001(5), 124 Stat. 131 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4)).  Because the Act prohibits “cost sharing requirements,” the health plan must \npay for the full costs of these “preventive care” services without any deductible or co-payment. \n  28 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 29 of 63 PageID #:256\n \n119.  “[T]he Affordable Care Act preserves the ability of individuals to retain coverage \nunder a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which the individual was enrolled on \nMarch 23, 2010.”  Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers \nRelating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 41,731 (July 19, 2010) (“Interim Final Rules”); 42 U.S.C. § 18011.  \nThese so-called “grandfathered health plans do not have to meet the requirements” of the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate.  75 Fed. Reg. at 41,731.  HHS estimates that “98 million individuals will \nbe enrolled in grandfathered group health plans in 2013.”  Id. at 41,732.     \n120.  Violations of the Affordable Care Act can subject an employer and an insurer to \nsubstantial monetary penalties. \n121.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain employers who fail to offer “full-time \nemployees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under \nan eligible employer-sponsored plan” will be exposed to significant annual fines of $2,000 per \nfull-time employee.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). \n122.  Additionally, under the Internal Revenue Code, group health plans that fail to \nprovide certain required coverage may be subject to an assessment of $100 a day per individual.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b); see also Jennifer Staman & Jon Shimabukuro, Cong. Research Serv., \nRL 7-5700, Enforcement of the Preventative Health Care Services Requirements of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (2012) (asserting that this applies to employers who violate \nthe “preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n123.  Under the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of HHS may impose a \nmonetary penalty of $100 a day per individual where an insurer fails to provide the coverage \nrequired by the U.S. Government Mandate.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(i); see also \n  29 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 30 of 63 PageID #:257\n \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 (asserting that this penalty applies to insurers who violate the \n“preventive care” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n124.  ERISA may provide for additional penalties.  Under ERISA, plan participants can \nbring civil actions against insurers for unpaid benefits.  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); see also \nCong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700.  Similarly, the Secretary of Labor may bring an enforcement \naction against group health plans of employers that violate the U.S. Government Mandate, as \nincorporated by ERISA.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(b)(3); see also Cong. Research Serv., RL 7-5700 \n(asserting that these penalties can apply to employers and insurers who violate the “preventive \ncare” provision of the Affordable Care Act).  \n125.  Several of the Act’s provisions, along with other federal statutes, reflect a clear \ncongressional intent that the executive agency charged with identifying the “preventive care” \nrequired by § 300gg-13(a)(4) should exclude all abortion-related services.  The Act itself states \nthat “nothing in this title (or any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to require a \nqualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part of its essential health \nbenefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  And the Act left it to “the issuer of a \nqualified health plan,” not the Government, “[to] determine whether or not the plan provides \ncoverage of [abortion].”  Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n126.  Likewise, the Weldon Amendment, which has been included in every HHS and \nDepartment of Labor appropriations bill since 2004, prohibits certain agencies from \ndiscriminating against an institution based on that institution’s refusal to provide abortion-related \nservices.  Specifically, it states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this Act [to the \nDepartment of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be made available \nto a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government subjects any \n  30 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 31 of 63 PageID #:258\n \ninstitutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care \nentity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 \n(2011). \n127.  The legislative history of the Act also demonstrates a clear congressional intent to \nprohibit the executive branch from requiring group health plans to provide abortion-related \nservices.  For example, the House of Representatives originally passed a bill that included an \namendment by Congressman Bart Stupak prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion \nservices.  See H.R. 3962, 111th Cong. § 265 (Nov. 7, 2009).  The Senate version, however, lacked \nthat restriction.  S. Amend. No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (Dec. 23, 2009).  To avoid a \nfilibuster in the Senate, congressional proponents of the Act engaged in a procedure known as \n“budget reconciliation” that required the House to adopt the Senate version of the bill largely in \nits entirety.  Congressman Stupak and other pro-life House members, however, indicated that they \nwould refuse to vote for the Senate version because it failed adequately to prohibit federal \nfunding of abortion.  In an attempt to address these concerns, President Obama issued an \nexecutive order providing that no executive agency would authorize the federal funding of \nabortion services.  See Exec. Order No. 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. 15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).   \n128.  The Act was, therefore, passed on the central premise that all agencies would \nuphold and follow “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” and to prohibit federal \nfunding of abortion.  Id.  That executive order was consistent with a 2009 speech that President \nObama gave at the University of Notre Dame, in which he indicated that his Administration \nwould honor the consciences of those who disagree with abortion, and draft sensible conscience \nclauses. \n  31 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 32 of 63 PageID #:259\n \nB.  Regulatory Background—Defining “Preventive Care” and the Narrow Exemption \n129.  In a span of less than two years, Defendants promulgated the U.S. Government \nMandate, subverting the Act’s clear purpose to protect the rights of conscience.  The U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, moreover, was implemented contrary to the normal procedural rules \ngoverning the promulgation and implementation of rules of this magnitude.  \n130.  In particular, on July 19, 2010, Defendants issued initial interim final rules \nconcerning § 300gg-13(a)(4)’s requirement that group health plans provide coverage for women’s \n“preventive care.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726.  Defendants dispensed with notice-\nand-comment rulemaking for these rules.  Even though federal law had never required coverage \nof abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or contraceptives, Defendants claimed both that the APA \ndid not apply to the relevant provisions of the Affordable Care Act and that “it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay putting the provisions in these interim \nfinal regulations in place until a full public notice and comment process was completed.”  Id. at \n41,730.     \n131.  The interim final rules referred to the Affordable Care Act’s statutory language.  \nThey indicated that “a group health plan . . . must provide coverage for all of the following items \nand services, and may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, \ncoinsurance, or deductible) with respect to those items or services: . . . (iv) With respect to \nwomen, to the extent not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence-informed \npreventive care and screenings provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health \nResources and Services Administration.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. Reg. at 41,759 (codified at \n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)).   \n132.  The interim final rules, however, failed to identify the women’s “preventive care” \nthat Defendants planned to require employer group health plans to cover.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-\n  32 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 33 of 63 PageID #:260\n \n13(a)(4).  Instead, Defendants noted that “[t]he Department of HHS [was] developing these \nguidelines and expects to issue them no later than August 1, 2011.”  Interim Final Rules, 75 Fed. \nReg. at 41,731.     \n133.  Defendants permitted concerned entities to provide written comments about the \ninterim final rules.  See id. at 41,726.  But, as Defendants have conceded, they did not comply \nwith the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA.  Id. at 41,730. \n134.  In response, several groups engaged in a lobbying effort to persuade Defendants \nto include various contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in the “preventive care” \nrequirements for group health plans.  See, e.g., Press Release, Planned Parenthood, Planned \nParenthood Supports Initial White House Regulations on Preventive Care (July 14, 2010), \navailable at http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-\nparenthood-supports-initial-white-house-regulations-preventive-care-highlights-need-new-\n33140.htm.  Other commenters noted that “preventive care” could not reasonably be interpreted \nto include such practices.  These groups indicated that pregnancy was not a disease that needed \nto be “prevented,” and that a contrary view would intrude on the sincerely held beliefs of many \nreligiously affiliated organizations.  See, e.g., Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, at 1-2 (Sept. 17, 2010), available at http://old.usccb.org/ogc/preventive.pdf. \n135.  On August 1, 2011, HHS announced the “preventive care” services that group \nhealth plans would be required to cover.  See Press Release, HHS, Affordable Care Act Ensures \nWomen Receive Preventive Services at No Additional Cost (Aug. 1, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110801b.html.  Again acting without notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking, HHS announced these guidelines through a press release rather than \nenactments in the Code of Federal Regulations or statements in the Federal Register.   \n  33 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 34 of 63 PageID #:261\n \n136.  The press release made clear that the guidelines were developed by a non-\ngovernmental “independent” organization, the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”).  See id.  In \ndeveloping the guidelines, IOM invited certain groups to make presentations on preventive care. \nOn information and belief, no  groups that oppose government-mandated coverage of abortion, \ncontraception, and related education and counseling were among the invited presenters.  Comm. \non Preventive Servs. for Women, Inst. of Med., Clinical Preventive Services for Women app. B at \n217-21 (2011), http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13181&page=R1. \n137.  The IOM’s own report, in turn, included a dissent that suggested that the IOM’s \nrecommendations were made on an unduly short time frame dictated by political considerations, \nthrough a process that was largely subject to the preferences of the committee’s composition, and \nwithout the appropriate transparency for all concerned persons.        \n138.  In direct contradiction of the central compromise necessary for the Affordable \nCare Act’s passage and President Obama’s promise to protect religious liberty, HHS’s guidelines \nrequired insurers and group health plans to cover  “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all \nwomen with reproductive capacity.”  See Health Res. Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive \nServices: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ \n(last visited Apr. 25, 2012).  FDA-approved contraceptives that qualify under these guidelines \ninclude drugs that induce abortions.  For example, the FDA has approved “emergency \ncontraceptives” such as the morning-after pill (otherwise known as Plan B), which can prevent an \nembryo from implanting in the womb, and Ulipristal (otherwise known as HRP 2000 or ella), \nwhich likewise can induce abortions. \n  34 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 35 of 63 PageID #:262\n \n139.  A few days later, on August 3, 2011, Defendants issued amendments to the \ninterim final rules that they had enacted in July 2010.  See Group Health Plans and Health \nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011).  Defendants issued the amendments \nagain without notice-and-comment rulemaking on the same grounds that they had provided for \nbypassing the APA with the original rules.  See id. at 46,624.       \n140.  When announcing the amended regulations, Defendants ignored the view that \n“preventive care” should exclude abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or contraceptives that do \nnot prevent disease.  Instead, they noted only that “commenters [had] asserted that requiring \ngroup health plans sponsored by religious employers to cover contraceptive services that their \nfaith deems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious freedom.”  Id. at \n46,623.   \n141.  Defendants then sought “to provide for a religious accommodation that \nrespect[ed]” only “the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in \nministerial positions.”  Id.   \n142.  Specifically, the regulatory exemption ignores definitions of religious employers \nalready existing in federal law and, instead, covers only those employers whose purpose is to \ninculcate religious values, and who employ and serve primarily individuals of the same religion.  \nIt provides in full: \n (A) In developing the binding health plan coverage guidelines \nspecified in this paragraph (a)(1)(iv), the Health Resources and \nServices Administration shall be informed by evidence and may \nestablish exemptions from such guidelines with respect to group \nhealth plans established or maintained by religious employers and \nhealth insurance coverage provided in connection with group \nhealth plans established or maintained by religious employers with \n  35 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 36 of 63 PageID #:263\n \nrespect to any requirement to cover contraceptive services under \nsuch guidelines. \n \n(B) For purposes of this subsection, a “religious employer” is an \norganization that meets all of the following criteria: \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the \norganization. \n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the \nreligious tenets of the organization. \n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the \nreligious tenets of the organization. \n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in \nsection 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n \nId. at 46,626 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(A)-(B)).   \n143.  The exemption excludes the health plans of all other religiously affiliated \nemployers that view their missions as providing charitable, educational, and employment \nopportunities to all those who request it, regardless of their religious faith.   \n144.  Moreover, determining whether an organization is sufficiently “religious” to \nqualify for the exemption requires an unconstitutionally invasive inquiry into an organization’s \nreligious beliefs and practices.  For example, the Government must determine the “religious \ntenets” of an organization and the individuals it employs and serves; it must determine whether \nthe organization “primarily” employs and “primarily” serves individuals who “share” the \norganization’s  “religious tenets”; and it must determine whether “the purpose” of the \norganization is the “inculcation of religious values.” \n145.  When issuing this interim final rule, Defendants did not explain why they \nconstructed such a narrow religious exemption.  Nor did Defendants explain why they refused to \nincorporate other “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience” that President Obama’s \nexecutive order previously had promised to respect.  See Exec. Order No. 13535, 75 Fed. Reg. \n15,599 (Mar. 24, 2010).  ERISA, for example, has long excluded “church plans” from its \n  36 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 37 of 63 PageID #:264\n \nrequirements, more broadly defined to cover civil law corporations that share religious bonds \nwith a church.  See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1002(33)(C)(iv), 1003.  Likewise, the Affordable Care Act’s  \nrequirement that all individuals maintain minimum essential coverage excludes those individuals \nwho have a religious objection to receiving benefits from public or private insurance.  26 U.S.C. \n§§ 1402(g)(1), 5000A(d)(2).  Nor did Defendants consider whether they had a compelling \ninterest to require religiously affiliated employers to include services in their health plans that \nwere contrary to their religious beliefs, or whether Defendants could achieve their views of \nsound policy in a more religiously accommodating manner. \n146.  Suggesting that they were open to good-faith discussion, Defendants once again \npermitted parties to provide comments to the amended rules.  Numerous organizations expressed \nthe same concerns that they had before, noting that the mandated services should not be viewed \nas “preventive care.”  They also explained that the religious exemption was “narrower than any \nconscience clause ever enacted in federal law, and narrower than the vast majority of religious \nexemptions from state contraceptive mandates.”  Comments of U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops at 1-2 (Aug. 31, 2011), available at http://www.usccb.org/about/general-\ncounsel/rulemaking/upload/comments-to-hhs-on-preventive-services-2011-08.pdf.  Others \nsubmitted their own comments emphasizing that “[p]regnancy is not a disease, and drugs and \nsurgeries to prevent it are not basic health care that the government should require all Americans \nto purchase.”  Comments of Archdiocese of Washington at 1 (Sept. 30, 2011), available at \nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/1210-AB44a-14694.pdf. \n147.  Three months later, “[a]fter evaluating [the new] comments” to the interim final \nrules, Defendants gave their response.  They did not request further discussion or make attempts \nat compromise.  Nor did they explain the basis for their decision.  Instead, Defendant Sebelius \n  37 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 38 of 63 PageID #:265\n \nissued a short, Friday-afternoon press release, announcing, with little analysis or reasoning, that \nHHS had decided to keep the exemption unchanged, but creating a temporary enforcement safe \nharbor whereby “[n]onprofit employers who, based on religious beliefs, do not currently provide \ncontraceptive coverage in their insurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until August \n1, 2013, to comply with the new law.”  See Press Release, HHS, A Statement by U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (Jan. 20, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html.  As noted by Cardinal Timothy \nDolan, the Archbishop of New York, the release effectively gave objecting religious institutions \n“a year to figure out how to violate [their] consciences.”  Taken together, these various rules and \npress releases amount to a mandate that requires most religiously affiliated organizations to \nprovide coverage for services to their employees that are directly contrary to their religious \nbeliefs.     \n148.  On February 10, 2012, after a continuing public outcry against the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate and its exceedingly narrow conscience protections, the White House held a \npress conference and issued another press release about the U.S. Government Mandate.  The \nWhite House announced that it had come up with a policy to “accommodate” religious objections \nto the U.S. Government Mandate, according to which the insurance companies of religious \norganizations that object to providing coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or \ncontraceptives “will be required to directly offer . . . contraceptive care [to plan participants] free \nof charge.”  White House, Fact Sheet: Women’s Preventive Services and Religious Institutions \n(Feb. 10, 2012), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-\nwomen-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutions.   \n  38 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 39 of 63 PageID #:266\n \n149.  Despite objections that this “accommodation” did nothing of substance to protect \nthe right of conscience, when asked if there would be further room for compromise, White \nHouse Chief of Staff Jacob Lew responded: “No, this is our plan.”  David Eldridge & Cheryl \nWetzstein, White House Says Contraception Compromise Will Stand, The Washington Times, \nFeb. 12, 2012, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/12/white-house-birth-control-\ncompromise-will-stand/print/.    \n150.  Defendants subsequently explained in the Federal Register that they “plan[ned] to \ninitiate a rulemaking to require issuers to offer insurance without contraception coverage to [an \nobjecting religious] employer (or plan sponsor) and simultaneously to offer contraceptive \ncoverage directly to the employer’s plan participants (and their beneficiaries) who desire it, with \nno cost-sharing.”  Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of \nPreventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, \n8728 (Feb. 15, 2012).  The Federal Register further asserted that the rulemaking would “achieve \nthe same goals for self-insured group health plans.”  Id. \n151.  Defendants then “finalize[d], without change,” the interim final rules containing \nthe religious employer exemption, 77 Fed. Reg. at 8729, and issued guidelines regarding the \npreviously announced “temporary enforcement safe harbor” for “non-exempted, non-profit \nreligious organizations with religious objections to such coverage.”  Id. at 8725; see Ctr for \nConsumer Info. & Ins. Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor (Feb. \n10, 2012), available at http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-\nPreventive-Services-Bulletin.pdf.  \n152.  On March 16, 2012, Defendants issued an Advance Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking (“ANPRM”) seeking comment on various ways to structure the proposed \n  39 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 40 of 63 PageID #:267\n \naccommodation.  Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. \n16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  The proposed scenarios require an “independent entity” to provide \ncoverage for the objectionable services at no cost to the participants.  But private entities do not \nprovide insurance coverage “for free.”  Moreover, even if these proposals were adopted, they \nwould still require religious organizations to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the \nobjectionable services.  Finally, it is also unclear whether the Government has statutory authority \nto implement each of the possibilities referenced in the ANPRM.   \n153.  The ANPRM does not alter existing law.  It merely states an intention to do so at \nsome point in the future.  But a promise to change the law, whether issued by the White House or \nin the form of an ANPRM, does not, in fact, change the law.  The U.S. Government Mandate is \ntherefore the current, operative law.  Plaintiffs have until the start of the next plan year following \nAugust 1, 2013, to come into compliance with this law. \nIII.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANDATE IMPOSES AN IMMEDIATE AND \nSUBSTANTIAL BURDEN ON PLAINTIFFS’ RELIGIOUS LIBERTY \nA.  The U.S. Government Mandate Substantially Burdens Plaintiffs’ Religious Beliefs \n154.  Responding to the U.S. Government Mandate, Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl, the \nArchbishop of Washington, has declared that “what is at stake here is a question of human \nfreedom.”  And indeed it is.  Since the founding of this country, our society and legal system \nhave recognized that individuals and institutions are entitled to freedom of conscience and \nreligious practice.  As noted by Thomas Jefferson, “[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to \nbe dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of civil \nauthority.” \n  40 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 41 of 63 PageID #:268\n \n155.  The U.S. Government Mandate seeks to require Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, \nand/or facilitate access to services that are contrary to their religious beliefs.  It thus severely \nburdens Plaintiffs’ firmly held religious beliefs. \n156.  The U.S. Government Mandate also seeks to compel Plaintiffs to fund related \n“patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  It therefore \ncompels Plaintiffs to pay for, provide, and/or facilitate speech that is contrary to their firmly held \nreligious beliefs. \n157.  Although the U.S. Government Mandate contains a narrow religious exemption, \nin order to qualify, religious organizations must submit to an invasive governmental inquiry \nregarding their purpose and religious beliefs.  Requiring Plaintiffs to submit to this government-\nconducted religious test likewise substantially burdens their firmly held religious beliefs.  \n158.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret “the purpose” of an \norganization.  \n159.  It is unclear how the Government defines or will interpret vague terms, such as \n“primarily,” “share,” and “religious tenets.”   \n160.  It is unclear how the Government will ascertain the “religious tenets” of an \norganization, those it employs, and those it serves.   \n161.  It is unclear how much overlap the Government will require for religious tenets to \nbe “share[d].”   \n162.  Any attempt by Plaintiffs to qualify for the narrow religious employer exemption \nby restricting their charitable and educational mission to coreligionists would have devastating \neffects on the communities Plaintiffs serve. \n  41 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 42 of 63 PageID #:269\n \n163.  Indeed, the Government does not even provide Plaintiffs the option to attempt to \navoid the U.S. Government Mandate by exiting the health care market.  Eliminating its employee \ngroup health plan or refusing to provide plans that cover abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, or \ncontraceptives would expose each Plaintiff to substantial annual fines.  It is no “choice” to leave \nthose employees scrambling for health insurance while subjecting Plaintiffs to significant fines \nfor breaking the law.  Yet that is what the U.S. Government Mandate requires for Plaintiffs to \nadhere to their religious beliefs. \n164.  The U.S. Government Mandate also inhibits Plaintiffs’ ability to hire and retain \nemployees, attract students, and solicit charitable contributions. \n165.  Nor would the opaque, promised “accommodation”—even if it were law, which it \nis not—relieve Plaintiffs from the unconscionable  position in which the U.S. Government \nMandate currently puts them, for numerous reasons.   \n166.  First, the promised “accommodation” would not alter the fact that Plaintiffs would \nbe required to facilitate practices that run directly contrary to their beliefs.  Catholic teaching does \nnot simply require Catholic institutions to avoid directly paying for practices that are viewed as \nintrinsically immoral.  It also requires them to avoid actions that facilitate those practices.   \n167.  Second, any requirement that insurance companies or other independent entities \nprovide preventive services “free of charge” is illusory.  For-profit entities do not provide services \nfor free.  Instead, increased costs are passed through to consumers in the form of higher premiums \nor fees.  Under the proposed accommodation, doctors will still have to be paid to prescribe the \nobjectionable services and drug companies and pharmacists will still have to be paid for \nproviding them.  Hypothetical future savings cannot be used to pay those fees; rather, the money \nwill necessarily be derived from increased premiums or fees. \n  42 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 43 of 63 PageID #:270\n \n168.  Third, the “accommodation” does not affect the narrow exemption applicable to \n“religious employers.”  To qualify for that narrow exemption, religious organizations must submit \nto an invasive governmental inquiry.  Requiring Plaintiffs to submit to this government-conducted \ntest to determine if Plaintiffs are sufficiently religious is inappropriate and substantially burdens \ntheir firmly held religious beliefs.   \n169.  Finally, as noted below, the U.S. Government Mandate is burdening Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs right now.  Plaintiffs cannot possibly wait until August 1, 2013, to determine \nhow to respond to the U.S. Government Mandate.   \n170.  In short, while the President claimed to have “f[ou]nd a solution that works for \neveryone” and that ensures that “[r]eligious liberty will be protected,” in reality, his promised \n“accommodation” does neither.  Unless and until this issue is definitively resolved, the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate does and will continue to impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs.  \nB.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not a Neutral Law of General Applicability  \n171.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability.  It \noffers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans include or \nfacilitate coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraception, and related education \nand counseling.  It was, moreover, implemented by and at the behest of individuals and \norganizations who disagree with certain religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception, \nand thus targets religious organizations for disfavored treatment.  \n172.  For example, the U.S. Government Mandate exempts all “grandfathered” plans \nfrom its requirements.   \n173.   The Government has also crafted a religious exemption to the U.S. Government \nMandate that favors certain religions over others.  As noted, it applies only to plans sponsored by \n  43 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 44 of 63 PageID #:271\n \nreligious organizations that have, as their “purpose,” the “inculcation of religious values”; that \n“primarily” serve individuals that share their “religious tenets”; and that “primarily” employ such \nindividuals.  45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(B).   \n174.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, was promulgated by Government \nofficials, and supported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose certain \nCatholic teachings and beliefs.  For example, on October 5, 2011, Defendant Sebelius spoke at a \nfundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America.  Defendant Sebelius has long supported abortion \nrights and criticized Catholic teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception.  \nNARAL Pro-Choice America is a pro-abortion organization that likewise opposes many Catholic \nteachings.  At that fundraiser, Defendant Sebelius criticized individuals and entities whose beliefs \ndiffered from those held by her and the other attendees of the NARAL Pro-Choice America \nfundraiser, stating: “Wouldn’t you think that people who want to reduce the number of abortions \nwould champion the cause of widely available, widely affordable contraceptive services?  Not so \nmuch.”   \n175.  Consequently, on information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the purpose of the \nU.S. Government Mandate, including the narrow exemption, is to discriminate against religious \ninstitutions and organizations that oppose abortion and contraception.   \nC.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Not the Least Restrictive Means of Furthering a \nCompelling Governmental Interest \n176.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to promoting a \ncompelling governmental interest. \n177.  The Government has no compelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to violate their \nsincerely held religious beliefs by requiring them to provide, pay for, or facilitate access to \nabortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraceptives, and related education and counseling.  The \n  44 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 45 of 63 PageID #:272\n \nGovernment itself has relieved numerous other employers from this requirement by exempting \ngrandfathered plans and plans of employers it deems to be sufficiently religious. Moreover, these \nservices are widely available in the United States.  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that \nindividuals have a constitutional right to use such services.  And nothing that Plaintiffs do inhibits \nany individual from exercising that right.   \n178.  Even assuming the interest was compelling, the Government has numerous \nalternatives to furthering that interest other than forcing Plaintiffs to violate their religious beliefs.  \nFor example, the Government could have provided or paid for the objectionable services itself \nthrough other programs established by a duly enacted law.  Or, at a minimum, it could have \ncreated a broader exemption for religious employers, such as those found in numerous state laws \nthroughout the country and in other federal laws.  The Government therefore cannot possibly \ndemonstrate that requiring Plaintiffs to violate their consciences is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering its interest. \n179.  The U.S. Government Mandate, moreover, would simultaneously undermine both \nreligious freedom—a fundamental right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution—and access to the \nwide variety of social and educational services that Plaintiffs provide.  The Diocese of Joliet, \nDiocese of Springfield, and Saint Patrick High School educate children whose families want an \nalternative to the public school system; and Catholic Charities Joliet, Catholic Charities \nSpringfield, and Catholic Charities Chicago provide a range of social services to the citizens of \nIllinois.  As President Obama acknowledged in his February 10th announcement, religious \norganizations like Plaintiffs do “more good for a community than a government program ever \ncould.”  The U.S. Government Mandate, however, puts these good works in jeopardy.  \n  45 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 46 of 63 PageID #:273\n \n180.   That is unconscionable.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate cannot lawfully be applied to Plaintiffs, an injunction barring its \nenforcement, and an order vacating the Mandate. \nD.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Excessively \nEntangles the Government in Religion and Interferes with Religious Institutions’ \nReligious Doctrine   \n181.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s religious employer exemption further \nexcessively entangles the Government in defining the purpose and religious tenets of each \norganization and its employees and beneficiaries.   \n182.  In order to determine whether the Diocese of Joliet and Diocese of Springfield—\nor any other religious organization—qualify for the exemption, the Government would have to \nidentify the organizations’ “religious tenets” and determine whether “the purpose” of the \norganizations is to “inculcate” those tenets. \n183.  The Government would then have to conduct an inquiry into the practices and \nbeliefs of the individuals that the organizations ultimately employ and educate. \n184.  The Government would then have to compare and contrast those religious \npractices and beliefs to determine whether and how many of them are “share[d].” \n185.  Regardless of outcome, this inquiry is unconstitutional, and Plaintiffs strongly \nobject to such an intrusive governmental investigation into organizations’ religious mission.  \n186.  The religious employer exemption is based on an improper Government \ndetermination that “inculcation” is the only legitimate religious purpose.   \n187.  The Government should not base an exemption on an assessment of the “purity” \nor legitimacy of an institution’s  religious purpose.  \n188.  By limiting that legitimate purpose to “inculcation,” at the expense of other \nsincerely held religious purposes, the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with religious \n  46 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 47 of 63 PageID #:274\n \nautonomy.  Religious institutions have the right to determine their own religious purpose, \nincluding religious purposes broader than “inculcation,” without Government interference and \nwithout losing their religious liberties.   \n189.   Defining religion based on employing and serving primarily people who share the \norganization’s religious tenets directly contradicts Plaintiffs sincerely held religious beliefs \nregarding their religious mission to serve all people, regardless of whether or not they share the \nsame faith.   \n190.  This narrow exemption may protect some religious organizations.  But it does not \nprotect the many Catholic and other religious organizations that educate students of all faiths, \nprovide vital social services to individuals of all faiths, and employ individuals of all faiths.  The \nU.S. Government Mandate thus discriminates against such religious organizations because of \ntheir religious commitment to educate, serve, and employ people of all faiths. \n191.  It is unclear whether, if an entity qualifies as a “religious employer” for purposes \nof the exemption, any affiliated corporation that provides coverage to its employees through the \nexempt entity’s group health plan would also receive the benefit of the exemption.  Certain \nPreventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. at 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012). \n192.  It is unclear whether, if the Diocese of Joliet and/or Diocese of Springfield qualify \nas “religious employer[s]” under the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate, any affiliated \ncorporations that provide coverage to their employees through the Diocesan group health plans \nwould therefore also receive the benefit of the exemption. \nE.  The U.S. Government Mandate Is Causing Present Hardship to Plaintiffs That \nShould Be Remedied by a Court \n193.    The U.S. Government Mandate is already causing serious, ongoing hardship to \nPlaintiffs that merits judicial relief now. \n  47 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 48 of 63 PageID #:275\n \n194.  Health plans do not take shape overnight.  A number of analyses, negotiations, \nand decisions must occur each year before Plaintiffs can offer a health benefits package to their \nemployees.  For example, an employer that is self-insured—like the Diocese of Joliet, through \nwhich Catholic Charities Joliet offers insurance, or the Diocese of Springfield, through which \nCatholic Charities Springfield offers insurance—must work with actuaries to evaluate its funding \nreserves, and then negotiate with its third-party administrator to determine the cost of the \nproducts and services it wants.  An employer that is insured through another organization—like \nCatholic Charities Chicago and Saint Patrick High School—similarly must evaluate its funding \nreserves and work with the organization offering its insurance to guarantee that the plan will \noffer coverage for the products and services the employer wants.    \n195.  Under normal circumstances, Plaintiffs must begin the process of determining \ntheir health care package for a plan year at least four to six months before the plan year begins.  \nThe multiple levels of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Government Mandate make this already \nlengthy process even more complex. \n196.   For example, if Plaintiffs decide that the only tolerable option is to attempt to \nqualify as a “religious employer” under the U.S. Government Mandate, they will need to \nundertake a major overhaul of their corporate structures, hiring practices, and the scope of their \nprogramming.  This process could take years.  \n197.   In addition, if Plaintiffs do not comply with the U.S. Government Mandate, they \nmay be subject to annual government fines and penalties.  Plaintiffs require time to budget for \nany such additional expenses.   \n198.   The U.S. Government Mandate and its uncertain legality, moreover, undermine \nPlaintiffs’ ability to hire and retain employees. \n  48 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 49 of 63 PageID #:276\n \n199.   Plaintiffs therefore need judicial relief now in order to prevent the serious, \nongoing harm that the U.S. Government Mandate is already imposing on them. \nIV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise  \nin Violation of RFRA \n200.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n201.  RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s exercise \nof religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the Government \ndemonstrates that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that interest.  \n202.  RFRA protects organizations as well as individuals from Government-imposed \nsubstantial burdens on religious exercise. \n203.  RFRA applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law by any  \nbranch, department, agency, instrumentality, or official of the United States. \n204.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs.  \n205.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into their \nreligious beliefs. \n206.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n207.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n  49 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 50 of 63 PageID #:277\n \n208.  Requiring Plaintiffs to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate is not the least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  \n209.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate against \nPlaintiffs, Defendants have violated RFRA.  \n210.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n211.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT II \nSubstantial Burden on Religious Exercise in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \n212.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n213.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the Government from  \nsubstantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion. \n214.  The Free Exercise Clause protects organizations as well as individuals from \nGovernment-imposed burdens on religious exercise. \n215.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or \nfacilitate practices and speech that are contrary to their religious beliefs. \n216.  In order to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption to the U.S. \nGovernment Mandate, Plaintiffs must submit to an intrusive government inquiry into their \nreligious beliefs. \n217.  The U.S. Government Mandate substantially burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n218.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it is riddled with exemptions for which there is not a consistent, legally defensible basis.  \nIt offers multiple exemptions from its requirement that employer-based health plans include or \n  50 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 51 of 63 PageID #:278\n \nfacilitate coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraception, and related education \nand counseling.   \n219.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not a neutral law of general applicability \nbecause it discriminates against certain religious viewpoints and targets certain religious \norganizations for disfavored treatment.  Defendants enacted the U.S. Government Mandate \ndespite being aware of the substantial burden it would place on Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.     \n220.  The U.S. Government Mandate implicates constitutional rights in addition to the \nright to free exercise of religion, including, for example, the rights to free speech and to freedom \nfrom excessive government entanglement with religion. \n221.  The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Plaintiffs to \ncomply with the U.S. Government Mandate. \n222.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n223.  By enacting and threatening to enforce the U.S. Government Mandate, the \nGovernment has burdened Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of the Free Exercise Clause \nof the First Amendment.  \n224.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n225.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT III \nExcessive Entanglement in Violation of the  \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n226.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n  51 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 52 of 63 PageID #:279\n \n227.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nprohibit intrusive government inquiries into the religious beliefs of individuals and institutions, \nand other forms of excessive entanglement between religion and Government.  \n228.  This prohibition on excessive entanglement protects organizations as well as \nindividuals. \n229.  In order to qualify for the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate for \n“religious employers,” entities must submit to an invasive government investigation into an \norganization’s religious beliefs, including whether the organization’s “purpose” is  the \n“inculcation of religious values” and whether the organization “primarily employs” and \n“primarily serves” individuals who share the organization’s religious tenets. \n230.  The U.S. Government Mandate thus requires the Government to engage in \ninvasive inquiries and judgments regarding questions of religious belief or practice. \n231.  The U.S. Government Mandate results in an excessive entanglement between \nreligion and Government.  \n232.  The U.S. Government Mandate is therefore unconstitutional and invalid.  \n233.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  \n234.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n235.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT IV \nReligious Discrimination in Violation of the  \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n236.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n  52 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 53 of 63 PageID #:280\n \n237.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nmandate the equal treatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or \npreference.  \n238.  This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n239.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s narrow exemption for certain “religious \nemployers” but not others discriminates on the basis of religious views or religious status.  \n240.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer likewise \ndiscriminates among different types of religious entities based on the nature of those entities’ \nreligious beliefs or practices. \n241.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer furthers no \ncompelling governmental interest. \n242.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s definition of religious employer is not narrowly \ntailored to further a compelling governmental interest.  \n243.  The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  \n244.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n245.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an \nimmediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nCOUNT V \nInterference in Matters of Internal Church Governance in Violation of  \nthe Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment \n246.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n247.  The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause protect the freedom of \nreligious organizations to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernment as well as those of faith and doctrine.     \n  53 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 54 of 63 PageID #:281\n \n248.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, ministers, or \ndoctrine.   \n249.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n250.  Plaintiffs are religious organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.   \n251.  The Catholic Church views abortion, sterilization, and contraception as \nintrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from condoning or facilitating those \npractices.     \n252.  Plaintiffs have abided and must continue to abide by the decision of the Catholic \nChurch on these issues.     \n253.  The Government may not interfere with or otherwise question the final decision \nof the Catholic Church that its religious organizations must abide by these views.       \n254.  Plaintiffs have therefore made the internal decision that the health plans they offer \nto their employees may not cover, subsidize, or facilitate abortion, sterilization, or contraception. \n255.  The U.S. Government Mandate interferes with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \nconcerning their structure and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly \nconflict with Catholic beliefs. \n256.  The U.S. Government Mandate’s interference with Plaintiffs’ internal decisions \naffects their faith and mission by requiring them to facilitate practices that directly conflict with \ntheir religious beliefs.   \n  54 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 55 of 63 PageID #:282\n \n257.  Because the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with the internal decision-\nmaking of Plaintiffs in a manner that affects Plaintiffs’ faith and mission, it violates the \nEstablishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. \n258.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n259.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT VI \nCompelled Speech in Violation of  \nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \n260.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n261.  The First Amendment protects against the compelled affirmation of any religious \nor ideological proposition that the speaker finds unacceptable. \n262.  The First Amendment protects organizations as well as individuals against \ncompelled speech. \n263.  Expenditures are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. \n264.  The First Amendment protects against the use of a speaker’s money to support a \nviewpoint that conflicts with the speaker’s religious beliefs. \n265.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to provide health care \nplans to their employees that include or facilitate coverage of practices that violate their religious \nbeliefs.   \n266.  The U.S. Government Mandate would compel Plaintiffs to subsidize, promote, \nand facilitate education and counseling services regarding these practices. \n267.  By imposing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants are compelling Plaintiffs \nto publicly subsidize or facilitate the activity and speech of private entities that are contrary to \ntheir religious beliefs. \n  55 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 56 of 63 PageID #:283\n \n268.  The U.S. Government Mandate is viewpoint-discriminatory and subject to strict \nscrutiny. \n269.  The U.S. Government Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest.  \n270.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n271.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n272.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT VII \nFailure to Conduct Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking and Improper  \nDelegation in Violation of the APA \n273.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n274.  The Affordable Care Act expressly delegates to an agency within Defendant \nHHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the authority to establish guidelines \nconcerning the “preventive care” that a group health plan and health insurance issuer must \nprovide.   \n275.  Given this express delegation, Defendants were required to engage in formal \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law before issuing the guidelines that \ngroup health plans and insurers must cover.  Proposed regulations were required to be published \nin the Federal Register and interested persons were required to be given an opportunity to \nparticipate in the rulemaking through the submission of written data, views, or arguments. \n276.  Defendants promulgated the “preventive care” guidelines without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law.    \n277.  Defendants, instead, delegated their responsibilities for issuing preventive care \nguidelines to a non-governmental entity, the IOM.   \n  56 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 57 of 63 PageID #:284\n \n278.  The IOM did not permit or provide for the broad public comment otherwise \nrequired under the APA concerning the guidelines that it would recommend.  The dissent to the \nIOM report noted both that the IOM conducted its review in an unacceptably short time frame, \nand that the review process lacked transparency.         \n279.  Within two weeks of the IOM issuing its guidelines, Defendant HHS issued a \npress release announcing that the IOM’s guidelines were required under the Affordable Care \nAct.  \n280.  Defendants have never explained why they failed to enact these “preventive care” \nguidelines through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA. \n281.  Defendants also failed to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when issuing \nthe interim final rules and the final rule incorporating the guidelines.   \n282.  Defendants’ stated reasons for promulgating these rules without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking do not constitute “good cause.”  Providing public notice \nand an opportunity for comment was not impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest for the reasons claimed by Defendants. \n283.  By enacting the “preventive care” guidelines and interim and final rules through \ndelegation to a non-governmental entity and without engaging in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, Defendants failed to observe a procedure required by law and thus violated \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n284.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.   \n285.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n  57 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 58 of 63 PageID #:285\n \n286.  The enactment of the U.S. Government Mandate without observance of a \nprocedure required by law and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing \nharm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief.  \nCOUNT VIII \nArbitrary and Capricious Action in Violation of the APA \n287.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. \n288.  The APA condemns agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n289.  The APA requires that an agency examine the relevant data and articulate an \nexplanation for its action that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the \npolicy choice made. \n290.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious under the APA if the agency has failed \nto consider an important aspect of the problem before it. \n291.  A court reviewing agency action may not supply a reasoned basis that the agency \nitself has failed to offer. \n292.  Defendants failed to consider the suggestion of many commenters that abortion-\ninducing drugs, sterilization, or contraception could not be viewed as “preventive care.”   \n293.  Defendants failed adequately to engage with voluminous comments suggesting \nthat the scope of the religious exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate should be broadened. \n294.  Defendants did not articulate a reasoned basis for their action by drawing a \nconnection between facts found and the policy decisions they made. \n295.  Defendants failed to provide any standards or processes for how the \nAdministration will decide which religious institutions will be included in the religious \nexemption. \n  58 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 59 of 63 PageID #:286\n \n296.  Defendants failed to consider the use of broader religious exemptions in many \nother federal laws and regulations. \n297.  Defendants’ promulgation of the U.S. Government Mandate violates the APA. \n298.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile. \n299.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n300.  Defendants are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm on the Plaintiffs that \nwarrants relief. \nCOUNT IX \nActing Illegally in Violation of the APA \n301.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint.  \n302.  The APA requires that all Government agency action, findings, and conclusions \nbe “in accordance with law.”   \n303.  The U.S. Government Mandate and its exemption are illegal and therefore in \nviolation of the APA.   \n304.  The Weldon Amendment states that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services] may be \nmade available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or government \nsubjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the basis that the \nhealth care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.”  \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 \nStat. 786, 1111 (2011). \n305.  The Affordable Care Act states that “nothing in this title (or any amendment by \nthis title) shall be construed to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] \n  59 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 60 of 63 PageID #:287\n \nservices . . . as part of its essential health benefits for any plan year.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 18023(b)(1)(A)(i).  It adds that “the issuer of a qualified health plan shall determine whether or \nnot the plan provides coverage of [abortion.]”   Id. § 18023(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n306.  The Affordable Care Act contains no clear expression of an affirmative intention \nof Congress that employers with religiously motivated objections to the provision of health plans \nthat include coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, contraception, or related \neducation and counseling should be required to provide such plans. \n307.  The U.S. Government Mandate requires employer-based health plans to provide \ncoverage for abortion-inducing drugs, contraception, sterilization, and related education.  It does \nnot permit employers or issuers to determine whether the plan covers abortion, as the Act \nrequires.  By issuing the U.S. Government Mandate, Defendants have exceeded their authority, \nand ignored the direction of Congress. \n308.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates RFRA  \n309.  The U.S. Government Mandate violates the First Amendment. \n310.  The U.S. Government Mandate is not in accordance with law and thus violates 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n311.  Plaintiffs have no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the \nalternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.   \n312.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n313.  Defendants failure to act in accordance with law imposes an immediate and \nongoing harm on Plaintiffs that warrants relief. \nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL  \n  Plaintiffs hereby make demand for a trial by jury on all issues so triable. \n \n  60 \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 27 Filed: 08/08/12 Page 61 of 63 PageID #:288\n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n1.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiffs’ rights under RFRA; \n2.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  U.S.  Government  Mandate  violates \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the First Amendment; \n3.

Plaintiffs assert that because they\nare Catholic, religious entities and employers, the requirements of the ACA to provide\ncontraceptive, sterilization, and abortion services to employees violate Plaintiffs’\nsincerely held religious beliefs.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2-5.)    Specifically, Plaintiffs allege\nDefendants, in the enactment and enforcement of the ACA, violate the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 200-304.)  Defendants move to dismiss\nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing Plaintiffs\nlack standing, and that the matter is not ripe for adjudication.   For the reasons presented\nbelow, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted, and the Amended Complaint is\ndismissed without prejudice. \nBACKGROUND\nThe instant action is one of many filed across the country, challenging the legality\nof the ACA’s regulations regarding contraception and preventative care.  In granting a\nsimilar motion to dismiss on the basis of standing and ripeness, Judge Boasberg of the\nDistrict of D.C. provided a detailed explanation of the statutory history.  See Belmont\nAbbey College v. Sebelius, 878 F. Supp. 2d 25 (D.D.C. 2012) (Belmont Abbey).  The\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services enlisted the guidance of the\nInstitute of Medicine, a private health policy organization, to establish guidelines\nregarding preventative health care for the Health Resources and Services Administration\n2\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:615\n(“HRSA”).  The Institute of Medicine suggested, among other proposals, that insurance\nplans be required to cover contraceptives and sterilization procedures, including\nemergency contraceptives, such as the “morning-after” pill.  Id. at 29.  HRSA adopted\nthese proposed guidelines; and, on August 1, 2011, the Department of Health and Human\nServices, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Treasury (“the Departments”)\nissued an interim final rule, requiring group insurance plans to cover the preventative\nservices for women suggested by the Institute of Medicine.  Id. at 29-30 (quoting 76 Fed.\nReg. 46621; 45 C.F.R. § 147.130).  According to the federal regulation, all insurance\nplans and policies, unless specifically exempt, must provide women coverage for\ncontraceptive services, beginning on August 1, 2012, without any cost-sharing\nrequirements.  Id.  \nThe Departments acknowledged the impact on the religious beliefs of some\nreligious employers if they were required to cover contraceptive services.  Wheaton\nCollege v. Sebelius, No. 12-1169, 2012 WL 3637162, at *2 (Aug. 24, 2012 D.D.C.)\n(Wheaton College).  The interim final rule gave exemption to certain employers,\nincluding churches or religious orders, and other employers that meet the following\ncriteria:  \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the orga nization. \n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious\ntenets of the organization.  (3) The organization serves prim arily persons\nwho share the religious tenets of the organization.  (4) The organization is\na nonprofit organization as desc ribed in section 6033(a)(1) and section\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i)  or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended.\n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B).  The Departments invited comments to the interim\n3\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:616\nfinal rule, specifically with regards to the definition of religious employer, described\nabove.  In response to the comments received, the Departments stated the following:\n[T]he Departments are adopting the definition in the am ended interim\nfinal regulations for purposes of these final regulations while also creating\na  temporary  enforcement  safe harbor ,  discussed below. During the\ntemporary enforcement safe harbor, the Departments plan to develop and\npropose  changes to these final   regulations that would m eet  two\ngoals—providing  contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing   to\nindividuals who want it and accom modating non-exempted, non-profit\norganizations' religious objections to covering contraceptive services . . . .\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725.  The rule provides a one year “safe harbor” by which “certain non-\nexempted, non-profit organizations with religious objections to covering contraceptive\nservices” will not be held to be in violation of the regulations for failing to cover\ncontraceptive services.1  77 Fed. Reg. 8728.  The safe harbor remains in effect “until the\n1  To qualify for the safe harbor, an organization must meet the following criteria: \n \n1. The organization is organized and operates as a non-profit entity.\n2. From February 10, 2012 onward, the group health plan established or\nmaintained by the organization has consistently not provided all or the same\nsubset  of the contraceptive coverage otherwise requi red  at any point,\nconsistent with any applicable State law, because of the religious beliefs of\nthe organization.\n3. As detailed below, the group health plan established or maintained by the\norganization (or another entity on behalf of  the plan, such as a health\ninsurance issuer or third-party administrator) must provide to participants the\nattached  notice, as described below, which states that som e  or all\ncontraceptive coverage will not be provided under the plan for the first plan\nyear beginning on or after August 1, 2012.\n4. The organization self-certifies that it satisfies criteria 1-3 above, and\ndocuments its self-certification in accordance with the procedures detailed\nherein.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Guidance on the Temporary\nEnforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans and\nGroup  Health Insurance Issuers, at 3 (Aug. 15, 2012),  available  at\n4\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:617\nfirst plan year that begins on or after August 1, 2013.”  Belmont Abbey, 878 F. Supp. 2d\nat 31 (citation omitted).  During the safe harbor period, the Departments intend to\n“develop alternative ways of providing contraceptive coverage without cost sharing with\nrespect to non-exempted, non-profit religious organizations with religious objections to\nsuch coverage.”  77 Fed. Reg. 8728.  On March 21, 2012, the Departments issued an\n“Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” or “ANPRM,” whereby the Departments\nformally declared their intention to amend the final regulations, and invited additional\ncomments from the public and interested parties.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 16,501; Belmont\nAbbey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 31.  The Departments intend to finalize such amendments to\nthe final regulations prior to the end of the safe harbor period, August 1, 2013.  77 Fed.\nReg. 16,503.  \n“Plaintiffs are Catholic religious entities that provide a wide range of spiritual,\neducational, and social services” to Illinois residents, without regard to an individual’s\nreligious beliefs.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 2.)  Plaintiffs Diocese of Joliet and Diocese of\nSpringfield state they do not know if they will qualify as a “religious employer” under\nthe federal regulations.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiffs further state that Diocese of\nSpringfield’s and Catholic Charities Springfield’s health plan is grandfathered and that\nthose Plaintiffs are injured by their inability to change their plan as they see fit.  (Resp. at\n5.)  All Plaintiffs allege that the enactment of the federal regulations regarding coverage\nof preventative care would force Plaintiffs “to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to\nabortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception, or [require] Plaintiffs to submit\nhttp://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/prev-services-guidance-08152012.pdf. \n5\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:618\nto an intrusive governmental examination of their religious missions.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 8.) \nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, asserting that\nPlaintiffs’ suit should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, because\nPlaintiffs fail to allege an imminent injury, required to establish standing.  Defendants\nfurther contend that the case is not yet ripe for judicial review. \nLEGAL STANDARD\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) allows a party to raise as a defense, by\nmotion, a federal court’s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  “When reviewing a\ndismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction . . . the district court must accept as true\nall well-pleaded factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nplaintiff.”  St. John’s United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago, 502 F.3d 616, 625 (7th\nCir. 2007) (quoting Long v. Shorebank Dev. Corp., 182 F.3d 548, 554 (7th Cir. 1999)). \nHowever, when a defendant challenges subject-matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the\nburden of establishing jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561\n(1992) (Lujan).  \nA challenge of standing is a challenge to a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction;\nstanding is an essential jurisdictional requirement.  To establish standing, a plaintiff must\nshow:  a violation of a concrete, particularized legally protected interest; a causal\nrelationship between the defendant’s conduct and the injury to the plaintiff, and an injury\nwhich can be redressed if a court finds in the plaintiff's favor.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61. \nThe nonmoving party must support the basis of the jurisdiction with competent proof of\njurisdictional facts.  Kontos v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 826 F.2d 573, 576 (7th Cir. 1987). \n6\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:619\n“When considering a motion that launches a factual attack against jurisdiction, ‘[t]he\ndistrict court may properly look beyond the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint\nand view whatever evidence has been submitted on the issue to determine whether in fact\nsubject matter jurisdiction exists.’”  Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 572 F.3d\n440, 443 (7th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).  In establishing standing, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate the threat of an “‘injury in fact’ that is concrete and particularized; the threat\nmust be actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  American Civil Liberties\nUnion of Illinois v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 590 (7th Cir. 2012) (quoting Summers v. Earth\nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009)) (citations omitted).  Without a certainly\nimpending injury, standing does not exist.  Sierra Club v. Marita, 46 F.3d 606, 611 (7th\nCir. 1995) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. 564; Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990)\n(Whitmore)). \nChallenges to standing may be made prior to the enforcement of a law.  The\n“existence of a statute implies a threat to prosecute, so pre-enforcement challenges are\nproper, because a probability of future injury counts as ‘injury’ for the purpose of\nstanding.”  Bauer v. Shepard, 620 F.3d 704, 708 (7th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted)\n(Bauer).  \nA case may be challenged on the issue of ripeness, which, like the issue of\nstanding, stems from the U.S. Constitution’s case-or-controversy requirement.  Concerns\nof whether or not a case is ripe for adjudication can “arise when a case involves uncertain\nor contingent events that may not occur as anticipated, or not occur at all.”  Wisconsin\nRight to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Barland, 664 F.3d 139, 148 (7th Cir. 2011)\n7\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:620\n(Barland).  In determining if an issue is ripe for adjudication, a court considers:  (1) “the\nfitness of the issues for judicial decision” and (2) “the hardship to the parties of\nwithholding court consideration.”  Id. (citing Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res.\nConservation & Dev. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 201 (1983)). \nANALYSIS\nStanding\nDefendants contend Plaintiffs lack the requisite standing to pursue their claims\nbecause they do not allege an imminent injury resulting from the ACA and related\nfederal regulations.  Specifically, Defendants argue that because of the safe harbor\nprovision, “Defendants will not take any enforcement action against an organization that\nqualifies for safe harbor until the first plan year that begins on or after August 1, 2013.” \n(Mem. in Support of Defs.’ Mot. at 10.)  However, standing is not vitiated simply\nbecause the harm is not immediate, but rather likely to occur in the near future. \n“Standing depends on the probability of harm, not its temporal proximity.”  520 S.\nMichigan Ave. Associates, Ltd. v. Devine, 433 F.3d 961, 962 (7th Cir. 2006) (520 S.\nMichigan Ave.) (further noting “Courts frequently engage in pre-enforcement review\nbased on the potential cost that compliance (or bearing a penalty) creates.”).  The mere\nfact Plaintiffs are perhaps not harmed today does not destroy the parties’ standing; it is\nenough for Plaintiffs to demonstrate the probability of harm in the future.  See Bauer, 620\nF.3d at 708.  The safe harbor provision, on its face, simply delays the enforcement of the\ncontraceptive provisions as to Plaintiffs; the provision does not “reduce the certainty of\nthe impending injury.”  Belmont Abbey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 35.  \n8\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:621\nThough the safe harbor does not eliminate the possibility of an imminent injury\nfor purposes of standing, the ANPRM issued on March 21, 2012, does impact the likely\nimminence of Plaintiffs’ injuries.  The Government, in the ANPRM, made clear its intent\nto amend the regulations to address concerns, like that of Plaintiffs’, regarding employers\nwith religious objections to contraception.  77 Fed. Reg. 16,501.  The ANPRM further\nprovided that such amendments would be implemented prior to the end of the safe harbor\nprovision.  Id.  Moreover, government agencies are entitled to the presumption that they\nact in good faith, and no evidence has been presented to indicate the Departments will\nrenege on the statements made regarding amendment in the ANPRM.  See Starr v.\nFederal Aviation Administration, 589 F.2d 307, 315 (7th Cir. 1978).  With an amendment\nto the final regulations forthcoming, Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries regarding the enforcement\nof the current regulations are not “certainly impending.”  Belmont Abbey, 878 F. Supp. 2d\nat 37 (quoting Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 158.).  \nHowever, Plaintiffs also allege that, beyond the future impact at the expiration of\nthe safe harbor, the regulations also create present injuries.  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue\nthat the current regulations impact their ability to plan their future budgets, contending\nthat “if Plaintiffs are to comply with the law at the end of the safe harbor, they must\nbegin taking compliance measures now or bear the risk of being unprepared.”  (Resp. at\n10) (emphasis in original).  In support of this position, Plaintiffs rely in part upon the\nSeventh Circuit’s ruling in 520 S. Michigan Ave.  However, 520 S. Michigan Ave. is\nreadily distinguishable from the facts at issue here.  In 520 S. Michigan Ave., an\nemployer believed a credible threat of criminal prosecution existed if it failed to comply\n9\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:622\nwith a law, and no promises were made regarding the non-enforcement of the law.  520\nS. Michigan Ave., 433 F.3d at 963-64.  Here, the Government has clearly indicated that\nthe present regulations will be amended.  Therefore, any present injuries incurred by\nPlaintiffs as a result of their planning for the future, in response to regulations they know\nwill be amended, are of their own making.  Plaintiffs assert that the possibility of a\nchange (or lack thereof) in a regulation causes Plaintiffs immediate harm, because that\npossibility affects their ability to plan for the future.  Those claims of present injury are\nremote and based in conjecture; the claims do not establish an actual, concrete harm\nrequired to confer standing to Plaintiffs.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\nThus, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction on the basis of standing is granted.\nRipeness\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for adjudication.  The ripeness\ndoctrine prevents a court from engaging in a premature adjudication of an issue,\nparticularly when an administrative decision is not yet final.  See National Park\nHospitality Association v. Department of the Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-808 (2003)\n(National Park).  The doctrine prevents courts “from entangling themselves in abstract\ndisagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial\ninterference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a\nconcrete way by the challenging parties.”  Id. (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,\n387 U.S. 136, 148–149 (1967) overruled on other grounds (Abbott Labs); Califano v.\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977)). \n10\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:623\nIn determining if an issue is ripe for adjudication, a court considers:  (1) “the\nfitness of the issues for judicial decision” and (2) “the hardship to the parties of\nwithholding court consideration.”  National Park, 538 U.S. at 808.  Defendants argue\nPlaintiffs’ claims are not yet ripe because the promised accommodations regarding\nreligious objections mean the current regulations are not truly final, rendering any\njudicial decision as to the legality of the current regulations premature.  Plaintiffs counter\nthat the regulations are “final rules” and, therefore, fit for pre-enforcement review. \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ position ignores the reality that the Government stated its intention\nin the ANPRM to amend the regulations and that the Government further represented the\namendment was impending at oral argument.  Hence, it is possible that the forthcoming\namendments will eliminate the need for judicial review or, at the very least, impact the\nscope of Plaintiffs’ claims.  The ANPRM demonstrates that the challenged regulations\nare not “sufficiently final” and, therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for judicial\nreview.  See Belmont Abbey, 878 F. Supp. 2d at 39.  \nLikewise, the hardship to Plaintiffs if the Court does not adjudicate their claims is\ninsufficient to overcome the requirement that the claims be fit for final review.  As\ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs argue they cannot properly plan for the future, particularly\nwith regards to their budgets, due to the current state of the regulations.  However, their\nclaims of uncertainty do not meet the hardship requirement necessary to make their\nclaims ripe for adjudication.  The current regulations, considering the forthcoming\namendments, do not have a direct impact on Plaintiffs’ day-to-day operations, despite\nPlaintiffs’ allegation that the current regulations somehow already inhibit their ability to\n11\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-03932 Document #: 54 Filed: 02/08/13 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:624\nhire employees, attract students, and solicit charitable contributions.  (Am. Compl. ¶\n164.)  See Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. EPA, 536 F.2d 156, 162-163 (7th Cir. 1976) (finding\nplaintiffs’ “claims of uncertainty in their business and capital planning are not sufficient\nto warrant our review of an ongoing administrative process. . . . the claims are vague and\nspeculative.”).  The necessity to postpone judicial review of Plaintiffs’ claims until the\nDepartments have finalized the amended regulations outweighs the purported hardship to\nPlaintiffs in their ability to plan for contingencies.  See Belmont Abbey, 878 F. Supp. 2d\nat 41.  \nTherefore, in addition to failing to assert standing necessary to establish subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, the claims alleged by Plaintiffs are unripe for adjudication.   \nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction [31] is granted, and Plaintiff’s\nComplaint is dismissed without prejudice.  The merits of the current preventative care\nregulations or proposed amended regulations cannot be reached.  \nDate:  February 8, 2013 ______________________________\nJOHN W.
