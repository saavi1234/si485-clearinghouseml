Schneiderman today announced agreements with three major retail \nchains to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to the merchandise, services, and \namenities provided by each oftheir New York based stores. Under the statewide agreements, Century 21, \nJCPenney, and Petland Discounts will take significant steps to ensure that each of their New York stores \ncomplies with the accessibility requirements and design standards set forth by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA). \n''Ensuring that people with disabilities are provided the same retail shopping experience that other \ncustomers enjoy helps make the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act a reality,\" said Attorney \nGeneral Schneiderman. 'My office is committed to combating discrimination faced by people with \ndisabilities, and to helping promote accessibility across our state. I commend Century 21, JCPenney, and \nPetland Discounts for agreeing to take the steps necessary to make their stores fully accessible for all New \nYorkers.\" \nThese cases are part of Attorney General Schneiderman's ongoing investigation into the accessibility of \nretail establishments and other public accommodations for individuals with disabilities. The Attorney \nGeneral deployed undercover investigators and retained experts to examine Century 21, JCPenney, and \nPetland Discounts stores to determine if they comply with state and federal accessibility laws. Based on the \nundercover investigation and architectural surveys of the stores, the Attorney General's office identified \nnumerous impediments and barriers for people with disabilities. \nUnder the agreements, the three retailers have agreed to: \n> \nretain an independent ADA compliance consultant, approved by the Attorney General's office, to assist \nwith the implementation and enforcement of the agreements; \n> \nconduct a survey of every store located in New York to identify changes necessary to achieve \ncompliance with state and federal accessibility standards; \n> \nconform all elements of each store that deviate from state and federal accessibility laws; \n> \ntrain employees on the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and on the protocols used to \nafford people with disabilities equal access to the goods, services, and accommodations afforded to \npeople without disabilities; and \n> \ncertify that all new construction complies with state and federal accessibility laws and standards. \nCentury 21, JCPenney, and Petland Discounts also have agreed to pay a total of$120,00o to New York \nWNN.ag.ny.gl>lpr. ...r eleasalag·schneiderll'llID-secur. ..a greemenls·cen!ury-21·jcpenney-and-peliand-ciscaJnls.ensure  112 \n\n6114113  AG.

Although the ADA was enacted twenty years ago, wheelchair users, including our members \nand disabled veterans, still find themselves being barred from accessing many retail stores. Access for \npeople with disabilities is required by law. With these agreements, Attorney General Schneiderman not \nonly has ensured access for thousands ofindividuals, but has put retailers on notice that violations ofthe \nADA and other accessibility laws will not be tolerated in New York.\" \nPaula Wolf, President of Disabled in Action, said ''I applaud Attorney General Schneiderman for his \ncommitment to the civil rights of all New Yorkers. Ensuring compliance with federal and state accessibility \nlaws removes barriers to access for countless New Yorkers. Compliance with the ADA is not just the law, \nbut is good for business by increasing the number of potential customers and improving the shopping \nexperience for all.\" \nThese cases are being handled by Assistant Attorneys General Brooke P. Davis and Sunita Kini-Tandon, \nunder the supervision of Civil Rights Bureau Chief Kristen Clarke, Chief Counsel for Civil Rights Spencer \nFreedman, and Executive Deputy Attorney General for Social Justice Janet Sabel. \nThe Civil Rights Bureau of the Attorney General's Office is committed to combating discrimination faced by \nand promoting accessibility for individuals with disabilities across New York State.
