    "summary": "<p>On December 4, 2008, a class of pregnant women who gave birth while incarcerated in the Cook County Jail in Chicago, Illinois, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Cook County in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that their Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and state law had been violated. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that defendants' policy of shackling pregnant women to their birthing tables for several days surrounding birth, without breaks to walk or use the bathroom, violated the women’s constitutional rights.</p><p>Between December 2007 and December 2008, the Cook County Jail transported pregnant female prisoners to Stronger Hospital when they went into labor. The Sheriff allowed the practice of shackling women to their obstetric tables before, during, and after birthing. The purported justification for this practice was the repeated escape attempts of mothers during childbirth. The plaintiffs alleged that this practice not only endangered the health of the mother and child, but also led to indignity and humiliation for the mothers because the shackles would not be removed for any purpose, forcing mothers to soil the beds. This practice, plaintiffs claimed, also greatly increased the chances of infection. One plaintiff had been shackled for two days to the hospital bed. Another plaintiff was shackled to the bed, without permission to use the bathroom or to leave for five days. Other class representatives alleged similar experiences involving shackling between December 2007 and December 2008.</p><p>On December 9, 2009, the court (Judge Amy J. St. Eve) denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, finding that the proposed plaintiffs did not fulfill the adequacy of representation requirement for class action certification. The court also found that class action would not be superior to other available methods for adjudicating the controversy. The plaintiffs attempted to bring an interlocutory appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, but the court denied leave to appeal on March 23, 2010. </p><p>On May 10, 2010, after the plaintiffs' attorneys filed a myriad of individual claims against Cook County, the plaintiffs made an amended motion to certify a class. The Court certified the class on June 22, 2010.  Thereafter, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim. The defendants argued that supervisory liability could not attach unless the plaintiffs could prove that the Sheriff was personally involved in enforcement of the policy. </p><p>The court denied the defendants' Motion to Dismiss on December 29, 2010. The court found that the plaintiffs' allegations in the complaint were sufficient in alleging that the defendant Sheriff knew of and was involved in the enforcement of the shackling policy sometime after December 2007. Thereafter the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p><p>On December 20, 2011, the Court granted the defendant Sheriff's motion for summary judgment as to damages against him in his individual capacity but denied the defendants and plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment on the Substantive Due Process and state law negligence claims.  </p><p>Following a series of settlement conferences, the plaintiffs submitted a settlement agreement to the court for approval on May 17, 2012. The agreement provided that a total settlement fund of $4.1 million would resolve all class liability for the shackling policy and would be allocated to class members via a point distribution system that took account of the nature and duration of the shackling each class member endured.   </p><p>On August 30, 2012, Judge St. Eve approved the settlement and the court dismissed the case without prejudice with leave to reinstate by August 30, 2013. Judge St. Eve granted the plaintiff's motion to expedite first payout to class members.</p><p>At the conclusion of all settlement payments, almost $900,000 remained in the settlement fund. So, on December 14, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to close out administration, requesting the remaining funds be used for a substance abuse and mental health treatment program for women. Within the Cook County Circuit Court, Haymarket Center and the Maternal Objectives Management (MOMS) program oversaw such programs. The defendant refused to release the remaining funds, and so the Haymarket Center filed a motion to intervene on September 22, 2017, arguing entitlement to the funds as part of the settlement agreement. </p><p>On October 19, 2017, Judge St. Eve granted the defendant's motion for relief and denied the Haymarket Center's motion for intervention and enforcement. As Cook County cancelled the contract with Haymarket Center in September 2016, any such funds diverted to the Haymarket Center would not be allocated to members of the class. Instead, Judge St. Eve ruled that the defendant could retain the money in a special fund to provide in-house treatment and counseling services for women in Cook County custody.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed a motion on October 31, 2017 requesting reconsideration and a stay of judgment regarding Judge St. Eve's order granting defendant's relief. On April 9, 2018, Judge St. Eve granted the motion for reconsideration and denied the plaintiffs' motion for a stay as moot. The Court held that it had failed to properly incorporate the terms of the settlement agreement in its 2012 dismissal of the case, and therefore lacked jurisdiction to alter the settlement agreement—even though the County had ended its contract with Haymarket. Thus, the defendants were required to comply with the Payout Procedure of the settlement and allocate the remaining settlement funds to Haymarket. The case is now closed.</p>",

Gallagher, and pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, move this Honorable Court to dismiss Plaintiffs‟ Second Amended Complaint for the \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted against Sheriff Dart in his individual \ncapacity. In support thereof, the Defendant states as follows: \nIntroduction \n  Plaintiffs1 bring this action under the Civil Rights Act, Title 42 Section 1983 of the \nUnited  States  Code  against  Cook  County  Sheriff  Thomas  Dart  in  his  individual  capacity. \n                                                 \n1 Catherine Zaborowski, Simone Jackson, Nicole Blair, Lisa Brown, Danielle Bryant, Isabel Carmona, Marianne Cruz, Cora \nFletcher, Denae Johnson, Deborah Lee, Felicia Ligon, Angela Oss, Sheena Richardson, Bennetta Sidney, Monique Starnes, and \nLatania Walton. \n \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:958\n(Second Amended Complaint p.1-2). In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Sheriff Dart personally \n“adopted and implemented” an official policy of restraining female pre-trial detainees at the \nCook County Department of Corrections (CCDOC) “before, during, and immediately after labor \nand delivery” in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. Id. at 1, \n6).  \n  However, Plaintiffs‟ claims against Sheriff Dart are exactly the “[t]hreadbare recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements” that should be \ndismissed pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(6). Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009); see \nBrooks v. Ross, 578 F.3d 574, 581 (7th Cir. 2009). Plaintiffs‟ assertions are especially baseless \nwhere  the  parties  have  engaged  in  extensive  discovery  regarding  Sheriff  Dart‟s  alleged \ninvolvement in the “adopti[on] and implement[ation]” of the above policy. This discovery has \nincluded  four  (4)  FRCP  30(b)(6)  depositions  of  CCDOC  supervising  personnel  and  sworn \ninterrogatories answered by Sheriff Dart himself, all of which establish that Sheriff Dart did not \nhave  personal  involvement  in  the  adoption  or  implementation  of  these  alleged  policies. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action against Sheriff Dart in his individual \ncapacity and Plaintiffs‟ Second Amended Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice. \nStandard of Review \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6) a claim may be dismissed if, as a matter of law, “it is clear that no \nrelief  could  be  granted  under  any  set  of  facts  that  could  be  proved  consistent  with  the \nallegations.”Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989); quoting Hishon v. King & Spaulding, \n467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984). In reviewing a motion to dismiss, a district court‟s review is limited to \nthe four corners of the complaint. Gomez v. Illinois State Bd. of Ed., 811 F.2d 1030, 1039 (7th \nCir. 1987). The court should take the well-plead factual allegations of the complaint and view \nthem, as well as reasonable inferences drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:959\nPlaintiff. Gutierrez v. Peters, 111 F.3d 1364, 1369 (7th Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, while a district \ncourt will dismiss a complaint when no relief can be granted under a set of facts consistent with \nthe allegations, the court should not strain to find inferences not plainly apparent from the face of \nthe complaint. Hishon, 467 U.S. at 73. Furthermore, it should be noted that “litigants may plead \nthemselves out of court by alleging facts that may establish defendants‟ entitlement to prevail.” \nBennett v. Schmidt, 153 F.3d 516, 519 (7th Cir. 1998). \n \nPlaintiffs Fail to Allege A Cause of Action Against Defendant Thomas Dart in \nhis Individual Capacity \n \n  To  hold  a  defendant  individually  liable  for  damages  due  to  alleged  constitutional \ndeprivations, substantive allegations of personal involvement on the part of the defendant must \nbe stated. Potter v. Clark, 497 F.2d 1206 (7th Cir. 1974). The Seventh Circuit reaffirmed that “an \nindividual cannot be held liable in a § 1983 action unless he caused or participated in an alleged \nconstitutional deprivation.” Moore v. State of Indiana, 999 F.2d 1125, 1129 (7th Cir. 1993); \nciting  Wolf-Lillie  v.  Sonquist,  699  F.2d  864,  869  (7th  Cir.  1983)(emphasis  in  original).  A \nPlaintiff must demonstrate that the official “knowingly, willfully, or at least recklessly caused the \nalleged deprivation by his action or his failure to act.” Rascon v. Hardiman, 803 F.2d 269, 274 \n(7th Cir. 1986). A defendant cannot be held liable by virtue of his employment or supervision of \nindividuals who are alleged to have engaged in unconstitutional conduct. Rizzo v. Goode, 423 \nU.S. 362, 377 (1976).  \n  Because the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply in § 1983 actions, it is not \nenough for plaintiff to allege wrongdoing on the part of defendant's subordinates. See Jones v. \nCity of Chicago, 856 F.2d 985, 992 (7th Cir. 1988). Vicarious liability is insufficient to hold the \nemployer or supervisor responsible merely because of his position. Monell v. New York City \nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). \"An official satisfies the personal \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:960\nresponsibility  requirement  of  Section  1983  [only]  if  the  conduct  causing  the  constitutional \ndeprivation occurs at his direction or with his knowledge and consent.\" Gentry v. Duckworth, 65 \nF.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995). \"[S]upervisors must know about the conduct and facilitate it, \napprove it, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might see. Id. \"In short, some \ncausal connection or affirmative link between the action complained about and the official sued \nis necessary for § 1983 recovery.\" Id. at 561.  \nIn 2007, the Supreme Court retooled its interpretation of the pleading standards in the \ncontext of a motion to dismiss. See Twombly, 550 U.S. 553-554, 558-559. In Twombly, the Court \nstated that the \"plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires \nmore than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action \nwill not do.\" Id. at 553-556 (brackets omitted). The Court found that the plaintiffs‟ assertion of \nan unlawful violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act was a “legal conclusion.” Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009). The Court further found that plaintiff‟s nonconclusory \n“factual allegation of parallel behavior … did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it \nwas  not  only  compatible  with,  but  indeed  was  more  likely  explained  by,  lawful, \nunchoreographed free-marked behavior.” Id. citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567.  \nThe Court went on to find that the factual allegations in the complaint \"must be enough to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level.\" Id. at 1965. In so holding, Twombly retired the \noft-quoted statement from Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957), \nthat a complaint survives a motion to dismiss \"unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff \ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 560-561; quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46; see Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1944. \nMore recently in Iqbal, the Supreme Court explained the FRCP 8 pleading requirements \nin the context of Biven and Section 1983 claims against government officials in their individual \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:961\nand  official  capacities.  Iqbal,  129  S.  Ct.  1940.  In  particular,  Iqbal  alleged  that  defendants \nAttorney General Ashcroft and Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) Director Mueller “agreed \nto subject him to harsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discriminatory \nfactors”  and  that  “Ashcroft  was  that  policy‟s  „principal  architect‟;  and  that  Mueller  was \n“instrumental‟ in its adoption and execution.” Id. at 1939.  However, the Court found that these \nclaims were “conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.” Id. at 1940. The Iqbal  opinion \nfurther explained that while a court \"must accept the factual allegations in the pleadings as true\" \nand must liberally construe the claims in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the courts \"are \nnot bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\" Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 561, Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-1950. \nThe Iqba Court based this holding on two “working principles” underlying the Court‟s \ndecision in Twombly. Id. at 1949.  First, a court‟s requirement to accept true all of the allegations \ncontained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions because “[t]hreadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id.  \nSecond, only a complaint that states a “plausible claim” can survive a motion to dismiss. Id. at \n1949-1950.  Specifically, the Court stated: \nDetermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the \nCourt of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-\npleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of \nmisconduct, the complaint has alleged – but it has not „show[n]‟ – „that the \npleader is entitled to relief.” [internal citations omitted]. Id. citing Fed. Rule. Civ. \nProc. 8(a)(2).  \n \nSee also Brooks v. Ross, 578 F.3d 574 (7th Cir. 2009)(The Seventh Circuit held that plaintiff‟s \nallegation  below  “fail[ed]  under  Iqbal[‘s]”  pleading  requirement  “because  it  is  merely  a \nformulaic recitation of the cause of action and nothing more.” \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:962\n“Plaintiff is informed, believes and alleges that the Defendants while acting in \nconcert  with  other  State  of  Illinois  officials  and  employees  of  the  Attorney \nGeneral's Office, Department of Corrections and Prisoner Review Board did \nknowingly,  intentionally  and  maliciously  prosecute  Plaintiff  and  Ronald \nMatrisciano in retaliation for Plaintiff and the said Ronald Matrisciano exercising \nrights and privileges under the Constitutions and laws of the United States and \nState of Illinois”. \n \nsee also Walton v. Walker Jr. et. al., 364 Fed. Appx. 256, 258; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 2338 *4 \n(7th Cir. February 3, 2010)(Plaintiff‟s 82 page complaint-and the 184 pages of exhibits that \naccompany it-“contain nothing more than unsupported allegations that a wide variety of state and \nlocal officials over many months conspired to violate his rights.” Plaintiff‟s complaint only \nmakes \"‟[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements,‟  and  these  are  just  the  sort  of  „naked  assertions‟  that  the  Supreme  Court  has \ncounseled are not sufficient to avoid dismissal.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949; see Brooks v. Ross, \n578 F.3d 574, 581 (7th Cir. 2009). \nIn the present case, Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts to support the conclusion that \nSheriff Dart personally “adopted and implemented” a policy of restraining female detainees \n“before, during, and immediately after labor and delivery” in violation of their constitutional \nrights. (Second Amended Complaint p.4). Instead, Plaintiffs‟ allegations are exactly the type of \n“threadbare recitals of the elements” that are insufficient to state a claim against Defendant in his \nindividual capacity. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-1950. Instead of providing factual support for their \nclaims, Plaintiffs provide “conclusory statements” regarding Sheriff Dart‟s participation in the \nadoption and implementation of the CCDOC‟s alleged policy of restraining detainees during \nlabor and delivery. (Second Amended Complaint 7-8, 11-12) \n  Plaintiffs have also been involved in extensive discovery regarding Sheriff Dart‟s alleged \ninvolvement in the adoption and implementation of the CCDOC‟s “shackling” policy. In fact, \nPlaintiffs have deposed four supervising personnel from the CCDOC. These four depositions \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:963\nhave consisted of 352 pages of testimony regarding the Sheriff‟s policy, practice or custom \nregarding  restraining  pregnant  detainees,  and  more  importantly,  Sheriff‟s  Dart  personal \ninvolvement in the creation and implementation of these policies, practices, or customs. In each \nand  every  one  of  these  depositions,  the  witnesses  have  testified  that  Sheriff  Dart  was  not \ninvolved in  the creation,  implementation, or supervision of the CCDOC‟s policy regarding \nrestraining female detainees during labor or delivery.  \n  Moreover, Plaintiffs received Sheriff Dart‟s sworn answers to their interrogatories in the \nmatter of Deborah Lee v. Thomas J. Dart et. al., 09 CV 7789. Those interrogatories and answers \nprovided in part:  \nInterrogatory 2: State whether Defendant Dart had personal knowledge of the \nwritten policies, procedures, and/or practices relating to guarding or providing \nsecurity for detainees while they are patients at a hospital, including but not \nlimited to the practice or policy of restraining and/or shackling detainees to \nhospital beds during the period from December 1, 2004 through December of \n2009. \n \nAnswer:  … Sheriff Dart is aware that detainees are guarded and require \nsecurity upon being transported to and while at hospitals outside of the Cook \nCounty Department of Corrections. However, Sheriff Dart is unaware of the \nspecific procedures and means by which officers ensure detainees are transported \nand secured. Finally, although Sheriff Dart did not personally participate in the \nspecific contents, creation, or implementation of such documents, the Cook \nCounty Department of Corrections relies on… Sheriff Dart is aware that security \nof detainees at a hospital, in general, consists of general requirements that such \nsecurity prevent escape of detainees, maintain the safety to the community and \nindividuals at said hospital, and that security is provided in accordance with any \napplicable laws. Moreover, Sheriff Dart was aware that any security should act, in \nmanaging security concerns, in accordance with any appropriate physicians‟ \norders and each detainee‟s medical needs.  \n \nTherefore, Plaintiffs conclusory pleadings are precisely those prohibited by Iqbal, and their \nclaims against Sheriff Dart in his individual capacity should be dismissed. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 140 Filed: 10/12/10 Page 8 of 8 PageID #:964\nCONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE, for the above stated reasons, Defendant Sheriff Thomas Dart  is entitled \nto  dismissal  as  a  matter  of  law  under  F.R.C.P.  12(b)(6),  and  respectfully  request  that  the \nHonorable Court dismiss with prejudice, Plaintiffs‟ Second Amended Complaint and all claims \ntherein against Defendant Sheriff Thomas Dart in his individual capacity.   \n \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nANITA ALVAREZ \nState's Attorney of Cook County \n \n \n/s/ Michael L.

The class \nseeks to impose liability on the Sheriff in his official capacity. Plaintiffs \nBlair,  Brown,  Bryant,  Carmona,  Cruz,  Farrar,  Fletcher,  Johnson,  Lee, \nLigon,  Oss,  Richardson,  Sidney,  Starnes,  and  Walton  seek  to  impose \nliability on the Sheriff in his individual capacity. Now before the Court is \nthe Sheriff’s motion to dismiss the individual capacity claim. The Court \nshould deny this motion for the reasons set out below. \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 2 of 24 PageID #:974\nI.  Plaintiffs’ Theory of Individual Liability \nThomas J. Dart became the Sheriff of Cook County in December of \n2006. (Second Amended Complaint, pars. 4, 5(b).) Rather than working \nfrom the loop office of his predecessor, Dart moved his office to the Cook \nCounty Jail, publicly declaring that “The jail is 90 percent of the job.”1 \nDart explained that “The day in and day out things that impact our office \nthat require decisions, and quick ones, are from out there.”  \nUpon  becoming  Sheriff,  Dart  promptly  instituted  a  variety  of \nchanges at the jail, installing new technologies, including introducing body-\nscanning machines to prevent contraband from entering the jail, while also \nraising standards for employment. (Second Amended Complaint, par. 5(a).) \nDart  applied  a  “hands  on”  style  of  management,  and  held  weekly \n“accountability  meetings,”  during  which  all  high  ranking  Jail  staffers \nprovide him with detailed reports on activities in their respective divisions \nof  the  Jail.  (Second  Amended  Complaint,  par.  5(b).  Dart  formed  a \n“Weapons Free Committee” to collect, inventory, and analyze all inmate-\n                                              \n1 Plaintiffs advance this and the following contention in accordance with the \nSeventh Circuit’s rule that, in responding to a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff may \n“suggest facts outside the pleading, including on appeal, to show that a complaint \nshould not be dismissed.” Reynolds v. CB Sports Bar, Inc., 623 F.3d 1143, 1147 \n(7th Cir. 2010). (The quotation appeared in the Chicago Tribune on December 2, \n2006. ) \n-2- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 3 of 24 PageID #:975\nmade shanks and weapons. (Second Amended Complaint, par. 5(c).) Dart \nalso formed a “blue ribbon” committee of former U.S. Attorneys and other \nlegal and law enforcement experts to evaluate the Sheriff’s internal affairs \noperations. (Second Amended Complaint, par. 5(d).) \nIn addition to this involvement in the everyday running of the jail, \nDart selected and hired a consultant to train correctional officers on how to \nbetter recognize and supervise inmates with mental health issues. (Second \nAmended Complaint, par. 5(e).) Dart also changed Jail policy to permit \ncontact  visits  between  female  detainees  and  their  children.  (Second \nAmended  Complaint,  par.  5(f).)  Moreover,  Dart  became  personally \ninvolved in the operation of the 13,000 square foot garden located on the \ngrounds of the Cook County Jail that is used to train detainees in urban \nfarming. (Second Amended Complaint, par. 5(g).) \nAt  the  same  time  that  he  adopted  and  implemented  these \nprogressive policies, Dart permitted the continuation of an official policy \n(hereinafter “shackling policy”) requiring correctional officers to shackle \npregnant woman before, during, and immediately after labor and delivery. \n(Second Amended Complaint, par. 6.) The shackling policy violates clearly \nestablished federal law (Second Amended Complaint, par. 10), as well as \n-3- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 4 of 24 PageID #:976\nthe  express  terms  of  an  Illinois  statute,  55  ILCS  5/3-15003.6  (Second \nAmended Complaint, par. 8.) \nDart learned about the shackling policy some time after December 1, \n2007. (Second Amended Complaint, par. 10(b).) Notwithstanding his actual \nknowledge of the unlawful and unconstitutional practices, Dart sought to \nconceal  the  unlawful  policy  by  making  false  public  statements  that \nshackling  was  necessary  because  many  female  detainees  have  escaped \nfrom  custody  during  childbirth.  (Second  Amended  Complaint,  par.  12.) \nDart also made false public statement that Illinois law permits shackling a \ndetainee before, during, and after childbirth. Id.  \nAlthough  Dart  eventually  took  remedial  action  to  change  the \nunlawful  shackling  practices  (Second  Amended  Complaint,  par.  13), \nplaintiffs were each subjected to the shackling policy because Dart failed \n“to  intervene  and  take  action  to  correct  the  unlawful  policy  after  he \nacquired personal knowledge that, notwithstanding clearly settled federal \nlaw  and  the  unambiguous  state  statute,  female  detainees  were  being \nshackled before, during, and after childbirth. Id. \nPlaintiffs fairly allege in their second amended complaint that Dart \nknew about the unconstitutional shackling policy and that, as Sheriff, he \n-4- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 5 of 24 PageID #:977\nhad the ability to change that policy. Plaintiffs have therefore stated a \nSection 1983 claim against Dart in his individual capacity.2 \nFor more than 25 years, the law has been clearly established that \nthe official in charge of the Cook County Jail is responsible for violations of \nconstitutional rights that occur with his (or her) “knowledge and consent.”  \nAn official satisfies the personal responsibility requirement \nof section 1983 if she acts or fails to act with a deliberate or \nreckless disregard of plaintiff's constitutional rights, or if \nthe conduct causing the constitutional deprivation occurs at \nher direction or with her knowledge and consent. \nRascon v. Hardiman, 803 F.2d 269, 274 (7th Cir. 1986) \nDefendant acknowledges Rascon (Def.Mem. 3), but cites it for the \nproposition  that  plaintiffs  must  show  that  defendant  acted  “knowingly, \nwillfully, or at least recklessly.” Id. Defendant, however, omits the final \nclause of the quoted excerpt from Rascon — the language that recognizes \nliability when “the conduct causing the constitutional deprivation occurs as \nher direction or with her knowledge and consent.”  \nThe Seventh Circuit has repeatedly reaffirmed the Rascon standard \nfor individual liability. See, e.g., Del Raine v. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1052 \n                                              \n2 Plaintiffs’ theory of liability is analogous to a § 1983 claim against a police officer \nwho failed “to intervene to prevent a false arrest or the use of excessive force if \nthe officer is informed of the facts that establish a constitutional violation and has \nthe ability to prevent it.” Montano v. City of Chicago, 535 F.3d 558, 569 (7th Cir. \n2008), quoting Morfin v. City of East of Chicago, 349 F.3d 989, 1001 (7th Cir. \n2003). \n-5- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 6 of 24 PageID #:978\n(7th Cir. 1994); McPhaul v. Board of Commissioners of Madison County, \n226 F.3d 558, 566 (7th Cir. 2000). As this Court stated in Nicol v. Lavin, \nN.D.Ill., 03-cv-6688, Mem.Op., Aug 13, 2004, 11): “Refining the inquiry as \nto a supervisory official, Plaintiff need not allege ‘direct participation’ but \nmerely  acts  or  omissions  at  [defendant’s]  ‘direction,’  with  [defendant’s] \n‘knowledge and consent,’ or exhibiting [defendant’s] ‘deliberate or reckless \ndisregard’  for  Plaintiff's  constitutional  rights.”  Nicol  v.  Lavin,  supra, \nattached as Exhibit 1.) \nDefendant bases his motion to dismiss on a misreading of Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009) (Def.Mem. 4-6), and on the meritless theory \nthat  a  complaint  should  be  dismissed  under  Rule  12(b)(6)  because  the \ndefendant has denied wrongdoing in pre-trial discovery. (Def.Mem. 6-7.) \nPlaintiffs respond to these arguments below. \nII.  The Complaint Meets the Iqbal Standard \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint \nmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.’” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Such well-pleaded \nfacts  “permit  the  court  to  infer  more  than  the  mere  possibility  of \nmisconduct.” Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1950. \n-6- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 7 of 24 PageID #:979\nDefendant’s  Iqbal  argument  consists  of  the  somewhat  misleading \nassertion that the second amended complaint fails to allege “that Sheriff \nDart personally ‘adopted and implemented’ a policy of restraining female \ndetainees  ‘before,  during,  and  immediately  after  labor  and  delivery’  in \nviolation  of  their  constitutional  rights.  (Def.Mem.  6.)  Plaintiffs  do  not, \nhowever, seek to impose liability on Dart because he “personally adopted \nand implemented” the shackling policy. As set out above, plaintiffs’ theory \nof the case is that Dart knew about the shackling practices and that Dart \nallowed  those  practices  to  continue  with  his  “knowledge  and  consent.” \nRascon v. Hardiman, 803 F.2d at 274. \nThe Seventh Circuit recently recognized in T.E. v. Grindle, 599 F.3d \n583  (7th  Cir.  2010)  that  Iqbal  does  not  bar  a  claim  that  a  supervisory \nofficial is liable when he (or she) “creat[es] an atmosphere that allowed \nabuse to flourish.” Id. at 590. The Court there concluded that “When a \nstate  actor’s  deliberate  indifference  deprives  someone  of  his  or  her \nprotected  liberty  interest  in  bodily  integrity,  that  actor  violates  the \nConstitution,  regardless  of  whether  the  actor  is  a  supervisor  or \nsubordinate, and the actor may be held liable for the resulting harm.” Id. at \n591.  \n-7- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 8 of 24 PageID #:980\nPlaintiffs  discussed  in Part I of  this memorandum their detailed, \nspecific allegations of Dart’s personal involvement in the running of the \nJail,  as  well  as  plaintiffs’  allegations  that,  after  learning  about  the \nshackling  policy,  Dart  allowed  those  practices  to  continue.  These \nallegations are sufficiently detailed and meet the Iqbal standard. \nIII.  The Sheriff’s Representations about Discovery Are \nNot Material to Whether the Complaint States a Claim \n Defendant  makes  a  variety  of  representations  about  information \ndisclosed in discovery (Def.Mem. 2, 6-7), and argues that the Court should \nconsider his denials about involvement in the “creation, implementation, or \nsupervision” of the shackling policy in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss. (Def.Mem. 6-7.) The Court should swiftly reject these arguments. \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court may only \nconsider evidentiary materials that are referenced in, or attached to, the \ncomplaint. Wilson v. Price, 624 F.3d 389, 392 n.1 (7th Cir. 2010); McCready \nv.  eBay,  Inc.,  453  F.3d  882,  891-92  (7th  Cir.  2006).  Dart’s  self-serving \ndenials of liability may, of course, be considered on a motion for summary \njudgment (after Dart has submitted to a deposition), but have no place in a \nRule 12(b)(6) motion. \n  \n-8- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 9 of 24 PageID #:981\nIV.  Conclusion \nThe  Court  should  therefore  deny  defendant  Dart’s  motion  to \ndismiss.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/   Kenneth N. Flaxman \n  Kenneth N.

ST. EVE, District Judge: \nPlaintiff Susan Nicol (\"Nicol\") filed a four-count second amended complaint against \nDefendants John Lavin (\"Lavin\") in his official capacity as Director of the Department of \nCommerce & Community Affairs (\"DCCA\"), Pam McDonough (\"McDonough\") in her \nindividual and official capacities as the former Director of the DCCA, Robert Hearn (\"Hearn\") \nin his individual and official capacities as Supervisor in the Grant Monitoring Section of the \nDCCA, and the Tllinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity (\"DCEO\") fonnerly \nknown as the DCCA.  Specifically, Plaintiff alleged race discrimination creating a hostile work \nenvironment and retaliation in violation or 42 U.S.C. § 1981 against Lavin, McDonough, Hearn, \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 12 of 24 PageID #:984\nand the DCEO (Count I); creation of a hostile work environment and retaliation in violation of \nTitle VII ofthe 1964 Civil Rights Act against the DCEO (Count II); race, national origin, and \nskin color discrimination creating a hostile work envirorunent in violation of42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nagainst Lavin, McDonough, and Hearn (Count III); and race, national origin, and skin color \ndiscrimination in violation of the Illinois Civil Rights Act of2003 against the DCEO (Count IV). \nPlaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment, damages, and injunctive relief.  Defendants have moved \nto dismiss all four counts pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  For the reasons stated herein, Defendants' motion is granted \nin part and denied in part. \nBACKGROUND' \nPlaintifTNicol is of Korean national origin, and was a b'nlnt monitor with the DCCA \nwhen the alleged discrimination occurred.  (R. 20-1, Second Am. Compl. at 2, ~ 2.)  Defendant \nHearn, an African-American, is a Supervisor with the DCCA and supervised Nicol.  (Jd. ,1,1 6-8.) \nIn July 2001, Nicol returned from maternity leave and over the course of several months Hearn \nmade inappropriate oral remarks and physical gestures toward her, and exhibited a demeaning \nattitude toward her work performance because of her race, national origin, and skin color.  (ld. \n~~ 12-14.)  Hearn's conduct adversely impacted Nicol's work envirorunent.  (fd. ,1,112, 20.) \nAfter Nicol complained about Hearn's conduct, Hearn used his supervisory role to take reprisal \nactions against her.  (Jd. ,1,112-13.)  Despite Nicol's informal written complaint and EEOC \ncharges, the DCCA- under McDonough's direction-never completed an internal investigation \n1  The Court assumes that the allegations in Plaintiffs complaint are true for purposes of \nthis Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Stachon v.  United Consumers Club, Inc., 229 F.3d 673, 675 (7'h Cir. \n2000). \n2 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 13 of 24 PageID #:985\nor resolved the complaints.  (!d.~~ 5, 15, 17-19.)  Further, during the alleged discrimination and \nretaliation, the DCCA had a custom and practice oC failing to adequately investigate and provide \nrelief!o employees' complaints.  (ld. ~ 24.)  Moreover, McDonough knew about Hearn's \ndiscriminatory conduct, deliberately failed to investigate or remedy the situation, and ratiHed \nHearn's actions.  (/d.~ 22.)  Consequently, Nicol resigned her position with the DCCA on May \n22, 2002.  (!d. ,121.) \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nA Rule 12(b)(l) motion is a defense asserting a federal court's lack of subject matter \njurisdiction over a lawsuit.  See Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(b)(l).  The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion is to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint, not the merits of the case.  Triad Assocs., \nInc.  v. Chicago Hous. Auth ., 892 F.2d 583, 586 (7'\" Cir. 1989).  The Court must view the \nallegations in the complaint \"in the light most favorable to the plaintiff: taking as true all well-\npleaded factual allegations and making all possible inferences from those allegations in his or \nher favor.\"  Lee v.  City ofC  hicago, 330 F.3d 456,459 (7'11 Cir. 2003).  A complaint is not \nrequired to allege all, or any, of the J\"acts entailed by the claim; the plaintiff can plead \nconclusions.  Shah v. Inter-Continental Hotel Chicago Operating Corp., 314 F.3d 278, 282 (7'11 \nCir. 2003).  Consequently, the Court may grant the motion to dismiss \"only if it appears beyond \ndoubt that the plaintiff could prove no set of facts entitling him to relief.\"  Triad Assocs., Inc., \n892 F.2d at 586. \nANALYSIS \nCount I: § 1981 Claim \nI, \n42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides, in part: \nAJl persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every \n3 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 3\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 14 of 24 PageID #:986\nState and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and \nto the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and \nproperty as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, \npenalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.  42 U.S.C. § \n1981(a) (2004). \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, that Plaintiff has \nfailed to state a claim under§ 1981, and that Plaintiff's § 1981 claim is barred by the statute of \nlimitations.  The Court will address the arguments in turn. \nA.  Eleventh Amendment'  Immunity \nUnder the Eleventh Amendment, a state and its agencies arc immune from private suits \nseeking damages or injunctive relief in l'ederal court unless by express and unequivocal language \nthe state or Congress waives the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Kroll v. Bd. of \nTrustees, 934 F.2d 904, 907 (7'h Cir. 1991 ).  Eleventh Amendment immunity shields state \nagencies from federal damages liability for§ 1981 claims.  Rur.:ker v.  Higher Educ. Aids Bd., 669 \nF.2d 1179, 1184 (7'h Cir. 1982).  In addition, a lawsuit against ''a state official in his or her \nofticial capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the oflicial's office\" \nand \"is no dill'ercnt from a suit against the Slate itself.\"  Will v.  Michigan Dep't o[Stak Police, \n491 lJ.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal citations omitted).' \nThe State of lllinois has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity for§ 1981 \n2 \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in \nlaw or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another \nState, or by Citi;r,ens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"  U.S. Const. amend. XI. \n3  Notably, the Seventh Circuit in dicta cited Will to state that a district court correctly \nconcluded that a former Illinois govemor lacks § 1981 damages liability in his oflicial capacity \npursuant to the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity.  See Hearne v.  Bd. of Edu<:. of City of \nChicago, 185 F.3d 770, 776 (7'h Cir. 1999) (citing Will and stating that the proposition was \"so \nwell established that it needs no further discussion\"). \n4 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 15 of 24 PageID #:987\nclaims.  &e 745 ILL. CoMP. STAT. 5/1,5/1.5 (2004).  Also, Congress \"has not expressed in \nunequivocal language intent to alter immunity\" in§ 1981 claims.  Perkins v. Bd. of Trustees \nUniv. of Illinois, No. 95 C 4320, 1996 WL 308292, at* I (N.D.lll. June 4, 1996).  A state \nofficial, however, may be sued in his or her official capacity when injunctive relief is sought \nbecause \"oflicial-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the \nState.\"  Kentuckyv. Graham,473 U.S.l59, l67,n.l4(1985);Exparte Young,209U.S. 123, \n159-60 ( 1908).  See also Edelman v. Jordan, 4 I 5 U.S. 651, 668-69 (1974) (stating that enjoining \nstate officials' for past legal duty breach where its \"practical effect\" is indistinguishable from a \nretroactive damages award is barred by the Eleventh Amendment) (followed by Brazdo v. \nIllinois Dep 't ofP  rof'I  Regulation, No. 94 C 134, 95 C 2066, 1995 WL 733445, at *4 (N.D. Ill. \nDec. 8, 1995)).  A plaintiff must show a \"real or immediate threat of future harm\" to have \nstanding to seek prospective equitable relief.  Sierakowski v.  Ryan, 223 F.3d 440, 443 (7'h Cir. \n2000) (citing City ofL  os Angeles v.  Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983)). \nPlainliffNicol alleges a§ 1981 claim against the DCEO, Lavin, McDonough, and Hearn \nin their official capacities.  The DCEO is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Because \nPlain!i IT seeks prospective relief in her complaint, including reinstatement, her claim against \nLavin and Hearn in their official capacities survives as to those only.  Finally, McDonough as \nformer Director of the DCCA is incapable of providing prospective relief, thus the claim against \nher in her official capacity is dismissed. \nB.  Failure to State a Claim Under § 1981 \nDefendants argue that tl1e complaint fails to state a claim under§ 1981 because it \ninsufficiently alleges race discrimination and personal involvement.  To state a claim under§ \n5 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 5\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 16 of 24 PageID #:988\n,< \n1981  Plaintiff must allege that (I) she is a member of a racial minority; (2) Defendants \nintended to discriminate on the basis of race; and (3) the discrimination concerned the making \nand enforcing of a contract.  See Morris v.  Oj]ice Max. Inc., 89 F.3d 411,413 (7'h Cir. 1996). \nThus, per Morri.1·, personal involvement is not an clement of a§ 1981 claim.' \nPlaintiffs complaint contains sufficient allegations of the first and third elements of her§ \n1981 claim.  As to Hearn, Plainti!Tsufficiently alleges the second element ofhcr § 1981 claim in \nalleging that Ileam engaged in the alleged conduct \"because of [her] race.\"  As to McDonough, \nPlaintill' sufficiently alleges the second clement of her § 1981 claim in alleging that McDonough, \nas the Director of the DCCA during the alleged race discrimination, \"knew\" about Heam's \nalleged race discrimination, deliberately failed to fully respond to Plaintiff's internal complaint \nand complete an internal investigation thereof; and ratified Hearn's alleged race discrimination. \nAccordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss is denied as to Plaintiffs§ 1981 cbim against \nMcDonough and Hearn. \nC.  Statute of Limitations \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs § 1981 claim is barred by a two-year statute of \nlimitations.  Congress enacted a four-year statute of] imitations for federal statutory claims \nenacted after December 1, 1990.  Jones v.  R.R. Donne/ley & Sons Co., 124 S.Ct 1836, !839 \n(2004); 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a) (2002).  The statute provides \"a genera\\4-year limitations period for \nany federal statute subsequently enacted without one of its own.\" Jones, 124 S.Ct at 1845, n. 14 \n4  In light of Section I.A. of this Opinion and Order, only Plaintiffs§ 1981 claim against \nMcDonough and Hearn in their individual capacities is at issue. \n5  The Court notes that Rascon v. Ilardiman, 803 F.2d 269 (7'h Cir. 1986), was improperly \ncited in its March 10, 2004 Minute Order § 1981 discussion. \n6 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 17 of 24 PageID #:989\n(quoting North Star Steel Co.  v.  Thomas, 515 U.S. 29, 34 (1995)) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 amended § 1981 such that !he statute prohibited race \ndiscrimination in the employment context.  Jones, 124 S.C! at 1846.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (b) \n(2004).  Therefore, the Supreme Court in Jones held that the four-year statute of limitations \napplied because the plaintiff's hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and failure-to-\ntransfer claims were brought pursuant to § 1981 as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. \nJones, 124 S.Cl at 1846. \nHere, Plaintiff alleges race discrimination in the employment context pursuant to § 1981 \nas an1ended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and therefore !he four-year statute of limitations \ncontained in 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a) applies.  Plaintiff alleges such race discrimination by \nMcDonough and Hearn until at least April 2002 and October 2001, respectively.  Plaintiff filed \nher original complaint on September 22, 2003, within the applicable four-year statute of \nlimitations.  Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs§ 1981 claim pursuant to the \nstatute oflimitations is denied. \nIT.  Count II: Title VII Claim \nDefendants argue that the Court should dismiss the race and national origin \ndiscrimination allegations in Count II because those allegations exceed the scope of her EEOC \ncharge.  Plaintiff fails to directly respond to this argument. \nGenerally, \"a Title Vll plaintiff cannot bring claims in a lawsuit that were not included\" \nin an EEOC charge.  Cheek v_  Western & Southern Life Ins. Co., 31  F.3d 497, 500 (7!1' Cir. \n1994).  The EEOC charge is a \"condition precedent with which Title VII plaintiffs must comply\" \n- that promotes dispute settlement and provides notice- and is \"not jurisdictional.\" /d. (citing \nZip~s v_  Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 392 (1982) and Babrocky v. Jewel Food Co., \n7 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 7\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 18 of 24 PageID #:990\n773 F.2d 857. 864 (7'h Cir. 1985)).  See also Gibson v.  West, 201 FJd 990, 994 (7'\" Cir. 2000). \nA Title VII plaintiff is not required to allege in an EEOC charge \"each and every fact that \ncombines to form the basis of each claim\" in the complaint, a standard entailing \"significant \nleeway.\"  Cheek, 31 F.3d at 500 (internal quotations omitted). \nAn EEOC charge encompasses the claims in a complaint when (I) there is a \"reasonable \nrelationship\" between the EEOC charge's allegations and the claims stated in the complaint; and \n(2) the claims slated in the complaint can \"reasonably be expected to grow out of an EEOC \ninvestigation\" of the charge's allegations.  !d.  As to the first inquiry, the Seventh Circuit in \nCheeks stated that an EEOC charge and a complaint's claims are not \"reasonably related unless \nthere is a factual relationship between them\" that at minimum describes the \"same conduct\" and \nimplicates the \"same individuals.\"  !d. at 501 (internal quotations omitted).  See Jayne v. ABF \nFri!ight System, Inc., No. 98 C 2680, 1999 WL 92920, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 16, 1999) \n(concluding that plaintiff did not satisfy the Cheek test where the EEOC charge and complaint \nfailed to describe the same people and failed to mention any individual by name).  Additionally, \ncourts may look beyond the EEOC charge document when undertaking the first inquiry.  See \nRush v.  McDonald's Corp., 966 F.2d 1104, 1110 (7'h Cir. 1992) (considering plaintifl's artldavit \nthat was attached to and filed with the EEOC charge).  As to the second inquiry, the Seventh \nCircuit has noted that this requires \"speculation as to what the EEOC might or might not \ndiscover\" during an investigation.  Cheek, 31 F.3d at 501. \nPlaintiff Nicol checked boxes on three EEOC charges indicating race, color, national \norigin, sex, and age discrimination, and retaliation.  (R. 24-2, Defs.' Mem, Supp. Mot. Dismiss, \nEx. D.)  With all three EEOC charges, Plaintiff attached and referred to a statement, and two \nEEOC charges had attached and referred to correspondence.  (/d.)  Each of these statements \n8 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 8\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 19 of 24 PageID #:991\nrelates to allegations of discrimination and derogatory comments regarding Plaintitr s sex or age, \nand retaliation.  None of the factual statements discuss or relate to her race or national origin. \nThe Seventh Circuit has noted that \"simple technicalities such as '[w]hat boxes, for \ninstance, are checked on the EEOC form do not necessarily control the scope of a subsequent \ncomplaint.\"'  Noreuil v. Peabody CoCII Co., 96 F.3d 254,259 (7'h Cir. 1996) (quoting Kristujek v. \nHussmann Foodservice Co., Toastmaster Div., 985 F.2d 364, 368 (7'1> Cir. 1993)).  The Court \nfinds that Plaintifrs claims of race and national origin discrimination are not rea~onably related \nto her sex discrimination and retaliation claims and cannot \"reasonably be expected to grow out \nof an EEOC investigation\" of such claims.  Accordingly, those claims are dismissed From Count \nII.  See Mohan v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 1999 WL 495113, at •10 (N.D. Ill. Jun. 30, 1999) \n('This Court finds that merely checking a box--without more--docs not fulfill the administrative \npurposes that a charge with the EEOC is designed to serve, and docs not provide a basis for a \nlater federal court discrimination complaint\"). \nIll,  Count IJI: § 1983 Claim \nPlaintiff premises Count III on§ 1983, which protects citizens' constitutional rights, \nprivileges, and immunities from being infringed by state actors.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2004). \nDefendants argue four grounds for dismissing Count IlL  First, Defendants argue that Lavin, \nMcDonough, and Hearn in their official capacities, arc entitled to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity.  Second, Defendants argue that Lavin, McDonough, and Hearn in their official \ncapacities, are not \"persons\" under § 1983.  Third, Defendants argue that the complaint fails to \nstate a claim under § 1983 because it insuft1eiently alleges a constitutional violation aml pcrsonul \ninvoivement.  Fourth, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs § I 983 claim is barred by the statute of \nlimitations.  The Court will address the arguments in turn. \n9 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 9\n\n• \nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 20 of 24 PageID #:992\nA.  Eleventh Amendment Immunity \nDefendants argue that Lavin, McDonough, and Hearn in their oflicial capacities, are \nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  As stated above, the Eleventh Amendment provides \na state and its agencies immunity from private federal suits unless by express and unequivocal \nlanguage the state or Congress waives the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Kroll, 934 \nF.2d at 907.  The State of Illinois has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity for§ 1983 \nclaims.  See 745 ILL. CoMP. STAT. 5/1,5/1.5 (2004).  Further, Congress has not abrogated the \nstates' Eleventh Amendment immunity from § 1983 claims.  See Quem v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, \n341 (1979) (followed by Horton v. Marovich, 925 F.Supp. 540,545 (N.D. Ill. 1996)). \nFor the same reasons discussed above regarding Plaintitl' s § 1981 claim, Plaintiff's § \n1983 claim survives as to prospective relief only.  13ecause McDonough as the l(mner Director \nol'the DCCA is incapable of providing prospective relief, Plaintiffs§ 1983 claim against \nMcDonough in her official capacity fails. \nB.  Pcrsoos Under § 1983 \nDefendants argue that Lavin, McDonough, and Hearn in their official capacities, are not \n\"persons\" under § 1983.  In Will v. Michigan Department ofS tate Police, the Supreme Court \nheld that \"neither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are 'persons' under§ \n1983.\"  Will, 491 U.S. at 71.  However, state officials arc persons under§ 1983 when sued lor \ninjunctive relief in their official capacities.  /d. at 71, n. 10 (citing Kentucky, 473 U.S. at 167, n. \n14; Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159-60).  Thus, Plaintiffs claim against Lavin and Hearn in \ntheir official capacities survives regarding injunctive relief. \nC.  :Failure to State a Claim Under§ 1983 \nDefendants argue that the complaint fail~ to state a claim under § 1983 because it \n10 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 10\n\n• \nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 21 of 24 PageID #:993\ninsufficiently alleges a constitutional violation and personal involvement.  In order to state a § \n1983 claim, Plaintiff must allege that (I) Defendants violated Plaintiff's constitutional rights; \nand (2) they acted under color of state law.  Pickrel v. City ofSpringfield, 45 F.3d 1115, 1118 \n(7'h Cir. 1995); Reichenberger v. Pritchard, 660 F .2d 280, 284 (7'h Cir. 1981 ).  As to \nMcDonough, a supervisory oflicial, Plaintiff must allege that McDonough was directly \nresponsible for the constitutional violation and by her acts or omissions \"knowingly, willfully, or \nat least recklessly caused\" the violation of Plaintiffs constitutional rights.  See McPhaul v. Bd. \no[Comm 'rs ofMadison County, 226 F.3d 558, 566 (7'h Cir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted). \nRefining the inquiry as to a supervisory official, Plaintiff need not allege \"direct participation\" \nbut merely acts or omissions at McDonough's \"direction,\" with McDonough's \"knowledge and \nconsent,\" or exhibiting McDonough's \"deliberate or reckless disregard\" lor Plaintiffs \nconstitutional rights.  See Rascon v.  Hardiman, 803 F.2d 269, 274 (7'h Cir. 1986).  Moreover, to \nslate her § 1983 claim against both Hearn and McDonough pursuant to the Equal Protection \nClause, Plaintiff must allege that a state actor purposefully discriminated against her because or \nher identi lica!ion with a particular group.  See Sherwin Manor Nursing Center. Inc. v.  McAuliffe, \n37 F.3d 1216, 1220 (7111 Cir. 1994).  PlaintiiT has sufficiently alleged each of the elements of a § \n1983 claim in her Second Amended Complaint. \nD.  Statute of Limitations \nDefendants next argue that Plainli Cfs § 1983 claim is barred by the statute of limitations. \nFederal courts must adopt the forum state's statute oflimitations for personal injury claims as \nthe proper statute of limitations for§ 1983 claims.  Wilson v.  Garcia, 471 U.S. 261,276 (1985). \nThe appropriate statute oflimitations for§ 1983 claims filed in the State of Illinois is two years \nas set forth in 735 ILCS § 5/13-202.  Mitchell v.  Donchin, 286 F.3d 447, 450, n. I (7'h Cir. 2002); \n11 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 11\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 22 of 24 PageID #:994\nAshaja v.  City ofC  hicago, 146 F.3d 459, 461  (7'\" Cir. 1998). \nPlaintiff alleges race, national origin, and skin color discrimination creating a hostile \nwork environment pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and therefore the two-year statute of limitations \napplies.  PlaintitTalleges such discrimination regarding McDonough and Hearn until at least \nApril2002 and October 2001, respectively.  Because Plaintiffs § 1983 claim arises out or the \nsame conduct alleged in her original complaint, it relates back to the date of the original pleading \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2).  See Johnson v. Artim Transp. System, Inc., 826 \nF.2d 538, 547 n. 9 (7'\" Cir. 1987).  Plaintiffs original complaint was filed on September 22, \n2003, within the applicable two-year statute oflimitations.  Accordingly, Defendants' motion to \ndismiss Plaintiffs § 1983 claim pursuant to the statute oflimitations is denied. \nIV.  Count IV: Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003 Claim \nThe Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003 (\"Illinois Civil Rights Act\") prohibits the state from \nengaging in race, color, or national origin discrimination.  See 740 ILL. COMP. STAT. 23/5(a)( I) \n(2004 ).  Defendants argue that Count IV should be dismissed because the conduct on which \nCount IV is based took place before the erfective date of the Illinois Civil Rights Act.  The Court \nagrees. \nThe Illinois Civil Rights Act states that its \"(e  )ffective\" date is January I, 2004.  See \n2003 Ill. Legis. Serv. 93-425 (West).  Where the legislature has clearly indicated a statute's \ntemporal reach, the Court must adhere to it absent constitutional violation.  Commonwealth \nEdison Co.  v.  Will County Collector, 749 N.E.2d 964, 971 (lll. 2001).  In addition, the legislature \nhas set forth the temporal reach or every statute lacking its own limitations period in 5 ILCS § \n70/4, the \"Statute on Statutes\" forbidding retroactive application of substantive statutes.  See \nCaveney v.  Bower, 797 N.E.2d 596, 603-4 (Til. 2003) (following People v.  Glisson, 782 N.E.2d \n12 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 12\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 23 of 24 PageID #:995\n25 I (II1. 2002)); 5 ILL. COMP. STAT. 70/4 (1874).  q  Bottoms v. Illinois Dep 't of Human \nServices, No. 03 C 1881,2004 WL 1403811, at *3 (N.D.lll. June 22, 2004) (following Caveney \nand concluding that 745 !LCS § S/1.5, whose effective date was January 1, 2004, could not be \napplied retroactively in light of the statute's express temporal reach and the \"default provisions \nof the Statute on Statutes\"). \nHere, Plaintiffs claims pertain to conduct and events that occurred in 200 I and 2002. \n(SeeR. 20-1, Second Am. Compl. at 9, ~~ 2-22.)  Indeed, when the Illinois Civil Rights Act \nbecame effective on January I, 2004, Plaintiff's c<tSe was already pending in this Court.  (SeeR. \n1-1, Campi. at 9.)  Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Illinois Civil Rights \nAct claim is granted. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motion to dismiss. \nDated: August 12,2004  ENTERED \n13 \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 13\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 147 Filed: 12/07/10 Page 24 of 24 PageID #:996\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI hereby certify that  on the 7th day of December, 2010, I electronically\nﬁled the foregoing with the Clerk of the  Court using the CM/ECF system which\nwill send notiﬁcation of such ﬁling to the following:  Michael Gallagher, ASA,\n500 Daley Center, Chicago, IL 60602, and I hereby certify  that I have mailed by\nUnited  States Postal Service the document   to the following non CM/ECF\nparticipants:  none.\n/s/ Kenneth N.

See 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class\nCertification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.

(R. 13-1, Amend. Compl. ¶ 4.)  At the time\nthey entered the Cook County Jail, both Zaborowski and Jackson were pregnant.  (Id. ¶ 5.)

Immediately before\ngiving birth, the attending physician requested that the deputy sheriff unshackle Zaborowski’s foot.  (Id. ¶ 10.) \nThe deputy sheriff complied with the doctor’s request and Zaborowski was shackled to the bed by one arm when\nshe delivered her child on August 30, 2008.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs further allege that in accordance with the Sheriff’s\npolicy, the deputy sheriff then re-shackled Zaborowski’s foot about an hour after she gave birth.  (Id. ¶ 11.) \nZaborowski remained at Stroger Hospital until the evening of the next day, September 1, 2008.  (Id. ¶ 12.) \nDuring this time period, Zaborowski was shackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was not permitted to use\nthe toilet or to get up from the bed to walk.  (Id.)\nAfter Jackson went into labor on May 3, 2008, her counselor from the Haymarket Center took her to\nStroger Hospital.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance with the Sheriff’s\npolicies, deputy sheriffs shackled Jackson’s hand and foot to the hospital bed.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Jackson remained\nshackled hand and foot while she was in labor and during birth.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  An armed deputy sheriff remained in\nthe hospital room while she was in labor and delivered her child.  (Id.)  Jackson remained at Stroger Hospital for\napproximately four days during which Jackson was shackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was not\npermitted to use the toilet or to get up from the bed to walk per the Sheriff’s policies.  (Id. ¶ 16.)\nIn their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs seek to certify the following class:  “All women in the\ncustody of defendant Sheriff on and after December 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled during labor,\ndelivery, or recovery following delivery.”  Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4), Plaintiffs request that this case be\nmaintained as a class action solely to adjudicate the legality of the Sheriff’s shackling policy and that all\nquestions of damages for the unnamed class members be reserved for separate, subsequent damages actions.  (R.\n26-1, Mot. Class Cert., at 1.)1\nLEGAL STANDARD\n“[T]he primary purposes of the class-action mechanism” are “judicial economy and efficiency.”  Andrews\nv. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570, 577 (7th Cir. 2008).  To that end, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nstates that “[o]ne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses\nof the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); see also Harper v. Sheriff of Cook County, 581 F.3d 511, 513 (7th Cir. 2009).  Failure to meet\nany of these Rule 23(a) requirements precludes class certification.  See id.; Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 797\n(7th Cir. 2008).\nIn addition to satisfying the requirements under Rule 23(a), a party seeking class certification must also\nestablish that the proposed class satisfies one of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(b).  See Amchem Prods.,\nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997); Arreola, 546 F.3d at 794.  Here,\nPlaintiffs request certification of the proposed class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), which applies when “the questions\n1  After the parties briefed Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, the Court requested\nsupplemental briefing regarding Plaintiffs’ request to maintain the class action solely to\nadjudicate the legality of the Sheriff’s policy and reserving questions of damages for the\nunnamed class members to subsequent actions.  \n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 2 of  6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 58 Filed: 12/09/09 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:551\nof law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\nthe controversy.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); see also Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 615-16.  Under Rule 23(b)(3), if\n“a few class members’ injuries prove to be substantial, they may opt out and litigate independently.”  Murray v.\nGMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948, 953 (7th Cir. 2006).\nThe party seeking class certification has the burden of establishing that certification is proper.  See\nOshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 513 (7th Cir. 2006).  In determining whether a party has carried that\nburden, a court need not accept all of the complaint’s allegations as true.  See Szabo v. Bridgeport Mach., Inc.,\n249 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 2001).  Instead, in deciding whether to certify a class, the Court “should make\nwhatever factual and legal inquiries [that] are necessary under Rule 23.”  Id. at 676; see also General Tel. Co. of\nSw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982) (courts may “probe behind the\npleadings before coming to rest on the certification question”).  Meanwhile, courts will not address the merits of a\nclass action claim unless it affects the class certification.  See Szabo, 249 F. 3d at 677. District courts have broad\ndiscretion in determining motions for class certification.  See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 345, 99\nS.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979); Payton v. County of Carroll, 473 F.3d 845, 847 (7th Cir. 2007).  \nANALYSIS\nI. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nA. Numerosity\nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement under Rule 23(a)(1), Plaintiffs must show that the number of\nmembers in the proposed class is so large that joinder would be impracticable.  See Pruitt v. City of Chicago, Ill.,\n472 F.3d 925, 926 (7th Cir. 2006).  Although there is no bright-line rule for numerosity, a class of at least forty\nmembers is sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement.  See id.; Harris v. Best Buy Co., Inc., 254 F.R.D. 82,\n85 (N.D. Ill. 2008).  \nPlaintiffs maintain that they have identified at least 49 women who gave birth while in the Sheriff’s\ncustody during the class period despite Defendants’ failure to produce all of the documents Plaintiffs have\nrequested.  Plaintiffs have provided a list of these 49 women.  Because Plaintiffs have already identified 49\nputative class members and maintain that they may be able to identify more once Defendants produce more\nrelevant documents, Plaintiffs have met the numerosity requirement under Rule 23(a)(1).  See Streeter v. Sheriff\nof Cook County, 256 F.R.D. 609, 612 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (“The Court may rely on common sense assumptions or\nreasonable inferences when ascertaining the size of the class.”); see also Arreola, 546 F.3d at 798.\nB. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that Plaintiffs prove the existence of questions of fact or law common to the\nproposed class.  See Culver v. City of Milwaukee, 277 F.3d 908, 910 (7th Cir. 2002) (class must be reasonably\nhomogeneous).  “A common nucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement\nof Rule 23(a)(2).”  Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998).  A common nucleus of fact exists when a\ndefendant has “engaged in standardized conduct towards members of the proposed class.”  Id.  Because Plaintiffs’\nclass action relies on the Sheriff’s standardized conduct pursuant the shackling policy, Plaintiffs have met their\nburden in establishing the commonality requirement under Rule 23(a)(2).  See Streeter, 256 F.R.D. at 612.  In\naddition, the class members are governed by the same legal rules as to the Sheriff’s liability.  See In re\nBridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 288 F.3d 1012, 1015 (7th Cir. 2002) (“No class action is proper unless all litigants\nare governed by the same legal rules.”).\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 3 of  6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 58 Filed: 12/09/09 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:552\nC. Typicality\nNext, Plaintiffs must establish that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the\nclaims or defenses of the class.”  Rahman v. Chertoff, 530 F.3d 622, 627 (7th Cir. 2008); Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explains:\nA claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the\nclaims of other class members and her claims are based on the same legal theory.  Even though some\nfactual variations may not defeat typicality, the requirement is meant to ensure that the named\nrepresentative’s claims have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.\nArreola, 546 F.3d at 798 (quoting Oshana, 472 F.3d at 514) (quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nPlaintiffs satisfy the typicality requirement because their claim and the putative class members’ claims are\nbased on the same legal theory and arise from the same practice or course of conduct, namely, the Sheriff’s\nshackling policy.  See Arreola, 546 F.3d at 798.  As such, Defendants’ strained distinction that some of the\nputative class members came directly from the Cook County Jail instead of the Haymarket Center has no bearing\non the Court’s typicality analysis.  See id. (“some factual variations may not defeat typicality”).\nD. Adequacy Requirement – Rule 23(a)(4)\n“The adequacy inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties\nand the class they seek to represent.”  Amchem Prods, 521 U.S. at 625; see also Asher v. Baxter Int’l Inc., 505\nF.3d 736, 737 (7th Cir. 2007) (“Minimum standards of adequacy are the domain of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4), which\npermits a class action only if ‘the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass.’”).  When determining the adequacy requirement, courts look to whether:  (1) the named plaintiffs have\nconflicting or antagonistic claims with members of the putative class; and (2) counsel is qualified, competent, and\nexperienced.  See Kohen v. Pacific Inv. Mgmt. Co., LLC, 571 F.3d 672, 679 (7th Cir. 2009); Rosario v. Livaditis,\n963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992).\nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs’ counsel is qualified, and thus the Court turns to whether Plaintiffs have\nconflicting or antagonistic claims to members of the proposed class.  As discussed above, Plaintiffs request that\nthis case be maintained as a class action solely to adjudicate the legality of the Sheriff’s shackling policy and that\nall questions of damages for the unnamed class members be reserved to individual damages actions.  Under the\ncircumstances, Plaintiffs are reserving the issue of damages to fulfill the commonality requirement due to the\nindividualized nature of the proposed class members’ damages.  By doing so, the named Plaintiffs are\njeopardizing the unnamed class members’ ability to bring damages claims in subsequent lawsuits based on res\njudicata, also known as claim preclusion.  See Feinstein v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 535 F.Supp. 595, 606\n(S.D.N.Y. 1982) (tailoring “class claims in an effort to improve the possibility of demonstrating commonality”\nwas “purchased at the price of presenting putative class members with significant risks of being told later that\nthey had impermissibly split a single cause of action.”).\nTo clarify, the “doctrine of res judicata bars a person from splitting his claim between two suits.”  Allan\nBlock Corp. v. County Materials Corp., 512 F.3d 912, 915 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Restatement (Second) of\nJudgments §§ 24, 25 and comment b (1982)); see also Rivet v. Regions Bank of La., 522 U.S. 470, 476, 118 S.Ct.\n921, 139 L.Ed.2d 912 (1998) (“Under the doctrine of claim preclusion, ‘[a] final judgment on the merits of an\naction precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that\naction.’”) (citation omitted).  Thus, under the circumstances, if the Court allowed Plaintiffs’ class action to go\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 4 of  6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 58 Filed: 12/09/09 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:553\nforward on the issue of liability only – leaving the issue of damages until future, individualized damages\nproceedings – the unnamed class members may be barred from seeking any damages.  More specifically, because\nsubsequent courts will determine the preclusive effect of this Court’s judgment in the present matter, the Court\ncannot ensure that granting class certification solely on the policy question as the named Plaintiffs’ request would\npreserve the class members’ rights to bring future damages claims.  See In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether\n(“MTBE”) Prods. Liab. Litig., 209 F.R.D. 323, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2002); Thompson v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,\n189 F.R.D. 544, 550 (D. Minn. 1999) (“even if the Court permits the reservation of issues in this case, whether a\nsubsequent court would honor such a reservation is, at best, undeterminable at this time.”); see also Phillips\nPetroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 805, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985) (“court adjudicating a dispute\nmay not be able to predetermine the res judicata effect of its own judgment”).  Therefore, even though courts\nhave recognized an exception to splitting separate substantive claims in the context of class certifications, see\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs, Inc., 256 F.R.D. 586, 597-98 (N.D. Ill. 2009), under the present\ncircumstances, Plaintiffs are attempting to impermissibly split a single cause of action by separating the liability\ndetermination from the class members’ individual damages claims to the potential detriment of the unnamed class\nmembers.  See Feinstein, 535 F.Supp. at 606.\nAccordingly, the named Plaintiffs do not adequately protect the interests of the putative class members\ndue to their request to reserve individual damages claims for subsequent lawsuits.  See Thompson, 189 F.R.D. at\n550-51; Feinstein, 535 F.Supp. at 606-07; see also MTBE Prods. Liab., 209 F.R.D. at 340-41 (named plaintiffs\nwho waive potential claims of absentee plaintiffs are inadequate class representatives).  Meanwhile, Plaintiffs fail\nto explain how the putative class members could “opt out” pursuant to Section 23(b)(3) under these\ncircumstances, especially in light of the fact that every single class member would have to opt out in order for the\nCourt to ensure that the proposed class members’ rights to bring future damages claims are adequately preserved. \nSee MTBE Prods. Liab., 209 F.R.D. at 340.  As such, requiring the unnamed plaintiffs to opt out in order to\npreserve their damages claims defeats the purpose of class treatment in the first instance.  See Thorogood v.\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 547 F.3d 742, 744 (7th Cir. 2008) (“The class action is an ingenious device for\neconomizing on the expense of litigation and enabling small claims to be litigated.”).  Indeed, Plaintiffs fail to\nexplain how the unnamed plaintiffs could opt out and preserve their damages claims.  Therefore, the named\nPlaintiffs have failed in their burden of establishing the adequacy requirement under Rule 23(a)(4).  See Oshana,\n472 F.3d at 513.\nII. Superiority and Predominance Requirements– Rule 23(b)(3)\nUnder Rule 23(b)(3), the Court must determine whether (1) the questions of fact or law common to the\nclass members predominate over questions affecting only the individual class members, and (2) a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods of adjudicating plaintiffs’ claims.  See Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 615;\nAndrews, 545 F.3d at 577.  Rule 23(b)(3) includes a list of factors for courts to consider regarding the\npredominance and superiority criteria:\n(A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of\nseparate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already\ncommenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of\nconcentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be\nencountered in the management of a class action.\nAmchem Prods, Inc., 521 U.S. at 615-16; see also Szabo, 249 F.3d at 676. \n            Here, the class action – as proposed – does not fulfill the superiority requirement under Rule 23(b)(3)\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 5 of  6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 58 Filed: 12/09/09 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:554\nbecause judicial economy is not served by the Court determining the Sheriff Office’s liability after which at least\n49 subsequent damages lawsuits could follow.  See Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577 (“primary purposes of the class-\naction mechanism [are] judicial economy and efficiency”).  Put differently, any efficiencies gained from\nconsolidating the question of the Sheriff’s liability do not outweigh the fact that 49 separate plaintiffs may file\nsubsequent damages lawsuits based on the same common facts.  See id.; see also Hyderi v. Washington Mut.\nBank, FA, 235 F.R.D. 390, 406 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (efficiency gains from consolidation did not outweigh follow-up\nprocedures).  \nIn addition, Plaintiffs’ argument that this is not a “nominal damages” case works against the superiority\nrequirement.  See Jackson v. National Action Fin. Servs., Inc., 227 F.R.D. 284, 290 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (“A class\naction is superior where potential damages may be too insignificant to provide class members with incentive to\npursue a claim individually.”).  In fact, there are three other pending lawsuits in the Northern District of Illinois\nthat challenge the Sheriff’s shackling policy for pregnant women in custody in which the plaintiffs seek similar\ncompensatory damages.  See Danielle Bryant v. Sheriff of Cook County & County of Cook, No. 09 C 1546;\nKatina Embrey v. Sheriff of Cook County & County of Cook, No. 09 C 3470; and Marilu Morales v. Sheriff of\nCook County & County of Cook, No. 09 C 3546.  \nFinally, in their supplemental briefs, Plaintiffs maintain that “Rule 23 allows district courts to devise\nimaginative solutions to problems created by the presence in a class action litigation of individual damages\nissues.”  Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004).  From the arguments made in their\nsupplemental briefing, it appears that Plaintiffs are suggesting that the Court could hold separate trials as to the 49\nor more class members’ damages even though the individual plaintiffs’ claims for damages would not be before\nthe Court.  As is the case here, a “putative class representative cannot satisfy the predominance requirement by\ndefining the common issue narrowly and leaving all of the individual issues for follow-on proceedings.” Harper,\n581 F.3d at 515 (quoting Hyderi, 235 F.R.D. at 406).\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al.

Facts \nEach year, more than 30 women give birth while in the custody of \nthe Sheriff of Cook County.1  \nIn 1998, the Sheriff adopted a policy mandating that all pregnant \nwomen in his custody be shackled during labor and during recovery \nfollowing labor.2 The Sheriff’s shackling policy requires a Deputy She-\nriff to bind one leg and one arm of the pregnant detainee to her hospital \nbed. (Exhibit 2 at 56:4-6.) The policy also requires an armed Deputy \nSheriff to remain with the pregnant detainee during labor and delivery. \n(Exhibit 2 at 56:14-17.) \nIn May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876 (7th Cir. 2000), the Seventh \nCircuit held that the Sheriff’s policy requiring that all hospital detai-\nnees be shackled to their beds was “plainly excessive” as applied to an \nAIDS patient. Id. at 884. The Court reaffirmed this settled law in Hart \nv. Sheahan, 396 F.3d 887 (7th Cir. 2005), when it quoted from May that \n“the use of bodily restraints constitutes punishment in the constitu-\n                                         \n1 This is an estimate based on discovery in this case. Defendants have not as \nyet fully responded to discovery seeking information about the precise num-\nber of births. \n2 The Sheriff’s spokesperson is quoted in AP news reports that “[t]he measure \nwas enacted after a woman in 1998 jumped out of the hospital window, rip-\nping her stitches, and bleeding to death.” (Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1.) Plaintiffs do \nnot believe that this sad event involved childbirth. \n-2- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 3 of 163 PageID #:54\ntional sense if their use is not rationally related to a legitimate non-\npunitive government purpose or they appear excessive in relation to the \npurpose they allegedly serve.” Id. at 892. The question presented in this \ncase is whether the use of bodily restraints on a pregnant woman dur-\ning labor, delivery, or recovery following delivery is “rationally related \nto a legitimate non-punitive government purpose.” Id. \nPlaintiffs Catherine Zaborowski and Simone Jackson were preg-\nnant when processed into the jail. (Amended Complaint, ¶5.) Jackson \nwent into labor on May 3, 2008 and was taken to Stroger Hospital to \ndeliver her child. (Amended Complaint, ¶13.) At the hospital, deputy \nsheriffs shackled Jackson hand and foot to a hospital bed. (Amended \nComplaint, ¶14.) Jackson remained shackled while she was in labor \n(Amended Complaint, ¶15) and was unshackled for ten minutes during \ndelivery. (Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 5.) \nJackson remained at the hospital for four days following delivery; \nthroughout this recovery period, she continued to be shackled hand and \nfoot to the hospital bed and was not allowed to use the toilet or to get \nup from the bed to walk. (Amended Complaint, ¶16.) The experiences of \nplaintiff Zaborowski were similar. \nZaborowski went into labor on August 29, 2008 and was taken to \nStroger Hospital to deliver her child. (Amended Complaint, ¶7.) There, \n-3- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 4 of 163 PageID #:55\ndeputy sheriffs shackled Zaborowski hand and foot to a hospital bed. \n(Amended  Complaint,  ¶8.)  Zaborowski  remained  shackled  for  about \neleven hours while she was in labor. (Amended Complaint, ¶9.) Imme-\ndiately before actual delivery of the child, the attending physician re-\nquested the deputy sheriff to unshackle Zaborowski’s foot. (Amended \nComplaint, ¶10.) The deputy complied with this request and Zaborows-\nki was shackled to the bed by one arm when she delivered her child. Id.  \nZaborowski remained at the hospital until the evening of the day \nafter delivery. (Amended Complaint, ¶12.) During this period, she was \nshackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and not permitted to use the \ntoilet or to get up from the bed to walk. Id. \n Plaintiffs were shackled because of defendant Dart’s official poli-\ncy,  as  admitted  at  a  Rule  30(b)(6)  deposition  by  Superintendent \nHolmes. (Exhibit 2.)  \nHolmes stated that the policy allows for the removal of shackles \nduring actual delivery of the child. (Exhibit 2 at 118:7-24.) Holmes may \nbe misinformed about the actual policy: the experience of plaintiff Za-\nborowski suggests that the policy is to retain the shackle on one arm \nduring delivery. (Amended Complaint, ¶12.) \nA Rule 23(b)(3) class action is the appropriate vehicle to adjudi-\ncate the legality of the shackling policy. Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d \n-4- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 5 of 163 PageID #:56\n788, 798 (7th Cir. 2008). Plaintiffs show below that the proposed class \nsatisfies each of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and that certification is \nappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3). \nII.  The Proposed Class Satisfied Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) \nThis Court recently analyzed the standards of Rule 23 in Makor \nIssues & Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs, Inc. 256 F.R.D. 586 (N.D.Ill. 2009) and \nHarris v. Best Buy Co., Inc., 254 F.R.D. 82 (N.D.Ill. 2008): The propo-\nnent of class certification must show that the proposed class satisfies \neach of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and that the proposed class sa-\ntisfies one of the subsections of Rule 23(b). This case satisfies each of \nthese requirements. \nA. Numerosity \n Plaintiff asks the Court to allow this case to proceed for: \nAll women in the custody of defendant Sheriff on and after \nDecember 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled \nduring labor, delivery, or recovery following delivery. \nPlaintiffs  have  requested  defendants  to  produce  information \nabout the precise number of childbirths on and after December 4, 2006; \nwhile  defendants  have  not  as  yet  fully  complied  with  this  request, \nplaintiffs’ counsel estimate from the information available that each \nyear, more than 30 women give birth while in the custody of the Sheriff \n-5- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 6 of 163 PageID #:57\nof Cook County. Thus, counsel estimate that there are at least 75 wom-\nen in the proposed class. \nIn Cotton v. Asset Acceptance, LLC, No. 07-C-5005 (N.D.Ill. June \n26, 2008, Exhibit 3), this Court endorsed the rule of thumb that “a class \nof  at  least  forty  members  is  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  numerosity  re-\nquirement.” (Exhibit 3 at 4.) Plaintiffs expect defendants to agree that \nthe  proposed  class  meets  this  benchmark;  plaintiffs  anticipate  that \ndefendants will not dispute numerosity. \nB. Commonality \nThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied when a \ndefendant has “engaged in standardized conduct towards members of \nthe proposed class.” Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir.1998); \nHarris v. Best Buy Co., Inc., 254 F.R.D. 82, 87 (N.D.Ill. 2008). This re-\nquirement is satisfied in this case, where the class claim arises from \ndefendants’ shackling policy. \nThe common question in this case is whether the use of bodily re-\nstraints on a pregnant woman during labor, delivery, or recovery fol-\nlowing  delivery  is  “rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  non-punitive \ngovernment purpose,” as required by May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, \n884 (7th Cir. 2000). This  question is  “common to  all potential class \n-6- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 7 of 163 PageID #:58\nmembers,” Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 798 (7th Cir. 2008), and \nsatisfies the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a). \nC. Typicality \n“A plaintiff’s claim is typical if it arises from the same event or \npractice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class \nmembers and his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.’” \nKeele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 595 (1998); De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van \nCamp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir.1983). \nIn this case, the class claim arises from the shackling policy that \ndefendants applied to the named plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ claim thus satis-\nfies the typicality requirement of Rule 23. Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d \n788, 798 (7th Cir. 2008). \nD. Adequacy of Representation \nDefendants cannot  dispute  that competent attorneys  represent \nthe proposed class.3 Nor can defendants argue that either of the named \nplaintiffs has any interest at odds with that of the proposed class. De-\nfendants may argue, however, that the named plaintiffs cannot ade-\n                                         \n3 Plaintiff’s attorneys are class counsel in several cases challenging various \npractices at the jail, including Jackson v. Sheriff, 06 CV 493 (challenge to \nSTD testing); Phipps v. Sheriff, No. 07  CV 3998 (challenge to ADA com-\npliance at jail for wheelchair bound detainees); Parish v. Sheriff, 07 CV 4369 \n(challenge to administration of prescription medication at jail); Streeter v. \nSheriff, No. 08 CV 732 (challenge to return from court strip search policy).  \n-7- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 8 of 163 PageID #:59\nquately represent the class because of their criminal history. This ar-\ngument is wholly without merit: “Several courts have certified or have \napproved the certification of classes of prisoner and detainee plaintiffs. \n[citations omitted] If defendants were correct, there would be no such \nthing as a class action in the prison or jail context. In any event, defen-\ndants have failed to provide any basis to believe that the named plain-\ntiffs’ criminal histories differentiate them from other class members or \nmake their interests different from those of the class as a whole.” Pa-\nrish v. Sheriff, supra, Exhibit 10 at 9. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(3): Predominance and Superiority \n Rule 23(b)(3) requires the Court to find “that questions of law or \nfact common to the members of the class predominate over any ques-\ntions affecting only individual members, and that the class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudica-\ntion of the controversy.”  \nThe “predominant question” in this case is whether the use of bo-\ndily restraints on a pregnant woman during labor, delivery, or recovery \nfollowing  delivery  is  “rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  non-punitive \ngovernment purpose,” as required by May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, \n884 (7th Cir. 2000). This claim does not turn on individual issues. See, \ne.g., Parish v. Sheriff, Exhibit 4 at 9.  \n-8- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 9 of 163 PageID #:60\nIn Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Systems Corp., 319 F.3d 910 (7th Cir. \n2003), the Seventh Circuit endorsed Rule 23(b)(3) class actions when, \nas in this case, “there are genuinely common issues, issues identical \nacross all the claimants, issues moreover the accuracy of the resolution \nof which is unlikely to be enhanced by repeated proceedings.” Id. at \n911. As in Mejdrech, “it makes good sense, especially when the class is \nlarge, to resolve those issues in one fell swoop while leaving the re-\nmaining, claimant-specific issues to individual follow-on proceedings.” \nId. \nThe Seventh Circuit recently reaffirmed this view in Arreola v. \nGodinez, 546 F.3d 788, 798 (7th Cir. 2008). Arreola teaches that in eva-\nluating requests for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), the district \ncourt must consider the provision of Rule 23(c)(1)(B) authorizing the \nclass treatment of “claims” as well as “issues.” Id. at 800. Thus, the \npossibility that the amount of damages might vary among individual \nclass members is not a basis for refusing to allow a case to proceed as a \nclass action. \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that each class member should receive a \nseparate  determination  of  damages.  Accordingly,  plaintiffs  request, \npursuant to Rule 23(c)(4), that the case be maintained as a class action \nsolely to adjudicate the legality of the Sheriff’s shackling policy, leaving \n-9- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 10 of 163 PageID #:61\nall questions of damages for unnamed members to be resolved in indi-\nvidual actions. \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons above stated, plaintiffs request that the Court \norder that this case be maintained as a class action for: \nAll women in the custody of defendant Sheriff on and after \nDecember 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled \nduring labor, delivery, or recovery following delivery. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n /s/ Kenneth N.

From the time you were the external  \n \n        3   director in March of 2006 until the time you left,  \n \n        4   was it the policy and practice of the Cook County  \n \n        5   Sheriff to have a guard assigned to each  \n \n        6   hospitalized detainee? \n \n        7       A.

Yes, sir. \n \n        9       Q.  What was the change in policy? \n \n       10       A.  The change in policy that was made was that  \n \n       11   inmates assigned to hospitals were either roomed  \n \n       12   together, housed alone -- if this is the same -- or  \n \n       13   placed in a single room. \n \n       14       Q.

It was my recollection, to protecting the  \n \n        9   citizens, staff of Cook County, and the employees  \n \n       10   at Cook County Hospital to be more safeguarded by  \n \n       11   placing the inmates in a more isolated, secured  \n \n       12   area. \n \n       13       Q.

Again, my belief, removing any inmate from  \n \n       17   the confines of the CCDOC is a more heightened risk  \n \n       18   of possible unusual occurrence with the general  \n \n       19   public. \n \n       20       Q.

SMITH:  Until August of '08. \n \n        2           THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir. \n \n        3   BY MR. MORRISSEY:  \n \n        4       Q.  What was the manner in which they were  \n \n        5   shackled during that period of time? \n \n        6       A.  The restraints protocol was a leg shackle  \n \n        7   on one leg and the other end of the shackle secured  \n \n        8   to a secure portion of the bed, and the use of a  \n \n        9   handcuff with a -- it's referred to as a \"blue box\"  \n \n       10   over it with a belly chain, and that is attached to  \n \n       11   the opposite end of the inmate's arm and to the  \n \n       12   secure part of the bed frame. \n \n       13       Q.  Now, can you describe what a belly chain  \n \n       14   is? \n \n       15       A.  A belly chain is a waist chain that the  \n \n       16   handcuffs and blue box attach to the waist of a  \n \n       17   detainee. \n \n       18       Q.  What is a blue box? \n \n       19       A.  A blue box is a device that protects the  \n \n       20   locking mechanism of the handcuffs that cannot be  \n \n       21   reached to alter the locking mechanism. \n \n       22       Q.  Does that have a way of electronically  \n \n       23   monitoring a detainee, the blue box? \n \n       24       A.  No, sir. \n \n \n \n \n                     TOOMEY REPORTING   (312) 853-0648 \n   \n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2 Page 52\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 66 of 163 PageID #:117\n \n                                                                 53 \n \n \n        1       Q.  The waist chain, or belly chain, does that  \n \n        2   surround the person's waist? \n \n        3       A.  Yes, sir. \n \n        4       Q.  What is the purpose for the waist chain? \n \n        5       A.  Again, in transporting an inmate from the  \n \n        6   CCDOC complex, it is again a restraint safeguarding  \n \n        7   the staff and the general public from an unusual  \n \n        8   occurrence that would be caused by the inmate. \n \n        9       Q.  Does that waist chain remain on the  \n \n       10   hospitalized detainees when they're in their beds? \n \n       11       A.  Not on the inmate, but it's from the  \n \n       12   handcuffs to the bed frame. \n \n       13       Q.  How is this policy and practice of shackling  \n \n       14   hospitalized detainees conveyed to the guards that  \n \n       15   are assigned to hospitals? \n \n       16       A.  Through the Standard Operating Procedure and  \n \n       17   at roll calls. \n \n       18       Q.  Is this a difference in the External  \n \n       19   Operations between the classification of \"active  \n \n       20   labor\" and \"labor\"? \n \n       21       A.  I don't recall. \n \n       22       Q.  Have you ever heard the term \"active labor\"? \n \n       23       A.  Yes, sir. \n \n       24       Q.  And what do you understand active labor to  \n \n \n \n \n                     TOOMEY REPORTING   (312) 853-0648 \n   \n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2 Page 53\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 67 of 163 PageID #:118\n \n                                                                 54 \n \n \n        1   mean? \n \n        2       A.  An individual is in the process of delivering  \n \n        3   a baby. \n \n        4       Q.  What do you mean by \"the process of  \n \n        5   delivering a baby\"? \n \n        6       A.  The beginning of the, repeating again, the  \n \n        7   person beginning to -- the baby from leaving the  \n \n        8   womb to entering the world. \n \n        9       Q.  So that would be right before the delivery  \n \n       10   of the baby, you would consider active labor? \n \n       11       A.  I don't know. \n \n       12       Q.  Well, you just described the period when  \n \n       13   the baby is leaving the womb and entering the world  \n \n       14   as active labor; is that correct? \n \n       15       A.  Yes, sir. \n \n       16       Q.  How do you describe \"labor\"? \n \n       17       A.  To my knowledge, labor would also be the  \n \n       18   same. \n \n       19       Q.  During the period between -- what is the  \n \n       20   penological reason for classifying all detainees  \n \n       21   as high-risk inmates? \n \n       22       A.  Inmates from outside the CCDOC complex?  \n \n       23       Q.  Right.  \n \n       24       A.  Again, it would be the lesser security of  \n \n \n \n \n                     TOOMEY REPORTING   (312) 853-0648 \n   \n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2 Page 54\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 68 of 163 PageID #:119\n \n                                                                 55 \n \n \n        1   the confines of the CCDOC moving an inmate into the  \n \n        2   area reached by the general public or staff members,  \n \n        3   wherever that inmate is. \n \n        4       Q.

Again, it would be for an inmate leaving the  \n \n       14   secure confines of the CCDOC entering an area of the  \n \n       15   general public, uhm, being in the custody of the  \n \n       16   Sheriff, the officer is taking all precautions to  \n \n       17   protect, again, the staff, general public, and the  \n \n       18   officer's safety themselves. \n \n       19       Q.

I believe  \n \n        3   we're probably missing the document from August 29th.   \n \n        4   There probably was an additional document from  \n \n        5   August 29th that we don't have with us. \n \n        6           MR.

Did you agree in August of 2008 that it  \n \n        8   would be all right not to have an armed guard  \n \n        9   present for a women who is assigned to the MOM's  \n \n       10   program and who is hospitalized in labor? \n \n       11       A.  Yes. \n \n       12       Q.  Why did you come to that conclusion? \n \n       13       A.  Due to the detainee being housed from not  \n \n       14   within the confines of the CCDOC, she became -- she  \n \n       15   was less of a risk to all. \n \n       16       Q.

Now, in August of 2008 a decision  \n \n        4   was made by you and Superintendent Hickerson that in  \n \n        5   the future not only would women who are in the MOM's  \n \n        6   program not have a guard present with them once they  \n \n        7   were hospitalized, correct, but also those women  \n \n        8   would not be restrained with shackles once they  \n \n        9   arrived at the hospital; correct?  \n \n       10                 Do you understand the question? \n \n       11       A.

ST. EVE, District Court Judge: \nPlaintiffs Cleve Cotton, III and Darryl T. Scott bring the present one-count First\nAmended Complaint against Defendant Asset Acceptance, LLC (“Asset Acceptance”), alleging\nviolations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1601, et seq. \nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23.  For the following reasons, the Court, in its discretion, grants Plaintiffs’ Rule 23\nmotion.\nBACKGROUND\nIn their First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Asset Acceptance is engaged in\nthe business of purchasing charged-off consumer debts, including telecommunications debts, and\nenforcing the debts against consumers.  (R. 8-1, First Am. Compl. ¶ 9.)  On February 26, 2007,\nAsset Acceptance filed a lawsuit against Cotton in the Circuit Court of Cook County to collect a\ndebt for personal telecommunications services.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  The state court entered a default\njudgment of $2,373.00 against Cotton in June 2007.  (Id.)  On or about June 18, 2007, Asset\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 139 of 163 PageID #:190\nAcceptance filed a lawsuit against Scott in the Circuit Court of Cook County to collect a debt for\npersonal telecommunications services.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  Asset Acceptance filed these state court\nlawsuits as an assignee of AT&T, a telecommunications company regulated by the Federal\nCommunications Commission.  (Id. ¶ 16.)  \nPlaintiffs further allege that the charges for which recovery was sought in their state court\nlawsuits were more than two years old and that the applicable statute of limitations to an action\nfor the recovery of charges by a telecommunications carrier regulated by the Federal\nCommunications Commission is two years pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 415.  (Id. ¶¶ 17, 18.) \nPlaintiffs also allege that Asset Acceptance regularly files and threatens to file lawsuits on\nfederally-regulated telecommunications debts that are more than two years old at the time of the\nfiling.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that Asset Acceptance engages in a pattern\nand practice of filing lawsuits on time-barred debts of modest amounts knowing that the persons\nsued could not retain counsel to defend such suits except by paying an amount comparable to\nthat sought in the lawsuits.  (Id. ¶ 26.)  Plaintiffs thus maintain that Asset Acceptance’s conduct\nconstitutes both a deceptive and unfair collection practice in violation of the FDCPA.  (Id. ¶ 28.)\nLEGAL STANDARD\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) states that “[o]ne or more members of a class may\nsue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses\nof the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of\nthe class.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 513 (7th Cir. 2006).\n2\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 140 of 163 PageID #:191\nFailure to meet any of these Rule 23(a) requirements precludes class certification.  Harriston v.\nChicago Tribune Co., 992 F.2d 697, 703 (7th Cir. 1993).\nIn addition to satisfying the requirements under Rule 23(a), a party seeking class\ncertification must also establish that the proposed class satisfies one of the requirements set forth\nin Rule 23(b).  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d\n689 (1997); Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.  Here, Plaintiffs request certification of the proposed class\npursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), which applies when “the questions of law or fact common to the\nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and\nthat a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\nthe controversy.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); see also Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 615.  Under Rule\n23(b)(3), members of a certified class may opt out and pursue their claims individually.  See In\nre Allstate Ins. Co., 400 F.3d 505, 508 (7th Cir. 2005).\nThe party seeking class certification has the burden of establishing that certification is\nproper.  See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513; Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d\n584, 596 (7th Cir. 1993).  In determining whether a party has carried that burden, a court need\nnot accept all of the complaint’s allegations as true.  See Szabo v. Bridgeport Mach., Inc., 249\nF.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 2001).  Rather, in deciding whether to certify a class, the court “should\nmake whatever factual and legal inquiries [that] are necessary under Rule 23.”  Id. at 676. \nFinally, district courts have broad discretion in determining motions for class certification.  See\nReiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 345, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2334, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979);\nPayton v. County of Carroll, 473 F.3d 845, 847 (7th Cir. 2007).\nANALYSIS\nPlaintiffs define the class they seek to certify as follows:\n3\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 3\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 141 of 163 PageID #:192\nThe class consists of (a) all individuals (b) against whom defendant Asset\nAcceptance, LLC filed a lawsuit in Illinois, Wisconsin or Indiana (c) to collect a\ndebt for cellular or other federally regulated telecommunications services (d)\nwhere any of the telecommunications charges antedated the filing of the lawsuit\nby two years, (e) which lawsuit was pending at any time during a period\nbeginning one year prior to the filing of this action and ending 20 days after the\nfiling of this action.\n(Id. ¶ 32.)\nI. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\nA. Numerosity\nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement under Rule 23(a)(1), Plaintiffs must show that the\nnumber of members in the proposed class is so large that joinder would be impracticable.  See\nPruitt v. City of Chicago, Ill., 472 F.3d 925, 926 (7th Cir. 2006).  Although there is no bright-line\nrule for numerosity, a class of at least forty members is sufficient to satisfy the numerosity\nrequirement.  See id.; Hinman v. M &M Rental Ctr., Inc., 545 F.Supp.2d 802, 805 (N.D. Ill.\n2008).  Because Plaintiffs point to evidence that there are approximately 7,900 individuals who\nmay fit the class definition, Plaintiffs have met the numerosity requirement under Rule 23(a)(1).\nB. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires that Plaintiffs prove the existence of questions of fact or law\ncommon to the proposed class.  See Culver v. City of Milwaukee, 277 F.3d 908, 910 (7th Cir.\n2002) (class must be reasonably homogeneous); Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir.\n1998).  “A common nucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality\nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(2).”  Keele, 149 F.3d at 594.  A common nucleus of fact exists when a\ndefendant has “engaged in standardized conduct towards members of the proposed class.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs contend that the common nucleus of operative fact is that Asset Acceptance\nbrings or threatens to bring lawsuits to collect federally regulated telecommunications debts that\n4\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 142 of 163 PageID #:193\nare over two years old, and thus are time-barred under the Federal Communications Act\n(“FCA”).  See 47 U.S.C. § 415.  Plaintiffs also maintain that Asset Acceptance’s conduct gives\nrise to two legal questions:  (1) whether the FCA statute of limitations applies; and (2) whether\nfiling or threatening to file time-barred lawsuits violates the FDCPA. \nAsset Acceptance, on the other hand, argues that because many of the proposed class\nmembers’ telephone bills contain both state-regulated and federally-regulated services, their\nclaims are not subject to common facts.  It is well-established, however, that “[t]he fact that there\nis some factual variation among the class grievances will not defeat a class action.”  See Rosario\nv. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992); see also Keele, 149 F.3d at 594 (“factual\nvariations among class members’ grievances do not defeat class action.”).1  Indeed, because\nAsset Acceptance’s alleged conduct was standardized as to the putative class members and the \nclass members share factual and legal questions, Plaintiffs have met their burden in establishing\nthe commonality requirement under Rule 23(a)(2).  See Keele, 149 F.3d at 594; see, e.g.,\nCicilline v. Jewel Food Stores, Inc., 542 F.Supp.2d 831, 836 (N.D. Ill. 2008).\nC. Typicality\nThe typicality and commonality requirements are usually interrelated.  See Rosario, 963\nF.3d at 1018.   Under Rule 23(a)(3), “the typicality requirement primarily directs the district\ncourt to focus on whether the named representatives’ claims have the same essential\ncharacteristics as the claims of the class at large.”  Retired Chicago Police, 7 F.3d at 596-97; see\n1  Asset Acceptance also argues that Plaintiffs’ claims cannot be adjudicated on a class-\nwide basis because each putative class member’s claims hinges on individualized evidence.  The\nCourt will discuss Asset Acceptance’s class-wide proof argument under the predominance\nrequirement pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).\n5\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 5\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 143 of 163 PageID #:194\nalso De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983) (“plaintiff’s\nclaim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to\nthe claims of other class members and his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.”).  \nHere, the issues are plain enough from the pleadings to determine that the named\nPlaintiffs’ interests encompass the putative class members’ interests based on Plaintiffs’\nallegations that Asset Acceptance brings collection actions on telecommunications debts after\nthe federal statute of limitations has run.  See General Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147,\n160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982); see also Stokely-Van Camp, 713 F.2d at 232\n(plaintiff’s claim typical if it arises from same practice or course of conduct giving rise to other\nclass members’ claims).  Nevertheless, Asset Acceptance asks the Court to “probe behind the\npleadings” in an attempt to show that Plaintiffs’ claims have factual differences and that\nPlaintiffs’ claims lack merit.  See Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160.  At this stage of the proceedings,\nhowever, the Court will not “delve into the merits of the ultimate issues in the case.”  See\nCicilline, 542 F.Supp.2d at 835.  Moreover, class members’ claims need not be factually\nidentical to satisfy the typicality requirement.  See Brieger v. Tellabs, Inc., 245 F.R.D. 345, 350\n(N.D. Ill. 2007); Flanagan v. Allstate Ins. Co., 242 F.R.D. 421, 428 (N.D. Ill. 2007).\n  In short, in pursuing their own claims, Plaintiffs will advance the interests of the\nproposed class.  See Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156; Keeler, 149 F.3d at 595.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have\nmet their burden in establishing the typicality requirement under Rule 23(a)(3).  \nD. Adequacy\n“The adequacy inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest\nbetween named parties and the class they seek to represent.”  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 625; see also\nAsher v. Baxter Int’l Inc., 505 F.3d 736, 737 (7th Cir. 2007) (“Minimum standards of adequacy\n6\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 144 of 163 PageID #:195\nare the domain of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4), which permits a class action only if ‘the representative\nparties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.’”).  To establish the adequacy\nrequirement, class representatives must show that (1) their claims are not antagonistic or in\nconflict with those of the proposed class, (2) they have sufficient interest in the outcome of the\ncase, and (3) experienced, competent counsel represents them.  See Rosario, 963 F.2d at 1018;\nsee also Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156.  \nAsset Acceptance does not challenge the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Instead, Asset\nAcceptance argues that because Scott believes that he does not owe a debt on his\ntelecommunication charges, his claim is antagonistic to the other putative class members’\nclaims.  Whether Scott believes he owes the disputed debt does not change the legal theory on\nwhich he bases his claim, namely, that Asset Acceptance filed a time-barred claim against him in\nstate court in violation of the FDCPA.  Asset Acceptance also argues that Cotton is an\ninadequate class representative because he wants to remove the state court judgment from his\ncredit record and does not understand the class claims.  Not only does Asset Acceptance’s\nargument misstate Cotton’s deposition testimony, but Cotton’s alleged misunderstanding of his\nclaim does not defeat class certification.  See Murray v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., 232\nF.R.D. 295, 300 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (“It is well established that a named plaintiff’s lack of\nknowledge and understanding of the case is insufficient to deny class certification, unless his\nignorance unduly impacts his ability to vigorously prosecute the action.”) (internal citation\nomitted).  Asset Acceptance gives no other relevant reason for denying class certification based\non the adequacy requirement.  Because there are no inconsistencies between Plaintiffs’ claims\nand the class members’ claims, Plaintiffs have established the adequacy requirement under Rule\n23(a)(4).  See Uhl v. Thoroughbred Tech. & Telecomm., Inc., 309 F.3d 978, 985 (7th Cir. 2002).\n7\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 7\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 145 of 163 PageID #:196\nII. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3)\nUnder Rule 23(b)(3), the Court must determine whether (1) the questions of fact or law\ncommon to the class members predominate over questions affecting only the individual class\nmembers, and (2) a class action is superior to other available methods of adjudicating plaintiffs’\nclaims.  See Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 615; In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 288 F.3d 1012,\n1019 (7th Cir. 2002).  The Court first turns to the predominance requirement.\nA. Predominance\n“The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently\ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 623.  In other\nwords, under Rule 23(b)(3), “each member must share common questions of law or fact with the\nrest of the class, therefore making class-wide adjudication of the common questions efficient\ncompared to repetitive individual litigation of the same questions.”  Lemon v. International\nUnion of Operating Eng’g, Local No. 139, AFL-CIO, 216 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir. 2000).  The\nexistence of factual or legal differences within a class does not foreclose a plaintiff from\nestablishing predominance.  See Patterson v. General Motors Corp., 631 F.2d 476, 481 (7th Cir.\n1980); see also Radamanovich v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 216 F.R.D. 424, 435 (N.D. Ill.\n2003) (“Although the common issues must predominate the case, it is not necessary that the\nplaintiff show them to be exclusive.”).  \nWhen determining if a plaintiff has met the predominance requirement, district courts\nmay look beyond the pleadings and determine whether the parties’ claims are subject to proof by\ncommon evidence.  See Radamanovich, 216 F.R.D. at 43; see also Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161.\n(courts may “probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question”).  If\nthe liability issues are not subject to class-wide proof – but instead require individualized\n8\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 8\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 146 of 163 PageID #:197\ndeterminations – the class’ common issues do not predominate.  See Radamanovich, 216 F.R.D.\nat 435-36; see also Hyderi v. Washington Mut. Bank, FA 235 F.R.D. 390, 398 (N.D. Ill. 2006)\n(“predominance is concerned with whether the putative named plaintiffs can, through their\nindividualized cases, offer proof on a class-wide basis”) (citing Hewitt v. Joyce Beverages of\nWis., Inc., 721 F.2d 625, 628-29 (7th Cir. 1983)). \nKey to Plaintiffs’ class definition is the requirement that Asset Acceptance filed a lawsuit\nagainst each putative class member “to collect a debt for cellular or other federally regulated\ntelecommunications services.”  Based on the class definition, Asset Acceptance argues that\nPlaintiffs’ proposed class depends on factual determinations that will be different for each class\nmember.  Specifically, Asset Acceptance maintains that the potential class members will have\ntelephone bills that contain both federally-regulated interstate charges in which the federal two-\nyear statute of limitations may apply, see 47 U.S.C. § 415, and state-regulated intrastate charges\nin which the state statutes of limitations may apply.  See 735 ILCS 5/13-206 (ten-year limitations\nperiod for breach of contract claims in Illinois); Wis. Stat. § 893.43 (six-year limitations period\nfor breach of contract claims in Wisconsin); Ind. Code §§ 34-11-2-9, 344-11-2-11 (depending on\nthe nature of the contract, ten or six-year limitations period for breach of contract claims in\nIndiana).  As such, Asset Acceptance argues that the each of the putative class member’s claims\nand defenses hinges on individualized evidence. \nIn support of its argument, Asset Acceptance provides the Court with a sampling of 400\nfiles of individuals who potentially meet Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition.  (See R. 64-1, Ex.\nA, M. Beach Decl., Ex. 1, Sampling.)  Michael Beach, Asset Acceptance’s Assistant Vice\nPresident of Legal, explained in his declaration that as part of the discovery in this matter, Asset\nAcceptance agreed to produce a 5% sampling of the accounts of approximately 7,908 individuals\n9\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 9\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 147 of 163 PageID #:198\nwho potentially fall within the putative class defined in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint. \n(Id., M. Beach Decl. ¶ 7.)  The sampling reveals that of the 400 accounts compiled,\napproximately 235 include charges for land line services, approximately 52 accounts include\ncharges for cellular services, and that 113 accounts include charges for both land line and\ncellular services.  Accordingly, Asset Acceptance argues that the Court will be required to\nconduct an individual inquiry into each of the debtor’s bills to determine which debts were time-\nbarred when Asset Acceptance filed the state court lawsuits.\nA review of these documents, however, reveals that identifying members of the proposed\nclass is not as difficult as Asset Acceptance suggests.  Instead, the process of identifying class\nmembership and proof of class members’ FDCPA claims are ministerial in nature because the\ninformation can be easily extracted from the class members’ phone bills.  Compare Lau v. Arrow\nFin, Servs., LLC, 245 F.R.D. 620 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (inquiring into each class member’s records to\ndetermine class membership does not preclude class certification) with Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d\n655, 669 (7th Cir. 1981) (membership in class depended on individual’s state of mind); Fletcher\nv. ZLB Behring LLC, 245 F.R.D. 328, 332 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (proof of fraud allegations were\nplaintiff-specific).  Under the present circumstances, whether an individual fits the definition of\nthe proposed class, as well as the evidence supporting their FDCPA claims, can be determined\non an objective, class-wide basis, and thus Asset Acceptance’s argument that liability questions\nare not subject to class-wide proof fails.  \nB. Superiority\nFinally, the Court must determine whether a class action is superior to other methods for\nthe adjudication of the proposed class’ claims.  See Szabo, 249 F.3d at 676.  A class does not\nsatisfy the superiority requirement if its claims are not governed by the same legal rules.  See In\n10\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 10\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 148 of 163 PageID #:199\nre Bridgstone/Firestone, 288 F.3d at 1015.  Here, the proposed class’ claims concern the same\nalleged violations of the FDCPA, namely, whether Asset Acceptance’s conduct constitutes an\nunfair or deceptive collection practice.  See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e, 1692f.  In addition, the Seventh\nCircuit teaches that class treatment for actions involving thousands of consumer class members\nwith the same claim are superior to individual actions:\nRule 23(b)(3) was designed for situations such as this, in which the potential\nrecovery is too slight to support individual suits, but injury is substantial in the\naggregate.  Reliance on federal law avoids the complications that can plague\nmulti-state classes under state law, and society may gain from the deterrent effect\nof financial awards.  \nMurray v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948, 953 (7th Cir. 2006) (internal citations\nomitted); see also Cicilline, 542 F.Supp.2d at 838 (“Class certification is usually considered a\nsuperior method of adjudicating claims involving standardized conduct.”).  The Court’s\nconclusion that a class action is superior to individual lawsuits under the circumstances is also\nsupported by “the policy at the very core of the class action mechanism[,]” which “is to\novercome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to\nbring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.”  Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp., 109 F.3d 338,\n344 (7th Cir. 1997).  Plaintiffs have thus established superiority under Rule 23(b)(3).\n11\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3  Page 11\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 149 of 163 PageID #:200\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion For Class Certification pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\nDated:  June 26, 2008\nENTERED\n_____________________________\nAMY J.

KENNELLY,  District Judge:\nMichael Parish and eleven other plaintiffs have sued the Sheriff of Cook County\nand Cook County for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Plaintiffs allege that the\ndefendants maintained a policy or practice of deliberate indifference to their serious\nmedical needs and thus violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights while they were\nconfined at the Cook County Jail (CCJ).  Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class action\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  For the reasons stated below, the\nCourt grants plaintiffs’ motion\nFacts\nThe Court takes the following facts from plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint. \nPlaintiffs allege that the defendants have implemented a policy of denying or delaying\nnecessary prescription medication to detainees at CCJ.  The policy allows medical\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 152 of 163 PageID #:203\ntechnicians to deny various kinds of necessary prescribed medication solely on the basis\nof a “brief and cursory interview,” without inquiring into a detainee’s medical history and\nwithout consulting a physician.  2nd Am. Compl., ¶¶ A.c., B.c.  \nPlaintiffs divide their allegations into two general categories:  psychotropic\nmedication and non-psychotropic medication.  Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the\ndefendants’ policy allows medical technicians to deny prescribed psychotropic\nmedication to detainees after a short interview.  Instead, these detainees are routinely\ngiven anti-depressants, which are less costly than the psychotropic medications. \nSeveral of the plaintiffs reported suffering behavioral problems while on anti-depressants\nthat they had not experienced while taking their prescribed psychotropic medication.\nWith respect to detainees who have been prescribed non-psychotropic\nmedication, plaintiffs allege that medical histories are taken in overcrowded areas with\nlittle privacy.  They also allege that the defendants’ policy allows medical technicians to\ndiscontinue prescribed medications required to prevent serious injury or death.  The\npolicy also prohibits physicians at the jail from prescribing medication for chronic pain. \nFinally, plaintiffs allege that there is no speedy or efficient procedure that allows a\ndetainee to see a physician after a medical technician has denied any form of\nmedication.\nParish alleges that he was transferred to the jail on September 27, 2005 from the\nIllinois Department of Corrections, where he had received psychotropic medication on a\nregular basis.  Although he arrived at the jail with the medication, the medical technician\nconcluded that Parish should no longer receive the psychotropic medication.  Parish\ntried to obtain the medication for nine months.  After an unsuccessful suicide attempt,\n2\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 153 of 163 PageID #:204\nParish was finally prescribed the medication.  Parish was released in 2006 but returned\nto the CCJ in 2007.  Although Parish informed the medical technician of his need for\npsychotropic mediation, the medical technician again denied him the medication.  Parish\ntried repeatedly to see a physician.  Only after another unsuccessful suicide attempt was\nhe finally permitted to see a physician who prescribed psychotropic medication.\nThe remaining plaintiffs all allege that at their intake interviews , they informed\nmedical technicians of their condition and their prescribed medications.  Nevertheless,\nthe medical technicians denied them medications prescribed for conditions including\nmental illness, severe chronic pain, enlarged prostate, heart disease, acid reflux,\ncongestive heart failure, asthma, hepatitis C, and a surgical wound.  As a result, the\nplaintiffs suffered a variety of adverse consequences, including behavioral problems,\nsevere pain, and an infection requiring hospitalization. \nPlaintiffs filed suit in August 2007.  They contend that defendants implemented a\npolicy or practice at the CCJ of denying necessary prescribed medication in a manner\nthat constitutes deliberate indifference to their serious medical needs, in violation of their\nFourteenth Amendment rights.  Plaintiffs have moved the Court to certify, under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), a class of “all persons confined at the Cook County Jail\non and after August 3, 2005 who provided notice that he or she had been taking\nprescription medication for a serious health need and who was not provided with\nappropriate medication within 24 hours thereafter.”\nDiscussion\nThe Court may certify a case as a class action if the party seeking certification\ndemonstrates that it has met all the requirements of Rule 23(a) and one of the\n3\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 3\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 154 of 163 PageID #:205\nrequirements of 23(b).  Under Rule 23(a), the party must prove that the class is so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the proposed class; the class representatives’ claims are typical of the\nclaims of the class; and the representatives will fairly and adequately represent the\ninterests of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4).  In this case, plaintiffs seek\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3).  To succeed, they must show that “questions of law or\nfact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting\nindividual members, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \nPlaintiffs bear “the burden of demonstrating that certification is appropriate.” \nRetired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, 596 (7th Cir. 1993).  The\nCourt need not rely solely on the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint in assessing whether\nto certify a class, but instead “should make whatever factual and legal inquiries are\nrequired under Rule 23.”  Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 675-76 (7th\nCir. 2001). \nA. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be so numerous that joinder of all its members\nis impracticable.  Courts may not rely on conclusory allegations as to the size of a class\nor the impracticability of joinder, Marcial v. Coronet Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 954, 957 (7th Cir.\n1989), and may require that a plaintiff prove class size through affidavits or other\nevidence.  Szabo, 249 F.3d at 676.  The plaintiff need not, however, specify the exact\nnumber of persons in the class.  Marcial, 880 F.2d at 957.\n4\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 155 of 163 PageID #:206\nIn this case, the proposed class consists of detainees who requested but were\ndenied necessary prescribed medications while confined at CCJ on or after August 3,\n2005.  Plaintiffs first based their claim of numerosity on allegations that they had\nuncovered over 300 additional detainees who filed grievances concerning the denial of\nprescription medication.  Defendants pointed out that there was no evidence that the\ngrievances included people who were similarly situated to plaintiffs.  \nThe Court requested that the plaintiffs submit additional evidence of numerosity. \nPlaintiffs submitted over 180 affidavits executed by putative class members, an excerpt\nof a report by the court-appointed monitor in Duran v. Sheahan, Case No. 74 C 2949\n(N.D. Ill.), a 2008 report by the United States Department of Justice on conditions at\nCCJ, and the depositions of three former CCJ employees.  \nDefendants attack the affidavits as “cookie-cutter” documents with only “three or\nfour-line complaints” but make no mention of the other evidence offered.  Def. Supp.\nResp. at 1.  Defendants’ argument is unavailing.  Other courts have accepted similar\naffidavits to support numerosity.  See, e.g., Jackson v. Sheriff of Cook County, No. 06 C\n0493, 2006 WL 3718041, at *3 n. 7 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 14, 2006) (finding that the fact that\nfourteen affidavits submitted in support of class certification contained mostly boilerplate\ntext did not diminish their likely veracity).  The affidavits are statements made under\noath, and defendants have not produced anything suggesting that they are false or\nuntrustworthy.  In addition, the reports by the court-appointed monitor and the\nDepartment of Justice reflect that numerous detainees have complained that they have\nbeen denied prescription medication. The Court finds the affidavits and the other\nevidence plaintiffs have submitted sufficient to establish the requisite numerosity.  \n5\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 5\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 156 of 163 PageID #:207\nB. Commonality\nRule 23(a)(2) requires the existence of questions of law or fact common to the\nclass.  “‘A common nucleus of operative facts is usually enough to satisfy the\ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).’”  Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th\nCir. 1998) (quoting Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992)).  A\ndefendant’s pattern of standardized conduct generally is sufficient to constitute a\ncommon nucleus of operative facts.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs contend that there are common questions of law and fact with respect to\nthe existence and the constitutionality of the policy.  Defendants argue that determining\nwhether the decision to discontinue particular medications amounts to deliberate\nindifference requires an individualized inquiry. \nDefendants’ argument improperly conflates the Rule 23(b)(3) requirement of\npredominance of common issues with the Rule 23(a)(2) requirement of existence of\ncommon issues.  In any event, defendants appear to have misconstrued plaintiffs’\nclaims.  Plaintiffs’ focus, at least for liability purposes, is on the defendants’ alleged\npolicy of allowing unqualified personnel to usurp decisions made by medical doctors and\nother categorical policies, not on the particulars of individualized decisions.  When\n“defendants have engaged in standardized conduct toward members of the proposed\nclass,” the class satisfies Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement.  Keele, 149 F.3d at\n594.\nIn this case, plaintiffs have identified two factual and legal issues common to the\nclass:  whether defendants enforce the alleged policy and whether that policy violates\n6\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 157 of 163 PageID #:208\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  A common legal theory is generally sufficient to support\ncommonality.  Id.  Plaintiffs’ claims clearly share the same legal theory and therefore\nmeet the commonality requirement.  See Arreola v. Godinez, --- F.3d ---, No. 07-1700,\n2008 WL 4553059 (7th Cir. Oct. 14, 2008) (finding that jail detainees’ claims challenging\nthe constitutionality of a medical policy met the commonality requirement); Young v.\nCounty of Cook, No. 06 C 552, 2007 WL 1238920, at *5 (N.D. Ill. April 25, 2007) (finding\ncommonality requirement satisfied when detainee class challenged the constitutionality\nof a blanket strip search policy); Jackson, 2006 WL 3718041, at *4 (finding that plaintiffs’\nchallenge to jail’s standardized STD testing met the commonality requirement even\nthough factual distinctions between class members existed).\nC. Typicality\nThe typicality requirement focuses on “whether the named representatives’ claims\nhave the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.”  De La\nFuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983).  The\nrepresentatives’ claims are “typical if [they] arise[ ] from the same event or practice or\ncourse of conduct that gives rise the claims of the other class members and [their]\nclaims are based on the same legal theory.”  Id.  Factual distinctions between the\nrepresentative parties’ claims and the class members’ claims does not destroy typicality\nso long as the claims share the same legal theory.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs laid out their own factual allegations and later produced 180 affidavits in\nsupport of their claim of typicality.  Again, defendants’ arguments focus on\npredominance rather than typicality.  In essence, they argue that the named plaintiffs’\n7\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 7\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 158 of 163 PageID #:209\nclaims vary as to the type of illness complained of and the type of medication at issue. \nDefendants also contend that medical follow-up differed drastically among the plaintiffs\nand that these differences destroy typicality.\nBetween the complaint and the supplemental affidavits, the plaintiffs have met\ntheir burden with respect to typicality.  Although the affidavits differ with respect to the\nindividual affiants’ particular medical needs and prescriptions, each affiant swore that\nshe notified CCJ personnel of her condition and her prescription, and that she either\nnever received the medication or received it days or weeks later.  These are precisely\nthe underpinnings of the named plaintiffs’ claims.  Because the “representatives’ claims\nhave the same essential characteristics of the class at large,” plaintiffs have satisfied the\ntypicality requirement.  Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 514 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nD. Adequacy\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the “representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  To satisfy this requirement,\nthe interests of the representative parties must coincide with those of the rest of the\nclass, and class counsel must be prepared and able to prosecute the action effectively. \nSee Retired Police Ass’n, 7 F.3d at 598; Levie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 496 F. Supp.\n2d 944, 950 (N.D. Ill. 2007). \nDefendants do not challenge the adequacy of plaintiffs’ counsel, nor do they\ncontend plaintiffs’ interests are at odds with those of other class members.  Instead,\ndefendants focus their objections on the individual plaintiffs’ alleged lack of credibility.  In\n8\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 8\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 159 of 163 PageID #:210\nsupport, defendants list the criminal histories of eight plaintiffs, which include convictions\nfor drug possession, robbery, and theft.  Defendants assert that felons cannot be\nadequate class representatives, but they cite only a Second Circuit decision stating that\ndistrict courts may consider credibility in adequacy of representation determinations. \nSavino v. Computer Credit, Inc., 164 F.3d 81, 87 (2nd Cir. 1998).\nThis argument is lacking in merit.  Several courts have certified or have approved\nthe certification of classes of prisoner and detainee plaintiffs.  Arreola, 2008 WL\n4553059, at *8-*11; Jackson, 2006 WL 3718041, at *5.  If defendants were correct,\nthere would be no such thing as a class action in the prison or jail context.  In any event,\ndefendants have failed to provide any basis to believe that the named plaintiffs’ criminal\nhistories differentiate them from other class members or make their interests different\nfrom those of the class as a whole.\nE. Predominance and superiority\nRule 23(b)(3) requires the Court to find “that questions of law or fact common to\nthe members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that the class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Generally, when a\nclass challenges a uniform policy or practice, the validity of the policy or practice tends to\nbe the predominant issue in the ensuing litigation.  See General Telephone Co. of the\nSouthwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 159 n.15 (1982) (“Significant proof that an employer\noperated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of\nboth applicants and employees.”); Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir.\n9\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 9\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 160 of 163 PageID #:211\n1992) (holding that certification was appropriate when plaintiffs alleged that defendant\nhad “an ongoing scheme to defraud and deceive prospective students”). \nPlaintiffs challenge what they allege are policies and practices applied to the\nentire detainee population.  Defendants contend that a class would be unmanageable\nbecause there are too many individual issues.  Defendants assert that to determine\nliability, the Court will have to examine at least nine specific questions, including the\nrelative urgency of each individual’s need for medication, whether CCJ personnel were\nsubjectively aware of each individual detainee’s serious medical need, and the actual\nharm suffered by each individual.  They maintain that individual determinations are the\nonly way to resolve a deliberate indifference claim.\nAs the Court previously noted, plaintiffs’ claims focus on the policy of allowing\nCCJ personnel lacking medical degrees to in effect overrule decisions made by medical\ndoctors regarding their patients’ medical needs, as well as other allegedly categorically\napplied policies.  Plaintiffs’ primary contention is that the creation and execution of these\npolicy amounts to deliberate indifference.  In this regard, the individual stories of\nparticular detainees may be illustrative, but they are unlikely to be determinative of the\nissue of liability.  The predominant issues in the litigation, at least with regard to liability,\nwill be the existence and constitutionality of the defendants’ alleged policies.  A class\naction is the most efficient device for this kind of case because the legality of the policies\ncan be determined in one proceeding.\nBy contrast, determination of damages for the class members likely will have to\nbe done individually, as the nature and extent of any harm are likely to vary from person\nto person.  Rule 23, however, provides enough flexibility to deal with that while still\n10\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 4 Page 10\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 26 Filed: 06/15/09 Page 161 of 163 PageID #:212\ncertifying a class.  The Court may bifurcate liability and damages trials or appoint a\nmagistrate judge to preside over individual damages proceedings.  Carnegie v.\nHousehold Intern., Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004).  As the Seventh Circuit stated\nearlier this month, “[a]lthough the extent of each class member’s damages might vary,\ndistrict judges can devise solutions to address that problem if there are substantial\ncommon issues that outweigh the single variable of damages amounts.”  Arreola, 2008\nWL 4553059, at *11 (noting that the presence of individual damages issues did not\npreclude certification of a class where the claim alleged deliberate indifference to the\nmedical needs of jail detainees).  This is precisely such a case.  The core issues, which\npredominate over all others, are the common issues the Court has previously identified.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion for class certification\n[docket no. 21].  The Court certifies the following class under Rule 23(b)(3):  all persons\nconfined at the Cook County Jail on and after August 3, 2005 who provided notice that\nhe or she had been taking prescription medication for a serious health need and who\nwas not provided with appropriate medication within 24 hours thereafter.  The case is set\nfor a status hearing on November 13, 2008 at 9:30 a.m.  Counsel are directed to confer\nregarding a proposed form of class notice and to submit a proposal or proposals to the\nCourt by November 10, 2008.\n________________________________\nMATTHEW F.

R. Civ. P. 23. In support, the Defendant states as follows: \nI  INTRODUCTION \n  The motion for class certification should be denied.  Class treatment is inappropriate \nbecause each incident of shackling is an individualized factual event subject to case-by-case \nanalysis to determine if each occurrence was cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth \nAmendment, and/or a violation of Illinois §  730 ILCS 125/17.5 which states:  \n \nNotwithstanding any other statute, directive, or administrative \nregulation, when a pregnant female prisoner is brought to a \nhospital from a county jail for the purpose of delivering her baby, \nno handcuffs, shackles, or restraints of any kind may be used \nduring her transport to a medical facility for the purpose of \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 2 of 14 PageID #:285\ndelivering her baby. Under no circumstances may leg irons or \nshackles or waist shackles be used on any pregnant female prisoner \nwho is in labor. Upon the pregnant female prisoner‟s entry to the \nhospital delivery room, a county correctional officer must be \nposted immediately outside the delivery room. The Sheriff must \nprovide for adequate personnel to monitor the pregnant female \nprisoner during her transport to and from the hospital and during \nher stay at the hospital.  \n \nThe Plaintiffs (Zabrowski and Jackson 08 C 6946) seek to have the class certified under Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  Plaintiffs will likely seek to join three additional parties, \nclaimants in other suits against Sheriff Dart, as class members (Bryant 09 C 1546, Embrey 09 C \n3470 and Morales 09 C 3546).  Plaintiffs define the proposed class as, “All women in the \ncustody of defendant Sheriff on and after December 4, 2006 who have been or who will be \nshackled during labor, delivery, or recovery following delivery.”  (Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Class \nCertification, CM/ECF Document 26, P. 1).  Plaintiffs do not make a facial challenge to the \nconstitutionality of the Illinois statute.  Instead Plaintiffs‟ argue the Sheriff‟s policies and \nprocedures to comply with the Illinois pregnant inmate statute, specifically in regards to each \nplaintiff‟s experience while at Stroger hospital, were unconstitutional in their application.  (See \nCM/ECF Document 26).   \n  This case turns on individual issues.  Plaintiffs and Defendant together concede the \nconstitutionality of the statute in question.  It is the constitutionality of the application of that \nIllinois statute to a particular set of events which is the issue in all four cases.  However, the \nconstitutionality of the application of a statute is a case-by-case analysis.  The purpose of a class \naction is to establish the law or facts of a multitude of significantly similar cases in a single \naction where having individual Plaintiffs would be burdensome to the judicial system.  When the \nproper analysis of the cases sought to be included in the classes all require a case-by-case \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 3 of 14 PageID #:286\nanalysis, then the purpose of declaring the class cannot be achieved.   \nFurther, Plaintiffs cannot establish numerosity as there are not so many cases involved \nthat individual treatment is not the preferred method of adjudication.  Additionally, Plaintiffs \nhave not suffered any actual injuries (physical injury, emotional injury supported by monetary \nexpense or physical manifestation, or any other kind of injury) and therefore could not be \nrepresentative of any class.  Plaintiffs are also unable to satisfy their burden on most or all of the \nremaining criteria necessary to establish class certification including: commonality, typicality, \nadequacy, predominance and superiority.  Finally, Plaintiffs‟ definition of whom to include in the \nclass is inappropriate for class certification.  Therefore, based upon the above statements and the \nfollowing supportive arguments, Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Class Certification should be denied. \nStandards for Class Certification and Review \n The Plaintiffs (Zabrowski and Jackson 08 C 6946, Bryant 09 C 1546, Embrey 09 C 3470 \nand Morales 09 C 3546) seek to have the class certified under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(3).  The Court may certify a case as a class action if the party seeking certification \ndemonstrates in a two prong inquiry that the party has met all the requirements of Rule 23(a) and \nthat the claims fall under one of the four types of class actions listed at 23(b)(1)-(3).  Under Rule \n23(a), the party must prove that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable, there are questions of law or fact common to the proposed class, the class \nrepresentatives' claims are typical of the claims of the class, and the representatives will fairly \nand adequately represent the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4).  As for the second \nprong, Plaintiffs seek to show their claims fall under the class action type defined at Rule \n23(b)(3).  To succeed, Plaintiffs must show that “questions of law or fact common to the \nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting individual members, and a class \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 4 of 14 PageID #:287\naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(emphasis added).  Plaintiffs bear “the burden of \ndemonstrating that certification is appropriate.”  Retired Chicago Police Ass'n v. City of Chicago, \n7 F.3d 584, 596 (7th Cir. 1993).  \nIn Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2001), the Seventh Circuit \nstated that, in deciding a motion for class certification, the district court should not assume that \nwhatever the plaintiff alleges is true while disregarding the fact that the defendant contests the \nplaintiff's position on “key points.”  Szabo, 249 F.3d at 674-676.  The Court should look beyond \nthe Complaint before deciding the issue of certification.  Indeed, the Eighth Amendment analysis \nand analysis of each individual application of the Illinois statute by Sheriff‟s deputies requires an \nin depth evaluation of the individualized facts of each pregnancy and each shackling incident \nmaking class treatment inappropriate.  Therefore, the Court need not rely solely on the \nallegations in plaintiffs‟ complaint in assessing whether to certify a class, but instead “should \nmake whatever factual and legal inquiries are required under Rule 23.” Id. \n  Additionally, the definition of the class in the Seventh circuit must be phrased adequately \nto allow determination of class members.  Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the class they \npropose is, in fact, identifiable as a class. Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 513 (7th Cir. \n2006).  While Rule 23 does not include a “definiteness” requirement, the Seventh Circuit has \naccepted that the definition of a proposed class must be “sufficiently definite to permit \nascertainment of the class members . . .”  Alliance to End Repression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, \n977-78 (7th Cir. 1977).  \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 5 of 14 PageID #:288\nArgument \na)  Individual Treatment is the Proper Analysis of Determining the \nConstitutionality of Statutory Applications \nStatutes are presumed constitutional.  Lockport v. Citizens for Community Action at Local \nLevel, Inc., 430 U.S. 259, 272 (1977).  The Sheriff is reasonable in relying upon the \nconstitutionality of a statute.  General Motors Corp. v. Oklahoma County Bd. Of Equalization, \n678 P.2d 233, 237 (Okla. 1983).  Therefore, the Illinois Statute § 730 ILCS 125/17.5 is \nconstitutional, and the Sheriff acted appropriately in relying upon that statute.  The Defendant \nadmits, without waiving any defenses or admitting to any liability, the particular manner in \nwhich adherence to or application of a statute as carried forth in a particular situation can be \nfound unconstitutional.  However, determining the constitutionality of the application of a statute \nto a situation is a case-by-case analysis.  Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993) quoting \nLehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 364 (1973).  Case-by-case analyses are, \nby definition, highly fact specific to the events of that case and are therefore highly \nindividualized.   \nFor instance, some of the plaintiffs mentioned above claim to have been shackled hand \nand foot throughout delivery (Ms. Jackson)(Zabrowski Complaint ¶ 15), while another claims \nonly handcuffing during delivery (Ms. Zabrowski)( Zabrowski Complaint ¶ 10), while yet \nanother claims to have been shackled only before and after delivery (Ms. Bryant)(Bryant \nComplaint ¶ 8).  Some of the plaintiffs bring claims of U.S. Treaty violation (Ms. Embry and \nMs. Morales)(Embry Complaint ¶ 7)(Morales Complaint ¶ 8) while the other three claim only \nconstitutional violations.  Four plaintiffs had vaginal deliveries while one (Ms. Embry) delivered \nthrough a cesarean procedure.  (Embry Complaint ¶ 15).  Additionally, Ms. Embry states \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 6 of 14 PageID #:289\nanesthetization while the others do not. (Embry Complaint ¶ 18).   Plaintiffs do not even all come \nfrom the same location, as some come from the MOMs program while Ms. Morales come from \nDivision 3.  (Morales Complaint ¶ 10-11).  There are many additional differences, but the point \nis that the factual specifics and the particulars of when and how each plaintiff was shackled or \nhandcuffed, as well as the particulars of the whole labor experience, differ between the various \ncomplaints.   \nConsequently, while these cases all have the common theme of shackling while pregnant, \nthat theme does not override the necessity of an individualized analysis of each application of the \nIllinois statute.  The four cases at issue here (Zabrowski and Jackson 08 C 6946, Bryant 09 C \n1546, Embrey 09 C 3470 and Morales 09 C 3546) therefore, are inappropriate for class \ncertification because there are factual differences, those factual difference require individualized \ntreatment according to precedent, and such treatment runs in stark contrast to class certification.  \nb)  Numerosity  \n \n  Rule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be so numerous that joinder of all its members is \nimpracticable. Courts may not rely on conclusory allegations as to the size of a class or the \nimpracticability of joinder and may require that a plaintiff prove class size through affidavits or \nother evidence.  Marcial v. Coronet Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 954, 957 (7th Cir. 1989); Szabo, 249 F.3d \nat 676.  The plaintiff need not specify the exact number of persons in the class. Marcial, 880 \nF.2d at 957.  However, recent Seventh Circuit precedent has determined fewer than 14 class \nmembers are not sufficient to support a certification of class status.  Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d \n788, 798 (7th Cir. 2008).  Further, “the party supporting the class cannot rely on „mere \nspeculation‟ or „conclusory allegations‟ as to the size of the putative class to prove that joinder is \nimpractical for numerosity purposes.  Roe v. Town of Highland, 909 F.2d 1097, 1100 n.4 (7th \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 7 of 14 PageID #:290\nCir. 1990). \n  In this case, Plaintiffs‟ proposed class currently consists of five detainees who were \nshackled while at Stroger Hospital, there for the purpose of giving birth from December 4, 2006.  \nPlaintiffs base their claim of numerosity on their unsupported statements to this court that they \nhave “likely more than one hundred” plaintiffs available.  (Plaintiff‟s Response to Defendant‟ \nMotion to Reassign P. 3).  However, Plaintiffs have submitted no affidavits executed by putative \nclass members, or any documentation beyond unsupported claims and postulations.  Plaintiffs \ninappropriately make assertions of the existence of enough parties to the putative class to satisfy \nthe numerosity requirement without any support for this claim.  With only five plaintiffs in four \ncases and no supporting affidavits from additional parties, the Plaintiffs fail to meet the burden of \nestablishing numerosity. \nc)  Commonality  \n \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires the existence of questions of law or fact common to the class. “A \ncommon nucleus of operative facts is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement of \nRule 23(a)(2).” Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) (quoting Rosario v. Livaditis, \n963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992)).  It may be true that when “defendant[s] have engaged in \n[identified] standardized conduct toward members of the proposed class,” the class satisfies Rule \n23(a)(2)‟s commonality requirement.  See e.g. Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589 at 594.  However, \nin cases so holding the complained of standardized conduct is not legal conduct but rather illegal \nconduct.  In this case, plaintiffs have identified no factual or legal issues common to the class \nwhich are different from those already approved by the Supreme Court.  Defendant asserts that \nthere are factual differences between the individual shackling in question which preclude a \ncommonality finding and that the identified similar facts are no more intrusive. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 8 of 14 PageID #:291\nd)  Typicality  \n \n  The typicality requirement focuses on “whether the named representatives‟ claims have \nthe same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.”  De La Fuente v. Stokely-\nVan Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983).  The representatives‟ claims are “typical if \n[they] arise from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of \nthe other class members and [their] claims are based on the same legal theory.”  De La Fuente, \n713 F. 2d at 232.  Factual distinctions between the representative parties‟ claims and the class \nmembers‟ claims do not destroy typicality so long as the claims share the same legal theory. Id.  \n  First, Plaintiffs claim to draw class members from two sources, those in the MOMs \nprogram and those originating from Division 3.  (Morales supra.).  However, considering the \nseparate origins of the proposed plaintiffs, the one source cannot be typical of the other.  \nSurprisingly, Plaintiffs would like for the court to consider the factual story of female inmates \nfrom Division 3 (the jail) sufficiently similar to women from the MOMs program (a drug \nrehabilitation program).  MOMs participants are in the rehabilitation and pregnancy program by \nelection.  They are screened, approved and placed by a process which considers, among other \nthings, past criminal behavior and violent tendencies.  Pregnant inmates remaining in Division 3 \nare there because they chose not to participate in MOMs or were ineligible do to their criminal \nrecord.  MOMs is a privileged living condition program provided by the Sheriff to help ease the \ntransition of inmates into motherhood.  Division 3 is, quite simply, jail.  The experience of these \ntwo groups, no matter the claim, cannot be typical of each other.   \n  Second, Plaintiffs have done nothing to support their claim of typicality except to point \nagain to their guesses that there are numerous pregnant inmates who went into labor at Stroger \nHospital and were shackled during that labor.  Again, Defendant argues that named plaintiffs‟ \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 9 of 14 PageID #:292\nclaims vary as to the manner in which shackling was conducted and nothing in the record \nsupports a finding that these five class representatives are typical of unknown putative class \nmembers. \ne)  Adequacy  \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the “representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). To satisfy this requirement, the interests of \nthe representative parties must coincide with those of the rest of the class, and class counsel must \nbe prepared and able to prosecute the action effectively. See Retired Police Ass'n, 7 F.3d at 598; \nLevie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 496 F. Supp. 2d 944, 950 (N.D. Ill. July 17, 2007). \n  First Plaintiffs have failed to provide affidavits sufficient to establish numerosity.  \nSecondly, Plaintiffs have failed to prove typicality of those plaintiffs already named.  Therefore, \nthis court lacks any reasonable notion as to what the situation of additional members of the \nresulting class will resemble.  This Court, therefore, has no way to determine if Plaintiffs can \nfairly and adequately represent the interest of the remaining class.  Defendant Tom Dart \nchallenges the adequacy of the named plaintiffs and contends those plaintiffs' interests are at \nodds with those of other putative class members if for no other reason than the fact that the \ninterests of the remaining class members cannot be indentified to any reasonable degree. \nf)  Rule 23(b)(3): Predominance and Superiority  \n \n  Even if Plaintiffs could establish all aspects of Rule 23(a)(1)-(4), Plaintiffs‟ class still \nfails because Plaintiffs cannot complete the second prong of class certification: establishing that \nPlaintiffs‟ claim falls under the class type indentified under Rule 23(b)(3).  Rule 23(b)(3) \nrequires the Court to find “that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that the class action is \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 10 of 14 PageID #:293\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(emphasis added).  Generally, when a class challenges a uniform policy \nor practice, the validity of the policy or practice tends to be the predominant issue in the ensuing \nlitigation.  See General Telephone Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 159 n.15, 102 \nS. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982) (“Significant proof that an employer operated under a \ngeneral policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and \nemployees.”); Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding that \ncertification was appropriate when plaintiffs alleged that defendant had “an ongoing scheme to \ndefraud and deceive prospective students”).  The motion in this case alleges the manner in which \nSheriff‟s Deputies complied with General Order 32 was a violation of Illinois Statute § 730 ILCS \n125/17.5  regarding the shackling of pregnant inmates in labor and therefore was an Eighth \nAmendment constitutional violation regarding cruel or unusual punishment. \nAs mentioned above state statutes are presumed constitutional.  Lockport 430 U.S. at 272.  \nThe Sheriff is reasonable in relying upon the constitutionality of a statute.  General Motors Corp. \n678 P.2d at 237.  Therefore, the Illinois Statute § 730 ILCS 125/17.5 is presumed constitutional, \nand Sheriff Deputies acted appropriately in relying upon that statute and the manner in which it \nwas enforced.  However, the analysis of the application of a statute to a situation is a case-by-\ncase analysis.  Heller 509 U.S. at 320 (quoting Lehnhausen, 410 U.S. at 364).  Such case-by-case \nanalyses are highly fact specific to the events of that case and are therefore highly individualized.  \nThe four cases at issue here (Zabrowski, Bryant, Embrey and Morales) therefore, are \ninappropriate for class certification because highly individualized factual analyses run in stark \ncontrast to class certification.  Plaintiffs are unable to meet their burden to show a predominating \nquestion of fact or law to establish the class considering the proper inquiry into each allegation is \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 11 of 14 PageID #:294\nan individualized case-by-case analysis.  \n  In addition to failing to establish questions of law or fact common to the members of the \nclass which predominate over individual factual analysis; plaintiffs also fail to show superiority. \nPlaintiffs must show that the class action method is superior to other available methods for the \nfair and efficient adjudication of the issues.  Plaintiffs have merely guessed that the class size is \nlikely more than 100 persons.  There is simply no justifiable reason that a class action is a \nsuperior venue to adjudicate the claims of five individuals.  These plaintiffs have already filed \ntheir individual suits, wherein they can receive a proper and individualized assessment of the \nconstitutional violation they allege.   \nGiven that the Court is allowed to look beyond the complaint when determining class \ncertification, it is relevant to consider Plaintiffs‟ counsel history.  Bringing these class actions \ncould simply be part of a Morrissey-Flaxman business plan motivated solely by fees and not the \nvindication of fundamental rights.  The difficulty of certifying a class here is that a $1,000.00-\n$10,000.00 case (taking into consideration that Plaintiffs have suffered no physical injury and \nhave to date incurred no expense for mental injury) quickly becomes a $10,000,000.00 - \n$100,000,000.00 case.  This is precisely why the Seventh Circuit permits review of certification \ndecisions.  Such a claim puts a bet-your-company decision to the Cook County Board and may \ninduce a substantial settlement even if the Plaintiffs‟ position is weak.  The pressure that class \ncertification places on the defendant, and the ensuing settlement, prevents resolution of the \nunderlying issues.  See Szabo, 249 F.3d at 675. \n  The motion is silent on the “fair and efficient” adjudication prongs.  There is no showing \nof any “mad rush to the courthouse” to file shackling cases and it‟s because there is no real injury \nfrom such restraint.  It is true that none of the currently named plaintiffs suffered any physical or \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 12 of 14 PageID #:295\nactual damages.  In terms of efficiency, plaintiffs argue that one case is better than hundreds, but \nthose hundreds are not being brought. In terms of fairness, the Szabo case points out how unfair \nit is to a defendant to end up settling an otherwise non-meritorious case because of the risk of an \neven larger judgment.  Therefore, Defendants state that allowing Plaintiffs‟ class is neither fair \nnor efficient. \ng)  Class Definition \nThe purported class as defined by Plaintiffs states, “All women in the custody of \ndefendant Sheriff on and after December 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled during \nlabor, delivery, or recovery following delivery.”  This definition is unworkable. \nFirst, the class definition is inappropriate because the definition seeks to include \nhypothetical and future plaintiffs when it states “have been or who will be shackled.”  In order to \nhave a claim, a plaintiff must first have been in involved in a transaction or occurrence and then \nsuffered an injury from that transaction or occurrence.  However, in the class definition, \nPlaintiffs seek to include unknown and hypothetical plaintiff who have yet to suffer any incident, \nmuch less the injury.  If Plaintiffs were concerned that the events occurring to them would \ncontinue to occur in the future to others, then such a claim is properly brought as an injunction.  \nPlaintiffs‟ definition leaves the inference that Plaintiff expects the Sheriff‟s behavior to continue \nunaltered, and rather than enjoin that behavior, Plaintiffs seek to find new parties to join \nPlaintiff‟s lawsuit.  Regardless of the intent, it is improper to seek to join future tort victims as \nsuch a status under the law does not exist. \n   Secondly, Plaintiffs‟ class definition is inaccurate because a class is not identifiable if an \nextensive search of individual records is necessary to identify that class.  If individual inquiry \nneeds to be made to identify a claim of the proposed class, the definition is deficient.  Lau v. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 13 of 14 PageID #:296\nArrow Fin. Servs., LLC, 245 F.R.D. 620, 624 (N.D. Ill. September 28, 2007).  Such inquiry \nneeds to be made on each member of the purported class as defined by Plaintiffs and is \nextremely burdensome in terms of time and dollars spent pulling files, finding information in the \nfiles, and making copies of the information or recording the information elsewhere.  The Jail‟s \nCIMIS system cannot and does not determine who was pregnant.  Even if the CIMIS did \ndetermine such things, that information is restricted by HIPAA.   \n  The Sherriff‟s department has already spent significant man hours and expense locating \nun-centralized records for documents for the current five named plaintiffs and for documents \nwhich would reveal the names of potential class members.  Class Counsel may offer sworn \ndeclarations from putative class members but has failed to do so.  Therefore, class certification is \nneither fair nor efficient in this case.  \nConclusion \n  WHEREFORE, the MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION should be denied for \nfailure to meet any one the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) as numerosity, typicality, commonality \nand adequacy of representation are lacking. Further, no identifiable issues of law or fact exist as \nplaintiffs have only enunciated one fact issue and that issue must be analyzed on a case-by-case \nbasis.  Finally, class certification is neither the superior, nor fair method of evaluation since no \nissues of fact predominate over individual questions, thus requiring case by case analysis.  For \nthese reasons and all others listed above, the Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Class Certification should be \ndenied.   \n             \n \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 44 Filed: 08/31/09 Page 14 of 14 PageID #:297\n            Respectfully submitted, \n            ANITA ALVAREZ \n            State's Attorney of Cook County \n          By:  /s/ Pat Smith   \n            Pat Smith \nDeputy Supervisor of Federal Litigation  \nCook County State‟s Attorney \nRichard J.

This  is  a  civil  action  arising  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983.  The \njurisdiction  of  this  Court  is  conferred  by  28  U.S.  C.  §1343  and  28  U.S.C. \n§1367. \n2.  Plaintiffs  Catherine  Zaborowski  and  Simone  Jackson  are \nresidents of the Northern District of Illinois.  As set out below with greater \n \n  1 \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 13 Filed: 01/28/09 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:21\nspecificity, each plaintiff was in the custody of the Sheriff of Cook County \nimmediately before and immediately after she gave birth at Stroger Hospital. \n3.  Defendants  are  the  Sheriff  of  Cook  County  and  Cook  County, \nIllinois. The Sheriff is sued in his official capacity only; the County is joined \npursuant to Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle County, 324 F. 3d 947 (7th Cir. 2003). \n4.  Plaintiff  Zaborowski  entered  the  Cook  County  Jail  on  June  3, \n2008; plaintiff Jackson entered the Jail on November 23, 2007.   \n5.  Each plaintiff was pregnant when she entered the jail. \n6.  Pursuant to the policies of defendant Sheriff, each plaintiff was \ntransferred  from  the  Jail  to  the  Sheriff’s  “MOM’s”  program,  an  off-site, \nresidential treatment program run by the Haymarket Center. \n7.   Plaintiff Zaborowski went into labor on August 29, 2008 and was \ntaken  by  a  counselor  from  the  Haymarket  Center  to  Stroger  Hospital. \nZaborowski was not handcuffed or otherwise restrained while she was being \ntaken to the hospital.  \n8.  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance with \nthe policies of defendants, deputy sheriffs shackled plaintiff Zaborowski hand \nand foot to a hospital bed.    \n \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 13 Filed: 01/28/09 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:22\n9.  Plaintiff  Zaborowski  remained  shackled  hand  and  foot  to  the \nhospital bed for about eleven hours while she was in labor.  An armed deputy \nsheriff remained in the hospital room while plaintiff was in labor. \n10.   Immediately before the birth, the attending physician requested \nthe  deputy  sheriff  to  unshackle  plaintiff  Zaborowski’s  foot.    The  deputy \ncomplied with this request and Zaborowski was shackled to the bed by one \narm when she delivered her child at about 8:15 a.m. on August 30, 2008. \n11.  In accordance with the policies of defendants, the deputy sheriff \nre-shackled plaintiff Zaborowski’s foot about an hour after the birth. \n12.  Plaintiff  Zaborowski  remained  at  Stroger  Hospital  until  the \nevening  of  the  next  day,  September  1,  2008.    During  this  period,  and  as \nrequired by defendants’ policies, Zaborowski was shackled hand and foot to \nthe hospital bed and was not permitted to use the toilet or to get up from the \nbed to walk  \n13.  Plaintiff Jackson went into labor on May 3, 2008 and was taken \nby her counselor from the Haymarket Center to Stroger Hospital. Jackson was \nnot  handcuffed  or  otherwise  restrained  while  she  was  being  taken  to  the \nhospital.  \n \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 13 Filed: 01/28/09 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:23\n14.  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance with \nthe policies of defendants, deputy sheriffs shackled plaintiff Jackson hand and \nfoot to a hospital bed.    \n15.  Plaintiff Jackson remained shackled hand and foot to the hospital \nbed  while  she  was  in  labor  and  during  birth.    An  armed  deputy  sheriff \nremained in the hospital room while plaintiff was in labor and was present \nwhen plaintiff delivered her child while shackled. \n16.  Plaintiff  Jackson  remained  at  Stroger  Hospital  for  about  four \ndays.  During this period, and as required by defendants’ policies, Jackson was \nshackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was not permitted to use the \ntoilet or to get up from the bed to walk. \n17.  Each  plaintiff  was  deprived  of  rights  secured  by  the  Fourth, \nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nby defendants’ above described shackling policy.   \n18.  At  all  times  relevant,  there  was  in  force  and  effect  an  Illinois \nstatute compiled as 55 ILCS 5/3-15003.6 which provided as follows: \nPregnant  female  prisoners.  Notwithstanding  any  other \nstatute, directive, or administrative regulation, when a pregnant \nfemale  prisoner  is  brought  to  a  hospital  from  a  County \nDepartment of Corrections facility for the purpose of delivering \nher baby, no handcuffs, shackles, or restraints of any kind may be \nused during her transport to a medical facility for the purpose of \n \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 13 Filed: 01/28/09 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:24\ndelivering her baby.  Under no circumstances may leg irons or \nshackles  or  waist  shackles  be  used  on  any  pregnant  female \nprisoner who is in labor.  Upon the pregnant female prisoner's \nentry to the hospital delivery room, a county correctional officer \nmust  be  posted  immediately  outside  the  delivery  room.    The \nSheriff  must  provide  for  adequate  personnel  to  monitor  the \npregnant female prisoner during her transport to and from the \nhospital and during her stay at the hospital. \n \n19.  Defendants have failed  and or refused  to implement  the  above \nreferred Illinois statute.  \n20.  Each plaintiff was damaged as the direct and proximate result of \ndefendants’ failure and or refusal to implement the above referred  Illinois \nstatute.  \n21.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ shackling policy,   \nand  by  defendants  failure  and  or  refusal  to  implement  the  above  referred \nIllinois statute, plaintiffs and all other persons subjected to the above referred \npolicy were unreasonably restrained, subjected to punishment, incurred great \nemotional and physical pain and suffering. \n22.  Plaintiffs bring this action individually and for all women in the \ncustody of defendant Sheriff who, in the two year period preceding the filing of \nthis lawsuit, were shackled during labor and after delivery.  The proposed \nclass satisfies each of the requirements of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and class certification is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(3). \n \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 13 Filed: 01/28/09 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:25\n23.  Plaintiffs hereby demand trial by jury. \n Wherefore plaintiffs request that judgment be entered in their favor \nand in favor of the proposed class, and that plaintiffs and each class member \nreceive  compensatory  damages  in  an  amount  in  excess  of  one  hundred \nthousand dollars, and that the Court grant whatsoever other relief as may be \nappropriate. \n  \nThomas G.

      "text": "Order Form (01/2005)\nUnited States District Court, Northern District of Illinois\nName of Assigned Judge Amy J. St. Eve Sitting Judge if Other\nor Magistrate Judge than Assigned Judge\nCASE NUMBER 08 C 6946 DATE 12/29/2010\nCASE Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al\nTITLE\nDOCKET ENTRY TEXT\nThe Court denies Defendant Dart's motion to dismiss [140].\nO[ For further details see text below.] Notices mailed by Judicial staff.\nSTATEMENT\n           On September 21, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint alleging that Defendants\nThomas J. Dart, the Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois and Cook County, Illinois violated their constitutional\nrights based on Defendants’ policy of shackling female pre-trial detainees at the Cook County Department of\nCorrections (“CCDOC”) before, during, and immediately after they give birth.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nPlaintiffs are suing Sheriff Dart in both his official and individual capacities.  Before the Court is Defendant\nDart’s motion to dismiss the claims brought against him in his individual capacity.  For the following\nreasons, the Court denies Defendant Dart’s motion.\nBACKGROUND\nIn their Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Sheriff “Dart has at all times been\npersonally involved in the formulation and implementation of policies at the Cook County Jail.”  (R. 131,\nSecond Am. Compl. ¶ 5.)  Plaintiffs further allege that Sheriff Dart has permitted the continuation of the\nofficial shackling policy that requires correctional officers to shackle pregnant woman in the custody of the\nSheriff of Cook County before, during, and immediately after labor and delivery.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Moreover,\nPlaintiffs allege that Sheriff Dart’s “shackling policy implements a barbaric practice that needlessly inflicts\nexcruciating pain and humiliation.”  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Plaintiffs also state that Sheriff Dart enforced the shackling\npolicy in willful and wanton disregard of the laws of the State of Illinois, specifically, 55 ILCS 5/3-15003.6. \n(Id. ¶ 8.) \n Courtroom Deputy KF\nInitials:\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al Page 1 of  3\n\n            In addition, Plaintiffs maintain that at some time after December 1, 2007, Sheriff Dart\nlearned that the widespread practice at the Cook County Jail was that pregnant female detainees would be: (1)\nshackled while being transported to a hospital for labor and delivery; (2) shackled during labor and delivery;\nand/or (3) shackled during recovery after labor.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiffs further allege that notwithstanding his\nactual knowledge of this unlawful and unconstitutional policy, Sheriff Dart waited more than one year to take\nremedial action concerning the shackling policy.  (Id. ¶¶ 12, 13.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD\n“A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted.”  Hallinan v. Fraternal Order of Police of Chicago Lodge No. 7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th\nCir. 2009).  Pursuant to Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must include “a short and plain statement of the claim showing\nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  As the Seventh Circuit explains, this “[r]ule reflects\na liberal notice pleading regime, which is intended to ‘focus litigation on the merits of a claim’ rather than on\ntechnicalities that might keep plaintiffs out of court.”  Brooks v. Ross, 578 F.3d 574, 580 (7th Cir. 2009) (quoting\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002)).  The short and plain\nstatement under Rule 8(a)(2) must “give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon\nwhich it rests.”  Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quoting\nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)).  Under the federal notice pleading\nstandards, a plaintiff’s “factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Put differently, a “complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,\nto ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  “[W]hen ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of\nthe factual allegations contained in the complaint.”  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167\nL.Ed.2d 1081 (2007); McGowan v. Hulick, 612 F.3d 636, 638 (7th Cir. 2010) (courts accept factual allegations as\ntrue and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor).  \nANALYSIS\nIn his motion to dismiss, Sheriff Dart maintains that Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning his personal\ninvolvement are conclusory and baseless, and thus the Court should dismiss this claim.  To clarify, to recover\ndamages under Section 1983, a plaintiff must establish that the individual defendant was personally responsible\nfor the constitutional violation.  See Minix v. Canarecci, 597 F.3d 824, 834 (7th Cir. 2010); Knight v. Wiseman,\n590 F.3d 458, 462-63 (7th Cir. 2009).  Specifically, a “plaintiff bringing a civil rights action must prove that the\ndefendant personally participated in or caused the unconstitutional actions.” Grieveson v. Anderson, 538 F.3d\n763, 776 (7th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  Meanwhile, “a supervisor is not liable for the acts of her subordinates\nunder § 1983 unless she was aware of and approved her employees’ conduct.”  Sides v. City of Champaign, 496\nF.3d 820, 827 (7th Cir. 2007); see also Minix, 597 F.3d at 834 (supervisor must have condoned or acquiesced in\nsubordinate’s unconstitutional treatment).\nFirst, viewing the allegations and all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs’ favor, they have alleged sufficient\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face, thus giving Sheriff Dart fair notice of their claims and\nthe grounds upon which they rest.  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570.  More specifically, Plaintiffs have alleged\nthat Sheriff Dart was personally involved in the formulation and implementation of policies at the Cook County\nJail and that he permitted the continuation of the shackling policy.  In addition, Plaintiffs maintain that at some\ntime after December 1, 2007, Sheriff Dart learned of the shackling policy at the Cook County Jail, yet despite his\nactual knowledge of the policy, he waited more than a year to take remedial action.  In sum, these allegations\nsufficiently allege that Sheriff Dart personally participated in or was involved in the implementation or\nadministration of the shackling policy.  See Grieveson, 538 F.3d at 776.\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al Page 2 of  3\n\nSecond, Sheriff Dart also argues that based on discovery in this matter, including four Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 30(b)(6) depositions and sworn interrogatories, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted because Sheriff Dart has refuted the allegation that he was personally involved in the\nshackling policy.  At this juncture, however, Defendant’s argument is without merit because “a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion must be decided solely on the face of the complaint and any attachments that accompanied its filing.” \nMiller v. Herman, 600 F.3d 726, 733 (7th Cir. 2010) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c)).  “[D]ocuments attached to a\nmotion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff’s complaint and are\ncentral to his claim.”  E.E.O.C. v. Concentra Health Serv., Inc., 496 F.3d 773, 778 (7th Cir. 2007) (citation\nomitted).\nHere, Defendant has failed to attach the Rule 30(b)(6) depositions to his motion to dismiss, although he\nreproduces one interrogatory answer in his brief.  The Court, however, cannot consider the interrogatory answer\nas part of the pleadings because Plaintiffs make no reference to Defendant’s interrogatory answers in their Second\nAmended Complaint.  See Concentra Health, 496 F.3d at 778.  Moreover, the Court will not convert this Rule\n12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment based on one interrogatory answer that is factually\ndisputed.  See Hecker v. Deere & Co., 556 F.3d 575, 583 (7th Cir. 2009) (district court has discretion when\ndeciding whether to convert a defendant’s motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment); McCready v.\neBay, Inc., 453 F.3d 882, 891-92 (7th Cir. 2006) (attached documents cannot contain facts in dispute).  Instead,\nDefendant Dart’s personal involvement argument is best left for summary judgment when the parties can fully\nbrief this issue and present evidence pursuant to Northern District of Illinois Local Rule 56.1.  Accordingly, the\nCourt denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss.  \n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al Page 3 of  3",

This  is  a  civil  action  arising  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is conferred by 28 U.S. C. §1343. \n2.  Plaintiffs  Catherine  Zaborowski  and  Simone  Jackson  are \nresidents of the Northern District of Illinois.  As set out below with greater \nspecificity,  each plaintiff was in the custody of the  Sheriff of Cook  County \nimmediately before and immediately after  she gave birth at Stroger Hospital. \n1 \n\nC3.a se: 1D:0e8f-ecnv-d0a6n9t4s6  Daroec umtheen t S#h: 1e rFifilef do: f1 2C/0o4o/0k8  CPaoguen 2ty o fa 5n Pda gCeoIDo k# :2County, \nIllinois. The Sheriff is sued in his official capacity only; the County is joined \npursuant to Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle County, 324 F. 3d 94 7 (7th Cir. 2003). \n4.  Plaintiff Zaborowski  entered the  Cook  County  Jail on  June  3, \n2008; plaintiff Jackson entered the Jail on November 23, 2007. \n5.  Each plaintiff was pregnant when she entered the jail. \n6.  Pursuant to the policies of defendant Sheriff,  each plaintiff was \ntransferred  from  the  Jail  to  the  Sheriffs  \"MOM's\"  program,  an  off-site, \nresidential treatment program run by the Haymarket Center. \n7.  Plaintiff Zaborowski went into labor on August 29, 2008 and was \ntaken  by  a  counselor  from  the  Haymarket  Center  to  Stroger  Hospital. \nZaborowski was not handcuffed or otherwise restrained while she was being \ntaken to the hospital. \n8.  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance with \nthe policies of defendants, deputy sheriffs shackled plaintiff Zaborowski hand \nand foot to a hospital bed. \n9.  Plaintiff Zaborowski  remained  shackled  hand  and  foot  to  the \nhospital bed for about eleven hours while she was in labor.  An armed deputy \nsheriff remained in the hospital room while plaintiff was in labor. \n2 \nr \n,' -l \n\\~ \n-- ~ \n\n1C0a.s e: 1I:m08m-cev-d0i6a9t4e6ly D boecfuomree ntt h#e:  1b Firiltehd,:  1th2e/0 4a/t0t8e nPdagineg 3  pohf 5y sPiacgiaenID  r#e:q3uested \nthe  deputy  sheriff to  unshackle  plaintiff  Zaborowski's  foot.

In accordance with the policies of defendants, the deputy sheriff \nre-shackled plaintiff Zaborowski's foot about an hour after the birth. \n12.  Plaintiff  Zaborowski  remained  at  Stroger  Hospital  until  the \nevening of the  next  day,  September  1,  2008.  During this  period,  and  as \nrequired by defendants' policies,  Zaborowski was shackled hand and foot to \nthe hospital bed and was not permitted to use the toilet or to get up from the \nbed to walk \n13.  Plaintiff Jackson went into labor on May 3,  2008 and was taken \nby her counselor from the Haymarket Center to Stroger Hospital. Jackson was \nnot  handcuffed  or  otherwise  restrained  while  she  was  being  taken to  the \nhospital. \n14.

An  armed  deputy  sheriff \nremained in the hospital room while plaintiff was in labor and was present \nwhen plaintiff delivered her child while shackled. \n16.  Plaintiff Jackson  remained  at  Stroger  Hospital  for  about  four \ndays.  During this period, and as required by defendants' policies, Jackson was \nshackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was not permitted to use the \ntoilet or to get up from the bed to walk. \n17.  Each  plaintiff  was  deprived  of  rights  secured  by  the  Fourth, \nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nby defendants' above described shackling policy. \n18.

Introduction \nIt its order of December 9, 2009 denying plaintiffs’ initial request for \nclass certification, the Court concluded that the proposed class satisfied \nthe numerosity, typicality, and commonality requirements of Rule 23(a). \n(Order,  Dec.  9,  2009,  3-4.)  The  Court  recognized  that  plaintiffs  were \nrepresented by “qualified counsel” (Order, Dec. 9, 2009, 4), but held that \nthe named plaintiffs could not adequately represent the class because of \n“their request to reserve individual damages claims for subsequent law-\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 2 of 35 PageID #:587\nsuits.” (Order, Dec. 9, 2009, 5.) Similarly, the Court held that the class “as \nproposed” (Order, Dec. 9, 2009 at 5, emphasis added), did not satisfy Rule \n23(b)(3) because “any efficiencies gained from consolidating the question of \nthe Sheriff’s liability do not outweigh the fact that 49 separate plaintiffs \nmay file subsequent damages lawsuits based on the same common facts.” \n(Order, Dec. 9, 2009 at 6.) \nPlaintiffs now propose a different class. Plaintiffs do not seek to limit \nthe class to liability, but request that the case be maintained as a class ac-\ntion pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) to adjudicate liability and damages for all \nclass members. Plaintiffs demonstrate below that the Court should grant \ntheir amended motion for class certification. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ “Right to Have a Class Certified” \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a litigant to \n“bring his [or her] claim as a class if he [or she] wishes.” Shady Grove Or-\nthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 130 S.Ct. 1431, 1438 (2010). \nUpon showing that the case satisfies the requirements of Rule 23, “the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure give the proposed class representative \nthe right to have a class certified.” United States Parole Commission v. \nGeraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 403 (1980). While Rule 23(b) begins that “[a] class \naction may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied,” the permissive “may” \n-2- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 3 of 35 PageID #:588\nrefers to the plaintiff, rather than to the court: “The discretion suggested \nby Rule 23’s ‘may’ is discretion residing in the plaintiff.” Shady Grove Or-\nthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 130 S.Ct. at 1438. Rule 23 \n“empowers a federal court ‘to certify a class in each and every case’ where \nthe Rule’s criteria are met.” Id. Moreover, Rule 23 “creates a categorical \nrule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue \nhis claim as a class action.” Id. at 1437. Plaintiffs show below that their \namended motion for class certification satisfies each criteria of Rule 23(a) \nand Rule 23(b)(3). \nIII.  Facts \nEach year, more than 30 women give birth while in the custody of \nthe Sheriff of Cook County.  \nIn 1998, the Sheriff adopted a policy mandating that all pregnant \nwomen in his custody be shackled during labor and during recovery follow-\ning labor. The Sheriff’s shackling policy requires a Deputy Sheriff to bind \none leg and one arm of the pregnant detainee to her hospital bed. The poli-\ncy also requires an armed Deputy Sheriff to remain with the pregnant de-\ntainee during labor and delivery.  \nThe Court summarized the facts of each of the named plaintiffs in its \norder of December 9, 2009 at 1-2: \n-3- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 4 of 35 PageID #:589\nIn their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Zaborows-\nki entered the Cook County Jail on June 3, 2008 and that Jack-\nson entered the Jail on November 23, 2007. (R. 13-1, Amend. \nCompl. ¶ 4.) At the time they entered the Cook County Jail, \nboth Zaborowski and Jackson were pregnant. (Id. ¶ 5.) Plain-\ntiffs further allege that they were transferred from the Cook \nCounty Jail to the Sheriff’s “MOM’s” program, which is an off-\nsite,  residential  treatment  program  run  by  the  Haymarket \nCenter. (Id. ¶ 6.) \nZaborowski went into labor on August 29, 2008, and her coun-\nselor from the Haymarket Center transported her to Stroger \nHospital. (Id. ¶ 7.) Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, \nand  in  accordance  with  Defendant’s  policy,  deputy  sheriffs \nshackled Zaborowski’s hand and foot to the hospital bed. (Id. ¶ \n8.) Zaborowski remained shackled hand and foot to the hospit-\nal bed for about eleven hours while she was in labor. (Id. ¶ 9.) \nAn armed deputy sheriff remained in the hospital room during \nthat time. (Id.) Immediately before giving birth, the attending \nphysician requested that the deputy sheriff unshackle Zabo-\nrowski’s foot. (Id. ¶ 10.) The deputy sheriff complied with the \ndoctor’s request and Zaborowski was shackled to the bed by \none arm when she delivered her child on August 30, 2008. (Id.) \nPlaintiffs further allege that in accordance with the Sheriff’s \npolicy, the deputy sheriff then re-shackled Zaborowski’s foot \nabout an hour after she gave birth. (Id. ¶ 11.) Zaborowski re-\nmained at Stroger Hospital until the evening of the next day, \nSeptember 1, 2008. (Id. ¶ 12.) During this time period, Zabo-\nrowski was shackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was \nnot permitted to use the toilet or to get up from the bed to \nwalk. (Id.) \nAfter Jackson went into labor on May 3, 2008, her counselor \nfrom the Haymarket Center took her to Stroger Hospital. (Id. \n¶ 13.) Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accor-\ndance  with  the  Sheriff’s  policies,  deputy  sheriffs  shackled \nJackson’s hand and foot to the hospital bed. (Id. ¶ 14.) Jackson \nremained shackled hand and foot while she was in labor and \nduring birth. (Id. ¶ 15.) An armed deputy sheriff remained in \nthe hospital room while she was in labor and delivered her \nchild. (Id.) Jackson remained at Stroger Hospital for approx-\n-4- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 5 of 35 PageID #:590\nimately four days during which Jackson was shackled hand \nand foot to the hospital bed and was not permitted to use the \ntoilet or to get up from the bed to walk per the Sheriff’s poli-\ncies. (Id. ¶ 16.)  \nIn May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876 (7th Cir. 2000), this Court held that \nthe  Sheriff’s  policy  requiring  that  all  hospital  detainees  be  shackled  to \ntheir beds was “plainly excessive” as applied to an AIDS patient. Id. at \n884. The Court reaffirmed this holding in Hart v. Sheahan, 396 F.3d 887 \n(7th Cir. 2005), where it cited May for the proposition that “the use of bodi-\nly restraints constitutes punishment in the constitutional sense if their use \nis not rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive government purpose \nor they appear excessive in relation to the purpose they allegedly serve.” \nId. at 892. The question presented in this case is whether the use of bodily \nrestraints on a pregnant woman during labor, delivery, or recovery follow-\ning delivery is “rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive government \npurpose.” As set out below, this question should be decided in one fell \nswoop in a Rule 23(b)(3) class action. \nIV.  The Proposed Class Continues to Satisfy the Nume-\nrosity, Typicality, and Commonality Requirements of \nRule 23(a) \nPlaintiffs supported their initial class motion with a list identifying \n49 members of the putative class. (Order, Dec. 9, 2009, 3.) Five of those \n-5- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 6 of 35 PageID #:591\nwomen have since filed individual cases.1 Plaintiffs have identified an addi-\ntional 15 members of the putative class, identified in Exhibit 1. In accor-\ndance with the principles the Court applied in its order of December 9, \n2009, the proposed class therefore continues to satisfy the numerosity re-\nquirement of Rule 23(a). \nNothing has changed pertaining to the commonality and typicality \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) since entry of the Court’s order of December 9, \n2009. For the reasons set out by the Court in its order of December 9, 2009 \nat 3-4, the proposed class continues to satisfy the commonality and typical-\nity requirements of Rule 23(a).  \nV.  The Amended Request for Class Certification Elimi-\nnates any Conflicts between the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe Class \nThe  Court  concluded  in  its  order  of  December  9,  2009  that  the \nnamed plaintiffs “do not adequately protect the interests of the putative \nclass members due to their request to reserve individual damage claims for \nsubsequent lawsuits.” (Order, Dec. 9, 2009, 5.) Plaintiffs do not make any \nsuch request in their amended class motion. \nThe adequate representation requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) “serves to \nuncover conflicts of interests between named parties and the class they \n                                              \n1 Farrar v. Dart, 10-cv-00333; Fletcher v. Dart, 10-cv-00139; Lee v. Dart, 09 CV \n789; Smith v. Dart, 09-cv-7791; Vitirriti v. Dart, 09-cv-7792. \n-6- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 7 of 35 PageID #:592\nseek to represent.” Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 594 \n(1997). As this Court stated in Silversman v. Motorola, Inc., 259 F.R.D. \n163 (N.D.Ill. 2009), “[t]o establish that they will fairly and adequately pro-\ntect the interests of the class, class representatives must show that: (1) \ntheir claims are not antagonistic to or in conflict with those of the proposed \nclass; (2) they have sufficient interest in the outcome of the case; and (3) \nexperienced,  competent  counsel  represents  them.”  Id.  at  173.  The  pro-\nposed class satisfies each of these requirements. \nThe named plaintiffs seek damages on the same theory asserted on \nbehalf of the proposed class. Each of the named plaintiffs therefore “pos-\nsess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.” \nUhl v. Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc., 309 F.3d \n978, 985, quoting East Texas Motor Freight v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 \n(1977). “In short, there are no inconsistencies between [the named plain-\ntiffs’ claim] and the class members’ claims.” Harris v. Best Buy Co., Inc., \n254 F.R.D. 82, 88 (N.D.Ill. 2008). The named plaintiffs therefore satisfy the \nfirst two prongs of the adequacy of representation requirement. \nThe named plaintiffs also satisfy the third prong of the adequacy \nrequirement: the Court observed in its order of December 9, 2009 that “[i]t \nis undisputed that Plaintiffs’ counsel is qualified.” (Order, Dec. 9, 2009, 4.) \n-7- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 8 of 35 PageID #:593\nThus, as in Harris v. Best Buy Co., Inc., supra, the Court should conclude \nthat plaintiffs have “fulfilled the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) \nbecause [their] claim is not antagonistic to the proposed class’ claims, [they \nhave  an]  interest  in  the  outcome  of  the  case,  and  [their]  counsel  is \nexperienced and competent.” 254 F.R.D. at 88. \nVI.  The Revised Class Satisfies the Requirements \nof Rule 23(b)(3) \nRule 23(b)(3) permits a case to proceed as a class action when \n(3) [T]he court finds that the questions of law or fact com-\nmon  to  the  members  of  the  class  predominate  over  any \nquestions  affecting  only  individual  members,  and  that  a \nclass action is superior to other available methods for fair \nand efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters \npertinent to the finding include:  \n(A)   the interest of members of the class in individually \ncontrolling the prosecution or defense  of separate \nactions;  \n(B)   the extent and nature of any litigation concerning \nthe controversy already commenced by or against \nmembers of the class; \n(C)   the  desirability  or  undesirability  of  concentrating \nthe litigation of the claims in the particular forum; \n(D)   the difficulties likely to be encountered in the man-\nagement of a class action. \n1.  Predominance \n“When determining if a plaintiff has met the predominance require-\nment, district courts look beyond the pleadings to determine whether the \n-8- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 9 of 35 PageID #:594\nplaintiff’s claims are subject to class-wide proof by common evidence.” Sie-\ngel v. Shell Oil Co., No. 06-35, N.D.Ill, Feb. 23, 2009, at 5, attached as Ex-\nhibit 2. In this case, adjudicating the legality of the Sheriff’s alleged shack-\nling policy will not require any individual determinations. \nPlaintiffs allege that defendant Sheriff requires that all pregnant \nwomen in his custody be shackled during labor and during recovery follow-\ning  labor.  (Amended  Complaint,  ¶17.)  The  Sheriff  admitted  at  a  Rule \n30(b)(6) deposition that when a pregnant female detainee comes to a hos-\npital for childbirth, she will go through labor with one leg shackled to the \nhospital bed and one of her hands cuffed to the bed.2 (Exhibit 3 at 7-9, \nHickerson Deposition 43:11-45:7.) Plaintiffs’ theory of the case is that this \nshackling is unconstitutional under May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876 (7th Cir. \n2000).  \nPlaintiffs  will  thus  “offer  proof  on  a  class-wide  basis.”  Hyderi  v. \nWashington Mutual Bank, FA, 235 F.R.D. 390, 398 (N.D.Ill. 2006). As the \ndistrict court concluded in Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 219 F.R.D. \n607 (W.D.Wis. 2003), “the case law suggests that when the class is chal-\nlenging a uniform policy, the validity of that policy predominates over in-\n                                              \n2 The Rule 30(b)(6) witness did not know if any changes had been made in shack-\nling women assigned to the “MOM’s” program. Exhibit 3 at 5, Hickerson Deposi-\ntion 41:6.  \n-9- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 10 of 35 PageID #:595\ndividual issues and class certification is appropriate.” Id. at 620. According-\nly,  the  amended  class  satisfies  the  predominance  requirement  of  Rule \n23(b)(3). \n2.  Superiority \nPlaintiffs’ counsel originally believed that an individual proceeding \nof some sort would be required to determine the amount of damages for \neach woman aggrieved by the shackling policy. On this basis, counsel pro-\nposed that the case be maintained as a class limited to liability.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are now attorneys of record in nine cases challeng-\ning the shackling policy.3 Counsel have interviewed and been retained by \nother woman aggrieved by the challenged policy and have concluded that, \nunless a plaintiff can show that the shackling caused harm to the child, the \ndamages in each case will be established by testimony from the shackling \nvictim of the shock, panic, depression, shame, rage, and humiliation caused \nby being shackled during labor, delivery, or recovery following delivery.4 \nOnce the common liability question is determined, damages for each class-\nmember could be resolved through a series of multiple-plaintiff trials, as in \n                                              \n3 In addition to this case and the five cases enumerated in note 1 above, counsel \nare attorneys of record in Embrey v. Sheriff, 09 CV 3470, Morales v. Sheriff, 09 \nCV 3546, and Bryant v. Sheriff, 09 CV 1546. \n4 No claim of injury to the child has come to light in our interviews of women ag-\ngrieved by the Sheriff’s shackling policy.  \n-10- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 11 of 35 PageID #:596\nJenkins v.

Conclusion \nFor the reasons above stated, the Court should order that this case \nbe maintained as a class action on behalf of: \nAll women in the custody of defendant Sheriff on and after \nDecember 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled dur-\ning labor, delivery, or recovery following delivery. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/  Kenneth N.

ST. EVE, District Court Judge:\nIn his Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiff Michael Siegel alleges that Defendants\nShell Oil Company, BP Corporation North America, Inc., Citgo Petroleum Corporation,\nMarathon Oil Company, and Exxon Mobil Corporation are liable under the Illinois Consumer\nFraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (“ICFA”), 815 ILCS 505/1, et. seq., for deceptive\nand unfair practices (Counts I and II).  Siegel also brings a common law unjust enrichment claim\nbased on both tort and quasi-contract (Count III) and a common law civil conspiracy claim\n(Count IV).  On September 23, 2008, the Court, in its discretion, denied Siegel’s Amended\nMotion for Class Certification involving Siegel’s proposed nationwide classes.  (R. 308-1,\nMem., Op., & Order.)  Before the Court is Siegel’s Second Amended Motion for Class\nCertification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  For the following reasons, the\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 16 of 35 PageID #:601\nCourt, in its discretion, denies Siegel’s motion.  Further, the Court denies Defendants’ Motion to\nExclude Plaintiff’s Expert Testimony as moot.\nBACKGROUND\nIn his Amended Class Action Complaint, Siegel alleges that “Defendants possess\noligopolistic power and have possessed oligopolistic power throughout the entire class period,\ni.e., 2000 to the date of judgment, in the crude, refined and gasoline industry (“gas industry”),\nand have used this power in concert with their co-conspirators to illegally and artificially restrain\ntrade and increase the price of gasoline to consumers by controlling their inventory, production,\nexports, limiting supply, restricting purchase, zone pricing, falsely advertising the scarceness of\ngasoline and excessive mark up between gasoline and crude prices.”  (R. 77-1, Amend. Compl. ¶\n1.)  In the present motion for class certification, Siegel maintains that Defendants manipulated\nthe nation’s supply of gasoline resulting in Siegel and the proposed class being damaged through\npaying Defendants’ inflated prices for gasoline.  (R. 332-1, Pl.’s Second Amend. Mot. Class\nCert., ¶ 1.)  Siegel further contends that Defendants omitted material information, engaged in\nunfair practices, and that Defendants were unjustly enriched to the detriment of Siegel and the\nproposed class as a result of this conduct.  (Id.)  Siegel seeks certification of the following class: \n“All purchasers who made retail purchases of any Defendants’ branded gasoline in Illinois\nduring the period from and including December 2, 2000, through and including September 5,\n2008.”  (Id. ¶ 2.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD\n“[T]he primary purposes of the class-action mechanism” are “judicial economy and\nefficiency.”  Andrews v. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570, 577 (7th Cir. 2008); see also\n2\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 17 of 35 PageID #:602\nThorogood v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 547 F.3d 742, 744 (7th Cir. 2008) (“The class action is an\ningenious device for economizing on the expense of litigation and enabling small claims to be\nlitigated.”).  To that end, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) states that “[o]ne or more\nmembers of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the\nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law\nor fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of\nthe claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506,\n513 (7th Cir. 2006).  Failure to meet any of these Rule 23(a) requirements precludes class\ncertification.  See Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 797 (7th Cir. 2008).\nIn addition to satisfying the requirements under Rule 23(a), a party seeking class\ncertification must also establish that the proposed class satisfies one of the requirements set forth\nin Rule 23(b).  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138\nL.Ed.2d 689 (1997); Arreola, 546 F.3d at 794.  Here, Siegel requests certification of the\nproposed class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), which applies when “the questions of law or fact\ncommon to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of the controversy.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); see also Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at\n615-16.  Under Rule 23(b)(3), if “a few class members’ injuries prove to be substantial, they may\nopt out and litigate independently.”  Murray v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948, 953 (7th\nCir. 2006).\nThe party seeking class certification has the burden of establishing that certification is\n3\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 3\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 18 of 35 PageID #:603\nproper.  See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.  In determining whether a party has carried that burden, a\ncourt need not accept all of the complaint’s allegations as true.  See Szabo v. Bridgeport Mach.,\nInc., 249 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 2001).  Rather, in deciding whether to certify a class, the Court\n“should make whatever factual and legal inquiries [that] are necessary under Rule 23.”  Id. at\n676; see also General Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d\n740 (1982) (courts may “probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification\nquestion”).  Finally, district courts have broad discretion in determining motions for class\ncertification.  See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 345, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2334, 60 L.Ed.2d\n931 (1979); Payton v. County of Carroll, 473 F.3d 845, 847 (7th Cir. 2007).\nANALYSIS\nThe Court turns to Rule 23(b)(3) because it is dispositive.1  Under Rule 23(b)(3), the\nCourt must determine whether (1) the questions of fact or law common to the class members\npredominate over questions affecting only the individual class members, and (2) a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods of adjudicating plaintiffs’ claims.  See Amchem Prods., 521\nU.S. at 615; Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577.\nI. Predominance \nHere, Defendants maintain that Siegel cannot establish – through common proof – that\nDefendants’ conduct proximately caused harm to each member of the putative class, and thus\n1  In their response brief, Defendants do not challenge the numerosity requirement or that\nthere is a common nucleus of operative facts as required under Rule 23(a), and thus any such\narguments are waived.  See Steen v. Myers, 486 F.3d 1017, 1020 (7th Cir. 2007) (absence of\ndiscussion in briefs amounts to abandonment of claim).  Meanwhile, Defendants’ bare-boned \nadequacy argument is waived.  See White Eagle Coop. Ass’n v. Conner, 553 F.3d 467, 476 n.6\n(7th Cir. 2009) (perfunctory and undeveloped arguments are waived).\n4\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 19 of 35 PageID #:604\nSiegel has failed in his burden of establishing that class treatment is appropriate under Rule\n23(b)(3).  The Court agrees.  When determining if a plaintiff has met the predominance\nrequirement, district courts look beyond the pleadings to determine whether the plaintiff’s claims\nare subject to class-wide proof by common evidence.  See Thorogood, 547 F.3d at 747-48;\nAndrews, 545 F.3d at 577; Pastor v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 487 F.3d 1042, 1046-47\n(7th Cir. 2007); Hewitt v. Joyce Beverages of Wis., Inc., 721 F.2d 625, 628-29 (7th Cir. 1983). \nIn other words, “predominance is concerned with whether the putative named plaintiffs can,\nthrough their individualized cases, offer proof on a class-wide basis.”  Hyderi v. Washington\nMut. Bank, FA, 235 F.R.D. 390, 398 (N.D. Ill. 2006).\nIn Counts I and II of his Amended Class Action Complaint, Siegel brings claims under\nthe Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (“ICFA”), 815 ILCS 505/1,\net. seq., for deceptive and unfair practices.  In the present motion, Siegel characterizes his \ndeceptive practices claim as a “material omissions” claim and his unfair practices claim as an\n“unfair conduct” claim.  Nevertheless, the elements of a claim under the ICFA are:  (1) a\ndeceptive or unfair act or practice by the defendant; (2) the defendant’s intent that the plaintiff\nrely on the deceptive or unfair practice; and (3) the unfair or deceptive practice occurred during a\ncourse of conduct involving trade or commerce.  See Robinson v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp.,\n201 Ill.2d 403, 417, 266 Ill.Dec. 879, 775 N.E.2d 951 (2002); Galvan v. Northwestern Mem’l\nHosp., 382 Ill.App.3d 259, 264, 888 N.E.2d 529, 535, 321 Ill.Dec. 10, 16 (Ill.App. Ct. 2008). \nMoreover, “a private cause of action under ICFA requires a showing of proximate causation.” \nOshana, 472 F.3d at 514-15; Avery v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 216 Ill.2d 100, 200, 835\nN.E.2d 801, 861, 296 Ill.Dec. 448, 508 (2005) (“Proximate causation is an element of all private\n5\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 5\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 20 of 35 PageID #:605\ncauses of action under the Act.”). \nAn Illinois deceptive practices case similar to the present matter involving the advertising\nof gasoline is instructive.  See Oliveira v. Amoco Oil Co., 201 Ill.2d 134, 267 Ill.Dec. 14, 776\nN.E.2d 151 (2002).  In Oliveira, the Supreme Court of Illinois analyzed whether a defendant’s\ngasoline advertisements omitted material facts or were false and misleading under the ICFA and\nconcluded that to establish the proximate cause for deceptive advertising, the plaintiff must show\nthat he was somehow deceived.  See Oliveira, 201 Ill.2d at 139-40, 155; see also Shannon v.\nBoise Cascade Corp., 208 Ill.2d 517, 525, 281 Ill.Dec. 845, 805 N.E.2d 213 (2004) (“deceptive\nadvertising cannot be the proximate cause of damages under the Act unless it actually deceives\nthe plaintiff.”).  As the Seventh Circuit has explained in the context of deceptive practices\nclaims, “a damages claim under the ICFA requires that the plaintiff was deceived in some\nmanner and damaged by the deception.”  Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513-14.    \nLikewise, to establish a common law claim of unjust enrichment – as alleged in Count III\nof Siegel’s Amended Class Action Complaint – a plaintiff must prove deception by the\ndefendant.  See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 515; Bober v. Glaxo Wellcome PLC, 246 F.3d 934, 943 (7th\nCir. 2001) (“in the absence of any deception on the part of the defendants, the requisite violation\nof ‘fundamental principles of justice, equity, and good conscience’ is not present.”) (citation\nomitted); HPI Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 131 Ill.2d 145, 160, 137\nIll.Dec. 19, 545 N.E.2d 672 (1989); see, e.g., In re Sears, Roebuck & Co. Tools Mktg. & Sales\nPractices Litig., No. MDL 1703, 2007 WL 4287511, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 4, 2007).\nHere, Siegel’s own deposition testimony demonstrates that establishing causation for his\nICFA deceptive and unfair practice claims would require the Court to make individual inquiries\n6\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 6\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 21 of 35 PageID #:606\ninto the putative class members’ reactions to Defendants’ alleged unfair and deceptive conduct. \nSpecifically, at his deposition Siegel stated that no one believed in the gas industry’s advertising\nthat explained their profits were not exorbitant and that he, himself, did not personally believe\nthem.  (R. 358-1, Defs.’ Ex. 1, Siegel Dep., at 170-71.)  Siegel further testified that he did not\nbelieve the Defendants’ statements with respect to disparities between the price of gasoline and\nthe price of crude oil.  (Id. at 271.)  Moreover, Siegel admitted that – although he claims that\nDefendants’ advertising of the price at the gas pump failed to inform consumers that the price\nwas not a fair market price – convenience was his number one factor in purchasing gasoline.  (Id.\nat 21, 168.)\nSiegel’s testimony that Defendants’ advertising did not deceive him and that he\npurchased gasoline based on other considerations – such as convenience – not only undermines\nthe typicality requirement under Rule 23(a),2 but also illustrates the difficulty in certifying a\nclass of “millions of individuals throughout Illinois during the relevant time period,”3 who may\nor may not have been deceived by Defendants’ conduct and who may or may not have relied on\nDefendants’ deceptive or unfair practice in purchasing gasoline.  In general, the Court would be\nrequired to make individual determinations concerning the circumstances surrounding each\nindividual’s gasoline purchases to discern whether Defendants conduct proximately caused\nplaintiff’s injuries.  As to Siegel’s deceptive practices and unjust enrichment claims, for\n2  As the Seventh Circuit teaches, “[e]ven though some factual variations may not defeat\ntypicality, the requirement is meant to ensure that the named representative’s claims ‘have the\nsame essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.’” Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472\nF.3d 506, 514 (7th Cir. 2006) (citations and internal quotations omitted).\n3  See R. 333-1, Pl.’s Mem. in Support, at 7.\n7\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 7\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 22 of 35 PageID #:607\nexample, the Court would need to determine whether Defendants deceived each putative class\nmember and whether the individual plaintiff was damaged by the deception.  See In re Sears,\n2007 WL 4287511, at *9 (“it will be necessary to show that each class member purchased the\ntool and paid the price as a result of defendant’s deception.”); see also Barbara’s Sales, Inc. v.\nIntel Corp., 227 Ill.2d 45, 76, 316 Ill.Dec. 522, 879 N.E.2d 910 (2007) (“Under Oliveira and its\nprogeny, plaintiffs must prove that each and every consumer who seeks redress actually saw and\nwas deceived by the statements in question.”).  As the Seventh Circuit instructs, “when a\nseparate evidentiary hearing is required for each class member’s claim, the aggregate expense\nmay, if each claim is very small, swamp the benefits of class-action treatment.”  Pastor, 487 F.3d\nat 1047; see, e.g., Thorogood, 547 F.3d at 746-48.  Such is the case here.  See, e.g., Clark v.\nExperian Info., Inc., 233 F.R.D. 508, 512 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (The nature of the plaintiffs’ [ICFA]\nclaims require an individualize person-by-person evaluation of what the potential class members\nviewed on the defendants’ website, the potential class member’s understanding of and reliance\non this information, and what damages, if any, resulted.”).  In sum, unlike class actions where a\ndefendant’s conduct is standardized and the class plaintiffs’ individual reactions to the\ndefendant’s conduct are unnecessary in determining liability, see Murray v. GMAC Mortgage,\nCorp., 434 F.3d 948, 955 (7th Cir. 2006), Siegel’s proposed class requires the Court to determine\nhow each plaintiff reacted to Defendants’ alleged unfair and deceptive conduct.  \nAccordingly, Siegel has failed in his burden of establishing that common evidence can be\nused to prove that each class member relied on Defendants’ unfair or deceptive conduct when\npurchasing gasoline at an allegedly elevated price.  Because individual fact issues predominate\nover common fact issues, the Court denies Siegel’s motion for class certification as to his ICFA\n8\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 8\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 23 of 35 PageID #:608\nclaims as alleged in Counts I and II of the Amended Class Action Complaint, as well as Siegel’s\nunjust enrichment claim in Count III.  See Thorogood, 547 F.3d at 747-48.\nIn Count IV of his Amended Class Action Complaint, Siegel alleges a common law civil \nconspiracy claim.  As the Court previously explained when denying Defendants’ Rule 12(c)\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, a civil conspiracy claim is not a stand-alone tort.  (R. 228-\n1, 1/2/08 Minute Order, at 5.)  Instead, the “function of a conspiracy claim is to extend tort\nliability from the active wrongdoer to wrongdoers who may have only planned, assisted or\nencouraged the active wrongdoer.”  Redelmann v. Claire Sprayway, Inc., 375 Ill.App.3d 912,\n923, 314 Ill.Dec. 320, 874 N.E.2d 230 (2007).  Put differently, “civil conspiracy is not an\nindependent tort but must be premised on the commission of an underlying independent wrong.” \nDe Bouse v. Bayer AG, 385 Ill.App.3d 812, 829, 324 Ill.Dec. 806, 896 N.E.2d 882 (2008).  In\nfact, in his original class action brief, Siegel admitted that a common law civil conspiracy claim\nrequires an underlying tort.  (R. 291-1, Pl.’s Class Cert. Mem., at 32.)  Because Siegel has failed\nto establish the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement for the underlying tort and quasi-\ncontract claims, Siegel cannot establish predominance for his civil conspiracy claim. \nII. Superiority\nFinally, the Court turns to whether a class action is superior to other methods for the\nadjudication of the proposed class’ claims.  See Szabo, 249 F.3d at 676.  In short, the difficulties\nin managing the plaintiff-specific issues in the proposed class work against Siegel establishing\nthe superiority requirement under Rule 23(b)(3).  See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S.\n156, 164, 94 S.Ct. 2140 (1974) (manageability considerations encompass “range of practical\nproblems that may render the class action format inappropriate for a particular suit.”); see also\n9\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 9\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 75 Filed: 05/10/10 Page 24 of 35 PageID #:609\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(D).  As the Seventh Circuit explains, although “the need for individual\ndamages determinations does not, in and of itself, require denial of his motion for certification,”\nsee Arreola, 546 F.3d at 801, “if the class certification only serves to give rise to hundreds or\nthousands of individual proceedings requiring individually tailored remedies, it is hard to see\nhow common issues predominate or how a class action would be the superior means to\nadjudicate the claims.”  Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577.  Accordingly, Siegel has failed in his burden\nof establishing the superiority requirement under Rule 23(b)(3).\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the Court denies Plaintiff’s Second Amended Motion For Class\nCertification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and denies Defendants’ Motion to\nExclude Plaintiff’s Expert as moot.\nDated: February 23, 2009 \nENTERED\n_____________________________\nAMY J.

EVE, District Court Judge: \nIn their Second Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiffs Catherine Zaborowski and\nSimone Jackson, individually, and on behalf of a class (“Class Plaintiffs”), allege violations of\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights and state law against Thomas J.\nDart, the Sheriff of Cook County, in his official capacity, in relation to the alleged policy of\nshackling pregnant detainees1 during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery.  The\nIndividual Plaintiffs allege an individual capacity claim against Sheriff Dart based on his delay\n1  The parties use the terms “detainee” and “inmate” interchangeably, although it is\nundisputed that Plaintiffs were pretrial detainees and not convicted prisoners.  (See R. 257,\n8/11/11, Reply Brief, at 2 n.1.)  \n\nin instituting any remedial action after he learned about the shackling policy.  \nBefore the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment on the Class\nPlaintiffs’ official capacity and state law claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. \nAlso before the Court is Sheriff Dart’s motion for summary judgment as to the Individual\nPlaintiffs’ individual capacity claim, also brought pursuant to Rule 56.  Because there are\ngenuine disputes as to the material facts underlying the Class Plaintiffs’ substantive due process\nand state law claims, the Court denies the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.  The\nCourt, however, grants Sheriff Dart’s motion for summary judgment in regard to the individual\ncapacity claim and dismisses Sheriff Dart in his individual capacity from this lawsuit.  \nBACKGROUND\nI. Northern District of Illinois Local Rule 56.1\nNorthern District of Illinois Local Rule 56.1 assists the Court by “organizing the\nevidence, identifying undisputed facts, and demonstrating precisely how each side propose[s] to\nprove a disputed fact with admissible evidence.”  Bordelon v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs.,\n233 F.3d 524, 527 (7th Cir. 2000).  “The Rule is designed, in part, to aid the district court,\n‘which does not have the advantage of the parties’ familiarity with the record and often cannot\nafford to spend the time combing the record to locate the relevant information,’ in determining\nwhether a trial is necessary.”  Delapaz v. Richardson, 634 F.3d 895, 899 (7th Cir. 2011) (citation\nomitted).  Specifically, Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) requires the moving party to provide “a statement\nof material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue.”  Cracco v.\nVitran Exp., Inc., 559 F.3d 625, 632 (7th Cir. 2009).  “The opposing party is required to file ‘a\nresponse to each numbered paragraph in the moving party’s statement, including, in the case of\n2\n\nany disagreement, specific references to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other supporting\nmaterials relied upon.”  Id. (citing N.D. Ill. R. 56.1(b)(3)(B)).  Also, Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C)\nrequires the nonmoving party to present a separate statement of additional facts that requires the\ndenial of summary judgment.  See Ciomber v. Cooperative Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 635, 643-44 (7th\nCir. 2008). \nThe purpose of Local Rule 56.1 statements is to identify the relevant admissible evidence\nsupporting the material facts, not to make factual or legal arguments.  See Cady v. Sheahan, 467\nF.3d 1057, 1060 (7th Cir. 2006) (“statement of material facts did [] not comply with Rule 56.1 as\nit failed to adequately cite the record and was filled with irrelevant information, legal arguments,\nand conjecture”).  The Court may disregard statements and responses that do not properly cite to\nthe record.  See Cichon v. Exelon Generation Co., L.L.C., 401 F.3d 803, 809-10 (7th Cir. 2005). \nMoreover, the requirements for responses under Local Rule 56.1 are “not satisfied by evasive\ndenials that do not fairly meet the substance of the material facts asserted.”  Bordelon, 233 F.3d\nat 528.  “District courts have broad discretion to enforce and require strict compliance with their\nlocal rules.”  Benuzzi v. Board of Educ. of City of Chicago, 647 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir. 2011). \nMany of the parties’ Local Rule 56.1 statements and responses are argumentative,\nevasive, and do not properly cite to the record.  When culling the relevant facts of this case, the\nCourt considered each statement and response individually to determine whether they were\nproper under the local rules.  \nII. Relevant Facts\nThis case is partially proceeding as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(b)(3) for:  “All women in the custody of defendant Sheriff on and after December\n3\n\n4, 2006, who have been or who will be shackled during labor, delivery, or recovery following\ndelivery.”  (R. 217, Pls.’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. Facts ¶ 1.)  The Individual Plaintiffs, who are bringing\nan individual capacity claim against Sheriff Thomas J. Dart, include Nicole Blair, Lisa Brown,\nDanielle Bryant, Isabel Carmona, Marianne Cruz, Cora Fletcher, Denae Johnson, Deborah Lee,\nFelicia Ligon, Angela Oss, Sheena Richardson, Bennetta Sidney, Monique Starnes, and Latania\nWalton.  (R. 221, Defs.’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. Facts ¶ 3.)  Defendants are the Sheriff of Cook County\nand Cook County, Illinois.2  (Pls.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 2.) \nIn 1999, the Sheriff’s Office created the Department of Women’s Justice Services\n(“DWJS”) that specifically focuses on women offenders.  (R. 214, Dart Rule 56.1 Stmt. Facts ¶\n34.)  The DWJS’s mission is to create integrated programs and services that break the inter-\ngenerational cycle of trauma, addiction, and crime for women and their children.  (Id.)  These\ngoals are achieved through various programs, including the Maternal Objective Management\n(“MOMs”) program.  (Id.)  The MOMs program is a residential program that is currently located\noutside of the Cook County Jail (“CCJ”) Complex at the Haymarket Center and provides\npregnant and postpartum detainees treatment for mental health, physical health, and substance\nabuse, as well as other supportive services.  (Pls.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 5; Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 55; Defs.’\nStmt. Facts ¶ 24.)   \nFrom December 2006 until October 14, 2008, if a pregnant detainee assigned to the\n2  Although Cook County cannot be held vicariously liable for Sheriff Dart’s alleged\nmisconduct in relation to the Individual Plaintiffs’ individual capacity claim, because Illinois\ncounties have the duty to indemnify judgments against county sheriffs in their official capacity,\nCook County is a necessary party to this lawsuit.  See Askew v. Sheriff of Cook County, 568 F.3d\n632, 636-37 (7th Cir. 2009); Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle County, 324 F.3d 947, 948 (7th Cir.\n2003); see also Moy v. County of Cook, 159 Ill.2d 519, 528-32, 203 Ill.Dec. 776, 640 N.E.2d 926\n(Ill. 1994). \n4\n\nMOMs program was in labor, a Haymarket staff member would transport her to an outlying\nhospital, which in most cases was the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County.  (Defs.’\nStmt. Facts ¶ 16; Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 58.)  Also during this time period, correctional officers did\nnot restrain detainees in the MOMs program while they were at the MOMs facility or in\ntransport to or from a medical facility.  (Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 59; R. 242, Pls.’ Stmt. Add’l Facts ¶\n1.)  Up until October 14, 2008, once a MOMs participant was admitted to a hospital, she was\nturned over to External Operations staff to be guarded in accordance with the External\nOperations policy in effect.  (Defs.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 29; Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 60.)  Effective October\n14, 2008, correctional officers did not restrain detainees in the MOMs program in any way\nduring the course of their pregnancy, including transportation to the hospital, labor, delivery, or\npost-delivery recovery.  (Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 64; Pls.’ Stmt. Add’l Facts ¶ 3.)  \nPregnant detainees at the CCJ Complex who were eligible for placement in the MOMs\nprogram often remained at the CCJ Complex if the MOMs program was full.  (Pl.’s Stmt. Facts ¶\n6.)  There is evidence in the record that until April 2010, correctional officers shackled pregnant\ndetainees housed at the CCJ Complex while transporting them to the hospital and at the hospital\nwhile they were in labor.  (Id. ¶¶ 11, 23(b).)  A correctional officer would accompany a pregnant\ndetainee housed at the CCJ Complex in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and one or two\nother correctional officers would follow in a squad car.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  \nThe Sheriff of Cook County’s Policy Number EO-32, External Operations, Hospital\nPolicy and Procedure, effective July 25, 2006, concerning the procedures for transporting\ndetainees housed outside of the CCJ Complex, states:\n(a) “In accordance with Illinois Statute 730 ILCS 125/17.5 (Pregnant Female\nPrisoners) NO handcuffs, leg irons or waist chains shall be used on a female\n5\n\ninmate (detainee) who is in labor, this includes while being transported to a\nmedical facility.”\n(b) “A female External Operations Officer is to be assigned to the pregnant\ninmate (detainee) whenever possible.”\n(c) “The External Operations Officer is to remain no further than outside the\ndelivery room door once the pregnant inmate (detainee) enters the room.”\n(d) “The External Operations Officer will follow all hospital policies that do not\nconflict with maintaining the security of and preventing the escape of the inmate\n(detainee).”\n(Defs.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 51.)  (emphasis added).  The 2008 General Order is substantially the same\nas the 2006 General Order regarding pregnant detainees in labor.  (Id. ¶ 53.)  Neither the 2006 or\n2008 General Orders define “labor,” although the 2010 General Order defines “pregnant subject\nin labor” as “any individual in the custody of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office who claims to be\nin labor or giving birth, appears to be in labor, or who is verified by medical personnel to be in\nlabor.”  (Id. ¶¶ 51, 53, 60.)  The relevant 2010 General Order also barred the use of leg shackles\non pregnant detainees regardless of the stage of their pregnancy, including up to two weeks after\ndelivery.  (Id. ¶ 59.)  In February 2011, the Sheriff’s Office also adopted a General Order\nprohibiting the shackling of “postpartum subjects.”  (Pls.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 27.)\nAt all times relevant to this lawsuit, and pursuant to Chapter 730, Corrections,\nspecifically 730 ILCS 125/17.5,3 the law in Illinois regarding the use of restraints on pregnant\ndetainees stated:\nNotwithstanding any other statute, directive, or administrative regulation, when a\npregnant female prisoner is brought to a hospital from a county jail for the\npurpose of delivering her baby, no handcuffs, shackles, or restraints of any kind\n3  Chapter 55, Counties, of the Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated, states this same\nlanguage.  See 55 ILCS 5/3-15003.6.  \n6\n\nmay be used during her transport to a medical facility for the purpose of\ndelivering her baby.  Under no circumstances may leg irons or shackles or waist\nshackles be used on any pregnant female prisoner who is in labor.  Upon the\npregnant female prisoner’s entry to the hospital delivery room, a county\ncorrectional officer must be posted immediately outside the delivery room.  The\nSheriff must provide for adequate personnel to monitor the pregnant female\nprisoner during her transport to and from the hospital and during her stay at the\nhospital.\n(Defs.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 55; Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 41.) (emphasis added).\nDespite the 2006 and 2008 General Orders and the Illinois statute, there is evidence in the\nrecord that correctional officers shackled pregnant detainees Plaintiff Simone Jackson, who was\na MOMs participant, and Plaintiff Sheena Richardson, who was housed at the CCJ Complex, at\nsome point during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery in May 2008 and\nSeptember 2008, respectively.  (Pls.’ Stmt. Facts ¶¶ 14(c), 15, 17(a), (b), (c), 18, 20, 25(a), (b),\n26, 28(b).)  Also, the Superintendent of External Operations testified that until October 2008,\ncorrectional officers shackled all detainees – whether they were from the MOMs program or the\nCCJ Complex – at the hospital until the doctor informed the guards that the detainee was in\n“active labor.”  (Id. ¶ 22; Ex. 10, Holmes Dep., at 96-97.)  Further, the Executive Director of the\nWomen’s Justice Services testified that in 2006 correctional officers used leg irons to secure\npregnant detainees to the bed frame while they were in the hospital to deliver their children.  (Id.\n¶ 15; Ex. 9, McDermott Dep., at 19-20.)  The Superintendent of Administration also testified that\nafter 2008, correctional officers continued to shackle pregnant detainees who came from the CCJ\nComplex while they were in the hospital to deliver their children.  (Id. ¶ 23(b); Ex. 12, Hickerson\nDep, at 43.)  Meanwhile, if there was no emergency or life threatening situation, the correctional\nofficer monitoring the detainee at the hospital was required to obtain a supervisor’s approval\nbefore removing any such restraints.  (Id. ¶¶ 19, 26.) \n7\n\nBoth the 2006 and 2008 General Orders designated all detainees “who are transported,\nhoused or otherwise located outside of the CCDOC [Cook County Department of Corrections]\ncomplex” as “high risk.”  (Defs.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 49; Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 51.)  Detainees who are\ntransported or housed at outside medical facilities are considered “high risk” because they are no\nlonger within the secured confines of the Cook County Jail, a lone correctional officer often\nguards the detainees, they have exposure to the public and medical personnel, and they have\neasier access to potential weapons.  (Dart Stmt. Facts ¶ 51.)  Moreover, numerous detainees have\nattempted to escape while being transported to or from a hospital or while at a hospital, including\npregnant or postpartum detainees from the CCJ Complex and MOMs program.  (Id. ¶ 52; Defs.’\nStmt. Facts ¶¶ 78-99.)  Defendants, however, admit that women in the MOMs program are not\nlikely to be a flight risk and that detainees assigned to the MOMs program wear electronic\nmonitoring devices.  (Pls.’ Stmt. Facts ¶¶ 5(d), 7.)  \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.R.Civ.P.\n56(a).  A genuine dispute as to any material fact exists if “the evidence is such that a reasonable\njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).  In determining summary judgment\nmotions, “facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there\nis a ‘genuine’ dispute as to those facts.”  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167\nL.Ed.2d 686 (2007).  The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of establishing that\nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n8\n\n323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  After “a properly supported motion for summary\njudgment is made, the adverse party ‘must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine\nissue for trial.’”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 (quotation omitted).\nANALYSIS\nI. Substantive Due Process Claim\nIn their Second Amended Complaint, the Class Plaintiffs allege a substantive due process\nclaim under the Fourteenth Amendment.  More specifically, the Class Plaintiffs maintain that the\nSheriff’s shackling policy violates their due process right to their liberty interest in bodily\nintegrity because the use of restraints under the circumstances constitutes punishment.4  See Hart\nv. Sheahan, 396 F.3d 887, 891 (7th Cir. 2005); May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir.\n2000); see also Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 316, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). \nBefore the Court addresses Defendants’ argument that any such restraint policy was rationally\nrelated to the CCJ’s legitimate penological interests in safety and security, the Court turns to the\nofficial shackling policy at issue.\nAlthough the 2006 and 2008 General Orders for External Operations – Hospital Policy\nand Procedure – which applied to pregnant detainees housed outside of the CCJ Complex, stated\nthat “NO handcuffs, leg irons or waist chains shall be used on a female inmate (detainee) who is\n4  In their opening brief, the Class Plaintiffs contend that the Sheriff’s policy amounts to a\ndeliberate indifference to a serious medical need.  See Minix v. Canarecci, 597 F.3d 824, 830-31\n(7th Cir. 2010).  Plaintiffs, however, fail to properly develop this argument.  See Clarett v.\nRoberts, 657 F.3d 664, 674 (7th Cir. 2011) (“undeveloped arguments are considered waived”). \nIndeed, since the beginning of this lawsuit, Plaintiffs have repeatedly characterized the Sheriff’s\npolicy as violative of their liberty interest in bodily integrity.  (See, e.g., R. 23, 6/15/09 Motion\nfor Class Cert.; R. 173, 2/17/11 Rule 37 Motion to Bar.)  Therefore, the Court addresses the\nClass Plaintiffs’ claim as a Fourteenth Amendment freedom from bodily restraint claim.  See\nMay v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir. 2000).\n9\n\nin labor,” there is evidence in the record that correctional officers shackled pregnant detainees\nfrom the MOMs program at some point during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following\ndelivery.  Also, despite the Illinois statute forbidding the shackling of pregnant detainees in labor\nwho are detained at a county jail, there is also evidence in the record that correctional officers\nshackled pregnant detainees assigned to the CCJ Complex while they were being transported to\nthe hospital and also during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery.  Indeed, the\nSheriff’s Office admits that it shackled pregnant detainees when they were being transported to\nthe hospital and were in pre-labor or post-delivery.  (See R. 223, Defs.’ 6/15/11 Brief, at 8.)  The\nSheriff’s Office, however, maintains that correctional officers did not shackle pregnant detainees\nduring “active labor,” although the 2006 and 2008 General Orders and the Illinois statute do not\ndistinguish between “labor” and “active labor.” \nAccordingly, although the Sheriff’s official policy and Illinois statute forbid the use of\nhandcuffs, leg irons, or waist chains on pregnant detainees who are in labor, the Class Plaintiffs\nmaintain that the Sheriff’s Office had a widespread, unwritten practice of shackling pregnant\ndetainees in labor.5  As such, Plaintiffs’ argument must be viewed under the framework set forth\nin Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611\n(1978), because their official capacity claim against Sheriff Dart is a claim against the Sheriff’s\nOffice itself, and they are arguing that there is a widespread custom or practice of shackling\npregnant detainees during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery.  See Walker v.\nSheahan, 526 F.3d 973, 977 (7th Cir. 2008) (“Actions against individual defendants in their\nofficial capacities are treated as suits brought against the government entity itself”); see also\n5  See R. 131, Second Amend. Compl. ¶ 11.\n10\n\nThomas v. Cook County Sheriff’s Dept., 604 F.3d 293, 306 (7th Cir. 2010) (“Monell recognized\nthat the premise behind a § 1983 action against a government body is ‘the allegation that official\npolicy is responsible for the deprivation of rights.’”) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). \nThree types of policies or customs are recognized in this context:\n(1) an express policy that, when enforced, causes a constitutional deprivation; (2)\na widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express\nmunicipal policy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or\nusage with the force of law; or (3) an allegation that the constitutional injury was\ncaused by a person with final policy-making authority.\nKlebanowski v. Sheahan, 540 F.3d 633, 637 (7th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted); see also Guzman\nv. Sheahan, 495 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2007).  \nBased on Plaintiffs’ arguments, the Court turns to whether there is evidence in the record\nof “a widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express municipal\npolicy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.” \nKlebanowski, 540 F.3d at 637.  To demonstrate that the Sheriff’s Office is liable for a harmful\ncustom or practice, the Class Plaintiffs must establish that policymakers for the Sheriff’s Office\nwere deliberately indifferent as to the known or obvious consequences of the unwritten shackling\npolicy.  See Thomas, 604 F.3d at 303; Montano v. City of Chicago, 535 F.3d 558, 570 (7th Cir.\n2008).  “In other words, [the policymakers] must have been aware of the risk created by the\ncustom or practice and must have failed to take appropriate steps to protect the plaintiff.” \nThomas, 604 F.3d at 303; see also Montano, 535 F.3d at 570. \nPlaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence raising a genuine dispute as to the material\nfact that the Sheriff’s Office had a widespread practice of shackling pregnant detainees during\nlabor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery and that policymakers were aware of the\n11\n\ncustom or practice and did not take appropriate steps to protect the Class Plaintiffs.  See Phelan\nv. Cook County, 463 F.3d 773, 789 (7th Cir. 2006) (“If the same problem has arisen many times\nand the municipality has acquiesced in the outcome, it is possible (though not necessary) to infer\nthat there is a policy at work.”); Jackson v. Marion County, 66 F.3d 151, 152 (7th Cir. 1995) (the\n“usual way in which an unconstitutional policy is inferred, in the absence of direct evidence, is\nby showing a series of bad acts and inviting the court to infer from them that the policymaking\nlevel of government was bound to have noticed what was going on and by failing to do anything\nmust have encouraged or at least condoned, thus in either event adopting, the misconduct of\nsubordinate officers.”).  More specifically, not only is there direct evidence in the record that\ncorrectional officers shackled pregnant detainees Plaintiffs Simone Jackson and Sheena\nRichardson at some time during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery, CCJ\npolicymakers testified about the shackling policy.  See Waters v. City of Chicago, 580 F.3d 575,\n582 (7th Cir. 2009) (a policymaker sets or adopts rules of conduct not merely implements pre-\nexisting rules).  Specifically, the policymakers testified as follows: (1) the Superintendent of\nExternal Operations stated that until October 2008, correctional officers shackled pregnant\ndetainees – whether they were from the MOMs program or the CCJ Complex – at the hospital\nuntil the doctor informed the guards that the detainee was in “active labor;” (2) the Executive\nDirector of the Women’s Justice Services testified that in 2006 correctional officers used leg\nirons to secure pregnant detainees to the bed frame while they were in the hospital to deliver\ntheir children; and (3) the Superintendent of Administration testified that after 2008, correctional\nofficers continued to shackle pregnant women who came from the CCJ Complex while they were\nin the hospital to deliver their children.  As such, there is a genuine dispute as to the material fact\n12\n\nthat policymakers knew of the shackling policy and did not take steps to protect the Class\nPlaintiffs.  On the other hand, construing the facts and all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nSheriff’s Office, the Class Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence establishing that\nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).  \nThe Court now turns to the Sheriff’s argument that this restraint policy was rationally\nrelated to the CCJ’s legitimate penological interest in safety and security.  In general, conditions\nof confinement that are reasonably related to a legitimate and non-punitive governmental\nobjective are not unconstitutional.  See Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d 469, 477 (7th Cir. 2005);\nMurphy v. Walker, 51 F.3d 714, 718 (7th Cir. 1995).6  The Seventh Circuit explains that in “Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court said that the\nproper question to guide determination of the constitutionality of restrictive conditions in pretrial\ndetention was ‘whether those conditions amount to punishment of the detainee.’”  Hart, 396 F.3d\nat 891 (quoting Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535).  “The use of bodily restraints constitutes punishment\nin the constitutional sense if their use is not rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive\ngovernment purpose or they appear excessive in relation to the purpose they allegedly serve.” \n6   The Sheriff’s Office argues that Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96\nL.Ed.2d 64 (1987), and its progeny are the controlling legal authority.  Turner and its progeny,\nhowever, concern prison regulations most often in the context of convicted prisoners’ First\nAmendment rights.  See, e.g., Van den Bosch v. Raemisch 658 F.3d 778, 785 (7th Cir. 2011);\nVinning-El v. Evans, 657 F.3d 591, 592-93 (7th Cir. 2011).  As far as restrictive conditions of\nconfinement as applied to pretrial detainees under the Fourteenth Amendment are concerned, the\nSeventh Circuit has relied upon Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979), applying this standard in the context of shackling policies similar to the one at issue\nin this lawsuit.  See May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir. 2000); Murphy v. Walker, 51\nF.3d 714, 717-18 (7th Cir. 1995).  The Court therefore follows the Supreme Court’s decision in\nWolfish and the Seventh Circuit’s decisions in May and Murphy.\n13\n\nMay, 226 F.3d at 884.  As the Hart decision clarifies, pretrial detainees, as well as convicted\nprisoners, have “an interest in being free from gratuitously severe restraints and hazards, while\nthe detention facility has an interest in protecting the safety of detainees and guards and\npreventing escapes.”  Id. at 893.\nEvidence in the record reveals that the External Operations Division has approximately\n345 correctional officers who are responsible for the transfer of 3,000 to 4,000 detainees to\nmedical facilities located outside of the CCJ Complex each year.  (Defs.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 14.) \nThese medical facilities include at least three county hospitals and numerous medical clinics. \n(Id. ¶ 15.)  Also, the vast majority of the pregnant detainees from either the CCJ Complex or the\nMOMs program deliver their children at Stroger Hospital, which is a 1.2 million square foot\nmedical facility at which 300,000 patients are treated annually.  (Id. ¶¶ 16, 17.)  There is also\nundisputed evidence in the record that detainees have attempted to escape while being\ntransported to or from the hospital or while at the hospital, including pregnant detainees.  The\nSheriff’s Office admits, however, that women in the MOMs program are not likely to be a flight\nrisk and that detainees assigned to the MOMs program wear electronic monitoring devices,\nalthough the Sheriff’s Office does not admit that pregnant detainees transported from the CCJ\nComplex are not a flight risk.  Finally, there is evidence in the record that at least one\ncorrectional officer would accompany pregnant detainees housed at the CCJ Complex while in\ntransit to the hospital and that correctional officers guard all detainees at the outside medical\nfacilities.  \nConstruing these facts and all reasonable inferences in the Class Plaintiffs’ favor, there is\nsufficient evidence in the record raising a genuine dispute as to the material fact that the\n14\n\nshackling policy was rationally related to the non-punitive purpose of protecting the safety of\nhospital staff and correctional officers, as well as preventing escapes – based on the amount of\ndetainees the Sheriff’s Office guards in transit and at the outlying medical facilities, as well as\nthe previous escape attempts.  See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 546 (“maintaining institutional security\nand preserving internal order and discipline” are central goals of prison administration).  In\nshort, the Sheriff’s Office has presented sufficient evidence raising a genuine issue of fact that\nthe shackling policy was not arbitrary, purposeless, or gratuitous, but was related to a non-\npunitive, administrative purpose.  See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 539; Hart, 396 F.3d at 892; Antonelli\nv. Sheahan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1427 (7th Cir. 1996).  The Sheriff’s Office, however, has not\npresented sufficient evidence to establish that there is no genuine dispute as to any material facts\nunder the circumstances and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law – especially\nbecause the parties hotly dispute the extent to which the shackling policy was enforced in the\nfirst instance.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).  Because genuine disputes of material facts exist in\nrelation to the Class Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim, the Court denies the parties’ cross-\nmotions for summary judgment as to this claim.  \nII. State Law Negligence Claim\n  In the Second Amended Complaint, the Class Plaintiffs also allege that the shackling\npolicy is “in willful and wanton disregard of the laws of the State of Illinois.”  (R. 131, Second.\nAm. Compl. ¶ 8.)  The Class Plaintiffs’ state law claim sounds in negligence based on the\nSheriff’s alleged violation of the Illinois statute that forbids shackling pregnant prisoners in\nlabor.  See Calloway v. Kinkelaar, 168 Ill.2d 312, 319-20, 213 Ill.Dec. 675, 659 N.E.2d 1322\n(Ill. 1995).  As the Supreme Court of Illinois has recognized, “tort liability may arise, on public\n15\n\npolicy grounds, for tortious conduct that would defeat the aims and goals of a particular statutory\nscheme” if the statute “was designed to protect human life or property.”  Id. at 319; see also\nCamp v. TNT Logistics Corp., 553 F.3d 502, 506 (7th Cir. 2009) (“a violation of a statute or\nordinance designed to protect human life or property is prima facie evidence of negligence; the\nviolation does not constitute negligence per se.”).  To clarify, if “the plaintiff is a member of the\nprotected class and his or her injury is of the type that the statute was intended to protect against,\nthe plaintiff may recover upon establishing that the defendant’s violation of the ordinance or\nstatute proximately caused plaintiff’s injury.”  Calloway, 168 Ill.2d at 319.  Accordingly, to\n“recover damages based upon a defendant’s alleged statutory violation, a plaintiff must show\nthat (1) she belongs to the class of persons that the statute was designed to protect; (2) her injury\nis of the type that the statute was designed to prevent; and (3) the violation proximately caused\nher injury.”  First Springfield Bank & Trust v. Galman, 188 Ill.2d 252, 256, 242 Ill.Dec. 113,\n720 N.E.2d 1068 (Ill. 1999); see also Camp, 553 F.3d at 506.\nInstead of addressing the Class Plaintiffs’ state law negligence claim under this\nframework, the Sheriff’s Office argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish a state-created liberty\ninterest under Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).  See\nThielman v. Leean, 282 F.3d 478, 480 (7th Cir. 2002) (“Liberty interests can arise from two\nsources: the Federal Constitution or state law.”).  As discussed above, Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process claim is based on their liberty interest in bodily integrity,\nsee Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997),\nwhile their state law claim is a negligence claim based on the Sheriff’s alleged violation of the\nIllinois statute forbidding the shackling of pregnant prisoners during labor.  See Calloway, 168\n16\n\nIll.2d at 319-20.  Therefore, the Sheriff’s arguments based on Sandin are misplaced.\nThe Sheriff’s Office also contends that the Class Plaintiffs’ state law negligence claim is\nbarred by the one-year limitations period set forth in section 8-101(a) of the Illinois Local\nGovernment and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act.  See 745 ILCS 10/8-101(a).  The\nSheriff’s Office, however, failed to raise this affirmative defense in the Answer to the Second\nAmended Complaint and brings this argument for the first time in the present summary judgment\nmotions.  The Sheriff’s failure to plead this affirmative defense in the Answer – and the fact that\nthe Sheriff’s Office did not bring this defense until the summary judgment stage of these\nproceedings – amounts to waiver of the statute of limitations defense, especially because the\nSheriff’s Office offers no cogent justification for the delay.  See Walker, 526 F.3d at 979.  The\nCourt thus turns to the Class Plaintiffs’ negligence claim.\nHere, the Class Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence creating a genuine dispute as\nto the material fact that they belong to the class of persons that the anti-shackling statute was\ndesigned to protect, namely, pregnant detainees in labor.  Indeed, as Representative William\nBlack stated at the Illinois General Assembly, House of Representatives debate on March 10,\n1999: “[I]t’s kind of ludicrous, as you say, to think that the woman in labor is going to jump off\nthe bed and run out of the hospital.”  (Pls.’ Stmt. Facts ¶ 35.)  Moreover, the Class Plaintiffs’\ninjuries associated with their shackling are the type of injuries the Illinois statute is designed to\nprevent, including the strain on the unborn child and the mother.  (Id., Ex. 1, 3/10/99 Illinois\nGeneral Assembly debate, at 2-3.)  Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable juror could\ninfer that the Sheriff’s alleged violation of the statute proximately caused the Class Plaintiffs’\ninjuries.  See Rivera v. Garcia, 401 Ill.App.3d 602, 613, 340 Ill.Dec. 224, 927 N.E.2d 1235 (1st\n17\n\nDist. 2010) (“The injury must be the natural and probable result of the negligent act or\nomission”) (citation omitted).\nBecause the Sheriff’s Office is a local public entity, however, there is an extra layer of\nanalysis required under the Illinois Local Government and Governmental Employees Tort\nImmunity Act.  See 745 ILCS 10/1-101, et seq.  Specifically, in “order to protect public funds\nfrom being dissipated by damage awards in tort cases, the Local Government and Governmental\nEmployees Tort Immunity Act was enacted to shield local public entities and public employees\nfrom liability for ordinary negligence committed during the exercise of their duties.”  Mitchell v.\nSpecial Educ. Joint Agreement Sch. Dist. No. 208, 386 Ill.App.3d 106, 111, 325 Ill.Dec. 104, 897\nN.E.2d 352 (1st Dist. 2008) (internal citation omitted).  Section 2-202 of the Tort Immunity Act\nstates that a “public employee is not liable for his act or omission in the execution or\nenforcement of any law unless such act or omission constitutes willful and wanton conduct.” \nSee 745 ILCS 10/2-202.  The Tort Immunity Act defines willful and wanton conduct as:\n[A] course of action which shows an actual or deliberate intention to cause harm\nor which, if not intentional, shows an utter indifference to or conscious disregard\nfor the safety of others or their property.  This definition shall apply in any case\nwhere a “willful and wanton” exception is incorporated into any immunity under\nthis Act.\n745 ILCS 10/1–210; see also Tagliere v. Western Springs Park Dist., 408 Ill.App.3d 235, 241-\n42, 348 Ill.Dec. 643, 944 N.E.2d 884 (1st Dist. 2011).\nAs discussed above, certain policymakers at the Sheriff’s Office, namely, the\nSuperintendent of External Operations, the Executive Director of the Women’s Justice Services,\nand the Superintendent of Administration, acknowledged that pregnant detainees from both the\nMOMs program and the CCJ Complex were shackled at some point during labor, delivery,\n18\n\nand/or recovery following delivery.  Although these individuals were aware of the shackling of\npregnant detainees in labor, there is no evidence in the record that they took any action to change\nthe practice or to comply with the Illinois statute that became effective on January 1, 2000. \nBased on this evidence, a reasonable juror could infer that these policymakers consciously\ndisregarded the pregnant detainees’ and their infants’ health when delivering.  (See Pls.’ Stmt.\nFacts ¶¶ 32, 33.)  Therefore, there are genuine disputes of material fact in regard to the Class\nPlaintiffs’ negligence claim based on the Illinois statute forbidding the shackling of pregnant\nprisoners in labor.  The Court thus denies the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment as to\nthe Class Plaintiffs’ state law negligence claim.  \nIII. Individual Capacity Claim \nLast, the Individual Plaintiffs assert that Sheriff Dart, in his individual capacity, had\nactual knowledge of the practice of shackling pregnant detainees during labor, delivery, and/or\nrecovery following delivery and that Sheriff Dart took more than one year in taking remedial\naction after he learned of the shackling policy. \nIn his summary judgment motion, Sheriff Dart contends that the Individual Plaintiffs\nhave failed to present sufficient evidence establishing a genuine dispute as to his personal\ninvolvement in the practice of shackling pregnant detainees in labor.  “[I]ndividual liability\nunder § 1983 requires ‘personal involvement in the alleged constitutional deprivation.’”  Minix v.\nCanarecci, 597 F.3d 824, 833–34 (7th Cir. 2010) (quoting Palmer v. Marion County, 327 F.3d\n588, 594 (7th Cir. 2003)); see also Brooks v. Ross, 578 F.3d 574, 580 (7th Cir. 2009).  It is well\nsettled that “Section 1983 creates a cause of action based on personal liability and predicated\nupon fault; thus, liability does not attach unless the individual defendant caused or participated in\n19\n\na constitutional deprivation.”  Vance v. Peters, 97 F.3d 987, 991 (7th Cir. 1996); see also\nGrieveson v. Anderson, 538 F.3d 763, 776 (7th Cir. 2008) (“A plaintiff bringing a civil rights\naction must prove that the defendant personally participated in or caused the unconstitutional\nactions.”) (citations omitted).  Moreover, “[g]overnment officials may not be held liable for the\nunconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior.”  Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1948, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).  Instead, a government\nofficial satisfies the personal responsibility requirement if the conduct causing the alleged\nconstitutional deprivation occurs at the official’s direction or with his knowledge and consent. \nSee Arnett v. Webster, 658 F.3d 742, 757 (7th Cir. 2011).\nWhile there is undisputed evidence in the record that Sheriff Dart was aware of the 2006\nand 2008 General Orders that stated: “NO handcuffs, leg irons or waist chains shall be used on a\nfemale inmate (detainee) who is in labor, this includes while being transported to a medical\nfacility,” the parties dispute whether Sheriff Dart knew of the unwritten practice of shackling\npregnant detainees during labor, delivery, and/or recovery following delivery during the relevant\ntime period.  Specifically, Sheriff Dart asserts that he was unaware of the specific, day-to-day\nprocedures the correctional officers used in restraining pregnant detainees – as supported by\nnumerous Rule 30(b)(6) witnesses’ deposition testimony.  (Dart Stmt. Facts ¶¶ 48, 62, 63; R.\n248, Dart Add’l Stmt. Fact ¶ 1.)  On the other hand, citing to their Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C)\nAdditional Statement of Facts, the Individual Plaintiffs maintain that because Sheriff Dart had\npersonal involvement in many aspects of running the Cook County Jail, a reasonable juror could\ninfer that Sheriff Dart had knowledge of how correctional officers restrained pregnant detainees\nin labor.  The Individual Plaintiffs, however, did not file a Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) Additional\n20\n\nStatement of Facts in which they supposedly presented evidence of comments made in a press\nrelease, “internet admissions,” and articles on www.huffingtonpost.com, among other\nstatements.  See United States v. 5443 Suffield Terrace, Skokie, Ill., 607 F.3d 504, 510 (7th Cir.\n2010) (“summary judgment may only be defeated by pointing to admissible evidence in the\nsummary judgment record that creates a genuine issue of material fact.”).  In sum, the Individual\nPlaintiffs do not “set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,” see\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255, but only offer speculative arguments – not based on evidence – to\nsupport their claim that Sheriff Dart had knowledge and was personally involved in the shackling\npolicy.  See Truhlar v. United States Postal Serv., 600 F.3d 888, 893 (7th Cir. 2010)\n(“unsupported speculation is insufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment.”).  The\nCourt therefore grants Sheriff Dart’s motion for summary judgment as to the individual capacity\nclaim.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the these reasons, the Court denies the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment\nas to the Class Plaintiffs’ official capacity claim and state law negligence claim.  The Court\ngrants Sheriff Dart’s motion for summary judgment as to the individual capacity claim.  Because\nthe Court addressed Defendants’ objections to Plaintiffs’ Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) Responses in\nthe context of each fact, the Court denies Defendants’ motion to strike as moot.  The Court also\ndenies Plaintiffs’ conditional motion to defer Defendant Dart’s individual capacity claim\nsummary judgment motion as moot.\nDate: December 20, 2011\nENTERED \n_______________________________\nAMY J.

This is absurd: shackling a pregnant woman during labor \ncauses harm. \nThe  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists  has  con-\ncluded that ―[t]he practice of shackling an incarcerated woman in labor may \nnot only compromise her health care but is demeaning and unnecessary. . . . \nWomen [who have been shackled during labor] describe the inability to move \nto allay the pains of labor, the bruising caused by chain belts across the \nabdomen, and the deeply felt loss of dignity.‖ (Exhibit 1, infra, Letter, Ralph \nHale, MD to The Rebecca Project for Human Rights, June 12, 2007, available \nat  http://www.acog.org/departments/underserved/20070612SaarLTR.pdf, \nvisited September 14, 2009.) \nNamed plaintiff Simone Jackson could not walk to quicken her labor \nbecause defendants’ shackling policy required that she be shackled to her \nhospital bed. (Exhibit 2, infra, Jackson Dep. 42:17-21.) Defendants’ shackling \npolicy  thus  lengthened  the  amount  of  time  Jackson  spent  in  labor  and \nthereby increased the amount of her pain. This increase in the amount of \npain caused ―actual damages‖ because the unnecessary infliction of pain is \nactionable  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment \n-2- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 3 of 175 PageID #:302\nwithout proof of an ―objective‖ injury. Edwards v. Snyder, 478 F.3d 827, 832 \n(7th Cir. 2007).  \nII.  The Class Definition Is Not “Unworkable” \nDefendants assert that the proposed class definition is ―unworkable‖ \nbecause it includes woman ―who will be shackled‖ during labor. (Def.Mem. \n12.)  Defendants  do  not  contend  that  they  have  abandoned  the  Sheriff’s \nshackling policy. Nor do defendants deny that they intend to  continue to \nrequire the shackling of every woman who is transported from the jail to a \nhospital for childbirth. Thus, the number of woman aggrieved by the shack-\nling policy will continue to grow until the Sheriff abandons this policy. If, as \nplaintiffs request, the Court allows the case to proceed as a class action, every \nwoman who has been subjected to the shackling policy should be bound by \nthe final judgment.  \nDefendants are in error in asserting that plaintiffs could seek an in-\njunction to prohibit future use of the shackling policy. (Def.Mem. 12.) The law \nin this Circuit does not permit plaintiffs to obtain injunctive relief. Arreola v. \nGodinez, 546 F.3d 788, 799 (7th Cir. 2008) and Robinson v. City of Chicago, \n868 F.2d 959, 965-68 (7th Cir. 1989) foreclose any attempt by plaintiff to \nsecure injunctive relief, either individually or for a Rule 23(b)(2) class. \nDefendants are also mistaken in claiming that it is impossible to iden-\ntify  women aggrieved  by  the  shackling  policy.  (Def.Mem.  12.)  Defendants \nhave to date been able to locate ―documents which would reveal the names of \n-3- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 4 of 175 PageID #:303\npotential class members.‖ (Def.Mem. 13.) These documents – which do not \nfully satisfy plaintiffs’ outstanding discovery requests – identify 49 women (in \naddition to the five women who are parties to pending lawsuits) who gave \nbirth while in the custody of the Sheriff. The first and last names of these \nwomen are set out in Exhibit 3. (The last names are redacted in the public \nfiling of this memorandum.)  \nIII.  The Constitutionality of the Shackling Policy Should \nBe Decided on a Class Basis \nDefendants seek to argue that the constitutionality of the shackling \npolicy must be decided on a case by case basis. (Def.Mem. 5-6.) This argument \nis without merit because the Sheriff requires correctional officers to apply the \nshackling policy to all women giving birth who are in the custody of the \nSheriff  \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  defendant  Sheriff  requires  that  all  pregnant \nwomen in his custody be shackled during labor and during recovery following \nlabor. (Amended Complaint, ¶17.) Plaintiffs supported their motion for class \ncertification  with  the  Rule  30(b)(6)  deposition  of  Superintendent  Holmes \nshowing that this policy was in effect through at least though August of 2008. \n(Motion for Class Certification at 2, 4.) Sheriff Dart stated that the policy was \nstill being applied on June 25, 2009, when he publicly acknowledged and \ndefended the policy, explaining that ―[a]nytime a detainee is taken outside \nthe jail for medical treatment, he or she becomes an immediate escape risk.‖ \n(Exhibit 4, infra.) Plaintiffs confirmed that defendants continue to apply the \n-4- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 5 of 175 PageID #:304\nshackling  in  the  Rule  30(b)(6)  deposition  of  deposition  of  Superintendent \nHickerson (taken on July 9, 2009, after plaintiffs filed their class motion). \nSuperintendent Hickerson testified that the Sheriff has not made any \nchanges in his shackling policy after August of 2008. (Exhibit 5, Hickerson \nDeposition 33:5-8.) The Sheriff’s policy continues to be that when a pregnant \nwoman comes to a hospital for childbirth, ―we follow the procedures that we \nhave a Department of Corrections inmate.‖ (Exhibit 5, Hickerson Deposition \n41:17-19). As Hickerson explained (Exhibit 5, Hickerson Deposition 43:11-\n45:7): \nQ:  The  woman  from  Division  3  that  is  pregnant  and  was \nbrought to the hospital for purposes of childbirth would be \nshackled in a room, correct? \nHickerson: Correct. \n \nQ: And her leg – one leg would be shackled to the bed, correct? \nA: Yes, sir. \n \nQ: And a hand would be shackled to the bed? \nA: Cuffed to the bed. \n \nQ: Cuffed to the bed? \nA: Yes, sir. \n \nQ: The guard that’s sitting in the room, [44] the armed guard \nthat’s sitting in the room under the practice and policy of the \nSheriff would be required to shackle the female to her bed, \ncorrect? \nA: Yes. \n \nQ: The female who was pregnant and at the hospital from Divi-\nsion 3 for purposes of giving birth would remain shackled \npursuant  to  the  practice  of  the  Sheriff  up  until  the  point \nthere was a direction from a doctor, correct?  \nA. Yes.  \n \n-5- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 6 of 175 PageID #:305\n*** \nQ: For  a  woman  that's  in  Division  3  that's  hospitalized,  the \nguard upon notice or an order -- receiving an order from a \ndoctor would have to contact his or her supervisor in regards \nto the doctor's order to remove the shackles, correct? \nA: [45] Yes.  \n  \nQ: Only after the guard received approval from his or her su-\npervisor would the guard then remove the shackles from the \nwoman in Division 3 that is hospitalized for purposes of deli-\nvering a child?  \nA: Unless it was an emergency. \n \nPlaintiffs expect to prove that the Sheriff’s shackling policy is contrary \nto May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876 (7th Cir. 2000). There, the Seventh Circuit \nheld that ―the use of bodily restraints constitutes punishment in the constitu-\ntional sense if their use is not rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive \ngovernment purpose or they appear excessive in relation to the purpose they \nallegedly serve.‖ Id. at 884. Plaintiffs will support their case with evidence \nthat the Sheriff’s policy of shackling a woman while she is in labor, some-\ntimes removing the restraints for the actual delivery and then replacing the \nshackles immediately after childbirth, is not rationally related to any legiti-\nmate  non-punitive  government  purpose  and  is  plainly  excessive  when  an \narmed correctional officer is bedside during labor and delivery.1 \n                                            \n1 Defendants are mistaken in stating that this case is about ―the constitutionality \nof  the  application  of  a  statute  to  a  situation.‖  (Def.Mem.  5.)  Plaintiffs  are  not \nchallenging ―the constitutionality of the application of that Illinois statute [730 ILCS \n125/17.5] to a particular set of events.‖ (Def.Mem. 2.) Plaintiffs’ challenge is to the \nSheriff’s shackling policy, and not to any statute. \n \n-6- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 7 of 175 PageID #:306\nThe Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of Superintendent Holmes makes plain \nthat the shackling policy is applied to all hospitalized detainees (Exhibit 2 to \nClass Motion at 51:3-7); whether a baby is born through a vaginal birth or \nthrough cesarean delivery (Def.Mem. 5), is irrelevant. Plaintiffs’ challenge to \nthe shackling policy does not turn on whether the birthing mother is shackled \nhand and foot throughout delivery, or ―merely‖ handcuffed during delivery \nand then ―shackled only before and after delivery.‖ Id. Neither the ―particu-\nlars of  when  and  how  each plaintiff  was shackled  or  handcuffed  nor  the \nparticulars of the whole labor experience‖ (Def.Mem. 6), has any bearing on \nplaintiffs’ claim that, under May v. Sheahan, supra, defendants’ policy that \nall women be shackled during labor and immediately after delivery is uncons-\ntitutional. \nThe Seventh Circuit rejected a defendant’s similar attempt to change \nthe focus of a class claim in Murray v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948 \n(7th Cir. 2006), a consumer credit class action. There, the named plaintiff \nlimited  the  class  claim  to  statutory  damages,  declining  ―to  make  person-\nspecific arguments‖ that would have supported compensatory damages. Id. at \n953.  Defendant  argued  that  individual  determinations  were  nonetheless \nrequired; the district court agreed and denied class certification. Id. at 956. \nThe Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the legality of defendant’s \nconduct could be resolved from ―the four corners of the offer.‖ Id. In this case, \n-7- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 8 of 175 PageID #:307\nthe legality of defendants’ shackling policy can be resolved from the policy \nitself, without regard to any ―woman-specific argument.‖ \nMurray was applied by the district court in Jackson v. Sheriff, No. 6 \nCV 493, a case challenging the Sheriff’s now abandoned urethral swab policy. \nThere,  the  Sheriff  sought  to  argue  that  class  certification  was  improper \nbecause the legality of the procedure turned on whether each prisoner had \nconsented to the procedure. Jackson, supra, Mem.Op., December 14, 2006, at \n8 (attached as Exhibit 6). The district court rejected this argument, accepting \nplaintiffs’  framing  of  the  issue:  that  ―the  totality  of  circumstances  at  the \nreceiving unit makes it impossible for anyone to give a valid consent to the \ninsertion of the urethral swab.‖ (Exhibit 6 at 8.) The district judge in Jackson \nthus concluded that ―[t]his framing of the issue effectively shifts the debate \ntowards questions that are resolvable without delving into an individualized \nanalysis  of  minor  factual  discrepancies.‖  Id.  Plaintiffs  in  this  case  have \nsimilarly framed the issue to focus on the legality of the policy, irrespective of \n―minor factual discrepancies.‖ \n Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Sheriff’s shackling policy in this case has \nnothing  to  do  with  whether  a  baby  was  born through  a  vaginal  birth  or \nthrough cesarean delivery. (Def.Mem. 5.) Nor does plaintiffs’ challenge to the \nshackling policy turn on the type of restraints used. Id.  \nPlaintiffs do not bring this case to transform a ten-thousand dollar \nclaim into a one hundred million dollar claim. (Def.Mem. 11.) Plaintiffs have \n-8- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 9 of 175 PageID #:308\nexpressly requested, pursuant to Rule 23(C)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, that the case be maintained as a class action solely to adjudicate \nthe legality of the Sheriff’s shackling policy, and that all questions of damag-\nes  for  unnamed  members  of  the  class  be  reserved  to  individual  damage \nactions. As the Seventh Circuit wrote in Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Systems Corp., \n319 F.3d 910 (7th Cir. 2003), ―it makes good sense‖ to resolve the legality of \nthe shackling policy in ―one fell swoop while leaving the remaining, claimant-\nspecific issues to individual follow-on proceedings.‖ Id. at 911.  \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the Sheriff’s shackling policy is quite different \nfrom the claim of excessive detention before the Seventh Circuit in Harper v. \nSheriff,  No.  08-3413  (September  8,  2009).  There,  the  Court  of  Appeals \ndisapproved a district court’s order allowing a case to proceed as a  class \naction because the Seventh Circuit concluded that whether a person had been \nsubjected to an excessive length of detention could only be determined in an \nindividual basis because what is excessive would ―depend on how long each \ndetainee was held after bond was posted and what justifications there might \nbe for the delay on that particular day or for that particular detainee—the \ntime of day, whether the jail was processing an unusually large number of \ndetainees at that time, whether other events occurring at the jail legitimately \nslowed processing times, whether the detainee’s lack of cooperation delayed \nprocessing, etc.‖ Harper, slip op. 7. There are no individual factors in defen-\n-9- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 10 of 175 PageID #:309\ndants’ shackling policy, which requires shackling of all women who are taken \nfrom the Jail to a hospital for childbirth.  \nPlaintiffs  demonstrate  below  that  the  Court  should  overrule  defen-\ndants’ remaining objections to class certification.  \nIV.  Numerosity \nAfter plaintiffs filed their opening memorandum, defendants located \n―documents  which  would  reveal  the  names  of  potential  class  members.‖ \n(Def.Mem. 13.) Although defendants have yet to produce all of the documents \nrequested by plaintiffs, the documents produced to date identify 49 women \nwho have given birth while in the custody of the Sheriff. These women (with \nsurnames redacted in the public filing), are identified in Exhibit 3, infra  \nAlthough plaintiffs expect the actual class size to be greater than the \n49 persons identified to date, a class of 49 members satisfies the ―rule of \nthumb‖ for numerosity which this Court endorsed in Cotton v. Asset Accep-\ntance, LLC, No. 07-C-5005 (N.D.Ill. June 26, 2008, Exhibit 3 to Class Motion). \nThe Court should reject defendants’ challenge to numerosity. \nV.  Commonality \nDefendants advance the remarkable claim that ―plaintiffs have identi-\nfied  no  factual  or  legal  issues  common  to  the  class.‖  (Def.Mem.  7.)  This \ncontention is without merit: plaintiffs identified the common questions in \ntheir motion for class certification (at 6-7): \nThe common question in this case is whether the use of bodily \nrestraints on a pregnant woman during labor, delivery, or recov-\n-10- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 11 of 175 PageID #:310\nery following delivery is ―rationally related to a legitimate non-\npunitive government purpose,‖ as required by May v. Sheahan, \n226 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir. 2000). This question is ―common to \nall potential class members,‖ Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, \n798 (7th Cir. 2008), and satisfies the commonality requirement \nof Rule 23(a). \nThis case presents an overriding common question about the constitu-\ntonality of the use of bodily restraints on a pregnant woman during labor, \ndelivery and recovery following delivery. \nVI.  Typicality \nDefendants argue that the claims of the two named plaintiffs are not \ntypical of those of the class because ―Plaintiffs claim to draw class members \nfrom two sources, those in the MOMs program and those originating from \nDivision 3.‖ (Def.Mem. 8.) Defendants do not, however, present any evidence \nto support their claim that childbirth is different for a woman in the Sheriff’s \ncustody who is in the ―MOM’s program‖ than for a woman in the Sheriff’s \ncustody who is housed in ―Division 3.‖  \nDefendants assert that the ―MOM’s program‖ is a drug rehabilitation \nprogram, for which pregnant female detainees are ―screened, approved and \nplaced.‖ (Def.Mem. 8.) Defendants claim that those pregnant detainees who \nare not in the ―MOM’s program‖ are held in ―Division 3‖ because ―they chose \nnot  to  participate  in  MOM’s  or  were  ineligible  do[sic]  to  their  criminal \nrecord.‖ Id. Defendants do not, however, contend that the Sheriff’s shackling \npolicy is different for women in the ―MOM’s‖ program than for women in \n-11- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 12 of 175 PageID #:311\n―Division 3.‖ Accordingly, the Court should reject defendants’ challenge to the \ntypicality requirement. \nVII.  Adequacy \nDefendants assert that there is a conflict between the named plaintiffs \nand the unnamed members of the putative class because ―the interests of the \nremaining  class  members  cannot  be  identified  to  any  reasonable  degree.‖ \n(Def.Mem. 9.) This is an unusual and meritless objection. \nPersons who have been injured by application of an unlawful policy \nhave the identical interest in obtaining a remedy for that injury. Defendants \nare unable to show any conflict between the named plaintiffs and the un-\nnamed members of the putative class. Nor do defendants question the ability \nof  plaintiffs’  attorneys  to  represent  the  proposed  class.  The  Court  should \nreject defendants’ objections to the adequacy of the class representations tand \ntheir attorneys. \nVIII.  Rule 23(b)(3) \nDefendants agree than ―when a class challenges a uniform policy or \npractice, the validity of the policy or practice tends to be the predominant \nissue in the ensuing litigation.‖ (Def.Mem. 10.) Defendants assert in conclu-\nsory  fashion  that  the  constitutionality  of  the  shackling  policy  is  involves \n―highly individualized factual analyses.‖ Id. Nowhere in their memorandum, \nhowever, do defendants seek to identify these ―individualized factual analys-\nes.‖  This  silence  is  not  surprising:  there  are  no  ―individual  facts‖  about \n-12- \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 13 of 175 PageID #:312\nwhether the shackling policy requires that pregnant woman in the custody of \nthe Sheriff be shackled during labor and during recovery after childbirth. \nDefendants fail to acknowledge the superiority of a class action to re-\nsolve the legality of the shackling policy in a single proceeding. Defendants \npoint out that there are now four pending cases challenging the shackling \npolicy.2 (Def.Mem. 2, 5-6.) Absent class certification, a ruling on the merits of \nthe policy in any of the four cases would not be binding on the other three. \nBut when ―a class is certified, its members (unless they opt out of the class), \nand not just the named plaintiff, are bound by the judgment. Wiesmueller v. \nKosobucki, 513 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir. 2008).  \n   \n                                            \n2 Plaintiff do not, and will not, ―seek to join‖ the plaintiffs in those three \nindividual cases as class members. On the contrary, plaintiffs oppose defen-\ndants’ pending motion for reassignment of the three other cases.

Conclusion \nFor the reasons above stated and those previously advanced, plaintiffs \nrequest that the Court order that this case be maintained as a class action \nfor: \nAll women in the custody of defendant Sheriff on and after De-\ncember 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled during \nlabor, delivery, or recovery following delivery. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n /s/ Kenneth N.

This practice has already \nbeen outlawed in Illinois and in California.  ACOG’s District IX testified in support of the legislation in California: \n“Physical restraints have interfered with the ability of physicians to safely practice medicine by reducing their \nability to assess and evaluate the physical condition of the mother and the fetus, and have similarly made the labor \nand delivery process more difficult than it needs to be; thus, overall putting the health and lives of the women and \nunborn children at risk.  Typically these inmates have armed guards on-site, which should be more than adequate to \nprotect personnel helping a pregnant, laboring woman or to prevent her from fleeing.”  \nThe practice of shackling an incarcerated woman in labor may not only compromise her health care but is \ndemeaning and unnecessary.  Most women in correctional facilities are incarcerated for non-violent crimes and are \naccompanied by guards when they are cared for in medical facilities.  Testimonials from incarcerated women who \nwent through labor with shackles confirm the emotional distress and the physical pain caused by the restraints.  \nWomen describe the inability to move to allay the pains of labor, the bruising caused by chain belts across the \nabdomen, and the deeply felt loss of dignity. \nThe safety of hospital personnel is paramount and for this reason, adequate correctional staff must be \navailable to monitor incarcerated women in labor, both during transport to and from the correctional facility and \nduring the hospital stay.  However, the safety of personnel has not been compromised in the years since laws \npreventing shackling have been instituted in California and Illinois.  This safety track record demonstrates the \nfeasibility of preserving the dignity and providing compassionate care of incarcerated laboring women.  \nACOG is committed to high quality obstetric care for all women.  Incarcerated women in labor constitute a \nparticularly vulnerable population.  Preventing the practice of shackling these women is an important step toward \nassuring humanitarian care and social justice.

No.  But all my reports and things that\n    \n11     as far as my treatment in Haymarket file, as far\n    \n12     as that, my treatment.\n    \n13         Q.

So there's somebody at the MOMS program?\n    \n 7         A.   Uh-uh.  I have to be transferred to the\n    \n 8     hospital to truly determine that I am in labor.\n    \n 9         Q.   I guess -- this may sound silly.  What\n    \n10     prompts that?  How do you notify the MOMS people\n    \n11     to take you?  What is required?  I mean do they\n    \n12     do a check on you, a medical check on you in MOMS\n    \n13     to say, well, we better go over this -- you\n    \n14     better go over to Stroger?  Or is this by your\n    \n15     word only?\n    \n16         A.   Basically, yes, it's by my word of -- I\n    \n17     don't want to say maybe.  It's by my word and the\n    \n18     symptoms that I described to them to say that,\n    \n19     okay, we'll make a phone call and call the\n    \n20     ambulance.\n    \n21         Q.   Symptoms that would be commonplace?\n    \n22         A.   With labor, yes.\n    \n23         Q.   Okay.  And that's what happened in your\n    \n24     case?\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 27\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 45 of 175 PageID #:344\n28\n    \n 1         A.   Yes.\n    \n    \n    \n 2         Q.   Okay.  So then you're taken then to\n    \n 3     Stroger, correct?\n    \n 4         A.   Well, not just taken to Stroger.\n    \n 5     They'll call an ambulance.  The ambulance, they\n    \n 6     make the decision on what hospital I go to.  It\n    \n 7     was usually Mount Sinai or Stroger.  I just\n    \n 8     happened to get Stroger.\n    \n 9         Q.   Okay.  Tell us then, why don't you tell\n    \n10     us in your case back on May 5th what happened\n    \n11     that day?\n    \n12         A.   May 5th?\n    \n13         Q.

I went to the office, told them\n    \n 8     that my back was hurting very bad and I believe I\n    \n 9     was in labor.  This was my sixth child, so I'm\n    \n10     pretty aware about labor.  They told me\n    \n11     that -- they had to call the sheriff department\n    \n12     and call the director, you know, the things and\n    \n13     can I hold on.  So I let them do that.  Took a\n    \n14     shower.  Got my bag ready.\n    \n15         Q.   Okay.\n    \n16         A.   And waited for the ambulance.  The\n    \n17     ambulance came.\n    \n18         Q.

Other than the straps so you don't fall\n    \n14     out, were you put in any type of leg irons or\n    \n15     handcuffs or any restraints at all?\n    \n16         A.   No.\n    \n17         Q.

I know\n    \n16     I was prepped.

Did the doctor ever say something like\n    \n20     take the handcuffs off or did you hear him say\n    \n21     anything relating to you being shackled?\n    \n22         A.

And they\n    \n 5     said if I sat in this position -- because they\n    \n 6     talking amongst the sheriff, if they can\n    \n 7     unshackle me.  If I laid in this position, would\n    \n 8     I be -- can I still be shackled.  If I laid, took\n    \n 9     it another position, I would have to be\n    \n10     unshackled.  So they made the decision to keep me\n    \n11     shackled while I got the epidural.\n    \n12         Q.   Did you have to sit up for the epidural?\n    \n13         A.

And like I said, I'm\n    \n 9     there but I'm aware, I believe I'm aware.  So I'm\n    \n10     still shackled.  I'm shackled, because they\n    \n11     taken -- they got to transfer me to another bed.\n    \n12     And that's how I know I'm shackled.\n    \n13         Q.   Why did they do that?\n    \n14         A.   I'm not in an actual delivery room when\n    \n15     you stay in.  Some rooms are where you can\n    \n16     deliver and stay in the same room.

I also\n    \n 5     take care of my baby with the handcuffs and the\n    \n 6     blue box.  The blue box is a device that going\n    \n 7     between the chain of the handcuffs.  And that's\n    \n 8     put on me, too.  So I'm lifting my baby out the\n    \n 9     crib with my hands, like a puppy.  I'm also being\n    \n10     checked by somebody else, like the police\n    \n11     is -- the sheriff is put on me and then somebody\n    \n12     else in black uniform that come up and check,\n    \n13     make sure they locked.

So the blue box, that\n    \n13     replaced the what?\n    \n14         A.   No, it didn't replace anything.  It made\n    \n15     it more -- what I'm trying to say I'm handcuffed.\n    \n16     Standard handcuff.  The blue box what I'm saying\n    \n17     in between that.  So it makes it even heavier.\n    \n18         MS. SHAPIRO:  So you can't move your\n    \n19     hands --\n    \n20         MR. MORISSEY:  Objection, only one person.\n    \n21         MS.

Let's just say you don't know why?\n    \n    \n    \n 2         A.   Right.  It's blue.  And I guess so you\n    \n 3     won't -- it's heavy.  So it can be heavy.\n    \n 4         Q.   How heavy is it?\n    \n 5         A.   Oh, maybe four or five pounds.\n    \n 6         Q.   Four or five pounds?\n    \n 7         A.

Because it's in the middle\n    \n11     of my wrist, so I have to lift it up.\n    \n12         Q.   How much to your best guess, how\n    \n13     much --\n    \n14         A.   Standard.  It's a standard -- it goes to\n    \n15     the width of the handcuff.\n    \n16         Q.   Okay.  And what about your ankles, other\n    \n17     than the electronic monitoring bracelet, were\n    \n18     there any shackles on your ankles?\n    \n19         A.   Yes.\n    \n20         Q.   How was that?  How did that work?\n    \n21         A.   It was one shackle, one cuff with a\n    \n22     chain to go around inside the bed railing of the\n    \n23     bed and locked to me.\n    \n24         Q.   24 hours a day?\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 53\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 71 of 175 PageID #:370\n54\n    \n 1         A.   24 hours a day.\n    \n    \n    \n 2         Q.   So it's your testimony that you were\n    \n 3     never able to use the bathroom that was in the\n    \n 4     room?\n    \n 5         A.   Right.  I never used it.\n    \n 6         Q.

They\n    \n10     would --\n    \n11         Q.   Did they give you a sponge bath?\n    \n12         A.   Yeah, I would take a sponge.  They\n    \n13     wouldn't give it to me.  When I had to use the\n    \n14     bathroom, I would have to call the nurse.  And\n    \n15     the nurses said that I was -- they wasn't really\n    \n16     aware I was shackled.  They thought I was being\n    \n17     lazy.\n    \n18         Q.   Do you know why they thought that, they\n    \n19     would think that?\n    \n20         A.   I don't think they was aware that\n    \n21     why -- why I think that, because I felt --\n    \n22         Q.   If you know.\n    \n23         MR. MORISSEY:  Objection.

Wasn't no phone calls\n    \n13     allowed.\n    \n14         Q.   And the baby's in the room with you?\n    \n15         A.   Yeah.\n    \n16         Q.   And you stayed there until --\n    \n17         A.   The 5th.  I did also have a surgery\n    \n18     while I was there.  I received a tubal ligation\n    \n19     too.\n    \n20         Q.   What's that?\n    \n21         A.   That's where the tubes are closed up so\n    \n22     you wouldn't have no more babies.  And I was\n    \n23     shackled during that procedure, too.  And I was\n    \n24     also --\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 55\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 73 of 175 PageID #:372\n56\n    \n 1         Q.   Let's stop there.

When I say you're shackled, I think we\n    \n17     can agree that it's always in either the\n    \n18     left -- the one wrist or the right wrist or\n    \n19     you're in the blue box, right?\n    \n20         A.

Yes.\n    \n 4         Q.   And shackled again?\n    \n 5         A.   And I'm shackled again.  And I go to the\n    \n 6     ER.\n    \n 7         Q.

Afternoon.  I'm not sure of the time.\n    \n20     But it's afternoon.\n    \n21         Q.   Let's go back, because this took me by\n    \n22     surprise.\n    \n23                   Did you make that decision -- was\n    \n24     that already arranged for you to have the surgery\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 57\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 75 of 175 PageID #:374\n58\n    \n 1     done?\n    \n    \n    \n 2         A.

I worked it out with the -- my ob-gyne\n    \n 6     to -- when I had the baby that I have my tubes\n    \n 7     tied.  So it's a procedure that has to be\n    \n 8     approved like maybe 30 days before I had a baby.\n    \n 9     So like my eighth month, seventh month.\n    \n10         Q.   Okay.  That's good enough.  Okay.\n    \n11                   Now, so then tell me what you\n    \n12     remember about the operating room, the OR.\n    \n13         A.   Okay.  Prior to going to that, the\n    \n14     anesthesiologist came out and said that I\n    \n15     couldn't come into the operating room with the\n    \n16     shackles on because of the magnetic force in the\n    \n17     light.  And that he also stated to the officers\n    \n18     that he didn't want the shackles on because I\n    \n19     would be under anesthesia and I wouldn't be able\n    \n20     to move anywhere and there's no purpose for that.\n    \n21                   So she said she was following\n    \n22     orders.  And he said, well, he didn't want them\n    \n23     on because it was a risk.  So they called\n    \n24     captains and they came up with a soft shackle.\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2  Page 58\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 76 of 175 PageID #:375\n59\n    \n 1         Q.

So I stayed in the hallway about four\n    \n 5     hours until they found what they needed to find.\n    \n 6     Okay.  So I end up going in surgery -- finally\n    \n 7     going surgery with soft shackles.  I come out to\n    \n 8     the recovery.  When I wake up I'm in the recovery\n    \n 9     room and I'm shackled.  Now I got on the regular\n    \n10     shackles.\n    \n11         Q.

I didn't have to tell nobody.  It was a\n    \n15     procedure that was being done, but -- at Stroger.\n    \n16     Let me say this.

Yes, sir. \n \n           19        Q.    Was this form in existence at the time \n \n           20     that you were superintendent? \n \n           21        A.

What is the \n \n            2     purpose of it? \n \n            3        A.    It is an informational sheet for the \n \n            4     supervisors to check to see if there's any \n \n            5     pertinent information day to day as to what \n \n            6     happened with the patient, or the inmate I \n \n            7     should say. \n \n            8        Q.    What information is contained on the \n \n            9     form? \n \n           10        A.    The officer that's assigned there \n \n           11     signs the sheet.  The sergeant that is making \n \n           12     rounds signs the sheet.  Any lunch relief \n \n           13     officers would sign the sheet.  Any notations \n \n           14     for doctors' orders or requests would have \n \n           15     that, as well. \n \n           16        Q.    Does the form also indicate whether or \n \n           17     not the prisoner was shackled during the course \n \n           18     of the day? \n \n           19        A.    Yes. \n \n           20        Q.    Why does this form indicate when a \n \n           21     prisoner/detainee is handcuffed or the \n \n           22     handcuffs are removed? \n \n           23        A.

That's part of our protocol.  If \n \n            2     you're going to remove restraints, we need to \n \n            3     document it and notify your supervisor. \n \n            4        Q.    It would be correct, then, to say that \n \n            5     the protocol or practice of the Sheriff was for \n \n            6     the guards to have the hospitalized inmate \n \n            7     shackled? \n \n            8        A.    Correct. \n \n            9        Q.    At all times, correct? \n \n           10        A.    Correct. \n \n           11        Q.

Shackling the leg to the bedframe and \n \n           13     the hand to the other part of the bedframe. \n \n           14        Q.

Yes, sir. \n \n           19        Q.    And is it correct that this standard \n \n           20     form is used to note when, if at all, the \n \n           21     shackles are removed by the guards during the \n \n           22     course of a day, correct? \n \n           23        A.

Yes, sir. \n \n            5        Q.    And if there is no notation on the \n \n            6     form, the assumption would be that the detainee \n \n            7     was shackled during that period of time, \n \n            8     correct? \n \n            9        A.

If they were allowed to go to the \n \n           16     bathroom, they would remove the shackles from \n \n           17     the bedframe and then re-shackle both legs and \n \n           18     allow them to go to the bathroom; if they were \n \n           19     being moved for a test; if a doctor requested \n \n           20     it. \n \n           21              But before any of this happens, they \n \n           22     must notify the supervisor on duty unless it's \n \n           23     an emergency situation.

Would it be correct to state that the \n \n            3     practice of the Sheriff was before any shackle \n \n            4     was removed from a hospitalized detainee that \n \n            5     the guard that was watching the detainee would \n \n            6     have to seek the approval of a supervisor? \n \n            7        A.    Other than life-threatening. \n \n            8        Q.    By \"life-threatening,\" what do you \n \n            9     mean? \n \n           10        A.    A doctor said the cuffs or shackles \n \n           11     have to come off or this person is going to \n \n           12     die.  That would be life-threatening. \n \n           13        Q.

I don't understand the question. \n \n           17        Q.    The question is:  If a detainee was in \n \n           18     a hospital room, was there a practice and prior \n \n           19     to August of 2008, of having a guard assigned \n \n           20     to the room with the hospitalized detainee? \n \n           21        A.

For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is\nGRANTED. \nBACKGROUND1\nThe instant Plaintiffs were admitted to the Cook County Jail as pre-trial detainees at\nvarying dates,2 where they were allegedly forced to undergo a screening test for sexually\n1For the purposes of this motion, Plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations are taken as true. \nSee Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 179 (1974).  \n2Jackson was admitted on February 4, 2004, McGrath on December 27, 2005, and Smith\non July 20, 2004.\n-1-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 163 of 175 PageID #:462\ntransmitted disease (“STD screening”).  Though some details of their accounts vary, the general\nprocess was the same in all cases.  Upon arriving at the jail, Plaintiffs signed medical release\nforms and questionnaires as part of the admission procedure.  One of these forms contained a\n“Consent for Treatment” decree, apparently signed by all three putative representatives, that read\nas follows:\nI consent to a medical and mental health history and physical including\nscreening for tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases as part of the\nintake process of the Cook County Jail....[signed by prisoner].\nSee Resp. to Cert. Mot. Ex. A at 18, Ex. B at 16, Ex. C at 17.  All admitted prisoners were lined\nup to enter an examination room within the medical intake area.  Once inside, a medical\ntechnician from Cermak Health Services asked the prisoners to lower their pants.  The technician\nwould then insert a cotton swab into the tip of each prisoner’s penis, apparently in order to\ncollect a tissue sample for testing.3  At all times, jail deputies were nearby, though it is not\nentirely clear where they were usually stationed with respect to the examination area.4  \nOn January 27, 2006, Plaintiff Jackson filed a complaint alleging violation of his\nconstitutional rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1983. \nThe Complaint was amended on January 31, 2006 to include additional Plaintiffs McGrath and\nSmith, and corrected on February 1, 2006.  Plaintiffs in this case have now filed a motion for\nclass certification.  The putative plaintiff class consists of “[a]ll male prisoners at the Cook\nCounty Jail who, on and after January 27, 2004, was [sic] subjected to the non-consensual\n3The particulars of this particular point in the process vary, as some accounts claim that:\nthe swabbing was done over a garbage can; the technician failed to change his glove before\nadministering the test to subsequent prisoners; and that either the prisoner held his own penis\nduring the procedure or his penis was held by the technician.\n4See, e.g., Smith Dep. at 51 (placing the guard in the doorway of the room).\n-2-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 164 of 175 PageID #:463\ninsertion of a swab into this penis as part of his admission to the jail.”  Cert. Mot. at 1.  In\nsupport of their motion to certify the class, Plaintiffs have submitted fourteen (14) “Sworn\nDeclarations” from men who had been admitted into the Cook County Jail.5  See Cert. Mot., Ex.\n1.  These declarations rely upon roughly identical text to state their support of the class and the\ndeclarant’s potential membership in it:6\nThe undersigned, under penalties of perjury, certifies that the following\nstatement are [sic] true:\n1-2. [summary of individual’s biographical information, including\nname, date of admission, CIMIS number, and age at the time]\n3. On admission to the Cook County Jail, I was subjected to a\nprocedure which I understand to be known as the insertion of a\nurethral swab into my penis.\n4. I did not consent to this procedure [and tried to refuse].\n5. I would not have agreed to undergo this procedure if I had been\ngiven a choice.\n6. The procedure was painful and an embarrassing intrusion into a\nprivate part of my body.\n7. I was in pain for [___] day(s) after the procedure.\n8. The person who performed the procedure held my penis with his\nhand while inserting the swab. \nId.  \n5These declarations were made by: Kamal J. Davis, Troy O. Hampton, Lawrence A.\nHoward, Crasseros Jackson, Jerome Johnson, Thomas Kelly, Sylvester Kimbrew, Larry E.\nLawson, Kevin McDuffie, Calvin K. Odisho, Vincent D. Papaccio, Leonard Pitman, Michael\nRodriguez, and John O. Williams. \n6Bracketed language indicates wording that varied from one declaration to another, or\nwhich was absent from one or more of the declations.\n-3-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 3\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 165 of 175 PageID #:464\nLEGAL BACKGROUND\nThe federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide the federal district courts with broad\ndiscretion to determine whether certification of a class-action lawsuit is appropriate.  Keele v.\nWexler, 149 F.3d 589 (7th Cir. 1998).  When evaluating a motion for class certification, the court\naccepts as true all well-pleaded allegations made in support of certification.  Eisen v. Carlisle &\nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 179 (1974); Hardin v. Harshberger, 814 F.Supp. 703, 706 (N.D.Ill.\n1993).  The party seeking class certification bears the burden of showing that the requirements\nfor the class certification have been met.  Carlisle, 417 U.S. at 179; see also Patterson v. Gen.\nMotors Corp., 631 F.2d 476, 480 (7th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 914 (1981).    Failure to\nestablish any one of the requirements precludes class certification. Retired Chicago Police Ass'n\nv. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584 (7th Cir. 1993).  \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs the requirements of class\ncertification. Under that rule, deciding a motion for certification requires a two-step analysis. \nFirst, the named plaintiff must satisfy the four threshold pre-requisites of Rule 23(a): (1)\nnumerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) adequacy of representation.  Second, the\naction must qualify under one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b); in this instance, the\nPlaintiffs seek to qualify under 23(b)(3), meaning they must establish that questions common to\nall members of the class predominate and that a class action would be the most effective\napproach to resolving the matter.  In order to determine whether or not these criteria have been\nmet, it is not appropriate to examine the substantive merits of the case itself.  Eisen v. Carlisle &\nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974) (finding that the court deciding certification has no\n“authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether\n-4-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 166 of 175 PageID #:465\nit may be maintained as a class action”).  Nonetheless, it is necessary to “make a ‘preliminary\ninquiry...that has as its focus not the substantive strenth or weakness of the plaintiffs’ claims but\nrather the merits of those allegations that bear on the suitability of a case for class treatment\nunder Rule 23(a) and (b).’”  Rahim v. Sheahan, 2001 WL 1263493 at *10 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 19,\n2001) (quoting Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2001)).\nANALYSIS\nBecause the Plaintiff have met all of the prerequisites of 23(a), as well as the criteria of\n23(b)(3), their motion for class certification is GRANTED.\nNumerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) is satisfied if “the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.”  This places a positive burden on the party seeking to certify the class to show\nthat there are enough class members that it would not make sense to bring them all into court.\nPlaintiffs are not required to specify the exact number of class members.  Vergara v. Hampton,\n581 F.2d 1281, 1284 (7th Cir. 1978).  An approximation of the proposed class size can be based\non common-sense assumptions and estimates.  Gaspar v. Linvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 56 (D.\nIll. 1996).  However, failure to provide an estimate, or means for making such an estimate, can\nprove fatal to a certification motion.  Marcial v. Coronet Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 954, 957 (7th Cir.\n1989) (holding that plaintiffs “cannot rely on conclusory allegations that joinder is impractical or\non speculation as to the size of the class in order to prove numerosity”) (citing Valentino v.\nHowlett, 528 F.2d 975, 978 (7th Cir. 1976)).  While there is no set minimum number of plaintiffs\nrequired for class certification, Courts have generally recognized that joinder is impracticable\nwhere a class contains more than 40 members.  Johnson v. Rohr-Ville Motors, Inc., 189 F.R.D.\n-5-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 5\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 167 of 175 PageID #:466\n363, 368 (D. Ill. 1999) (citing Swanson v. Am. Consumer Indus., Inc., 415 F.2d 1326, 1333 (7th\nCir. 1969).\nDefendants are correct that Plaintiffs have not given this Court a definite idea of how\nmany members its putative class will contain.  At present, it is only clear from the record that\nseventeen current or former prisoners have a potential claim against Defendants; the three named\nPlaintiffs and the additional fourteen declarants.7  While the definiteness of the total number of\nclass members is a factor to consider in weighing considerations for or against certification, in\nthis instance it is nonetheless clear that the putative class will be sufficiently large.  As Plaintiffs\npreviously stated, the alleged “invasive procedure has been applied to more than one thousand\npersons from January 27, 2004 to the present.”  Cert. Mot. at at 1.  The class will likely expand\nto include nearly all prisoners admitted into the Cook County Jail within the Plaintiffs’ proposed\ntemporal range.  Though somewhat variable due to prisoners who opt out, or unusual cases in\nwhich the roughly standardized procedures were not applied, it is clear that this putative class is\nsufficiently numerous for determining that certification would be more efficient than resolution\nthrough joinder or multiple legal actions.8\n7Defendants maintain that because the supporting declarations use boilerplate language\ntheir veracity as personalized accounts is suspect and they should not be given significant\nweight.  However, repeated language does not prove that the experience was not common to all\nof these declarants, and there was in fact some effort to individualize the declarations, e.g., the\nmedical technician's approach, or the number of days of pain following the procedure, differed\nfrom one account to another.  \n8 Plaintiffs’ fourteen declarations were collected by contacting only three days’ worth of\nprisoners admitted into the Cook County Jail.  Cert. Mot. at 2-4; Resp. to Cert. Mot. at 5.  Even\nif class membership were limited to prisoners who sign such a declaration, Plaintiffs have thus\nfar gained an average of 4b additional members for every considered day of admission into the\njail.  The proposed definition of the class, which would cover all prisoners admitted since\nJanuary 27, 2004, would cover hundreds of days, and would therefore provide the requisite\n-6-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 6\n\nCase:  1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 168 of 175 PageID #:467\nDefendant maintains that a mailing was sent to all prisoners currently held in the Cook\nCounty Jail system.  Plaintiffs admit that this is true.  Reply in Supp. of Cert. Mot. at 4 . \nDefendant also argues that Plaintiffs have had adequate time to seek out declarants regarding the\ntypicality of the allegations and have only had limited success in their efforts.  Resp. to Cert.\nMot. at 5.  However, Plaintiffs failure to more definitely determine the ultimate size of the class,\ndespite their time and effort, is not terminal.  As stated above, this class action will likely include\na large majority of prisoners who have had the screening process applied to them, and a\nsufficiently high number of class members to warrant the greater efficiency of the class action\nprocess.  Because enough information has been provided to make this determination, Plaintiffs\nhave relied on more than mere “conclusory allegations that joinder is impractical or on\nspeculation as to the size of the class in order to prove numerosity.”  See Marcial, 880 F.2d at\n957.  Rather, they have provided adequate information from which a large, if indefinite, number\nof class members can be discerned.\nCommonality/Typicality9\nRule 23(a)(2) calls for the \"existence of at least one issue of fact or law common to all\nclass members.\"  Meiresonne v. Marriott Corp., 124 F.R.D. 619, 622 (D. Ill. 1989).  \"A common\nnucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule\n23(a)(2),” id., and under the rule the existence of some factual variation among class members\nwill not defeat a class action, Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992).  \nnumerosity.\n9These two criteria are often analyzed together, see Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013,\n1017 (7th Cir. 1992), as this Court now does.\n-7-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 7\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 169 of 175 PageID #:468\nPlaintiffs assert that there are several common questions of fact or law, namely: \nIs the procedure undertaken without consent?  And, if so, is consent\nrequired by the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments?\nDoes the Procedure violate rights secured by the Fourth and/or Fourteenth\nAmendments?\nIs the manner in which the procedure is performed reasonably calculated\nto spread disease and, if so, is this a violation of rights secured by the\nFourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments?\nPl.’s Cert.

While there are some factual discrepancies among members of the\nputative plaintiff class, there are nonetheless common issues of fact and law to justify class\ncertification.\nDefendants rely too much on select factual determinations that might bary on a case-by-\ncase basis, and which in some way might affect the screening process for individual putative\nclass members.  Rather than seeking to establish that the prisoner consent was valid in some\ninstances and invalid in others, Plaintiffs maintain that, as a rule, the manner in which the\nscreening process is conducted precludes valid consent: “Plaintiffs intend to show in their\nimpending motion for summary judgment that the totality of circumstances at the receiving unit\nmakes it impossible for anyone to give a valid consent to the insertion of the urethral swab.” \nPl.’s Reply in Supp. of Class Cert. at 11.  This framing of the issue effectively shifts the debate\ntoward questions that are resolvable without delving into an individualized analysis of minor\nfactual discrepancies.  See, e.g.,  Murray v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948, 955 (7th Cir.\n2006) (upholding class certification despite member differences because the answers to the\ndistinguishing question – the presence or absence of a firm offer – were not dispositive of the\nultimate legal determinations).\n-8-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 8\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 170 of 175 PageID #:469\nSimilarly, the class definition satisfies the demands of Rule 23(a)(3), which requires that\nthe claims of the class representatives be typical of those of other class members.  A typical\nclaim arises “from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of\nother class members and his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.”  De La Fuente v.\nStokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983).  Further, “similarity of legal theory\nmay control even in the face of different facts.” Id.  Here, the underlying factual basis was the\nsame for all prisoners admitted to the Cook County jail; they were all admitted and screened, and\na variety of different factors may or may not have combined to invalidate the boilerplate consent\nthat they gave.  The legal argument that comes out of this is that the prisoners’ constitutional\nrights under the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments were violated.  Despite minor difference\nin how the underlying process was executed, this indeed suffices to establish that all prisoners\nthat underwent this screening share a common nucleus of facts, and that the Plaintiffs’ legal\ntheory would carry over to any of them.\nRepresentativeness\n Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiff “fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.”  This inquiry is generally broken into two component parts: (1) whether\nPlaintiff's counsel possesses the sufficient qualifications and experience to litigate a class action\nlawsuit in federal court; and (2) whether Plaintiff has interests that are antagonistic to or in\nconflict with those of other class members.  \nDefendant has not challenged the general adequacy of counsel in this case, and this Court\nsees no reason to doubt that it is adequate.  Defendant does raise a question about the techniques\nused by Plaintiffs’ counsel in finding their clients in this instance.  Resp. to Cert. Mot. at 4. \n-9-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 9\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 171 of 175 PageID #:470\nHowever, this is unavailing – whether or not Plaintiffs were fully aware of their constitutional\nprotections before they were approached by Mr. Flaxman and Mr. Morrissey has little to do with\ncounsel’s ability to zealously advocate for the entire class from this point forward.  \nIn addition, there is nothing to indicate that the Plaintiffs’ interests will be “antagonistic\nto those of the rest of the class.”  While Defendants make a great deal out of the Second Circuit’s\nchoice to consider Plaintiffs’ credibility of individuals, Resp. to Cert. Mot. at 8-9, they have not\nadvanced evidence of dishonesty that would make this Court question their ability to stand as\nclass representatives.  Defendants’ suggestion that McGrath’s status as an “admitted heroin\naddict” should make his credibility “highly suspect” is not convincing, see Resp. to Cert. Mot. at\n9,  particularly where class membership is made up entirely of prisoners, many of whom have a\nhistory of criminality and/or drug abuse. \nPredominance of Common Questions\nRule 23(b)(3), which provides the grounds for Plaintiffs’ motion, requires that “questions\nof law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the\nfair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.”   Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591,\n615 (1997).  “The matters pertinent to the finding [under Rule 23(b)(3)] include: (a) the interest\nof members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate\nactions; (b) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already\ncommenced by or against members of the class; (c) the desirability or undesirability of\nconcentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (d) the difficulties likely to be\nencountered in the management of a class action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In considering these\n-10-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 10\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 172 of 175 PageID #:471\nrequirements, “the court must review the substantive elements of plaintiffs’ cause of action, the\nproof necessary for the various elements and the manageability of the trial on these isuses.” \nRodriguez v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 2002 WL 655679 at *4 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 18, 2002) (citing\nSimer, 661 F.2d at 672)).  “Where liability determinations are both individual and fact-intensive,\nclass certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is improper.”  Oshawa, 225 F.R.D. at 584 (citing\nRodriguez, 2002 WL 655679 at *4)).\nThe “predominant” question is whether or not Defendants unconstitutionally performed\nthe screening process without achieving valid consent from the prisoners.  Largely because of\nthe manner in which Plaintiff has framed this question – as a categorical determination that\napplies to all individuals subjected to that process – there is no reason to think that minor factual\ndiscrepancies will counterbalance the importance of this overarching issue.  The most difficult\nand all-encompassing question of consent, and Defendants’ alleged nefarious intent, can be\ndecided and applied to all potential members.  These questions will predominate, addressing far\nweightier factual and legal issues than minor individual deviations from the standard jail\npractices in question. \nThe second part of 23(b)(1)(3) requires “that a class action is superior to other available\nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.”  It is true that individualized\nfactfinding with respect to each putative class member can undermine the potential benefits of\nclass action status.  See Fisher v. Britol-Myers Squibb Co., 181 F.R.D. 365, 373 (N.D. Ill. 1998)\n(finding that there is little efficiency when court would need to engage in“extensive\nindividualized proceedings regardless of whether we certify a class”); Crato v. Estate of Kassel,\n63 F.R.D. 18 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) (finding certification of plaintiff class, or subgroups of a plaintiff\n-11-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 11\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 173 of 175 PageID #:472\nclass, inappropriate in case of fraud because each member would be required to testify on the\nrepresentations that were made to them).  However, in this instance the factual determination\nrequired in every given instance would be a relatively straightforward one; if the Plaintiffs\nsuccessfully establish that the screening process was necessarily non-consensual, determining\nmembership would be a simple matter of deciding who went through that process.  Any\nadditional factual analysis of individual circumstances would be limited, as stated above.\nEven if it were necessary to conduct a mini-hearing to establish that each of the\nindividual putative class members was indeed subject to the practices outlined in Plaintiffs’\nallegations, which should not be the case, this would still be more efficiently done if this court is\nfirst able to categorically address the alleged unconstitutional process itself.  To rehear this same\nquestion for each prisoner defies logic, and the case therefore demands the efficiency of scale\nthat Rule 23 provides.  As the matter is framed by Plaintiffs, membership in the class will be\ndetermined by whether or not a given prisoner underwent the STD screening.  This is well within\nthe realm of reasonable membership determinations that courts of this circuit have found\nappropriate in the past.\n This outcome is supported by the application of another, implicit requirement that this\ncircuit has read into the explicit criteria of Rule 23; that the definition of the proposed class be\n\"adequately defined and clearly ascertainable.\"  Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 669 (7th Cir. 1981). \nIf Plaintiffs were in fact arguing that some of the prisoners admitted into the Cook County Jail\nhad consented, the margins of that class would be subjective and difficult to determine without a\nthorough factual analysis of each prisoner's experience.  If that were the case, Plaintiffs would\nfail to meet the implicit criterion adopted by the Seventh Circuit.  Id.  However where, as here,\n-12-\n Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 Page 12\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/14/09 Page 174 of 175 PageID #:473\nthe Plaintiffs maintain that the process itself is constitutionally suspect, they have presented an\nissue that can and should be addressed categorically with respect to all similarly-situated\nprisoners.  \nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is GRANTED.\nEnter:\n/s/ David H.

This  is  a  civil  action  arising  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is conferred by 28 U.S. C. §1343 and 28 U.S.C. \n§1367. \n2.  Plaintiffs Catherine Zaborowski, Simone Jackson, Nicole Blair, \nLisa  Brown,  Danielle  Bryant,  Isabel  Carmona,  Mariane  Cruz,  Jennifer \nFarrar,  Cora  Fletcher,  Denae  Johnson,  Deborah  Lee,  Felicia  Ligon, \nAngela Oss, Sheena Richardson, Bennetta Sidney, Monique Starnes, and \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 2 of 31 PageID #:899\nLatania Walton are residents of the Northern District of Illinois. As set \nout below with greater specificity, each plaintiff was in the custody of the \nSheriff of Cook County immediately before and immediately after she gave \nbirth at Stroger Hospital. \n3.  Defendants are Thomas J. Dart, the Sheriff of Cook County, \nand Cook County, Illinois. The Sheriff is sued in his individual and official \ncapacity,  as  set  out  below  with  greater  specificity.  Plaintiffs  join  the \nCounty pursuant to Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle County, 324 F. 3d 947 (7th \nCir. 2003). \n4.  Defendant Dart became the Sheriff of Cook County in 2006 and \noversees nearly 10,000 detainees and 3,000 correctional officers at the Cook \nCounty Jail. \n5.  Dart  has  at  all  times  been  personally  involved  in  the \nformulation and implementation of policies at the Cook County Jail.   \na.  Upon taking office as Sheriff, Dart instituted changes at \nthe  Cook  County  Jail,  installing  new  technologies, \nincluding introducing body-scanning machines to prevent \ncontraband  from  getting  inside,  while  also  raising \nstandards for employment. \n-2- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 3 of 31 PageID #:900\nb.  Shortly after taking office in December of 2006, Dart began \nto conduct weekly “accountability meetings,” during which \nall high ranking Jail staffers are required to give detailed \nreports on activities in their respective divisions of the Jail.  \nc.  Under the direction of defendant Dart, a “Weapons Free \nCommittee” was formed at the Jail to collect, inventory, \nand analyze all inmate-made shanks and weapons with the \ngoal of reducing inmate and staff injuries. \nd.  In 2007, defendant Dart formed a “blue ribbon” committee \nof  former  U.S.  Attorneys  and  other  legal  and  law \nenforcement  experts  to  evaluate  the  Sheriff’s  internal \naffairs operations. \ne.  Dart selected and hired a consultant to train correctional \nofficers on how to better recognize and supervise inmates \nwith mental health issues. \nf.  Before Dart became Sheriff, detainees were not permitted \nto  have  contact  visits  with  their  minor  children.  Dart \nchanged this policy  in May of 2008, when he authorized \ncontact visits between female detainees and their children.  \n-3- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 4 of 31 PageID #:901\ng.  Dart has been personally involved in the operation of the \n13,000 square foot garden located on the grounds of the \nCook County Jail that is used to train detainees. \n6.  At the same time that he adopted and implemented the above \ndescribed progressive policies, defendant Dart permitted the continuation \nof an official policy (hereinafter “shackling policy”) requiring correctional \nofficers to shackle pregnant woman, who are in the custody of the Sheriff \nof Cook County, before, during, and immediately after labor and delivery.  \n7.  Defendant  Dart’s  shackling  policy  implements  a  barbaric \npractice that needlessly inflicts excruciating pain and humiliation: \na.   Shackling a pregnant woman during and immediately after \nthe birthing process poses an obvious and substantial risk \nof harm to the woman’s health and safety. \nb.  A  pregnant  woman  who  is  shackled  during  the  birthing \nprocess  will  often  soil  her  bedsheets,  causing  actual \ndiscomfort and humiliation and subjecting the woman to a \nserious risk of infection.  \nc.   A woman who is shackled during labor is unable to move \nto allay the pains of labor, and will often incur bruising \nfrom the shackles and experience a loss of dignity.  \n-4- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 5 of 31 PageID #:902\n8.  Defendant Dart has enforced his shackling policy in willful and \nwanton disregard of the laws of the State of Illinois: At all times relevant, \nthere has been in force and effect an Illinois statute, compiled as 55 ILCS \n5/3-15003.6, that provides as follows: \nPregnant  female  prisoners.  Notwithstanding  any  other \nstatue,  directive,  or  administrative  regulation,  when  a \npregnant  female  prisoner  is  brought  to  a  hospital  form  a \nCounty Department of Corrections facility for the purpose of \ndelivering her baby, no handcuffs, shackles, or restraints of \nany  kind  may  be  used  during  her  transport  to  a  medical \nfacility  for  the  purpose  of  delivering  her  baby.  Under  no \ncircumstances may leg irons or shackles or waist shackles be \nused on any pregnant female prisoner who is in labor. Upon \nthe pregnant prisoner’s entry to the hospital delivery room, a \ncounty  correctional  officer  must  be  posted  immediately \noutside  the  delivery  room.  The  Sheriff  must  provide  for \nadequate personnel to monitor the pregnant female prisoner \nduring her transport to and from the hospital and during her \nstay at the hospital.  \n9.  Defendant Dart has enforced his shackling policy in deliberate \nindifference to the laws of the United States: \na.  Defendant Dart’s shackling policy violates the Convention \nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment  or  Punishment  (the  “Torture  Convention”), \nG.A. Res. 46, 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 51), U.N. Doc. \nA/39/51 (1984). The  United States ratified this treaty in \n1994. \n-5- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 6 of 31 PageID #:903\nb.  Defendant  Dart’s  shackling  policy  also  violates  the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the \n“ICCPR”),  GA  res.  2200A  (XXI),  21  U.N.  GAOR  Supp. \n(No.  16)  at  art.  7,  U.N.  Doc.  A/6316  (1966).  The  United \nStates ratified this treaty in 1992. \n10.  Defendant Dart has enforced his shackling policy in deliberate \nindifference to clearly established federal law: \na.  In  1980,  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the \nSeventh Circuit held that it was settled law that pretrial \ndetainees may not be shackled without a good penological \nor medical reason.    \nb.  At  some  time  after  December  1,  2007,  defendant  Dart \nlearned that the widespread practice at the Cook County \nJail was that pregnant female detainees would be \ni.  Shackled while being transported to a hospital for \nlabor and delivery, and/or \nii.  Shackled during labor and delivery; and/or  \niii.  Shackled during recovery after labor, \n11.  After learning of the widespread shackling practices referred \nto above, defendant Dark knew that unlawful and unconstitutional policies \n-6- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 7 of 31 PageID #:904\nwere being applied to pregnant female detainees in his custody before, \nduring, and after childbirth. \n12.  Notwithstanding  his  actual  knowledge  that  unlawful  and \nunconstitutional policies were being applied to pregnant female detainees \nin his custody before, during, and after childbirth, defendant Dart sought \nto  conceal  the  unlawful  policy  by  making  false  public  statements  that \nshackling  was  necessary  because  many  female  detainees  have  escaped \nfrom custody during childbirth. Dart also made the false public statement \nthat shackling a detainee before, during, and after childbirth conforms to \nIllinois law. \n13.  Defendant  Dart  delayed  for  more  than  one  year  in  taking  \nremedial  action  after  he  learned  that  unlawful  and  unconstitutional \nshackling policies were being applied to pregnant female detainees in his \ncustody before, during, and after childbirth. As set out below with greater \nspecificity,  plaintiffs  Blair,  Brown,  Bryant,  Carmona,  Cruz,  Farrar, \nFletcher,  Johnson,  Lee,  Ligon,  Oss,  Richardson,  Sidney,  Starnes,  and \nWalton were each subjected to the shackling policy because of defendant \nDart’s failure to intervene and take action to correct the unlawful policy \nafter he acquired personal knowledge that, notwithstanding clearly settled \n-7- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 8 of 31 PageID #:905\nfederal  law  and  the  unambiguous  state  statute,  female  detainees  were \nbeing shackled before, during, and after childbirth. \nThe Class Claim and the Class Representatives \n14.  Plaintiff Zaborowski entered the Cook County Jail on June 3, \n2008; plaintiff Jackson entered the Jail on November 23, 2007.   \n15.  Zaborowski and Jackson were each pregnant when she entered \nthe jail. \n16.  Pursuant to the policies of defendant Sheriff, Zaborowski and \nJackson  were  each  transferred  from  the  Jail  to  the  Sheriff’s  “MOM’s” \nprogram, an off-site, residential treatment program run by the Haymarket \nCenter. \n17.   Plaintiff Zaborowski went into labor on August 29, 2008 and \nwas taken by a counselor from the Haymarket Center to Stroger Hospital. \nZaborowski  was  not  handcuffed  or  otherwise  restrained  while  she  was \nbeing taken to the hospital.  \n18.  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance \nwith  the  policies  of  defendants,  deputy  sheriffs  shackled  plaintiff \nZaborowski hand and foot to a hospital bed.    \n-8- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 9 of 31 PageID #:906\n19.  Plaintiff Zaborowski remained shackled hand and foot to the \nhospital bed for about eleven hours while she was in labor.  An armed \ndeputy sheriff remained in the hospital room while plaintiff was in labor. \n20.   Immediately  before  the  birth,  the  attending  physician \nrequested the deputy sheriff to unshackle plaintiff Zaborowski’s foot.  The \ndeputy complied with this request and Zaborowski was shackled to the bed \nby one arm when she delivered her child at about 8:15 a.m. on August 30, \n2008. \n21.  In  accordance  with  the  policies  of  defendants,  the  deputy \nsheriff  re-shackled  plaintiff  Zaborowski’s  foot  about  an  hour  after  the \nbirth. \n22.  Plaintiff  Zaborowski  remained  at  Stroger  Hospital  until  the \nevening of the next day, September 1, 2008.  During this period, and as \nrequired by defendants’ policies, Zaborowski was shackled hand and foot \nto the hospital bed and was not permitted to use the toilet or to get up \nfrom the bed to walk  \n23.  Plaintiff Jackson went into labor on May 3, 2008 and was taken \nby her counselor from the Haymarket Center to Stroger Hospital. Jackson \nwas not handcuffed or otherwise restrained while she was being taken to \nthe hospital.  \n-9- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 10 of 31 PageID #:907\n24.  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance \nwith the policies of defendants, deputy sheriffs shackled plaintiff Jackson \nhand and foot to a hospital bed.    \n25.  Plaintiff  Jackson  remained  shackled  hand  and  foot  to  the \nhospital bed while she was in labor and during birth.  An armed deputy \nsheriff remained in the hospital room while plaintiff was in labor and was \npresent when plaintiff delivered her child while shackled. \n26.  Plaintiff Jackson remained at Stroger Hospital for about four \ndays.  During this period, and as required by defendants’ policies, Jackson \nwas shackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was not permitted to \nuse the toilet or to get up from the bed to walk. \n27.  Jackson and Zaborowski were each deprived of rights secured \nby the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States by defendant Dart’s above described shackling policy.   \n28.  Jackson and Zaborowski were each damaged as the direct and \nproximate result of defendant Dart’s failure and or refusal to implement \nthe above referred Illinois statute.  \n29.  As a direct and proximate result of defendant Dart’s shackling \npolicy,   and by defendant Dart’s failure and or refusal to implement the \nabove referred Illinois statute, plaintiffs and all other persons subjected to \n-10- \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 131 Filed: 09/21/10 Page 11 of 31 PageID #:908\nthe  above  referred  policy  were  unreasonably  restrained,  subjected  to \npunishment, incurred great emotional and physical pain and suffering. \n30.  Plaintiffs Jackson and Zaborowski bring this action individually \nand for all women in the custody of defendant Sheriff who, in the two year \nperiod preceding the filing of this lawsuit, were shackled during labor and \nafter delivery.

Class counsel esti-\nmate that each class member will receive an award ranging between five \nthousand dollars and forty-five thousand dollars.

The Magistrate Judge will resolve any dispute about the appropri-\nate point-count; to discourage meritless appeals, the point-count of any \nclass member who is unsuccessful in her challenge will be reduced. The \nsettlement also incorporates an agreement that class counsel will be paid \nattorneys’ fees in the amount of 25% of the total settlement fund of four \nmillion one hundred thousand dollars ($4,100,000).

RECITALS  \n1.  Nature of litigation. Plaintiffs filed the above captioned ac-\ntion, for themselves and all others similarly situated, in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 and 730 ILCS 125/17.5.  \n2.  Class Certification. Pursuant to the Court's order of June 22, \n2010, this case is proceeding as a class action for:  \nAll women in the custody of defendant Sheriff on and \nafter December 4, 2006 who have been or who will be \nshackled during labor, delivery, or recovery following \ndelivery.  \n-1- \n \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 6 of 36 PageID #:5603\n3.   Important Rulings. On December 20, 2011, the Court grant-\ned Sheriff Dart’s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ individual \ncapacity claim and denied cross motions for summary judgment on the offi-\ncial capacity claims. The Court denied defendants’ motion to reconsider on \nJanuary 19, 2012. \n4.   Settlement Process. Counsel for the parties met with Magis-\ntrate Judge Valdez on May 11, 2010, November 16, 2010, and again on Feb-\nruary 3, 2012 to explore the possibility of settlement. The final settlement \nconference resulted in a settlement in principle, subject to approval by the \nCook County Board. The proposed settlement takes into account the risks, \ndelay and difficulties involved in establishing a right to recovery in excess \nof that offered by this settlement and the likelihood that the litigation will \nbe further protracted.  \n5.  Certification by Class Counsel: Class Counsel have investi-\ngated the facts and the applicable law and believes that the number of \nclass members is less than one hundred persons. Based on the foregoing, \nand on an analysis of the benefits that this Settlement Agreement affords \nthe class, Class Counsel considers it to be in the best interest of the class to \nenter into this Settlement Agreement.  \n6.  Denial of Liability: Cook County and Sheriff vigorously con-\ntests each and every claim in this action. Cook County and Sheriff maintain \nthat they have consistently acted in accordance with governing laws at all \ntimes. Cook County and Sheriff vigorously deny all the material allega-\ntions set forth in the Action. Cook County and Sheriff nonetheless have \n-2- \n \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 7 of 36 PageID #:5604\nconcluded that it is in its best interest that the Action be settled on the \nterms and conditions set forth in this agreement. Cook County reached \nthis conclusion after considering the factual and legal issues in the Action, \nthe substantial benefits of a final resolution of the Action, the expense that \nwould be necessary to defend the Action through trial and any appeals that \nmight be taken, the benefits of disposing of protracted and complex litiga-\ntion, and the desire of Cook County to conduct its business unhampered by \nthe distractions of continued litigation.  \n7.  As a result of the foregoing, Cook County and Sheriff enter in-\nto this Stipulation without in any way acknowledging any fault, liability, or \nwrongdoing of any kind. Neither this Stipulation, nor any of its terms or \nprovisions, nor any of the negotiations or proceedings connected with it, \nshall be construed as an admission or concession by Cook County and Sher-\niff of the truth of any of the allegations made in the Action, or of any liabil-\nity, fault, or wrongdoing of any kind whatsoever on the part of Cook Coun-\nty or Sheriff, or shall be used as precedent in the future against Cook \nCounty and Sheriff in any way.  \n8.  To the extent permitted by law, neither this Stipulation, nor \nany of its terms or provisions, nor any of the negotiations or proceedings \nconnected with it, shall be offered as evidence or received in evidence in \nany pending or future civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceed-\ning, to establish any liability or admission by Cook County and/or Sheriff, \nexcept in any proceedings brought to enforce the Stipulation.  \n-3- \n \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 3\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 8 of 36 PageID #:5605\n9.

The parties, while recognizing \nthat each class member with a valid claim has a distinct claim for damages, \nagree  that  the  expense,  uncertainly,  and  delay  of  providing  each  class \nmember with an individual determination of damages outweighs the bene-\nfits of a categorical distribution. Counsel for the parties also recognize that \nmost class members would benefit from counseling provided in conjunction \nwith a monetary award. Accordingly, the parties agree that class counsel, \nshall assign “points” to each class member and that the payment to each \nclass member shall be computed by dividing two million seven hundred \nand twenty thousand dollars ($2,720,000) by the total number of points to \nobtain the dollar value of each point, and that each class member shall re-\nceive, subject to the payout procedures set out below, the number of points \nmultiplied by the dollar value per point. Counsel estimate that payments to \nclass members will range from five thousand dollars to forty-five thousand \ndollars. \n14.  Assignment of “Points” to Class Members. Class counsel, \nwith the advice of  Defense counsel, and subject to challenge by a class \n-7- \n \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 7\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 12 of 36 PageID #:5609\nmember, shall assign to each class member a “point score” in accordance \nwith the following rating system: \na.

One point to each class member who is a named party in this \naction. \ng.  One  additional  point  to  class  representatives  Catherine \nZaborowski and Simone Jackson.   \n-8- \n \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 1 Page 8\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 13 of 36 PageID #:5610\nAny challenge by a class member to her point total shall be resolved \nby the Magistrate Judge, whose decision shall be final and not sub-\nject to review by the Court.

Accordingly, the parties agree that one \nhundred thousand dollars ($100,000) shall be reserved from the settlement \nfund for the sole and exclusive purpose of providing such services. The \nparties will agree in advance of the final settlement hearing on the identity \nof the program providers for these services.

This  document  describes  the  proposed  settlement  and  gives  instructions \nabout what you must do if you are a class member and a) wish to participate in the \nsettlement or b) exclude yourself form this case, or c) if you believe that the proposed \nsettlement should not be approved. \nPLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY \nTHIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF A LAWSUIT AGAINST YOU. \nYOU MAY BENEFIT FROM READING THIS NOTICE \nWHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT \nThe plaintiffs in this action are the class of persons identified above. The de-\nfendants are the Sheriff of Cook County and Cook County, Illinois. The named plain-\ntiffs filed this action, for themselves and others similarly situated, in the United \nStates District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging violations of rights \nsecured by the federal and state law.  \nOn June 22, 2010, United States District Judge Amy J. St. Eve ordered that \nthe case may proceed as a class action. Thereafter, after the parties had fully pre-\npared for trial, counsel for the parties were able to negotiate a settlement. \nTHE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \nCounsel for the parties have agreed to a settlement of all claims at issue in \nthis case. Defendants have agreed to pay $4,100,000 to cover damages for class \nmembers, incentive awards for the named plaintiffs, fees and costs of counsel, and \nadministrative expenses.  \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 3 Page 1\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 30 of 36 PageID #:5627\nTwo million seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars ($2,720,000) is allo-\ncated in the settlement for payment to class members. If the Court approves the \nproposed settlement, each class member will receive an award determined by the \nnature and extent of restraint during labor and post-delivery recovery. Each class \nmember will be assigned a number of points, ranging from one to a maximum of \nnine. Class counsel estimates that class members will receive an award of more than \nfive thousand dollars per point, or awards ranging from five to forty-five thousand \ndollars:   \nRestrained while being transported to a  One point \nhospital while in labor, but did not give \nbirth  \nRestrained while being transported to a  One point \nhospital while in labor and gave birth \nRestrained for thirty minutes or more  Two point \nwhile in labor at a hospital \nShackled while giving birth  Two point \nRestrained during post-delivery  One point \nrecovery \nA named party   One point \nA class representative  One point \nPayments to class members are subject to any state, federal, or other valid \nliens, including Medicaid liens and will be made in three installments. The first \npayment will be made within 60 days following the Court’s approval of the settle-\nment, and will be 40% of the class member’s projected share of the settlement. The \nsecond installment shall be in the same amount as the first installment, and will be \npaid after completion of a counseling program (described below), or with the third \nand final installment on the one-year anniversary of the date the Court approves \nthis settlement, \nOne hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of the settlement is allocated for \ncounseling class members on issues relating to employment, education, housing, \npersonal needs and family relations. Attorneys’ fees and costs, which were negotiat-\ned after full agreement had been reached on the monetary relief for the class, will be \npaid by defendants in the amount of $1,025,000, or 25% of the settlement fund.  \nRELEASE \nIf you participate in this settlement, you will give the Defendants a “release” \nwhich means that you cannot sue about anything not pending in court that arises \nout of your incarceration at the Cook County Jail. \nCLASS COUNSEL’S OPINIONS \nThe class is represented by attorneys Thomas G. Morrissey, 12049 South \nWestern Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, 60643 (773) 238-4235 and Kenneth N. Flaxman, \n200 South Michigan Avenue, Suite 1240, Chicago, Illinois 60604 (312) 698-9084. \nClass Counsel has investigated the facts and the applicable law and consider this \nsettlement to be in the best interest of the class. \nNO ADMISSION OF LIABILITY \n By settling this lawsuit, Defendants are not admitting that they have done \nanything wrong.  Defendants expressly deny any wrongdoing. \n-2- \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit 3 Page 2\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 298 Filed: 05/17/12 Page 31 of 36 PageID #:5628\n NOW, THEREFORE, NOTICE: \nA hearing will be held before this Court in Courtroom 1241, United States \nCourthouse, 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604, on ________ __, \n2012 at __:__ _.m., or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard.

[329].  The \nCourt denies Plaintiffs’ motion to stay judgment pending appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 8(a) as moot.  [330]. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \n  This motion pertains to the parties’ settlement agreement in this lawsuit that class \nPlaintiffs originally filed in 2008.  As discussed in the Court’s October 2017 ruling, after the \nCourt conducted a fairness hearing on August 30, 2012, the Court approved the parties’ \nsettlement agreement and the Court dismissed this lawsuit with prejudice on August 30, 2013.  \nPursuant to the settlement agreement, any settlement funds remaining after the distribution to the \nclass members were to be used for the Maternal Objective Management (“MOMS”) program \nadministered by the not-for-profit Haymarket Center.  On December 14, 2016, the parties filed \nan agreed motion to close out the administration of the settlement that the Court granted on \nJanuary 4, 2017.  On that same date, the Court required counsel to prepare and submit a proposed \norder.  Counsel failed to do so at that time.   \n \n  Instead, on September 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion to close the administration of \nthe settlement in which Plaintiffs argued that the remaining balance of the settlement funds \nshould be paid to the Haymarket Center pursuant to the settlement agreement.  Defendant Sheriff \nof Cook County then moved for relief from the Court’s final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) \nseeking to prevent payment of the remaining settlement funds to the Haymarket Center because \nthe Sheriff’s Office did not renew its contract with the Haymarket Center in relation to the \nMOMS program at issue in the settlement agreement.  At the September 27, 2017 status hearing, \nthe Court entered the parties’ motions, including the Haymarket Center’s motion to intervene, \nand directed the parties to file position papers with respect to the Court’s jurisdiction by October \n4, 2017.  The Sheriff’s Office and Haymarket Center filed jurisdictional memoranda by the \ndeadline asserting that the Court had jurisdiction to modify the final judgment pursuant to Rule \n \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 337 Filed: 04/09/18 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:5994\n60(b).  On October 19, 2017, the Court, in its discretion, granted Defendant’s Rule 60(b)(6) \nmotion based on the exceptional circumstances in this matter and allowed Defendant to retain the \nbalance of the settlement funds by placing the funds in a special purpose account with Cook \nCounty for the limited purpose of providing in-house counseling and treatment to women in the \nSheriff’s custody who otherwise would have been served by the MOMS program.  In that ruling, \nthe Court denied the Haymarket Center’s Rule 24(a)(2) motion to intervene.   \n \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n   Rule 59(e) permits parties to file, within twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment, a \nmotion to alter or amend the judgment.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).  Motions under Rule 59(e) serve \nthe limited function of allowing the Court to correct manifest errors of law or fact or consider \nnewly discovered material evidence.  See Baker v. Lindgren, 856 F.3d 498, 507 (7th Cir. 2017). \n“A ‘manifest error’ occurs when the district court commits a ‘wholesale disregard, \nmisapplication, or failure to recognize controlling precedent.’”  Burritt v. Ditlefsen, 807 F.3d \n239, 253 (7th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted); see also Stragapede v. City of Evanston, Ill., 865  \nF.3d 861, 868 (7th Cir. 2017).  A “Rule 59 motion is not a forum to relitigate losing arguments” \nsee NLRB v. Latino Exp., Inc., 776 F.3d 469, 478 (7th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted), namely, it is \nnot the proper vehicle to rehash previously rejected arguments.  See Vesely v. Armslist LLC, 762 \nF.3d 661, 666 (7th Cir. 2014).  District courts have broad discretion in determining Rule 59(e) \nmotions.  See Stragapede, 865 F.3d at 868. \n \nANALYSIS \n \n  As discussed, the Court relied on Rule 60(b) to amend the final judgment in its October \n2017 ruling.  See Kapco Mfg. Co. v. C & O Enter., Inc., 773 F.2d 151, 154 (7th Cir. 1985) (Rule \n60(b) is “a method of reopening a closed case” that was “devised to give the district court a \npower of revisitation it had lacked” by allowing the court to modify judgments).  Under the \ncircumstances of this lawsuit, Defendant Sheriff has been more than willing to pay the settlement \namounts under the parties’ settlement agreement, and thus issues of non-performance and breach \nof contract – that are typical in motions to enforce settlements – have never been at issue.  \nInstead, due to budgetary restraints, the Sheriff’s Office no longer uses the Haymarket Center for \nthe benefit of women in the Sheriff’s custody, but rather provides for abuse and treatment \nservices in-house.  Despite this change in circumstances, Plaintiffs’ class counsel takes the \nposition that the Haymarket Center should receive the funds although the funds would no longer \nbenefit the women in the Sheriff’s custody.   \n   \n  In the present motion, Plaintiffs argue that the Court made a manifest error of law \nbecause the Court did not have jurisdiction to alter or modify the final judgment because the \nterms of the settlement agreement were not incorporated into the August 2012 Order of \nDismissal.  See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994); see, e.g., \nNatkin v. Winfrey, No. 1:99-CV-05367, 2015 WL 8484511, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 8, 2015).  For \nthe first time in the present motion, Plaintiffs’ counsel explains that a “dismissal order’s mere \nreference to the fact of settlement does not incorporate the settlement agreement in the dismissal \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 337 Filed: 04/09/18 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:5994\norder.”1  Miener By & Through Miener v. Missouri Dep’t of Mental Health, 62 F.3d 1126, 1128 \n(8th Cir. 1995).   \n \n  Under this precedent, the Court must determine whether its August 2012 dismissal order \nembodied or incorporated the settlement agreement.  See Miener, 62 F.3d at 1128 (“although \nKokkonen does not state how a district court may incorporate a settlement agreement in a \ndismissal order, the case does suggest the agreement must be ‘embod[ied]’ in the dismissal \norder.”).  Not long after the Supreme Court decided Kokkonen, the Seventh Circuit explained \nthat “if the judgment explicitly incorporates the settlement, or reserves authority to enforce the \nsettlement, the court possesses ancillary jurisdiction.”  Lucille v. City of Chicago, 31 F.3d 546, \n548 (7th Cir. 1994).  In Lucille, the Seventh Circuit looked to whether the dismissal order \ncontained the terms of the settlement agreement in ascertaining the district court’s jurisdiction.  \nSee id. at 548-49; see also Jones v. Ass’n of Flight Attendants-CWA, 778 F.3d 571, 573 (7th Cir. \n2015). \n \n  Based on this precedent and turning to the August 30, 2012 Order of Dismissal, the \ndismissal order did not embody or incorporate the terms of the settlement agreement.  The Order \nstates as follows: \n \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n \nThe Court has reviewed the proposed settlement of this class action and, having \nheld a hearing on the fairness of the settlement, with no objection having been \nfiled, finds that notice of the proposed settlement has been provided to all class \nmembers by first class mail to her last known address and that the proposed \nsettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that \nthe proposed settlement be, and the same hereby is, approved. \n \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED: \n \n1. This case is dismissed without prejudice with leave to reinstate on or \nbefore August 30, 2013. \n \n2. In the event a motion to reinstate is not filed on or before August 30, \n2013, the case shall be deemed dismissed with prejudice without further \norder of the Court. \n \n3. The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement \nagreement until, and including, August 30, 2013. \n                                                           \n1 Despite the timing of Plaintiffs’ argument, the Court must address challenges to its subject \nmatter jurisdiction at any time or stage of the proceedings.  See Travelers Prop. Cas. v. Good, \n689 F.3d 714, 718 (7th Cir. 2012) (“Jurisdictional objections cannot be forfeited or waived, of \ncourse, for this court has an ‘independent obligation to satisfy itself that federal subject matter \njurisdiction exists.’”) (citation omitted). \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 337 Filed: 04/09/18 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:5994\n \n4. Defendant Cook County shall pay to attorneys Kenneth N. Flaxman and \nThomas G. Morrissey the sum of $80,000 as reimbursement for expenses \nand $1,025,000 as compensation for attorneys fees, the fees to be paid in \ntwo installments as set out in the settlement agreement. \n \n(R. 305, 8/30/12, Order of Dismissal.) \n \n  Although the Court referenced the settlement agreement in the dismissal order, the order \ndid not discuss any specific terms of the settlement, including, for purposes of this motion, ¶ 16 \nof the settlement agreement entitled “Payout Procedure” that discusses the remaining balance of \nthe settlement funds.  Under these circumstances, the Court did not have jurisdiction to modify \nthe judgment. \n \n  It remains unclear why class counsel wants the remainder of the settlement funds to go to \na facility that does not serve the class members.  Indeed, at the September 27, 2017 motion \nhearing, counsel unequivocally stated “obviously, representing the class members, we would like \nit to go to programs that would benefit the class exclusively.”  (R. 336, 9/27/17 Hr’g Tr. at 9.)  \nThat being said, because the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this matter, this \nquestion will remain unanswered.   \n   \n \nDated:  April 9, 2018       ______________________________ \n            AMY J.

[320].  The Court denies the \nHaymarket Center’s Rule 24(a)(2) motion to intervene in which it seeks to enforce the settlement \nagreement.  [318].  Further, the Court denies as moot Plaintiffs’ motion to close the \nadministration of the settlement because the Court already granted the parties’ agreed motion to \nclose out the administration of the settlement on January 4, 2017.  [316].  Plaintiffs and \nDefendant must submit an agreed proposed final order in accordance with this ruling by no later \nthan October 26, 2017. \n \nSTATEMENT \n \n  After conducting a fairness hearing, on August 30, 2012, the Court approved the parties’ \nsettlement agreement and the Court dismissed this lawsuit with prejudice on August 30, 2013.  \nPursuant to the settlement agreement, any settlement funds remaining after the distribution to the \nclass members are to be used for the Maternal Objective Management (“MOMS”) program \nadministered by the not-for-profit Haymarket Center.  On December 14, 2016, the parties filed \nan agreed motion to close out the administration of the settlement that the Court granted on \nJanuary 4, 2017.  On that same date, the Court required counsel to prepare and submit a proposed \norder.  Counsel failed to do so.  On September 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the present motion and \nproposed order, which includes that the remaining balance of the settlement funds shall be paid \nto the Haymarket Center pursuant to the settlement agreement.  Defendant Sheriff of Cook \nCounty then moved for relief from the Court’s final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) seeking \nto prevent payment of the remaining settlement funds to the Haymarket Center because the \nSheriff’s Office did not renew its contract with the Haymarket Center in relation to the MOMS \nprogram at issue in the settlement agreement.  For the following reasons, the Court, in its \ndiscretion grants Defendant’s Rule 60(b)(6) motion based on the exceptional circumstances in \nthis matter.  Banks v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 750 F.3d 663, 668 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Relief under this \nprovision is an ‘extraordinary remedy’ and should be granted only in ‘exceptional \ncircumstances.’”). \n \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 327 Filed: 10/19/17 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:5919\n \n \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n  “Rule 60(b) allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding.” \nNelson v. Napolitano, 657 F.3d 586, 589 (7th Cir. 2011).  “Rule 60(b)(6) is a catch-all provision \nthat allows a judgment to be set aside for ‘any other reason that justifies relief[.]’”  Philos Techs., \nInc. v. Philos & D, Inc., 802 F.3d 905, 917 (7th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  “A motion under \nthe ‘catchall’ provision contained in Rule 60(b)(6) [] must be made ‘within a reasonable time.’”  \nArrieta v. Battaglia, 461 F.3d 861, 865 (7th Cir. 2006).  “[W]hat constitutes ‘reasonable time’ \nfor a filing under Rule 60(b) depends on the facts of each case.”  Ingram v. Merrill Lynch, \nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 371 F.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam).1  The Seventh \nCircuit reviews the denial of a motion brought under Rule 60(b) for an abuse of discretion.  \nPhilos Techs., 802 F.3d at 917; see also Bakery Machinery & Fabrication, Inc. v. Traditional \nBaking, Inc., 570 F.3d 845, 848 (7th Cir. 2009) (“The district court has great latitude in making a \nRule 60(b) decision because that decision is discretion piled on discretion.”) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nANALYSIS \n \n    The Court first notes that the Sheriff’s Office is not seeking to enforce the settlement, \nbut instead, it seeks to modify or amend the final judgment, which the Court can consider under \nRule 60(b)(6).  On the other hand, the Haymarket Center has moved to intervene and seeks to \nenforce the settlement.  The Court, however, does not have jurisdiction to enforce the settlement \nagreement because pursuant to the order of dismissal, the Court dismissed this lawsuit with \nprejudice on August 30, 2013.  See Dupuy v. McEwen, 495 F.3d 807, 809 (7th Cir. 2007) (“when \na suit is dismissed with prejudice, it is gone, and the district court cannot adjudicate disputes \narising out of the settlement that led to the dismissal”); Shapo v. Engle, 463 F.3d 641, 643 (7th \nCir. 2006) (“district court does not have jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement merely \nbecause the agreement was the premise of the court’s dismissal of the suit that the agreement \nsettled”).  In addition, a party cannot intervene in a case that is no longer pending.  See NAACP v. \nNew York, 413 U.S. 345, 365 (1973) (Under Rule 24, “the court where the action is pending must \nfirst be satisfied as to timeliness”).  Accordingly, the Court denies the Haymarket Center’s \nmotion to intervene. \n \n  As the Court explained in its December 20, 2011 summary judgment ruling, in 1999, the \nSheriff’s Office created the Department of Women’s Justice Services (“DWJS”) that specifically \nfocuses on women offenders.  The DWJS’s mission is to create integrated programs and services \nthat break the intergenerational cycle of trauma, addiction, and crime for women and their \nchildren.  At that time, these goals were achieved through various programs, including the \nMOMs program, which was a residential program located outside of the Cook County Jail \nComplex at the Haymarket Center.  The MOMS program provided pregnant and postpartum \n                                                           \n1 Based on the unique facts of this case and the events occurring after the entry of the final \njudgment, the Court concludes that Defendant has filed this motion within a “reasonable time.”  \nSee Ingram, 371 F.3d at 952; Lowe v. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 361 F.3d 335, 342 (7th Cir. \n2004). \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 327 Filed: 10/19/17 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:5920\ndetainees treatment for mental health, physical health, and substance abuse, as well as other \nsupportive services.  \n \n  In the present Rule 60(b)(6) motion, the Sheriff’s Office maintains that it no longer uses \nthe MOMS program at Haymarket Center and that the Sheriff’s Office provides the substance \nabuse and treatment services previously provided by the MOMS program.  Neither Plaintiff nor \nthe Haymarket Center dispute this fact.  The Sheriff’s Office argues that because it is impossible \nfor the settlement balance to be used by Haymarket Center for the benefit of women in the \nSheriff’s custody as provided in the settlement agreement, it seeks to amend the final judgment \nallowing the Sheriff’s Office to retain the balance of the settlement funds by placing them in a \nspecial purpose fund account with Cook County for the limited purpose of supporting a \n“MOMS” type program within the Sheriff’s Office.  The Court agrees. \n \n  The parties’ settlement is for the benefit of the women in the Sheriff Office’s custody, not \nthe Haymarket Center.  The Court has no doubt the not-for-profit Haymarket Center’s MOMS \nprogram – that serves the Chicago area at large – has successful treatment programs.  That being \nsaid, the settlement agreement between Plaintiffs and the Sheriff’s Office concerned women who \nwere in the Sheriff’s custody.  Because the Sheriff’s Office no longer has a contract with the \nHaymarket Center in conjunction with the MOMS program, but instead provides for abuse and \ntreatment services in-house, the best solution is to amend the judgment allowing the Sheriff’s \nOffice to retain the balance of the settlement funds by placing the funds in a special purpose \naccount with Cook County for the limited purpose of providing in-house counseling and \ntreatment to women in the Sheriff’s custody who otherwise would have been served by the \nMOMS program.  The funds must be used for this limited purpose.  Therefore, the Court, in its \ndiscretion, grants Defendant’s Rule 60(b)(6) based on these exceptional circumstances.  \n \n \n \n \nDated:  October 19, 2017      ______________________________ \n            AMY J.

The Court will not entertain any motions for\nreconsideration as to this order because the parties have had ample opportunity to make their arguments.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Notices mailed by Judicial staff.\nSTATEMENT\n           \n           On January 28, 2009, Plaintiffs Catherine Zaborowski and Simone Jackson, on behalf of a class, filed\nan Amended Complaint alleging that Defendants Sheriff of Cook County and Cook County, Illinois have an\nunconstitutional policy pertaining to pregnant women in custody.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  On December 9,\n2009, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  The Court presumes familiarity with its\nDecember 9, 2009 order.  In addition, on March 23, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit denied Plaintiffs’ Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) petition for permission to appeal the Court’s\nDecember 9, 2009 class certification order.  Before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Second Motion for Class\nCertification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  For the following reasons, the Court grants\nPlaintiffs’ motion.  The Court will not entertain any motions for reconsideration as to this Second Motion for\nClass Certification because the parties have had ample opportunity to make their arguments.  \nBACKGROUND\nIn their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Zaborowski entered the Cook County Jail on June\n3, 2008 and that Jackson entered the Jail on November 23, 2007.  (R. 13-1, Amend. Compl. ¶ 4.)  At the time\nthey entered the Cook County Jail, both Zaborowski and Jackson were pregnant.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  Plaintiffs further\nallege that they were transferred from the Cook County Jail to the Sheriff’s “MOM’s” program, which is an\noff-site, residential treatment program run by the Haymarket Center.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  \n Courtroom Deputy KF\nInitials:\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 1 of  4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 97 Filed: 06/22/10 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:710\n            Zaborowski went into labor on August 29, 2008, and her counselor from the Haymarket Center\ntransported her to Stroger Hospital.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Plaintiffs allege that following Zaborowski’s arrival at Stroger\nHospital, and in accordance with the Sheriff’s alleged policy, deputy sheriffs shackled Zaborowski’s hand and\nfoot to the hospital bed.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  Zaborowski remained shackled hand and foot to the hospital bed for about\neleven hours while she was in labor.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  An armed deputy sheriff remained in the hospital room during that\ntime.  (Id.)  Immediately before giving birth, the attending physician requested that the deputy sheriff unshackle\nZaborowski’s foot.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  The deputy sheriff complied with the doctor’s request and Zaborowski was\nshackled to the bed by one arm when she delivered her child on August 30, 2008.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs further allege\nthat in accordance with the Sheriff’s policy, the deputy sheriff then re-shackled Zaborowski’s foot about an hour\nafter she gave birth.  (Id. ¶ 11.)  Zaborowski remained at Stroger Hospital until the evening of the next day,\nSeptember 1, 2008.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  During this time period, Zaborowski was shackled hand and foot to the hospital\nbed and was not permitted to use the toilet or to get up from the bed to walk.  (Id.)\nAfter Jackson went into labor on May 3, 2008, her counselor from the Haymarket Center took her to\nStroger Hospital.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Following her arrival at Stroger Hospital, and in accordance with the Sheriff’s\nalleged policy, deputy sheriffs shackled Jackson’s hand and foot to the hospital bed.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Jackson remained\nshackled hand and foot while she was in labor and during birth.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  An armed deputy sheriff remained in\nthe hospital room while she was in labor and delivered her child.  (Id.)  Jackson remained at Stroger Hospital for\napproximately four days during which Jackson was shackled hand and foot to the hospital bed and was not\npermitted to use the toilet or to get up from the bed to walk per the Sheriff’s policies.  (Id. ¶ 16.)\nIn the present motion for class certification, Plaintiffs seek to certify the following class:  “All women in\nthe custody of defendant Sheriff on and after December 4, 2006 who have been or who will be shackled during\nlabor, delivery, or recovery following delivery.”  (R. 76-1, Mot. Class Cert., at 1.)   Plaintiffs’ counsel further\nexplains that they were mistaken in their belief that each class member should receive a separate damages\ndetermination as counsel argued in the first class certification motion.  (Id. at 2.)  Instead, Plaintiffs seek class\ncertification to adjudicate both liability and damages for all class members.  (R. 75-1, Pls.’ Mem., at 2.)  To\nclarify, one of the Court’s concerns when denying Plaintiffs’ first class certification motion was the named\nPlaintiffs’ conflicts in representing the putative class members if the Court were to allow approximately 50\nsubsequent lawsuits to determine each class member’s damages.  Plaintiffs now maintain that the damages in\neach case can be established through several separate proceedings in the instant lawsuit or through settlement. \n(Id. at 10.)\nLEGAL STANDARD\nAs the Supreme Court recently explained, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 “[b]y its terms [] creates a\ncategorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class action.” \nShady Grove Orthopedic Assoc., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 130 S.Ct. 1431, 1437 (2010).  “[T]he primary purposes\nof the class-action mechanism” are “judicial economy and efficiency.”  Andrews v. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d\n570, 577 (7th Cir. 2008).  To that end, Rule 23(a) states that “[o]ne or more members of a class may sue or be\nsued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); see also Harper v. Sheriff of Cook\nCounty, 581 F.3d 511, 513 (7th Cir. 2009).  Failure to meet any of these Rule 23(a) requirements precludes class\ncertification.  See Harper, 581 F.3d at 513; Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 797 (7th Cir. 2008).\nIn addition to satisfying the requirements under Rule 23(a), a party seeking class certification must also\nestablish that the proposed class satisfies one of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(b).  See Amchem Prods.,\n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 2 of  4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 97 Filed: 06/22/10 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:711\nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997); Arreola, 546 F.3d at 794.  Here,\nPlaintiffs request certification of the proposed class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), which applies when “the questions\nof law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\nthe controversy.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); see also Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 615-16. \nThe party seeking class certification has the burden of establishing that certification is proper.  See\nOshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 513 (7th Cir. 2006).  In determining whether a party has carried that\nburden, a court need not accept all of the complaint’s allegations as true.  See Szabo v. Bridgeport Mach., Inc.,\n249 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 2001).  Instead, in deciding whether to certify a class, the Court “should make\nwhatever factual and legal inquiries [that] are necessary under Rule 23.”  Id. at 676; see also General Tel. Co. of\nSw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982) (courts may “probe behind the\npleadings before coming to rest on the certification question”).\nANALYSIS\nIn the December 9, 2009 order, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs fulfilled the numerosity, commonality,\nand typicality requirements under Rule 23(a)(1)-(3).  Plaintiffs’ new motion for class certification does not\nchange the Court’s analysis as to these three requirements.  In addition, Plaintiffs’ new proposal eliminates the\nprevious conflict of interest concerns under the adequacy requirement pursuant to Rule 23(a)(4).1  Thus, the Court\nturns to the superiority and predominance requirements under Rule 23(b)(3).  \nUnder Rule 23(b)(3), the Court must determine if (1) the questions of law or fact common to the class\nmembers predominate over questions affecting only the individual class members, and (2) a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods of adjudicating plaintiffs’ claims.  See Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 615;\nAndrews, 545 F.3d at 577.  Rule 23(b)(3) includes a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider regarding\nthe predominance and superiority criteria:\n(A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of\nseparate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already\ncommenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of\nconcentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be\nencountered in the management of a class action.\nAmchem Prods, Inc., 521 U.S. at 615-16; see also Szabo, 249 F.3d at 676 (“Questions such as these require the\nexercise of judgment and the application of sound discretion”).\nI. Predominance\nRule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement “tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to\nwarrant adjudication by representation.”  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623.  Although the predominance requirement is\nsimilar to Rule 23(a)’s typicality and commonality requirements – which Plaintiffs have fulfilled – it is more\ndemanding.  See id. at 623-24; Puffer v. Allstate Ins. Co., 255 F.R.D. 450, 471 (N.D. Ill. 2009).  To clarify, if a\n1  The Court rejects Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ counsel are not sufficiently\ncompetent to manage this class action as baseless.  In the context of counsels’ conduct in\nconnection with the May 11, 2010 settlement conference, Defendants’ motion for attorney’s fees\nis in front of Magistrate Judge Valdez.  (R. 82-1.) \n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al. Page 3 of  4\n\nCase: 1:08-cv-06946 Document #: 97 Filed: 06/22/10 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:712\nputative class challenges a uniform policy, the policy’s validity tends to be the predominant issue in the litigation. \nSee Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159 n. 15; CE Design Ltd. v. Cy’s Crabhouse North, Inc., 259 F.R.D. 135, 142 (N.D. Ill.\n2009); see also Cicilline v. Jewel Food Stores, Inc., 542 F.Supp.2d 831, 838 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (“Class certification\nis usually considered a superior method of adjudicating claims involving standardized conduct, even if there are\nindividual issues that exist among class members”).\nAlthough Plaintiffs are challenging the Sheriff’s uniform shackling policy, Defendants nevertheless argue\nthat there is a need for individualized proof based on the duration of each plaintiff’s restraint, the different ways\nplaintiffs were restrained, and the time period of the restraint.  First, “the need for individual proof alone does not\nnecessarily preclude class certification.”  Pella Corp. v. Saltzman, ___ F.3d ___, 2010 WL 1994653, at *3 (7th\nCir. May 20, 2010) (per curiam).  Second, Defendants’ arguments go to damages and causation issues and not the\nunderlying question of liability, namely, whether the Sheriff’s shackling policy is unconstitutional.  If – later in\nthe proceedings – the Court determines that this liability question involves individualized determinations,\nDefendants may move to de-certify the class.  At this stage of the proceedings, however, Plaintiffs have satisfied\nthe requirement that Plaintiffs and the putative class members share common questions of law making class-wide\nadjudication efficient compared to repetitive individual litigation on the same liability question.  See Lemon v.\nInternational Union of Operating Eng’rs, 216 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir. 2000).\nII. Superiority\nWhen considering whether a class action would be superior to other forms of adjudication, a central\nquestion is that of manageability.  See Williams v. Chartwell Fin. Servs., Ltd., 204 F.3d 748, 760 (7th Cir. 2000). \n“[T]his consideration encompasses the whole range of practical problems that may render the class action format\ninappropriate for a particular suit.” Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 164, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d\n732 (1974).  \nHere, the obvious manageability problem is the question of the class member’s individual damages.  As\nthe Seventh Circuit teaches, Rule 23 allows courts to devise solutions to individual damages issues, including\nappointing a magistrate judge to preside over the damages proceedings, creating subclasses, or decertifying the\nclass after the Court resolves liability issues.  See Arreola, 546 F.3d at 801; Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376\nF.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004).  Also, there is a possibility that the parties may negotiate a settlement as to the\nindividual plaintiff’s damages.  See Carnegie, 376 F.3d at 661.  Accordingly, the Court’s initial manageability\nconcerns pertaining to the 50 subsequent lawsuits are no longer at issue, especially in light of Plaintiffs’ proposal\nthat only a handful of damages proceedings will be necessary.  See Cicilline, 542 F.Supp.2d at 838. \nMeanwhile, Defendants’ argument that the class action is not superior because the potential damages are\nnot nominal is without merit because Rule 23(b)(3) does not exclude cases in which individual damages may run\nhigh.  See Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 617.   Indeed, if “a few class members’ injuries prove to be substantial,\nthey may opt out and litigate independently.”  Murray v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 434 F.3d 948, 953 (7th Cir.\n2006).  Thus, the fact that Plaintiffs’ damages may be more than nominal, alone, does not defeat Plaintiffs’ class\ncertification motion.\nFinally, Defendants take umbrage with the fact that after the Court denied Plaintiffs’ class certification\nmotion on December 9, 2009, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed additional lawsuits challenging the Sheriff’s shackling\npolicy on behalf of other plaintiffs.  Counsels’ filing of these additional lawsuits was based on statute of\nlimitations concerns.  See Vitiritti v. Dart, No. 09 C 7792, 2010 WL 1418578, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 6, 2010)\n(statute of limitations tolls class action lawsuit from filing date through date class certification denied). \nTherefore, Defendants’ argument based on these additional lawsuits is unavailing, especially because these\nplaintiffs are now class members in the present lawsuit.  \n08C6946 Zaborowski et al vs. Sheriff of Cook County et al.
