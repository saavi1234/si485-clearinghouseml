    "summary": "<p>On January 20, 2010, an employee of the federal judiciary married to her same-sex partner under California law filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2201-2202, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 701-706, against the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Lambda Legal, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief and a review of administrative action, alleging an equal protection violation. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the Fifth Amendment by refusing to recognize lawful same-sex marriages for purposes of the laws governing spousal health benefits for federal employees, thereby denying her of a benefit that would be available to her if her spouse were of the opposite sex.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff, a 19-year employee of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, had applied for health benefits for her wife and been denied, and though the Ninth Circuit (Chief Judge Alex Kozinski) then issued an order as part of the employment dispute procedure finding that she was entitled to spousal health benefits, In re Golinski, 587 F.3d 901 (9th Cir. 2009), the OPM had refused to comply. As such, the plaintiff's initial complaint requested a writ of mandamus to enforce the Ninth Circuit order. On March 16, 2011, however, the District Court (Judge Jeffrey S. White) dismissed this claim, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to issue mandamus relief, Golinski v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 781 F. Supp. 2d 967 (N.D. Cal. 2011), and the plaintiff was forced to amend her complaint to request injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on February 23, 2011, the Department of Justice indicated that it had come to the conclusion that DOMA was unconstitutional and that it would no longer defend the act in court. In response to this, on May 4, 2011, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives (BLAG) moved to intervene to defend the act, and their motion was granted on June 3. On the same day, the defendants-intervenors moved to dismiss the complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment, and the Department of Justice filed a brief supporting the plaintiff's claim.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2012, the District Court (Judge White) granted the plaintiff's motion and denied that of the defendant-intervenors. Golinski v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 824 F. Supp. 2d 968 (N.D. Cal. 2012). The Court stated that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subjected to heightened scrutiny, but held that the application of DOMA to deny spousal health benefits in this case did not even have a rational basis and thus constituted a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. It entered a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from interfering with the enrollment of the plaintiff's wife in her family health benefits plan.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants-intervenors appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On May 22, 2012, the Court of Appeals (Judge Sydney R. Thomas) denied the plaintiff's motion for an initial hearing en banc and scheduled arguments before a three-judge panel for the week of September 10-14. However, the Court vacated the September 10, 2012 oral argument date, pending the resolution of the petition for writ of certiorari submitted to the Supreme Court on July 3, 2012 by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States entered an order denying the petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit entered an order dismissing all appeals of the case, as stipulated by the parties following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States v. Windsor</a> holding &sect; 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.</p>",

On July 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a petition in the Supreme Court for certiorari prior to judgment.   That petition was held without decision while the Court considered the California Prop. 8 case and Windsor, the DOMA case from the Second Circuit, in which the Court granted review on December 7. The case was dismissed following the decision in Windsor holding § 3 of DOMA unconstitutional.",

After a \nthorough  review  of  the  undisputed  facts  and \nprecedent, the district court concluded that it is not.  \nPet.  App.  59a  (“DOMA  unconstitutionally \ndiscriminates against same-sex couples.”). \n \nThe  case  arose  after  Ms.  Golinski,  a  Staff \nAttorney with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for \nmore than 20 years, was denied health coverage for \nher spouse Amy Cunninghis, to whom she is lawfully \nmarried under California law.  Pet. App. 2a; Strauss \nv. Horton, 207 P.3d 48, 122 (2009).  They have been a \ncommitted  couple  for  more  than  22  years  and  are \nraising  their  nine-year-old  son  together.   See Pet. \nApp. 2a.  Solely because of DOMA, Ms. Golinski was \ndenied  the  same  spousal  health  coverage  that  her \nheterosexual, married colleagues are able to take for \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \ngranted,  even  though  Ms.  Golinski  has  proudly \nprovided the same valuable public service for more \nthan two decades.  See Pet. App. 14a-15a. \n \nSection 3 of DOMA was adopted by 110 Stat. \n2419 and sweepingly provides that “In determining \nthe meaning of any Act of Congress, or any ruling, \nregulation,  or  interpretation  of  the  various \nadministrative bureaus and agencies of the United \nStates, the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union \nbetween one man and one woman as husband and \nwife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of \nthe opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.”  \n  \nSection 3 of DOMA excludes state-sanctioned \nmarriages  of  same-sex  couples  from  recognition  by \nthe federal government for all purposes.  In doing so, \nit  causes  grievous  harms  to  tens  of  thousands  of \nmarried  same-sex  couples  and  their  families.   See \nU.S.  Census  Bureau,  Census  Bureau  Releases \nEstimates of Same-Sex Married Couples  (Sept.  27, \n2011), http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/ \narchives/2010_census/cb11-cn181.html;  Pet.  3-4 \n(noting  that  the  statute  excludes  the  marriages  of \nsame-sex  couples  from  recognition  “for  purposes  of \nmore  than  1000  federal  statutes  and  programs”).  \nDelay in conclusively resolving the constitutionality \nof Section 3 of DOMA perpetuates and compounds \nsuch serious harms.  Delay also burdens and creates \nuncertainty  for  state  and  local  governments, \nbusinesses,  and  other  third  parties  who  currently \nmust treat same-sex couples as married for purposes \nof state law but not married for purposes of federal \nlaw.  Because the Executive Branch has concluded \nthat Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional, but has \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \ndetermined that it should continue to comply with \nthat  law  until  a  “definitive”  decision  is  reached \nregarding its constitutionality, see Pet. 5-6, delay in \nthe authoritative resolution of this issue is all the \nmore intolerable.  This issue therefore calls out for \nprompt issuance of such a “definitive” decision.   \n \nThe instant case is a particularly compelling \ncase for consideration of whether Section 3 of DOMA \nis  constitutional.    As  the  District  Court  explained, \n“The pertinent facts are not in dispute.”  Pet. App. \n2a.     \n \nThis case does not present any legal issue that \nmight impede this Court from determining whether \nSection 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional.  While Ms. \nGolinski  previously  raised  in  the  district  court  a \nmandamus  claim  and  a  statutory  claim  under  the \nFederal  Health  Benefits  Act  of  1959,  she  did  not \nappeal dismissal of those claims by the district court \nand did not pursue these claims in her Ninth Circuit \nanswering  brief.    See  Plaintiff-Appellee’s  Brief, \nGolinski v. Office of Personnel Management, et al. \n(July 3, 2012) (No. 12-15388, Docket No. 85).  Those \nclaims  therefore  have  been  waived.   See Fields v. \nPalmdale Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 1197, 1203 n.6 (9th \nCir. 2005).  Even were that not the case, Ms. Golinski \nhereby abandons any such claims before this Court.  \nAdditionally, this case was properly appealed to the \nNinth  Circuit  because  Ms.  Golinski  has  neither \npursued nor received damages in this action.  Thus, \nthe  sole  issue  on  appeal  is  whether  Section  3  of \nDOMA is unconstitutional.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nIn  addition,  as  explained  in  the  Solicitor \nGeneral’s Petition, Pet. 13, in this case, the district \ncourt fully analyzed the considerations this Court has \nidentified as relevant to determining the important \npredicate  question  of  what  level  of  scrutiny  the \njudiciary should apply to laws like DOMA’s Section 3 \nthat discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. \nPet. App. 17a-20a, 25a-34a.  This Court has never \nresolved this issue.  See Pet. App. 24a (noting that, in \nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632-33 (1996), this \nCourt found it unnecessary to look beyond rational \nbasis  review  to  hold  that  Colorado’s  state \nconstitutional amendment barring antidiscrimination \nprotections  for  lesbians,  gay  men,  and  bisexuals \nviolated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal \nprotection of the laws). \n \nThe district court carefully considered expert \ntestimony  and  precedent  establishing  the  long \nhistory of invidious discrimination against lesbians \nand  gay  men,  the  lack  of  relevance  of  a  person’s \nsexual  orientation  to  the  ability  to  contribute  to \nsociety, and—although of less weight in determining \nthe applicable level of scrutiny—the ways in which \nsexual orientation is a core, defining, and immutable \ntrait,  as  well  as  the  political  vulnerability  of  the \nlesbian and gay minority in our country.  The district \ncourt’s factual findings, framing of the analysis, and \nthorough consideration of this initial question make \nthis  a  particularly  appropriate  case  in  which  to \nconsider the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA.   \n \nMoreover,  having  determined  that \ngovernmental  discrimination  based  on  sexual \norientation  should  receive  heightened  judicial \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nscrutiny  pursuant  to  the  analysis  established  by \ncontrolling  Supreme  Court  precedent,  the  district \ncourt analyzed whether Section 3 of DOMA could be \njustified under either heightened scrutiny or rational \nbasis  review,  thoughtfully  evaluating  the  expert \ntestimony  and  legal  authority  relevant  to  both \nstandards  of  review.    Pet.  App.  34a-44a,  47a-59a.  \nThe  district  court’s  factual  findings  and  thorough \nconsideration of whether Section 3 of DOMA can be \njustified  under  any  applicable  level  of  scrutiny \nfurther make this case an especially helpful one in \nwhich to review Section 3’s constitutionality. \n \nThe significance of this case is testified to by \nthe more than twenty amicus briefs submitted to the \nNinth  Circuit  on  all  sides  of  the  issue  by,  among \nothers, the State of California; fourteen other states; \nten  senators;  132  members  of  the  House  of \nRepresentatives; numerous cities, including Boston, \nLos Angeles, New York, and Seattle; key medical and \nsocial  science  organizations  such  as  the  American \nPsychological  Association,  the  American  Medical \nAssociation,  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics, \nand  the  National  Association  of  Social  Workers; \nscores of pre-eminent historians and law professors; \nleading  businesses,  unions,  law  firms,  professional \nand  trade  organizations,  and  religious  groups;  and \ndozens  of  the  nation’s  top  civil  rights  advocacy \norganizations. \n \nMs.  Golinski  accordingly  agrees  with  the \nSolicitor General that this case is one in which the \nCourt should exercise its power to grant a writ of \ncertiorari  before  judgment  “[b]ecause  the  issues \npresented here are of great significance and demand \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nprompt resolution.”  Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 \nU.S. 654, 668 (1981); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1) \n(noting that this Court may grant a writ of certiorari \n“upon  the  petition  of  any  party  …  before  or  after \nrendition  of  judgment”);  28  U.S.C.  §  2101(e)  (“An \napplication  to  the  Supreme  Court  for  a  writ  of \ncertiorari to review a case before judgment may be \nmade at any time before judgment.”); S. Ct. R. 11 (a \npetition for writ of certiorari before judgment may be \ngranted  “upon  a  showing  that  the  case  is  of  such \nimperative public importance as to justify deviation \nfrom  normal  appellate  practice  and  to  require \nimmediate determination by this Court”).  The Ninth \nCircuit constitutes the largest circuit in this nation in \nboth  geography  and  population,  and  there  are \ncountless other married same-sex couples awaiting a \nfinal determination in Ms. Golinski’s case.  This is \none of the exceptional situations in which the grant \nof a petition for certiorari before judgment is clearly \nwarranted  in  order  to  provide  a  swift  and  certain \nanswer  to  a  question  of  imperative  public \nimportance,  which  the  question  of  the \nconstitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA assuredly is \nand which this case optimally presents.  \n \nThis Court has on numerous occasions invoked \nits  power  to  grant  a  petition  for  certiorari  before \njudgment to obtain prompt and final resolution of the \nconstitutionality of an Act of Congress of broad or \npressing concern like Section 3 of DOMA.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 229 (2005) \n(constitutionality of provisions of Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, \n362,  371  (1989)  (constitutionality  of  Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984); Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 5 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n(1957)  (constitutionality  of  expansion  of  military \njurisdiction over civilians under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice); R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Alton R.R. Co., 295 \nU.S.  330,  344  (1935)  (constitutionality  of  Railroad \nRetirement Act); Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. \nCo.,  294  U.S.  240,  295  (1935)  (constitutionality  of \ncongressional power and control over the monetary \nsystem under the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933). \n \nCases  involving  acute  national  issues \nregarding  the  civil  rights  of  minorities,  like  the \npresent  case,  also  have  been  recognized  as \nparticularly  fitting  for  exercise  of  the  Court’s \nauthority to grant certiorari before judgment under \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1254(1) and 2101(e) and Supreme Court \nRule  11  in  order  to  obtain  swift  and  definitive \nresolution by this Court.  This has been especially \ntrue where other cases are pending before the Court \nraising  the  same  constitutional  issue  or  issues  in \nother contexts, as is the case here where petitions for \ncertiorari were pending in Bipartisan Legal Advisory \nGroup of the House of Representatives v. Gill, No. 12-\n13  (filed  June  29,  2012),  and  Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs. v. Massachusetts, No. 12-15 (filed July \n3, 2012) at the time the Solicitor General filed the \npetition for certiorari before judgment in the instant \ncase.  See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 259-\n60 (2003) (noting decision to hear and decide prior to \njudgment  in  Grutter v. Bollinger,  539  U.S.  306 \n(2003), as well); Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 344 U.S. 1, 3 \n(1952) (inviting filing of petition for certiorari before \njudgment  in Bolling v. Sharpe,  347  U.S.  497,  498 \n(1954)).   \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nIn sum, this case clearly meets the criteria for \ngranting  a  petition  for  certiorari  before  judgment.  \nThe legal issue raised has far-reaching consequences \nthat it is important to have authoritatively resolved \nas soon as possible.  Furthermore, the district court’s \ndecision  presents  that  issue  in  a  clear  and \ncomprehensive manner, including determining both \nthe appropriate level of scrutiny and whether Section \n3  of  DOMA  can  be  justified  under  any  level  of \nscrutiny.   \n       \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, Ms. Golinski \nacquiesces  in  the  Petition  for  a  Writ  of  Certiorari \nBefore Judgment in this case and supports it being \ngranted. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJON W.

The \nDepartment of Justice argued, and the district court \nagreed, that DOMA violates equal protection.  The \nDepartment now seeks certiorari before judgment in \nthe Court of Appeals.   \nThe questions presented are: \n(1)  Does  Section  3  of  DOMA  violate  the  equal \nprotection component of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment?  \n(2)  Petitioners  are  a  federal  agency  and  officer \nwho  do  not  have  general  responsibility  for \nadministering DOMA, but merely oversee a limited \nnumber of its applications.  When such agencies or \nofficers  argue  that  a  federal  statute  is \nunconstitutional and prevail in the lower courts, and \nwhere the House of Representatives has intervened \nto defend the statute, do the agencies and officers \nhave prudential standing to seek this Court’s review \nof the judgment they requested? \n   \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nRespondent the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group \nof the U.S. House of Representatives (“House”) was \nthe intervenor-defendant in the district court and is \nan appellant in the Ninth Circuit.1  The Department \nof Justice’s statement in its Petition on behalf of the \nExecutive  Branch  defendants  that  the  House \nintervened merely “to present arguments” in favor of \nDOMA,  see  Pet.  (II),  is  inaccurate.    Although  the \nDepartment  argued  in  the  district  court  that  the \nHouse’s  intervention  should  be  limited  to  those \nterms,  the  district  court  granted  the  House \nintervention as a “party-defendant” to fully litigate \nDOMA’s  constitutionality  under  equal  protection \nprinciples.  App. 7a.   \n                                            \n1 The United States House of Representatives has articulated \nits institutional position in litigation matters through a five-\nmember bipartisan leadership group since at least the early \n1980’s  (although  the  formulation  of  the  group’s  name  has \nchanged somewhat over time).  Since 1993, the House rules \nhave  formally  acknowledged  and  referred  to  the  Bipartisan \nLegal Advisory Group, as such, in connection with its function \nof providing direction to the Office of the General Counsel.  See, \ne.g., Rule I.11, Rules of the House of Representatives, 103rd \nCong. (1993); Rule II.8, Rules of the House of Representatives, \n112th  Cong.  (2011).    While  the  group  seeks  consensus \nwhenever possible, it functions on a majoritarian basis, like the \ninstitution it represents, when consensus cannot be achieved.  \nThe Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group currently is comprised of \nthe Honorable John A. Boehner, Speaker of the House, the \nHonorable Eric Cantor, Majority Leader, the Honorable Kevin \nMcCarthy,  Majority  Whip,  the  Honorable  Nancy  Pelosi, \nDemocratic  Leader,  and  the  Honorable  Steny  H.  Hoyer, \nDemocratic Whip.

Massachusetts  \n(July 3, 2012) ......................................................... 16 \n  \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe House respectfully opposes the Petition for a \nWrit of Certiorari Before Judgment filed in this case \n(“Petition”).    The  important  issue  of  the \nconstitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA is squarely \npresented to this Court in the earlier-filed Petition \nafter  judgment  in  No.  12-13,  Bipartisan  Legal \nAdvisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives \nv. Gill.  That Petition comes in the ordinary course \nfollowing the judgment and opinion of the Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit.  There is no reason to \ntake  the  extraordinary  step  of  granting  certiorari \nbefore judgment here when the exact same issue is \npresented in a pending petition for certiorari after \njudgment.    That  is  particularly  true  in  this  case, \nwhere it is the prevailing party in the district court \nthat seeks to invoke this Court’s review and the case \nis in other respects a less attractive vehicle for this \nCourt’s review. \nGranting this extraordinary Petition for certiorari \nbefore judgment would accomplish nothing beyond \nneedlessly complicating this Court’s review on the \nmerits.  The Department of Justice (“Department”) \nprevailed in both the district court in this case and \nin the decision and judgment of the First Circuit in \nGill.    There  is  certainly  no  reason  for  the \nDepartment  to  get  the  benefit  of  an  opening  and \nreply  brief  in  both  cases,  and  even  less  reason  to \nhave  different  briefing  schedules  in  the  two  cases \nsuch that those defending DOMA would file first in \nGill while the Department files first here.  Thus, if \nthis  Court  were  to  grant  the  Petition  here,  to \npreserve the proper alignment of the parties it would \nhave  to  undo  the  effect  of  that  decision  to  grant \n\n2 \ncertiorari  to  the  Department  by  realigning  the \nparties and setting a unique briefing schedule that \nproperly provides an opening and reply brief to the \nHouse.    There  is  no  need  for  any  of  that.    The \nstraightforward course here is also the correct one:  \nThis Court should grant the House’s Petition in No. \n12-13  to  review  the  decision  and  judgment  of  the \nFirst  Circuit  and  deny  this  request  for  certiorari \nbefore judgment.2  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n1.  The Defense of Marriage Act \nThe Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 “was enacted \nwith strong majorities in both Houses [of Congress] \nand  signed  into  law  by  President  Clinton.”  \nMassachusetts v. U.S. Dep’t of HHS, 682 F.3d 1, 6 \n(1st Cir. 2012).  The House of Representatives voted \n342-67 to enact DOMA, and the Senate voted 85-14 \nto  do  so.    See  142  Cong.  Rec.  17093-94  (1996) \n(House); id. at 22467 (Senate).   \nSection 3 of DOMA defines “marriage” as the legal \nunion of one man and one woman and “spouse” as a \nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife. \n1 U.S.C. § 7.  These definitions apply for purposes of \nfederal law only.  DOMA does not bar or invalidate \nany  state-law  marriage,  but  leaves  states  free  to \ndecide  whether  they  will  recognize  same-sex \nmarriage.   Section 3  of  DOMA  simply  asserts  the \nfederal government’s right as a separate sovereign to \n                                            \n2 For the same and additional reasons, the Court should also \ndeny the other premature petitions, see infra pp. 13-14, and the \nDepartment’s  unnecessary  Petition  in  No.  12-15.    See  the \nHouse’s Br. in Opp., No. 12-15 (Aug. 31, 2012). \n\n3 \nprovide  its  own  definition  for  purposes  of  federal \nprograms and funding. \nWhile  Congress  was  considering  DOMA,  it \nrequested the opinion of the Department on the bill’s \nconstitutionality,  and  the  Department  three  times \nreassured  Congress  by  letter  that  DOMA  was \nconstitutional.  See Letters from Andrew Fois, Asst. \nAtt’y Gen., to Rep. Canady (May 29, 1996), reprinted \nin  H.R.  Rep.  No.  104-664,  34  (1996),  reprinted  in \n1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2905 (“House Rep.”); to Rep. Hyde \n(May 14, 1996), reprinted in House Rep. 33-34; and \nto  Sen.  Hatch  (July  9,  1996),  reprinted  in  The \nDefense of Marriage Act: Hearing on S. 1740 Before \nthe S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 2 (1996) \n(“Senate  Hrg.”).    Congress  also  received  and \nconsidered  other  expert  advice  on  DOMA’s \nconstitutionality  and  determined  that  DOMA  is \nconstitutional.  E.g., House Rep. 33 (DOMA “plainly \nconstitutional”); Defense of Marriage Act: Hearing on \nH.R. 3396 Before the Subcomm. on the Constitution \nof the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 87-\n117  (1996)  (testimony  of  Professor  Hadley  Arkes); \nSenate  Hrg.  1,  2  (Sen.  Hatch)  (DOMA  “is  a \nconstitutional piece of legislation” and “a legitimate \nexercise of Congress’ power”); id. at 23-41 (testimony \nof  Professor  Lynn  D.  Wardle);  id.  at  56-59  (letter \nfrom Professor Michael W. McConnell). \nCongress, of course, did not invent the meanings of \nthe words “marriage” and “spouse” when it enacted \nDOMA in 1996.  Instead, it adopted the traditional \ndefinitions of those terms.  Nor was the timing of \nCongress’  decision  a  fortuity.    Instead,  Congress \nacted to ensure that Hawaii’s novel and then-recent \ndecision to take steps toward redefining marriage, \n\n4 \nsee Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993), did not \nautomatically  dictate  the  definition  in  other \njurisdictions.  Thus, Section 2 of DOMA allowed each \nstate  to  decide  whether  to  retain  the  traditional \ndefinition  without  having  another  jurisdiction’s \ndecision imposed via full faith and credit principles, \nand  Section  3  preserved  the  federal  government’s \nability to retain the traditional definition for federal \nlaw  purposes.    Moreover,  pre-1996  Congresses \ndecidedly did not regard themselves as powerless to \ndefine  marriage  for  purposes  of  federal  law.  \nAlthough  Congress  often  has  made  eligibility  for \nfederal marital benefits or duties turn on a couple’s \nstate-law marital status, it also has a long history of \nsupplying  federal  marital  definitions  in  various \ncontexts—definitions  that  always  have  been \ncontrolling  for  purposes  of  federal  law,  without \nregard  to  the  couple’s  status  under  state  law.3  \nIndeed, in clarifying the meanings of “marriage” and \n“spouse” in federal law by enacting DOMA, Congress \nmerely reaffirmed what it has always meant when \n                                            \n3 See, e.g., I.R.C. § 2(b)(2) (deeming persons unmarried who \nare legally separated from their spouse or whose spouse is a \nnonresident  alien);  I.R.C.  § 7703(b)  (excluding  some  couples \n“living  apart”  from  federal  marriage  definition  for  tax \npurposes);  38  U.S.C.  § 101(31)  (for  purposes  of  veterans’ \nbenefits,  “’spouse’  means  a  person of  the  opposite  sex”);  42 \nU.S.C.  § 416  (defining  “spouse,”  “wife,”  “husband,”  “widow,” \n“widower,”  and  “divorce,”  for  social-security  purposes);  42 \nU.S.C.  § 1382c(d)(2)  (recognizing  common-law  marriage  for \npurposes  of  social  security  benefits  without  regard  to  state \nrecognition); 5 U.S.C. §§ 8101(6), (11), 8341(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A) \n(federal  employee-benefits  statutes);  8  U.S.C.  § 1186a(b)(1) \n(anti-fraud  criteria  regarding  marriage  in  immigration  law \ncontext). \n\n5 \nusing those words in federal law—and what courts \nand the Executive Branch have always understood it \nto mean:  A traditional male-female couple.4   \n2.  The Justice Department’s About-Face and \nthe House’s Intervention \nAfter  DOMA’s  enactment,  discharging  the \nExecutive’s  constitutional  duty  to  “take  Care  that \nthe Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. art. II, \n§ 3, the Department during the Bush Administration \nsuccessfully  defended  DOMA  against  several \nconstitutional challenges, prevailing in every case to \nreach final judgment.5  The Department continued to \n                                            \n4 See, e.g., Revenue Act of 1921, § 223(b)(2), 42 Stat. 227, 250 \n(permitting “a husband and wife living together” to file a joint \ntax return; cf. I.R.C. § 6013(a) (“A husband and wife may make \na  single  return  jointly  of  income  taxes”));  Veterans  and \nSurvivors Pension Interim Adjustment Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. \n94-169, Title I, § 101(31), 89 Stat. 1013, codified at 38 U.S.C. \n§ 101(31) (“The term ‘spouse’ means a person of the opposite \nsex”); U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Final Rule, The Family and Medical \nLeave Act of 1993, 60 Fed. Reg. 2,180, 2,190-91 (Jan. 6, 1995) \n(rejecting, as inconsistent with congressional intent, proposed \ndefinition  of  “spouse”  that  would  have  included  “same-sex \nrelationships”); Adams v. Howerton, 486 F. Supp. 1119, 1123 \n(C.D. Cal. 1980) (“Congress, as a matter of federal law, did not \nintend that a person of one sex could be a ‘spouse’ to a person of \nthe same sex for immigration law purposes.”), aff’d, 673 F.2d \n1036 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1111 (1982); Dean v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307, 314 (D.C. 1995) (Congress, \nin enacting the District of Columbia’s marriage statute of 1901, \nintended “that ‘marriage’ is limited to opposite-sex couples”). \n5 See Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp. 2d 1298 (M.D. Fla. 2005); \nSmelt v. Cnty. of Orange, 374 F. Supp. 2d 861 (C.D. Cal. 2005), \naff’d in part and vacated in part for lack of standing, 447 F.3d \n673 (9th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 959 (2006); Hunt v. \nAke, No. 04-cv-1852 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 20, 2005); Sullivan v. Bush, \nNo. 04-cv-21118 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 16, 2005) (granting voluntary \n\n6 \ndefend  DOMA  during  the  first  two  years  of  the \ncurrent Administration, prevailing in an additional \ndistrict court case in the Ninth Circuit.  See Torres-\nBarragan v. Holder, No. 09-cv-8564 (C.D. Cal. Apr. \n30, 2010).  \nIn  February  2011,  however,  the  Administration \nabruptly  announced  its  intent  to  refuse  to  defend \nDOMA’s  constitutionality.    Letter  from  Att’y  Gen. \nEric H. Holder, Jr., to the Hon. John A. Boehner, \nSpeaker  of  the  House  (Feb.  23,  2011), \nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-\n223.html (“Holder Letter”).  Attorney General Holder \nstated  that  he  and  President  Obama  were  of  the \nview “that a heightened standard [of review] should \napply [to DOMA], that Section 3 is unconstitutional \nunder that standard and that the Department will \ncease defense of Section 3.”  Id. \nThe Attorney General acknowledged that, in light \nof “the respect appropriately due to a coequal branch \nof government,” the Department “has a longstanding \npractice  of  defending  the  constitutionality  of  duly-\nenacted  statutes  if  reasonable  arguments  can  be \nmade in their defense.”  Id.  He did not, however, \napply that standard to DOMA.  On the contrary, he \nconceded  that  every  Circuit  to  consider  the  issue \n(i.e.,  eleven  Circuits)  had  held  that  sexual \norientation classifications are subject only to rational \nbasis  review,  and  he  acknowledged  that  “a \nreasonable argument for Section 3’s constitutionality \nmay  be  proffered  under  [the  rational  basis] \nstandard.”  Id. \n                                                                                         \ndismissal  after  the  Department  moved  to  dismiss);  In  re \nKandu, 315 B.R. 123 (Bankr. W.D. Wash. 2004). \n\n7 \nIn response, the House sought and received leave \nto  intervene  as  a  party-defendant  in  the  various \ncases  nationwide  involving  equal-protection \nchallenges  to  DOMA’s  constitutionality.  \nNotwithstanding  that  the  Holder  Letter  said  only \nthat  the  Department  would  not  defend  DOMA \nSection  3,  the  Department  went  further  and \naffirmatively attacked Section 3 in court and accused \nthe Congress that enacted DOMA—many of whose \nMembers still serve—of doing so out of “animus.”6  \nThe  Department  took  this  position  even  though \nDOMA  was  the  very  same  statute  (i)  that  the \nDepartment  had  defended  a  few  short  months \nbefore, and (ii) that the Department acknowledges is \nconstitutional under the equal protection standard \nthat  applies  in  the  great  majority  of  Circuits, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit (rational basis review). \n3.

Procedural History \nMs. Golinski obtained a marriage license with Amy \nCunninghis,  another  woman,  in  California.  \n                                            \n6 See Br. for OPM, et al., Golinski, Nos. 12-15388 & 12-15409 \n(9th Cir. July 3, 2012).  The Department has filed substantive \nbriefs  in  numerous  other  DOMA  cases  making  this  same \nargument.  See briefs in Windsor v. United States, Nos. 12-2335 \n& 12-2435 (2d Cir. Aug. 10, 2012); Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep’t \nof HHS, Nos. 10-2204, 10-2207, & 10-2214 (1st Cir. Sept. 22, \n2011); Revelis v. Napolitano, No. 1:11-cv-1991 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 23, \n2012); Dragovich v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, No. 4:10-cv-1564 \n(N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2012); Cozen O’Connor, P.C. v. Tobits, No. \n2:11-cv-45 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 30, 2011); Bishop v. United States, No. \n4:04-cv-848 (N.D. Okla. Nov. 18, 2011); Pedersen v. OPM, No. \n3:10-cv-1750 (D. Conn. Sept. 14, 2011); Lui v. Holder, No. 2:11-\ncv-1267 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2011). \n\n8 \nRespondent’s  Br.  in  Supp.  of  Cert.  1.    In  this \nlitigation,  Ms.  Golinski  seeks  federal  health \ninsurance coverage for Ms. Cunninghis based on Ms. \nGolinski’s  employment  as  a  staff  attorney  for  the \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Id. \nThe  litigation  began  as  an  administrative \nproceeding  in  the  Ninth  Circuit  Judicial  Council’s \nemployee dispute resolution program.  Chief Judge \nKozinski,  sitting  in  his  administrative  capacity, \nruled  that  although  Ms.  Cunninghis  could  not  be \nregarded  as  Ms.  Golinski’s  “spouse”  within  the \nmeaning of the relevant statutes, she nevertheless \nwas  entitled  to  benefits  as  a  “member  of  [Ms. \nGolinski’s] family.”  In re Golinski, 587 F.3d 901, 902 \n(9th  Cir.  Jud.  Cncl.  2009).    When  the  Office  of \nPersonnel Management disagreed and continued to \ndeny  Ms.  Cunninghis’  enrollment  in  the  relevant \nhealth coverage plan, Ms. Golinski filed the instant \nsuit  in  the  Northern  District  of  California.    Her \ninitial  complaint  sought  only  mandamus  relief  to \nenforce Judge Kozinski’s administrative order.  The \ndistrict  court  dismissed  this  mandamus  claim, \nconcluding that OPM had no clear non-discretionary \nduty to comply with an administrative order of that \ntype.  See generally Golinski v. OPM, 781 F. Supp. 2d \n967 (N.D. Cal. 2011).     \nIn  so  ruling,  however,  the  district  court \ngratuitously expressed its “clear and resolute * * * \ncondemnation of” DOMA as “a discriminatory rule of \nlaw.”    Id.  at  971.    The  court  further  said  that  it \n“would, if it could, address the constitutionality of \n* * *  the  legislative  decision  to  enact  Section  3  of \nDOMA to unfairly restrict benefits and privileges to \nstate-sanctioned same-sex marriages,” and granted \n\n9 \nMs. Golinski “leave to amend to attempt to plead a \n[constitutional] claim.”  Id. at 975.   \nMs.  Golinski  accepted  this  extraordinary  judicial \ninvitation and amended her complaint to challenge \nSection 3 on equal protection grounds, as well as re-\nasserting her statutory claim.  After the Department \nnotified the Court that it would not defend against \nthese  claims,  the  House  then  sought,  and  was \ngranted, leave to intervene as a party-defendant to \ndefend  DOMA’s  constitutionality  under  equal \nprotection.  Order, Golinski, No. 10-cv-257 (N.D. Cal. \nJune 3, 2011).  Contrary to Petitioners’ suggestion \nthat  the  House  intervened  merely  to  “present \narguments in defense” or to “present a defense” of \nDOMA Section 3, Pet. (II), 6; see also Pet. 7, 10 & \nn.4,  the  district  court  expressly  stated  that  the \nHouse “intervene[d] as a party-defendant,” App. 7a, \nand the House has participated as a party in this \ncase. \nThe House moved to dismiss.  The Department also \nfiled  a  document  styled  a  motion  to  dismiss,  but, \nwith respect to DOMA’s constitutionality, the motion \nwas pro forma only.  Mot. to Dismiss, Golinski (N.D. \nCal.  June  3,  2011).    Far  from  actually  seeking \ndismissal, the Department filed an “opposition” to its \nown motion to dismiss as well as the House’s motion, \narguing that DOMA is unconstitutional and that the \ndistrict court “should deny the motions to dismiss.”  \nDefs.’ Br. in Opp. to Mots. to Dismiss 24, Golinski \n(N.D. Cal. July 1, 2011). \nIn its filing, the Department acknowledged that its \nheightened-scrutiny  theory  was  foreclosed  by \n“binding  authority  of  this  circuit  hold[ing]  that \nrational basis  review  applies  to  sexual  orientation \n\n10 \nclassifications,”  but  maintained  that  these  Ninth \nCircuit precedents were “incorrect.”  Id. at vi. \nb.  The District Court’s Opinion \nThe  district  court—making  good  on  its  earlier \npromise—agreed with the Department and held that \nDOMA  is  subject  to  heightened  scrutiny  and  is \nunconstitutional under that standard.  App. 18a-44a.  \nAlthough  the  House  and  the  Department  both \nagreed  that  the  district  court  was  bound  by  the \nNinth Circuit’s “hold[ing] that homosexuals do not \nconstitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to \ngreater than rational basis scrutiny under the equal \nprotection component of the Due Process Clause of \nthe  Fifth  Amendment,”  High  Tech  Gays  v.  Def. \nIndus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 574 (9th \nCir. 1990), the district court described this holding \nas “outdated” and abrogated by this Court’s decision \nin Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), App. 23a, \nnotwithstanding  the  Ninth  Circuit’s  earlier \nconclusion  that  its  precedents  holding  that  sexual \norientation  classifications  are  not  subject  to \nheightened  equal  protection  scrutiny  “w[ere]  not \ndisturbed  by  Lawrence,  which  declined  to  address \nequal protection.”  Witt v. Dep’t of Air Force, 527 F.3d \n806, 821 (9th Cir. 2008).  \nHaving  side-stepped  circuit  precedent  calling  for \nrational basis review, the district court then found \nheightened  scrutiny  appropriate  under  the  factors \nidentified  by  this  Court  as  relevant  to  whether  a \nclassification  should  be  treated  as  suspect.    App. \n25a-34a.    The  district  court  therefore  invalidated \nDOMA under heightened scrutiny.   \n\n11 \nIn the alternative, the district court declared that \nDOMA  also  failed  rational-basis  review,  and \nconcluded  that  none  of  the  interests  advanced  by \nCongress in enacting DOMA, or the House in this \nlitigation, supported it.  App. 44a-60a.  In doing so, \nthe  district  court  held  that  Congress  could  not \ncredibly  desire  a  nationally-uniform  approach \ntoward federal recognition of same-sex relationships, \nnor could it rationally desire to proceed with caution \nin this area.  App. 54a-60a.  This was clear because, \nin the district court’s view, Congress also has not \nbarred (or did not bar in the past) federal recognition \nof  marriages  on  which  the  states  take  (or  have \ntaken)  differing  approaches—such  as  interracial \nmarriages,  teen  marriages,  or  marriages  by  close \nrelatives.  App. 55a, 58a.  The court concluded that \nsaving  money  is  not  a  rational  basis  for  DOMA \nunless there is some further justification for how the \nmoney is saved.  App. 48a.  The district court also \ndismissed our society’s preference for children to be \nraised by their biological mothers and fathers as a \n“bias,” App. 51a, referred to the desire to preserve \nand nurture traditional marriage as being based on \n“the Bible,” App. 51a, 52a, and assumed that DOMA \ncannot  have  a  rational  basis  unless  “denying \nmarriage  benefits  only  to  same-sex  couples  will \nsomehow  make  marriage  between  opposite-sex \ncouples better.”  App. 52a. \nThe district court thus held DOMA as applied to \nMs. Golinski’s request for health insurance to be an \nequal-protection violation and entered a permanent \ninjunction requiring OPM to enroll Ms. Cunninghis \nin its health coverage plan.  The Department has not \nsought a stay of that injunction, and Ms. Cunninghis \n\n12 \nhas been enrolled in the plan.  Letter from Shirley \nPatterson, Ass’t Dir., Fed. Employee Ins. Ops., OPM, \nto William Breskin, V.P., Gov’t Programs, Blue Cross \nand Blue Shield Ass’n (Mar. 9, 2012), Golinski, Nos. \n12-15388 & 12-15409 (9th Cir. Apr. 5, 2012) (ECF \nNo. 21-2). \nc.  Ninth Circuit Proceedings \nThe House appealed the district court’s judgment \non February 24, 2012.  Although the district court \nhad  entered  the  judgment  and  accepted  the  legal \ntheory advanced by the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment filed a separate Notice of Appeal.  The \nDepartment made clear it was attempting to appeal \non the same issues the House had appealed.  See \nOPM  Mediation  Questionnaire,  Golinski,  No.  12-\n15409 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 2012).  The House moved to \ndismiss the Department’s appeal on the grounds that \nit  is  superfluous  and  that  the  Department  lacked \nappellate standing.  A motions panel of the Ninth \nCircuit has deferred this issue to the eventual merits \npanel.  Order at 2, Golinski, Nos. 12-15388 & 12-\n15409 (9th Cir. Apr. 11, 2012). \nPresumably  attempting  to  avoid  the  unwelcome \nprospect of explaining to a Ninth Circuit panel why \nDOMA was unconstitutional when the Department \nconceded  that  Ninth  Circuit  precedents  require \nrational-basis  review  and  had  elsewhere  conceded \nrational  bases  for  DOMA  exist,  the  Department \npetitioned for initial en banc hearing.  Pet. for Initial \nHrg.  En  Banc,  Golinski  (9th  Cir.  Mar.  26,  2012).  \nThat  effort  to  circumvent  the  normal  appellate \nprocess  was  denied  by  the  Ninth  Circuit,  with  no \njudge even requesting a poll.  Order, Golinski (9th \nCir.  May  22,  2012).    Recognizing  that  the \n\n13 \nDepartment supported the judgment below despite \nbeing a nominal appellant, the Ninth Circuit set a \nbriefing schedule under which the Department filed \nits substantive brief at the appellee stage.  Order at \n2, Golinski (9th Cir. Apr. 11, 2012).  In its brief, the \nDepartment  acknowledged  that  the  district  court \nhad  contravened  binding  circuit  precedent  by \napplying heightened scrutiny.  Br. for OPM, et al. 17, \nGolinski (9th Cir. July 3, 2012). \nBriefing in the Ninth Circuit was complete as of \nJuly 31, 2012.  The Ninth Circuit has held the case \nin abeyance pending this Court’s disposition of the \nDepartment’s Petition for certiorari before judgment \nin this case.  Order, Golinski (9th Cir. July 27, 2012). \n4.  Other Pending Petitions Involving DOMA \nSection 3 \nThe question of DOMA’s  constitutionality is also \npresented  by  five  other  petitions  for  certiorari \npending before this Court.  Three petitions arise out \nof the First Circuit’s decision and judgment in the \nconsolidated cases Massachusetts v. U.S. Department \nof HHS and Gill v. Office of Personnel Management, \n682 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2012).  In that case, the First \nCircuit held DOMA unconstitutional under a novel \n“intensified  scrutiny”  standard  of  equal  protection \nreview.  Id. at 10.  On June 29, 2012, the House filed \nthe first petition for certiorari seeking review of the \nFirst Circuit’s decision.  See Pet. for Cert., No. 12-13, \nBipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House \nof  Representatives  v.  Gill.    On  July  3,  the \nDepartment filed its own petition in that case, No. \n12-15.    And  on  July  20,  Massachusetts  filed  a \nconditional cross-petition, No. 12-97.  No party has \nopposed the House’s Petition in No. 12-13. \n\n14 \nFollowing  the  Department’s  decision  to  seek \ncertiorari  before  judgment  here,  private  party \nplaintiffs  have  filed  petitions  for  certiorari  before \njudgment in two cases now pending in the Second \nCircuit.  See Windsor v. United States, 833 F. Supp. \n2d 394 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), appeals pending, Nos. 12-\n2335 & 12-2435, pet. for cert. before judgment filed, \nNo. 12-63; Pedersen v. OPM, No. 10-cv-1750, 2012 \nWL  3113883  (D.  Conn.  July  31,  2012),  appeal \npending, No. 12-3273, pet. for cert. before judgment \nfiled, No. 12-231.  The petitions for certiorari before \njudgment  were  filed  in  Windsor  and  Pedersen  on \nJuly 16 and August 21, respectively.  Unlike in this \ncase,  the  Department  has  not  petitioned  for \ncertiorari before judgment in Windsor or Pedersen. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \nA grant of certiorari before judgment in the Court \nof  Appeals  “is  an  extremely  rare  occurrence.”  \nColeman  v.  Paccar,  Inc.,  424  U.S.  1301,  1304  n.* \n(1976)  (Rehnquist,  J.,  in  chambers).    This  Court’s \nRule 11 provides that such a writ “will be granted \nonly  upon  a  showing  that  the  case  is  of  such \nimperative public importance as to justify deviation \nfrom  normal  appellate  practice  and  to  require \nimmediate determination in this Court.”  \nThis case does not remotely satisfy that standard.  \nAlthough  the  issue  of  DOMA’s  constitutionality  is \nindeed  a  matter  of  great  importance,  particularly \ngiven the confrontation between the Legislative and \nExecutive Branches engendered by the Department’s \nactions in this litigation, that issue has already been \nbrought  before  this  Court  by  “normal  appellate \npractice”—in the form of the House’s Petition after \ndecision and judgment in Gill, a case in which the \n\n15 \nHouse,  Department,  Massachusetts,  and  the \nindividual  plaintiffs  all  agree  that  certiorari  is \nappropriate.  Thus, nothing is gained from granting \ncertiorari before judgment in this case. \nInstead, granting the writ here would result only \nin  unnecessary  duplication  and  confusion.    The \nDepartment prevailed both in the district court here \nand  in  the  First  Circuit  in  Gill.    There  is  no \njustification for allowing the Department to file an \nopening and reply brief in either case, let alone to \nproceed on completely different briefing schedules in \nthis case and in Gill.  Moreover, not only is there no \njustification  for  taking  the  extraordinary  step  of \ngranting certiorari before judgment when the exact \nsame issue is squarely presented in an earlier-filed \npetition for certiorari after judgment, but this case \nfeatures vehicle problems not present in  Gill.   As \nexplained at length in the House’s opposition in No. \n12-15, it is not clear that a prevailing party even has \nappellate  standing  to  seek  this  Court’s  review.  \nAlthough those principles may apply differently in \nthe  certiorari  before  judgment  context,  there  is \ncertainly no reason to grant that extraordinary relief \nand confront those issues when the same underlying \nconstitutional issue is squarely presented in a case \nin  which  the  First  Circuit  has  already  issued  its \nopinion and entered judgment.   \nThe Department’s effort to obtain certiorari before \njudgment in this case is truly extraordinary.  If the \nDepartment  were  really  eager  to  seek  certiorari \nbefore judgment, it could have done so years ago.  It \nmakes little sense for the Department to make that \nextraordinary  request  only  after  a  case—Gill—is \nproperly before this Court in the ordinary course of \n\n16 \nappellate proceedings.  This case would add nothing \nexcept  procedural  complications  to  this  Court’s \nconsideration  of  DOMA’s  constitutionality  in  Gill.  \nThe proper course here is also the straightforward \none:  There is no reason for the Department or this \nCourt to search through the dockets of the courts of \nappeals  for  cases  implicating  DOMA’s \nconstitutionality when the First Circuit has ruled.  \nThe  First  Circuit  rejected  the  House’s  arguments \nand the House alone seeks to have the First Circuit’s \njudgment overturned.  Under these circumstances, \nthe Court should grant the House’s Petition in No. \n12-13 and deny the Department’s premature Petition \nhere as well as the other premature petitions it has \nfostered.   \nI.  Gill  Presents  Exactly  the  Same  Question \nRegarding DOMA’s Constitutionality. \nThe  question  presented  by  the  Department’s \nPetition in this case regarding DOMA is identical to \nthe House’s Question 1 in Gill.  Compare Pet. (II) \nwith Pet. No. 12-13 i.7  In its Gill opinion, the First \nCircuit passed on exactly the same question as did \nthe district court in this case:  Whether DOMA is \ncompatible  with  the  Fifth  Amendment’s  implicit \nguarantee  of  equal protection.    Likewise,  the  sub-\nissues addressed by the two courts were the same:  \nBoth opinions involved discussion of the proper level \nof  constitutional  scrutiny  to  apply,  and  the \ngovernment interests supporting DOMA considered \nby  the  two  courts  were  virtually  identical.    Thus, \nthere  is  no  aspect  of  the  issues  that  would  be \n                                            \n7 The Department’s petition in Gill also presents that same \nquestion.  See Pet. No. 12-15 (I).   \n\n17 \npresented  in  this  case  as  to  DOMA’s \nconstitutionality that the Court could not address as \neasily (or more easily) in Gill instead.  \nPetitioners  do  not  really  appear  to  suggest \notherwise.  Their only explanation for their Petition \nis  their  vague  assertion  that  “[c]ertiorari  before \njudgment  is  warranted  * * *  to  ensure  that  this \nCourt  has  an  adequate  vehicle  to  resolve  the \nquestion of Section 3’s constitutionality in a timely \nand definitive manner.”  Pet. 11 (emphasis added); \nsee  also  Pet.  15  (“A  grant  of  certiorari  before \njudgment in this case is warranted to ensure that \nthe Court will have an appropriate vehicle in which \nto  resolve  the  issues  presented  in  a  timely  and \ndefinitive  fashion.”)  (emphasis  added).    But \nPetitioners offer little or no argument that Gill—a \ncase  in  which  normal  appellate  practice  has  been \nfollowed and in which the Department itself seeks \nreview—is not an equally or more “adequate” and \n“appropriate” vehicle to consider the same issues.   \nPetitioners baldly state that “[t]he district court’s \nanalysis” in this case of whether heightened scrutiny \nshould  apply  “may  materially  assist  this  Court’s \nconsideration  of  that  question.”    Pet.  13.    Ms. \nGolinski  apparently  agrees.    Resp.  4-5.    But,  this \nCourt  will  have  the  benefit  of  the  district  court’s \nanalysis—as well as that of multiple other district \ncourts, some of which have upheld DOMA and some \nof  which  have  struck  it  down—whether  or  not  it \ngrants an extraordinary petition for certiorari before \njudgment.    Indeed,  to  the  extent  anything \ndistinguishes the district court’s analysis from that \nof  other  courts,  it  is  that  Petitioners  have \nacknowledged that the district court’s entire inquiry \n\n18 \ninto  heightened  scrutiny  was  inappropriate  under \nbinding Ninth Circuit precedent requiring rational \nbasis  scrutiny.    See  supra  p.  13.    In  all  events, \nnothing  prevents  the  Department  from  citing  the \ndistrict court’s analysis here in its merits brief in \nGill.   \nNor is this a situation in which the Court might \nwish to grant certiorari before judgment in a case \nsimilar to one that has come before it in the ordinary \ncourse, in order to articulate how the rule of law it \nannounces will apply to different factual and legal \ncontexts.  DOMA’s constitutionality is a straight up-\nor-down  proposition  that  will  not  vary  by  context:  \nNo party or court has yet contended or  concluded \nthat  DOMA  might  be  constitutional  only  in  some \nsituations  or  only  as  applied  to  some  plaintiffs.  \nIndeed,  plaintiffs  typically  suggest  that  DOMA’s \nacross-the-board  nature  and  lack  of  context-\nspecificity are part and parcel of its constitutional \ndifficulty.  See, e.g., Br. of Pls.-Appellees Nancy Gill, \net al. 8-12, Massachusetts, Nos. 10-2204, 10-2207, & \n10-2214 (1st Cir. Oct. 28, 2011).  For this reason, the \ncases cited by Petitioners and Ms. Golinski involving \ngrants  of  certiorari  before  judgment  to  consider \nvarying aspects of a single constitutional question, \nsee Pet. at 14-15, Resp. at 7, are inapposite here.8  In \n                                            \n8  Citing  United  States  v.  Fanfan,  543  U.S.  220  (2005) \n(reviewing particular applications of the Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines with United States v. Booker); Gratz v. Bollinger, \n539 U.S. 244 (2003) (reviewing various university affirmative-\naction policies together with Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 \n(2003)); Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 344 U.S. 1, 3 (1952) (inviting \npetition  in  Bolling  v.  Sharpe,  347  U.S.  497,  498  (1954),  to \nreview various racial classifications); Norman v. Baltimore & \n\n19 \naddition, this case and Gill do not involve the same \nfacts,  as  did  the  New  Haven  Inclusion  Cases,  399 \nU.S. 392, 418 (1970).  See Pet. 15.  Indeed, this case \ninvolves a single application of DOMA, while it is \nGill  that  considers  its  application  in  multiple \ncontexts.   \nIn short, there is no good reason for this Court to \ntake  the  extraordinary  step  of  granting  certiorari \nbefore judgment when the exact same issue is before \nthe  Court—and  better  presented—in  a  petition \nseeking review of the decision and judgment of the \nFirst Circuit in Gill.  \nII.  This  Case  Presents  Vehicle  Problems  Not \nPresented by the House’s Petition in Gill. \nGranting  certiorari  in  this  case,  however,  would \ncomplicate  consideration  of  the  important \nconstitutional issue raised in Gill both procedurally \nand  substantively.    Procedurally,  because  the \nDepartment prevailed both in the First Circuit and \nthe district court here, it would make no sense to \ngive the Department the benefit of an opening and \nreply brief in either case, and it would make even \nless sense to have disparate briefing schedules such \nthat those defending DOMA would file first in Gill \nwhile the Department files first here.  Thus, if the \nCourt were to grant certiorari before judgment here, \nit  would  have  to  engage  in  a  series  of  procedural \nmachinations to align the parties properly.  There is \nno reason to go through those steps when the Court \ncan simply grant the House’s Petition in No. 12-13, \nthereby  allowing  the  aggrieved  party  to  file  as \n                                                                                         \nO.R. Co., 294 U.S. 240, 243 (1935) (considering varying factual \napplications of a statute in two consolidated cases). \n\n20 \nPetitioner  and  the  prevailing  parties  to  file  as \nRespondents. \nThe complications flowing from the Department’s \nsuccess  in  the  district  court  go  well  beyond \nscheduling.  As explained more fully in the House \nopposition  in  No.  12-15,  it  is  not  clear  that  the \nDepartment even has appellate standing to petition.  \nWhile  appellate  standing  principles  may  apply \ndifferently in the certiorari before judgment context, \nthere is no reason for this Court to get sidetracked \nby  questions  concerning  appellate  standing,  the \nscope  of  INS  v.  Chadha,  462  U.S.  919,  930-931 \n(1983), or how those principles apply in the certiorari \nbefore judgment context.  To the contrary, the Court \ncan avoid all of these side issues and focus on the \nimportant  question  of  DOMA’s  constitutionality \nsimply by granting the House’s Petition in No. 12-13. \nIII. Certiorari  in  This  Case  Would  Not \nExpedite This Court’s Review of DOMA. \nPetitioners assert that this Court has “previously \ngranted certiorari before judgment when necessary \nto obtain expeditious resolution” of a case.  Pet. 14.  \nMs. Golinski echoes this contention.  Resp. 6.  But \npromoting expedition is just one more reason why \ncertiorari  before  judgment  is  inappropriate  here.  \nGiven the concurrent pendency of the House’s Gill \nPetition, granting certiorari before judgment in this \ncase is not “necessary” for expeditious resolution of \nDOMA’s constitutionality; in fact it would not speed \nthe process at all.  Moreover, neither Petitioners nor \nMs. Golinski point to any injury that either of them \nmight suffer if the Ninth Circuit were permitted to \nreview this case, or if this Court were to consider \nDOMA’s constitutionality in Gill instead.  Nor could \n\n21 \nthey.    Ms.  Golinski  currently  is  receiving  all  the \nrelief she requested pursuant to the district court’s \ninjunction,  Petitioners  acquiesced  in  the  grant  of \nthat relief rather than seek a stay, and this case’s \nultimate resolution will in no way be delayed if the \nwrit is granted in Gill instead. \nEven  if  this  were  not  the  case,  the  Department \ncannot  credibly  assert  an  extraordinary  need  for \nexpedition, when the Executive Branch’s own actions \nthroughout  the  DOMA  litigation  have  been \nthoroughly  inconsistent  with  that  position.    If  the \nDepartment believed that certiorari before judgment \nwas appropriate, it could have sought such review as \nearly as October 2010 when it appealed the Gill and \nMassachusetts  cases.    There  would  have  been  no \nquestion  about  appellate  standing  then  either \nbecause at the time the Department was defending \nDOMA.    If  a  desire  for  expedition  were  somehow \nlinked to the Department’s abdication of its defense \nof DOMA, it could have sought certiorari as early as \nFebruary  2011.    Thus,  the  Department  offers  no \ncredible reason for waiting until July 2012.  While \npresumably  the  decision  to  seek  review  here  was \nsomehow  linked  to  the  House’s  decision  to  seek \nreview of the First Circuit’s decision, that connection \nis baffling and in no way supports the Department’s \nexpedition  argument.    Indeed,  the  Department’s \nfiling for certiorari before judgment appears to have \nbeen  precipitated  by  the  one  thing  that  makes \ncertiorari  before  judgment  less  appropriate—a \npending petition for certiorari allowing the Court to \nconsider  DOMA’s  constitutionality  in  the  normal \ncourse of orderly appellate review.    \n\n22 \nNor  has  the  Department  offered  any  credible \nreason  why  this  case  is  a  better  vehicle  for  this \nCourt’s review than is any other case pending in, but \nnot  decided  by,  a  court  of  appeals.    This  failure \narguably explains why the Department’s decision to \nseek certiorari before judgment was quickly followed \nby premature petitions filed by two private parties.  \nThere is no obvious yardstick for comparing these \nequally premature petitions, but there is an obvious \nreason  to  prefer  review  in  Gill:    The  case  has \nfollowed the normal course of appellate review and \nthe  Court  has  the  benefit  of  the  First  Circuit’s \ndecision and judgment.    \nIV. The  Department  Operates  As  a  De  Facto \nAmicus  in  This  Case  And  That  Status  Is \nBest  Accommodated  By  Granting  The \nHouse’s Petition in No. 12-13 Alone. \nEver  since  the  Department  abandoned  its \ntraditional  responsibility  of  defending  the \nconstitutionality of DOMA, it has operated as a de \nfacto amicus supporting the arguments of plaintiffs \nattacking  DOMA’s  constitutionality.    As  such,  the \nDepartment  is  not  entitled  to  any  special \nconsideration  of  its  views  as  to  the  appropriate \nvehicle for this Court’s review.  Thus, where the only \nparty  defending  DOMA  (the  House)  and  the \nplaintiffs who have attacked DOMA all agree that \nGill is an appropriate vehicle for this Court’s review, \nthe Department’s suggestion that this Court should \naccept its extraordinary Petition for certiorari before \njudgment should be viewed with deep skepticism. \nMoreover, given the Department’s role as a de facto \namicus  supporting  the  plaintiffs,  granting  this \nPetition would lead to procedural complications and \n\n23 \nrequire the Court to realign the parties for purposes \nof  briefing  and  argument.    There  is  no  need  to \nscramble the parties by granting this Petition only to \nundo the effect by granting later procedural motions \nwhen the House’s Petition in No. 12-13 accurately \nreflects the actual alignment of the parties.  In the \nHouse’s Petition, all of the parties attacking DOMA \nare respondents who support affirmance.  They can \nfile “bottom-side” briefs defending the decision and \njudgment below and propose a division of argument \namong  themselves.    If  this  Court  grants  the \nDepartment’s Petition here, it will presumably need \nto consolidate the cases and realign the parties to \nachieve the same basic effect.  There is no need for \nsuch machinations.  The correct answer here is also \nthe most straightforward:  The proper petitioner is \nthe  party  aggrieved  by  the  one  court  of  appeals \ndecision to reach final judgment.  The Court should \ngrant the House’s Petition in No. 12-13, and deny \nthis  premature  Petition  as  well  as  the  other \nPetitions  seeking  the  extraordinary  remedy  of \ncertiorari before judgment.     \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Department’s \nPetition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  before  judgment \nshould be denied.  The House’s Petition for certiorari \nin No. 12-13 should be granted. \n\n24 \nRespectfully submitted, \nPAUL D. CLEMENT \n  Counsel of Record \nH. CHRISTOPHER BARTOLOMUCCI \nNICHOLAS J.

After their 2008 marriage, Golinski sought to enroll\nCunninghis in her family health insurance plan under the Federal Employees\nHealth Benefits program. The enrollment request was denied on the basis that their\nsame-sex marriage could not be federally recognized under § 3 of the Defense of\nMarriage Act (“DOMA”). \nGolinski first pursued administrative remedies through the Ninth Circuit’s\nEmployment Dispute Resolution Plan (“EDR Plan”), which prohibits\ndiscrimination based on sex or sexual orientation. Chief Judge Kozinski, sitting in\nhis administrative capacity, found that Golinski had suffered discrimination under\n2\n\nCase:C 1a2s-1e533:1808- c  v - 0070/22537/2-J0S1W3       D   o  c IuDm: e8n7t1240813  6 F  i l e Dd0kt7E/2n9tr/y1:3 1  6 P2 a  g  eP3a ogfe 4: 3 of 4\nthe meaning of the EDR Plan and ordered that her spousal health insurance\nenrollment be processed. However, the Office of Personnel Management directed\nGolinski’s health insurance carrier otherwise, advising that processing the\nenrollment would violate DOMA.\nGolinski filed suit, contending that § 3 of DOMA, as applied to her, violated\nthe equal protection and due process components of the Fifth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution. The district court granted Golinski’s motion for summary\njudgment, holding that § 3 of DOMA “unconstitutionally discriminates against\nsame-sex couples” and therefore “violates [Golinski]’s right to equal protection of\nthe law under the Fifth Amendment.” The district court issued a permanent\ninjunction “enjoining defendants . . . from interfering with the enrollment of Ms.\nGolinski’s wife in her family health benefits plan.”\nThese consolidated appeals followed. Pursuant to an order issued December\n11, 2012, we held the case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court’s resolution of\nUnited States v. Windsor, No. 12-307. On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court issued\nits opinion in Windsor, holding that § 3 of DOMA “is unconstitutional as a\ndeprivation of liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the\nConstitution.” United States v. Windsor, — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2695 (2013).\n3\n\nCase:C 1a2s-1e533:1808- c  v - 0070/22537/2-J0S1W3       D   o  c IuDm: e8n7t1240813  6 F  i l e Dd0kt7E/2n9tr/y1:3 1  6 P2 a  g  eP4a ogfe 4: 4 of 4\nIn light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Windsor, the parties have jointly\nstipulated that “dismissal is the appropriate disposition of [these] consolidated\nappeals.”\nThese consolidated appeals are therefore DISMISSED. The copy of this\norder shall constitute the mandate of this court.\n4",

These motions compel the Court to determine whether the Defense\n22 of Marriage Act (“DOMA”), 1 U.S.C. Section 7, as applied to Ms. Golinski, violates the United\n23 States Constitution by refusing to recognize lawful marriages in the application of laws\n24 governing benefits for federal employees.

Ms. Golinski is a staff attorney in the Motions\n3 Unit of the Office of Staff Attorneys in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \n4 (Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) at ¶ 18.)  Ms. Golinski has been partners with Amy\n5 Cunninghis (“Ms. Cunninghis”) for over twenty years.  They registered as domestic partners\n6 with the City and County of San Francisco in 1995, and with the State of California in 2003. \n7 (Id. at ¶¶ 15-17.)  On August 21, 2008, they were legally married under the laws of the State of\n8 California.  (Id. at ¶ 17.)  \n9 Shortly after they married, Ms. Golinski sought to enroll Ms. Cunninghis in her existing\n10 family coverage health insurance plan, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan, which\nt 11 she purchases through her employer and which already covers the couple’s adopted minor child. \nr\nu\no\na 12 (Id. at ¶¶ 19, 22.)  The Administrative Office of the United States Courts (“AO”) refused to\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 process her request on the basis that Ms. Golinski and her spouse are both women.  (Id. at ¶ 23.) \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Finding that she could not secure comparable health insurance coverage, on October 2, 2008,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Ms. Golinski filed a complaint under the Ninth Circuit’s Employment Dispute Resolution\nS N 16 (“EDR”) Plan, and contended that the refusal to grant her health benefits was a violation of the\nted  For the  17 Plan’s nondiscrimination provision.  (Id. at ¶ 48.)  The EDR Plan specifically prohibits\ni\nn\nU\n18 employment discrimination based on, among other things, sex or sexual orientation.  (Id. at ¶\n19 47.)   \n20 By orders dated November 24, 2008 and January 13, 2009, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski,\n21 sitting in his administrative capacity as arbiter of the Judicial Council, found that Ms. Golinski\n22 had suffered discrimination under the Court’s EDR Plan and ordered the AO to process her\n23 health benefit election forms.  (Id., Exs. A, B.)  Chief Judge Kozinski found that the denial of\n24 health benefits was based solely on the grounds of sex and sexual orientation, in direct violation\n25 of the EDR Plan’s non-discrimination provision covering Ninth Circuit employees.  (Id., Ex. B\n26 at 1-2.)  Chief Judge Kozinski found that, regardless of the language in DOMA, the OPM had\n27 the discretion to extend health benefits to Ms. Golinski’s same-sex spouse by interpreting the\n28 terms “family members” and “member of the family” to set a floor, not a ceiling, to coverage\n2\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page3 of 43\n1 eligibility.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Chief Judge Kozinski ordered the AO “to submit Karen Golinski’s\n2 Health Benefits Election form 2089 ... to the appropriate insurance carrier.  Any future health\n3 benefit forms are also to be processed without regard to the sex of the listed spouse.”  (Id., Ex.\n4 B at 7.) \n5 The AO complied, but the OPM instructed Ms. Golinski’s insurance carrier not to\n6 comply with the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council’s remedial order.  The OPM directed the AO\n7 and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan not to process Ms. Golinski’s request\n8 on the basis that federal law, specifically Section 3 of DOMA, defines spouse as a member of\n9 the opposite sex and, accordingly, proscribes the enrollment of Ms. Golinski’s same-sex spouse\n10 in her health benefits program.\nt 11 In response, on November 19, 2009, Chief Judge Kozinski issued another order\nr\nu\no\na 12 addressing the OPM’s conduct.  The Chief Judge, again sitting as an administrator, held that he\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 had the authority, under both the Ninth Circuit’s EDR Plan and the separation of powers\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 doctrine, to interpret the laws applicable to judicial employees in a manner that would displace\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 “any contrary interpretation by an agency or an officer of the Executive.”  (Id., Ex. C at 14-15.) \nS N 16 Chief Judge Kozinski held that allowing the OPM to interfere with his orders would be\nted  For the  17 tantamount to permitting it to exercise “dominance over logistics to destroy [the Judiciary’s]\ni\nn\nU\n18 autonomy.”  (Id. at 11.)  The Chief Judge further held that “[o]rdering enrollment is proper and\n19 within my jurisdiction because Congress intended [the EDR] tribunal to be the sole forum for\n20 adjudicating complaints of workplace discrimination by employees of the Judiciary.  With that\n21 responsibility must come power equal to the task.”  (Id. at 9.)  \n22 Chief Judge Kozinski granted Ms. Golinski both back pay and prospective relief.  The\n23 injunctive relief required that the OPM “rescind its guidance or directive to the Blue Cross and\n24 Blue Shield Service Benefit plan and any other plan that Ms. Golinski’s wife is not eligible to\n25 be enrolled as her spouse under the terms of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program\n26 because of her sex or sexual orientation, or that the plans would violate their contracts with the\n27 OPM by enrolling Ms. Golinski’s wife as a beneficiary” and “[c]ease at once its interference\n28 with the jurisdiction of this tribunal.  Specifically, OPM shall not advise Ms. Golinski’s health\n3\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page4 of 43\n1 plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan, that providing coverage for Ms.\n2 Golinski’s wife violates DOMA or any other federal law.  Nor shall OPM interfere in any way\n3 with the delivery of health benefits to Ms. Golinski’s wife on the basis of her sex or sexual\n4 orientation.”  (Id. at 15-16 (emphasis in original).)  \n5 The Chief Judge, in his order dated November 19, 2009, also invited the OPM to\n6 “appeal so much of this order as concerns it using the procedures outlines in the [EDR] plan.” \n7 (Id. at 16.)  In response, the OPM did not appeal the order, but instead issued a press release\n8 indicating that it was under no obligation to comply with the administrative order and, although\n9 in favor of its repeal, indicated that the Executive agency was tasked with enforcing DOMA,\n10 which prohibits same-sex spouses of federal employees from enrolling in the federal health\nt 11 benefits program.  (Id., Ex. F.)  \nr\nu\no\na 12 In his final administrative order, dated December 22, 2009, Chief Judge Kozinski stated\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 that the time for appeal had expired, thus rendering his prior orders in the matter “final and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 preclusive on all issues decided therein.”  (Id., Ex. D.)  He further authorized Ms. Golinski to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 pursue any action she deemed fit against the OPM, including filing a mandamus action in the\nS N 16 district court.  (Id.) \nted  For the  17 On January 20, 2010, Ms. Golinski filed a mandamus action before this Court, seeking\ni\nn\nU\n18 to have the OPM rescind its guidance to Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan to\n19 deny Ms. Golinski’s wife benefits as precluded by DOMA and to comply with Chief Judge\n20 Kozinski’s prior orders in her administrative claim.  \n21 On January 26, 2010, Ms. Golinski moved for a preliminary injunction seeking\n22 compliance with Chief Judge Kozinski’s order dated November 19, 2009, requiring that the\n23 OPM: (1) “rescind its guidance or directive to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit\n24 Plan,” and (2) “cease at once its interference with the jurisdiction of this tribunal” and “not\n25 advise Ms. Golinski’s health plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit plan, that\n26 providing coverage for Ms. Golinski’s wife violates DOMA or any other federal law.”  (Id. at\n27 Ex. C, 15-16.)  \n28\n4\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page5 of 43\n1 On May 10, 2010, the OPM moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint on the basis\n2 that this Court lacked jurisdiction to grant mandamus relief under these peculiar procedural\n3 circumstances. \n4 While those motions were pending and after the parties submitted supplemental briefing\n5 on the issue of the constitutionality of DOMA, on February 23, 2011, at the direction of\n6 President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would\n7 cease its legal defense of Section 3 of DOMA.  Although it determined that the statute was\n8 unconstitutional and resolved not to continue to defend DOMA in pending court cases, the\n9 Justice Department indicated that it did intend to continue to enforce the law unless it was either\n10 repealed by Congress or the courts rendered a final judgment striking it down.  (See Plaintiff’s\nt 11 Notice of Supplemental Authority (“NSA”) dated February 23, 2011, Ex. 2.)\nr\nu\no\na 12 On March 16, 2011, the Court granted the motion to dismiss on the basis that it lacked\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 jurisdiction to issue mandamus relief.  Finding that amendment would not necessarily be futile,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the Court dismissed the matter with leave to amend.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 On April 14, 2011, Ms. Golinski filed her Second Amended Complaint in which she\nS N 16 directly challenges the discrimination against her as a lesbian married to someone of the same\nted  For the  17 sex.  (SAC at ¶ 1.)  In her amended complaint, Ms. Golinski alleges an action for declaratory\ni\nn\nU\n18 and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 2201-2202 and Federal Rule of Civil\n19 Procedure 57 and for review of an agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Sections 701-706.  (Id. at\n20 ¶ 7.)  By her amended complaint, Ms. Golinski seeks a determination that Section 3 of DOMA,\n21 1 U.S.C. Section 7, as applied to her, violates the United States Constitution by refusing to\n22 recognize lawful marriages for the purposes of application of the laws governing benefits for\n23 federal employees.  (Id.)  Ms. Golinski alleges that as a result of the violation of the\n24 Constitution, she has been denied, and will continue to be denied, legal protections and benefits\n25 under federal law that would be available to her if she were a heterosexual with a opposite-sex\n26 spouse.  (Id.)  \n27 The majority of a five-member committee in Congress voted to defend DOMA and, on\n28 May 4, 2011, BLAG sought to intervene in this matter.  On June 3, 2011, this Court issued an\n5\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page6 of 43\n1 order granting BLAG’s unopposed motion to intervene as a party-defendant for the limited\n2 purpose of defending the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA.\n3 On June 3, 2011, BLAG moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on the basis\n4 that Ms. Golinski fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because, as a matter of\n5 law, Section 3 of DOMA does not violate her rights under the equal protection component of\n6 the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On the same date, the OPM moved to dismiss\n7 Ms. Golinski’s claim as set forth in the Second Amended Complaint only insofar as any claims\n8 could reasonably be construed to assert a statutory claim as to the language of the Federal\n9 Health Benefits Act of 1959. On July 1, 2011, Ms. Golinski moved for summary judgment.  On\n10 July 15, 2011, BLAG moved to strike extrinsic materials from the record on Ms. Golinski’s\nt 11 opposition to the motion to dismiss.

Motion to Dismiss.\nted  For the  17 A motion to dismiss is proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) where the\ni\nn\nU\n18 pleadings fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  The Court’s “inquiry is limited\n19 to the allegations in the complaint, which are accepted as true and construed in the light most\n20 favorable to the plaintiff.”  Lazy Y Ranch Ltd. v. Behrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008).\n21 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires only “a short and plain statement of the claim\n22 showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Even under Rule 8(a)’s liberal pleading standard,\n23 “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more\n24 than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will\n25\n26\n27 1  Initially, BLAG moved to strike several declarations submitted by Ms. Golinski in\nresponse to the motion to dismiss.  However, as the Court decides the motion for summary\n28 judgment and has therefore considered the full record, BLAG agreed to withdraw its motion\nto strike.  The motion to strike is therefore DENIED as moot.\n6\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page7 of 43\n1 not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citing Papasan v.\n2 Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)). \n3 Pursuant to Twombly, a plaintiff must not merely allege conduct that is conceivable but\n4 must instead allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at\n5 570.  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\n6 court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” \n7 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n8 556).  “The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more\n9 than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. ... When a complaint pleads facts\n10 that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between\nt 11 possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57)\nr\nu\no\na 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).  If the allegations are insufficient to state a claim, a court\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 should grant leave to amend, unless amendment would be futile.  See, e.g., Reddy v.

Such consideration does not convert the motion to dismiss\n26 into a motion for summary judgment.  See United States v.

Motion for Summary Judgment.\n2 A motion for summary judgment is guided by a different standard.  Summary judgment\n3 is appropriate when the record demonstrates “that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n4 fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). \n5 An issue is “genuine” if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to find for the\n6 non-moving party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1986).  “[A]t the\n7 summary judgment stage the judge’s function is not ... to weigh the evidence and determine the\n8 truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. at 249.  A fact\n9 is “material” if it may affect the outcome of the case.  Id. at 248.  The party moving for\n10 summary judgment bears the initial responsibility of identifying those portions of the record\nt 11 which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of a material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\nr\nu\no\na 12 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  In the absence of such facts, “the moving party is entitled to a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 judgment as a matter of law.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Once the moving party meets this initial burden, the non-moving party “may not rest\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party’s pleading, but the adverse party's\nS N 16 response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts\nted  For the  17 showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).   If the non-moving party\ni\nn\nU\n18 fails to make this showing, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Celotex,\n19 477 U.S. at 323.\n20 B. Defense of Marriage Act.\n21 This action presents a challenge to the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA as\n22 applied to Ms. Golinski, a lesbian woman married under California law, who is unable to secure\n23 federal health benefits for her same-sex spouse.  Specifically, Ms. Golinski alleges that, by\n24 operation of Section 3 of DOMA, she has been denied certain marriage-based federal benefits\n25 that are available to similarly-situated opposite-sex couples, in violation of her rights to equal\n26 protection and due process as secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n27\n28\n8\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page9 of 43\n1 In 1996, Congress enacted and President Clinton signed DOMA into law.  Section 3 of\n2 DOMA, the only provision at issue in this matter, defines the terms “marriage” and “spouse” for\n3 purposes of federal law.  Section 3 provides:\n4 In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling,\nregulation,  or interpretation of the various adm inistrative  bureaus and\n5 agencies of the United States, the word “marriage” means only a legal union\nbetween one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word\n6 “spouse” refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a\nwife.\n7\n1 U.S.C. § 7. \n8\nIn large part, the enactment of DOMA can be understood as a direct legislative response\n9\nto Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 decision issued by the Hawaii Supreme Court, which indicated that\n10\nsame-sex couples may be entitled to marry under that state’s constitution.  74 Haw. 530 (1993).\nt 11\nr\nu The decision raised the possibility that, for the first time, same-sex couples could begin the\no\na 12\nC ni\n  or process of obtaining state-sanctioned marriage licenses.  \nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  In debating the provisions of DOMA, the House referenced the Baehr decision as the\n Dis District  14 beginning of an “orchestrated assault being waged against traditional heterosexual marriage”\ntates orthern  15 and expressed concern that the development “threaten[ed] to have very real consequences ... on\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 federal law.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-664 at 2-3 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2905,\ni\nn 2906-07 (“H. Rep.” or “House Report”).  More specifically, the House Report warned that “a\nU\n18\nredefinition of marriage in Hawaii to include homosexual couples could make such couples\n19\neligible for a whole range of federal rights and benefits.”  Id. at 10.  Although a later\n20\namendment to the Hawaii constitution withheld permitting same-sex marriage in the state,\n21\nCongress, explicitly in reaction to the impending Hawaii decision, sought a means both (1) to\n22\n“reserve[] each State’s ability to decide” what should legally constitute a valid marriage under\n23\nits own state laws, and (2) to “lay[] down clear rules” regarding what constitutes a marriage for\n24\npurposes of federal law.  Id. at 2.  \n25\nIn Section 2 of DOMA, Congress, by virtue of the express grant of authority under the\n26\nsecond sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, permitted a state to decline to give effect to\n27\nthe laws of other states respecting same-sex marriage.  In enacting Section 3 of DOMA, the\n28\nHouse Report explained that the statute codifies the definition of marriage set forth in “the\n9\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page10 of 43\n1 standard law dictionary,” for purposes of federal law.  Id. at 29 (citing Black’s Law Dictionary\n2 972 (6th ed. 1990)).  \n3 The legislative history reveals that Congress acknowledged the constraints imposed by\n4 federalism on the determination of who may marry, which has always been uniquely the\n5 province of state law.  Nonetheless, Congress asserted that it was not “supportive of (or even\n6 indifferent to) the notion of same-sex marriage,” and it embraced DOMA as a step toward\n7 furthering Congress’ interests in “defend[ing] the institution of traditional heterosexual\n8 marriage.”  Id. at 12.  “Although DOMA drastically amended the eligibility criteria for a vast\n9 number of different federal benefits, rights, and privileges that depend upon marital status, the\n10 relevant committees did not engage in a meaningful examination of the scope or effect of the\nt 11 law.”  Gill v. Office of Personnel Management, 699 F. Supp. 2d 374, 379 (D. Mass. 2010).2 \nr\nu\no\na 12 Although drastically altering the benefits structure based on state definitions of marriage and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the federalist balance in the area of domestic relations, Congress did not hear testimony from\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 agency heads about the effect of DOMA on federal programs, or from historians, economists, or\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 specialists in family or child welfare.  Id.  \nS N 16 It is clear and undisputed that the federal health benefits Ms. Golinski seeks in trying to\nted  For the  17 add her wife as a beneficiary under her health benefits plan falls under the reach of DOMA. \ni\nn\nU\n18 The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (“FEHB”) is a comprehensive program\n19 providing health insurance for federal civilian employees and their family members.  5 U.S.C. §\n20 8905.  The OPM administers the FEHB and negotiates contracts for coverage with potential\n21 carriers and sets the premiums for each plan.  Id., §§ 8902, 8903, 8906.  A federal employee\n22 enrolled in the FEHB chooses a carrier and plan and may determine whether to enroll for an\n23 individual plan, named “self only,” or for “self and family” coverage which, under the OPM’s\n24 regulations, “includes all family members who are eligible to be covered by the enrollment.”  5\n25 C.F.R. § 890.302(a)(1).  Under the FEHB, a “member of family” is defined as either “the\n26\n2   In January 1997, the General Accounting Office issued a report clarifying the\n27 scope of DOMA’s effect and concluded that the law implicated at least 1,049 federal laws,\nincluding those related to entitlement programs like Social Security, health benefits and\n28 taxation.  A further study in 2004 found that 1,138 federal laws tied benefits, protections,\nrights, or responsibilities to marital status.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 379.\n10\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page11 of 43\n1 spouse of an employee ... [or] an unmarried dependent child under 22 years of age.”  5 U.S.C. §\n2 8901(5).  An employee enrolled under an individual plan may change to family coverage by\n3 submitting documentation to the employing office during the annual open season period or\n4 within sixty days of a change in family status, such as change in marital status.  Id., § 8905(f); 5\n5 C.F.R. §§ 890.301(f), (g).  \n6 Within sixty days of her marriage, Ms. Golinski sought to enroll her wife as a\n7 beneficiary of the family health plan.  The OPM found Ms. Cunninghis was ineligible to qualify\n8 as a member of the family because, under DOMA, she did not qualify as a spouse of an\n9 employee.3  The question before the Court is whether Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to Ms.\n10 Golinski, violates constitutional principles of equal protection.\nt 11 C. Equal Protection Analysis and Standard of Review.\nr\nu\no\na 12 The “Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, which is\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  City of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (internal citations omitted). \nS N 16 Although the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not contain an Equal\nted  For the  17 Protection Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause includes an equal protection\ni\nn\nU\n18 component.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499-500 (1954); see also Buckley v. Valeo,\n19\n20 3  At the administrative appeal from the denial of benefits, Chief Judge Kozinski\nfound that the FEHB statute confers on the OPM the discretion to extend health benefits to\n21 same-sex couples by interpreting the terms “family members” and “member of the family” to\nset a floor, not a ceiling, to coverage eligibility.  (SAC, Ex. B at 2-3.)  The Court finds this\n22 reasoning unpersuasive.  \n23 Where the statute unambiguously defines a term such as “member of family” to mean\nspouse (or dependent child under 22 years old), that definition controls to the exclusion of\n24 any meaning that is not explicitly stated in the definition.  See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S.\n379, 393 n.10 (1979); see also TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 28-29 (2001) (holding\n25 that, for purposes of statutory construction, expression of one thing is the exclusion of the\nother).  DOMA offers the same clarity and defines “spouse” for the purposes of determining\n26 the meaning of federal legislation as “a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a\nwife.”  1 U.S.C. § 7.  Confronted with such unambiguous statutory language, the Court is not\n27 persuaded that the FEHB statute could provide the OPM with the discretion to provide health\nbenefits to same-sex couples.  See In re Levenson, 587 F.3d 925, 930-31 (9th Cir. 2009);\n28 Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 385-86.  This disposes of Ms. Golinski’s remaining statutory claim\nand the OPM’s motion to dismiss that claim, to the extent it is still asserted, is GRANTED.\n11\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page12 of 43\n1 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976) (“Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as\n2 that under the Fourteenth Amendment.”).  \n3 “[T]he Constitution ‘neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.’”  Romer v.\n4 Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 623 (1996) (quoting Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896)\n5 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).  This principle embodies a commitment to neutrality where the rights\n6 of individual persons are at stake.  Dragovich v. United States Department of the Treasury, 764\n7 F. Supp. 2d 1178, 1188 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Romer, 517 U.S. at 623.)  It is because of this\n8 commitment to neutrality that legislative provisions which arbitrarily or irrationally create\n9 discrete classes cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 623.  “Equal\n10 protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.” \nt 11 Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 635 (1950) (quoting Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22\nr\nu\no\na 12 (1948)).  “The guaranty of ‘equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 laws.’”  Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (quoting Yick Wo v.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886)). \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 However, courts must balance this mandate with the “practical necessity that most\nS N 16 legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups\nted  For the  17 or persons.”  Romer, 517 U.S. at 631 (citations omitted).  The equal protection guarantee\ni\nn\nU\n18 preserves a measure of power to the state and the federal government to enact legislation that\n19 classifies certain groups.  Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256,\n20 271-72 (1979).  In an attempt to reconcile the promise of equal protection with the reality of\n21 lawmaking, courts apply the most searching constitutional scrutiny to those laws that burden a\n22 fundamental right or target a suspect class, such as those based on race, national origin, sex or\n23 religion.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 631.  To these groups of protected classifications, subject to a\n24 heightened scrutiny, the government is required to demonstrate that the classification is\n25 substantially related to an important governmental objective.  See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456,\n26 461 (1988).  Laws that do not burden a protected class or infringe on a constitutionally\n27 protected fundamental right are subject to rational basis review.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. \n28 Under the rational basis review, a law must be rationally related to the furtherance of a\n12\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page13 of 43\n1 legitimate governmental interest.  Id. (citing Heller v. Doe by Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-320\n2 (1993)).  \n3 In resolving an equal protection challenge, the Court “must first determine what\n4 classification has been created” by the legislation.  Aleman v. Glickman, 217 F.3d 1191, 1195\n5 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Lazy Y Ranch, 546 F.3d at 589.  The plaintiff must show that the “law\n6 is applied in a discriminatory manner or imposes different burdens on different classes of\n7 people.”  Lazy Y Ranch, 546 F.3d at 589 (quoting Freeman v. City of Santa Ana, 68 F.3d 1180,\n8 1187 (9th Cir. 1995)).  The Court must then ascertain the appropriate level of scrutiny to\n9 employ.  In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 142 (W.D. Wash. 2004).4\n10 1. Level of Scrutiny.\nt 11 Here, DOMA makes distinctions between legally married couples, by granting benefits\nr\nu\no\na 12 to opposite-sex married couples but denying benefits to same-sex married couples. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Accordingly, DOMA treats gay and lesbian individuals differently on the basis of their sexual\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 orientation.  In order to determine whether sexual orientation is considered a suspect or quasi-\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 suspect class entitled to heightened scrutiny, the Court must look at various factors.5  The\nS N 16\nited  For the  17 4  Ms. Golinski challenges the application of DOMA because it discriminates both on\nn\nthe basis of sex and on the basis of sexual orientation.  (Golinski Reply on Motion for\nU\n18 Summary Judgment at 7-8.)  Sexual orientation discrimination can take the form of sex\ndiscrimination.  See Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 996 (N.D. Cal. 2010)\n19 (“Perry”).  Here, for example, Ms. Golinski is prohibited from marrying Ms. Cunninghis, a\nwoman, because Ms. Golinski is a woman.  If Ms. Golinski were a man, DOMA would not\n20 serve to withhold benefits from her.  Thus, DOMA operates to restrict Ms. Golinski’s access\nto federal benefits because of her sex.  But DOMA also operates to restrict Ms. Golinski’s\n21 access to federal benefits because of her sexual orientation; her desire to marry another\nwoman arises only because she is a lesbian.  Accordingly, the Court addresses the Equal\n22 Protection challenge on the basis of sexual orientation.\n23 5  The question of whether DOMA impacts a fundamental right is addressed briefly by\nthe parties but it is not at issue here as it is undisputed that Ms. Golinski is already married\n24 under state law.  The failure of the federal government to recognize Ms. Golinski’s marriage\nand to provide benefits does not alter the fact that she is married under state law.  Thus,\n25 Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), which ostensibly addressed whether same-sex couples\nhave a constitutional right to marry, is irrelevant here.  See Perry v. Brown, ---  F.3d ---, 2012\n26 WL 372713, at *17 n.14 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Perry II”).\n27 However, it is established that there is a fundamental right to marry.  Planned\nParenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992) (“Our law\n28 affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation,\ncontraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.... These matters, involving\n13\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page14 of 43\n1 Supreme Court has considered: (1) the history of invidious discrimination against the class\n2 burdened by the legislation; (2) whether the characteristics that distinguish the class indicate a\n3 typical class member’s ability to contribute to society; (3) whether the distinguishing\n4 characteristics are “immutable” or beyond the class members’ control; and (4) the political\n5 power of the subject class.  See Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 887-88 (Iowa 2009)\n6 (collecting cases).\n7 No single factor for determining elevated scrutiny is dispositive.  See Massachusetts\n8 Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 321 (1976).  The presence of any of the factors is\n9 a signal that the particular classification is “more likely than others to reflect deep-seated\n10 prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some legitimate objective,” thus\nt 11 requiring heightened scrutiny.

Distinguishing High Tech Gays Finding on Standard of Review.\n2 Before the Court may assess the various factors that apply to determine the appropriate \n3 level of scrutiny to apply in this matter, the Court must address the holding in  High Tech Gays\n4 v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, which addresses the standard of review for\n5 classifications based on sexual orientation.  895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir. 1990).  In HighTech\n6 Gays, decided before the Supreme Court revised much of the underlying legal preconceptions\n7 upon which this case rests, the Ninth Circuit determined that the classification of homosexuals\n8 lacks the indicia of a suspect or quasi-suspect category.  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held\n9 that the government need only come forth with a rational basis to sustain its classifications\n10 against the gay and lesbian minority.  Id.\nt 11 However, the foundations of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in High Tech Gays have\nr\nu\no\na 12 sustained serious erosion by virtue of more recent decisions by the Supreme Court.  When the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 premise for a case’s holding has been weakened, the precedential import of the case is subject to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 question.  District courts are not governed by earlier appellate precedent that has been “undercut\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 by higher authority to such an extent that it has been effectively overruled by such higher\nS N 16 authority.”  Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).  \nted  For the  17 The linchpin of the reasoning in High Tech Gays was the precedent set by the Supreme\ni\nn\nU\n18 Court in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 190 (1986), which upheld the criminalization of\n19 private consensual homosexual conduct.  In High Tech Gays, the Ninth Circuit concluded that,\n20 based on the holding in Bowers, “because homosexual conduct can ... be criminalized,\n21 homosexuals cannot constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to greater than rational\n22 basis review for equal protection purposes.”  High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 571.  Pursuant to\n23 Supreme Court precedent in Bowers, the Ninth Circuit agreed that “it cannot logically be\n24 asserted that discrimination against homosexuals is constitutionally infirm.”  Id. at 571 n.6\n25 (quoting Woodward v. United States, 871 F.2d 1068, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).  The court\n26 concluded that, under the holding of Bowers, it would be anomalous to define the conduct of\n27 members of a class as criminal and also find that, as a class, they were deserving of strict or\n28\n15\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page16 of 43\n1 heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  See id. (citing Padula v. Webster, 822\n2 F.2d 97, 103 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n3 However, since the decision in High Tech Gays, the Supreme Court has overruled\n4 Bowers, renounced its fundamental premise, and found that “Bowers was not correct when it\n5 was decided, and it is not correct today.”  Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003).  The\n6 Lawrence Court found that majority’s moral condemnation of the intimate practices of\n7 homosexual partners does not justify criminal prohibition and found those private consensual\n8 practices are safeguarded by the liberty protections afforded by the Due Process Clause of the\n9 Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 574-75.  Therefore, the reasoning in High Tech Gays, that laws\n10 discriminating against gay men and lesbians are not entitled to heightened scrutiny because\nt 11 homosexual conduct may be legitimately criminalized, cannot stand post-Lawrence.  \nr\nu\no\na 12 In addition, the court in High Tech Gays, in performing the analysis of the issue of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 whether the legislature’s classification based on homosexuality calls for heightened scrutiny,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 relied on the mistaken assumption that sexual orientation is merely “behavioral,” rather than the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 sort of deeply rooted, immutable characteristic that warrants heightened protection from\nS N 16 discrimination.  See High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 573-74.  The court found that\nted  For the  17 “[h]omosexuality is not an immutable characteristic; it is behavioral and hence fundamentally\ni\nn\nU\n18 different from traits such as race, gender, or alienage, which define already existing suspect and\n19 quasi-suspect classes.  The behavior of such already recognized classes is irrelevant to their\n20 identification.”  Id. (internal citations omitted).  The Supreme Court has since rejected this\n21 artificial distinction, noting that its more recent precedent “have declined to distinguish between\n22 status and conduct in th[e] context” of sexual orientation.  See Christian Legal Society v.\n23 Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 2990 (2010).  In Lawrence, the Court noted that “[w]hen\n24 homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is\n25 an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination.”  539 U.S. at 575 (emphasis\n26 added); id. at 583 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (“While it is true that the law applies\n27 only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being\n28 homosexual.  Under such circumstances, [the] law is targeted at more than conduct.  It is instead\n16\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page17 of 43\n1 directed toward gay persons as a class.”).  Accordingly, the analysis of the Ninth Circuit in\n2 High Tech Gays on the appropriateness of applying heightened scrutiny to gay men and lesbians\n3 because their defining characteristic is immutable has been severely undermined by more recent\n4 and overriding precedent.\n5 The Court finds that the outdated holding in High Tech Gays, subjecting gay men and\n6 lesbians to rational basis review, is no longer a binding precedent.  See Miller, 335 F.3d at 900\n7 (finding that where an intervening decision of a higher court is clearly irreconcilable with a\n8 Ninth Circuit decision, “district courts should consider themselves bound by the intervening\n9 higher authority and reject the prior opinion of [the Ninth Circuit] as having been effectively\n10 overruled.”).\nt 11 3. The Question of Level of Scrutiny is Still Open.\nr\nu\no\na 12 The Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have yet to issue binding rulings as to whether\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 classifications based on sexual orientation are suspect (or quasi-suspect).  See Romer, 517 U.S.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 at 620, 632-33 (finding that it was unnecessary to look beyond rational basis review because the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 state’s attempt to strip gay people of all anti-discrimination protections was “a denial of equal\nS N 16 protection in the most literal sense” and because it “confound[ed] and defie[d]” rational basis\nted  For the  17 review.”); see also, e.g., Diaz v. Brewer, 656 F.3d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir. 2011) (“We do not need\ni\nn\nU\n18 to decide whether heightened scrutiny might be required.”); In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at 931\n19 (finding that although it is “likely that some form of heightened constitutional scrutiny applies\n20 ... [, because] the denial of benefits here cannot survive even rational basis review, the least\n21 searching form of constitutional scrutiny ... it is not necessary to determine whether or which\n22 form of heightened scrutiny is applicable to this claim.”); Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *17\n23 (finding that, as in Romer, the court need not apply heightened scrutiny where the proposed\n24 legislation fails rational basis scrutiny); Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d at 1189 (“Because the\n25 Court finds that Plaintiffs state a claim under the rational basis standard, the question of whether\n26 Plaintiffs are members of a protected class need not be resolved here.”).  The majority of the\n27 Supreme Court in Lawrence, although it declared unconstitutional the laws infringing on the\n28 substantive liberty shared by gay people to engage in sexual intimacy, did not directly address\n17\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page18 of 43\n1 what standard of review applies to the classification of gay and lesbian individuals.  Lawrence,\n2 539 U.S. at 558.  And the Ninth Circuit in Witt v. Department of Air Force merely found, in the\n3 context of military policy where judicial deference “is at its apogee,” that the military’s policy\n4 of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” would fail even rational basis review.  527 F.3d 806, 821 (9th Cir.\n5 2008).\n6 Because Lawrence overturned Bowers and in light of the lack of precedential value of\n7 High Tech Gays, no federal appellate court has meaningfully examined the appropriate level of\n8 scrutiny to apply to gay men and lesbians.  Therefore, the Court finds the question of what level\n9 of scrutiny applies to classifications based on sexual orientation is still open.\n10 4. Heightened Scrutiny Should Apply.\nt 11 The Court undertakes to analyze the factors required to demonstrate whether a particular\nr\nu\no\na 12 class is entitled to suspect or quasi-suspect status and therefore deserving of heightened\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 scrutiny.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a. History of discrimination against gay men and lesbians.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The first factor courts consider is whether the class has suffered a history of\nS N 16 discrimination.  There is no dispute in the record that lesbians and gay men have experienced a\nted  For the  17 long history of discrimination.  (See Declaration of George Chauncey at ¶¶ 6-103; OPM Opp.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Br. at 6-13.)  There is also no dispute that courts have found that gay men and lesbians have\n19 experienced a history of discrimination.  See, e.g., High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 573\n20 (acknowledging that “homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination”); Witt, 527 F.3d\n21 at 824-25 (noting that homosexuals have “experienced a history of purposeful unequal\n22 treatment”); Perry v. Proposition 8 Official Proponents, 587 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir. 2009)\n23 (addressing the difficulty in denying that gay men and lesbians have experienced discrimination\n24 in the past in light of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in High Tech Gays); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at\n25 981-82 (acknowledging extensive evidence of public and private discrimination against gay\n26 men and lesbians in California and throughout the United States); see also In re Balas, 449 B.R.\n27 567, 576 (Bankr.

Ability to contribute to society.\n2 Similarly, there is no dispute in the record or the law that sexual orientation has no\n3 relevance to a person’s ability to contribute to society.  See Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699,\n4 725 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Sexual orientation plainly has no relevance to a person’s ability to\n5 perform or contribute to society.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at\n6 1002 (concluding that “by every available metric, opposite-sex couples are not better than their\n7 same-sex counterparts; instead, as partners, parents and citizens, opposite-sex couples and\n8 same-sex couples are equal.”).  \n9 c. Defining or immutable characteristics.\n10 Another consideration courts find relevant in determining whether statutory provisions\nt 11 pertaining to a particular group are subject to heightened scrutiny includes whether the\nr\nu\no\na 12 characteristic that defines the members of the class as a discrete group is immutable or\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 otherwise not within the members’ control.  See Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Ms. Golinski presents evidence that the characteristic of sexual orientation is immutable\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 or highly resistant to change.

Demographic, Psychological, and Social\n19 Characteristics of Self-Identified Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults, 7, 176-200 (2010) (noting\n20 that in a national survey, 95 percent of gay men and 83 percent of lesbian women reported that\n21 they experienced “no choice at all” or “very little choice” about their sexual orientation); see\n22 also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 966 (“No credible evidence supports a finding that an individual\n23 may, through conscious decision, therapeutic intervention or any other method, change his or\n24 her sexual orientation.”)\n25 BLAG presents evidence demonstrating that there is some fluidity on the continuum of\n26 sexuality for some individuals who identify themselves as gay or lesbian.  (See Declaration of\n27 Conor B. Dugan (“Dugan Decl.”), Ex. B at 36:14-38, Ex. 4, Ex. E at 320.)  The evidence\n28 indicates that a very small minority of the gay and lesbian population may experience a small\n19\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page20 of 43\n1 amount of choice in their sexuality.  (Id.)  However, the vast majority of those who self-reported\n2 as gay or lesbian did not experience attraction to the opposite sex at any time.  (See Further\n3 Declaration of Letitia Anne Peplau at ¶ 6 (“data show that only 1/2 of 1% of the male\n4 participants and 1.3% of the female participants shifted from only opposite sex attraction to\n5 major attraction to the same sex or vice versa.”)).  \n6 However, regardless of the evidence that a tiny percentage of gay men or lesbians may\n7 experience some flexibility along the continuum of their sexuality or the scientific consensus\n8 that sexual orientation is unchangeable, the Court finds persuasive the holding in the Ninth\n9 Circuit that sexual orientation is recognized as a defining and immutable characteristic because\n10 it is so fundamental to one’s identity.  “Sexual orientation and sexual identity are immutable;\nt 11 they are so fundamental to one’s identity that a person should not be required to abandon them.” \nr\nu\no\na 12 Hernandez-Montiel v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 225 F.3d 1084, 1093 (9th Cir.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 2000), overruled in part on other grounds by Thomas v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 2005); see also Karouni v. Gonzales, 399 F.3d 1163, 1173 (9th Cir. 2005) (agreeing with\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Hernandez-Montiel and finding that homosexuality is “a fundamental aspect of ... human\nS N 16 identity”); Watkins, 875 F.2d at 726 (Norris, J., concurring) (finding that the prong of\nted  For the  17 suspectness inquiry is satisfied when the identifying trait is “so central to a person’s identity\ni\nn\nU\n18 that it would be abhorrent for government to penalize a person for refusing to change [it]”); In\n19 re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal.4th 757, 842 (2008) (“Because a person’s sexual orientation is so\n20 integral an aspect of one’s identity, it is not appropriate to require a person to repudiate or\n21 change his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid discriminatory treatment.”)  The Court\n22 finds that a person’s sexual orientation is so fundamental to one’s identity that a person should\n23 not be required to abandon it.  Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of the application of\n24 heightened scrutiny.6\n25\n26 6  In addition, immutability is not an absolute prerequisite to heightened scrutiny.  The\nSupreme Court has granted suspect class status to groups whose distinguishing characteristic\n27 is not immutable.  See, e.g., Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9 n.11 (1977) (rejecting\nimmutability requirements in treating group of resident aliens as suspect class despite their\n28 ability to opt out of class voluntarily); see also Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 431 (1998)\n(recognizing that because a child born out of wedlock may be “legitimated” by father, strictly\n20\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page21 of 43\n1 d. Minority status and political powerlessness.\n2 The final consideration employed by courts to determine whether a subject group\n3 deserves heightened constitutional scrutiny is whether the subject group is “a minority or\n4 politically powerless.”  Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987); see also San Antonio\n5 Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973) (concluding that a class\n6 comprising poor families exhibits none of the “traditional indicia of suspectness” because class\n7 is not “saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal\n8 treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command\n9 extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”)  This factor examines relative\n10 political power and seeks to answer the question whether the “discrimination is unlikely to be\nt 11 soon rectified by legislative means.”  City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.7  \nr\nu\no\na 12 There is no dispute in the record that gay men and lesbians are a minority of the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 population in the United States.  (See Dugan Decl., Ex. A at 13:12-14, Ex. B at 19:2-7.)  The\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 only issue is whether the minority is politically vulnerable or lacking in power.  The Court has\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 reviewed the evidence submitted by the parties for consideration on this factor.  \nS N 16 BLAG argues that the current Administration’s reversal of position with regard to\nted  For the  17 defending DOMA in various courts nationwide is evidence that gay and lesbian individuals\ni\nn\nU\n18 have achieved political power.  BLAG contends that the decision followed President Obama’s\n19 receipt of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign seeking to change the Administration’s\n20 position.  (BLAG Opp. Br. at 12.)  However, this contention is not supported by the evidence in\n21\nspeaking illegitimacy is not an immutable characteristic); see also New Orleans v. Dukes,\n22 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam) (finding religious identification and alienage, despite\nbeing changeable, to constitute suspect classes). \n23\n7  In High Tech Gays, the Ninth Circuit briefly addressed the factor of political\n24 powerlessness:  “legislatures have addressed and continue to address the discrimination\nsuffered by homosexuals on account of their sexual orientation through the passage of anti-\n25 discrimination legislation.  Thus, homosexuals are not without political power; they have the\nability to and do ‘attract the attention of lawmakers,’ as evidenced by such legislation.”  895\n26 F.2d at 574 (citing City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445).  However, the very circumstance of\ngay men and lesbians being required to defend their interests against legislative action is a\n27 reflection of relative political weakness.  (Declaration of Gary Segura (“Segura Decl.”) at ¶\n14.)  In addition, the standard is not whether a minority group is entirely powerless, but\n28 rather whether they suffer from relative political weakness.  See Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 28;\nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.\n21\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page22 of 43\n1 the record.  First, this letter was sent nearly two years prior to the announcement of the\n2 Administration’s current opinion.  (Lin Reply Decl., Ex. H at 166:16-167:13.)  Second, the\n3 Department of Justice functions under an independent obligation to assess the constitutionality\n4 of a statute it has been tasked to defend.  By its own terms, the announcement by the\n5 Department of Justice was based not on a political calculation, but rather was an independent\n6 assessment of the constitutionality of DOMA.  (See NSA, Ex. 1 at 1-2.)   The contention that a\n7 two-year-old letter from a gay rights advocacy group was the pivotal consideration in the\n8 Administration’s reassessment of the law or that it demonstrates that gay men and lesbians have\n9 political power is speculative at best. \n10 BLAG also argues that a “spate of recent news stories only confirms the conclusion that\nt 11 homosexuals are far from politically powerless.”  (BLAG Opp. Br. at 12.)  BLAG lists the\nr\nu\no\na 12 nomination of four openly-gay judges, the laws in several states legalizing gay marriage, and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the campaign against Proposition 8 in California which garnered significant funding from\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 proponents of same-sex marriage.  (Id. at 12-15.)\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The recent articles BLAG cites are exceptions and not the rule.  While President Obama\nS N 16 nominated four openly-gay judges, there are literally hundreds of federal judges nationwide. \nted  For the  17 Only a handful of states have successfully passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage, and\ni\nn\nU\n18 only a few more have been required to afford equal marital rights to gay and lesbian individuals\n19 through judicial decisions.  Thirty states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-\n20 sex marriage.  (See OPM Opp. Br. at 15, citing National Conference of State Legislatures,\n21 Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships, available\n22 at http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid_16430 (last updated February 13, 2012)).  In contrast,\n23 when the Supreme Court ruled in Loving, interracial marriage was legal in thirty-four states. \n24 See Loving, 388 U.S. at 6.  Moreover, there is no federal anti-discrimination legislation and no\n25 protection in most states from sexual orientation discrimination.  (See OPM Opp. Br. at 6-12.) \n26 Finally, while the campaign against Proposition 8 may have raised significant funds, the\n27 majority of Californians still voted to alter the state constitution to strip gay and lesbian\n28\n22\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page23 of 43\n1 individuals of their rights.  Placed in context, BLAG’s evidence does not create a question of\n2 fact.  \n3 Despite the modest successes in remediating existing discrimination, the record\n4 demonstrates that gay men and lesbians continue to suffer discrimination “unlikely to be\n5 rectified by legislative means.”  City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.  Even BLAG, in similar\n6 litigation, has admitted that “gay men and lesbians often must rely on judicial decisions to\n7 secure equal rights.”  (Lin Reply Decl., Exs. C and D at ¶ 32.)  Ms. Golinski proffers the\n8 undisputed and extensive expert testimony of Gary Segura for the proposition that gay men and\n9 lesbians lack a meaningful degree of political power.  (See Segura Decl. at ¶¶ 9-85.)  In sum, the\n10 basic inability to bring about an end to discrimination and pervasive prejudice, to secure desired\nt 11 policy outcomes and to prevent undesirable outcomes on fundamental matters that directly\nr\nu\no\na 12 impact their lives, is evidence of the relative political powerlessness of gay and lesbian\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 individuals.  (Id. at ¶ 28.)  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Ms. Golinski also proffers the letter from the Attorney General to Congress regarding\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 DOMA and the Department of Justice’s determination that it would no longer provide a defense\nS N 16 of a statute which it considered to be unconstitutional.  (See NSA, Ex. 2.)  In the letter, the\nted  For the  17 Attorney General, speaking on behalf of the Executive, notes that “the adoption of the laws like\ni\nn\nU\n18 those at issue in Romer and Lawrence, the longstanding ban on gay men and lesbians in the\n19 military, and the absence of federal protection for employment discrimination on the basis of\n20 sexual orientation show the group to have limited political power and ‘ability to attract the\n21 [favorable] attention of the lawmakers.’”  (Id. at 2, citing City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.) \n22 The Court finds that the unequivocal evidence demonstrates that, although not\n23 completely politically powerless, the gay and lesbian community lacks meaningful political\n24 power.  In 1985, in their dissent from a petition for writ of certiorari, Justices Brennan and\n25 Marshall found that “homosexuals constitute a significant and insular minority of this country’s\n26 population.  Because of the immediate and severe opprobrium often manifested against\n27 homosexuals once so identified publicly, members of this group are particularly powerless to\n28 pursue their rights openly in the political arena.”  Rowland v. Mad River Local School District,\n23\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page24 of 43\n1 470 U.S. 1009, 1014 (1985).  The Court agrees and finds that, as a class, gay men and lesbians\n2 are a minority and have relatively limited political power to attract the favorable attention of\n3 lawmakers.  See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.  Although this factor is not an absolute\n4 prerequisite for heightened scrutiny, the Court finds the evidence and the law support the\n5 conclusion that gay men and lesbians remain a politically vulnerable minority.  See Plyler, 457\n6 U.S. at 216 n.14; Murgia, 427 U.S. at 321.\n7 Here, having analyzed the factors, the Court holds that the appropriate level of scrutiny\n8 to use when reviewing statutory classifications based on sexual orientation is heightened\n9 scrutiny.  See also In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at 931 (holding that “some form of heightened\n10 constitutional scrutiny applies”); Witt, 527 F. 3d at 824-25 (Canby, J., concurring in part and\nt 11 dissenting in part) (“classifications against homosexuals are suspect in the equal protection\nr\nu\no\na 12 sense” as gay and lesbian individuals have “experienced a history of purposeful unequal\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 treatment [and] been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 not truly indicative of their abilities” and “they also exhibit obvious, immutable, or\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group; and they are a minority.”).

See id. at 825.\ni\nn\nU\n18 5. Application of Heightened Scrutiny to Justifications Proffered for DOMA.\n19 Under heightened scrutiny, the proponents of the statute must establish, at a minimum,\n20 that the classification is “substantially related to an important governmental objective.”  Clark,\n21 486 U.S. at 461.  Moreover, under any form of heightened scrutiny, the statute may only be\n22 defended by reference to the actual legislative bases advanced to legitimate the statute or the\n23 “actual [governmental] purpose, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently grounded.” \n24 United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 535-36 (1996).  The Court notes that the “historical\n25 background of the decision” to enact legislation and the “specific sequence of events leading up\n26 to the challenged decision” may shed light on the decisionmakers’ purposes.  See Village of\n27 Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977). \n28 Here, the legislative history is replete with expressed animus toward gay men and lesbians.\n24\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page25 of 43\n1 The House Report on DOMA reflected Congress’ “moral disapproval of homosexuality,\n2 and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-\n3 Christian) morality.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-664 at 16 (footnote omitted).  In his expression of\n4 these objectives, Henry Hyde, then-Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, stated that\n5 “[m]ost people do not approve of homosexual conduct ... and they express their disapprobation\n6 through the law.”  142 Cong. Rec. H7480 (daily ed. July 12, 1996).\n7 In the floor debate, members of Congress repeatedly expressed their disapprobation of\n8 homosexuality, calling it “immoral,” “depraved,” “unnatural,” “based on perversion,” and “an\n9 attack upon God’s principles.”  142 Cong. Rec. H7444 (daily ed. July 11, 1996) (statement of\n10 Rep. Coburn); 142 Cong. Rec. H7486 (daily ed. July 12, 1996) (statement of Rep. Buyer); id. at\nt 11 H7494 (statement of Rep. Smith).  Members of Congress argued that marriage by gay men and\nr\nu\no\na 12 lesbians would “demean” and “trivialize” heterosexual marriage and might indeed be “the final\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 blow to the American family.”  142 Cong. Rec. H7276 (daily ed. July 11, 1996) (statement of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Rep. Largent); 142 Cong. Rec. H7495 (daily ed. July 12, 1996) (statement of Rep. Lipinski)\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 (“Allowing for gay marriages would be the final straw, it would devaluate the love between a\nS N 16 man and a woman and weaken us as a Nation.”).  Senator Helms, in a statement prepared for the\nted  For the  17 hearing, expressed his disapprobation:  “[Those opposed to DOMA] are demanding that\ni\nn\nU\n18 homosexuality be considered as just another lifestyle – these are the people who seek to force\n19 their agenda upon the vast majority of Americans who reject the homosexual lifestyle ... \n20 Homosexuals and lesbians boast that they are close to realizing their goal – legitimizing their\n21 behavior ...  At the heart of this debate is the moral and spiritual survival of this Nation.”  142\n22 Cong. Rec. S10,110 (daily ed. Sept. 10, 1996); see also 142 Cong. Rec. H7275 (daily ed. July\n23 11, 1996) (statement of Rep. Barr) (stating that marriage is “under direct assault by the\n24 homosexual extremists all across the country.”).  The House Report on the pending DOMA bill\n25 stated:  “Civil laws that permit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a collective moral\n26 judgment about human sexuality.  This judgment entails [a] moral disapproval of\n27 homosexuality.”  H.R. Rep. 104-664, at 15-16.  The Report further stated that “same-sex\n28\n25\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page26 of 43\n1 marriage, if sanctified by the law, if approved by the law, legitimates a public union, a legal\n2 status that most people ... feel ought to be illegitimate.”  Id. at 16.\n3 Despite the expressed animus against gay men and lesbians within the legislative history\n4 of DOMA, Congress also specifically identified four governmental interests to be advanced by\n5 the statute:  (1) encouraging responsible procreation and child-rearing; (2) defending and\n6 nurturing the institution of traditional, heterosexual marriage; (3) defending traditional notions\n7 of morality; and (4) preserving scarce government resources.  See H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at\n8 12-18. \n9 a. Responsible procreation and child-rearing.\n10 The first reason proffered by Congress when enacting DOMA was to encourage\nt 11 responsible procreation and child-rearing.  \nr\nu\no\na 12 Ms. Golinski presents evidence that it is “beyond scientific dispute” that same-sex\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 parents are equally capable at parenting as opposite-sex parents.  (See Declaration of Michael\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Lamb (“Lamb Decl.”) at ¶ 14.)  The evidence presented by Professor Lamb demonstrates that\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 parents’ genders are irrelevant to children’s developmental outcomes.  (See id. at ¶¶ 28, 38;\nS N 16 Reply Declaration of Michael Lamb (“Lamb Reply Decl.”) at ¶¶ 8, 19, 28.)  More than thirty\nted  For the  17 years of scholarship resulting in over fifty peer-reviewed empirical reports have\ni\nn\nU\n18 overwhelmingly demonstrated that children raised by same-sex parents are as likely to be\n19 emotionally healthy, and educationally and socially successful as those raised by opposite-sex\n20 parents.  (See Lamb Decl. at ¶¶ 29-32.)  “There is ... no empirical support for the notion that the\n21 presence of both male and female role models in the home promotes children’s adjustment or\n22 well-being.”  (Id. at ¶ 14.)  “Since the enactment of DOMA, a consensus has developed among\n23 the medical, psychological and social welfare communities that children raised by gay and\n24 lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents.” \n25 Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 388; see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1000 (“The evidence does not\n26 support a finding that California has an interest in preferring opposite-sex parents over same-\n27 sex parents.  Indeed, the evidence shows beyond any doubt that parents’ genders are irrelevant\n28 to children’s developmental outcomes.”); Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 899 n.26 (“The research\n26\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page27 of 43\n1 appears to strongly support the conclusion that same-sex couples foster the same wholesome\n2 environment as opposite-sex couples and suggests that the traditional notion that children need\n3 a mother and a father to be raised into healthy, well-adjusted adults is based more on stereotype\n4 than anything else.”).  \n5 BLAG argues that there are flaws in the studies proffered by Ms. Golinski’s expert,\n6 Professor Lamb, comparing gay or lesbian parents to opposite-sex parents, based on\n7 methodological challenges.  The first alleged flaw is that there have been fewer studies of gay\n8 male parents than there have been of lesbian family research.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 7; see\n9 also Lin Reply Decl., Ex. K at 76:6-17.)  Whether this is the case does not impact the validity of\n10 the studies performed.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 8.)  The second flaw as argued by BLAG is\nt 11 that there are fewer studies on adolescents than on younger children.  However, it remains\nr\nu\no\na 12 undisputed that “there are several ... studies that have looked at adolescent offspring living with\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 same-sex parents” and those studies have “uniformly reported positive outcomes.”  (See id. at\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 ¶¶ 9-10; see also Lin Reply Decl., Ex. K at 82:15-83:21.)  The third criticism is that Professor\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Lamb indicates the need for further studies.  This does not impact the validity of the studies\nS N 16 already performed.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 12.)  The Court finds that these criticisms of the\nted  For the  17 studies relied upon by Professor Lamb do not alter their validity.  “[A]t the summary judgment\ni\nn\nU\n18 stage the judge’s function is not ... to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter\n19 but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249. \n20 The Court finds BLAG’s critique does not create an issue of fact.\n21 Further, BLAG cites three sources for the proposition that same-sex parenting is inferior\n22 to opposite-sex parenting.  One is an article from Slate.com in which the author contends that\n23 the existing science is methodologically flawed and ideologically skewed.  (See Ann Hulbert,\n24 The Gay Science:  What Do We Know About the Effects of Same-Sex Parenting?, Slate (Mar.\n25 12, 2004), available at http://www.slate.com/id/2097048/.)  This is a three-page, non-scientific\n26 article by an author with no professional expertise in child development, published by a popular\n27 online magazine without peer review.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 15.)  Another reference by\n28 BLAG is an article criticizing the sampling size in the studies relied upon by Professor Lamb. \n27\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page28 of 43\n1 As Professor Lamb explains, such sampling is typical of psychological research and a number\n2 of the studies he relied upon do use representative sampling.  (See id. at ¶ 16.)  The last source\n3 is an unpublished piece by Professor Loren Marks in which he criticizes a brief issued by the\n4 American Psychological Association in 2005 concluding that social science research indicates\n5 that gay parents provide a home environment equally likely to support children’s psychological\n6 and social growth.  (See BLAG Opp. Br., Ex. 2.)  The critique is neither a study nor published\n7 in a peer-reviewed journal and its questionable analysis is based on outdated and selectively-\n8 chosen data.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶¶ 20-27.)  The piece also ignores many of the studies\n9 relied upon by Professor Lamb regarding the conclusion that parents’ sexual orientation is\n10 unrelated to their children’s adjustment.  (See id. at ¶¶ 21-27.)  Having reviewed the evidence\nt 11 presented, the Court concludes that all three publications merely criticize the studies relied upon\nr\nu\no\na 12 Professor Lamb.  As stated above, the criticism merely goes to the weight of Ms. Golinski’s\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 evidence.  The publications do not present any independent affirmative evidence necessary to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 create a genuine issue of disputed fact regarding whether same-sex married couples function as\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 responsible parents.  \nS N 16 Furthermore, to the extent Congress was interested merely in encouraging responsible\nted  For the  17 procreation and child-rearing by opposite-sex married couples, a desire to encourage opposite-\ni\nn\nU\n18 sex couples to procreate and raise their own children well would not provide a legitimate reason\n19 for denying federal recognition of same-sex marriages.  The denial of recognition and\n20 withholding of marital benefits to same-sex couples does nothing to support opposite-sex\n21 parenting, but rather merely serves to endanger children of same-sex parents by denying them\n22 “‘the immeasurable advantages that flow from the assurance of a stable family structure,’ when\n23 afforded equal recognition under federal law.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 389 (quoting Goodridge\n24 v. Department of Public Health, 440 Mass. 309, 335 (2003)).  It is undisputed that same-sex\n25 parents can and do have and adopt children.  The denial of federal recognition of valid same-sex\n26 marriages under state law does not alter parental rights under state law.  Rather, the passage of\n27 DOMA only serves to undermine providing a stable environment for children of same-sex\n28 married couples whose children would otherwise be raised in a household bestowed with all of\n28\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page29 of 43\n1 the federal benefits of marriage, including financial support and social recognition.  (See Lamb\n2 Decl. at ¶ 42.)\n3 Furthermore, an interest in promoting procreation within marriage cannot provide a\n4 legitimate reason to exclude same-sex marriages from federal recognition.  The ability to\n5 procreate cannot and has never been a precondition to marriage.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605\n6 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating “what justification could there possibly be for denying the\n7 benefits of marriage to homosexual couples ... [s]urely not the encouragement of procreation,\n8 since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry”).  “While it is certainly true that many,\n9 perhaps most, married couples have children together (assisted or unassisted), it is the exclusive\n10 and permanent commitment of the marriage partners to one another, not the begetting of\nt 11 children, that is the sine qua non of civil marriage.”  Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d at 1190 (citing\nr\nu\no\na 12 Goodridge, 440 Mass. at 332).  The federal government has never considered withdrawing its\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 recognition of marriage based on an ability or inability to procreate.  See id.; see also Gill, 699\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 F. Supp. 2d at 389.  Even if this could be considered a legitimate interest, denying federal\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 recognition of and withholding federal benefits from legally married same-sex couples does\nS N 16 nothing to encourage or discourage opposite-sex couples from having children within marriage.\nted  For the  17 Accordingly, the Court finds that the first proffered reason for the passage of DOMA –\ni\nn\nU\n18 to encourage responsible procreation and child-rearing – does not provide a justification that is\n19 substantially related to an important governmental objective.\n20 b. Nurturing the institution of traditional, opposite-sex marriage.\n21 The second reason proffered by Congress when passing DOMA, was its asserted interest\n22 in defending and nurturing traditional, opposite-sex marriage.  Tradition alone, however, cannot\n23 form an adequate justification for a law.  See Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 239 (1970);\n24 Romer, 517 U.S. at 635; Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 579.  The “ancient lineage” of a classification\n25 does not render it legitimate.  Heller, 509 U.S. at 327.  Instead, the government must have an\n26 interest separate and apart from the fact of tradition itself.  \n27 In addition, the ostensible governmental objective of fostering opposite-sex marriages\n28 remains unaffected by the passage of DOMA.  DOMA does nothing to encourage same-sex\n29\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page30 of 43\n1 married individuals to marry members of the opposite sex because they are already married to a\n2 member of the same sex.  Nor does the denial of benefits to same-sex couples do anything to\n3 encourage opposite-sex couples to get married.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 389; see also In re\n4 Levenson, 587 F.3d at 932 (“gays and lesbians will not be encouraged to enter into marriages\n5 with members of the opposite sex by the government’s denial of benefits to same-sex spouses,\n6 and the denial will not discourage same-sex couples from entering into same-sex marriages; so,\n7 the denial cannot be said to ‘nurture’ or ‘defend’ the institution of heterosexual marriage.”); see\n8 also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 972 (“Permitting same-sex couples to marry will not affect the\n9 number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage\n10 or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages.”).\nt 11 Accordingly, the Court does not find that the second proffered reason for the passage of\nr\nu\no\na 12 DOMA – to defend and nurture the institution of traditional, opposite-sex marriage – provides a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 justification that is substantially related to an important governmental objective.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 c. Defending traditional notions of morality.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The third reason proffered by Congress when passing DOMA was its asserted interest in \nS N 16 defending traditional notions of morality.  Basing legislation on moral disapproval of same-sex\nted  For the  17 couples does not pass any level of scrutiny.  “The animus toward, and moral rejection of,\ni\nn\nU\n18 homosexuality and same-sex relationships are apparent in the Congressional record.”  See\n19 Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d at 1190.  “[M]oral condemnation of homosexuality [does not]\n20 provide the requisite justification for the DOMA’s section three.  The ‘bare desire to harm a\n21 politically unpopular group’ is not a legitimate [governmental] interest.”  Id. (quoting Romer,\n22 517 U.S. at 634-35).  The condemnation of homosexuality as immoral \n23 has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable\nbehavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not\n24 trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral\nprinciples to which they aspire and which thus determ ine the course of t heir\n25 lives. ... The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the [government]\nto enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the ... law.\n26\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 571.  The Court concludes it can not.  The imposition of subjective moral\n27\nbeliefs of a majority upon a minority cannot provide a justification for the legislation.  The\n28\nobligation of the Court is “to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.” \n30\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page31 of 43\n1 Casey, 505 U.S. at 850.  “Moral disapproval of a group cannot be a legitimate governmental\n2 interest under the Equal Protection Clause because legal classifications must not be ‘drawn for\n3 the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.’”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 582\n4 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 633).  “[T]he fact that the governing\n5 majority ... has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason\n6 for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law\n7 prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577-78.\n8 Accordingly, the Court does not find that the third proffered reason for the passage of\n9 DOMA – to defend traditional notions of morality – provides a justification that is substantially\n10 related to an important governmental objective.\nt 11 d. Preserving scarce government resources.\nr\nu\no\na 12 The final reason proffered by Congress for passing DOMA was the preservation of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 scarce government resources.  However, there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the provision of federal benefits to same-sex married couples would adversely affect the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 government fisc.  In addition, the preservation of government resources cannot, as a matter of\nS N 16 law, justify barring some arbitrarily chosen group from a government program.  Plyler, 457\nted  For the  17 U.S. at 227, 229.  “[A]lhough efficacious administration of governmental programs is not\ni\nn\nU\n18 without some importance, ‘the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and\n19 efficiency.’”  Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690 (1973) (citing Stanley v. Illinois, 405\n20 U.S. 645, 656 (1972)).  Under heightened scrutiny, convenience and economic efficiency in the\n21 administration of governmental programs do not legitimize differential treatment.  See id. at\n22 690-91.\n23 Accordingly, the Court does not find that the fourth proffered reason for the passage of\n24 DOMA – to preserve scarce government resources – provides a justification that is substantially\n25 related to an important governmental objective.\n26 The Court concludes that, based on the justifications proffered by Congress for its\n27 passage of DOMA, the statute fails to satisfy heightened scrutiny and is unconstitutional as\n28 applied to Ms. Golinski.\n31\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page32 of 43\n1 D. In the Alternative, DOMA Fails Under Rational Basis Review.\n2 Although the Court finds that DOMA is subject to and fails to satisfy heightened\n3 scrutiny, it notes that numerous courts have found that the statute fails even rational basis\n4 review.\n5 1. Standards for Rational Basis Scrutiny.  \n6 Where a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, a court shall\n7 uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end. \n8 Heller, 509 U.S. at 319-320.  Under the rational basis standard of review, legislative enactments\n9 are accorded a strong presumption of validity.  Id.  Courts “are compelled under rational-basis\n10 review to accept a legislature’s generalizations even where there is an imperfect fit between\nt 11 means and ends.”  Id. (internal citations omitted).  Indeed, a court applying rational basis review\nr\nu\no\na 12 may “go so far as to hypothesize about potential motivations of the legislature, in order to find a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 legitimate government interest sufficient to justify the challenged provision.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 2d at 387 (citing Shaw v. Oregon Public Employees’ Retirement Board, 887 F.2d 947, 948-49\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 (9th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation omitted)).  “In areas of social and economic policy, a\nS N 16 statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental\nted  For the  17 constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably\ni\nn\nU\n18 conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.”  FCC v.\n19 Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993).  Rational basis review is “a paradigm\n20 of judicial restraint” and “is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of\n21 legislative choices.”  Id. at 313-14.  “Nor does it authorize ‘the judiciary [to] sit as a\n22 superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in\n23 areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines.’”  Heller, 509 U.S.\n24 at 319 (quoting Dukes, 427 U.S. at 303).  \n25 “‘[T]he burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who\n26 assails it.’”  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 266 (1962) (quoting Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v.\n27 Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 584 (1935)).  The burden is to “‘negative every conceivable basis\n28 which might support it,’ whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.”  Heller, 509\n32\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page33 of 43\nU.S. at 320-21 (quoting Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 364 (1973)). \n1\n“A classification does not fail rational-basis review because it ‘is not made with mathematical\n2\nnicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.’”  Id. at 321 (quoting Dandridge v.\n3\nWilliams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970)).  “The problems of government are practical ones and may\n4\njustify, if they do not require, rough accommodations – illogical, it may be, and unscientific.” \n5\nId. (citing Metropolis Theatre Co. v. City of Chicago, 228 U.S. 61, 69-70 (1913)).  “A statutory\n6\ndiscrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify\n7\nit.”  Id. (citing McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961)).  \n8\nHowever, rational review is not “toothless.”  Mathews v. de Castro, 429 U.S. 181, 185\n9\n(1976).  “A statutory classification fails rational-basis review only when it ‘rests on grounds\n10\nwholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State’s objective.’”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 324\nt 11\nr\nu\no (quoting Holt Civic Club v.

Supp. 2d at 387 (quoting\n19\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 633).  Lastly, the justification for the law may not rely on factual\n20\nassumptions that exceed the bounds of rational speculation.  Lewis v. Thompson, 252 F.3d 567,\n21\n590 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Heller, 509 U.S. at 320 (holding that speculation, while permissible,\n22\nmust be “rational”)).  \n23\nWhen applying rational basis review to a classification that adversely affects an\n24\nunpopular group, courts apply a “more searching” rational basis review.  Diaz, 656 F.3d at\n25\n1012.  With these protections, courts may thereby “ensure that classifications are not drawn for\n26\nthe purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.”  Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (citing\n27\nRailroad Retirement Board v.

Application of Rational Basis Review to Justifications Proffered by\nCongress.\n4\nThe Court has already addressed the four interests proffered by Congress during the\n5\npassage of DOMA and found them not to be substantially related to an important governmental\n6\nobjective.  Similarly, under the rational basis review, the Court finds that none of Congress’\n7\nproffered justifications constitute a rational relation in furtherance of some legitimate\n8\ngovernmental end.  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 631 (citing Heller, 509 U.S. at 319-320).  \n9\nSpecifically, the Court finds that Congress’ justification of promoting traditional notions\n10\nof morality does not satisfy rational basis scrutiny.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 582 (holding that\nt 11\nr\nu “[m]oral disapproval of [homosexuals], like a bare desire to harm the group, is an interest that is\no\na 12\nC ni\n  or insufficient to satisfy rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause.”)  Also, if the\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  denial of benefits is designed to defend traditional notions of morality by discouraging same-sex\n Dis District  14 marriage, “it does so only by punishing same-sex couples who exercise their rights under state\ntates orthern  15 law, and thus exhibits the ‘bare desire to harm’ same-sex couples.”  In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 932 (emphasis in original).  This is forbidden by the Constitution.  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 634-\ni\nn 35.  “Discouraging gay marriage serves only to force gay couples to live in a ‘state of sin’ rather\nU\n18\nthan in a lawfully-recognized ‘state of connubial bliss’ that encourages a long-enduring\n19\npermanent relationship that, in turn, serves as the basis of a state-recognized family.”  In re\n20\nLevenson, 587 F.3d at 932.  The promotion of morality is not a cognizable governmental\n21\ninterest furthered by the denial of federal benefits and protections.\n22\nSimilarly, the Court does not find the justification of preserving the government fisc\n23\nsatisfies rational basis review.  See Lyng v. International Union, 485 U.S. 360, 376-77 (1988)\n24\n(holding that previous cases make “clear that something more than an invocation of the public\n25\nfisc is necessary to demonstrate the rationality of selecting [one group], rather than some other\n26\ngroup, to suffer the burden of cost-cutting legislation.”).  Ostensible savings to the government\n27\n28\n34\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page35 of 43\n1 fisc that depends upon “distinguishing between homosexual and heterosexual [couples],\n2 similarly situated, ... cannot survive rational basis review.”  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1014.8  \n3 a. Responsible procreation and child-rearing.\n4 In arguing its defense of DOMA, BLAG, for the most part, eschews the justifications\n5 proffered by Congress for the legislation.  However, the group does reiterate the legislative\n6 justifications of encouraging responsible procreation and child-rearing and the government’s\n7 interest in defending and nurturing the institution of traditional, heterosexual marriage. \n8   The Court does not find the justification of encouraging responsible procreation and\n9 child-rearing survives rational basis scrutiny.  Even if the Court were to accept as true, which it\n10 does not, that opposite-sex parenting is somehow superior to same-sex parenting, DOMA is not\nt 11 rationally related to this alleged governmental interest. \nr\nu\no\na 12 Under rational basis review, although the fit between the classification and the stated\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 government interest need not be perfect, the classification must be “narrow enough in scope and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 grounded in sufficient factual context ... to ascertain some relation between the classification\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 and the purpose it serve[s].”  Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33.  Rational basis review invalidates a\nS N 16 measure whose “sheer breadth” is “discontinuous with the reasons offered for it.”  Id. at 632,\nted  For the  17 635 (rejecting justifications where “[t]he breadth of the [measure] is so far removed from these\ni\nn\nU\n18 particular justifications that we find it impossible to credit them”); see also Eisenstadt v. Baird,\n19 405 U.S. 438, 449 (1972) (rejecting justification of law discriminating between married and\n20 unmarried individuals in access to contraceptives as “so riddled with exceptions” that the\n21 interest claimed by the government “cannot reasonably be regarded as its aim”).  \n22\n23\n8  During oral argument, counsel for BLAG argued that another possible justification\n24 for DOMA, somewhat related to protection of the public fisc, is “to rationally maintain\nbargains that were decided upon by previous Congresses. ...  There were bargains made, and\n25 there were calculus [sic] made in terms of ... what benefits are we going to give, what\nburdens are we going to put on people.”  (Transcript at 59.)  The decision of where and how\n26 to protect the government fisc and to protect the bargains struck by previous Congresses does\nnot independently constitute a rational basis upon which to differentiate among classes of\n27 citizens.  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1014; see also Plyler, 457 U.S. at 227, 229 (holding that\npreservation of government resources cannot, as a matter of law, justify barring some\n28 arbitrarily chosen group from a government program).  There must be some rational basis\nupon which to decide not to expend public resources for a particular group.\n35\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page36 of 43\n1 DOMA has no effect on who may become a parent under federal or state law. \n2 Moreover, whether a same-sex couple is entitled to marriage benefits has no rational relation to\n3 that couple’s or an opposite-sex couple’s ability to procreate.  Significantly, to reiterate, the\n4 ability to procreate has never been a precondition to marriage in any jurisdiction.  See\n5 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605 (Scalia, J. dissenting).9  Here, there is simply no connection between\n6 the ability (or capacity) to become a parent and the designation of federal entitlements based on\n7 a definition of marriage that excludes legally married couples who are capable of becoming\n8 parents.   \n9 Denying federal benefits to same-sex married couples has no rational effect on the\n10 procreation and child-rearing practices of opposite-sex married (or unmarried) couples.  See\nt 11 Perry II, 2012, WL 372713, at *21 (“There is no rational reason to think that taking away the\nr\nu\no\na 12 designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples would advance the goal of encouraging ...\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 opposite-sex couples to procreate more responsibly.”)  To the extent some people may have a\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 bias in favor of preferring biological parents over other couples, there is no such recognition of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 this distinction under federal or state law.  See id.  There has been no showing that DOMA\nS N 16 alters any state or federal law governing childbearing, procreation or family structure.  Given\nted  For the  17 the state of the law, the rationale of promoting responsible child-rearing finds no “‘footing in\ni\nn\nU\n18 the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation,’ and thus cannot be credited as rational.” \n19 Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *20 (citing Heller, 509 U.S. at 321).\n20 Accordingly, the Court finds that Congress’ stated justification of encouraging\n21 responsible procreation and child-rearing bears no rational relationship to the classification\n22 which burdens same-sex married couples.   \n23\n24\n9  During oral argument, counsel for BLAG argued that an additional reason for the\n25 passage of DOMA was the fact that opposite-sex married couples could “have accidental\npregnancies” or “can make babies spontaneously.”  (Transcript at 63-64.)  BLAG did not,\n26 however, articulate how the fact that opposite-sex couples can have accidental pregnancies\nconstitutes an interest supporting the passage of DOMA.  Although the generation of\n27 children may be biologically more spontaneous with opposite-sex couples, married or\nunmarried, the Court remains perplexed how the uniformly deliberate decision of same-sex\n28 married couples to become parents can be perceived as a justification against supporting their\nprocreation and child-rearing efforts.\n36\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page37 of 43\n1 b. Nurturing the institution of traditional, opposite-sex marriage.\n2 BLAG contends that the institution of opposite-sex marriage is deeply rooted in\n3 American law, embedded in history and tradition, and has been defined both by Black’s Law\n4 Dictionary and the Bible.  (BLAG Motion to Dismiss at 23-24, citing Marsh v. Chambers, 463\n5 U.S. 783, 792 (1983) (holding that traditional marriage “is deeply embedded in the history and\n6 tradition of this country” and “has become part of the fabric of our society”) and Baker v.\n7 Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 186 (Minn. 1971) (holding that the “institution of marriage as a union\n8 of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family,\n9 is as old as the book of Genesis.”)).  \n10 Again, the argument that the definition of marriage should remain the same for the\nt 11 definition’s sake is a circular argument, not a rational justification.  Simply stating what has\nr\nu\no\na 12 always been does not address the reasons for it.  The mere fact that prior law, history, tradition,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the dictionary and the Bible have defined a term does not give that definition a rational basis, it\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 merely states what has been.  Tradition, standing alone, does not provide a rational basis for the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 law.  Williams, 399 U.S. at 239.  Simply, the “ancient lineage” of the law does not render it\nS N 16 rational.  See Heller, 509 U.S. at 327.\nted  For the  17 BLAG argues, but does not explain how denying marriage benefits only to same-sex\ni\nn\nU\n18 couples will somehow make marriage between opposite-sex couples better.  The proffered\n19 justification may derive from strongly-held religious or fundamentally traditional beliefs, but\n20 still does not provide a legally recognizable rational basis for sustaining a law that actively\n21 discriminates against legally married couples.  The exclusion of same-sex couples from the\n22 federal definition of marriage does nothing to encourage or strengthen opposite-sex marriages. \n23 See Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *23 (holding that “the argument that withdrawing the\n24 designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples could on its own promote the strength or\n25 stability of opposite-sex marital relationships lacks any such footing in reality”); see also Perry,\n26 704 F. Supp. 2d at 972 (“Permitting same-sex couples to marry will not affect the number of\n27 opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage or\n28 otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages”); In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at 932 (this\n37\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page38 of 43\n1 governmental interest “is largely irrelevant to the rational basis analysis here because the same-\n2 sex couples who seek the benefits are already married.  Also, gays and lesbians will not be\n3 encouraged to enter into marriages with members of the opposite sex by the government’s\n4 denial of benefits to same-sex spouses, and the denial will not discourage same-sex couples\n5 from entering into same-sex marriages; so the denial cannot be said to ‘nurture’ or ‘defend’ the\n6 institution of heterosexual marriage.”).  \n7 Accordingly, the Court finds that Congress’ stated justification of nurturing the\n8 institution of traditional, opposite-sex marriage bears no rational relationship to the\n9 classification which burdens same-sex married couples.   \n10 3. Application of Rational Basis Review to Alternative Justifications Proffered\nby BLAG.\nt 11\nr\nu BLAG does not rely exclusively on the stated legislative justifications advanced by\no\na 12\nC ni\n  or Congress during its passage of DOMA.  A court may “hypothesize the motivations of the ...\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  legislature to find a legitimate objective promoted by the provision under attack.”  Shaw, 887\n Dis District  14 F.2d at 948-49 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “[I]t is entirely irrelevant for\ntates orthern  15 constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 motivated the legislature.”  Beach Communications, 508 U.S. at 313.  In this regard, BLAG has\ni\nn proffered several additional hypothetical rational bases for passing DOMA.  \nU\n18\na. Congressional caution in defining a legislative term and maintaining\n19 the status quo.\n20 BLAG contends that Congress could have had a rational basis for the passage of DOMA\n21 by preserving the status quo in the federal definition of marriage while waiting for the states to\n22 “tinker with the substantive centuries-old definition of marriage.”  (BLAG Opp. Br. on Motion\n23 for Summary Judgment at 22.)  To the extent this argument is premised upon preserving a\n24 traditional definition of marriage for its own sake, the Court has already rejected this argument. \n25 As the court found in Gill, “[s]taying the course is not an end in and of itself, but rather a means\n26 to an end.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 390-94.  The long history of discrimination against gay men\n27 and lesbians does not provide a rational basis for continuing it.\n28\n38\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page39 of 43\n1 Moreover, DOMA does not preserve the status quo.  The passage of DOMA marks a\n2 stark departure from tradition and a blatant disregard of the well-accepted concept of federalism\n3 in the area of domestic relations.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392 (finding that DOMA\n4 “mark[ed] the first time the federal government has ever attempted to legislatively mandate a\n5 uniform federal definition of marriage – or any other core concept of domestic relations, for that\n6 matter”); see also Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d at 1189 (“[S]ection three of DOMA was a\n7 preemptive strike to bar federal legal recognition of same-sex marriages should certain states\n8 decide to allow them, rather than a law that furthered the status quo, which gave the states\n9 authority to define marriage for themselves.”).\n10 The status quo prior to the passage of DOMA was federal recognition of the individual\nt 11 states’ authority to define marriage.  “The whole subject of the domestic relations ... belongs to\nr\nu\no\na 12 the laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States.”  Elk Grove Unified School\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004) (citation omitted); see also Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 393, 404 (1975) (holding that “domestic relations” have “long been regarded as a virtually\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 exclusive province of the States” and “[t]he State ... has absolute right” to regulate marriage)\nS N 16 (citations omitted); Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 703, 716 (1992) (“declarations of\nted  For the  17 status, e.g., marriage, annulment, divorce, custody, and paternity,” lie at the “core” of domestic\ni\nn\nU\n18 relations law reserved to the states) (Blackmun, J., concurring).  \n19 Prior to the enactment of DOMA, the federal government had not attempted to craft its\n20 own federal definition of marriage, “notwithstanding the occurrence of other similarly\n21 politically-charged, protracted, and fluid debates at the state level as to who should be permitted\n22 to marry.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392.  Congress accepted without revision the patchwork of\n23 different state marriage definitions regarding, for example, age requirements or marriage among\n24 related persons.  (See e.g., Declaration of Nancy Cott (“Cott Decl.”) at ¶¶ 26, 51-52, 56-57.) \n25 The federal government has continued to defer to the states during unprecedented, hotly-\n26 contested shifts in state marriage law, especially in the area of interracial marriage.  (Id. at ¶¶\n27\n28\n39\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page40 of 43\n1 57.)  The strong tradition of federalism mandated that the federal government refrain from\n2 inserting itself in the business of domestic relations.10 \n3 The Court finds that the passage of DOMA, rather than maintaining the status quo in the\n4 arena of domestic relations, stands in stark contrast to it.  Accordingly, the Court finds that\n5 Congressional caution in defining a legislative term and maintaining the status quo does not\n6 constitute a rational basis. \n7 b. Congressional caution in area of social divisiveness.\n8 BLAG also contends that Congress should remain cautious, especially in an area of so\n9 much social divisiveness, by holding the purported federal definition of marriage steady while\n10 waiting to see how the states tinker with new definitions.  The Court finds the contention\nt 11 similar to arguments that were advanced in support of antimiscegenation laws.  Proponents\nr\nu\no\na 12 similarly argued that the long-standing tradition of the separation of the races provided\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 justification for prohibiting interracial marriage.  The lower court in Loving found that God had\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 created the races and placed them on separate continents in order that there “would be no cause\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 for such [interracial] marriages.”  388 U.S. at 3.  It was, at the time, a strongly-held belief\nS N 16 among proponents of antimiscegenation laws that mixing the races was against God’s will,\nted  For the  17 flaunted a long history of tradition and, at its core, endangered the institution of marriage.  See\ni\nn\nU\n18 id.  However, in its holding in Loving, the Supreme Court found that although interracial\n19 marriage was a socially divisive issue and proponents of antimiscegenation held traditional and\n20\n10  BLAG contends that Congress has previously enacted laws which create unique\n21 federal definitions of marriage, for instance in the area federal tax regulations, Social\nSecurity, immigration or federal benefits.  However, in each instance, the federal government\n22 accepted the state definitions of marriage and merely superimposed further requirements for\nfalling within the federal entitlement statute.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 416 (requiring marriage\n23 of at least one year to obtain certain Social Security benefits); 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(b)(1)\n(discrediting marriages entered into merely to obtain immigration status).  These federal\n24 requirements do not purport to redefine or create a federal definition of marriage, but rather\nimpose additional criteria to further particular legislative goals.  \n25\nIn addition, BLAG cites examples in which Congress legislated in the area of\n26 domestic relations, such as when it banned polygamy in the Utah Territory, when it promoted\nand supported marriages of former slaves after the Civil War, and legislation in the context\n27 of treatment of Indians tribes.  However, in each of those unique historical instances,\nCongress was acting in the role of the state in the absence of a secure state government. \n28 (See, e.g., Cott Decl. at ¶¶ 75-79.)  DOMA marks a radical departure from the tradition of\nfederalism in the area of domestic relations.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392.\n40\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page41 of 43\n1 religious beliefs about the erosion of the traditional concept of marriage, Virginia’s racial\n2 classification violated the equal protection guarantee.  Id. at 11-12.  \n3 More recently, in Romer, the Supreme Court addressed a proposed amendment to the\n4 Colorado state constitution that would prohibit all legislative, executive, or judicial action\n5 designed to protect discrimination against homosexuals.  One of the arguments in support of the\n6 state amendment was that it was an attempt to withdraw “a deeply divisive social and political\n7 issue from elected representatives and place its resolution squarely in the hands of the people.”\n8 (See Brief for Petitioner filed April 21, 1995 in Romer v. Evans, No. 94-1039 (Supreme Court),\n9 1995 WL 17008429, at *10.)   Proponents contended that it was important to ensure that “the\n10 deeply divisive issue of homosexuality does not serve to seriously fragment Colorado’s body\nt 11 politic.”  (See id., at *47.)  Proponents argued that it required some leeway in this socially\nr\nu\no\na 12 divisive atmosphere to handle the “sensitive and core political choices” in matters regarding\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 discrimination against homosexuals calmly over time.  (Id.)  The Supreme Court, however,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 flatly rejected this argument as providing a rational basis and found that the proposed\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 amendment to the Colorado state constitution was unconstitutional.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 620.  \nS N 16 Here, too, this Court finds that Congress cannot, like an ostrich, merely bury its head in\nted  For the  17 the sand and wait for danger to pass, especially at the risk of permitting continued constitutional\ni\nn\nU\n18 injury upon legally married couples.  The fact that the issue is socially divisive does nothing to\n19 relieve the judiciary of its obligation to examine the constitutionality of the discriminating\n20 classifications in the law.\n21 Accordingly, the Court finds that Congressional caution in the area of social\n22 divisiveness does not constitute a rational basis. \n23 c. Consistency.\n24 BLAG also contends that Congress could have rationally sought to base eligibility for\n25 federal benefits on a traditional definition of marriage in order “to avoid the arbitrariness and\n26 inconsistency in such eligibility ... and not depend[] on the vagaries of state law.”  (BLAG\n27 Motion to Dismiss at 24.)  However, as explained above, in all of the years preceding the\n28 passage of DOMA, Congress relied on the various states’ definitions of marriage without\n41\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page42 of 43\n1 incident.  All couples married under state law were entitled to federal benefits, even if the\n2 particulars of the states’ definitions were variable.  The passage of DOMA actually undermined\n3 administrative consistency by requiring that the federal government, for the first time, discern\n4 which state definitions of marriage are entitled to federal recognition and which are not. \n5 Accordingly, the Court finds that consistency does not constitute a rational basis.\n6 d. Any other possible basis.\n7 The Court finds that neither Congress’ claimed legislative justifications nor any of the\n8 proposed reasons proffered by BLAG constitute bases rationally related to any of the alleged\n9 governmental interests.  Further, after concluding that neither the law nor the record can sustain\n10 any of the interests suggested, the Court, having tried on its own, cannot conceive of any\nt 11 additional interests that DOMA might further.  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1015.\nr\nu\no\na 12 CONCLUSION\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 For the foregoing reasons, the Court HEREBY DENIES BLAG’s motion to dismiss;\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 DENIES as moot BLAG’s motion to strike; GRANTS Ms. Golinski’s motion for summary\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 judgment; and GRANTS the OPM’s motion to dismiss.  \nS N 16 The Court has found that DOMA unconstitutionally discriminates against same-sex\nted  For the  17 married couples.  Even though animus is clearly present in its legislative history, the Court,\ni\nn\nU\n18 having examined that history, the arguments made in its support, and the effects of the law, is\n19 persuaded that something short of animus may have motivated DOMA’s passage:\n20 Prejudice, we are beginning to unders tand, rises not from malice or hostile\nanimus alone.  It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of\n21 careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against\npeople who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves.  \n22\nBoard of Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374-75 (2001) (Kennedy,\n23\nJ., concurring). \n24\nThis case was presented by an employee of the judicial branch against the executive\n25\nbranch, which ultimately determined it could not legitimately support the law.  The law was\n26\nthen defended by the legislative branch.  The judicial branch is tasked with determining whether\n27\nthis federal law is unconstitutional.  That is the courts’ authority and responsibility.  “It is\n28\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is” and,\n42\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document186   Filed02/22/12   Page43 of 43\n1 where it is so, to declare legislation unconstitutional.  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n2 177 (1803).  As Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts said during his confirmation\n3 hearings: “Judges are like umpires.  Umpires don’t make the rules, they apply them. ... it’s [the\n4 judge’s] job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.”  Confirmation Hearing on the\n5 Nomination of John G.

Supp. 2d 968.\nJURISDICTION\nThe judgment of the district court was entered on\nFebruary 22, 2012.  Notices of appeal were filed on Feb-\nruary 24, 2012, and February 28, 2012 (App., infra, 64a-\n(1)\n\n2\n65a, 66a-67a).  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 28 U.S.C. 2101(e).\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY\nPROVISIONS INVOLVED\nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are\nset forth in the appendix to this petition.  App., infra,\n70a.\nSTATEMENT\n1. a. Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act\n(DOMA or Act) in 1996.  Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 Stat.\n2419.  DOMA contains two principal provisions.  The\nfirst, Section 2 of the Act, provides that no State is re-\nquired to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial\nproceeding of another State that treats a relationship\nbetween two persons of the same sex as a marriage un-\nder its laws.  DOMA § 2, 110 Stat. 2419 (28 U.S.C.\n1738C).\nThe second provision, Section 3, which is at issue in\nthis case, defines “marriage” and “spouse” for all pur-\nposes under federal law to exclude marriages between\npersons of the same sex, including marriages recognized\nunder state law.  Section 3 provides:\nIn determining the meaning of any Act of Con-\ngress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation\nof the various administrative bureaus and agencies of\nthe United States, the word “marriage” means only\na legal union between one man and one woman as\nhusband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only\nto a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a\nwife.\nDOMA § 3, 110 Stat. 2419 (1 U.S.C. 7).\n\n3\nb. Congress enacted DOMA in response to the Ha-\nwaii Supreme Court’s decision in Baehr v. Lewin, 852\nP.2d 44 (1993), which held that the denial of marriage\nlicenses to same-sex couples was presumptively invalid\nunder the Hawaii Constitution.  H.R. Rep. No. 664,\n104th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1996) (1996 House Report).\nAlthough Hawaii ultimately did not permit same-sex\nmarriage, other States, including California, later recog-\nnized such marriages under their respective laws.  See\nMassachusetts v. United States Dep’t of Health & Hu-\nman Servs., Nos. 10-2204, -2207, and -2214, 2012 WL\n1948017, at *1 nn.1-2; In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d\n384 (Cal. 2008).1\nAlthough Section 3 of DOMA does not purport to\ninvalidate same-sex marriages in those States that per-\nmit them, it excludes such marriages from recognition\nfor purposes of more than 1000 federal statutes and pro-\ngrams whose administration turns in part on individuals’\nmarital status.  See U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Report\nNo. GAO-04-353R, Defense of Marriage Act: Update to\nPrior Report 1 (2004), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/\nd04353r.pdf (GAO Report) (identifying 1138 federal laws\nthat are contingent on marital status or in which marital\nstatus is a factor).  Section 3 of DOMA thus denies to\nlegally married same-sex couples many substantial ben-\n1 The California Supreme Court’s decision in In re Marriage Cases\nwas superseded by a 2008 state constitutional amendment that limited\nstate-recognized marriages to those between a man and a woman.  Cal.\nConst. Art. I, § 7.5.  That amendment did not, however, invalidate same-\nsex marriages performed before its effective date.  Strauss v. Horton,\n207 P.3d 48, 98-110, 119-122 (Cal. 2009) (interpreting the amendment to\napply prospectively only).  The Ninth Circuit later struck down the\nconstitutional amendment as invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.\nPerry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052, 1096 (2012).  The validity of that ruling\nis not at issue in this case.\n\n4\nefits otherwise available to legally married couples un-\nder federal employment, immigration, public health and\nwelfare, tax, and other laws.  See id. at 16-18.\n2. Respondent Golinski is a staff attorney employed\nby the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit.  App., infra, 2a.  In 2008, she married her same-\nsex partner of more than 20 years, with whom she has a\nyoung son, in California.  Ibid.; Second Am. Compl.\n¶¶ 15, 17, 19.  After they married, Golinski sought to\nenroll her spouse as a beneficiary under her federal em-\nployee “self and family” health insurance plan.  Second\nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19, 22.  The Administrative Office of\nthe United States Courts refused her request on the\nground that Section 3 of DOMA forbids extending Fed-\neral Employee Health Benefits Plan coverage to same-\nsex spouses.  Id. ¶¶ 23-24; see 5 U.S.C. 8901(5); see also\n1 U.S.C. 7.\nGolinski filed a complaint under the Ninth Circuit’s\nEmployment Dispute Resolution Plan, contending that\nthe denial of health benefits violated the Plan’s provi-\nsions forbidding discrimination on the basis of sex or\nsexual orientation.  App., infra, 2a-3a.  In a series of\norders, Chief Judge Kozinski, sitting in his administra-\ntive capacity, ruled in Golinski’s favor and ordered the\ngovernment to make health benefits available to Golin-\nski’s spouse on the same terms that an opposite-sex\nspouse would have enjoyed.  In re Golinski, 587 F.3d\n956 (9th Cir. 2009) (Kozinski, C.J.); In re Golinski, 587\nF.3d 901 (9th Cir. 2009) (Kozinski, C.J.); see App., infra,\n3a-6a.\nGolinski thereafter filed a mandamus action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District\nof California to compel compliance with Chief Judge\nKozinski’s orders.  The district court granted the govern-\n\n5\nment’s motion to dismiss on the basis that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to issue mandamus relief, but granted leave to\namend.  781 F. Supp. 2d 967 (N.D. Cal. 2011); see App.,\ninfra, 5a-6a.  Golinski then filed an amended complaint\nin which she, inter alia, challenged the constitutionality\nof Section 3, as applied to deny health coverage for her\nspouse, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\nApp., infra, 7a; Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 72, 74-81.    \n3. While Golinski’s mandamus action was pending,\nthe Attorney General sent a notification to Congress\nunder 28 U.S.C. 530D that he and the President had\ndetermined that Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional\nas applied to same-sex couples who are legally married\nunder state law.  Letter from Eric H. Holder Jr., Att’y\nGen., to John A. Boehner, Speaker, U.S. House of Rep-\nresentatives (Feb. 23, 2011) (Attorney General Letter).2\nThe letter explained that, while the Department of Jus-\ntice had previously defended Section 3 in courts whose\nbinding precedent required application of rational basis\nreview to classifications based on sexual orientation, the\nPresident and the Department of Justice had conducted\na new examination of the issue after two lawsuits had\nbeen filed in a circuit that had yet to address the appro-\npriate standard of review.  Id. at 1-2.  The Attorney Gen-\neral explained that, after examining several factors this\nCourt has identified as relevant to the applicable level of\nscrutiny, including the history of discrimination against\ngay and lesbian individuals and the relevance of sexual\norientation to legitimate policy objectives, he and the\nPresident had concluded that Section 3 warrants appli-\ncation of heightened scrutiny rather than rational basis\n2 Text  available  at  http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/\n11-ag-223.html.  \n\n6\nreview.  Id. at 2-4.  The Attorney General further ex-\nplained that both he and the President had concluded\nthat Section 3 fails that standard of review and is there-\nfore unconstitutional.  Id. at 4-5.\nThe Attorney General’s letter reported that, notwith-\nstanding  this  determination,  the  President  had  “in-\nstructed Executive agencies to continue to comply with\nSection 3 of DOMA, consistent with the Executive’s obli-\ngation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\nunless and until Congress repeals Section 3 or the judi-\ncial branch renders a definitive verdict against the law’s\nconstitutionality.”  Attorney General Letter 5.  The At-\ntorney General explained that “[t]his course of action\nrespects the actions of the prior Congress that enacted\nDOMA, and it recognizes the judiciary as the final arbi-\nter of the constitutional claims raised.”  Ibid.  In the\ninterim, the Attorney General instructed the Depart-\nment’s lawyers to cease defense of Section 3.  Id. at 5-6.\nFinally, the Attorney General noted that the Depart-\nment’s  lawyers  would  take  appropriate  steps  to\n“provid[e] Congress a full and fair opportunity to partici-\npate” in litigation concerning the constitutionality of\nSection 3.  Id. at 6.\nFollowing  the  Attorney  General’s  announcement,\nrespondent  Bipartisan  Legal  Advisory  Group  of  the\nUnited States House of Representatives (BLAG), a five-\nmember bipartisan leadership group, moved to inter-\nvene to present a defense of the constitutionality of Sec-\ntion 3.3  The district court granted the motion.  6/3/11\nOrder 1; see App., infra, 7a.\n3 Two of the group’s five members declined to support intervention.\nBLAG Mot. to Intervene 1 n.1 (May 4, 2011).\n\n7\nBoth BLAG and the government moved to dismiss\nGolinski’s amended complaint challenging the constitu-\ntionality of Section 3.  While BLAG presented argu-\nments in support of Section 3’s constitutionality, the\ngovernment explained that it was filing a motion to dis-\nmiss Golinski’s constitutional claim solely for purposes\nof ensuring that the court had Article III jurisdiction to\nenter judgment for or against the federal officials tasked\nwith enforcing Section 3.  The government’s brief on the\nmerits set forth its view that heightened scrutiny applies\nto Section 3 of DOMA and that, under that standard of\nreview, Section 3 violates the equal protection guarantee\nof the Fifth Amendment.  Gov’t Br. in Opp. to Mots. to\nDismiss 2-23 (July 1, 2011).\n4. The district court denied BLAG’s motion to dis-\nmiss and granted summary judgment in favor of Golin-\nski, concluding that Section 3 of DOMA violates the\nequal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.\nApp., infra, 1a-61a.\nThe district court acknowledged that the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had previously held that laws that classify on the\nbasis of sexual orientation are subject to deferential re-\nview under a rational basis standard.  See App., infra,\n20a-21a (citing High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec.\nClearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir. 1990)).  The\ndistrict court concluded, however, that High Tech Gays\nwas no longer binding in light of intervening Supreme\nCourt precedent.  Id. at 21a-24a.  The court explained\nthat High Tech Gays had relied on this Court’s now-\noverruled decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186\n(1986), overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558\n(2003), upholding a state criminal prohibition on sodomy,\nas well as on a distinction between sexual orientation\nand same-sex behavior that this Court has since re-\n\n8\njected, see Christian Legal Soc’y Chapter of the Univ.\nof Cal. v. Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 2990 (2010).  After\nexamining several factors bearing on the applicability of\nheightened scrutiny, including the history of discrimina-\ntion against gay and lesbian individuals and the irrele-\nvance of sexual orientation to an individual’s ability to\ncontribute to society, the district court concluded that\nheightened scrutiny applies to sexual orientation classi-\nfications.  App., infra, 25a-34a.\nThe district court held that Section 3 fails under\nheightened scrutiny.  App., infra, 34a-53a.  The court\nconcluded that none of the actual rationales underlying\nSection 3’s enactment, as set out in the House Commit-\ntee Report accompanying DOMA, provides a justifica-\ntion for the law substantially related to an important\ngovernmental  objective.    Id.  at  36a-44a  (citing  1996\nHouse Report 12-18).  The court explained that denying\nbenefits to same-sex couples who are already married\nunder state law does not substantially further any gov-\nernmental  interest  in  “responsible  procreation  and\nchild-rearing” or in “nurturing the institution of tradi-\ntional, heterosexual marriage.”  Id. at 36a; see id. at 36a-\n42a.  The court further explained that neither an inter-\nest in “defending traditional notions of morality” nor an\ninterest in “preserving scarce government resources”\njustifies Section 3’s differential treatment of same-sex\nmarried couples.  Id. at 36a; see id. at 42a-44a.\nIn the alternative, the district court held that Section\n3 fails rational basis review.  App., infra, 44a-59a.  The\ncourt concluded that none of the stated rationales for\nSection 3’s enactment bears a rational relationship to a\nlegitimate governmental objective.  Id. at 47a-53a.  The\ncourt also rejected several additional rationales offered\nby BLAG, including “preserving the status quo in the\n\n9\nfederal  definition  of  marriage  while  waiting  for  the\nstates to ‘tinker with the substantive centuries-old defi-\nnition of marriage,’” id. at 54a (citation omitted), “Con-\ngressional caution in [an] area of social divisiveness,” id.\nat 56a, and maintaining consistency in the provision of\nfederal benefits, id. at 58a.  The court reasoned that,\nbecause pre-DOMA federal law generally recognized\nmarriages that were valid under state law, Section 3\nneither preserves the status quo nor promotes consis-\ntency in the administration of federal programs.  Id. at\n54a-56a, 58a-59a.  And in the court’s view, “[t]he fact\nthat the issue is socially divisive” is not a rational basis\nfor “the discriminating classifications in the law.”  Id. at\n56a-58a.\n5. Both  BLAG  and  the  government  filed  timely\nnotices of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit.  App., infra, 64a-65a (government\nnotice of appeal); id. at 66a-67a (BLAG notice of appeal).\nThe  court  of  appeals  has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to\n28  U.S.C.  1291.    The  appeals  were  docketed  as\nNo. 12-15388 and No. 12-15409.\nThe government petitioned the court of appeals for\ninitial hearing en banc.  The court denied the petition.\nPet. App. 68a-69a.  The case remains pending before a\npanel of that court.  See ibid.  The case is therefore “in\nthe court[] of appeals” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n1254.  See Eugene Gressman et al., Supreme Court\nPractice § 2.4, at 83-84 (9th ed. 2007).\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION\nSection 3 of DOMA denies to same-sex couples le-\ngally married under state law significant federal bene-\nfits that are otherwise available to persons lawfully mar-\nried under state law.  Because such differential treat-\n\n10\nment bears no substantial relationship to any important\ngovernmental objective, Section 3 violates the guarantee\nof equal protection secured by the Fifth Amendment.\nAlthough the Executive Branch agrees with the dis-\ntrict court’s determination in this case that Section 3 is\nunconstitutional, we respectfully seek this Court’s re-\nview so that the question may be authoritatively decided\nby this Court.  As explained above, to ensure that the\nJudiciary is the final arbiter of Section 3’s constitution-\nality, the President has instructed Executive depart-\nments and agencies to continue to enforce Section 3 until\nthere is a definitive judicial ruling that Section 3 is un-\nconstitutional.  Attorney General Letter 5; see p. 7, su-\npra.  As the federal entities charged with Section 3’s\nenforcement, and against whom judgment was entered\nbelow, petitioners are the proper parties to invoke this\nCourt’s power to review the court of appeals’ judgment.\nSee INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 930-931 (1983) (“When\nan agency of the United States is a party to a case in\nwhich the Act of Congress it administers is held uncon-\nstitutional,” it may appeal that decision, even though\n“the Executive may agree with the holding that the stat-\nute in question is unconstitutional.”); United States v.\nLovett, 328 U.S. 303, 306-307 (1946) (reviewing constitu-\ntionality of a congressional enactment on the petition of\nthe Solicitor General, even though the Solicitor General\nagreed with the lower court’s holding that the statute\nwas unconstitutional); see United States v. Lovett, 327\nU.S. 773 (1946) (granting Solicitor General’s petition for\na writ of certiorari).4\n4 The fact that the government agrees with respondent Golinski  that\nSection 3 is unconstitutional does not prevent this Court from resolving\nthat issue.  Cf., e.g., National Fed’n of Indep. Businesses v. Sebelius,\nNo. 11-393 (June 28, 2012), slip op. 11.  Consistent with 28 U.S.C. 530D\n\n11\nThe government is today filing a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari seeking review of the decision of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Massa-\nchusetts v. United States Department of Health & Hu-\nman Services, Nos. 10-2204, -2207, and -2214, 2012 WL\n1948017 (May 31, 2012), which invalidated Section 3 as\nviolative of the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection\nguarantee.  Certiorari before judgment is warranted\nunder the exceptional circumstances of this case to en-\nsure that this Court has an adequate vehicle to resolve\nthe question of Section 3’s constitutionality in a timely\nand definitive manner.  Authoritative resolution of the\nquestion presented is of great importance to the United\nStates and to respondent Golinski and tens of thousands\nand prior practice in cases in which the Department has declined to\ndefend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress, the Attorney Gen-\neral notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Presi-\ndent of the Senate, and other congressional leaders of the Department’s\nposition in this case.  The Department did not oppose the subsequent\nintervention by BLAG for the purpose of presenting arguments in\nsupport of the constitutionality of Section 3.  Although the interest of\nMembers of Congress in the constitutionality of a federal statute does\nnot confer standing on them to invoke this Court’s power to review a\njudgment entered against the Executive Branch petitioners to prevent\nthem from implementing the statute, see, e.g., Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S.\n811 (1997); Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986); Valley Forge\nChristian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State,\n454 U.S. 464, 482-483 (1982); Newdow v. United States Congress, 313\nF.3d 495, 499-500 (9th Cir. 2002), with the case now before this Court\non this petition filed by the Executive Branch petitioners, it is appropri-\nate for BLAG to present arguments in defense of the validity of the\nmeasure.  See, e.g., Lovett, 328 U.S. at 306-307 (after this Court granted\nthe petition for a writ of certiorari filed by the Solicitor General on\nbehalf of the United States, counsel for Congress appeared to present\nargument in support of the constitutionality of the challenged legisla-\ntion).\n\n12\nof others who are being denied the equal enjoyment of\nthe benefits that federal law makes available to persons\nwho are legally married under state law.\nA. Review Of The Constitutionality Of DOMA Section 3 Is\nWarranted\nReview is warranted in this case because the court\nbelow invalidated an Act of Congress as unconstitu-\ntional.  As the government explained in its petition for a\nwrit of certiorari in Massachusetts, the question of Sec-\ntion 3’s constitutionality raises important questions of\nfederal law that have not been, but should be, settled by\nthis Court.  Massachusetts Pet. 14-22.  \nAs the petition in Massachusetts further explains,\nalthough every court of appeals to address the issue has\nconcluded that classifications based on sexual orienta-\ntion are subject to rational basis review, none has of-\nfered an explanation for that conclusion that withstands\nscrutiny under this Court’s precedents.  Massachusetts\nPet. 18-21.  In the decision below, the district court con-\ncluded that Ninth Circuit precedent applying rational\nbasis review to sexual orientation classifications is irrec-\noncilable with intervening Supreme Court precedent.\nSee App., infra, 21a-23a (criticizing High Tech Gays v.\nDefense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563 (9th\nCir. 1990)).  The court further concluded that each factor\nbearing on the applicability of heightened scrutiny, in-\ncluding whether the challenged legislation targets a\nclass of individuals who have historically suffered dis-\ncrimination on the basis of a characteristic not ordinarily\nrelevant to state decisionmaking, counsels in favor of\napplying heightened scrutiny to classifications based on\nsexual orientation.  Id. at 25a-34a.\n\n13\nThe district court concluded that Section 3 cannot\nsurvive under heightened scrutiny because the denial of\nfederal benefits to same-sex couples who are legally\nmarried under their States’ laws bears no substantial\nrelationship to any important governmental purpose\nthat motivated Section 3’s enactment.  App., infra, 36a-\n44a.  Alternatively, the district court concluded that Sec-\ntion 3 would fail even rational basis review because Sec-\ntion 3 is not rationally related to any conceivable legiti-\nmate interest of the federal government.  Id. at 44a-59a.\nThis case squarely raises important questions about\nthe Constitution’s equal protection guarantee as it ap-\nplies to a federal statute that draws distinctions among\npersons who are legally married under their States’ laws\non the basis of their sexual orientation.  For the reasons\ngiven in the government’s Massachusetts petition, those\nquestions, and the ultimate question of the constitution-\nality of Section 3 of DOMA, warrant authoritative reso-\nlution by this Court.\nB. The Exceptional Public Importance Of The Question\nPresented Warrants Granting Certiorari Before Judg-\nment\nIn this case, unlike Massachusetts, the court of ap-\npeals has not yet reviewed the judgment.  But also un-\nlike Massachusetts, the lower court in this case engaged\nin de novo consideration of the applicable level of scru-\ntiny, having concluded that it was not bound by circuit\nprecedent applying rational basis review to sexual orien-\ntation classifications.  The district court’s analysis may\nmaterially assist this Court’s consideration of that ques-\ntion.  Because the issues raised by the decision below\nare of exceptional public importance and call for defini-\ntive and timely resolution by this Court, the petition for\n\n14\na writ of certiorari before judgment in this case should\nbe granted.\n1. Under this Court’s rules, a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari before judgment in a case pending in a court\nof appeals will be granted “only upon a showing that the\ncase is of such imperative public importance as to justify\nthe deviation from normal appellate practice and to re-\nquire immediate determination in this Court.”  Sup. Ct.\nR. 11.\nThis Court has previously granted certiorari before\njudgment when necessary to obtain expeditious resolu-\ntion of exceptionally important legal questions. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Fanfan, 543 U.S. 220, 229 (2005) (con-\nstitutionality of mandatory applications of the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines); Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\nU.S. 244, 259-260 (2003) (constitutionality of race-con-\nscious undergraduate admissions program); Mistretta v.\nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 362, 371 (1989) (constitu-\ntionality of the federal Sentencing Guidelines); Dames\n& Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 667-668 (1981) (validity\nof Iran hostage agreement); United States v. Nixon, 418\nU.S. 683, 686-687 (1974) (validity of subpoena to the\nPresident); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U.S. 579, 584 (1952) (validity of President’s steel\nseizure order); Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1942)\n(validity of President’s assignment to a military tribunal\nof jurisdiction over the trial of belligerent saboteurs). \nSee generally James Lindgren & William R. Marshall,\nThe Supreme Court’s Extraordinary Power to Grant\nCertiorari Before Judgment in the Court of Appeals,\n1986 Sup. Ct. Rev. 259.\nAmong these cases are several in which the Court\nhas granted certiorari before judgment because it had\nalso granted review in another case presenting the same\n\n15\nor similar issue.  See, e.g., Fanfan, 543 U.S. at 229 (de-\ncided with United States v. Booker); Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n259 (presenting issue similar to another case granted in\nthe ordinary course); New Haven Inclusion Cases, 399\nU.S. 392, 418 (1970) (petition for certiorari before judg-\nment granted to permit consideration of issues in tan-\ndem with closely related case in which Court had noted\nprobable jurisdiction); United States v. Bankers’ Trust\nCo., 294 U.S. 240, 243 (1935) (Court granted United\nStates’ petition for certiorari before judgment where\nanother case presenting same issue was already pending\nbefore the Court).\n2. The government is today filing a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari to the First Circuit in Massachusetts,\nsupra.  A grant of certiorari before judgment in this\ncase is warranted to ensure that the Court will have an\nappropriate vehicle in which to resolve the issues pre-\nsented in a timely and definitive fashion.\nAssurance that the Court will have a vehicle in which\nto reach and resolve the important issues presented is\nwarranted in light of the great public importance of the\nissues at stake.  Section 3 applies to more than 1000 fed-\neral statutes and programs whose administration de-\npends in part on marital status.  See GAO Report 1.  The\nissues decided below therefore have an important im-\npact on the conduct of a wide array of Executive func-\ntions.  Consistent with the President’s instruction to\ncontinue enforcement of Section 3 pending final judicial\nresolution of its constitutionality, so as to ensure that\nthe Judiciary is the final arbiter of the constitutional\nquestion, Executive departments and agencies will con-\ntinue to deny federal benefits to scores of affected indi-\nviduals until this Court reaches a definitive resolution of\nthe question presented.  Other cases challenging the\n\n16\nconstitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA are currently\npending in courts across the country.  A timely and de-\nfinitive ruling on the constitutionality of Section 3 of\nDOMA is accordingly of exceptional practical impor-\ntance to the United States and to the tens of thousands\nof individuals affected by Section 3. \nRespectfully submitted.\nDONALD B.

Defendants the United States Office\nof Personnel Management (“the OPM”) and John Berry,\nits director, also filed a motion to dismiss and a response\nto BLAG’s motion to dismiss.  These motions compel the\nCourt to determine whether the Defense of Marriage\nAct (“DOMA”), 1 U.S.C. Section 7, as applied to Ms.\n(1a)\n\n2a\nGolinski, violates the United States Constitution by re-\nfusing to recognize lawful marriages in the application\nof laws governing benefits for federal employees.  Hav-\ning considered the parties’ papers, relevant legal author-\nity, and the record in this case, the Court HEREBY DE-\nNIES BLAG’s motion to dismiss; DENIES as moot\nBLAG’s motion to strike; GRANTS Ms. Golinski’s mo-\ntion for summary judgment; and GRANTS the OPM’s\nmotion to dismiss. \nBACKGROUND \n  The pertinent facts are not in dispute.  Ms. Golinski\nis a staff attorney in the Motions Unit of the Office of\nStaff Attorneys in the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit.  (Second Amended Complaint\n(“SAC”) at ¶ 18.)  Ms. Golinski has been partners with\nAmy Cunninghis (“Ms. Cunninghis”) for over twenty\nyears. They registered as domestic partners with the\nCity and County of San Francisco in 1995, and with the\nState of California in 2003.  (Id. at ¶¶ 15-17.)  On August\n21, 2008, they were legally married under the laws of the\nState of California.  (Id. at ¶ 17.)\n  Shortly after they married, Ms. Golinski sought to\nenroll Ms. Cunninghis in her existing family coverage\nhealth insurance plan, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ser-\nvice Benefit Plan, which she purchases through her em-\nployer and which already covers the couple’s adopted\nminor child.  (Id. at ¶¶ 19, 22.)  The Administrative Of-\nfice of the United States Courts (“AO”) refused to pro-\ncess her request on the basis that Ms. Golinski and her\nspouse are both women.  (Id. at ¶ 23.)  Finding that she\ncould not secure comparable health insurance coverage,\non October 2, 2008, Ms. Golinski filed a complaint under\nthe Ninth Circuit’s Employment Dispute Resolution\n\n3a\n(“EDR”) Plan, and contended that the refusal to grant\nher health benefits was a violation of the Plan’s nondis-\ncrimination provision.  (Id. at ¶ 48.)  The EDR Plan spe-\ncifically prohibits employment discrimination based on,\namong other things, sex or sexual orientation.  (Id. at\n¶ 47.) \nBy orders dated November 24, 2008 and January 13,\n2009, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, sitting in his adminis-\ntrative capacity as arbiter of the Judicial Council, found\nthat Ms. Golinski had suffered discrimination under the\nCourt’s EDR Plan and ordered the AO to process her\nhealth benefit election forms.  (Id., Exs. A, B.)  Chief\nJudge Kozinski found that the denial of health benefits\nwas based solely on the grounds of sex and sexual orien-\ntation,  in  direct  violation  of  the  EDR  Plan’s  non-\ndiscrimination provision covering Ninth Circuit employ-\nees.  (Id., Ex. B at 1-2.)  Chief Judge Kozinski found\nthat, regardless of the language in DOMA, the OPM had\nthe discretion to extend health benefits to Ms. Golinski’s\nsame-sex spouse by interpreting the terms “family mem-\nbers” and “member of the family” to set a floor, not a\nceiling, to coverage eligibility.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Chief Judge\nKozinski ordered the AO “to submit Karen Golinski’s\nHealth Benefits Election form 2089  .  .  .  to the appro-\npriate  insurance  carrier.    Any  future  health  benefit\nforms are also to be processed without regard to the sex\nof the listed spouse.”  (Id., Ex. B at 7.) \nThe AO complied, but the OPM instructed Ms. Go-\nlinski’s insurance carrier not to comply with the Ninth\nCircuit Judicial Council’s remedial order.  The OPM\ndirected the AO and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ser-\nvice Benefit Plan not to process Ms. Golinski’s request\non the basis that federal law, specifically Section 3 of\n\n4a\nDOMA, defines spouse as a member of the opposite sex\nand,  accordingly,  proscribes  the  enrollment  of  Ms.\nGolinski’s same-sex spouse in her health benefits pro-\ngram. \nIn response, on November 19, 2009, Chief Judge\nKozinski issued another order addressing the OPM’s\nconduct.  The Chief Judge, again sitting as an adminis-\ntrator, held that he had the authority, under both the\nNinth Circuit’s EDR Plan and the separation of powers\ndoctrine, to interpret the laws applicable to judicial em-\nployees in a manner that would displace “any contrary\ninterpretation by an agency or an officer of the Execu-\ntive.”  (Id., Ex. C at 14-15.)  Chief Judge Kozinski held\nthat allowing the OPM to interfere with his orders would\nbe tantamount to permitting it to exercise “dominance\nover logistics to destroy [the Judiciary’s] autonomy.”\n(Id. at 11.)  The Chief Judge further held that “[o]r-\ndering enrollment is proper and within my jurisdiction\nbecause Congress intended [the EDR] tribunal to be the\nsole forum for adjudicating complaints of workplace dis-\ncrimination by employees of the Judiciary.  With that\nresponsibility must come power equal to the task.”  (Id.\nat 9.) \nChief Judge Kozinski granted Ms. Golinski both back\npay and prospective relief.  The injunctive relief re-\nquired that the OPM “rescind its guidance or directive\nto the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit plan\nand any other plan that Ms. Golinski’s wife is not eligible\nto be enrolled as her spouse under the terms of the Fed-\neral Employees Health Benefits Program because of her\nsex or sexual orientation, or that the plans would violate\ntheir contracts with the OPM by enrolling Ms. Golinski’s\nwife as a beneficiary” and “[c]ease at once its interfer-\n\n5a\nence with the jurisdiction of this tribunal.  Specifically,\nOPM shall not advise Ms. Golinski’s health plan, the\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan, that\nproviding  coverage  for  Ms.  Golinski’s  wife  violates\nDOMA or any other federal law.  Nor shall OPM inter-\nfere in any way with the delivery of health benefits to\nMs. Golinski’s wife on the basis of her sex or sexual ori-\nentation.”  (Id. at 15-16 (emphasis in original).)  \nThe Chief Judge, in his order dated November 19,\n2009, also invited the OPM to “appeal so much of this\norder as concerns it using the procedures outlines in the\n[EDR] plan.”  (Id. at 16.)  In response, the OPM did not\nappeal the order, but instead issued a press release indi-\ncating that it was under no obligation to comply with the\nadministrative order and, although in favor of its repeal,\nindicated that the Executive agency was tasked with\nenforcing DOMA, which prohibits same-sex spouses of\nfederal employees from enrolling in the federal health\nbenefits program.  (Id., Ex. F.) \nIn his final administrative order, dated December 22,\n2009, Chief Judge Kozinski stated that the time for ap-\npeal had expired, thus rendering his prior orders in the\nmatter  “final  and  preclusive  on  all  issues  decided\ntherein.”    (Id.,  Ex.  D.)    He  further  authorized  Ms.\nGolinski to pursue any action she deemed fit against the\nOPM, including filing a mandamus action in the district\ncourt.  (Id.) \nOn January 20, 2010, Ms. Golinski filed a mandamus\naction before this Court, seeking to have the OPM re-\nscind its guidance to Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service\nBenefit Plan to deny Ms. Golinski’s wife benefits as pre-\ncluded  by  DOMA  and  to  comply  with  Chief  Judge\nKozinski’s prior orders in her administrative claim. \n\n6a\nOn January 26, 2010, Ms. Golinski moved for a pre-\nliminary injunction seeking compliance with Chief Judge\nKozinski’s order dated November 19, 2009, requiring\nthat the OPM:  (1) “rescind its guidance or directive to\nthe Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan,”\nand (2) “cease at once its interference with the jurisdic-\ntion of this tribunal” and “not advise Ms. Golinski’s\nhealth plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service\nBenefit plan, that providing coverage for Ms. Golinski’s\nwife violates DOMA or any other federal law.”  (Id. at\nEx. C, 15-16.) \nOn May 10, 2010, the OPM moved to dismiss the\nFirst Amended Complaint on the basis that this Court\nlacked  jurisdiction  to  grant  mandamus  relief  under\nthese peculiar procedural circumstances. \nWhile those motions were pending and after the par-\nties submitted supplemental briefing on the issue of the\nconstitutionality of DOMA, on February 23, 2011, at the\ndirection of President Obama, Attorney General Eric\nHolder announced that the Justice Department would\ncease its legal defense of Section 3 of DOMA.  Although\nit determined that the statute was unconstitutional and\nresolved not to continue to defend DOMA in pending\ncourt cases, the Justice Department indicated that it did\nintend to continue to enforce the law unless it was either\nrepealed by Congress or the courts rendered a final\njudgment striking it down.  (See Plaintiff’s Notice of\nSupplemental Authority (“NSA”) dated February 23,\n2011, Ex. 2.) \nOn March 16, 2011, the Court granted the motion to\ndismiss on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to issue\nmandamus relief.  Finding that amendment would not\n\n7a\nnecessarily be futile, the Court dismissed the matter\nwith leave to amend.  \nOn April 14, 2011, Ms. Golinski filed her Second\nAmended Complaint in which she directly challenges the\ndiscrimination against her as a lesbian married to some-\none of the same sex.  (SAC at ¶ 1.)  In her amended com-\nplaint, Ms. Golinski alleges an action for declaratory and\ninjunctive  relief  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  Sections\n2201-2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 and\nfor review of an agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Sec-\ntions 701-706.  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  By her amended complaint,\nMs. Golinski seeks a determination that Section 3 of\nDOMA, 1 U.S.C. Section 7, as applied to her, violates the\nUnited States Constitution by refusing to recognize law-\nful marriages for the purposes of application of the laws\ngoverning benefits for federal employees.  (Id.)  Ms.\nGolinski alleges that as a result of the violation of the\nConstitution, she has been denied, and will continue to\nbe denied, legal protections and benefits under federal\nlaw that would be available to her if she were a hetero-\nsexual with a opposite-sex spouse.  (Id.) \nThe majority of a five-member committee in Con-\ngress  voted  to  defend  DOMA  and,  on  May  4,  2011,\nBLAG sought to intervene in this matter.  On June 3,\n2011, this Court issued an order granting BLAG’s unop-\nposed motion to intervene as a party-defendant for the\nlimited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Sec-\ntion 3 of DOMA. \nOn June 3, 2011, BLAG moved to dismiss the Second\nAmended Complaint on the basis that Ms. Golinski fails\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted be-\ncause, as a matter of law, Section 3 of DOMA does not\nviolate her rights under the equal protection component\n\n8a\nof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On\nthe same date, the OPM moved to dismiss Ms. Golinski’s\nclaim as set forth in the Second Amended Complaint\nonly insofar as any claims could reasonably be construed\nto assert a statutory claim as to the language of the Fed-\neral Health Benefits Act of 1959.  On July 1, 2011, Ms.\nGolinski moved for summary judgment.  On July 15,\n2011, BLAG moved to strike extrinsic materials from\nthe record on Ms. Golinski’s opposition to the motion to\ndismiss.  The Court heard oral argument on the motions\non December 16, 2011.1\nThe Court shall address additional facts as necessary\nin the remainder of this order. \nANALYSIS \nA. Legal Standards. \n1. Motion to Dismiss. \nA motion to dismiss is proper under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) where the pleadings fail to state\na claim upon which relief can be granted.  The Court’s\n“inquiry is limited to the allegations in the complaint,\nwhich are accepted as true and construed in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.”  Lazy Y Ranch Ltd. v.\nBehrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008).  Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 8(a) requires only “a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is enti-\ntled to relief.”  Even under Rule 8(a)’s liberal pleading\nstandard,  “a  plaintiff’s  obligation  to  provide  the\n1 Initially, BLAG moved to strike several declarations submitted by\nMs. Golinski in response to the motion to dismiss.  However, as the\nCourt decides the motion for summary judgment and has therefore con-\nsidered the full record, BLAG agreed to withdraw its motion to strike.\nThe motion to strike is therefore DENIED as moot.\n\n9a\n‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more\nthan labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of\nthe elements of a cause of action will not do.  Bell Atlan-\ntic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)\n(citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)).\nPursuant to Twombly, a plaintiff must not merely\nallege conduct that is conceivable but must instead al-\nlege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plau-\nsible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  “A claim has facial plausi-\nbility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that al-\nlows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  “The plausibility standard\nis not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for\nmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\nunlawfully.  .  .  .  When a complaint pleads facts that are\nmerely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops\nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of\nentitlement to relief.”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 556-57) (internal quotation marks omitted).  If the\nallegations  are  insufficient  to  state  a  claim,  a  court\nshould grant leave to amend, unless amendment would\nbe futile.  See, e.g., Reddy v. Litton Industries, Inc., 912\nF.2d 291, 296 (9th Cir. 1990); Cook, Perkiss and Liehe,\nInc. v. Northern California Collection Service, Inc., 911\nF.2d 242, 246-47 (9th Cir. 1990). \nAs a general rule, “a district court may not consider\nany material beyond the pleadings in ruling on a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion.”  Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 453\n(9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other grounds, Galbraith v.\nCounty of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(citation omitted).  The Court may consider the facts\n\n10a\nalleged in the complaint, documents attached to the com-\nplaint, documents relied upon but not attached to the\ncomplaint, when the authenticity of those documents is\nnot questioned, and other matters of which the Court\ncan take judicial notice.  Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digi-\nmarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 990 (9th Cir. 2009).  Docu-\nments whose contents are alleged in a complaint and\nwhose authenticity no party questions, but which are not\nphysically attached to the pleading, may be considered\nin ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  Such con-\nsideration does not convert the motion to dismiss into a\nmotion for summary judgment.  See United States v.\nRitchie, 343 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003); Branch, 14\nF.3d at 454. \n2. Motion for Summary Judgment. \nA motion for summary judgment is guided by a dif-\nferent standard.  Summary judgment is appropriate\nwhen the record demonstrates “that there is no genuine\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c).  An issue is “genuine” if there is sufficient evi-\ndence  for  a  reasonable  fact  finder  to  find  for  the\nnon-moving party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 248-49 (1986).  “[A]t the summary judgment\nstage the judge’s function is not  .  .  .  to weigh the evi-\ndence and determine the truth of the matter but to de-\ntermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id.\nat 249.  A fact is “material” if it may affect the outcome\nof the case.  Id. at 248.  The party moving for summary\njudgment bears the initial responsibility of identifying\nthose portions of the record which demonstrate the ab-\nsence of a genuine issue of a material fact.  Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  In the absence of\n\n11a\nsuch facts, “the moving party is entitled to a judgment\nas a matter of law.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \nOnce the moving party meets this initial burden, the\nnon-moving party “may not rest upon the mere allega-\ntions or denials of the adverse party’s pleading, but the\nadverse party’s response, by affidavits or as otherwise\nprovided in this rule, must set forth specific facts show-\ning that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(e).  If the non-moving party fails to make this\nshowing, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \nB. Defense of Marriage Act.\nThis action presents a challenge to the constitutional-\nity of Section 3 of DOMA as applied to Ms. Golinski, a\nlesbian woman married under California law, who is un-\nable to secure federal health benefits for her same-sex\nspouse.  Specifically, Ms. Golinski alleges that, by opera-\ntion of Section 3 of DOMA, she has been denied certain\nmarriage-based federal benefits that are available to\nsimilarly-situated opposite-sex couples, in violation of\nher rights to equal protection and due process as se-\ncured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\nment. \nIn 1996, Congress enacted and President Clinton\nsigned DOMA into law. Section 3 of DOMA, the only\nprovision at issue in this matter, defines the terms “mar-\nriage” and “spouse” for purposes of federal law.  Section\n3 provides: \nIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nor of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the\nvarious administrative bureaus and agencies of the\nUnited States, the word “marriage” means only a\n\n12a\nlegal union between one man and one woman as hus-\nband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only to\na person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a\nwife. \n1 U.S.C. § 7. \nIn large part, the enactment of DOMA can be under-\nstood as a direct legislative response to Baehr v. Lewin,\na 1993 decision issued by the Hawaii Supreme Court,\nwhich indicated that same-sex couples may be entitled\nto marry under that state’s constitution.  74 Haw. 530\n(1993).  The decision raised the possibility that, for the\nfirst time, same-sex couples could begin the process of\nobtaining state-sanctioned marriage licenses.  \nIn debating the provisions of DOMA, the House ref-\nerenced the Baehr decision as the beginning of an “or-\nchestrated assault being waged against traditional het-\nerosexual marriage” and expressed concern that the\ndevelopment  “threaten[ed]  to  have  very  real  conse-\nquences  .  .  .  on federal law.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-664 at\n2-3 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2905, 2906-07\n(“H. Rep.” or “House Report”).  More specifically, the\nHouse Report warned that “a redefinition of marriage in\nHawaii to include homosexual couples could make such\ncouples eligible for a whole range of federal rights and\nbenefits.”  Id. at 10.  Although a later amendment to the\nHawaii constitution withheld permitting same-sex mar-\nriage in the state, Congress, explicitly in reaction to the\nimpending Hawaii decision, sought a means both (1) to\n“reserve[] each State’s ability to decide” what should\nlegally constitute a valid marriage under its own state\nlaws, and (2) to “lay[] down clear rules” regarding what\nconstitutes a marriage for purposes of federal law.  Id.\nat 2. \n\n13a\nIn Section 2 of DOMA, Congress, by virtue of the\nexpress grant of authority under the second sentence of\nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause, permitted a state to\ndecline to give effect to the laws of other states respect-\ning same-sex marriage.  In enacting Section 3 of DOMA,\nthe House Report explained that the statute codifies the\ndefinition of marriage set forth in “the standard law dic-\ntionary,” for purposes of federal law.  Id. at 29 (citing\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 972 (6th ed. 1990)). \nThe legislative history reveals that Congress ac-\nknowledged the constraints imposed by federalism on\nthe determination of who may marry, which has always\nbeen uniquely the province of state law.  Nonetheless,\nCongress asserted that it was not “supportive of (or\neven indifferent to) the notion of same-sex marriage,”\nand it embraced DOMA as a step toward furthering Con-\ngress’ interests in “defend[ing] the institution of tradi-\ntional heterosexual marriage.”  Id. at 12.  “Although\nDOMA drastically amended the eligibility criteria for a\nvast number of different federal benefits, rights, and\nprivileges that depend upon marital status, the relevant\ncommittees did not engage in a meaningful examination\nof the scope or effect of the law.” Gill v. Office of Per-\nsonnel Management, 699 F. Supp. 2d 374, 379 (D. Mass.\n2010).2  Although drastically altering the benefits struc-\nture based on state definitions of marriage and the fed-\neralist balance in the area of domestic relations, Con-\n2 In January 1997, the General Accounting Office issued a report\nclarifying the scope of DOMA’s effect and concluded that the law im-\nplicated at least 1,049 federal laws, including those related to entitle-\nment programs like Social Security, health benefits and taxation.  A fur-\nther study in 2004 found that 1,138 federal laws tied benefits, protec-\ntions, rights, or responsibilities to marital status.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp.\n2d at 379.\n\n14a\ngress did not hear testimony from agency heads about\nthe effect of DOMA on federal programs, or from histo-\nrians, economists, or specialists in family or child wel-\nfare.  Id. \nIt is clear and undisputed that the federal health\nbenefits Ms. Golinski seeks in trying to add her wife as\na beneficiary under her health benefits plan falls under\nthe reach of DOMA.  The Federal Employees Health\nBenefits Program (“FEHB”) is a comprehensive pro-\ngram providing health insurance for federal civilian em-\nployees and their family members.  5 U.S.C. § 8905.  The\nOPM administers the FEHB and negotiates contracts\nfor coverage with potential carriers and sets the premi-\nums for each plan.  Id., §§ 8902, 8903, 8906.  A federal\nemployee enrolled in the FEHB chooses a carrier and\nplan and may determine whether to enroll for an individ-\nual plan, named “self only,” or for “self and family” cov-\nerage which, under the OPM’s regulations, “includes all\nfamily members who are eligible to be covered by the\nenrollment.”    5  C.F.R.  §  890.302(a)(1).    Under  the\nFEHB, a “member of family” is defined as either “the\nspouse of an employee  .  .  .  [or] an unmarried depend-\nent child under 22 years of age.”  5 U.S.C. § 8901(5).  An\nemployee enrolled under an individual plan may change\nto family coverage by submitting documentation to the\nemploying office during the annual open season period\nor within sixty days of a change in family status, such as\nchange  in  marital  status.    Id.,  §  8905(f);  5  C.F.R.\n§§ 890.301(f), (g). \nWithin  sixty  days  of  her  marriage,  Ms.  Golinski\nsought to enroll her wife as a beneficiary of the family\nhealth plan.  The OPM found Ms. Cunninghis was ineli-\ngible to qualify as a member of the family because, un-\n\n15a\nder DOMA, she did not qualify as a spouse of an em-\nployee.3  The question before the Court is whether Sec-\ntion 3 of DOMA, as applied to Ms. Golinski, violates con-\nstitutional principles of equal protection. \nC. Equal  Protection  Analysis  and  Standard  of\nReview. \nThe “Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment commands that no State shall deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\nlaws, which is essentially a direction that all persons\nsimilarly  situated  should  be  treated  alike.”    City  of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985) (internal citations omitted).  Although the Fifth\n3 At the administrative appeal from the denial of benefits, Chief\nJudge Kozinski found that the FEHB statute confers on the OPM the\ndiscretion to extend health benefits to same-sex couples by interpreting\nthe terms “family members” and “member of the family” to set a floor,\nnot a ceiling, to coverage eligibility.  (SAC, Ex. B at 2-3.)  The Court\nfinds this reasoning unpersuasive. \nWhere the statute unambiguously defines a term such as “member\nof family” to mean spouse (or dependent child under 22 years old), that\ndefinition controls to the exclusion of any meaning that is not explicitly\nstated in the definition.  See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 393 n.10\n(1979); see also TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 28-29 (2001) (holding\nthat, for purposes of statutory construction, expression of one thing is\nthe exclusion of the other).  DOMA offers the same clarity and defines\n“spouse” for the purposes of determining the meaning of federal legis-\nlation as “a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” 1\nU.S.C. § 7.  Confronted with such unambiguous statutory language, the\nCourt is not persuaded that the FEHB statute could provide the OPM\nwith the discretion to provide health benefits to same-sex couples.  See\nIn re Levenson, 587 F.3d 925, 930-31 (9th Cir. 2009); Gill, 699 F. Supp.\n2d at 385-86.  This disposes of Ms. Golinski’s remaining statutory claim\nand the OPM’s motion to dismiss that claim, to the extent it is still as-\nserted, is GRANTED.\n\n16a\nAmendment to the United States Constitution does not\ncontain an Equal Protection Clause, the Fifth Amend-\nment’s Due Process Clause includes an equal protection\ncomponent.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499-500\n(1954); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976)\n(“Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment\narea is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.”).  \n“[T]he  Constitution  ‘neither  knows  nor  tolerates\nclasses among citizens.’”  Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620,\n623 (1996) (quoting Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537,\n559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting)).  This principle em-\nbodies a commitment to neutrality where the rights of\nindividual persons are at stake.  Dragovich v. United\nStates Department of the Treasury, 764 F. Supp. 2d\n1178, 1188 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Romer, 517 U.S. at\n623.)  It is because of this commitment to neutrality that\nlegislative provisions which arbitrarily or irrationally\ncreate discrete classes cannot withstand constitutional\nscrutiny.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 623.  “Equal protection of\nthe laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposi-\ntion of inequalities.”  Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629,\n635 (1950) (quoting Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22\n(1948)).  “The guaranty of ‘equal protection of the laws\nis a pledge of the protection of equal laws.’”  Skinner v.\nOklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942)\n(quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886)).\nHowever, courts must balance this mandate with the\n“practical necessity that most legislation classifies for\none purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to\nvarious groups or persons.”  Romer, 517 U.S. at 631 (ci-\ntations omitted).  The equal protection guarantee pre-\nserves a measure of power to the state and the federal\n\n17a\ngovernment to enact legislation that classifies certain\ngroups.  Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 271-72 (1979).  In an attempt to\nreconcile the promise of equal protection with the reality\nof lawmaking, courts apply the most searching constitu-\ntional scrutiny to those laws that burden a fundamental\nright or target a suspect class, such as those based on\nrace, national origin, sex or religion.  Romer, 517 U.S. at\n631.  To these groups of protected classifications, sub-\nject to a heightened scrutiny, the government is re-\nquired to demonstrate that the classification is substan-\ntially related to an important governmental objective.\nSee Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).  Laws that\ndo not burden a protected class or infringe on a constitu-\ntionally protected fundamental right are subject to ra-\ntional basis review.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 631.  Under the\nrational basis review, a law must be rationally related to\nthe furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest.\nId. (citing Heller v. Doe by Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-320\n(1993)). \nIn resolving an equal protection challenge, the Court\n“must first determine what classification has been cre-\nated” by the legislation.  Aleman v. Glickman, 217 F.3d\n1191, 1195 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Lazy Y Ranch, 546\nF.3d at 589.  The plaintiff must show that the “law is\napplied in a discriminatory manner or imposes different\nburdens on different classes of people.”  Lazy Y Ranch,\n546 F.3d at 589 (quoting Freeman v. City of Santa Ana,\n68 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir. 1995)).  The Court must\nthen ascertain the appropriate level of scrutiny to em-\n\n18a\nploy.  In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 142 (W.D. Wash.\n2004).4 \n1. Level of Scrutiny. \nHere,  DOMA  makes  distinctions  between  legally\nmarried couples, by granting benefits to opposite-sex\nmarried couples but denying benefits to same-sex mar-\nried couples.  Accordingly, DOMA treats gay and lesbian\nindividuals differently on the basis of their sexual orien-\ntation.  In order to determine whether sexual orientation\nis considered a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to\nheightened scrutiny, the Court must look at various fac-\ntors.5  The Supreme Court has considered:  (1) the his-\n4 Ms. Golinski challenges the application of DOMA because it dis-\ncriminates both on the basis of sex and on the basis of sexual orienta-\ntion. (Golinski Reply on Motion for Summary Judgment at 7-8.)  Sexual\norientation discrimination can take the form of sex discrimination.  See\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 996 (N.D. Cal. 2010)\n(“Perry”).  Here, for example, Ms. Golinski is prohibited from marrying\nMs. Cunninghis, a woman, because Ms. Golinski is a woman.  If Ms.\nGolinski were a man, DOMA would not serve to withhold benefits from\nher.  Thus, DOMA operates to restrict Ms. Golinski’s access to federal\nbenefits because of her sex.  But DOMA also operates to restrict Ms.\nGolinski’s access to federal benefits because of her sexual orientation;\nher desire to marry another woman arises only because she is a lesbian.\nAccordingly, the Court addresses the Equal Protection challenge on the\nbasis of sexual orientation.\n5 The question of whether DOMA impacts a fundamental right is ad-\ndressed briefly by the parties but it is not at issue here as it is undis-\nputed that Ms. Golinski is already married under state law.  The failure\nof the federal government to recognize Ms. Golinski’s marriage and to\nprovide benefits does not alter the fact that she is married under state\nlaw.  Thus, Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), which ostensibly ad-\n\n19a\ntory of invidious discrimination against the class bur-\ndened by the legislation; (2) whether the characteristics\nthat distinguish the class indicate a typical class mem-\nber’s ability to contribute to society; (3) whether the\ndistinguishing characteristics are “immutable” or be-\nyond the class members’ control; and (4) the political\ndressed whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry,\nis irrelevant here.  See Perry v. Brown, — F.3d —, 2012 WL 372713 at,\n*17 n.14 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Perry II”). \nHowever, it is established that there is a fundamental right to marry.\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S.\n833, 851 (1992) (“Our law affords constitutional protection to personal\ndecisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family rela-\ntionships, child rearing, and education.  .  .  .  These matters, involving\nthe most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime,\nchoices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the\nliberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.”) (citations omitted);\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95 (1987) (“[T]he decision to marry is a\nfundamental right.”); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978)\n(“[T]he right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individu-\nals.”); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (“The freedom to marry\nhas long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to\nthe orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”); Griswold v. Connecti-\ncut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965) (“Marriage is a coming together for better\nor for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being\nsacred.  It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a\nharmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial\nor social projects.”).\nThe analysis of the fundamental right to marry has not depended up-\non the characteristics of the spouse.  The Supreme Court cases address-\ning the fundamental right to marry do not define the fundamental right\nin narrow terms.  In Loving, the Court defined the fundamental right\nas the right to marry, not the right to interracial marriage.  388 U.S. at\n12.  In Turner, the fundamental right was the right to marry, not the\nright to inmate marriage.  482 U.S. at 94-96.  In Zablocki, the funda-\nmental right was the right to marry, not the right of people owing child\nsupport to marry.  434 U.S. at 383-86. \n\n20a\npower of the subject class. See Varnum v. Brien, 763\nN.W.2d 862, 887-88 (Iowa 2009) (collecting cases). \nNo single factor for determining elevated scrutiny is\ndispositive.  See Massachusetts Board of Retirement v.\nMurgia, 427 U.S. 307, 321 (1976).  The presence of any\nof the factors is a signal that the particular classification\nis “more likely than others to reflect deep-seated preju-\ndice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some\nlegitimate objective,” thus requiring heightened scru-\ntiny.  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 n.14 (1982).  The\nSupreme Court has placed far greater weight on two\nfactors: \nwhether the group has been the subject of long-\nstanding and invidious discrimination and whether\nthe group’s distinguishing characteristic bears no\nrelation to the ability of the group members to per-\nform or function in society.  In circumstances in\nwhich a group has been subject to such discrimina-\ntion and its distinguishing characteristic does not\nbear any relation to such ability, the court inevitably\nhas employed heightened scrutiny in reviewing stat-\nutory classifications targeting those groups.\nKerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, 289 Conn.\n135, 167-68 (2008). \n2. Distinguishing High Tech Gays Finding on Stan-\ndard of Review. \nBefore the Court may assess the various factors that\napply to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to\napply in this matter, the Court must address the holding\nin High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clear-\nance Office, which addresses the standard of review for\nclassifications based on sexual orientation.  895 F.2d 563,\n\n21a\n571 (9th Cir. 1990).  In High Tech Gays, decided before\nthe Supreme Court revised much of the underlying legal\npreconceptions upon which this case rests, the Ninth\nCircuit determined that the classification of homosexu-\nals lacks the indicia of a suspect or quasi-suspect cate-\ngory.  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held that the gov-\nernment need only come forth with a rational basis to\nsustain its classifications against the gay and lesbian\nminority.  Id. \nHowever, the foundations of the Ninth Circuit’s deci-\nsion in High Tech Gays have sustained serious erosion\nby  virtue  of  more  recent  decisions  by  the  Supreme\nCourt.  When the premise for a case’s holding has been\nweakened, the precedential import of the case is subject\nto question.  District courts are not governed by earlier\nappellate precedent that has been “undercut by higher\nauthority to such an extent that it has been effectively\noverruled by such higher authority.”  Miller v. Gammie,\n335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003). \nThe linchpin of the reasoning in High Tech Gays was\nthe precedent set by the Supreme Court in Bowers v.\nHardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 190 (1986), which upheld the\ncriminalization of private consensual homosexual con-\nduct.  In High Tech Gays, the Ninth Circuit concluded\nthat, based on the holding in Bowers, “because homosex-\nual conduct can  .  .  .  be criminalized, homosexuals can-\nnot constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled\nto greater than rational basis review for equal protec-\ntion purposes.”  High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 571.  Pur-\nsuant to Supreme Court precedent in Bowers, the Ninth\nCircuit agreed that “it cannot logically be asserted that\ndiscrimination against homosexuals is constitutionally\ninfirm.”  Id. at 571 n.6 (quoting Woodward v. United\n\n22a\nStates, 871 F.2d 1068, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).  The court\nconcluded that, under the holding of Bowers, it would be\nanomalous to define the conduct of members of a class as\ncriminal and also find that, as a class, they were deserv-\ning of strict or heightened scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause.  See id. (citing Padula v. Webster,\n822 F.2d 97, 103 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). \nHowever, since the decision in High Tech Gays, the\nSupreme Court has overruled Bowers, renounced its\nfundamental premise, and found that “Bowers was not\ncorrect when it was decided, and it is not correct today.”\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003).  The Law-\nrence Court found that majority’s moral condemnation\nof the intimate practices of homosexual partners does\nnot justify criminal prohibition and found those private\nconsensual  practices  are  safeguarded  by  the  liberty\nprotections afforded by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 574-75.  Therefore, the\nreasoning in High Tech Gays, that laws discriminating\nagainst gay men and lesbians are not entitled to height-\nened scrutiny because homosexual conduct may be legit-\nimately criminalized, cannot stand post-Lawrence. \nIn addition, the court in High Tech Gays, in perform-\ning the analysis of the issue of whether the legislature’s\nclassification based on homosexuality calls for height-\nened scrutiny, relied on the mistaken assumption that\nsexual orientation is merely “behavioral,” rather than\nthe sort of deeply rooted, immutable characteristic that\nwarrants  heightened  protection  from  discrimination.\nSee High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 573-74.  The court\nfound that “[h]omosexuality is not an immutable charac-\nteristic; it is behavioral and hence fundamentally differ-\nent from traits such as race, gender, or alienage, which\n\n23a\ndefine  already  existing  suspect  and  quasi-suspect\nclasses.  The behavior of such already recognized classes\nis irrelevant to their identification.”  Id. (internal cita-\ntions omitted).  The Supreme Court has since rejected\nthis artificial distinction, noting that its more recent\nprecedent “have declined to distinguish between status\nand conduct in th[e] context” of sexual orientation.  See\nChristian Legal Society v. Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971,\n2990 (2010).  In Lawrence, the Court noted that “[w]hen\nhomosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the\nState, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to\nsubject homosexual persons to discrimination.”  539 U.S.\nat 575 (emphasis added); id. at 583 (O’Connor, J., con-\ncurring in judgment) (“While it is true that the law ap-\nplies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is\nconduct that is closely correlated with being homosex-\nual.  Under such circumstances, [the] law is targeted at\nmore than conduct.  It is instead directed toward gay\npersons as a class.”).  Accordingly, the analysis of the\nNinth Circuit in High Tech Gays on the appropriateness\nof applying heightened scrutiny to gay men and lesbians\nbecause their defining characteristic is immutable has\nbeen severely undermined by more recent and overrid-\ning precedent. \nThe Court finds that the outdated holding in High\nTech Gays, subjecting gay men and lesbians to rational\nbasis  review,  is  no  longer  a  binding  precedent.  See\nMiller, 335 F.3d at 900 (finding that where an interven-\ning decision of a higher court is clearly irreconcilable\nwith a Ninth Circuit decision, “district courts should\nconsider themselves bound by the intervening higher\nauthority and reject the prior opinion of [the Ninth Cir-\ncuit] as having been effectively overruled.”). \n\n24a\n3. The Question of Level of Scrutiny is Still Open. \nThe Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have yet\nto issue binding rulings as to whether classifications\nbased  on  sexual  orientation  are  suspect  (or  quasi-\nsuspect).  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 620, 632-33 (finding\nthat it was unnecessary to look beyond rational basis\nreview because the state’s attempt to strip gay people of\nall anti-discrimination protections was “a denial of equal\nprotection in the most literal sense” and because it\n“confound[ed] and defie[d]” rational basis review.”); see\nalso, e.g., Diaz v. Brewer, 656 F.3d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir.\n2011) (“We do not need to decide whether heightened\nscrutiny might be required.”); In re Levenson, 587 F.3d\nat 931 (finding that although it is “likely that some form\nof heightened constitutional scrutiny applies  .  .  .\n[, because] the denial of benefits here cannot survive\neven rational basis review, the least searching form of\nconstitutional scrutiny  .  .  .  it is not necessary to deter-\nmine whether or which form of heightened scrutiny is\napplicable to this claim.”); Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at\n*17 (finding that, as in Romer, the court need not apply\nheightened scrutiny where the proposed legislation fails\nrational basis scrutiny); Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d at\n1189 (“Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs state a\nclaim under the rational basis standard, the question of\nwhether Plaintiffs are members of a protected class\nneed not be resolved here.”).  The majority of the Su-\npreme Court in Lawrence, although it declared unconsti-\ntutional the laws infringing on the substantive liberty\nshared by gay people to engage in sexual intimacy, did\nnot directly address what standard of review applies to\nthe classification of gay and lesbian individuals.  Law-\nrence, 539 U.S. at 558.  And the Ninth Circuit in Witt v.\nDepartment of Air Force merely found, in the context of\n\n25a\nmilitary policy where judicial deference “is at its apo-\ngee,” that the military’s policy of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell”\nwould fail even rational basis review.  527 F.3d 806, 821\n(9th Cir. 2008). \nBecause Lawrence overturned Bowers and in light of\nthe lack of precedential value of High Tech Gays, no\nfederal appellate court has meaningfully examined the\nappropriate level of scrutiny to apply to gay men and\nlesbians.  Therefore, the Court finds the question of\nwhat level of scrutiny applies to classifications based on\nsexual orientation is still open. \n4. Heightened Scrutiny Should Apply.\nThe Court undertakes to analyze the factors required\nto demonstrate whether a particular class is entitled to\nsuspect or quasi-suspect status and therefore deserving\nof heightened scrutiny. \na. History of discrimination against gay men\nand lesbians. \nThe first factor courts consider is whether the class\nhas suffered a history of discrimination.  There is no\ndispute in the record that lesbians and gay men have\nexperienced a long history of discrimination.  (See Dec-\nlaration of George Chauncey at ¶¶ 6-103; OPM Opp. Br.\nat 6-13.)  There is also no dispute that courts have found\nthat gay men and lesbians have experienced a history of\ndiscrimination.  See, e.g., High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at\n573 (acknowledging that “homosexuals have suffered a\nhistory of discrimination”); Witt, 527 F.3d at 824-25\n(noting that homosexuals have “experienced a history of\npurposeful unequal treatment”); Perry v. Proposition 8\nOfficial Proponents, 587 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir. 2009)\n\n26a\n(addressing the difficulty in denying that gay men and\nlesbians have experienced discrimination in the past in\nlight of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in High Tech Gays);\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 981-82 (acknowledging exten-\nsive  evidence  of  public  and  private  discrimination\nagainst gay men and lesbians in California and through-\nout the United States); see also In re Balas, 449 B.R.\n567, 576 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2011) (same). \nb. Ability to contribute to society. \nSimilarly, there is no dispute in the record or the law\nthat sexual orientation has no relevance to a person’s\nability to contribute to society.  See Watkins v. U.S.\nArmy, 875 F.2d 699, 725 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Sexual orien-\ntation plainly has no relevance to a person’s ability to\nperform or contribute to society.”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1002 (conclud-\ning that “by every available metric, opposite-sex couples\nare not better than their same-sex counterparts; in-\nstead, as partners, parents and citizens, opposite-sex\ncouples and same-sex couples are equal.”).  \nc. Defining or immutable characteristics. \nAnother consideration courts find relevant in deter-\nmining whether statutory provisions pertaining to a par-\nticular group are subject to heightened scrutiny includes\nwhether the characteristic that defines the members of\nthe class as a discrete group is immutable or otherwise\nnot within the members’ control.  See Lyng v. Castillo,\n477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986). \nMs. Golinski presents evidence that the characteris-\ntic of sexual orientation is immutable or highly resistant\nto change.  (See Declaration of Lisa Diamond at ¶¶ 10,\n13; Declaration of Letitia Anne Peplau at ¶¶ 21, 26; Rita\n\n27a\nLin Reply Declaration (“Lin Reply Decl.”), Ex. G.)  Fur-\nther, the consensus in the scientific community is that\nsexual orientation is an immutable characteristic.  See,\ne.g., G.M. Herek, et al. Demographic, Psychological,\nand Social Characteristics of Self-Identified Lesbian,\nGay, and Bisexual Adults, 7, 176-200 (2010) (noting that\nin a national survey, 95 percent of gay men and 83 per-\ncent of lesbian women reported that they experienced\n“no choice at all” or “very little choice” about their sex-\nual orientation); see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 966\n(“No credible evidence supports a finding that an indi-\nvidual may, through conscious decision, therapeutic in-\ntervention or any other method, change his or her sexual\norientation.”) \nBLAG presents evidence demonstrating that there is\nsome fluidity on the continuum of sexuality for some\nindividuals who identify themselves as gay or lesbian.\n(See Declaration of Conor B. Dugan (“Dugan Decl.”),\nEx. B at 36:14-38, Ex. 4, Ex. E at 320.)  The evidence\nindicates that a very small minority of the gay and les-\nbian population may experience a small amount of choice\nin their sexuality.  (Id.)  However, the vast majority of\nthose who self-reported as gay or lesbian did not experi-\nence attraction to the opposite sex at any time.  (See\nFurther Declaration of Letitia Anne Peplau at ¶ 6 (“data\nshow that only 1/2 of 1% of the male participants and\n1.3% of the female participants shifted from only oppo-\nsite sex attraction to major attraction to the same sex or\nvice versa.”)).  \nHowever, regardless of the evidence that a tiny per-\ncentage of gay men or lesbians may experience some\nflexibility along the continuum of their sexuality or the\nscientific consensus that sexual orientation is unchange-\n\n28a\nable, the Court finds persuasive the holding in the Ninth\nCircuit that sexual orientation is recognized as a defin-\ning and immutable characteristic because it is so funda-\nmental to one’s identity.  “Sexual orientation and sexual\nidentity are immutable; they are so fundamental to one’s\nidentity that a person should not be required to abandon\nthem.”  Hernandez-Montiel v. Immigration and Natu-\nralization Service, 225 F.3d 1084, 1093 (9th Cir. 2000),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Thomas v. Gon-\nzales, 409 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Karouni v.\nGonzales, 399 F.3d 1163, 1173 (9th Cir. 2005) (agreeing\nwith Hernandez-Montiel and finding that homosexuality\nis “a fundamental aspect of  .  .  .  human identity”);\nWatkins, 875 F.2d at 726 (Norris, J., concurring) (find-\ning that the prong of suspectness inquiry is satisfied\nwhen the identifying trait is “so central to a person’s\nidentity that it would be abhorrent for government to\npenalize a person for refusing to change [it]”); In re\nMarriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757, 842 (2008) (“Because a\nperson’s sexual orientation is so integral an aspect of\none’s identity, it is not appropriate to require a person\nto repudiate or change his or her sexual orientation in\norder to avoid discriminatory treatment.”)  The Court\nfinds that a person’s sexual orientation is so fundamen-\ntal to one’s identity that a person should not be required\nto abandon it.  Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of\nthe application of heightened scrutiny.6\n6 In addition, immutability is not an absolute prerequisite to height-\nened scrutiny.  The Supreme Court has granted suspect class status to\ngroups whose distinguishing characteristic is not immutable.  See, e.g.,\nNyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9 n.11 (1977) (rejecting immutability re-\nquirements in treating group of resident aliens as suspect class despite\ntheir ability to opt out of class voluntarily); see also Miller v. Albright,\n523 U.S. 420, 431 (1998) (recognizing that because a child born out of\n\n29a\nd. Minority status and political powerlessness.\nThe final consideration employed by courts to deter-\nmine whether a subject group deserves heightened con-\nstitutional scrutiny is whether the subject group is “a\nminority or politically powerless.”  Bowen v. Gilliard,\n483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987); see also San Antonio Inde-\npendent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28\n(1973) (concluding that a class comprising poor families\nexhibits none of the “traditional indicia of suspectness”\nbecause class is not “saddled with such disabilities, or\nsubjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treat-\nment, or relegated to such a position of political power-\nlessness as to command extraordinary protection from\nthe majoritarian political process.”)  This factor exam-\nines relative political power and seeks to answer the\nquestion whether the “discrimination is unlikely to be\nsoon rectified by legislative means.”  City of Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 440.7 \nwedlock may be “legitimated” by father, strictly speaking illegitimacy\nis not an immutable characteristic); see also New Orleans v. Dukes, 427\nU.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam) (finding religious identification and\nalienage, despite being changeable, to constitute suspect classes). \n7 In High Tech Gays, the Ninth Circuit briefly addressed the factor\nof political powerlessness:  “legislatures have addressed and continue\nto address the discrimination suffered by homosexuals on account of\ntheir sexual orientation through the passage of anti-discrimination leg-\nislation.  Thus, homosexuals are not without political power; they have\nthe ability to and do ‘attract the attention of lawmakers,’ as evidenced\nby such legislation.”  895 F.2d at 574 (citing City of Cleburne, 473 U.S.\nat 445).  However, the very circumstance of gay men and lesbians being\nrequired to defend their interests against legislative action is a reflec-\ntion of relative political weakness.  (Declaration of Gary Segura (“Se-\ngura Decl.”) at ¶ 14.)  In addition, the standard is not whether a minor-\nity group is entirely powerless, but rather whether they suffer from\nrelative political weakness.  See Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 28; City of\n\n30a\nThere is no dispute in the record that gay men and\nlesbians are a minority of the population in the United\nStates.  (See Dugan Decl., Ex. A at 13:12-14, Ex. B at\n19:2-7.)  The only issue is whether the minority is politi-\ncally vulnerable or lacking in power.  The Court has re-\nviewed the evidence submitted by the parties for consid-\neration on this factor.  \nBLAG argues that the current Administration’s re-\nversal of position with regard to defending DOMA in\nvarious courts nationwide is evidence that gay and les-\nbian individuals have achieved political power.  BLAG\ncontends that the decision followed President Obama’s\nreceipt of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign\nseeking to change the Administration’s position.  (BLAG\nOpp. Br. at 12.)  However, this contention is not sup-\nported by the evidence in the record.  First, this letter\nwas sent nearly two years prior to the announcement of\nthe Administration’s current opinion.  (Lin Reply Decl.,\nEx. H at 166:16-167:13.)  Second, the Department of\nJustice functions under an independent obligation to\nassess  the  constitutionality  of  a  statute  it  has  been\ntasked to defend.  By its own terms, the announcement\nby the Department of Justice was based not on a politi-\ncal calculation, but rather was an independent assess-\nment of the constitutionality of DOMA.  (See NSA, Ex.\n1 at 1-2.)  The contention that a two-year-old letter from\na gay rights advocacy group was the pivotal consider-\nation in the Administration’s reassessment of the law or\nthat it demonstrates that gay men and lesbians have\npolitical power is speculative at best. \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 445. \n\n31a\nBLAG also argues that a “spate of recent news sto-\nries only confirms the conclusion that homosexuals are\nfar from politically powerless.”  (BLAG Opp. Br. at 12.)\nBLAG lists the nomination of four openly-gay judges,\nthe laws in several states legalizing gay marriage, and\nthe campaign against Proposition 8 in California which\ngarnered  significant  funding  from  proponents  of\nsame-sex marriage.  (Id. at 12-15.) \nThe recent articles BLAG cites are exceptions and\nnot the rule.  While President Obama nominated four\nopenly-gay judges, there are literally hundreds of fed-\neral judges nationwide.  Only a handful of states have\nsuccessfully passed legislation legalizing same-sex mar-\nriage, and only a few more have been required to afford\nequal  marital  rights  to  gay  and  lesbian  individuals\nthrough judicial decisions.  Thirty states have passed\nconstitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage.\n(See OPM Opp. Br. at 15, citing National Conference of\nState Legislatures, Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions\nand Domestic Partnerships, available at http://www.\nncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid_16430 (last updated Febru-\nary 13, 2012)).  In contrast, when the Supreme Court\nruled  in  Loving,  interracial  marriage  was  legal  in\nthirty-four states.  See Loving, 388 U.S. at 6.  Moreover,\nthere is no federal anti-discrimination legislation and no\nprotection in most states from sexual orientation dis-\ncrimination.  (See OPM Opp. Br. at 6-12.)  Finally, while\nthe campaign against Proposition 8 may have raised sig-\nnificant funds, the majority of Californians still voted to\nalter the state constitution to strip gay and lesbian indi-\nviduals of their rights.  Placed in context, BLAG’s evi-\ndence does not create a question of fact. \n\n32a\nDespite the modest successes in remediating existing\ndiscrimination, the record demonstrates that gay men\nand lesbians continue to suffer discrimination “unlikely\nto be rectified by legislative means.”  City of Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 440.  Even BLAG, in similar litigation, has\nadmitted that “gay men and lesbians often must rely on\njudicial decisions to secure equal rights.”  (Lin Reply\nDecl., Exs. C and D at ¶ 32.)  Ms. Golinski proffers the\nundisputed  and  extensive  expert  testimony  of  Gary\nSegura for the proposition that gay men and lesbians\nlack a meaningful degree of political power.  (See Segura\nDecl. at ¶¶ 9-85.)  In sum, the basic inability to bring\nabout an end to discrimination and pervasive prejudice,\nto secure desired policy outcomes and to prevent unde-\nsirable outcomes on fundamental matters that directly\nimpact their lives, is evidence of the relative political\npowerlessness of gay and lesbian individuals.  (Id. at\n¶ 28.) \nMs. Golinski also proffers the letter from the Attor-\nney General to Congress regarding DOMA and the De-\npartment of Justice’s determination that it would no\nlonger provide a defense of a statute which it considered\nto be unconstitutional.  (See NSA, Ex. 2.)  In the letter,\nthe Attorney General, speaking on behalf of the Execu-\ntive, notes that “the adoption of the laws like those at\nissue in Romer and Lawrence, the longstanding ban on\ngay men and lesbians in the military, and the absence of\nfederal protection for employment discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation show the group to have lim-\nited political power and ‘ability to attract the [favorable]\nattention of the lawmakers.’”  (Id. at 2, citing City of\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.) \n\n33a\nThe Court finds that the unequivocal evidence dem-\nonstrates that, although not completely politically pow-\nerless, the gay and lesbian community lacks meaningful\npolitical power.  In 1985, in their dissent from a petition\nfor writ of certiorari, Justices Brennan and Marshall\nfound that “homosexuals constitute a significant and\ninsular minority of this country’s population.  Because of\nthe immediate and severe opprobrium often manifested\nagainst homosexuals once so identified publicly, mem-\nbers of this group are particularly powerless to pursue\ntheir rights openly in the political arena.”  Rowland v.\nMad River Local School District, 470 U.S. 1009, 1014\n(1985).  The Court agrees and finds that, as a class, gay\nmen and lesbians are a minority and have relatively lim-\nited political power to attract the favorable attention of\nlawmakers.  See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.  Al-\nthough this factor is not an absolute prerequisite for\nheightened scrutiny, the Court finds the evidence and\nthe law support the conclusion that gay men and lesbi-\nans remain a politically vulnerable minority.  See Plyler,\n457 U.S. at 216 n.14; Murgia, 427 U.S. at 321. \nHere, having analyzed the factors, the Court holds\nthat the appropriate level of scrutiny to use when re-\nviewing statutory classifications based on sexual orien-\ntation is heightened scrutiny.  See also In re Levenson,\n587 F.3d at 931 (holding that “some form of heightened\nconstitutional  scrutiny  applies”);  Witt,  527  F.3d  at\n824-25 (Canby, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (“classifications against homosexuals are suspect\nin the equal protection sense” as gay and lesbian individ-\nuals have “experienced a history of purposeful unequal\ntreatment [and] been subjected to unique disabilities on\nthe basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indica-\ntive of their abilities” and “they also exhibit obvious,\n\n34a\nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define\nthem as a discrete group; and they are a minority.”).  In\nshort, this Court holds that gay men and lesbians are a\ngroup deserving of heightened protection against the\nprejudices and power of an often-antagonistic majority.\nSee id. at 825. \n5. Application of Heightened Scrutiny to Justifica-\ntions Proffered for DOMA.\nUnder heightened scrutiny, the proponents of the\nstatute must establish, at a minimum, that the classifica-\ntion is “substantially related to an important govern-\nmental objective.”  Clark, 486 U.S. at 461.  Moreover,\nunder any form of heightened scrutiny, the statute may\nonly be defended by reference to the actual legislative\nbases advanced to legitimate the statute or the “actual\n[governmental] purpose, not rationalizations for actions\nin fact differently grounded.”  United States v. Virginia,\n518 U.S. 515, 535-36 (1996).  The Court notes that the\n“historical background of the decision” to enact legisla-\ntion and the “specific sequence of events leading up to\nthe challenged decision” may shed light on the decision-\nmakers’ purposes.  See Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n267 (1977).  Here, the legislative history is replete with\nexpressed animus toward gay men and lesbians. \nThe House Report on DOMA reflected Congress’\n“moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral con-\nviction that heterosexuality better comports with tradi-\ntional (especially Judeo-Christian) morality.”  H.R. Rep.\nNo. 104-664, at 16 (footnote omitted).  In his expression\nof these objectives, Henry Hyde, then-Chairman of the\nHouse Judiciary Committee, stated that “[m]ost people\ndo not approve of homosexual conduct  .  .  .  and they\n\n35a\nexpress  their  disapprobation  through  the  law.”  142\nCong. Rec. H7480 (daily ed. July 12, 1996). \nIn the floor debate, members of Congress repeatedly\nexpressed their disapprobation of homosexuality, calling\nit “immoral,” “depraved,” “unnatural,” “based on perver-\nsion,” and “an attack upon God’s principles.”  142 Cong.\nRec. H7444 (daily ed. July 11, 1996) (statement of Rep.\nCoburn); 142 Cong. Rec. H7486 (daily ed. July 12, 1996)\n(statement of Rep. Buyer); id. at H7494 (statement of\nRep. Smith).  Members of Congress argued that mar-\nriage by gay men and lesbians would “demean” and\n“trivialize” heterosexual marriage and might indeed be\n“the final blow to the American family.”  142 Cong. Rec.\nH7276  (daily  ed.  July  11,  1996)  (statement  of  Rep.\nLargent); 142 Cong. Rec. H7495 (daily ed. July 12, 1996)\n(statement of Rep. Lipinski) (“Allowing for gay mar-\nriages would be the final straw, it would devaluate the\nlove between a man and a woman and weaken us as a\nNation.”).  Senator Helms, in a statement prepared for\nthe hearing, expressed his disapprobation:  “[Those op-\nposed to DOMA] are demanding that homosexuality be\nconsidered as just another lifestyle—these are the peo-\nple who seek to force their agenda upon the vast major-\nity of Americans who reject the homosexual lifestyle\n.  .  .  Homosexuals and lesbians boast that they are close\nto realizing their goal—legitimizing their behavior  .  .  .\nAt the heart of this debate is the moral and spiritual\nsurvival of this Nation.”  142 Cong. Rec. S10,110 (daily\ned. Sept. 10, 1996); see also 142 Cong. Rec. H7275 (daily\ned. July 11, 1996) (statement of Rep. Barr) (stating that\nmarriage is “under direct assault by the homosexual\nextremists all across the country.”).  The House Report\non the pending DOMA bill stated:  “Civil laws that per-\nmit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a col-\n\n36a\nlective moral judgment about human sexuality.  This\njudgment entails [a] moral disapproval of homosexual-\nity.”  H.R. Rep. 104-664, at 15-16.  The Report further\nstated that “same-sex marriage, if sanctified by the law,\nif approved by the law, legitimates a public union, a legal\nstatus that most people  .  .  .  feel ought to be illegiti-\nmate.”  Id. at 16. \nDespite the expressed animus against gay men and\nlesbians within the legislative history of DOMA, Con-\ngress also specifically identified four governmental in-\nterests to be advanced by the statute:  (1) encouraging\nresponsible procreation and child-rearing; (2) defending\nand nurturing the institution of traditional, heterosexual\nmarriage; (3) defending traditional notions of morality;\nand (4) preserving scarce government resources.  See\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 12-18. \na. Responsible procreation and child-rearing. \nThe first reason proffered by Congress when enact-\ning DOMA was to encourage responsible procreation\nand child-rearing. \nMs. Golinski presents evidence that it is “beyond\nscientific dispute” that same-sex parents are equally\ncapable at parenting as opposite-sex parents.  (See Dec-\nlaration of Michael Lamb (“Lamb Decl.”) at ¶ 14.)  The\nevidence presented by Professor Lamb demonstrates\nthat parents’ genders are irrelevant to children’s devel-\nopmental outcomes.  (See id. at ¶¶ 28, 38; Reply Decla-\nration of Michael Lamb (“Lamb Reply Decl.”) at ¶¶ 8,\n19, 28.)  More than thirty years of scholarship resulting\nin over fifty peer-reviewed empirical reports have over-\nwhelmingly demonstrated that children raised by same-\nsex parents are as likely to be emotionally healthy, and\neducationally and socially successful as those raised by\n\n37a\nopposite-sex parents.  (See Lamb Decl. at ¶¶ 29-32.)\n“There is  .  .  .  no empirical support for the notion that\nthe presence of both male and female role models in the\nhome promotes children’s adjustment or well-being.”\n(Id. at ¶ 14.)  “Since the enactment of DOMA, a consen-\nsus has developed among the medical, psychological and\nsocial welfare communities that children raised by gay\nand lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted\nas those raised by heterosexual parents.”  Gill, 699 F.\nSupp. 2d at 388; see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1000\n(“The evidence does not support a finding that Califor-\nnia has an interest in preferring opposite-sex parents\nover same-sex parents. Indeed, the evidence shows be-\nyond any doubt that parents’ genders are irrelevant to\nchildren’s  developmental  outcomes.”);  Varnum,  763\nN.W.2d at 899 n.26 (“The research appears to strongly\nsupport the conclusion that same-sex couples foster the\nsame wholesome environment as opposite-sex couples\nand suggests that the traditional notion that children\nneed a mother and a father to be raised into healthy,\nwell-adjusted adults is based more on stereotype than\nanything else.”). \nBLAG argues that there are flaws in the studies\nproffered by Ms. Golinski’s expert, Professor Lamb,\ncomparing gay or lesbian parents to opposite-sex par-\nents, based on methodological challenges.  The first al-\nleged flaw is that there have been fewer studies of gay\nmale parents than there have been of lesbian family re-\nsearch.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 7; see also Lin Re-\nply Decl., Ex. K at 76:6-17.)  Whether this is the case\ndoes not impact the validity of the studies performed.\n(See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 8.)  The second flaw as ar-\ngued by BLAG is that there are fewer studies on adoles-\ncents than on younger children.  However, it remains\n\n38a\nundisputed that “there are several  .  .  .  studies that\nhave looked at adolescent offspring living with same-sex\nparents” and those studies have “uniformly reported\npositive outcomes.”  (See id. at ¶¶ 9-10; see also Lin Re-\nply Decl., Ex. K at 82:15-83:21.)  The third criticism is\nthat Professor Lamb indicates the need for further stud-\nies.  This does not impact the validity of the studies al-\nready performed.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 12.)  The\nCourt finds that these criticisms of the studies relied\nupon by Professor Lamb do not alter their validity.\n“[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge’s function\nis not  .  .  .  to weigh the evidence and determine the\ntruth of the matter but to determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.”  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249.\nThe Court finds BLAG’s critique does not create an is-\nsue of fact. \nFurther, BLAG cites three sources for the proposi-\ntion that same-sex parenting is inferior to opposite-sex\nparenting.  One is an article from Slate.com in which the\nauthor contends that the existing science is methodologi-\ncally flawed and ideologically skewed.  (See Ann Hul-\nbert, The Gay Science:  What Do We Know About the\nEffects of Same-Sex Parenting?, Slate (Mar. 12, 2004),\navailable at http://www.slate.com/id/2097048/.)  This is\na three-page, non-scientific article by an author with no\nprofessional expertise in child development, published\nby a popular online magazine without peer review.  (See\nLamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 15.)  Another reference by BLAG\nis an article criticizing the sampling size in the studies\nrelied upon by Professor Lamb.  As Professor Lamb\nexplains, such sampling is typical of psychological re-\nsearch and a number of the studies he relied upon do use\nrepresentative sampling.  (See id. at ¶ 16.)  The last\nsource  is  an  unpublished  piece  by  Professor  Loren\n\n39a\nMarks in which he criticizes a brief issued by the Ameri-\ncan Psychological Association in 2005 concluding that\nsocial science research indicates that gay parents pro-\nvide a home environment equally likely to support chil-\ndren’s psychological and social growth.  (See BLAG Opp.\nBr., Ex. 2.)  The critique is neither a study nor published\nin a peer-reviewed journal and its questionable analysis\nis based on outdated and selectively-chosen data.  (See\nLamb Reply Decl. at ¶¶ 20-27.)  The piece also ignores\nmany of the studies relied upon by Professor Lamb re-\ngarding the conclusion that parents’ sexual orientation\nis unrelated to their children’s adjustment.  (See id. at\n¶¶ 21-27.)  Having reviewed the evidence presented, the\nCourt concludes that all three publications merely criti-\ncize the studies relied upon Professor Lamb.  As stated\nabove, the criticism merely goes to the weight of Ms.\nGolinski’s evidence.  The publications do not present any\nindependent affirmative evidence necessary to create a\ngenuine issue of disputed fact regarding whether same-\nsex married couples function as responsible parents. \nFurthermore, to the extent Congress was interested\nmerely  in  encouraging  responsible  procreation  and\nchild-rearing by opposite-sex married couples, a desire\nto encourage opposite-sex couples to procreate and raise\ntheir own children well would not provide a legitimate\nreason for denying federal recognition of same-sex mar-\nriages.  The denial of recognition and withholding of\nmarital benefits to same-sex couples does nothing to\nsupport  opposite-sex  parenting,  but  rather  merely\nserves to endanger children of same-sex parents by de-\nnying them “‘the immeasurable advantages that flow\nfrom the assurance of a stable family structure,’ when\nafforded equal recognition under federal law.”  Gill, 699\nF. Supp. 2d at 389 (quoting Goodridge v. Department of\n\n40a\nPublic Health, 440 Mass. 309, 335 (2003)).  It is undis-\nputed that same-sex parents can and do have and adopt\nchildren.    The  denial  of  federal  recognition  of  valid\nsame-sex marriages under state law does not alter pa-\nrental rights under state law.  Rather, the passage of\nDOMA only serves to undermine providing a stable en-\nvironment  for  children  of  same-sex  married  couples\nwhose children would otherwise be raised in a household\nbestowed with all of the federal benefits of marriage,\nincluding financial support and social recognition.  (See\nLamb Decl. at ¶ 42.) \nFurthermore, an interest in promoting procreation\nwithin marriage cannot provide a legitimate reason to\nexclude same-sex marriages from federal recognition.\nThe ability to procreate cannot and has never been a\nprecondition to marriage.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605\n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating “what justification could\nthere possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to\nhomosexual couples  .  .  .  [s]urely not the encourage-\nment of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are\nallowed to marry”).  “While it is certainly true that\nmany, perhaps most, married couples have children to-\ngether (assisted or unassisted), it is the exclusive and\npermanent commitment of the marriage partners to one\nanother, not the begetting of children, that is the sine\nqua non of civil marriage.”  Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1190 (citing Goodridge, 440 Mass. at 332).  The fed-\neral government has never considered withdrawing its\nrecognition of marriage based on an ability or inability\nto procreate.  See id.; see also Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at\n389.  Even if this could be considered a legitimate inter-\nest, denying federal recognition of and withholding fed-\neral benefits from legally married same-sex couples does\n\n41a\nnothing to encourage or discourage opposite-sex couples\nfrom having children within marriage.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the first proffered\nreason for the passage of DOMA—to encourage respon-\nsible procreation and child-rearing—does not provide a\njustification that is substantially related to an important\ngovernmental objective. \nb. Nurturing  the  institution  of  traditional,\nopposite-sex marriage. \nThe second reason proffered by Congress when pass-\ning DOMA, was its asserted interest in defending and\nnurturing traditional, opposite-sex marriage.  Tradition\nalone, however, cannot form an adequate justification\nfor a law.  See Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 239\n(1970); Romer, 517 U.S. at 635; Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n579.  The “ancient lineage” of a classification does not\nrender it legitimate.  Heller, 509 U.S. at 327.  Instead,\nthe government must have an interest separate and\napart from the fact of tradition itself.  \nIn addition, the ostensible governmental objective of\nfostering opposite-sex marriages remains unaffected by\nthe passage of DOMA.  DOMA does nothing to encour-\nage same-sex married individuals to marry members of\nthe opposite sex because they are already married to a\nmember of the same sex.  Nor does the denial of benefits\nto same-sex couples do anything to encourage oppo-\nsite-sex couples to get married.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp.\n2d at 389; see also In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at 932\n(“gays and lesbians will not be encouraged to enter into\nmarriages with members of the opposite sex by the gov-\nernment’s denial of benefits to same-sex spouses, and\nthe denial will not discourage same-sex couples from\n\n42a\nentering into same-sex marriages; so, the denial cannot\nbe said to ‘nurture’ or ‘defend’ the institution of hetero-\nsexual marriage.”); see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at\n972 (“Permitting same-sex couples to marry will not\naffect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry,\ndivorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage or\notherwise  affect  the  stability  of  opposite-sex  mar-\nriages.”). \nAccordingly, the Court does not find that the second\nproffered reason for the passage of DOMA—to defend\nand nurture the institution of traditional, opposite-sex\nmarriage—provides a justification that is substantially\nrelated to an important governmental objective. \nc. Defending traditional notions of morality. \nThe third reason proffered by Congress when pass-\ning DOMA was its asserted interest in defending tradi-\ntional notions of morality.  Basing legislation on moral\ndisapproval of same-sex couples does not pass any level\nof scrutiny.  “The animus toward, and moral rejection of,\nhomosexuality and same-sex relationships are apparent\nin the Congressional record.”  See Dragovich, 764 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1190.  “[M]oral condemnation of homosexu-\nality [does not] provide the requisite justification for the\nDOMA’s section three.  The ‘bare desire to harm a polit-\nically unpopular group’ is not a legitimate [governmen-\ntal] interest.”  Id. (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 634-35).\nThe condemnation of homosexuality as immoral \nhas been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of\nright and acceptable behavior, and respect for the\ntraditional family.  For many persons these are not\ntrivial concerns but profound and deep convictions\naccepted as ethical and moral principles to which\n\n43a\nthey aspire and which thus determine the course of\ntheir lives.  .  .  .  The issue is whether the majority\nmay use the power of the [government] to enforce\nthese views on the whole society through operation\nof the  .  .  .  law. \nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 571.  The Court concludes it can\nnot.  The imposition of subjective moral beliefs of a ma-\njority upon a minority cannot provide a justification for\nthe legislation.  The obligation of the Court is “to define\nthe liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.”\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 850.  “Moral disapproval of a group\ncannot be a legitimate governmental interest under the\nEqual Protection Clause because legal classifications\nmust not be ‘drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging\nthe group burdened by the law.’”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n582 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (quoting Romer, 517 U.S.\nat 633).  “[T]he fact that the governing majority  .  .  .\nhas traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral\nis not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting\nthe practice; neither history nor tradition could save a\nlaw prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional at-\ntack.”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577-78. \nAccordingly, the Court does not find that the third\nproffered reason for the passage of DOMA—to defend\ntraditional notions of morality—provides a justification\nthat is substantially related to an important governmen-\ntal objective. \nd. Preserving scarce government resources. \nThe final reason proffered by Congress for passing\nDOMA was the preservation of scarce government re-\nsources.  However, there is no evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that the provision of federal benefits to\n\n44a\nsame-sex married couples would adversely affect the\ngovernment fisc.  In addition, the preservation of gov-\nernment resources cannot, as a matter of law, justify\nbarring some arbitrarily chosen group from a govern-\nment program.  Plyler, 457 at 227, 229.  “[A]lhough effi-\ncacious administration of governmental programs is not\nwithout some importance, ‘the Constitution recognizes\nhigher values than speed and efficiency.’”  Frontiero v.\nRichardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690 (1973) (citing Stanley v.\nIllinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656 (1972)).  Under heightened\nscrutiny, convenience and economic efficiency in the\nadministration of governmental programs do not legiti-\nmize differential treatment.  See id. at 690-91. \nAccordingly, the Court does not find that the fourth\nproffered reason for the passage of DOMA—to preserve\nscarce government resources—provides a justification\nthat is substantially related to an important governmen-\ntal objective. \nThe Court concludes that, based on the justifications\nproffered by Congress for its passage of DOMA, the\nstatute fails to satisfy heightened scrutiny and is uncon-\nstitutional as applied to Ms. Golinski. \nD. In the Alternative, DOMA Fails Under Rational\nBasis Review. \nAlthough the Court finds that DOMA is subject to\nand fails to satisfy heightened scrutiny, it notes that\nnumerous courts have found that the statute fails even\nrational basis review. \n1. Standards for Rational Basis Scrutiny. \nWhere a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor\ntargets a suspect class, a court shall uphold the legisla-\n\n45a\ntive classification so long as it bears a rational relation\nto some legitimate end.  Heller, 509 U.S. at 319-320.\nUnder the rational basis standard of review, legislative\nenactments are accorded a strong presumption of valid-\nity.  Id.  Courts “are compelled under rational-basis re-\nview to accept a legislature’s generalizations even where\nthere is an imperfect fit between means and ends.”  Id.\n(internal citations omitted).  Indeed, a court applying\nrational basis review may “go so far as to hypothesize\nabout potential motivations of the legislature, in order\nto find a legitimate government interest sufficient to\njustify the challenged provision.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d\nat 387 (citing Shaw v. Oregon Public Employees’ Retire-\nment Board, 887 F.2d 947, 948-49 (9th Cir. 1989) (inter-\nnal quotation omitted)).  “In areas of social and economic\npolicy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds\nalong suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitu-\ntional rights must be upheld against equal protection\nchallenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of\nfacts that could provide a rational basis for the classifica-\ntion.”  FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S.\n307, 313 (1993). Rational basis review is “a paradigm of\njudicial restraint” and “is not a license for courts to\njudge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choic-\nes.”  Id. at 313-14.  “Nor does it authorize ‘the judiciary\n[to] sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or de-\nsirability of legislative policy determinations made in\nareas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed\nalong suspect lines.’”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 319 (quoting\nDukes, 427 U.S. at 303). \n“‘[T]he burden of establishing the unconstitutionality\nof a statute rests on him who assails it.’”  Baker v. Carr,\n369 U.S. 186, 266 (1962) (quoting Metropolitan Casualty\nIns. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 584 (1935)).  The bur-\n\n46a\nden is to “‘negative every conceivable basis which might\nsupport it,’ whether or not the basis has a foundation in\nthe record.”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 320-21 (quoting Lehn-\nhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 364\n(1973)).  “A classification does not fail rational-basis re-\nview because it ‘is not made with mathematical nicety or\nbecause in practice it results in some inequality.’”  Id. at\n321 (quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485\n(1970)).  “The problems of government are practical\nones and may justify, if they do not require, rough ac-\ncommodations—illogical, it may be, and unscientific.”\nId. (citing Metropolis Theatre Co. v. City of Chicago, 228\nU.S. 61, 69-70 (1913)).  “A statutory discrimination will\nnot be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be\nconceived to justify it.”  Id. (citing McGowan v. Mary-\nland, 366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961)).  \nHowever,  rational  review  is  not  “toothless.”\nMathews v. de Castro, 429 U.S. 181, 185 (1976).  “A stat-\nutory classification fails rational-basis review only when\nit ‘rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement\nof the State’ s objective.’”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 324 (quot-\ning Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 71\n(1978)).  Rational basis review requires that the legisla-\ntion not be enacted for arbitrary or improper purposes.\nIn order for a law to be legitimate, it must be “properly\ncognizable” by the government asserting it and “rele-\nvant to interests” it “has the authority to implement.”\nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441.  The law must bear a\nlogical relationship to the purpose it purports to ad-\nvance.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33; see also Gill, 699\nF. Supp. 2d at 387.  “[E]ven in the ordinary equal pro-\ntection case calling for the most deferential of stan-\ndards, [courts] insist on knowing the relation between\nthe classification adopted and the object to be attained.”\n\n47a\nGill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 387 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at\n633).  Lastly, the justification for the law may not rely\non factual assumptions that exceed the bounds of ratio-\nnal speculation.  Lewis v. Thompson, 252 F.3d 567, 590\n(2d Cir. 2001) (citing Heller, 509 U.S. at 320 (holding\nthat speculation, while permissible, must be “rational”)). \nWhen applying rational basis review to a classifica-\ntion that adversely affects an unpopular group, courts\napply a “more searching” rational basis review.  Diaz,\n656 F.3d at 1012.  With these protections, courts may\nthereby “ensure that classifications are not drawn for\nthe purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by\nthe law.”  Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (citing Railroad Re-\ntirement  Board  v.  Fritz,  449  U.S.  166,  181  (1980)\n(Stevens, J., concurring) (“If the adverse impact on the\ndisfavored class is an apparent aim of the legislature, its\nimpartiality would be suspect.”)). \n2. Application of Rational Basis Review to Justifi-\ncations Proffered by Congress. \nThe Court has already addressed the four interests\nproffered by Congress during the passage of DOMA and\nfound them not to be substantially related to an impor-\ntant governmental objective.  Similarly, under the ratio-\nnal basis review, the Court finds that none of Congress’\nproffered justifications constitute a rational relation in\nfurtherance of some legitimate governmental end.  See\nRomer,  517  U.S.  at  631  (citing  Heller,  509  U.S.  at\n319-320). \nSpecifically, the Court finds that Congress’ justifica-\ntion of promoting traditional notions of morality does\nnot satisfy rational basis scrutiny.  See Lawrence, 539\n\n48a\nU.S. at 582 (holding that “[m]oral disapproval of [homo-\nsexuals], like a bare desire to harm the group, is an in-\nterest that is insufficient to satisfy rational basis review\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.”)  Also, if the denial\nof benefits is designed to defend traditional notions of\nmorality by discouraging same-sex marriage, “it does so\nonly by punishing same-sex couples who exercise their\nrights under state law, and thus exhibits the ‘bare desire\nto harm’ same-sex couples.”  In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\n932 (emphasis in original).  This is forbidden by the Con-\nstitution.  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 634-35.  “Discouraging\ngay marriage serves only to force gay couples to live in\na ‘state of sin’ rather than in a lawfully-recognized ‘state\nof connubial bliss’ that encourages a long-enduring per-\nmanent relationship that, in turn, serves as the basis of\na state-recognized family.”  In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\n932.  The promotion of morality is not a cognizable gov-\nernmental interest furthered by the denial of federal\nbenefits and protections. \nSimilarly, the Court does not find the justification of\npreserving the government fisc satisfies rational basis\nreview.  See Lyng v. International Union, 485 U.S. 360,\n376-77 (1988) (holding that previous cases make “clear\nthat something more than an invocation of the public fisc\nis necessary to demonstrate the rationality of selecting\n[one group], rather than some other group, to suffer the\nburden of cost-cutting legislation.”).  Ostensible savings\nto the government fisc that depends upon “distinguish-\ning between homosexual and heterosexual [couples],\nsimilarly situated,  .  .  .  cannot survive rational basis\nreview.”  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1014.8 \n8 During oral argument, counsel for BLAG argued that another\npossible justification for DOMA, somewhat related to protection of the\n\n49a\na. Responsible procreation and child-rearing. \nIn arguing its defense of DOMA, BLAG, for the most\npart, eschews the justifications proffered by Congress\nfor the legislation. However, the group does reiterate\nthe legislative justifications of encouraging responsible\nprocreation and child-rearing and the government’s in-\nterest in defending and nurturing the institution of tra-\nditional, heterosexual marriage. \nThe Court does not find the justification of encourag-\ning responsible procreation and child-rearing survives\nrational basis scrutiny.  Even if the Court were to accept\nas true, which it does not, that opposite-sex parenting is\nsomehow superior to same-sex parenting, DOMA is not\nrationally related to this alleged governmental interest.\nUnder rational basis review, although the fit between\nthe classification and the stated government interest\nneed not be perfect, the classification must be “narrow\nenough in scope and grounded in sufficient factual con-\ntext  .  .  .  to ascertain some relation between the classi-\nfication and the purpose it serve[s].”  Romer, 517 U.S. at\n632-33.  Rational basis review invalidates a measure\npublic fisc, is “to rationally maintain bargains that were decided upon\nby previous Congresses.  .  .  .  There were bargains made, and there\nwere calculus [sic] made in terms of  .  .  .  what benefits are we going to\ngive, what burdens are we going to put on people.”  (Transcript at 59.)\nThe decision of where and how to protect the government fisc and to\nprotect the bargains struck by previous Congresses does not independ-\nently constitute a rational basis upon which to differentiate among\nclasses of citizens.  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1014; see also Plyler, 457 U.S.\nat 227, 229 (holding that preservation of government resources cannot,\nas a matter of law, justify barring some arbitrarily chosen group from\na government program).  There must be some rational basis upon which\nto decide not to expend public resources for a particular group. \n\n50a\nwhose “sheer breadth” is “discontinuous with the rea-\nsons offered for it.”  Id. at 632, 635 (rejecting justifica-\ntions where “[t]he breadth of the [measure] is so far re-\nmoved from these particular justifications that we find\nit impossible to credit them”); see also Eisenstadt v.\nBaird, 405 U.S. 438, 449 (1972) (rejecting justification of\nlaw discriminating between married and unmarried indi-\nviduals in access to contraceptives as “so riddled with\nexceptions” that the interest claimed by the government\n“cannot reasonably be regarded as its aim”).  \nDOMA has no effect on who may become a parent\nunder federal or state law.  Moreover, whether a same-\nsex couple is entitled to marriage benefits has no ratio-\nnal relation to that couple’s or an opposite-sex couple’s\nability to procreate.  Significantly, to reiterate, the abil-\nity to procreate has never been a precondition to mar-\nriage in any jurisdiction.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605\n(Scalia, J. dissenting).9  Here, there is simply no connec-\ntion between the ability (or capacity) to become a parent\nand the designation of federal entitlements based on a\ndefinition of marriage that excludes legally married cou-\nples who are capable of becoming parents.\n9 During oral argument, counsel for BLAG argued that an additional\nreason for the passage of DOMA was the fact that opposite-sex married\ncouples could “have accidental pregnancies” or “can make babies spon-\ntaneously.”  (Transcript at 63-64.) BLAG did not, however, articulate\nhow the fact that opposite-sex couples can have accidental pregnancies\nconstitutes an interest supporting the passage of DOMA.  Although the\ngeneration of children may be biologically more spontaneous with\nopposite-sex couples, married or unmarried, the Court remains per-\nplexed how the uniformly deliberate decision of same-sex married\ncouples to become parents can be perceived as a justification against\nsupporting their procreation and child-rearing efforts. \n\n51a\nDenying federal benefits to same-sex married cou-\nples has no rational effect on the procreation and child-\nrearing practices of opposite-sex married (or unmarried)\ncouples.  See Perry II, 2012, WL 372713, at *21 (“There\nis no rational reason to think that taking away the desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples would ad-\nvance the goal of encouraging  .  .  .  opposite-sex couples\nto procreate more responsibly.”)  To the extent some\npeople may have a bias in favor of preferring biological\nparents over other couples, there is no such recognition\nof this distinction under federal or state law.  See id.\nThere has been no showing that DOMA alters any state\nor federal law governing childbearing, procreation or\nfamily structure.  Given the state of the law, the ratio-\nnale of promoting responsible child-rearing finds no\n“‘footing in the realities of the subject addressed by the\nlegislation,’ and thus cannot be credited as rational.”\nPerry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *20 (citing Heller, 509 U.S.\nat 321). \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Congress’ stated\njustification of encouraging responsible procreation and\nchild-rearing bears no rational relationship to the classi-\nfication which burdens same-sex married couples. \nb. Nurturing  the  institution  of  traditional,\nopposite-sex marriage. \nBLAG contends that the institution of opposite-sex\nmarriage is deeply rooted in American law, embedded in\nhistory and tradition, and has been defined both by\nBlack’s Law Dictionary and the Bible.  (BLAG Motion to\nDismiss at 23-24, citing Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S.\n783, 792 (1983) (holding that traditional marriage “is\ndeeply embedded in the history and tradition of this\ncountry” and “has become part of the fabric of our soci-\n\n52a\nety”) and Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 186 (Minn.\n1971) (holding that the “institution of marriage as a un-\nion of man and woman, uniquely involving the procre-\nation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as\nthe book of Genesis.”)). \nAgain, the argument that the definition of marriage\nshould remain the same for the definition’s sake is a cir-\ncular argument, not a rational justification.  Simply stat-\ning what has always been does not address the reasons\nfor it.  The mere fact that prior law, history, tradition,\nthe dictionary and the Bible have defined a term does\nnot give that definition a rational basis, it merely states\nwhat has been.  Tradition, standing alone, does not pro-\nvide a rational basis for the law.  Williams, 399 U.S. at\n239.  Simply, the “ancient lineage” of the law does not\nrender it rational.  See Heller, 509 U.S. at 327. \nBLAG argues, but does not explain how denying\nmarriage benefits only to same-sex couples will some-\nhow  make  marriage  between  opposite-sex  couples\nbetter.  The proffered justification may derive from\nstrongly-held religious or fundamentally traditional be-\nliefs, but still does not provide a legally recognizable\nrational basis for sustaining a law that actively discrimi-\nnates against legally married couples.  The exclusion of\nsame-sex couples from the federal definition of marriage\ndoes nothing to encourage or strengthen opposite-sex\nmarriages.  See Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *23 (hold-\ning that “the argument that withdrawing the designation\nof ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples could on its own\npromote the strength or stability of opposite-sex marital\nrelationships lacks any such footing in reality”); see also\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 972 (“Permitting same-sex\ncouples to marry will not affect the number of oppo-\n\n53a\nsite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have chil-\ndren outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability\nof opposite-sex marriages”); In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\n932 (this governmental interest “is largely irrelevant to\nthe rational basis analysis here because the same-sex\ncouples  who  seek  the  benefits  are  already  married.\nAlso, gays and lesbians will not be encouraged to enter\ninto marriages with members of the opposite sex by the\ngovernment’s denial of benefits to same-sex spouses,\nand the denial will not discourage same-sex couples from\nentering into same-sex marriages; so the denial cannot\nbe said to ‘nurture’ or ‘defend’ the institution of hetero-\nsexual marriage.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Congress’ stated\njustification of nurturing the institution of traditional,\nopposite-sex marriage bears no rational relationship to\nthe classification which burdens same-sex married cou-\nples. \n3. Application of Rational Basis Review to Alter-\nnative Justifications Proffered by BLAG. \nBLAG does not rely exclusively on the stated legisla-\ntive justifications advanced by Congress during its pas-\nsage of DOMA.  A court may “hypothesize the motiva-\ntions of the  .  .  .  legislature to find a legitimate objec-\ntive promoted by the provision under attack.”  Shaw, 887\nF.2d at 948-49 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).  “[I]t is entirely irrelevant for constitutional\npurposes whether the conceived reason for the chal-\nlenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.”\nBeach Communications, 508 U.S. at 313.  In this regard,\nBLAG has proffered several additional hypothetical ra-\ntional bases for passing DOMA. \n\n54a\na. Congressional caution in defining a legisla-\ntive term and maintaining the status quo. \nBLAG contends that Congress could have had a ra-\ntional basis for the passage of DOMA by preserving the\nstatus quo in the federal definition of marriage while\nwaiting for the states to “tinker with the substantive\ncenturies-old definition of marriage.”  (BLAG Opp. Br.\non Motion for Summary Judgment at 22.)  To the extent\nthis argument is premised upon preserving a traditional\ndefinition of marriage for its own sake, the Court has\nalready rejected this argument.  As the court found in\nGill, “[s]taying the course is not an end in and of itself,\nbut rather a means to an end.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at\n390-94.  The long history of discrimination against gay\nmen and lesbians does not provide a rational basis for\ncontinuing it. \nMoreover, DOMA does not preserve the status quo.\nThe passage of DOMA marks a stark departure from\ntradition and a blatant disregard of the well-accepted\nconcept of federalism in the area of domestic relations.\nSee Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392 (finding that DOMA\n“mark[ed] the first time the federal government has\never attempted to legislatively mandate a uniform fed-\neral definition of marriage—or any other core concept of\ndomestic relations, for that matter”); see also Drag-\novich,  764  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1189  (“[S]ection  three  of\nDOMA was a preemptive strike to bar federal legal rec-\nognition of same-sex marriages should certain states\ndecide to allow them, rather than a law that furthered\nthe status quo, which gave the states authority to define\nmarriage for themselves.”). \nThe status quo prior to the passage of DOMA was\nfederal recognition of the individual states’ authority to\n\n55a\ndefine marriage.  “The whole subject of the domestic\nrelations  .  .  .  belongs to the laws of the States and not\nto the laws of the United States.”  Elk Grove Unified\nSchool District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004) (cita-\ntion omitted); see also Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404\n(1975) (holding that “domestic relations” have “long\nbeen regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the\nStates” and “[t]he State  .  .  .  has absolute right” to reg-\nulate  marriage)  (citations  omitted);  Ankenbrandt  v.\nRichards, 504 U.S. 689, 703, 716 (1992) (“declarations of\nstatus, e.g., marriage, annulment, divorce, custody, and\npaternity,” lie at the “core” of domestic relations law\nreserved to the states) (Blackmun, J., concurring).  \nPrior to the enactment of DOMA, the federal govern-\nment had not attempted to craft its own federal defini-\ntion of marriage, “notwithstanding the occurrence of\nother similarly politically-charged, protracted, and fluid\ndebates at the state level as to who should be permitted\nto marry.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392.  Congress ac-\ncepted without revision the patchwork of different state\nmarriage definitions regarding, for example, age re-\nquirements or marriage among related persons.  (See\ne.g., Declaration of Nancy Cott (“Cott Decl.”) at ¶¶ 26,\n51-52, 56-57.)  The federal government has continued\nto  defer  to  the  states  during  unprecedented,  hotly-\ncontested shifts in state marriage law, especially in the\narea of interracial marriage.  (Id. at ¶¶ 57.)  The strong\ntradition of federalism mandated that the federal gov-\nernment refrain from inserting itself in the business of\ndomestic relations.10\n10 BLAG contends that Congress has previously enacted laws which\ncreate unique federal definitions of marriage, for instance in the area\nfederal tax regulations, Social Security, immigration or federal benefits.\n\n56a\nThe Court finds that the passage of DOMA, rather\nthan maintaining the status quo in the arena of domestic\nrelations, stands in stark contrast to it.  Accordingly, the\nCourt finds that Congressional caution in defining a leg-\nislative term and maintaining the status quo does not\nconstitute a rational basis. \nb. Congressional caution in area of social divi-\nsiveness. \nBLAG also contends that Congress should remain\ncautious, especially in an area of so much social divisive-\nness, by holding the purported federal definition of mar-\nriage steady while waiting to see how the states tinker\nwith new definitions.  The Court finds the contention\nsimilar to arguments that were advanced in support of\nantimiscegenation laws.  Proponents similarly argued\nthat the long-standing tradition of the separation of the\nHowever, in each instance, the federal government accepted the state\ndefinitions of marriage and merely superimposed further requirements\nfor falling within the federal entitlement statute.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.\n§ 416 (requiring marriage of at least one year to obtain certain Social\nSecurity benefits); 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(b)(1) (discrediting marriages en-\ntered into merely to obtain immigration status).  These federal require-\nments do not purport to redefine or create a federal definition of marr-\niage, but rather impose additional criteria to further particular legis-\nlative goals.  \nIn addition, BLAG cites examples in which Congress legislated in the\narea of domestic relations, such as when it banned polygamy in the\nUtah Territory, when it promoted and supported marriages of former\nslaves after the Civil War, and legislation in the context of treatment of\nIndians tribes.  However, in each of those unique historical instances,\nCongress was acting in the role of the state in the absence of a secure\nstate government.  (See, e.g., Cott Decl. at ¶¶ 75-79.)  DOMA marks a\nradical departure from the tradition of federalism in the area of domes-\ntic relations.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392. \n\n57a\nraces provided justification for prohibiting interracial\nmarriage.  The lower court in Loving found that God had\ncreated the races and placed them on separate conti-\nnents in order that there “would be no cause for such\n[interracial] marriages.”  388 U.S. at 3.  It was, at the\ntime, a strongly-held belief among proponents of anti-\nmiscegenation laws that mixing the races was against\nGod’s will, flaunted a long history of tradition and, at its\ncore, endangered the institution of marriage.  See id.\nHowever, in its holding in Loving, the Supreme Court\nfound that although interracial marriage was a socially\ndivisive issue and proponents of antimiscegenation held\ntraditional and religious beliefs about the erosion of the\ntraditional concept of marriage, Virginia’s racial classifi-\ncation violated the equal protection guarantee.  Id. at\n11-12. \nMore recently, in Romer, the Supreme Court ad-\ndressed a proposed amendment to the Colorado state\nconstitution that would prohibit all legislative, executive,\nor  judicial  action  designed  to  protect  discrimination\nagainst homosexuals.  One of the arguments in support\nof the state amendment was that it was an attempt to\nwithdraw “a deeply divisive social and political issue\nfrom elected representatives and place its resolution\nsquarely in the hands of the people.”  (See Brief for Peti-\ntioner  filed  April  21,  1995  in  Romer  v.  Evans,  No.\n94-1039 (Supreme Court), 1995 WL 17008429, at *10) \nProponents contended that it was important to ensure\nthat “the deeply divisive issue of homosexuality does not\nserve to seriously fragment Colorado’s body politic.”\n(See id., at *47)  Proponents argued that it required\nsome leeway in this socially divisive atmosphere to han-\ndle the “sensitive and core political choices” in matters\nregarding discrimination against homosexuals calmly\n\n58a\nover time.  (Id.)  The Supreme Court, however, flatly\nrejected this argument as providing a rational basis and\nfound that the proposed amendment to the Colorado\nstate constitution was unconstitutional.  Romer, 517 U.S.\nat 620. \nHere, too, this Court finds that Congress cannot, like\nan ostrich, merely bury its head in the sand and wait for\ndanger to pass, especially at the risk of permitting con-\ntinued constitutional injury upon legally married cou-\nples.  The fact that the issue is socially divisive does\nnothing to relieve the judiciary of its obligation to exam-\nine the constitutionality of the discriminating classifica-\ntions in the law. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Congressional cau-\ntion in the area of social divisiveness does not constitute\na rational basis. \nc. Consistency. \nBLAG also contends that Congress could have ratio-\nnally sought to base eligibility for federal benefits on a\ntraditional definition of marriage in order “to avoid the\narbitrariness and inconsistency in such eligibility  .  .  .\nand not depend[] on the vagaries of state law.”  (BLAG\nMotion to Dismiss at 24.)  However, as explained above,\nin all of the years preceding the passage of DOMA, Con-\ngress relied on the various states’ definitions of mar-\nriage without incident.  All couples married under state\nlaw were entitled to federal benefits, even if the particu-\nlars of the states’ definitions were variable.  The passage\nof DOMA actually undermined administrative consis-\ntency by requiring that the federal government, for the\nfirst time, discern which state definitions of marriage\nare entitled to federal recognition and which are not. \n\n59a\nAccordingly, the Court finds that consistency does\nnot constitute a rational basis. \nd. Any other possible basis. \nThe Court finds that neither Congress’ claimed legis-\nlative justifications nor any of the proposed reasons\nproffered by BLAG constitute bases rationally related\nto any of the alleged governmental interests.  Further,\nafter concluding that neither the law nor the record can\nsustain any of the interests suggested, the Court, having\ntried on its own, cannot conceive of any additional inter-\nests that DOMA might further.  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at\n1015. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court HEREBY DE-\nNIES BLAG’s motion to dismiss; DENIES as moot\nBLAG’s motion to strike; GRANTS Ms. Golinski’s mo-\ntion for summary judgment; and GRANTS the OPM’s\nmotion to dismiss. \nThe Court has found that DOMA unconstitutionally\ndiscriminates against same-sex married couples.  Even\nthough animus is clearly present in its legislative his-\ntory, the Court, having examined that history, the argu-\nments made in its support, and the effects of the law, is\npersuaded that something short of animus may have\nmotivated DOMA’s passage: \nPrejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not\nfrom malice or hostile animus alone.  It may result as\nwell  from  insensitivity  caused  by  simple  want  of\ncareful, rational reflection or from some instinctive\nmechanism to guard against people who appear to be\ndifferent in some respects from ourselves.  \n\n60a\nBoard of Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett,\n531 U.S. 356, 374-75 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \nThis case was presented by an employee of the judi-\ncial branch against the executive branch, which ulti-\nmately determined it could not legitimately support the\nlaw.    The  law  was  then  defended  by  the  legislative\nbranch.  The judicial branch is tasked with determining\nwhether this federal law is unconstitutional.  That is the\ncourts’ authority and responsibility.  “It is emphatically\nthe province and duty of the judicial department to say\nwhat the law is” and, where it is so, to declare legislation\nunconstitutional.  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 177 (1803).  As Supreme Court Chief Justice John\nG.  Roberts  said  during  his  confirmation  hearings:\n“Judges are like umpires.  Umpires don’t make the\nrules, they apply them.  .  .  .  it’s [the judge’s] job to call\nballs and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.”  Confirmation\nHearing on the Nomination of John G.

BLAG nevertheless opposes \nthis petition on three grounds:  (1) the federal petition-\ners might lack appellate standing to seek this Court’s \nreview; (2) certiorari before judgment is not warranted \nbecause the petitions for a writ of certiorari in Massa-\nchusetts v. Department of Health & Human Services, \n682 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2012), petitions for cert. pending, \n(1) \n\n2 \nNos. 12-13 (filed June 29, 2012) and 12-15 (filed July 3, \n2012), present the same question; and (3) granting this \npetition would unnecessarily complicate proceedings be-\nfore the Court.  None of those asserted grounds war-\nrants denial of the present petition.  And even BLAG \nhas now endorsed this petition as “the best of the re-\nmaining vehicles” after Massachusetts.  Nos. 12-63 and \n12-307 BLAG Supp. Br. 12. \nA.  Federal  Petitioners,  As  Defendants  Against  Which \nJudgment Was Entered, Have Standing To Seek Certio-\nrari \nAs explained more fully in the government’s reply \nbrief in No. 12-15 (at 2-6), this Court’s precedents make \nclear that petitioners, as a federal entity and official \ncharged with Section 3’s enforcement and against which \njudgment was entered below (No. 12-16 Pet. App. 62a), \nare proper parties to invoke this Court’s jurisdiction to \nreview the judgment in this case.  See INS v. Chadha, \n462 U.S. 919, 930-931 (1983) (“When an agency of the \nUnited States is a party to a case in which the Act of \nCongress it administers is held unconstitutional,” it may \nseek review of that decision, even though “the Executive \nmay agree with the holding that the statute in question \nis unconstitutional.”).  BLAG’s appellate-standing objec-\ntion thus lacks merit. \nBLAG’s  objection  not  only  is  foreclosed  by  this \nCourt’s decision in Chadha, but BLAG itself concedes \n(No. 12-16 Br. in Opp. 15, 20; No. 12-307 Supp. Br. 9) \nthat its objection may have even less force in the context \nof a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment.  In \nKinsella v. Krueger, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), for example, the \nCourt reviewed the district court’s denial of a writ of \nhabeas corpus based on a petition for a writ of certiorari \nbefore judgment filed by the government, the prevailing \n \n\n3 \nparty in the district court.  See id. at 5.  Although the \ndistrict court’s ruling was favorable, the government \nfiled the certiorari petition in order to supply an alterna-\ntive vehicle to Reid v. Covert, which was then pending on \nappeal, for addressing Congress’s power to authorize \nthe trial by court-martial of civilians accompanying the \nArmed Forces overseas.  Gov’t Pet. 5-7, Kinsella, supra \n(No. 713).  The government’s petition stated that it was \n“clear, of course, that the party prevailing in the district \ncourt may seek certiorari before judgment.”  Id. at 6 n.*.  \nThe Court granted the petition, consolidated the two \ncases, and decided them together.  While the Court did \nnot  expressly  address  whether  the  government  had \nproperly invoked this Court’s jurisdiction in Kinsella,  \n354 U.S. at 5, the government’s standing to do so is even \nclearer in this case.  Here, unlike in Kinsella, the gov-\nernment was not a prevailing party.  Rather, the district \ncourt below entered judgment against petitioners.  Ac-\ncordingly, the government’s standing to seek certiorari \nbefore judgment in this case should be beyond dispute.   \nB.  Certiorari Before Judgment Is Warranted Here If Nec-\nessary To Ensure Timely and Definitive Resolution Of \nThe Question Presented \nAll parties in this case agree that the question of \nDOMA Section 3’s constitutionality is one of exceptional \npublic importance warranting this Court’s expeditious \nreview.  And no party disputes that this case squarely \npresents the question.  BLAG nevertheless argues that \n“[t]here is no reason to take the extraordinary step of \ngranting certiorari before judgment here when the exact \nsame issue is presented in a pending petition for certio-\nrari after judgment” in Massachusetts.  No. 12-16 Br. in \nOpp. 1.  That argument fails to grapple with the princi-\npal justification for the government’s petition in this \n \n\n4 \ncase:  to ensure that this Court can timely and defini-\ntively resolve Section 3’s constitutionality.  No. 12-16 \nPet. 11.  For the reasons explained in the government’s \nsupplemental and reply briefs in United States v. Wind-\nsor, No. 12-307, in which the court of appeals has now \nissued its decision, the Court should grant review in that \ncase.  If, however, this Court were to determine that nei-\nther Windsor nor Massachusetts provides an appropri-\nate vehicle to do so, this case could. \nAlthough BLAG claims that the government could \nhave sought certiorari before judgment “years ago” (No. \n12-16 Br. in Opp. 15), the first court of appeals decision \nholding that Section 3 violated the Fifth Amendment’s \nguarantee of equal protection was issued on May 31, \n2012.  That recent development significantly changed \nthe landscape of DOMA litigation, which has continued \nto advance quickly and has produced similar holdings in \nevery court to have considered the issue since, including \nthe Second Circuit’s decision in Windsor.  In any event, \nBLAG agrees with the government that Section 3’s con-\nstitutionality now warrants this Court’s prompt resolu-\ntion and that, if necessary, this petition provides an ac-\nceptable vehicle for that resolution.  No. 12-307 BLAG \nSupp. Br. 12. \nC. Granting This Petition Would Not Unnecessarily Com-\nplicate Proceedings Before This Court  \nBLAG expresses concern that granting this petition \nwould “needlessly complicat[e]” this Court’s review on \nthe merits.  No. 12-16 Br. in Opp. 1.  The complication it \nrepeatedly refers to is the possible need for a briefing \nand argument order to realign the parties.  See id. at 1, \n19, 22-23.  The potential issuance of a modified briefing \nand argument schedule, however, involves a modest step \nreadily within the Court’s capability and prior practice.   \n \n\n5 \nIn  Chadha,  for  example,  in  which  the  Executive \nBranch  agency  (INS)  appealed  to  the  Court  and  in \nwhich the Court also granted certiorari petitions filed by \nboth the Senate and House of Representatives, the par-\nties filed briefs in the following order:  the Senate and \nHouse filed “top-side” briefs as appellee-petitioner on \nthe same day; the individual alien filed a “bottom-side” \nbrief as appellee-respondent 42 days later, and the INS \nalso filed a “bottom-side” brief shortly thereafter; and \nthe Senate and House of Representatives filed reply \nbriefs 30 days after the filing of the INS brief.  See also \nDepartment of Health & Human Servs. v. Florida, 132 \nS. Ct. 840 (2011) (No. 11-398) (ordering briefing sched-\nule on Anti-Injunction Act issue under which Court-\nappointed amicus curiae filed first; the Solicitor General \nand plaintiffs-respondents filed next simultaneously; the \nSolicitor General and plaintiffs-respondents then filed \nsimultaneous reply briefs; and Court-appointed amicus \nfiled its reply last).  Of course, unlike in Chadha and \nMassachusetts, BLAG has not filed its own petition for \ncertiorari in this case. \n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the reasons explained in the government’s sup-\nplemental brief (at 10-11) and reply brief in United \nStates v. Windsor, No. 12-307, the Court should grant \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari in that case.  Alt-\nhough Department of Health and Human Services v. \nMassachusetts, petitions for cert. pending, Nos. 12-13 \n(filed June 29, 2012), 12-15 (filed July 3, 2012), and 12-97 \n(filed July 20, 2012), is also a case in which a court of ap-\npeals has rendered a decision, Windsor now provides the \nmost appropriate vehicle for this Court’s resolution of \nthe constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA.  In particu-\nlar, the court of appeals in Massachusetts was con-\n \n\n6 \nstrained by binding circuit precedent as to the applica-\nble level of scrutiny, No. 12-15 Pet. App. 10a, whereas \nthe court of appeals in Windsor was not so constrained, \nand its analysis may be beneficial to this Court’s consid-\neration of that issue.   \nIn the event the Court grants review in Windsor, it \nshould hold the petitions in Massachusetts pending final \nresolution on the merits.  In the event the Court decides \nthat neither case in which the court of appeals has is-\nsued  a  decision  provides  an  appropriate  vehicle,  it \nshould grant the government’s petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari before judgment in either Office of Personnel \nManagement v. Golinski, No. 12-16 (filed July 3, 2012), \nor Office of Personnel Management v. Pedersen, No. 12-\n302 (filed Sept. 11, 2012). \nRespectfully submitted.  \n \n    DONALD B.

It treats same-sex couples who are legally married under their states' laws \n4  differently than similarly situated opposite-sex couples, denying them the status, recognition, and \n5  significant federal benefits otherwise available to married persons.  Under well-established \n6  factors set forth by the Supreme Court, discrimination based on sexual orientation is subject to \n7  heightened scrutiny.  Under that standard of review, Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional. \n8  The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the appropriate level of scrutiny for classifications \n9  based on sexual orientation, but it has established and repeatedly confirmed a set of factors that \n10  guides the determination whether heightened scrutiny applies: (1) whether the group in question \n11  has suffered a history of discrimination; (2) whether members of the group \"exhibit obvious, \n12  irmnutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a group\"; (3) whether the group \n13  is a minority or is politically powerless; and (4 ) whether the characteristics distinguishing the \n14  group have little relation to legitimate policy objectives or to an individual's \"ability to perform \n15  or contribute to society.\" Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602-03 (1987); City of Cleburne v. \n16  Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432,439 (1985).  Careful consideration of those factors \n17  demonstrates that sexual orientation classifications should be subject to heightened scrutiny. \n18  Although binding authority of this circuit holds that rational basis review applies to \n19  sexual orientation classifications, see, e.g., High Tech Gays v.  Defense Industrial Security \n20  Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 570 (9th Cir. 1990), we respectfully submit that this decision no \n21  longer withstands scrutiny.  To the extent High Tech Gays rested on inferences drawn from the \n22  Supreme Court's decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), that rationale does not \n23  survive the Supreme Court's subsequent overruling of Bowers in Lawrence v.  Texas, 539 U.S. \n24  558 (2003).  To the extent High Tech Gays considered the factors the Supreme Court has \n25  identified as relevant to the inquiry, we respectfully submit that its consideration was incomplete \n26  and ultimately incorrect. \n27  Heightened scrutiny should be applied, and Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional under \n28  that level ofreview. \nDefendants' Briefi n Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n3:10cv257-JSW  -VI-\n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page8 of 31\nI  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \n2  Plaintiff Karen Golinski, a staff attorney with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n3  Circuit, is enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (\"FEHBP\").  2d Am. Compl. \n4  ~~ 18-I 9.1  Since August 2008, Plaintiff has been married under the laws of California to a \n5  spouse who, like Plaintiff, is a woman.  !d. ~ I 7.  After becoming married, Plaintiff sought to \n6  have her wife enrolled as an additional beneficiary under her FEHBP plan. !d. ~ 22.  Plaintiffs \n7  efforts to have her wife enrolled as an additional beneficiary were ultimately unsuccessful, as the \n8  FEHBA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 8901-8914, when read in light of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, \n9  1 U.S.C. § 7 (\"DOMA\"), prohibits the extension ofFEHBP coverage to same-sex spouses.  In \nI 0  pertinent part, DOMA provides: \nII  In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or \ninterpretation oft he various administrative bureaus and agencies oft he United States, \nI 2  the word \"marriage\" means only a legal union between one man and one woman as \nhusband and wife, and the word \"spouse\" refers only to a person of the opposite sex \nI 3  who is a husband or wife. \n14  I U.S.C. § 7. \n15  After the completion of an administrative hearing process under the Ninth Circuit's \n16  Employee Dispute Resolution (\"EDR\") Plan, Plaintiff brought the instant action on January 20, \nI 7  20 I 0.'  Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint was dismissed by this Court on March 16, 20 II. \n18  ECF No. 98.  On April 14,201 I, Plaintiff filed her Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 102, \n19 \n20 \n1  The FEHBP was established pursuant to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act, 5 U.S.C. \n21  §§ 890 I et seq. (\"FEHBA\"), which created the FEHBP as a comprehensive health insurance \nprogram for federal civilian employees, their family members, and others.  FEHBA confers broad \n22  authority on the United States Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\") to administer the \nprogram and to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the statute's objectives, including \n23 \nregulations prescribing \"the manner and conditions under which an employee is eligible to \n24  enroll.\" 5 U.S.C. § 8913.  FEHBA grants OPM authority to contract with \"qualified carriers\" \noffering health insurance plans.  5 U.S.C. §§ 8902, 8903, 8906.  The \"employees\" who may \n25  participate in the FEHBP include employees of the Judiciary.  5 U.S.C. §§  2105(a)(2), \n890I(I)(A). \n26 \n27  2  A more detailed recitation of the factual and procedural history ofthis case is set forth in this \nCourt's Order Granting Motion to Dismiss and Denying Motion for Preliminary Injunction of \n28  March 16,2011, at 2-5 and passim.  ECF No. 98. \nDefendants' Briefi n Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n3: !Ocv257-JSW  I \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page9 of 31\nI  which now asserts that DOMA is unconstitutional as applied to her.  It is to that constitutional \n2  argument that this brief is addressed.  Plaintiff also appears to assert that the Defendants \n3  incorrectly or unreasonably read FEHBA to deny Plaintiffs request for the enrollment of her \n4  wife as an additional beneficiary under the plan.  As set forth in the memorandum in support of \n5  Defendants' motion to dismiss, ECF No. I I8-I, such claim should be dismissed to the extent it is \n6  adequately asserted in the first instance. \n7  Plaintiffs wife remains uncovered by Plaintiff's FEHBP plan. \n8 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n9 \nTo withstand a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint \"must \nIO \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to reliefthat is plausible on its \nI I \nface.\"' Ashcroft v. Iqbal,- U.S.-, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic v. \nI2 \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  Under Iqbal and Twombly, \"[a] claim has facial \n13 \nplausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference \nI4 \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" !d. \nIS \nARGUMENT \nI6 \nI.  DOMA VIOLATES EQUAL PROTECTION. \nI7 \nThe Constitution's guarantee of equal protection ofthe laws, applicable to the federal \nI8 \ngovernment through the Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment, see Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 \nI9 \nU.S. 497, 500 (1954), embodies a fundamental requirement that \"all persons similarly situated \n20 \nshould be treated alike.\"  City ofC  leburne v.  Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432,439 (1985). \n2I \nDOMA Section 3 is inconsistent with that principle of equality, as it denies legally married same \n22 \nsex couples federal benefits that are available to similarly situated opposite-sex couples. \n23 \nFor the reasons set forth below, heightened scrutiny, rather than rational basis review, is \n24 \nthe appropriate standard of review for classifications based on sexual orientation.  Under that \n25 \nmore rigorous standard, Section 3 of DOMA cannot withstand constitutional muster. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n3:10cv257-JSW  2 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page10 of 31\n1  A.  PLAINTIFFS' EQUAL PROTECTION CHALLENGE TO DOMA IS \nSUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY UNDER SUPREME COURT \n2  PRECEDENT. \n3  As a general rule, legislation challenged under equal protection principles is presumed \n4  valid and sustained as long as the \"classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a \n5  legitimate state interest.\"  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.  \"[W]here individuals in the group affected \n6  by a law have distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the [government] has authority \n7  to implement,\" courts will not \"closely scrutinize legislative choices as to whether, how, and to \n8  what extent those interests should be pursued.\" !d. at 441.  Where, however, legislation classifies \n9  on the basis of a factor that \"generally provides no sensible ground for differential treatment,\" \nI 0  such as race or gender, the law demands more searching review and imposes a greater burden on \n11  the government to justifY the classification. !d. at 440-41. \n12  Such suspect or quasi -suspect classifications are reviewed under a standard of heightened \n13  scrutiny, under which the government must show, at a minimum, that a law is \"substantially \n14  related to an important government objective.\"  Clarkv. Jeter, 586 U.S. 456,461 (1988).  This \n15  more searching review enables courts to ascertain whether the government has employed the \n16  classification for a significant and proper purpose, and serves to prevent implementation of \n17  classifications that are the product of impe1missible prejudice or stereotypes.  See, e.g., \n18  Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion); United States v. \n19  Virginia (\"VMI\"), 518 U.S. 515, 533 {1996). \n20  The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the appropriate level of scrutiny for classifications \n21  based on sexual orientation. 3  It has, however, established and repeatedly confirmed a set of \n22 \n23 \n3  In neither Romer v.  Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), nor Lawrence v.  Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), \n24  did the Supreme Court opine on the applicability of heightened scrutiny to sexual orientation.  In \nboth cases, the Court invalidated sexual orientation classifications under a more permissive \n25  standard of review without having to decide whether heightened scrutiny applied (Romer found \nthat the legislation failed rational basis review, 517 U.S. at 634-35; Lawrence found the law \n26 \ninvalid under the Due Process Clause, 539 U.S. at 574-75). \n27  Nor did the Court decide the question in its one-line per curiam order in Baker v. Nelson, \n409 U.S. 810 (1972), in which it dismissed an appeal as of right from a state supreme court \n28  decision denying marriage status to a same-sex couple, id. at 810.  Baker did not concern the \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n3: 10cv257-JSW  3 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page11 of 31\n1  factors that guide the determination of whether heightened scmtiny applies to a classification that \n2  singles out a particular group.  These include: (1) whether the group in question has suffered a \n3  history of discrimination; (2) whether members of the group \"exhibit obvious, immutable, or \n4  distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group\"; (3) whether the group is a \n5  minority or is politically powerless; and (4) whether the characteristics distinguishing the group \n6  have little relation to legitimate policy objectives or to an individual's \"ability to perform or \n7  contribute to society.\" See Bowen v.  Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587,602-03 (1987); Cleburne, 473 U.S. \n8  at 441-42. \n9  Although there is substantial circuit court authority, including binding authority of this \nI 0  circuit, holding that rational basis review generally applies to sexual orientation classifications, \n11  see, e.g., High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 570 (9th Cir. \n12  1990), most of these decisions fail to give adequate consideration to these enumerated factors. \n13  Indeed, the reasoning of this line of case law traces back to circuit court decisions from the late \n14  1980s and early 1990s, a time when Bowers v.  Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), was still the law. \n15  The Supreme Court subsequently overmled Bowers in Lawrence v.  Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), \n16  and the reasoning of these circuit decisions no longer withstands scrutiny. \n17  In High Tech Gays, for example, the Ninth Circuit considered a constitutional challenge \n18  to the Department of Defense's practice of conducting mandatory investigations of security \n19  clearance applicants known or suspected to be gay.  Without expressly relying on the deference \n20  due to military judgments, cf Rostker v.  Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 70 (1981), the court concluded \n21 \n22 \n23 \nconstitutionality of a federal law, like DOMA Section 3, that distinguishes among couples who \nare already legally manied in their own states, and was motivated by animus toward gay and \n24 \nlesbian people.  See Part I.B, infra.  Moreover, neither the Minnesota Supreme Court decision, \n25  Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 187 (Minn. 1971), nor the questions presented in the \nplaintiffs' jurisdictional statement raised whether classifications based on sexual orientation are \n26 \nsubject to heightened scrutiny, see Baker v. Nelson, Jurisdictional Statement, No. 71-1027 (Sup. \nCt.), at 2; see also id. at 13 (repeatedly describing equal protection challenge as based on the \n27 \n\"arbitrary\" nature of the state law).  There is no indication in the Court's order that the Court \n28  nevertheless considered, much less resolved, that question. \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n3: /Ocv257-JSW  4 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page12 of 31\nI  that the challenged classification was subject only to rational basis review.4  To the extent that \n2  conclusion rested on inferences drawn from the Supreme Court's decision in Bowers, see High \n3  Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 574, that rationale does not survive the overruling of Bowers in \n4  Lawrence.  And to the extent High Tech Gays considered the factors the Supreme Court has \n5  identified as relevant to the inquiry, see High Tech Gays, 895, F.2d at 573-74, we respectfully \n6  submit that its consideration was incomplete and ultimately incorrect for the reasons explained \n7  below.5  Careful consideration of those factors demonstrates that classifications based on sexual \n8  orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny. \n9 \n10 \nII \n12 \n4  High Tech Gays and a number of cases in other circuits involved challenges to military policy \n13 \non homosexual conduct.  See, e.g., High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 565; see also Cook v.  Gates, 528 \n14  F.Jd 42, 45 (1st Cir. 2008); Richenberg v. Perry, 97 FJd 256, 258 (8th Cir. 1996); Thomasson v. \nPerry, 80 FJd 915, 919 (4th Cir. 1996);  Steffan v. Perry, 4! F.3d 677,682 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (en \n15  bane); Woodard v.  United States, 871 F.2d I 068, 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1989); Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, \n881 F.2d 454,456 (7th Cir. 1989).  Classifications in the military context, however, present \n16 \ndifferent questions from classifications in the civilian context, see, e.g., Rostker v.  Goldberg, 453 \n17  U.S. 57,66 (1981), and the military is not involved here. \n18  5  As noted above, other courts of appeals have held that classifications on the basis of sexual \norientation are not subject to heightened scrutiny, but the reasoning of these courts is similarly \n19 \nflawed.  Many of those courts relied in part or in whole on Bowers.  See Equality Found. v.  City \n20  of Cincinnati, 54 FJd 261, 266-67 & n. 2 (6th Cir. 1995); Steffan, 41 F.3d at 685; Woodward, \n871 F.2d at 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1989); Ben-Shalom, 881 F.2d at 464; see also Richenberg v. Perry, \n21  97 FJd at 260 (citing to reasoning of prior appellate decision that were based on Bowers); \nThomasson, 80 F.3d at 928 (same).  Other courts relied on the fact that the Supreme Court has \n22 \nnot recognized that gays and lesbians constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class.  Cook, 528 FJd \n23  at 61; Johnson v. Johnson, 358 F.3d 503,532 (5'h Cir. 2004).  Though it is true that the Supreme \nCourt thus far has not yet recognized that gays and lesbians constitute a suspect class, see Note 3, \n24  supra, the Supreme Court does not decide a question by failing to opine on it in dicta \nunnecessary to the resolution of a case.  Finally, the remaining courts to address the issue offered \n25 \nno pertinent reasoning in so doing.  Lofton v. Sec 'y of the Dep 't ofC  hildren & Family Servs., 358 \n26  FJd 804, 818 (11th Cir. 2004); Nat 'I Gay Task Force v.

Gays and Lesbians Are a Quasi-Suspect or Suspect \nClass under the Relevant Factors Identified by the \n2  Supreme Court. \n3  i.  Gays and Lesbians Have Been Subject to \na History of Discrimination. \n4 \nFirst, as the Ninth Circuit has previously recognized, gay and lesbian individuals have \n5 \nsuffered a long and significant history of purposeful discrimination.  See High Tech Gays, 895 \n6 \nF.2d at 574 (\"[W]e do agree that homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination ....\" ); \n7 \nsee also Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, 881 F.2d 454,465-66 (7th Cir. 1989) (noting that \n8 \n\"[h] omosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination and still do, though possibly now in \n9 \nless degree\").  So far as we are aware, no court to consider this question has ever ruled otherwise. \n10 \nDiscrimination against gay and lesbian individuals has a long history in this country, \nII \nBowers, 478 U.S. at 192, from colonial laws ordering the death of\"any man [that] shall lie with \n12 \nmankind, as he lieth with womankind\" to state laws that, until very recently, have \"demean[ed] \n13 \nthe[] existence\" of gay and lesbian people \"by making their private sexual conduct a crime,\" \n14 \nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 578.  In addition to the discrimination reflected in DOMA itself, as \n15 \nexplained below, the federal government, state and local governments, and private parties all \n16 \nhave contributed to this long history of discrimination.\" \n17 \nDiscrimination by the Federal Government \n18 \nThe federal government has played a significant and regrettable role in the history of \n19 \ndiscrimination against gay and lesbian individuals. \n20 \nFor years, the federal government deemed gays and lesbians unfit for employment, \n21 \n22 \n6  We do not understand the Supreme Court to have called into question this well-documented \n23  history when it said in Lawrence that \"it was not until the 1970's that any State singled out \nsame-sex relations for criminal prosecution,\" 539 U.S. at 570, and that only nine States had done \n24  so by the time of Lawrence.  The question before the Court in Lawrence was whether, as Bowers \nhad asserted, same-sex sodomy prohibitions were so deeply rooted in history that they could not \n25 \nbe understood to contravene the Due Process Clause.  That the Court rejected that argument and \n26  invalidated Texas's sodomy law on due process grounds casts no doubt on the duration and scope \nof discrimination against gay and lesbian people writ large. \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: /Ocv257-JSW  6 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page14 of 31\nI  barring them from federal jobs on the basis of their sexual orientation.  See Employment of \n2  Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government, Interim Report submitted to the Committee \n3  by its Subcommittee on Investigations pursuant to S. Res. 280 (8lst Congress), December 15, \n4  1950 (\"Interim Report\"), at 9.  In 1950, Senate Resolution 280 directed a Senate subcommittee \n5  \"to make an investigation in the employment by the Government of homosexuals and other \n6  sexual perverts.\"  Patricia Cain, Litigating for Lesbian and Gay Rights: A Legal History, 79 Va. \n7  L. Rev. 1551, 1565-66 (1993).  The Committee found that from 1947 to 1950, \"approximately \n8  I, 700 applicants for federal positions were denied employment because they had a record of \n9  homosexuality or other sex perversion.\"  Interim Report at 9. \nI 0  In April 1953, in the wake of the Senate investigation, President Eisenhower issued \nII  Executive Order 10450, which officially added \"sexual perversion\" as a ground for investigation \n12  and possible dismissal from federal service.  Exec. Order No. I 0450, 3 C.P.R. 936, 938 (1953); \n13  see also 81 Fed. Reg. 2489.  The Order expanded the investigations of civilian employees for \n14  \"sexual perversion\" to include every agency and department of the federal government, and thus \n15  had the effect of requiring the termination of all gay people from federal employment. See \n16  General Accounting Office, Security Clearances: Consideration ofS exual Orientation in the \n17  Clearance Process, at 2 (Mar. 1995). \n18  The federal government enforced Executive Order 10450 zealously, engaging various \n19  agencies in intrusive investigatory techniques to purge gays and lesbians from the federal civilian \n20  workforce.  The State Department, for example, charged \"'skilled' investigators\" with \n21  \"interrogating every potential male applicant to discover if they had any effeminate tendencies or \n22  mannerisms,\" used polygraphs on individuals accused of homosexuality who denied it, and sent \n23  inspectors \"to every embassy, consulate, and mission\" to uncover homosexuality.

The United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"), for its part, aided the FBI by \n7  establishing \"a watch list on the recipients of physique magazines, subscrib[ing] to pen pal clubs, \n8  and initiat[ing] correspondence with men whom [it] believed might be homosexual.\"  I d.  The \n9  mail of individuals concluded to be homosexual would then be traced \"in order to locate other \nI 0  homosexuals.\"  I d.  The end result was thousands of men and women forced from their federal \nII  jobs based on the suspicion that they were gay or lesbian.  It was not until 1975 that the Civil \n12  Service Commission prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in federal \n13  civilian hiring.  See General Accounting Office, Security Clearances: Consideration ofS exual \n14  Orientation in the Clearance Process (1995) (describing the federal goverrunent's restrictions on \n15  the employment of gay and lesbian individuals).\" \n16  The history of the federal government's discrimination against gays and lesbians extends \n17  beyond the employment context.  For decades, gay and lesbian noncitizens were categorically \n18  barred from entering the United States, on grounds that they were \"persons of constitutional \n19  psychopathic inferiority,\" \"mentally defective,\" or sexually deviant.

INS, 387 U.S. 118 (1967), \"[t]he \n22  legislative history of [the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952] indicates beyond a shadow \n23  of a doubt that the Congress intended the phrase 'psychopathic personality' to include \n24 \n7  Open military service by gays and lesbians was prohibited, first by regulation and then by \n25 \nstatute, I 0 U.S. C. § 654 (2007), until the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" Repeal Act, enacted last year, \n26  111 P.L. 321, 124 Stat. 3515 (2010), and remains so pending completion of the repeal process \nmandated by the Act. \n27 \nDefendants' Briefi n Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3:/0cv257-JSW  8 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page16 of 31\nI  homosexuals.\"  !d. at 120.  This exclusion remained in effect until Congress repealed it in 1990. \n2  See Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978 (1990). \n3  Discrimination by State and Local Governments \n4  Like the federal government, state and local governments have long discriminated against \n5  gays and lesbians in public employment.  By the 1950s, many state and local governments had \n6  banned gay and lesbian employees, as well as gay and lesbian \"employees of state funded schools \n7  and colleges, and private individuals in professions requiring state licenses.\"  Williams Report, \n8  ch. 5 at 18.  Many states and localities began aggressive campaigns to purge gay and lesbian \n9  employees from government services as early as the 1940s. !d. at 18-34. \nI 0  This employment discrimination was interrelated with longstanding state law prohibitions \nII  on sodomy; the discrimination was frequently justified by the assumption that gays and lesbians \n12  had engaged in criminalized and immoral sexual conduct.  See, e.g., Childers v. Dallas Police \n13  Dep't, 513 F. Supp. 134,138 (N.D. Tex. 1981) (holding that police could refuse to hire gays), \n14  aff'd without opinion, 669 F.2d 732 (5th Cir. 1982); Gaylord v.  Tacoma Sch. Dist.

Rptr. 916,919 (1973) (holding that state sodomy statute was a valid ground \n21  for discrimination against gays as teachers); see also Baker v.  Wade, 553 F. Supp. 1121, 1128 n.9 \n22  (N.D. Tex. 1982) (\"A school board member testified that [the defendant] would have been fired \n23  [from his teaching position] ifthere had even been a suspicion that he had violated [the Texas \n24  sodomy statute].\") rev 'd,  769 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. 1985) (holding that challenged Texas \n25  homosexual sodomy law was constitutional).  Some of these discriminatory employment policies \n26  continued into the 1990s.  See Shahar v. Bowers, 114 F.3d I 097, 1105 & n.17, 1107-10 (lith \n27 \nDefendants' Briefi n Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28 \n3: !Ocv257-JSW  9 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page17 of 31\nI  Cir. 1997) (en bane) (upholding Georgia Attorney General's Office's rescission of a job offer to \n2  plaintiff after she mentioned to co-workers her upcoming wedding to her same-sex partner); City \n3  ofD  allas v.  England, 846 S. W.2d 957 (Tex. App. 1993) (holding unconstitutional Dallas Police \n4  Department policy denying gays and lesbians employment). \n5  Based on similar assumptions regarding the criminal sexual conduct of gays and lesbians, \n6  states and localities also denied child custody and visitation rights to gay and lesbian parents. \n7  See, e.g., Ex parte HH, 830 So. 2d 21,26 (Ala. 2002) (Moore, C.J., concurring) (concurring in \n8  denial of custody to lesbian mother on ground that \"homosexual conduct is ... abhorrent, \n9  immoral, detestable, a crime against nature, and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature's \nIO  God [and] an inherent evil against which children must be protected.\"); Pulliam v.

I995) (noting that, although the Court had \n17  previously held \"that a lesbian mother is not per se an unfit parent,\" the\"[c  ]onduct inherent in \nI 8  lesbianism is punishable as a Class 6 felony in the Commonwealth\" and therefore \"that conduct \nI 9  is another important consideration in determining custody\"); Roe v.

I985) (holding that father, who was in a gay relationship, was \"an unfit and improper \n21  custodian as a matter of law\" because ofhis \"continuous exposure of the child to his immoral \n22  and illicit relationship\"). \n23  State and local law also has been used to prevent gay and lesbian people from associating \n24  freely.  Liquor licensing laws, both on their face and through discriminatory enforcement, were \n25  long used to harass and shut down establishments patronized by gays and lesbians.  See William \n26 .  N.

Similar \n13  practices persist to this day.  See, e.g., Calhoun v. Pennington, No. 09-3286 (N.D. Ga.) \n14  (involving September 2009 raid on Atlanta gay bar and police harassment of patrons); Settlement \n15  in Gay Bar Raid, N.Y. Times (Mar. 23, 2011) (involving injuries sustained by gay bar patron \n16  during raid by Fort Worth police officers and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission). \n17  Efforts to combat discrimination against gays and lesbians also have led to significant \n18  political backlash, as evidenced by the long history of successful state and local initiatives \n19  repealing laws that protected gays and lesbians from discrimination.  See also Part LA. I .iii., \n20  infra.  A rash of such initiatives succeeded in the late 1970s.  See, e.g., Christopher R. Leslie, The \n21  Evolution ofA  cademic Discourse on Sexual Orientation and the Law, 84 Chi. Kent L. Rev. 345, \n22  359 (2009) (Boulder, Colorado in 1974); Rebecca Mae Salokar, Note, Gay and Lesbian \n23  Parenting in Florida: Family Creation Around the Law, 4 Fla. Int'l. U. L.

The laws at issue in Romer and in Equality Foundation v. City ofC  incinnati, \n3  54 F.3d 261 (6th Cir. 1995), are just two of a number of more recent examples from the 1990s. \n4  In fact, in May 2011, the Tennessee legislature enacted a law stripping counties and \n5  municipalities of their ability to pass local non-discrimination ordinances that would prohibit \n6  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and repealing the ordinances that had recently \n7  been passed by Nashville and other localities.8  Similar responses have followed states' decisions \n8  to recognize same-sex marriages.  See irifra at 15. \n9  Discrimination by Private Parties \n10  Finally, private discrimination against gays and lesbians in employment and other areas \nII  has been pervasive and continues to this day.'  See, e.g., Williams Report, ch. 5 at 8-9 \n12  (explaining that private companies and organizations independently adopted discriminatory \n13  employment policies modeled after the federal government's, and as \"federal employers shared \n14  police and military records on gay and lesbian individuals with private employers, these same \n15  persons who were barred from federal employment on the basis of their sexual orientation were \n16  simultaneously blacklisted from employment by many private companies\").  The pervasiveness \n17  of private animus against gays and lesbians is underscored by statistics showing that gays and \n18  lesbians continue to be among the most frequent victims of all reported hate crimes.  See H.R. \n19  Rep. 111-86, at 10 (2009) (\"According to 2007 FBI statistics, hate crimes based on the victim's \n20  sexual orientation-gay, lesbian, or bisexual--constituted the third highest category \n21 \n22 \n8  See State of Tennessee, Public Chapter No. 278, available at \n23  http:// state.tn.us/sos/acts/1 07 /pub/pc0278 .pdf. \n24  9  Private discrimination, as well as official discrimination, is relevant to whether a group has \nsuffered a history of discrimination for purposes of the heightened scrutiny inquiry.  Frontiero v. \n25 \nRichardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality) (\"[W]omen still face pervasive, although at \n26  times more subtle, discrimination in our educational institutions, in the job market and, perhaps \nmost conspicuously, in the political arena.\"). \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: 10cv257-JSW  12 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page20 of 31\nI  reported-1,265 incidents, or one-sixth of all reported hate crimes.\"); Kendall Thomas, Beyond \n2  the Privacy Principle, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 1431, 1464 (1992). \n3  In sum, gays and lesbians have suffered a long history of discrimination based on \n4  prejudice and stereotypes.  That history counsels strongly in favor of heightened scrutiny, giving \n5  courts ample reason to question whether sexual orientation classifications are the product of \n6  hostility rather than a legitimate government purpose. \n7  ii.  Gays and Lesbians Exhibit Immutable \nCharacteristics that Distinguish Them as \n8  a Group. \n9  Over ten years ago, in considering whether gays and lesbians constituted a \"particular \n10  social group\" for asylum purposes, the Ninth Circuit recognized that \"[s]exual orientation and \nII  sexual identity are immutable,\" and that \"[h]omosexuality is as deeply ingrained as \n12  heterosexuality.\"  Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, 225 F.3d I 084, I 093 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal \n13  quotation marks omitted).  But see High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 573 (stating that sexual \n14  orientation is not immutable because \"it is behavioral\").  Sexual orientation, the Ninth Circuit \n15  explained, is \"fundamental to one's identity,\" and gay and lesbian individuals \"should not be \n16  required to abandon\" it to gain access to fundamental rights guaranteed to all people. \n17  Hernandez-Montiel, 225 F.3d at 1093. \n18  That conclusion is consistent with tbe overwhelming consensus in the scientific \n19  community that sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic.  See e.g., G.M. Herek, eta!. \n20  Demographic, Psychological, and Social Characteristics ofS elf-Identified Lesbian, Gay, and \n21  Bisexual Adults, 7, 176-200 (2010), available at \n22  http://www.springerlink.com/content//fulltext.pdf (noting that in a national survey conducted \n23  with a representative sample of more than 650 self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults, 95 \n24  percent of the gay men and 83 percent of lesbian women reported that they experienced \"no \n25  choice at all\" or \"very little choice\" about their sexual orientation).  There is also a consensus \n26  among the established medical community that efforts to change an individual's sexual \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: /Ocv257-JSW  13 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page21 of 31\n1  orientation are generally futile and potentially dangerous to an individual's well-being.10  See \n2  Am. Psychological Ass'n, Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on \n3  Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation, at v (2009), available at \n4  http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf (\"[E]fforts to change \n5  sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm.\"); see also \n6  Richard A. Posner, Sex and Reason 101 n.35 (1992) (describing \"failure of treatment strategies \n7  ... to alter homosexual orientation\"); Douglas Haldeman, The Practice and Ethics ofS exual \n8  Orientation Conversion Therapy, 62 J. Consulting & Clinical Psycho!. 221, 226 (1994) \n9  (describing \"lack of empirical support for conversion therapy\"). \nI 0  Furthermore, sexual orientation need not be a \"visible badge\" that distinguishes gays and \n11  lesbians as a discrete group for the classification to warrant heightened scrutiny.  As the Supreme \n12  Court has made clear, a classification may be \"constitutionally suspect\" even if it rests on a \n13  characteristic that is not readily visible, such as illegitimacy.  Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, \n14  504 (1976); see id at 506 (noting that \"illegitimacy does not carry an obvious badge, as race or \n15  sex do,\" but nonetheless applying heightened scrutiny).  Whether or not gays and lesbians could \n16  hide their identities in order to avoid discrimination, they are not required to do so.  As the Court \n17  has recognized, sexual orientation is a core aspect of identity, and its expression is an \"integral \n18  part of human freedom,\" Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 562, 576-77. \n19  iii.  Gays and Lesbians Are Minorities with \nLimited Political Power. \n20 \nThird, gays and lesbians are a minority group,'' Able v.  United States, 968 F. Supp. 850, \n21 \n22 \n10  In fact, every major mental health organization has adopted a policy statement cautioning \n23  against the use of so-called \"conversion\" or \"reparative\" therapies to change the sexual \norientation of gays and lesbians.  These policy statements are reproduced in a 2009 publication of \n24 \nthe American Psychological Association, available at \nhttp://www .apa. org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts. pdf. \n25 \n26  11  It is difficult to offer a definitive estimate for the size of the gay and lesbian community in the \nUnited States.  According to an analysis of various data sources published in April 20 II by the \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3:10cv257-JSW  14 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page22 of 31\n1  863 (E.D.N.Y. 1997), rev 'd, !55 F.3d 628 (2d Cir. 1998), that has historically lacked political \n2  power.  To be sure, many ofthe forms of historical discrimination described above have subsided \n3  or been repealed.  But efforts to combat discrimination have frequently led to successful \n4  initiatives to scale back protections afforded to gay and lesbian individuals.  See also Part \n5  I.A.l.i., supra.  As described above, the adoption of ballot initiatives specifically repealing laws \n6  protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination (including the laws at issue in Romer and \n7  Equality Foundation v. City a/Cincinnati) are examples of such responses.  In fact, \"[f]rom 1974 \n8  to 1993, at least 21 referendums were held on the sole question of whether an existing law or \n9  executive order prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination should be repealed or retained.  In \n10  15 of these 21 cases, a majority voted to repeal the law or executive order.\"  Robert Wintemute, \nII  Sexual Orientation and Human Rights 56 (1995). \n12  The strong backlash in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to these civil rights ordinances has \n13  been followed in the 2000s with similar political backlashes against same-sex marriage.  In 1996, \n14  at the time DOMA was enacted, only three states had statutes restricting marriage to opposite-sex \n15  couples.  National Conference of State Legislatures, Same-Sex Marriage,  Civil Unions and \n16  Domestic Partnerships, available at http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=l6430 (last updated \n17  May 2011). Today, thirty-seven states have such statutes, and thirty states have constitutional \n18  amendments explicitly restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples.  Id. \n19  California and Iowa are recent examples of such backlash.  In May 2008, the California \n20  Supreme Court held that the state was constitutionally required to recognize same-sex marriage. \n21  In reMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384,419 (Cal. 2008).  In November 2008, California's voters \n22 \n23  Williams Institute, there appear to be 8 million adults in the United States who are lesbian, gay or \nbisexual, comprising 3.5 percent of the adult population.  See Gary J. Gates, How Many People \n24  Are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender? available at \nhttp://www3.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/pdf/How-many-people-are-LGBT-Final.pdf (last \n25 \nreviewed June 30, 2011).  Ascertaining the precise percentage of gays and lesbians in the \n26  population, however, is not relevant to the analysis, as it is clear that whatever the data reveal, \nthere is no dispute that gays and lesbians constitute a minority in the country. \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: !Ocv257-JSW  15 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page23 of 31\npassed Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to restrict marriage to opposite-sex \n2  couples.  See Strauss v. Horton, 207 P.3d 48, 120 (Cal. 2009).  In November 2010, when three \n3  Iowa state supreme court justices who had been part of a unanimous decision legalizing same-sex \n4  marriage were up for reelection, Iowa voters recalled all of them.  See A. G. Sulzberger, Ouster of \n5  Iowa Judges Sends Signal to Bench, N.Y. Times (Nov. 3, 201 0). \n6  Beyond these state ballot initiatives, the relatively recent passages of anti-sodomy laws \n7  singling out same-sex conduct, such as the Texas law the Supreme Court ultimately invalidated \n8  in Lawrence, indicate that gays and lesbians lack the consistent \"ability to attract the [favorable] \n9  attention of the lawmakers.\"  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445. \nI 0  This is not to say that the political process is closed entirely to gay and lesbian people. \nII  But complete foreclosure from meaningful political participation is not the standard by which the \n12  Supreme Court has judged \"political powerlessness.\"  When the Court ruled in 1973 that gender-\n13  based classifications were subject to heightened scrutiny, Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 \n14  (1973), women already had won major political victories including a constitutional amendment \n15  granting the right to vote and protection against employment discrimination under Title VII.  As \n16  Frontiero makes clear, the \"political power\" factor does not require a complete absence of \n17  political protection, and its application is not intended to change with every political success.12 \n18  iv.  Sexual Orientation Bears No Relation to \nLegitimate Policy Objectives or Ability to \n19  Perform or Contribute to Society. \n20  Even where other factors might point toward heightened scrutiny, the Court has declined \n21  to treat as suspect those classifications that generally bear on \"ability to perform or contribute to \n22  society.\" See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (mental disability not a suspect classification) (internal \n23 \n24  12  In dete1mining that gender classifications warranted heightened scrutiny, the plurality in \nFrontiero noted that \"in part because of past discrimination, women are vastly underrepresented \n25 \nin this Nation's decision-making councils.  There has never been a female President, nor a female \n26  member of this comi.  Not a single woman presently sits in the United States Senate, and only 14 \nwomen hold seats in the House of Representatives.\"  411 U.S. at 686 n. 17 (plurality opinion). \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: /Ocv257-JSW  16 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page24 of 31\n1  quotation omitted); see also Mass. Bd. ofR  etirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 315 (1976) (age \n2  not a suspect classification). \n3  Sexual orientation is not such a classification.  As the history described above makes \n4  clear, prior discrimination against gay and lesbian people has been rested not on their ability to \n5  contribute to society, but on the basis of invidious and long-discredited views that gays and \n6  lesbians are, for example, sexual deviants or mentally ill.  See Part I.A. I .i., supra.  As the \n7  American Psychiatric Association stated more than 35 years ago, \"homosexuality per se implies \n8  no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability or general social or vocational capabilities.\" \n9  Resolution of the Am. Psychiatric Ass'n (Dec. I 5, 1973); see also Minutes oft he Annual Meeting \n10  of the Council ofR  epresentatives, 30 Am. Psychologist 620, 633 (1975) (reflecting a similar \n11  American Psychological Association statement). \n12  Just as a person's gender, race, or religion does not bear an inherent relation to a person's \n13  ability or capacity to contribute to society, a person's sexual orientation bears no inherent relation \n14  to ability to perform or contribute.  President Obama elaborated on this principle in the context of \n15  the military when he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of2010: \n16  [S]acrifice, valor and integrity are no more defined by sexual orientation than they are by \nrace or gender, religion or creed .... There will never be a full accounting of the heroism \n17  demonstrated by gay Americans in service to this country; their service has been obscured \nin history.  It's been lost to prejudices that have waned in our own lifetimes.  But at every \n18  turn, every crossroads in our past, we know gay Americans fought just as hard, gave just \nas much to protect this nation and the ideals for which it stands. \n19 \nWhite House, Remarks by the President and Vice President at Signing of the Don't Ask, Don't \n20 \nTell Repeal Act of2010 (Dec. 22, 2010), available at \n21 \nhttp://www. whitehouse. gov /the-press-office/20 10 / 12/22/remarks-presi dent- and-vice-president -si \n22 \ngning -don't- ask -don't-tell-repeal -a. \n23 \nThe Supreme Court has also recognized that, although opposition to homosexuality, \n24 \nthough it may reflect deeply held personal religious and moral views, it is not a legitimate policy \n25 \nobjective.  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577 (\"[T]he fact that a governing majority in a State has \n26 \ntraditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a Jaw \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28 \n3:10cv257-JSW  17 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page25 of 31\nI  prohibiting the practice.\"); Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (noting that a law cannot broadly disfavor \n2  gays and lesbians because of\"personal or religious objections to homosexuality.\" (internal \n3  quotation omitted)),  Whether premised on pernicious stereotypes or simple moral disapproval, \n4  laws classifying on the basis of sexual orientation rest on a \"factor [that] generally provides no \n5  sensible ground for differential treatment,\" see Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441, and thus such laws \n6  merit heightened scrutiny. \n7  B.  DOMA FAILS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY. \n8  For the reasons described above, heightened scrutiny is the appropriate standard by which \n9  to review classifications based on sexual orientation, including DOMA Section 3.13  In reviewing \n10  a legislative classification under heightened scrutiny, the government must establish, at a \nII  minimum, that the classification is \"substantially related to an important government objective.\" \n12  Clark, 586 U.S. at 461.  Moreover, under any form of heightened scrutiny, a statute must be \n13  defended by reference to the \"actual [governmental] purpose\" behind it, not a different \n14  \"rationalization.\"  VMI, 518 U.S. at 535-36. \n15  Section 3 fails this analysis.14  First, the legislative history demonstrates that the statute \n16  was motivated in significant part by animus towards gays and lesbians and their intimate and \n17  family relationships.15  Among the interests expressly identified by Congress in enacting DOMA \n18 \n19  13  The government takes no position on whether sexual orientation classifications should be \nconsidered suspect, as opposed to quasi-suspect, and therefore whether DOMA should be subject \n20  to intermediate or strict scrutiny. \n21 \n14  Though the government believes that heightened scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review \nfor Section 3 of DOMA, if this Comt holds that rational basis is the appropriate standard, as the \n22 \ngovernment has previously stated, a reasonable argument for the constitutionality of DOMA \n23  Section 3 can be made under that permissive standard. \n24  15  We note that some members of the majority in Congress that enacted DOMA have changed \ntheir views on the law, and the legitimacy of its rationales, since 1996.  See, e.g., Bob Barr, No \n25 \nDefending the Defense ofM  arriage Act, L.A. Times (Jan. 5, 2009),  available at \n26  http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/newsletter/la-oe-barr5-2009jan05, \n0,2810 156.story?track=newslettertext.  In reviewing the statute under heightened scrutiny, \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: !Ocv257-JSW  18 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page26 of 31\nI  was \"the government's interest in defending traditional notions of morality.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 104-\n2  664, at 15 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2905 (\"H.R. Rep.\").  The House Report \n3  repeatedly claims that DOMA upholds \"traditional notions of morality\" by condemning \n4  homosexuality and by expressing disapproval of gays and lesbians and their committed \n5  relationships.  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. at 15-16 (\"[J]udgment [opposing same-sex marriage] entails \n6  both moral disapproval of homosexuality and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better \n7  comports with traditional (especially Judea-Christian) morality.\"); id. at 16 (stating that same-sex \n8  marriage \"legitimates a public union, a legal status that most people  ... feel ought to be \n9  illegitimate\" and \"put[ s] a stamp of approval ... on a union that many people ... think is \n10  immoral\"); id at 15 (\"Civil laws that permit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a \n11  collective moral judgment about human sexuality\"); id at 31 (favorably citing the holding in \n12  Bowers that an \"anti-sodomy law served the rational purpose of expressing the presumed belief. \n13  .. that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable\"). \n14  The House Report also explicitly stated an interest in extending legal preferences to \n15  heterosexual couples in various ways to \"promote heterosexuality\" and discourage \n16  homosexuality.  H.R. Rep. at 15 n.53 (\"Closely related to this interest in protecting traditional \n17  marriage is a corresponding interest in promoting heterosexuality. . . . Maintaining a preferred \n18  societal status of heterosexual marriage thus will also serve to encourage heterosexuality ....\" ). \n19  Thus, one of the goals ofDOMA was to provide gays and lesbians with an incentive to abandon \n20  or at least to hide from view a core aspect of their identities, which legislators regarded as \n21  immoral and inferior. \n22  This record evidences the kind of animus and stereotype-based thinking that the Equal \n23  Protection Clause is designed to guard against.  Cf Dep 't ofA  griculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. \n24  528, 534 (1973) (\"If the constitutional conception of 'equal protection of the laws' means \n25 \n26  however, what is relevant are the views of Congress at the time of enactment, as evidenced by \nthe legislative record. \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: /Ocv257-JSW  19 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page27 of 31\n1  anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular \n2  group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\"); see also Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 580 \n3  (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"[The Supreme Court] ha[s] consistently held ... that some \n4  objectives, such as a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group, are not legitimate state \n5  interests\").  And even if Congress's opposition to gay and lesbian relationships could be \n6  understood as reflecting moral or religious objections, that would remain an impermissible basis \n7  for sexual-orientation discrimination.  See supra at 17-18; Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (holding that \n8  law cannot broadly disfavor gays and lesbians because of\"personal or religious objections to \n9  homosexuality\").  Discouraging homosexuality, in other words, is not a governmental interest \n10  that justifies sexual orientation discrimination. \n11  Nor is there some other important governmental interest identified by Congress and \n12  substantially advanced by Section 3 ofDOMA, as required under heightened scrutiny.  In \n13  addition to expressing bare hostility to gay and lesbian people and their relationships, in enacting \n14  Section 3, the House Report articulated an interest in \"defending and nurturing the institution of \n15  traditional, heterosexual marriage.\"  H.R. Rep. at 12.  That interest does not support Section 3. \n16  As an initial matter, reference to tradition, no matter how long established, cannot by itself justify \n17  a discriminatory law under equal protection principles.  VMI, 518 U.S. at 535 (invalidating \n18  longstanding tradition of single-sex education at Virginia Military Institute).  But even if it were \n19  possible to identify a substantive and animus-free interest in protecting \"traditional\" marriage on \n20  this record, there would remain a gap between means and end that would invalidate Section 3 \n21  under heightened scrutiny.  Section 3 ofDOMA has no effect on recognition of the same-sex \n22  marriages Congress viewed as threatening to \"traditional\" marriage; it does not purport to defend \n23  \"traditional, heterosexual marriage\" by preventing same-sex marriage or by denying legal \n24  recognition to such marriages.  Instead, Section 3 denies benefits to couples who are already \n25  legally married in their own states, on the basis of their sexual orientation and not their marital \n26  status.  Thus, there is not the \"substantial relationship\" required under heightened scrutiny \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: /Ocv257-JSW  20 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page28 of 31\nI  between an end of defending \"traditional\" marriage and the means employed by Section 3. \n2  The same is true of Congress's interest in \"promoting responsible procreation and \n3  child-rearing,\" which the House Report identified not as a separate rationale for DOMA Section \n4  3, but as the basis for its larger interest in defending \"the institution of traditional, heterosexual \n5  marriage.\" See, e.g., H. Rep. at 12-13 (\"At bottom, civil society has an interest in maintaining \n6  and protecting the institution of heterosexual marriage because it has a deep and abiding interest \n7  in encouraging responsible procreation and child-rearing.\"); id. at 14 (\"Were it not for the \n8  possibility of begetting children inherent in heterosexual unions, society would have no \n9  particular interest in encouraging citizens to come together in a committed relationship.\") \nI 0  (emphasis added).  Again, even assuming that Congress legislated on the basis of an independent \nII  and animus-free interest in promoting responsible procreation and child-rearing, that interest is \n12  not materially advanced by Section 3 of DOMA and so cannot justify that provision under \n13  heightened scrutiny. \n14  First, there is no sound basis for concluding that same-sex couples who have committed \n15  to marriages recognized by state law are anything other than fully capable of responsible \n16  parenting and child-rearing.  To the contrary, many leading medical, psychological, and social \n17  welfare organizations have issued policies opposing restrictions on lesbian and gay parenting \n18  based on their conclusions, supported by numerous studies, that children raised by gay and \n19  lesbian parents are as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents.  See, \n20  e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics, Coparent or Second-Parent Adoption by 16 Same-Sex \n21  Parents (Feb. 2002), available at \n22  http:// aappolicy .aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics; I 09/2/3 3 9; American \n23  Psychological Association, Sexual Orientation, Parents, & Children (July 2004), available at \n24  http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/parenting.aspx; American Academy of \n25  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, or Transgender Parents Policy \n26  Statement (Oct. 2008), available at \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: /Ocv257-JSW  21 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page29 of 31\n1  http://www .aacap.org/cs/root/policy_ statements/gay_ lesbian_t rans gender_ and_b isexual _parents_ \n2  policy_statement; American Medical Association, AMA Policy Regarding Sexual Orientation, \n3  available at http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/ pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-\n4  sections/glbt-advisorycommittee/arna-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.shtml; Child Welfare \n5  League of America, Position Statement on Parenting of Children by Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual \n6  Adults, available at http://www.cwla.org/ prograrns/culture/glbtqposition.htm.  For this reason \n7  alone, no penalty or prohibition on same-sex marriage can be \"substantially\" related to an interest \n8  in promoting responsible child-rearing. \n9  Second, there is no evidence in the legislative record that denying federal benefits to \nI 0  same-sex couples legally married under state law operates in any way to encourage responsible \nII  child-rearing, whether by opposite-sex or same-sex couples, and it is hard to imagine what such \n12  evidence would look like.  In enacting DOMA, Congress expressed the view that marriage plays \n13  an \"irreplaceable role\" in child-rearing.  House Report at 14.  But Section 3 does nothing to \n14  affect the stability of heterosexual marriages or the child-rearing practices of heterosexual \n15  married couples.  Instead, it denies the children of same-sex couples what Congress sees as the \n16  benefits of the stable home life produced by legally recognized marriage, and therefore, on \n17  Congress' own account, undermines rather than advances an interest in promoting child welfare. \n18  Finally, as to \"responsible procreation,\" even assuming an important governmental \n19  interest in providing benefits only to couples who procreate, Section 3 is not sufficiently tailored \n20  to that interest to survive heightened scrutiny.  Many state-recognized same-sex marriages \n21  involve families with children; many opposite-sex maniages do not.  And ability to procreate has \n22  never been a requirement of marriage or of eligibility for federal marriage benefits; opposite-sex \n23  couples who carmot procreate for reasons related to age or other physical characteristics are \n24  permitted to marry and to receive federal marriage benefits.  Cf H.R. Rep. at 14 (noting \"that \n25  society permits heterosexual couples to marry regardless of whether they intend or are even able \n26 \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: 10cv257-JSW  22 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page30 of 31\nI  to have children\" but describing this objection to DOMA as \"not a serious argument\").16 \n2  In sum, the official legislative record makes plain that DOMA Section 3 was motivated in \n3  substantial part by animus toward gay and lesbian individuals and their intimate relationships, \n4  and Congress identified no other interest that is materially advanced by Section 3.  Section 3 of \n5  DOMA is therefore unconstitutional. \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nII \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n16  The House Report also identifies preservation of scarce government resources as an interest \n21 \nunderlying Section 3 's denial of government benefits to same-sex couples married under state \nlaw.  See  H.R. Rep. at 18.  In fact, many of the rights and obligations affected by Section 3, such \n22 \nas spousal evidentiary privileges and nepotism rules, involve no expenditure of federal funds, and \n23  in other cases, exclusion of state-recognized same-sex marriages costs the government money by \npreserving eligibility for certain federal benefits.  But regardless of whether an interest in \n24 \npreserving resources could justifY Section 3 under rational basis review, it is clear that it will not \nsuffice under heightened scrutiny; the government may not single out a suspect class for \n25 \nexclusion from a benefits program solely in the interest of saving money. See Graham v. \n26  Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 374-75 (1971) (holding that state may not advance its \"valid interest \nin preserving the fiscal integrity of its programs\" through alienage-based exclusions). \n27 \nDefendants' Brief in Opposition to Motions to Dismiss \n28  3: !Ocv257-JSW  23 \n\nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document145    Filed07/01/11   Page31 of 31\nI  CONCLUSION \n2  For the reasons set forth above, Section 3 ofDOMA fails heightened scrutiny, and this \n3  Court should deny the motions to dismiss Plaintiffs constitutional claim. \n4  Dated: July I, 2011 \n5  Respectfully Submitted, \n6  MICHAEL F.

Supp. 2d 968.\nJURISDICTION\nThe judgment of the district court was entered on\nFebruary 22, 2012.  Notices of appeal were filed on Feb-\nruary 24, 2012, and February 28, 2012 (App., infra, 64a-\n(1)\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 10 of 94\n2\n65a, 66a-67a).  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 28 U.S.C. 2101(e).\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY\nPROVISIONS INVOLVED\nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are\nset forth in the appendix to this petition.  App., infra,\n70a.\nSTATEMENT\n1. a. Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act\n(DOMA or Act) in 1996.  Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 Stat.\n2419.  DOMA contains two principal provisions.  The\nfirst, Section 2 of the Act, provides that no State is re-\nquired to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial\nproceeding of another State that treats a relationship\nbetween two persons of the same sex as a marriage un-\nder its laws.  DOMA § 2, 110 Stat. 2419 (28 U.S.C.\n1738C).\nThe second provision, Section 3, which is at issue in\nthis case, defines “marriage” and “spouse” for all pur-\nposes under federal law to exclude marriages between\npersons of the same sex, including marriages recognized\nunder state law.  Section 3 provides:\nIn determining the meaning of any Act of Con-\ngress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation\nof the various administrative bureaus and agencies of\nthe United States, the word “marriage” means only\na legal union between one man and one woman as\nhusband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only\nto a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a\nwife.\nDOMA § 3, 110 Stat. 2419 (1 U.S.C. 7).\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 11 of 94\n3\nb. Congress enacted DOMA in response to the Ha-\nwaii Supreme Court’s decision in Baehr v. Lewin, 852\nP.2d 44 (1993), which held that the denial of marriage\nlicenses to same-sex couples was presumptively invalid\nunder the Hawaii Constitution.  H.R. Rep. No. 664,\n104th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1996) (1996 House Report).\nAlthough Hawaii ultimately did not permit same-sex\nmarriage, other States, including California, later recog-\nnized such marriages under their respective laws.  See\nMassachusetts v. United States Dep’t of Health & Hu-\nman Servs., Nos. 10-2204, -2207, and -2214, 2012 WL\n1948017, at *1 nn.1-2; In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d\n384 (Cal. 2008).1\nAlthough Section 3 of DOMA does not purport to\ninvalidate same-sex marriages in those States that per-\nmit them, it excludes such marriages from recognition\nfor purposes of more than 1000 federal statutes and pro-\ngrams whose administration turns in part on individuals’\nmarital status.  See U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Report\nNo. GAO-04-353R, Defense of Marriage Act: Update to\nPrior Report 1 (2004), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/\nd04353r.pdf (GAO Report) (identifying 1138 federal laws\nthat are contingent on marital status or in which marital\nstatus is a factor).  Section 3 of DOMA thus denies to\nlegally married same-sex couples many substantial ben-\n1 The California Supreme Court’s decision in In re Marriage Cases\nwas superseded by a 2008 state constitutional amendment that limited\nstate-recognized marriages to those between a man and a woman.  Cal.\nConst. Art. I, § 7.5.  That amendment did not, however, invalidate same-\nsex marriages performed before its effective date.  Strauss v. Horton,\n207 P.3d 48, 98-110, 119-122 (Cal. 2009) (interpreting the amendment to\napply prospectively only).  The Ninth Circuit later struck down the\nconstitutional amendment as invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.\nPerry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052, 1096 (2012).  The validity of that ruling\nis not at issue in this case.\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 12 of 94\n4\nefits otherwise available to legally married couples un-\nder federal employment, immigration, public health and\nwelfare, tax, and other laws.  See id. at 16-18.\n2. Respondent Golinski is a staff attorney employed\nby the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit.  App., infra, 2a.  In 2008, she married her same-\nsex partner of more than 20 years, with whom she has a\nyoung son, in California.  Ibid.; Second Am. Compl.\n¶¶ 15, 17, 19.  After they married, Golinski sought to\nenroll her spouse as a beneficiary under her federal em-\nployee “self and family” health insurance plan.  Second\nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19, 22.  The Administrative Office of\nthe United States Courts refused her request on the\nground that Section 3 of DOMA forbids extending Fed-\neral Employee Health Benefits Plan coverage to same-\nsex spouses.  Id. ¶¶ 23-24; see 5 U.S.C. 8901(5); see also\n1 U.S.C. 7.\nGolinski filed a complaint under the Ninth Circuit’s\nEmployment Dispute Resolution Plan, contending that\nthe denial of health benefits violated the Plan’s provi-\nsions forbidding discrimination on the basis of sex or\nsexual orientation.  App., infra, 2a-3a.  In a series of\norders, Chief Judge Kozinski, sitting in his administra-\ntive capacity, ruled in Golinski’s favor and ordered the\ngovernment to make health benefits available to Golin-\nski’s spouse on the same terms that an opposite-sex\nspouse would have enjoyed.  In re Golinski, 587 F.3d\n956 (9th Cir. 2009) (Kozinski, C.J.); In re Golinski, 587\nF.3d 901 (9th Cir. 2009) (Kozinski, C.J.); see App., infra,\n3a-6a.\nGolinski thereafter filed a mandamus action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District\nof California to compel compliance with Chief Judge\nKozinski’s orders.

Supp. 2d 967 (N.D. Cal. 2011); see App.,\ninfra, 5a-6a.  Golinski then filed an amended complaint\nin which she, inter alia, challenged the constitutionality\nof Section 3, as applied to deny health coverage for her\nspouse, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\nApp., infra, 7a; Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 72, 74-81.    \n3. While Golinski’s mandamus action was pending,\nthe Attorney General sent a notification to Congress\nunder 28 U.S.C. 530D that he and the President had\ndetermined that Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional\nas applied to same-sex couples who are legally married\nunder state law.  Letter from Eric H. Holder Jr., Att’y\nGen., to John A. Boehner, Speaker, U.S. House of Rep-\nresentatives (Feb. 23, 2011) (Attorney General Letter).2\nThe letter explained that, while the Department of Jus-\ntice had previously defended Section 3 in courts whose\nbinding precedent required application of rational basis\nreview to classifications based on sexual orientation, the\nPresident and the Department of Justice had conducted\na new examination of the issue after two lawsuits had\nbeen filed in a circuit that had yet to address the appro-\npriate standard of review.  Id. at 1-2.  The Attorney Gen-\neral explained that, after examining several factors this\nCourt has identified as relevant to the applicable level of\nscrutiny, including the history of discrimination against\ngay and lesbian individuals and the relevance of sexual\norientation to legitimate policy objectives, he and the\nPresident had concluded that Section 3 warrants appli-\ncation of heightened scrutiny rather than rational basis\n2 Text  available  at  http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/\n11-ag-223.html.  \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 14 of 94\n6\nreview.  Id. at 2-4.  The Attorney General further ex-\nplained that both he and the President had concluded\nthat Section 3 fails that standard of review and is there-\nfore unconstitutional.  Id. at 4-5.\nThe Attorney General’s letter reported that, notwith-\nstanding  this  determination,  the  President  had  “in-\nstructed Executive agencies to continue to comply with\nSection 3 of DOMA, consistent with the Executive’s obli-\ngation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\nunless and until Congress repeals Section 3 or the judi-\ncial branch renders a definitive verdict against the law’s\nconstitutionality.”  Attorney General Letter 5.  The At-\ntorney General explained that “[t]his course of action\nrespects the actions of the prior Congress that enacted\nDOMA, and it recognizes the judiciary as the final arbi-\nter of the constitutional claims raised.”  Ibid.  In the\ninterim, the Attorney General instructed the Depart-\nment’s lawyers to cease defense of Section 3.  Id. at 5-6.\nFinally, the Attorney General noted that the Depart-\nment’s  lawyers  would  take  appropriate  steps  to\n“provid[e] Congress a full and fair opportunity to partici-\npate” in litigation concerning the constitutionality of\nSection 3.  Id. at 6.\nFollowing  the  Attorney  General’s  announcement,\nrespondent  Bipartisan  Legal  Advisory  Group  of  the\nUnited States House of Representatives (BLAG), a five-\nmember bipartisan leadership group, moved to inter-\nvene to present a defense of the constitutionality of Sec-\ntion 3.3  The district court granted the motion.  6/3/11\nOrder 1; see App., infra, 7a.\n3 Two of the group’s five members declined to support intervention.\nBLAG Mot. to Intervene 1 n.1 (May 4, 2011).\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 15 of 94\n7\nBoth BLAG and the government moved to dismiss\nGolinski’s amended complaint challenging the constitu-\ntionality of Section 3.  While BLAG presented argu-\nments in support of Section 3’s constitutionality, the\ngovernment explained that it was filing a motion to dis-\nmiss Golinski’s constitutional claim solely for purposes\nof ensuring that the court had Article III jurisdiction to\nenter judgment for or against the federal officials tasked\nwith enforcing Section 3.  The government’s brief on the\nmerits set forth its view that heightened scrutiny applies\nto Section 3 of DOMA and that, under that standard of\nreview, Section 3 violates the equal protection guarantee\nof the Fifth Amendment.  Gov’t Br. in Opp. to Mots. to\nDismiss 2-23 (July 1, 2011).\n4. The district court denied BLAG’s motion to dis-\nmiss and granted summary judgment in favor of Golin-\nski, concluding that Section 3 of DOMA violates the\nequal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.\nApp., infra, 1a-61a.\nThe district court acknowledged that the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had previously held that laws that classify on the\nbasis of sexual orientation are subject to deferential re-\nview under a rational basis standard.  See App., infra,\n20a-21a (citing High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec.\nClearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir. 1990)).  The\ndistrict court concluded, however, that High Tech Gays\nwas no longer binding in light of intervening Supreme\nCourt precedent.  Id. at 21a-24a.  The court explained\nthat High Tech Gays had relied on this Court’s now-\noverruled decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186\n(1986), overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558\n(2003), upholding a state criminal prohibition on sodomy,\nas well as on a distinction between sexual orientation\nand same-sex behavior that this Court has since re-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 16 of 94\n8\njected, see Christian Legal Soc’y Chapter of the Univ.\nof Cal. v. Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 2990 (2010).  After\nexamining several factors bearing on the applicability of\nheightened scrutiny, including the history of discrimina-\ntion against gay and lesbian individuals and the irrele-\nvance of sexual orientation to an individual’s ability to\ncontribute to society, the district court concluded that\nheightened scrutiny applies to sexual orientation classi-\nfications.  App., infra, 25a-34a.\nThe district court held that Section 3 fails under\nheightened scrutiny.  App., infra, 34a-53a.  The court\nconcluded that none of the actual rationales underlying\nSection 3’s enactment, as set out in the House Commit-\ntee Report accompanying DOMA, provides a justifica-\ntion for the law substantially related to an important\ngovernmental  objective.    Id.  at  36a-44a  (citing  1996\nHouse Report 12-18).  The court explained that denying\nbenefits to same-sex couples who are already married\nunder state law does not substantially further any gov-\nernmental  interest  in  “responsible  procreation  and\nchild-rearing” or in “nurturing the institution of tradi-\ntional, heterosexual marriage.”  Id. at 36a; see id. at 36a-\n42a.  The court further explained that neither an inter-\nest in “defending traditional notions of morality” nor an\ninterest in “preserving scarce government resources”\njustifies Section 3’s differential treatment of same-sex\nmarried couples.  Id. at 36a; see id. at 42a-44a.\nIn the alternative, the district court held that Section\n3 fails rational basis review.  App., infra, 44a-59a.  The\ncourt concluded that none of the stated rationales for\nSection 3’s enactment bears a rational relationship to a\nlegitimate governmental objective.  Id. at 47a-53a.  The\ncourt also rejected several additional rationales offered\nby BLAG, including “preserving the status quo in the\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 17 of 94\n9\nfederal  definition  of  marriage  while  waiting  for  the\nstates to ‘tinker with the substantive centuries-old defi-\nnition of marriage,’” id. at 54a (citation omitted), “Con-\ngressional caution in [an] area of social divisiveness,” id.\nat 56a, and maintaining consistency in the provision of\nfederal benefits, id. at 58a.  The court reasoned that,\nbecause pre-DOMA federal law generally recognized\nmarriages that were valid under state law, Section 3\nneither preserves the status quo nor promotes consis-\ntency in the administration of federal programs.  Id. at\n54a-56a, 58a-59a.  And in the court’s view, “[t]he fact\nthat the issue is socially divisive” is not a rational basis\nfor “the discriminating classifications in the law.”  Id. at\n56a-58a.\n5. Both  BLAG  and  the  government  filed  timely\nnotices of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit.  App., infra, 64a-65a (government\nnotice of appeal); id. at 66a-67a (BLAG notice of appeal).\nThe  court  of  appeals  has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to\n28  U.S.C.  1291.    The  appeals  were  docketed  as\nNo. 12-15388 and No. 12-15409.\nThe government petitioned the court of appeals for\ninitial hearing en banc.  The court denied the petition.\nPet. App. 68a-69a.  The case remains pending before a\npanel of that court.  See ibid.  The case is therefore “in\nthe court[] of appeals” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n1254.  See Eugene Gressman et al., Supreme Court\nPractice § 2.4, at 83-84 (9th ed. 2007).\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION\nSection 3 of DOMA denies to same-sex couples le-\ngally married under state law significant federal bene-\nfits that are otherwise available to persons lawfully mar-\nried under state law.  Because such differential treat-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 18 of 94\n10\nment bears no substantial relationship to any important\ngovernmental objective, Section 3 violates the guarantee\nof equal protection secured by the Fifth Amendment.\nAlthough the Executive Branch agrees with the dis-\ntrict court’s determination in this case that Section 3 is\nunconstitutional, we respectfully seek this Court’s re-\nview so that the question may be authoritatively decided\nby this Court.  As explained above, to ensure that the\nJudiciary is the final arbiter of Section 3’s constitution-\nality, the President has instructed Executive depart-\nments and agencies to continue to enforce Section 3 until\nthere is a definitive judicial ruling that Section 3 is un-\nconstitutional.  Attorney General Letter 5; see p. 7, su-\npra.  As the federal entities charged with Section 3’s\nenforcement, and against whom judgment was entered\nbelow, petitioners are the proper parties to invoke this\nCourt’s power to review the court of appeals’ judgment.\nSee INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 930-931 (1983) (“When\nan agency of the United States is a party to a case in\nwhich the Act of Congress it administers is held uncon-\nstitutional,” it may appeal that decision, even though\n“the Executive may agree with the holding that the stat-\nute in question is unconstitutional.”); United States v.\nLovett, 328 U.S. 303, 306-307 (1946) (reviewing constitu-\ntionality of a congressional enactment on the petition of\nthe Solicitor General, even though the Solicitor General\nagreed with the lower court’s holding that the statute\nwas unconstitutional); see United States v. Lovett, 327\nU.S. 773 (1946) (granting Solicitor General’s petition for\na writ of certiorari).4\n4 The fact that the government agrees with respondent Golinski  that\nSection 3 is unconstitutional does not prevent this Court from resolving\nthat issue.  Cf., e.g., National Fed’n of Indep. Businesses v. Sebelius,\nNo. 11-393 (June 28, 2012), slip op. 11.  Consistent with 28 U.S.C. 530D\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 19 of 94\n11\nThe government is today filing a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari seeking review of the decision of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Massa-\nchusetts v. United States Department of Health & Hu-\nman Services, Nos. 10-2204, -2207, and -2214, 2012 WL\n1948017 (May 31, 2012), which invalidated Section 3 as\nviolative of the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection\nguarantee.  Certiorari before judgment is warranted\nunder the exceptional circumstances of this case to en-\nsure that this Court has an adequate vehicle to resolve\nthe question of Section 3’s constitutionality in a timely\nand definitive manner.  Authoritative resolution of the\nquestion presented is of great importance to the United\nStates and to respondent Golinski and tens of thousands\nand prior practice in cases in which the Department has declined to\ndefend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress, the Attorney Gen-\neral notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Presi-\ndent of the Senate, and other congressional leaders of the Department’s\nposition in this case.  The Department did not oppose the subsequent\nintervention by BLAG for the purpose of presenting arguments in\nsupport of the constitutionality of Section 3.  Although the interest of\nMembers of Congress in the constitutionality of a federal statute does\nnot confer standing on them to invoke this Court’s power to review a\njudgment entered against the Executive Branch petitioners to prevent\nthem from implementing the statute, see, e.g., Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S.\n811 (1997); Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986); Valley Forge\nChristian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State,\n454 U.S. 464, 482-483 (1982); Newdow v. United States Congress, 313\nF.3d 495, 499-500 (9th Cir. 2002), with the case now before this Court\non this petition filed by the Executive Branch petitioners, it is appropri-\nate for BLAG to present arguments in defense of the validity of the\nmeasure.  See, e.g., Lovett, 328 U.S. at 306-307 (after this Court granted\nthe petition for a writ of certiorari filed by the Solicitor General on\nbehalf of the United States, counsel for Congress appeared to present\nargument in support of the constitutionality of the challenged legisla-\ntion).\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 20 of 94\n12\nof others who are being denied the equal enjoyment of\nthe benefits that federal law makes available to persons\nwho are legally married under state law.\nA. Review Of The Constitutionality Of DOMA Section 3 Is\nWarranted\nReview is warranted in this case because the court\nbelow invalidated an Act of Congress as unconstitu-\ntional.  As the government explained in its petition for a\nwrit of certiorari in Massachusetts, the question of Sec-\ntion 3’s constitutionality raises important questions of\nfederal law that have not been, but should be, settled by\nthis Court.  Massachusetts Pet. 14-22.  \nAs the petition in Massachusetts further explains,\nalthough every court of appeals to address the issue has\nconcluded that classifications based on sexual orienta-\ntion are subject to rational basis review, none has of-\nfered an explanation for that conclusion that withstands\nscrutiny under this Court’s precedents.  Massachusetts\nPet. 18-21.  In the decision below, the district court con-\ncluded that Ninth Circuit precedent applying rational\nbasis review to sexual orientation classifications is irrec-\noncilable with intervening Supreme Court precedent.\nSee App., infra, 21a-23a (criticizing High Tech Gays v.\nDefense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563 (9th\nCir. 1990)).  The court further concluded that each factor\nbearing on the applicability of heightened scrutiny, in-\ncluding whether the challenged legislation targets a\nclass of individuals who have historically suffered dis-\ncrimination on the basis of a characteristic not ordinarily\nrelevant to state decisionmaking, counsels in favor of\napplying heightened scrutiny to classifications based on\nsexual orientation.  Id. at 25a-34a.\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 21 of 94\n13\nThe district court concluded that Section 3 cannot\nsurvive under heightened scrutiny because the denial of\nfederal benefits to same-sex couples who are legally\nmarried under their States’ laws bears no substantial\nrelationship to any important governmental purpose\nthat motivated Section 3’s enactment.  App., infra, 36a-\n44a.  Alternatively, the district court concluded that Sec-\ntion 3 would fail even rational basis review because Sec-\ntion 3 is not rationally related to any conceivable legiti-\nmate interest of the federal government.  Id. at 44a-59a.\nThis case squarely raises important questions about\nthe Constitution’s equal protection guarantee as it ap-\nplies to a federal statute that draws distinctions among\npersons who are legally married under their States’ laws\non the basis of their sexual orientation.  For the reasons\ngiven in the government’s Massachusetts petition, those\nquestions, and the ultimate question of the constitution-\nality of Section 3 of DOMA, warrant authoritative reso-\nlution by this Court.\nB. The Exceptional Public Importance Of The Question\nPresented Warrants Granting Certiorari Before Judg-\nment\nIn this case, unlike Massachusetts, the court of ap-\npeals has not yet reviewed the judgment.  But also un-\nlike Massachusetts, the lower court in this case engaged\nin de novo consideration of the applicable level of scru-\ntiny, having concluded that it was not bound by circuit\nprecedent applying rational basis review to sexual orien-\ntation classifications.

Under this Court’s rules, a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari before judgment in a case pending in a court\nof appeals will be granted “only upon a showing that the\ncase is of such imperative public importance as to justify\nthe deviation from normal appellate practice and to re-\nquire immediate determination in this Court.”  Sup. Ct.\nR. 11.\nThis Court has previously granted certiorari before\njudgment when necessary to obtain expeditious resolu-\ntion of exceptionally important legal questions. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Fanfan, 543 U.S. 220, 229 (2005) (con-\nstitutionality of mandatory applications of the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines); Gratz v.

See, e.g., Fanfan, 543 U.S. at 229 (de-\ncided with United States v.

Bankers’ Trust\nCo., 294 U.S. 240, 243 (1935) (Court granted United\nStates’ petition for certiorari before judgment where\nanother case presenting same issue was already pending\nbefore the Court).\n2. The government is today filing a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari to the First Circuit in Massachusetts,\nsupra.  A grant of certiorari before judgment in this\ncase is warranted to ensure that the Court will have an\nappropriate vehicle in which to resolve the issues pre-\nsented in a timely and definitive fashion.\nAssurance that the Court will have a vehicle in which\nto reach and resolve the important issues presented is\nwarranted in light of the great public importance of the\nissues at stake.  Section 3 applies to more than 1000 fed-\neral statutes and programs whose administration de-\npends in part on marital status.  See GAO Report 1.  The\nissues decided below therefore have an important im-\npact on the conduct of a wide array of Executive func-\ntions.  Consistent with the President’s instruction to\ncontinue enforcement of Section 3 pending final judicial\nresolution of its constitutionality, so as to ensure that\nthe Judiciary is the final arbiter of the constitutional\nquestion, Executive departments and agencies will con-\ntinue to deny federal benefits to scores of affected indi-\nviduals until this Court reaches a definitive resolution of\nthe question presented.

Defendants the United States Office\nof Personnel Management (“the OPM”) and John Berry,\nits director, also filed a motion to dismiss and a response\nto BLAG’s motion to dismiss.  These motions compel the\nCourt to determine whether the Defense of Marriage\nAct (“DOMA”), 1 U.S.C. Section 7, as applied to Ms.\n(1a)\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 26 of 94\n2a\nGolinski, violates the United States Constitution by re-\nfusing to recognize lawful marriages in the application\nof laws governing benefits for federal employees.  Hav-\ning considered the parties’ papers, relevant legal author-\nity, and the record in this case, the Court HEREBY DE-\nNIES BLAG’s motion to dismiss; DENIES as moot\nBLAG’s motion to strike; GRANTS Ms. Golinski’s mo-\ntion for summary judgment; and GRANTS the OPM’s\nmotion to dismiss. \nBACKGROUND \n  The pertinent facts are not in dispute.  Ms. Golinski\nis a staff attorney in the Motions Unit of the Office of\nStaff Attorneys in the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit.  (Second Amended Complaint\n(“SAC”) at ¶ 18.)  Ms. Golinski has been partners with\nAmy Cunninghis (“Ms. Cunninghis”) for over twenty\nyears. They registered as domestic partners with the\nCity and County of San Francisco in 1995, and with the\nState of California in 2003.  (Id. at ¶¶ 15-17.)  On August\n21, 2008, they were legally married under the laws of the\nState of California.  (Id. at ¶ 17.)\n  Shortly after they married, Ms. Golinski sought to\nenroll Ms. Cunninghis in her existing family coverage\nhealth insurance plan, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ser-\nvice Benefit Plan, which she purchases through her em-\nployer and which already covers the couple’s adopted\nminor child.  (Id. at ¶¶ 19, 22.)  The Administrative Of-\nfice of the United States Courts (“AO”) refused to pro-\ncess her request on the basis that Ms. Golinski and her\nspouse are both women.  (Id. at ¶ 23.)  Finding that she\ncould not secure comparable health insurance coverage,\non October 2, 2008, Ms. Golinski filed a complaint under\nthe Ninth Circuit’s Employment Dispute Resolution\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 27 of 94\n3a\n(“EDR”) Plan, and contended that the refusal to grant\nher health benefits was a violation of the Plan’s nondis-\ncrimination provision.  (Id. at ¶ 48.)  The EDR Plan spe-\ncifically prohibits employment discrimination based on,\namong other things, sex or sexual orientation.  (Id. at\n¶ 47.) \nBy orders dated November 24, 2008 and January 13,\n2009, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, sitting in his adminis-\ntrative capacity as arbiter of the Judicial Council, found\nthat Ms. Golinski had suffered discrimination under the\nCourt’s EDR Plan and ordered the AO to process her\nhealth benefit election forms.  (Id., Exs. A, B.)  Chief\nJudge Kozinski found that the denial of health benefits\nwas based solely on the grounds of sex and sexual orien-\ntation,  in  direct  violation  of  the  EDR  Plan’s  non-\ndiscrimination provision covering Ninth Circuit employ-\nees.  (Id., Ex. B at 1-2.)  Chief Judge Kozinski found\nthat, regardless of the language in DOMA, the OPM had\nthe discretion to extend health benefits to Ms. Golinski’s\nsame-sex spouse by interpreting the terms “family mem-\nbers” and “member of the family” to set a floor, not a\nceiling, to coverage eligibility.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Chief Judge\nKozinski ordered the AO “to submit Karen Golinski’s\nHealth Benefits Election form 2089  .  .  .  to the appro-\npriate  insurance  carrier.    Any  future  health  benefit\nforms are also to be processed without regard to the sex\nof the listed spouse.”  (Id., Ex. B at 7.) \nThe AO complied, but the OPM instructed Ms. Go-\nlinski’s insurance carrier not to comply with the Ninth\nCircuit Judicial Council’s remedial order.  The OPM\ndirected the AO and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ser-\nvice Benefit Plan not to process Ms. Golinski’s request\non the basis that federal law, specifically Section 3 of\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 28 of 94\n4a\nDOMA, defines spouse as a member of the opposite sex\nand,  accordingly,  proscribes  the  enrollment  of  Ms.\nGolinski’s same-sex spouse in her health benefits pro-\ngram. \nIn response, on November 19, 2009, Chief Judge\nKozinski issued another order addressing the OPM’s\nconduct.  The Chief Judge, again sitting as an adminis-\ntrator, held that he had the authority, under both the\nNinth Circuit’s EDR Plan and the separation of powers\ndoctrine, to interpret the laws applicable to judicial em-\nployees in a manner that would displace “any contrary\ninterpretation by an agency or an officer of the Execu-\ntive.”  (Id., Ex. C at 14-15.)  Chief Judge Kozinski held\nthat allowing the OPM to interfere with his orders would\nbe tantamount to permitting it to exercise “dominance\nover logistics to destroy [the Judiciary’s] autonomy.”\n(Id. at 11.)  The Chief Judge further held that “[o]r-\ndering enrollment is proper and within my jurisdiction\nbecause Congress intended [the EDR] tribunal to be the\nsole forum for adjudicating complaints of workplace dis-\ncrimination by employees of the Judiciary.  With that\nresponsibility must come power equal to the task.”  (Id.\nat 9.) \nChief Judge Kozinski granted Ms. Golinski both back\npay and prospective relief.  The injunctive relief re-\nquired that the OPM “rescind its guidance or directive\nto the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit plan\nand any other plan that Ms. Golinski’s wife is not eligible\nto be enrolled as her spouse under the terms of the Fed-\neral Employees Health Benefits Program because of her\nsex or sexual orientation, or that the plans would violate\ntheir contracts with the OPM by enrolling Ms. Golinski’s\nwife as a beneficiary” and “[c]ease at once its interfer-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 29 of 94\n5a\nence with the jurisdiction of this tribunal.  Specifically,\nOPM shall not advise Ms. Golinski’s health plan, the\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan, that\nproviding  coverage  for  Ms.  Golinski’s  wife  violates\nDOMA or any other federal law.  Nor shall OPM inter-\nfere in any way with the delivery of health benefits to\nMs. Golinski’s wife on the basis of her sex or sexual ori-\nentation.”  (Id. at 15-16 (emphasis in original).)  \nThe Chief Judge, in his order dated November 19,\n2009, also invited the OPM to “appeal so much of this\norder as concerns it using the procedures outlines in the\n[EDR] plan.”  (Id. at 16.)  In response, the OPM did not\nappeal the order, but instead issued a press release indi-\ncating that it was under no obligation to comply with the\nadministrative order and, although in favor of its repeal,\nindicated that the Executive agency was tasked with\nenforcing DOMA, which prohibits same-sex spouses of\nfederal employees from enrolling in the federal health\nbenefits program.  (Id., Ex. F.) \nIn his final administrative order, dated December 22,\n2009, Chief Judge Kozinski stated that the time for ap-\npeal had expired, thus rendering his prior orders in the\nmatter  “final  and  preclusive  on  all  issues  decided\ntherein.”    (Id.,  Ex.  D.)    He  further  authorized  Ms.\nGolinski to pursue any action she deemed fit against the\nOPM, including filing a mandamus action in the district\ncourt.  (Id.) \nOn January 20, 2010, Ms. Golinski filed a mandamus\naction before this Court, seeking to have the OPM re-\nscind its guidance to Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service\nBenefit Plan to deny Ms. Golinski’s wife benefits as pre-\ncluded  by  DOMA  and  to  comply  with  Chief  Judge\nKozinski’s prior orders in her administrative claim. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 30 of 94\n6a\nOn January 26, 2010, Ms. Golinski moved for a pre-\nliminary injunction seeking compliance with Chief Judge\nKozinski’s order dated November 19, 2009, requiring\nthat the OPM:  (1) “rescind its guidance or directive to\nthe Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan,”\nand (2) “cease at once its interference with the jurisdic-\ntion of this tribunal” and “not advise Ms. Golinski’s\nhealth plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service\nBenefit plan, that providing coverage for Ms. Golinski’s\nwife violates DOMA or any other federal law.”  (Id. at\nEx. C, 15-16.) \nOn May 10, 2010, the OPM moved to dismiss the\nFirst Amended Complaint on the basis that this Court\nlacked  jurisdiction  to  grant  mandamus  relief  under\nthese peculiar procedural circumstances. \nWhile those motions were pending and after the par-\nties submitted supplemental briefing on the issue of the\nconstitutionality of DOMA, on February 23, 2011, at the\ndirection of President Obama, Attorney General Eric\nHolder announced that the Justice Department would\ncease its legal defense of Section 3 of DOMA.  Although\nit determined that the statute was unconstitutional and\nresolved not to continue to defend DOMA in pending\ncourt cases, the Justice Department indicated that it did\nintend to continue to enforce the law unless it was either\nrepealed by Congress or the courts rendered a final\njudgment striking it down.  (See Plaintiff’s Notice of\nSupplemental Authority (“NSA”) dated February 23,\n2011, Ex. 2.) \nOn March 16, 2011, the Court granted the motion to\ndismiss on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to issue\nmandamus relief.  Finding that amendment would not\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 31 of 94\n7a\nnecessarily be futile, the Court dismissed the matter\nwith leave to amend.  \nOn April 14, 2011, Ms. Golinski filed her Second\nAmended Complaint in which she directly challenges the\ndiscrimination against her as a lesbian married to some-\none of the same sex.  (SAC at ¶ 1.)  In her amended com-\nplaint, Ms. Golinski alleges an action for declaratory and\ninjunctive  relief  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  Sections\n2201-2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 and\nfor review of an agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Sec-\ntions 701-706.  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  By her amended complaint,\nMs. Golinski seeks a determination that Section 3 of\nDOMA, 1 U.S.C. Section 7, as applied to her, violates the\nUnited States Constitution by refusing to recognize law-\nful marriages for the purposes of application of the laws\ngoverning benefits for federal employees.  (Id.)  Ms.\nGolinski alleges that as a result of the violation of the\nConstitution, she has been denied, and will continue to\nbe denied, legal protections and benefits under federal\nlaw that would be available to her if she were a hetero-\nsexual with a opposite-sex spouse.  (Id.) \nThe majority of a five-member committee in Con-\ngress  voted  to  defend  DOMA  and,  on  May  4,  2011,\nBLAG sought to intervene in this matter.  On June 3,\n2011, this Court issued an order granting BLAG’s unop-\nposed motion to intervene as a party-defendant for the\nlimited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Sec-\ntion 3 of DOMA. \nOn June 3, 2011, BLAG moved to dismiss the Second\nAmended Complaint on the basis that Ms. Golinski fails\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted be-\ncause, as a matter of law, Section 3 of DOMA does not\nviolate her rights under the equal protection component\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 32 of 94\n8a\nof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On\nthe same date, the OPM moved to dismiss Ms. Golinski’s\nclaim as set forth in the Second Amended Complaint\nonly insofar as any claims could reasonably be construed\nto assert a statutory claim as to the language of the Fed-\neral Health Benefits Act of 1959.  On July 1, 2011, Ms.\nGolinski moved for summary judgment.  On July 15,\n2011, BLAG moved to strike extrinsic materials from\nthe record on Ms. Golinski’s opposition to the motion to\ndismiss.  The Court heard oral argument on the motions\non December 16, 2011.1\nThe Court shall address additional facts as necessary\nin the remainder of this order. \nANALYSIS \nA. Legal Standards. \n1. Motion to Dismiss. \nA motion to dismiss is proper under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) where the pleadings fail to state\na claim upon which relief can be granted.  The Court’s\n“inquiry is limited to the allegations in the complaint,\nwhich are accepted as true and construed in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.”  Lazy Y Ranch Ltd. v.\nBehrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008).  Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 8(a) requires only “a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is enti-\ntled to relief.”  Even under Rule 8(a)’s liberal pleading\nstandard,  “a  plaintiff’s  obligation  to  provide  the\n1 Initially, BLAG moved to strike several declarations submitted by\nMs. Golinski in response to the motion to dismiss.  However, as the\nCourt decides the motion for summary judgment and has therefore con-\nsidered the full record, BLAG agreed to withdraw its motion to strike.\nThe motion to strike is therefore DENIED as moot.\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 33 of 94\n9a\n‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more\nthan labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of\nthe elements of a cause of action will not do.  Bell Atlan-\ntic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)\n(citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)).\nPursuant to Twombly, a plaintiff must not merely\nallege conduct that is conceivable but must instead al-\nlege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plau-\nsible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  “A claim has facial plausi-\nbility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that al-\nlows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  “The plausibility standard\nis not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for\nmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\nunlawfully.  .  .  .  When a complaint pleads facts that are\nmerely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops\nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of\nentitlement to relief.”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 556-57) (internal quotation marks omitted).  If the\nallegations  are  insufficient  to  state  a  claim,  a  court\nshould grant leave to amend, unless amendment would\nbe futile.  See, e.g., Reddy v. Litton Industries, Inc., 912\nF.2d 291, 296 (9th Cir. 1990); Cook, Perkiss and Liehe,\nInc. v. Northern California Collection Service, Inc., 911\nF.2d 242, 246-47 (9th Cir. 1990). \nAs a general rule, “a district court may not consider\nany material beyond the pleadings in ruling on a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion.”  Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 453\n(9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other grounds, Galbraith v.\nCounty of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(citation omitted).  The Court may consider the facts\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 34 of 94\n10a\nalleged in the complaint, documents attached to the com-\nplaint, documents relied upon but not attached to the\ncomplaint, when the authenticity of those documents is\nnot questioned, and other matters of which the Court\ncan take judicial notice.  Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digi-\nmarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 990 (9th Cir. 2009).  Docu-\nments whose contents are alleged in a complaint and\nwhose authenticity no party questions, but which are not\nphysically attached to the pleading, may be considered\nin ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  Such con-\nsideration does not convert the motion to dismiss into a\nmotion for summary judgment.  See United States v.\nRitchie, 343 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003); Branch, 14\nF.3d at 454. \n2. Motion for Summary Judgment. \nA motion for summary judgment is guided by a dif-\nferent standard.  Summary judgment is appropriate\nwhen the record demonstrates “that there is no genuine\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c).  An issue is “genuine” if there is sufficient evi-\ndence  for  a  reasonable  fact  finder  to  find  for  the\nnon-moving party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 248-49 (1986).  “[A]t the summary judgment\nstage the judge’s function is not  .  .  .  to weigh the evi-\ndence and determine the truth of the matter but to de-\ntermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id.\nat 249.  A fact is “material” if it may affect the outcome\nof the case.  Id. at 248.  The party moving for summary\njudgment bears the initial responsibility of identifying\nthose portions of the record which demonstrate the ab-\nsence of a genuine issue of a material fact.  Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  In the absence of\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 35 of 94\n11a\nsuch facts, “the moving party is entitled to a judgment\nas a matter of law.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \nOnce the moving party meets this initial burden, the\nnon-moving party “may not rest upon the mere allega-\ntions or denials of the adverse party’s pleading, but the\nadverse party’s response, by affidavits or as otherwise\nprovided in this rule, must set forth specific facts show-\ning that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(e).  If the non-moving party fails to make this\nshowing, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \nB. Defense of Marriage Act.\nThis action presents a challenge to the constitutional-\nity of Section 3 of DOMA as applied to Ms. Golinski, a\nlesbian woman married under California law, who is un-\nable to secure federal health benefits for her same-sex\nspouse.  Specifically, Ms. Golinski alleges that, by opera-\ntion of Section 3 of DOMA, she has been denied certain\nmarriage-based federal benefits that are available to\nsimilarly-situated opposite-sex couples, in violation of\nher rights to equal protection and due process as se-\ncured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\nment. \nIn 1996, Congress enacted and President Clinton\nsigned DOMA into law. Section 3 of DOMA, the only\nprovision at issue in this matter, defines the terms “mar-\nriage” and “spouse” for purposes of federal law.  Section\n3 provides: \nIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nor of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the\nvarious administrative bureaus and agencies of the\nUnited States, the word “marriage” means only a\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 36 of 94\n12a\nlegal union between one man and one woman as hus-\nband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only to\na person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a\nwife. \n1 U.S.C. § 7. \nIn large part, the enactment of DOMA can be under-\nstood as a direct legislative response to Baehr v. Lewin,\na 1993 decision issued by the Hawaii Supreme Court,\nwhich indicated that same-sex couples may be entitled\nto marry under that state’s constitution.  74 Haw. 530\n(1993).  The decision raised the possibility that, for the\nfirst time, same-sex couples could begin the process of\nobtaining state-sanctioned marriage licenses.  \nIn debating the provisions of DOMA, the House ref-\nerenced the Baehr decision as the beginning of an “or-\nchestrated assault being waged against traditional het-\nerosexual marriage” and expressed concern that the\ndevelopment  “threaten[ed]  to  have  very  real  conse-\nquences  .  .  .  on federal law.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-664 at\n2-3 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2905, 2906-07\n(“H. Rep.” or “House Report”).  More specifically, the\nHouse Report warned that “a redefinition of marriage in\nHawaii to include homosexual couples could make such\ncouples eligible for a whole range of federal rights and\nbenefits.”  Id. at 10.  Although a later amendment to the\nHawaii constitution withheld permitting same-sex mar-\nriage in the state, Congress, explicitly in reaction to the\nimpending Hawaii decision, sought a means both (1) to\n“reserve[] each State’s ability to decide” what should\nlegally constitute a valid marriage under its own state\nlaws, and (2) to “lay[] down clear rules” regarding what\nconstitutes a marriage for purposes of federal law.  Id.\nat 2. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 37 of 94\n13a\nIn Section 2 of DOMA, Congress, by virtue of the\nexpress grant of authority under the second sentence of\nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause, permitted a state to\ndecline to give effect to the laws of other states respect-\ning same-sex marriage.  In enacting Section 3 of DOMA,\nthe House Report explained that the statute codifies the\ndefinition of marriage set forth in “the standard law dic-\ntionary,” for purposes of federal law.  Id. at 29 (citing\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 972 (6th ed. 1990)). \nThe legislative history reveals that Congress ac-\nknowledged the constraints imposed by federalism on\nthe determination of who may marry, which has always\nbeen uniquely the province of state law.  Nonetheless,\nCongress asserted that it was not “supportive of (or\neven indifferent to) the notion of same-sex marriage,”\nand it embraced DOMA as a step toward furthering Con-\ngress’ interests in “defend[ing] the institution of tradi-\ntional heterosexual marriage.”  Id. at 12.  “Although\nDOMA drastically amended the eligibility criteria for a\nvast number of different federal benefits, rights, and\nprivileges that depend upon marital status, the relevant\ncommittees did not engage in a meaningful examination\nof the scope or effect of the law.” Gill v.

Id. \nIt is clear and undisputed that the federal health\nbenefits Ms. Golinski seeks in trying to add her wife as\na beneficiary under her health benefits plan falls under\nthe reach of DOMA.  The Federal Employees Health\nBenefits Program (“FEHB”) is a comprehensive pro-\ngram providing health insurance for federal civilian em-\nployees and their family members.  5 U.S.C. § 8905.  The\nOPM administers the FEHB and negotiates contracts\nfor coverage with potential carriers and sets the premi-\nums for each plan.  Id., §§ 8902, 8903, 8906.  A federal\nemployee enrolled in the FEHB chooses a carrier and\nplan and may determine whether to enroll for an individ-\nual plan, named “self only,” or for “self and family” cov-\nerage which, under the OPM’s regulations, “includes all\nfamily members who are eligible to be covered by the\nenrollment.”    5  C.F.R.  §  890.302(a)(1).    Under  the\nFEHB, a “member of family” is defined as either “the\nspouse of an employee  .  .  .  [or] an unmarried depend-\nent child under 22 years of age.”  5 U.S.C. § 8901(5).  An\nemployee enrolled under an individual plan may change\nto family coverage by submitting documentation to the\nemploying office during the annual open season period\nor within sixty days of a change in family status, such as\nchange  in  marital  status.

Equal  Protection  Analysis  and  Standard  of\nReview. \nThe “Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment commands that no State shall deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\nlaws, which is essentially a direction that all persons\nsimilarly  situated  should  be  treated  alike.”    City  of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985) (internal citations omitted).  Although the Fifth\n3 At the administrative appeal from the denial of benefits, Chief\nJudge Kozinski found that the FEHB statute confers on the OPM the\ndiscretion to extend health benefits to same-sex couples by interpreting\nthe terms “family members” and “member of the family” to set a floor,\nnot a ceiling, to coverage eligibility.  (SAC, Ex. B at 2-3.)  The Court\nfinds this reasoning unpersuasive. \nWhere the statute unambiguously defines a term such as “member\nof family” to mean spouse (or dependent child under 22 years old), that\ndefinition controls to the exclusion of any meaning that is not explicitly\nstated in the definition.  See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 393 n.10\n(1979); see also TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 28-29 (2001) (holding\nthat, for purposes of statutory construction, expression of one thing is\nthe exclusion of the other).  DOMA offers the same clarity and defines\n“spouse” for the purposes of determining the meaning of federal legis-\nlation as “a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” 1\nU.S.C. § 7.  Confronted with such unambiguous statutory language, the\nCourt is not persuaded that the FEHB statute could provide the OPM\nwith the discretion to provide health benefits to same-sex couples.  See\nIn re Levenson, 587 F.3d 925, 930-31 (9th Cir. 2009); Gill, 699 F. Supp.\n2d at 385-86.  This disposes of Ms. Golinski’s remaining statutory claim\nand the OPM’s motion to dismiss that claim, to the extent it is still as-\nserted, is GRANTED.\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 40 of 94\n16a\nAmendment to the United States Constitution does not\ncontain an Equal Protection Clause, the Fifth Amend-\nment’s Due Process Clause includes an equal protection\ncomponent.

This principle em-\nbodies a commitment to neutrality where the rights of\nindividual persons are at stake.  Dragovich v. United\nStates Department of the Treasury, 764 F. Supp. 2d\n1178, 1188 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Romer, 517 U.S. at\n623.)  It is because of this commitment to neutrality that\nlegislative provisions which arbitrarily or irrationally\ncreate discrete classes cannot withstand constitutional\nscrutiny.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 623.  “Equal protection of\nthe laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposi-\ntion of inequalities.”  Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629,\n635 (1950) (quoting Shelley v.

Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 271-72 (1979).  In an attempt to\nreconcile the promise of equal protection with the reality\nof lawmaking, courts apply the most searching constitu-\ntional scrutiny to those laws that burden a fundamental\nright or target a suspect class, such as those based on\nrace, national origin, sex or religion.  Romer, 517 U.S. at\n631.  To these groups of protected classifications, sub-\nject to a heightened scrutiny, the government is re-\nquired to demonstrate that the classification is substan-\ntially related to an important governmental objective.\nSee Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).  Laws that\ndo not burden a protected class or infringe on a constitu-\ntionally protected fundamental right are subject to ra-\ntional basis review.

In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 142 (W.D. Wash.\n2004).4 \n1. Level of Scrutiny. \nHere,  DOMA  makes  distinctions  between  legally\nmarried couples, by granting benefits to opposite-sex\nmarried couples but denying benefits to same-sex mar-\nried couples.  Accordingly, DOMA treats gay and lesbian\nindividuals differently on the basis of their sexual orien-\ntation.  In order to determine whether sexual orientation\nis considered a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled to\nheightened scrutiny, the Court must look at various fac-\ntors.5  The Supreme Court has considered:  (1) the his-\n4 Ms. Golinski challenges the application of DOMA because it dis-\ncriminates both on the basis of sex and on the basis of sexual orienta-\ntion. (Golinski Reply on Motion for Summary Judgment at 7-8.)  Sexual\norientation discrimination can take the form of sex discrimination.  See\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 996 (N.D. Cal. 2010)\n(“Perry”).  Here, for example, Ms. Golinski is prohibited from marrying\nMs. Cunninghis, a woman, because Ms. Golinski is a woman.  If Ms.\nGolinski were a man, DOMA would not serve to withhold benefits from\nher.  Thus, DOMA operates to restrict Ms. Golinski’s access to federal\nbenefits because of her sex.  But DOMA also operates to restrict Ms.\nGolinski’s access to federal benefits because of her sexual orientation;\nher desire to marry another woman arises only because she is a lesbian.\nAccordingly, the Court addresses the Equal Protection challenge on the\nbasis of sexual orientation.\n5 The question of whether DOMA impacts a fundamental right is ad-\ndressed briefly by the parties but it is not at issue here as it is undis-\nputed that Ms. Golinski is already married under state law.  The failure\nof the federal government to recognize Ms. Golinski’s marriage and to\nprovide benefits does not alter the fact that she is married under state\nlaw.  Thus, Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), which ostensibly ad-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 43 of 94\n19a\ntory of invidious discrimination against the class bur-\ndened by the legislation; (2) whether the characteristics\nthat distinguish the class indicate a typical class mem-\nber’s ability to contribute to society; (3) whether the\ndistinguishing characteristics are “immutable” or be-\nyond the class members’ control; and (4) the political\ndressed whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry,\nis irrelevant here.  See Perry v. Brown, — F.3d —, 2012 WL 372713 at,\n*17 n.14 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Perry II”). \nHowever, it is established that there is a fundamental right to marry.\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S.\n833, 851 (1992) (“Our law affords constitutional protection to personal\ndecisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family rela-\ntionships, child rearing, and education.  .  .  .  These matters, involving\nthe most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime,\nchoices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the\nliberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.”) (citations omitted);\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95 (1987) (“[T]he decision to marry is a\nfundamental right.”); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978)\n(“[T]he right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individu-\nals.”); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (“The freedom to marry\nhas long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to\nthe orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”); Griswold v. Connecti-\ncut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965) (“Marriage is a coming together for better\nor for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being\nsacred.  It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a\nharmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial\nor social projects.”).\nThe analysis of the fundamental right to marry has not depended up-\non the characteristics of the spouse.  The Supreme Court cases address-\ning the fundamental right to marry do not define the fundamental right\nin narrow terms.  In Loving, the Court defined the fundamental right\nas the right to marry, not the right to interracial marriage.  388 U.S. at\n12.  In Turner, the fundamental right was the right to marry, not the\nright to inmate marriage.  482 U.S. at 94-96.

See Varnum v. Brien, 763\nN.W.2d 862, 887-88 (Iowa 2009) (collecting cases). \nNo single factor for determining elevated scrutiny is\ndispositive.  See Massachusetts Board of Retirement v.\nMurgia, 427 U.S. 307, 321 (1976).  The presence of any\nof the factors is a signal that the particular classification\nis “more likely than others to reflect deep-seated preju-\ndice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some\nlegitimate objective,” thus requiring heightened scru-\ntiny.  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 n.14 (1982).  The\nSupreme Court has placed far greater weight on two\nfactors: \nwhether the group has been the subject of long-\nstanding and invidious discrimination and whether\nthe group’s distinguishing characteristic bears no\nrelation to the ability of the group members to per-\nform or function in society.  In circumstances in\nwhich a group has been subject to such discrimina-\ntion and its distinguishing characteristic does not\nbear any relation to such ability, the court inevitably\nhas employed heightened scrutiny in reviewing stat-\nutory classifications targeting those groups.\nKerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health, 289 Conn.\n135, 167-68 (2008). \n2. Distinguishing High Tech Gays Finding on Stan-\ndard of Review. \nBefore the Court may assess the various factors that\napply to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to\napply in this matter, the Court must address the holding\nin High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clear-\nance Office, which addresses the standard of review for\nclassifications based on sexual orientation.  895 F.2d 563,\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 45 of 94\n21a\n571 (9th Cir. 1990).  In High Tech Gays, decided before\nthe Supreme Court revised much of the underlying legal\npreconceptions upon which this case rests, the Ninth\nCircuit determined that the classification of homosexu-\nals lacks the indicia of a suspect or quasi-suspect cate-\ngory.  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held that the gov-\nernment need only come forth with a rational basis to\nsustain its classifications against the gay and lesbian\nminority.  Id. \nHowever, the foundations of the Ninth Circuit’s deci-\nsion in High Tech Gays have sustained serious erosion\nby  virtue  of  more  recent  decisions  by  the  Supreme\nCourt.  When the premise for a case’s holding has been\nweakened, the precedential import of the case is subject\nto question.  District courts are not governed by earlier\nappellate precedent that has been “undercut by higher\nauthority to such an extent that it has been effectively\noverruled by such higher authority.”  Miller v. Gammie,\n335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003). \nThe linchpin of the reasoning in High Tech Gays was\nthe precedent set by the Supreme Court in Bowers v.\nHardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 190 (1986), which upheld the\ncriminalization of private consensual homosexual con-\nduct.  In High Tech Gays, the Ninth Circuit concluded\nthat, based on the holding in Bowers, “because homosex-\nual conduct can  .  .  .  be criminalized, homosexuals can-\nnot constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class entitled\nto greater than rational basis review for equal protec-\ntion purposes.”  High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 571.  Pur-\nsuant to Supreme Court precedent in Bowers, the Ninth\nCircuit agreed that “it cannot logically be asserted that\ndiscrimination against homosexuals is constitutionally\ninfirm.”  Id. at 571 n.6 (quoting Woodward v. United\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 46 of 94\n22a\nStates, 871 F.2d 1068, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).  The court\nconcluded that, under the holding of Bowers, it would be\nanomalous to define the conduct of members of a class as\ncriminal and also find that, as a class, they were deserv-\ning of strict or heightened scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause.  See id. (citing Padula v. Webster,\n822 F.2d 97, 103 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). \nHowever, since the decision in High Tech Gays, the\nSupreme Court has overruled Bowers, renounced its\nfundamental premise, and found that “Bowers was not\ncorrect when it was decided, and it is not correct today.”\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003).  The Law-\nrence Court found that majority’s moral condemnation\nof the intimate practices of homosexual partners does\nnot justify criminal prohibition and found those private\nconsensual  practices  are  safeguarded  by  the  liberty\nprotections afforded by the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 574-75.  Therefore, the\nreasoning in High Tech Gays, that laws discriminating\nagainst gay men and lesbians are not entitled to height-\nened scrutiny because homosexual conduct may be legit-\nimately criminalized, cannot stand post-Lawrence. \nIn addition, the court in High Tech Gays, in perform-\ning the analysis of the issue of whether the legislature’s\nclassification based on homosexuality calls for height-\nened scrutiny, relied on the mistaken assumption that\nsexual orientation is merely “behavioral,” rather than\nthe sort of deeply rooted, immutable characteristic that\nwarrants  heightened  protection  from  discrimination.\nSee High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 573-74.  The court\nfound that “[h]omosexuality is not an immutable charac-\nteristic; it is behavioral and hence fundamentally differ-\nent from traits such as race, gender, or alienage, which\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 47 of 94\n23a\ndefine  already  existing  suspect  and  quasi-suspect\nclasses.  The behavior of such already recognized classes\nis irrelevant to their identification.”  Id. (internal cita-\ntions omitted).  The Supreme Court has since rejected\nthis artificial distinction, noting that its more recent\nprecedent “have declined to distinguish between status\nand conduct in th[e] context” of sexual orientation.  See\nChristian Legal Society v. Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971,\n2990 (2010).  In Lawrence, the Court noted that “[w]hen\nhomosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the\nState, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to\nsubject homosexual persons to discrimination.”  539 U.S.\nat 575 (emphasis added); id. at 583 (O’Connor, J., con-\ncurring in judgment) (“While it is true that the law ap-\nplies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is\nconduct that is closely correlated with being homosex-\nual.  Under such circumstances, [the] law is targeted at\nmore than conduct.  It is instead directed toward gay\npersons as a class.”).  Accordingly, the analysis of the\nNinth Circuit in High Tech Gays on the appropriateness\nof applying heightened scrutiny to gay men and lesbians\nbecause their defining characteristic is immutable has\nbeen severely undermined by more recent and overrid-\ning precedent. \nThe Court finds that the outdated holding in High\nTech Gays, subjecting gay men and lesbians to rational\nbasis  review,  is  no  longer  a  binding  precedent.  See\nMiller, 335 F.3d at 900 (finding that where an interven-\ning decision of a higher court is clearly irreconcilable\nwith a Ninth Circuit decision, “district courts should\nconsider themselves bound by the intervening higher\nauthority and reject the prior opinion of [the Ninth Cir-\ncuit] as having been effectively overruled.”). \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 48 of 94\n24a\n3. The Question of Level of Scrutiny is Still Open. \nThe Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have yet\nto issue binding rulings as to whether classifications\nbased  on  sexual  orientation  are  suspect  (or  quasi-\nsuspect).  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 620, 632-33 (finding\nthat it was unnecessary to look beyond rational basis\nreview because the state’s attempt to strip gay people of\nall anti-discrimination protections was “a denial of equal\nprotection in the most literal sense” and because it\n“confound[ed] and defie[d]” rational basis review.”); see\nalso, e.g., Diaz v. Brewer, 656 F.3d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir.\n2011) (“We do not need to decide whether heightened\nscrutiny might be required.”); In re Levenson, 587 F.3d\nat 931 (finding that although it is “likely that some form\nof heightened constitutional scrutiny applies  .  .  .\n[, because] the denial of benefits here cannot survive\neven rational basis review, the least searching form of\nconstitutional scrutiny  .  .  .  it is not necessary to deter-\nmine whether or which form of heightened scrutiny is\napplicable to this claim.”); Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at\n*17 (finding that, as in Romer, the court need not apply\nheightened scrutiny where the proposed legislation fails\nrational basis scrutiny); Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d at\n1189 (“Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs state a\nclaim under the rational basis standard, the question of\nwhether Plaintiffs are members of a protected class\nneed not be resolved here.”).  The majority of the Su-\npreme Court in Lawrence, although it declared unconsti-\ntutional the laws infringing on the substantive liberty\nshared by gay people to engage in sexual intimacy, did\nnot directly address what standard of review applies to\nthe classification of gay and lesbian individuals.  Law-\nrence, 539 U.S. at 558.  And the Ninth Circuit in Witt v.\nDepartment of Air Force merely found, in the context of\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 49 of 94\n25a\nmilitary policy where judicial deference “is at its apo-\ngee,” that the military’s policy of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell”\nwould fail even rational basis review.  527 F.3d 806, 821\n(9th Cir. 2008). \nBecause Lawrence overturned Bowers and in light of\nthe lack of precedential value of High Tech Gays, no\nfederal appellate court has meaningfully examined the\nappropriate level of scrutiny to apply to gay men and\nlesbians.  Therefore, the Court finds the question of\nwhat level of scrutiny applies to classifications based on\nsexual orientation is still open. \n4. Heightened Scrutiny Should Apply.\nThe Court undertakes to analyze the factors required\nto demonstrate whether a particular class is entitled to\nsuspect or quasi-suspect status and therefore deserving\nof heightened scrutiny. \na. History of discrimination against gay men\nand lesbians. \nThe first factor courts consider is whether the class\nhas suffered a history of discrimination.  There is no\ndispute in the record that lesbians and gay men have\nexperienced a long history of discrimination.  (See Dec-\nlaration of George Chauncey at ¶¶ 6-103; OPM Opp. Br.\nat 6-13.)  There is also no dispute that courts have found\nthat gay men and lesbians have experienced a history of\ndiscrimination.  See, e.g., High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at\n573 (acknowledging that “homosexuals have suffered a\nhistory of discrimination”); Witt, 527 F.3d at 824-25\n(noting that homosexuals have “experienced a history of\npurposeful unequal treatment”); Perry v. Proposition 8\nOfficial Proponents, 587 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir. 2009)\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 50 of 94\n26a\n(addressing the difficulty in denying that gay men and\nlesbians have experienced discrimination in the past in\nlight of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in High Tech Gays);\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 981-82 (acknowledging exten-\nsive  evidence  of  public  and  private  discrimination\nagainst gay men and lesbians in California and through-\nout the United States); see also In re Balas, 449 B.R.\n567, 576 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2011) (same). \nb. Ability to contribute to society. \nSimilarly, there is no dispute in the record or the law\nthat sexual orientation has no relevance to a person’s\nability to contribute to society.  See Watkins v. U.S.\nArmy, 875 F.2d 699, 725 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Sexual orien-\ntation plainly has no relevance to a person’s ability to\nperform or contribute to society.”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1002 (conclud-\ning that “by every available metric, opposite-sex couples\nare not better than their same-sex counterparts; in-\nstead, as partners, parents and citizens, opposite-sex\ncouples and same-sex couples are equal.”).  \nc. Defining or immutable characteristics. \nAnother consideration courts find relevant in deter-\nmining whether statutory provisions pertaining to a par-\nticular group are subject to heightened scrutiny includes\nwhether the characteristic that defines the members of\nthe class as a discrete group is immutable or otherwise\nnot within the members’ control.  See Lyng v. Castillo,\n477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986). \nMs. Golinski presents evidence that the characteris-\ntic of sexual orientation is immutable or highly resistant\nto change.  (See Declaration of Lisa Diamond at ¶¶ 10,\n13; Declaration of Letitia Anne Peplau at ¶¶ 21, 26; Rita\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 51 of 94\n27a\nLin Reply Declaration (“Lin Reply Decl.”), Ex. G.)  Fur-\nther, the consensus in the scientific community is that\nsexual orientation is an immutable characteristic.  See,\ne.g., G.M. Herek, et al. Demographic, Psychological,\nand Social Characteristics of Self-Identified Lesbian,\nGay, and Bisexual Adults, 7, 176-200 (2010) (noting that\nin a national survey, 95 percent of gay men and 83 per-\ncent of lesbian women reported that they experienced\n“no choice at all” or “very little choice” about their sex-\nual orientation); see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 966\n(“No credible evidence supports a finding that an indi-\nvidual may, through conscious decision, therapeutic in-\ntervention or any other method, change his or her sexual\norientation.”) \nBLAG presents evidence demonstrating that there is\nsome fluidity on the continuum of sexuality for some\nindividuals who identify themselves as gay or lesbian.\n(See Declaration of Conor B. Dugan (“Dugan Decl.”),\nEx. B at 36:14-38, Ex. 4, Ex. E at 320.)  The evidence\nindicates that a very small minority of the gay and les-\nbian population may experience a small amount of choice\nin their sexuality.  (Id.)  However, the vast majority of\nthose who self-reported as gay or lesbian did not experi-\nence attraction to the opposite sex at any time.  (See\nFurther Declaration of Letitia Anne Peplau at ¶ 6 (“data\nshow that only 1/2 of 1% of the male participants and\n1.3% of the female participants shifted from only oppo-\nsite sex attraction to major attraction to the same sex or\nvice versa.”)).  \nHowever, regardless of the evidence that a tiny per-\ncentage of gay men or lesbians may experience some\nflexibility along the continuum of their sexuality or the\nscientific consensus that sexual orientation is unchange-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 52 of 94\n28a\nable, the Court finds persuasive the holding in the Ninth\nCircuit that sexual orientation is recognized as a defin-\ning and immutable characteristic because it is so funda-\nmental to one’s identity.  “Sexual orientation and sexual\nidentity are immutable; they are so fundamental to one’s\nidentity that a person should not be required to abandon\nthem.”  Hernandez-Montiel v. Immigration and Natu-\nralization Service, 225 F.3d 1084, 1093 (9th Cir. 2000),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Thomas v. Gon-\nzales, 409 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Karouni v.\nGonzales, 399 F.3d 1163, 1173 (9th Cir. 2005) (agreeing\nwith Hernandez-Montiel and finding that homosexuality\nis “a fundamental aspect of  .  .  .  human identity”);\nWatkins, 875 F.2d at 726 (Norris, J., concurring) (find-\ning that the prong of suspectness inquiry is satisfied\nwhen the identifying trait is “so central to a person’s\nidentity that it would be abhorrent for government to\npenalize a person for refusing to change [it]”); In re\nMarriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757, 842 (2008) (“Because a\nperson’s sexual orientation is so integral an aspect of\none’s identity, it is not appropriate to require a person\nto repudiate or change his or her sexual orientation in\norder to avoid discriminatory treatment.”)  The Court\nfinds that a person’s sexual orientation is so fundamen-\ntal to one’s identity that a person should not be required\nto abandon it.  Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of\nthe application of heightened scrutiny.6\n6 In addition, immutability is not an absolute prerequisite to height-\nened scrutiny.  The Supreme Court has granted suspect class status to\ngroups whose distinguishing characteristic is not immutable.  See, e.g.,\nNyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9 n.11 (1977) (rejecting immutability re-\nquirements in treating group of resident aliens as suspect class despite\ntheir ability to opt out of class voluntarily); see also Miller v. Albright,\n523 U.S. 420, 431 (1998) (recognizing that because a child born out of\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 53 of 94\n29a\nd. Minority status and political powerlessness.\nThe final consideration employed by courts to deter-\nmine whether a subject group deserves heightened con-\nstitutional scrutiny is whether the subject group is “a\nminority or politically powerless.”  Bowen v. Gilliard,\n483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987); see also San Antonio Inde-\npendent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28\n(1973) (concluding that a class comprising poor families\nexhibits none of the “traditional indicia of suspectness”\nbecause class is not “saddled with such disabilities, or\nsubjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treat-\nment, or relegated to such a position of political power-\nlessness as to command extraordinary protection from\nthe majoritarian political process.”)  This factor exam-\nines relative political power and seeks to answer the\nquestion whether the “discrimination is unlikely to be\nsoon rectified by legislative means.”  City of Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 440.7 \nwedlock may be “legitimated” by father, strictly speaking illegitimacy\nis not an immutable characteristic); see also New Orleans v. Dukes, 427\nU.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam) (finding religious identification and\nalienage, despite being changeable, to constitute suspect classes). \n7 In High Tech Gays, the Ninth Circuit briefly addressed the factor\nof political powerlessness:  “legislatures have addressed and continue\nto address the discrimination suffered by homosexuals on account of\ntheir sexual orientation through the passage of anti-discrimination leg-\nislation.  Thus, homosexuals are not without political power; they have\nthe ability to and do ‘attract the attention of lawmakers,’ as evidenced\nby such legislation.”  895 F.2d at 574 (citing City of Cleburne, 473 U.S.\nat 445).  However, the very circumstance of gay men and lesbians being\nrequired to defend their interests against legislative action is a reflec-\ntion of relative political weakness.  (Declaration of Gary Segura (“Se-\ngura Decl.”) at ¶ 14.)  In addition, the standard is not whether a minor-\nity group is entirely powerless, but rather whether they suffer from\nrelative political weakness.  See Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 28; City of\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 54 of 94\n30a\nThere is no dispute in the record that gay men and\nlesbians are a minority of the population in the United\nStates.  (See Dugan Decl., Ex. A at 13:12-14, Ex. B at\n19:2-7.)  The only issue is whether the minority is politi-\ncally vulnerable or lacking in power.  The Court has re-\nviewed the evidence submitted by the parties for consid-\neration on this factor.  \nBLAG argues that the current Administration’s re-\nversal of position with regard to defending DOMA in\nvarious courts nationwide is evidence that gay and les-\nbian individuals have achieved political power.  BLAG\ncontends that the decision followed President Obama’s\nreceipt of a letter from the Human Rights Campaign\nseeking to change the Administration’s position.  (BLAG\nOpp. Br. at 12.)  However, this contention is not sup-\nported by the evidence in the record.  First, this letter\nwas sent nearly two years prior to the announcement of\nthe Administration’s current opinion.  (Lin Reply Decl.,\nEx. H at 166:16-167:13.)  Second, the Department of\nJustice functions under an independent obligation to\nassess  the  constitutionality  of  a  statute  it  has  been\ntasked to defend.  By its own terms, the announcement\nby the Department of Justice was based not on a politi-\ncal calculation, but rather was an independent assess-\nment of the constitutionality of DOMA.  (See NSA, Ex.\n1 at 1-2.)  The contention that a two-year-old letter from\na gay rights advocacy group was the pivotal consider-\nation in the Administration’s reassessment of the law or\nthat it demonstrates that gay men and lesbians have\npolitical power is speculative at best. \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 445. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 55 of 94\n31a\nBLAG also argues that a “spate of recent news sto-\nries only confirms the conclusion that homosexuals are\nfar from politically powerless.”  (BLAG Opp. Br. at 12.)\nBLAG lists the nomination of four openly-gay judges,\nthe laws in several states legalizing gay marriage, and\nthe campaign against Proposition 8 in California which\ngarnered  significant  funding  from  proponents  of\nsame-sex marriage.  (Id. at 12-15.) \nThe recent articles BLAG cites are exceptions and\nnot the rule.  While President Obama nominated four\nopenly-gay judges, there are literally hundreds of fed-\neral judges nationwide.  Only a handful of states have\nsuccessfully passed legislation legalizing same-sex mar-\nriage, and only a few more have been required to afford\nequal  marital  rights  to  gay  and  lesbian  individuals\nthrough judicial decisions.  Thirty states have passed\nconstitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage.\n(See OPM Opp. Br. at 15, citing National Conference of\nState Legislatures, Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions\nand Domestic Partnerships, available at http://www.\nncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid_16430 (last updated Febru-\nary 13, 2012)).  In contrast, when the Supreme Court\nruled  in  Loving,  interracial  marriage  was  legal  in\nthirty-four states.  See Loving, 388 U.S. at 6.  Moreover,\nthere is no federal anti-discrimination legislation and no\nprotection in most states from sexual orientation dis-\ncrimination.  (See OPM Opp. Br. at 6-12.)  Finally, while\nthe campaign against Proposition 8 may have raised sig-\nnificant funds, the majority of Californians still voted to\nalter the state constitution to strip gay and lesbian indi-\nviduals of their rights.  Placed in context, BLAG’s evi-\ndence does not create a question of fact. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 56 of 94\n32a\nDespite the modest successes in remediating existing\ndiscrimination, the record demonstrates that gay men\nand lesbians continue to suffer discrimination “unlikely\nto be rectified by legislative means.”  City of Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 440.  Even BLAG, in similar litigation, has\nadmitted that “gay men and lesbians often must rely on\njudicial decisions to secure equal rights.”  (Lin Reply\nDecl., Exs. C and D at ¶ 32.)  Ms. Golinski proffers the\nundisputed  and  extensive  expert  testimony  of  Gary\nSegura for the proposition that gay men and lesbians\nlack a meaningful degree of political power.  (See Segura\nDecl. at ¶¶ 9-85.)  In sum, the basic inability to bring\nabout an end to discrimination and pervasive prejudice,\nto secure desired policy outcomes and to prevent unde-\nsirable outcomes on fundamental matters that directly\nimpact their lives, is evidence of the relative political\npowerlessness of gay and lesbian individuals.  (Id. at\n¶ 28.) \nMs. Golinski also proffers the letter from the Attor-\nney General to Congress regarding DOMA and the De-\npartment of Justice’s determination that it would no\nlonger provide a defense of a statute which it considered\nto be unconstitutional.  (See NSA, Ex. 2.)  In the letter,\nthe Attorney General, speaking on behalf of the Execu-\ntive, notes that “the adoption of the laws like those at\nissue in Romer and Lawrence, the longstanding ban on\ngay men and lesbians in the military, and the absence of\nfederal protection for employment discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation show the group to have lim-\nited political power and ‘ability to attract the [favorable]\nattention of the lawmakers.’”  (Id. at 2, citing City of\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.) \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 57 of 94\n33a\nThe Court finds that the unequivocal evidence dem-\nonstrates that, although not completely politically pow-\nerless, the gay and lesbian community lacks meaningful\npolitical power.  In 1985, in their dissent from a petition\nfor writ of certiorari, Justices Brennan and Marshall\nfound that “homosexuals constitute a significant and\ninsular minority of this country’s population.  Because of\nthe immediate and severe opprobrium often manifested\nagainst homosexuals once so identified publicly, mem-\nbers of this group are particularly powerless to pursue\ntheir rights openly in the political arena.”  Rowland v.\nMad River Local School District, 470 U.S. 1009, 1014\n(1985).  The Court agrees and finds that, as a class, gay\nmen and lesbians are a minority and have relatively lim-\nited political power to attract the favorable attention of\nlawmakers.  See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.  Al-\nthough this factor is not an absolute prerequisite for\nheightened scrutiny, the Court finds the evidence and\nthe law support the conclusion that gay men and lesbi-\nans remain a politically vulnerable minority.  See Plyler,\n457 U.S. at 216 n.14; Murgia, 427 U.S. at 321. \nHere, having analyzed the factors, the Court holds\nthat the appropriate level of scrutiny to use when re-\nviewing statutory classifications based on sexual orien-\ntation is heightened scrutiny.  See also In re Levenson,\n587 F.3d at 931 (holding that “some form of heightened\nconstitutional  scrutiny  applies”);  Witt,  527  F.3d  at\n824-25 (Canby, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (“classifications against homosexuals are suspect\nin the equal protection sense” as gay and lesbian individ-\nuals have “experienced a history of purposeful unequal\ntreatment [and] been subjected to unique disabilities on\nthe basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly indica-\ntive of their abilities” and “they also exhibit obvious,\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 58 of 94\n34a\nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define\nthem as a discrete group; and they are a minority.”).  In\nshort, this Court holds that gay men and lesbians are a\ngroup deserving of heightened protection against the\nprejudices and power of an often-antagonistic majority.\nSee id. at 825. \n5. Application of Heightened Scrutiny to Justifica-\ntions Proffered for DOMA.\nUnder heightened scrutiny, the proponents of the\nstatute must establish, at a minimum, that the classifica-\ntion is “substantially related to an important govern-\nmental objective.”  Clark, 486 U.S. at 461.  Moreover,\nunder any form of heightened scrutiny, the statute may\nonly be defended by reference to the actual legislative\nbases advanced to legitimate the statute or the “actual\n[governmental] purpose, not rationalizations for actions\nin fact differently grounded.”  United States v. Virginia,\n518 U.S. 515, 535-36 (1996).  The Court notes that the\n“historical background of the decision” to enact legisla-\ntion and the “specific sequence of events leading up to\nthe challenged decision” may shed light on the decision-\nmakers’ purposes.  See Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n267 (1977).  Here, the legislative history is replete with\nexpressed animus toward gay men and lesbians. \nThe House Report on DOMA reflected Congress’\n“moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral con-\nviction that heterosexuality better comports with tradi-\ntional (especially Judeo-Christian) morality.”  H.R. Rep.\nNo. 104-664, at 16 (footnote omitted).  In his expression\nof these objectives, Henry Hyde, then-Chairman of the\nHouse Judiciary Committee, stated that “[m]ost people\ndo not approve of homosexual conduct  .  .  .  and they\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 59 of 94\n35a\nexpress  their  disapprobation  through  the  law.”  142\nCong. Rec. H7480 (daily ed. July 12, 1996). \nIn the floor debate, members of Congress repeatedly\nexpressed their disapprobation of homosexuality, calling\nit “immoral,” “depraved,” “unnatural,” “based on perver-\nsion,” and “an attack upon God’s principles.”  142 Cong.\nRec. H7444 (daily ed. July 11, 1996) (statement of Rep.\nCoburn); 142 Cong. Rec. H7486 (daily ed. July 12, 1996)\n(statement of Rep. Buyer); id. at H7494 (statement of\nRep. Smith).  Members of Congress argued that mar-\nriage by gay men and lesbians would “demean” and\n“trivialize” heterosexual marriage and might indeed be\n“the final blow to the American family.”  142 Cong. Rec.\nH7276  (daily  ed.  July  11,  1996)  (statement  of  Rep.\nLargent); 142 Cong. Rec. H7495 (daily ed. July 12, 1996)\n(statement of Rep. Lipinski) (“Allowing for gay mar-\nriages would be the final straw, it would devaluate the\nlove between a man and a woman and weaken us as a\nNation.”).  Senator Helms, in a statement prepared for\nthe hearing, expressed his disapprobation:  “[Those op-\nposed to DOMA] are demanding that homosexuality be\nconsidered as just another lifestyle—these are the peo-\nple who seek to force their agenda upon the vast major-\nity of Americans who reject the homosexual lifestyle\n.  .  .  Homosexuals and lesbians boast that they are close\nto realizing their goal—legitimizing their behavior  .  .  .\nAt the heart of this debate is the moral and spiritual\nsurvival of this Nation.”  142 Cong. Rec. S10,110 (daily\ned. Sept. 10, 1996); see also 142 Cong. Rec. H7275 (daily\ned. July 11, 1996) (statement of Rep. Barr) (stating that\nmarriage is “under direct assault by the homosexual\nextremists all across the country.”).  The House Report\non the pending DOMA bill stated:  “Civil laws that per-\nmit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a col-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 60 of 94\n36a\nlective moral judgment about human sexuality.  This\njudgment entails [a] moral disapproval of homosexual-\nity.”  H.R. Rep. 104-664, at 15-16.  The Report further\nstated that “same-sex marriage, if sanctified by the law,\nif approved by the law, legitimates a public union, a legal\nstatus that most people  .  .  .  feel ought to be illegiti-\nmate.”  Id. at 16. \nDespite the expressed animus against gay men and\nlesbians within the legislative history of DOMA, Con-\ngress also specifically identified four governmental in-\nterests to be advanced by the statute:  (1) encouraging\nresponsible procreation and child-rearing; (2) defending\nand nurturing the institution of traditional, heterosexual\nmarriage; (3) defending traditional notions of morality;\nand (4) preserving scarce government resources.  See\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 12-18. \na. Responsible procreation and child-rearing. \nThe first reason proffered by Congress when enact-\ning DOMA was to encourage responsible procreation\nand child-rearing. \nMs. Golinski presents evidence that it is “beyond\nscientific dispute” that same-sex parents are equally\ncapable at parenting as opposite-sex parents.  (See Dec-\nlaration of Michael Lamb (“Lamb Decl.”) at ¶ 14.)  The\nevidence presented by Professor Lamb demonstrates\nthat parents’ genders are irrelevant to children’s devel-\nopmental outcomes.  (See id. at ¶¶ 28, 38; Reply Decla-\nration of Michael Lamb (“Lamb Reply Decl.”) at ¶¶ 8,\n19, 28.)  More than thirty years of scholarship resulting\nin over fifty peer-reviewed empirical reports have over-\nwhelmingly demonstrated that children raised by same-\nsex parents are as likely to be emotionally healthy, and\neducationally and socially successful as those raised by\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 61 of 94\n37a\nopposite-sex parents.  (See Lamb Decl. at ¶¶ 29-32.)\n“There is  .  .  .  no empirical support for the notion that\nthe presence of both male and female role models in the\nhome promotes children’s adjustment or well-being.”\n(Id. at ¶ 14.)  “Since the enactment of DOMA, a consen-\nsus has developed among the medical, psychological and\nsocial welfare communities that children raised by gay\nand lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted\nas those raised by heterosexual parents.”  Gill, 699 F.\nSupp. 2d at 388; see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1000\n(“The evidence does not support a finding that Califor-\nnia has an interest in preferring opposite-sex parents\nover same-sex parents. Indeed, the evidence shows be-\nyond any doubt that parents’ genders are irrelevant to\nchildren’s  developmental  outcomes.”);  Varnum,  763\nN.W.2d at 899 n.26 (“The research appears to strongly\nsupport the conclusion that same-sex couples foster the\nsame wholesome environment as opposite-sex couples\nand suggests that the traditional notion that children\nneed a mother and a father to be raised into healthy,\nwell-adjusted adults is based more on stereotype than\nanything else.”). \nBLAG argues that there are flaws in the studies\nproffered by Ms. Golinski’s expert, Professor Lamb,\ncomparing gay or lesbian parents to opposite-sex par-\nents, based on methodological challenges.  The first al-\nleged flaw is that there have been fewer studies of gay\nmale parents than there have been of lesbian family re-\nsearch.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 7; see also Lin Re-\nply Decl., Ex. K at 76:6-17.)  Whether this is the case\ndoes not impact the validity of the studies performed.\n(See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 8.)  The second flaw as ar-\ngued by BLAG is that there are fewer studies on adoles-\ncents than on younger children.  However, it remains\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 62 of 94\n38a\nundisputed that “there are several  .  .  .  studies that\nhave looked at adolescent offspring living with same-sex\nparents” and those studies have “uniformly reported\npositive outcomes.”  (See id. at ¶¶ 9-10; see also Lin Re-\nply Decl., Ex. K at 82:15-83:21.)  The third criticism is\nthat Professor Lamb indicates the need for further stud-\nies.  This does not impact the validity of the studies al-\nready performed.  (See Lamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 12.)  The\nCourt finds that these criticisms of the studies relied\nupon by Professor Lamb do not alter their validity.\n“[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge’s function\nis not  .  .  .  to weigh the evidence and determine the\ntruth of the matter but to determine whether there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.”  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249.\nThe Court finds BLAG’s critique does not create an is-\nsue of fact. \nFurther, BLAG cites three sources for the proposi-\ntion that same-sex parenting is inferior to opposite-sex\nparenting.  One is an article from Slate.com in which the\nauthor contends that the existing science is methodologi-\ncally flawed and ideologically skewed.  (See Ann Hul-\nbert, The Gay Science:  What Do We Know About the\nEffects of Same-Sex Parenting?, Slate (Mar. 12, 2004),\navailable at http://www.slate.com/id/2097048/.)  This is\na three-page, non-scientific article by an author with no\nprofessional expertise in child development, published\nby a popular online magazine without peer review.  (See\nLamb Reply Decl. at ¶ 15.)  Another reference by BLAG\nis an article criticizing the sampling size in the studies\nrelied upon by Professor Lamb.  As Professor Lamb\nexplains, such sampling is typical of psychological re-\nsearch and a number of the studies he relied upon do use\nrepresentative sampling.  (See id. at ¶ 16.)  The last\nsource  is  an  unpublished  piece  by  Professor  Loren\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 63 of 94\n39a\nMarks in which he criticizes a brief issued by the Ameri-\ncan Psychological Association in 2005 concluding that\nsocial science research indicates that gay parents pro-\nvide a home environment equally likely to support chil-\ndren’s psychological and social growth.  (See BLAG Opp.\nBr., Ex. 2.)  The critique is neither a study nor published\nin a peer-reviewed journal and its questionable analysis\nis based on outdated and selectively-chosen data.  (See\nLamb Reply Decl. at ¶¶ 20-27.)  The piece also ignores\nmany of the studies relied upon by Professor Lamb re-\ngarding the conclusion that parents’ sexual orientation\nis unrelated to their children’s adjustment.  (See id. at\n¶¶ 21-27.)  Having reviewed the evidence presented, the\nCourt concludes that all three publications merely criti-\ncize the studies relied upon Professor Lamb.  As stated\nabove, the criticism merely goes to the weight of Ms.\nGolinski’s evidence.  The publications do not present any\nindependent affirmative evidence necessary to create a\ngenuine issue of disputed fact regarding whether same-\nsex married couples function as responsible parents. \nFurthermore, to the extent Congress was interested\nmerely  in  encouraging  responsible  procreation  and\nchild-rearing by opposite-sex married couples, a desire\nto encourage opposite-sex couples to procreate and raise\ntheir own children well would not provide a legitimate\nreason for denying federal recognition of same-sex mar-\nriages.  The denial of recognition and withholding of\nmarital benefits to same-sex couples does nothing to\nsupport  opposite-sex  parenting,  but  rather  merely\nserves to endanger children of same-sex parents by de-\nnying them “‘the immeasurable advantages that flow\nfrom the assurance of a stable family structure,’ when\nafforded equal recognition under federal law.”  Gill, 699\nF. Supp. 2d at 389 (quoting Goodridge v. Department of\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 64 of 94\n40a\nPublic Health, 440 Mass. 309, 335 (2003)).  It is undis-\nputed that same-sex parents can and do have and adopt\nchildren.    The  denial  of  federal  recognition  of  valid\nsame-sex marriages under state law does not alter pa-\nrental rights under state law.  Rather, the passage of\nDOMA only serves to undermine providing a stable en-\nvironment  for  children  of  same-sex  married  couples\nwhose children would otherwise be raised in a household\nbestowed with all of the federal benefits of marriage,\nincluding financial support and social recognition.  (See\nLamb Decl. at ¶ 42.) \nFurthermore, an interest in promoting procreation\nwithin marriage cannot provide a legitimate reason to\nexclude same-sex marriages from federal recognition.\nThe ability to procreate cannot and has never been a\nprecondition to marriage.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605\n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating “what justification could\nthere possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to\nhomosexual couples  .  .  .  [s]urely not the encourage-\nment of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are\nallowed to marry”).  “While it is certainly true that\nmany, perhaps most, married couples have children to-\ngether (assisted or unassisted), it is the exclusive and\npermanent commitment of the marriage partners to one\nanother, not the begetting of children, that is the sine\nqua non of civil marriage.”  Dragovich, 764 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1190 (citing Goodridge, 440 Mass. at 332).  The fed-\neral government has never considered withdrawing its\nrecognition of marriage based on an ability or inability\nto procreate.  See id.; see also Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at\n389.  Even if this could be considered a legitimate inter-\nest, denying federal recognition of and withholding fed-\neral benefits from legally married same-sex couples does\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 65 of 94\n41a\nnothing to encourage or discourage opposite-sex couples\nfrom having children within marriage.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the first proffered\nreason for the passage of DOMA—to encourage respon-\nsible procreation and child-rearing—does not provide a\njustification that is substantially related to an important\ngovernmental objective. \nb. Nurturing  the  institution  of  traditional,\nopposite-sex marriage. \nThe second reason proffered by Congress when pass-\ning DOMA, was its asserted interest in defending and\nnurturing traditional, opposite-sex marriage.  Tradition\nalone, however, cannot form an adequate justification\nfor a law.  See Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 239\n(1970); Romer, 517 U.S. at 635; Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n579.  The “ancient lineage” of a classification does not\nrender it legitimate.  Heller, 509 U.S. at 327.  Instead,\nthe government must have an interest separate and\napart from the fact of tradition itself.  \nIn addition, the ostensible governmental objective of\nfostering opposite-sex marriages remains unaffected by\nthe passage of DOMA.  DOMA does nothing to encour-\nage same-sex married individuals to marry members of\nthe opposite sex because they are already married to a\nmember of the same sex.  Nor does the denial of benefits\nto same-sex couples do anything to encourage oppo-\nsite-sex couples to get married.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp.\n2d at 389; see also In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at 932\n(“gays and lesbians will not be encouraged to enter into\nmarriages with members of the opposite sex by the gov-\nernment’s denial of benefits to same-sex spouses, and\nthe denial will not discourage same-sex couples from\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 66 of 94\n42a\nentering into same-sex marriages; so, the denial cannot\nbe said to ‘nurture’ or ‘defend’ the institution of hetero-\nsexual marriage.”); see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at\n972 (“Permitting same-sex couples to marry will not\naffect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry,\ndivorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage or\notherwise  affect  the  stability  of  opposite-sex  mar-\nriages.”). \nAccordingly, the Court does not find that the second\nproffered reason for the passage of DOMA—to defend\nand nurture the institution of traditional, opposite-sex\nmarriage—provides a justification that is substantially\nrelated to an important governmental objective. \nc. Defending traditional notions of morality. \nThe third reason proffered by Congress when pass-\ning DOMA was its asserted interest in defending tradi-\ntional notions of morality.  Basing legislation on moral\ndisapproval of same-sex couples does not pass any level\nof scrutiny.  “The animus toward, and moral rejection of,\nhomosexuality and same-sex relationships are apparent\nin the Congressional record.”  See Dragovich, 764 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1190.  “[M]oral condemnation of homosexu-\nality [does not] provide the requisite justification for the\nDOMA’s section three.  The ‘bare desire to harm a polit-\nically unpopular group’ is not a legitimate [governmen-\ntal] interest.”  Id. (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 634-35).\nThe condemnation of homosexuality as immoral \nhas been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of\nright and acceptable behavior, and respect for the\ntraditional family.  For many persons these are not\ntrivial concerns but profound and deep convictions\naccepted as ethical and moral principles to which\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 67 of 94\n43a\nthey aspire and which thus determine the course of\ntheir lives.  .  .  .  The issue is whether the majority\nmay use the power of the [government] to enforce\nthese views on the whole society through operation\nof the  .  .  .  law. \nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 571.  The Court concludes it can\nnot.  The imposition of subjective moral beliefs of a ma-\njority upon a minority cannot provide a justification for\nthe legislation.  The obligation of the Court is “to define\nthe liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.”\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 850.  “Moral disapproval of a group\ncannot be a legitimate governmental interest under the\nEqual Protection Clause because legal classifications\nmust not be ‘drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging\nthe group burdened by the law.’”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n582 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (quoting Romer, 517 U.S.\nat 633).  “[T]he fact that the governing majority  .  .  .\nhas traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral\nis not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting\nthe practice; neither history nor tradition could save a\nlaw prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional at-\ntack.”  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577-78. \nAccordingly, the Court does not find that the third\nproffered reason for the passage of DOMA—to defend\ntraditional notions of morality—provides a justification\nthat is substantially related to an important governmen-\ntal objective. \nd. Preserving scarce government resources. \nThe final reason proffered by Congress for passing\nDOMA was the preservation of scarce government re-\nsources.  However, there is no evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that the provision of federal benefits to\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 68 of 94\n44a\nsame-sex married couples would adversely affect the\ngovernment fisc.  In addition, the preservation of gov-\nernment resources cannot, as a matter of law, justify\nbarring some arbitrarily chosen group from a govern-\nment program.  Plyler, 457 at 227, 229.  “[A]lhough effi-\ncacious administration of governmental programs is not\nwithout some importance, ‘the Constitution recognizes\nhigher values than speed and efficiency.’”  Frontiero v.\nRichardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690 (1973) (citing Stanley v.\nIllinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656 (1972)).  Under heightened\nscrutiny, convenience and economic efficiency in the\nadministration of governmental programs do not legiti-\nmize differential treatment.  See id. at 690-91. \nAccordingly, the Court does not find that the fourth\nproffered reason for the passage of DOMA—to preserve\nscarce government resources—provides a justification\nthat is substantially related to an important governmen-\ntal objective. \nThe Court concludes that, based on the justifications\nproffered by Congress for its passage of DOMA, the\nstatute fails to satisfy heightened scrutiny and is uncon-\nstitutional as applied to Ms. Golinski. \nD. In the Alternative, DOMA Fails Under Rational\nBasis Review. \nAlthough the Court finds that DOMA is subject to\nand fails to satisfy heightened scrutiny, it notes that\nnumerous courts have found that the statute fails even\nrational basis review. \n1. Standards for Rational Basis Scrutiny. \nWhere a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor\ntargets a suspect class, a court shall uphold the legisla-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 69 of 94\n45a\ntive classification so long as it bears a rational relation\nto some legitimate end.  Heller, 509 U.S. at 319-320.\nUnder the rational basis standard of review, legislative\nenactments are accorded a strong presumption of valid-\nity.  Id.  Courts “are compelled under rational-basis re-\nview to accept a legislature’s generalizations even where\nthere is an imperfect fit between means and ends.”  Id.\n(internal citations omitted).  Indeed, a court applying\nrational basis review may “go so far as to hypothesize\nabout potential motivations of the legislature, in order\nto find a legitimate government interest sufficient to\njustify the challenged provision.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d\nat 387 (citing Shaw v. Oregon Public Employees’ Retire-\nment Board, 887 F.2d 947, 948-49 (9th Cir. 1989) (inter-\nnal quotation omitted)).  “In areas of social and economic\npolicy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds\nalong suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitu-\ntional rights must be upheld against equal protection\nchallenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of\nfacts that could provide a rational basis for the classifica-\ntion.”  FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S.\n307, 313 (1993). Rational basis review is “a paradigm of\njudicial restraint” and “is not a license for courts to\njudge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choic-\nes.”  Id. at 313-14.  “Nor does it authorize ‘the judiciary\n[to] sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or de-\nsirability of legislative policy determinations made in\nareas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed\nalong suspect lines.’”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 319 (quoting\nDukes, 427 U.S. at 303). \n“‘[T]he burden of establishing the unconstitutionality\nof a statute rests on him who assails it.’”  Baker v. Carr,\n369 U.S. 186, 266 (1962) (quoting Metropolitan Casualty\nIns. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 584 (1935)).  The bur-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 70 of 94\n46a\nden is to “‘negative every conceivable basis which might\nsupport it,’ whether or not the basis has a foundation in\nthe record.”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 320-21 (quoting Lehn-\nhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 364\n(1973)).  “A classification does not fail rational-basis re-\nview because it ‘is not made with mathematical nicety or\nbecause in practice it results in some inequality.’”  Id. at\n321 (quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485\n(1970)).  “The problems of government are practical\nones and may justify, if they do not require, rough ac-\ncommodations—illogical, it may be, and unscientific.”\nId. (citing Metropolis Theatre Co. v. City of Chicago, 228\nU.S. 61, 69-70 (1913)).  “A statutory discrimination will\nnot be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be\nconceived to justify it.”  Id. (citing McGowan v. Mary-\nland, 366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961)).  \nHowever,  rational  review  is  not  “toothless.”\nMathews v. de Castro, 429 U.S. 181, 185 (1976).  “A stat-\nutory classification fails rational-basis review only when\nit ‘rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement\nof the State’ s objective.’”  Heller, 509 U.S. at 324 (quot-\ning Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 71\n(1978)).  Rational basis review requires that the legisla-\ntion not be enacted for arbitrary or improper purposes.\nIn order for a law to be legitimate, it must be “properly\ncognizable” by the government asserting it and “rele-\nvant to interests” it “has the authority to implement.”\nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441.  The law must bear a\nlogical relationship to the purpose it purports to ad-\nvance.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33; see also Gill, 699\nF. Supp. 2d at 387.  “[E]ven in the ordinary equal pro-\ntection case calling for the most deferential of stan-\ndards, [courts] insist on knowing the relation between\nthe classification adopted and the object to be attained.”\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 71 of 94\n47a\nGill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 387 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at\n633).  Lastly, the justification for the law may not rely\non factual assumptions that exceed the bounds of ratio-\nnal speculation.  Lewis v. Thompson, 252 F.3d 567, 590\n(2d Cir. 2001) (citing Heller, 509 U.S. at 320 (holding\nthat speculation, while permissible, must be “rational”)). \nWhen applying rational basis review to a classifica-\ntion that adversely affects an unpopular group, courts\napply a “more searching” rational basis review.  Diaz,\n656 F.3d at 1012.  With these protections, courts may\nthereby “ensure that classifications are not drawn for\nthe purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by\nthe law.”  Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (citing Railroad Re-\ntirement  Board  v.  Fritz,  449  U.S.  166,  181  (1980)\n(Stevens, J., concurring) (“If the adverse impact on the\ndisfavored class is an apparent aim of the legislature, its\nimpartiality would be suspect.”)). \n2. Application of Rational Basis Review to Justifi-\ncations Proffered by Congress. \nThe Court has already addressed the four interests\nproffered by Congress during the passage of DOMA and\nfound them not to be substantially related to an impor-\ntant governmental objective.  Similarly, under the ratio-\nnal basis review, the Court finds that none of Congress’\nproffered justifications constitute a rational relation in\nfurtherance of some legitimate governmental end.  See\nRomer,  517  U.S.  at  631  (citing  Heller,  509  U.S.  at\n319-320). \nSpecifically, the Court finds that Congress’ justifica-\ntion of promoting traditional notions of morality does\nnot satisfy rational basis scrutiny.  See Lawrence, 539\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 72 of 94\n48a\nU.S. at 582 (holding that “[m]oral disapproval of [homo-\nsexuals], like a bare desire to harm the group, is an in-\nterest that is insufficient to satisfy rational basis review\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.”)  Also, if the denial\nof benefits is designed to defend traditional notions of\nmorality by discouraging same-sex marriage, “it does so\nonly by punishing same-sex couples who exercise their\nrights under state law, and thus exhibits the ‘bare desire\nto harm’ same-sex couples.”  In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\n932 (emphasis in original).  This is forbidden by the Con-\nstitution.  See Romer, 517 U.S. at 634-35.  “Discouraging\ngay marriage serves only to force gay couples to live in\na ‘state of sin’ rather than in a lawfully-recognized ‘state\nof connubial bliss’ that encourages a long-enduring per-\nmanent relationship that, in turn, serves as the basis of\na state-recognized family.”  In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\n932.  The promotion of morality is not a cognizable gov-\nernmental interest furthered by the denial of federal\nbenefits and protections. \nSimilarly, the Court does not find the justification of\npreserving the government fisc satisfies rational basis\nreview.  See Lyng v. International Union, 485 U.S. 360,\n376-77 (1988) (holding that previous cases make “clear\nthat something more than an invocation of the public fisc\nis necessary to demonstrate the rationality of selecting\n[one group], rather than some other group, to suffer the\nburden of cost-cutting legislation.”).  Ostensible savings\nto the government fisc that depends upon “distinguish-\ning between homosexual and heterosexual [couples],\nsimilarly situated,  .  .  .  cannot survive rational basis\nreview.”  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1014.8 \n8 During oral argument, counsel for BLAG argued that another\npossible justification for DOMA, somewhat related to protection of the\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 73 of 94\n49a\na. Responsible procreation and child-rearing. \nIn arguing its defense of DOMA, BLAG, for the most\npart, eschews the justifications proffered by Congress\nfor the legislation. However, the group does reiterate\nthe legislative justifications of encouraging responsible\nprocreation and child-rearing and the government’s in-\nterest in defending and nurturing the institution of tra-\nditional, heterosexual marriage. \nThe Court does not find the justification of encourag-\ning responsible procreation and child-rearing survives\nrational basis scrutiny.  Even if the Court were to accept\nas true, which it does not, that opposite-sex parenting is\nsomehow superior to same-sex parenting, DOMA is not\nrationally related to this alleged governmental interest.\nUnder rational basis review, although the fit between\nthe classification and the stated government interest\nneed not be perfect, the classification must be “narrow\nenough in scope and grounded in sufficient factual con-\ntext  .  .  .  to ascertain some relation between the classi-\nfication and the purpose it serve[s].”  Romer, 517 U.S. at\n632-33.  Rational basis review invalidates a measure\npublic fisc, is “to rationally maintain bargains that were decided upon\nby previous Congresses.  .  .  .  There were bargains made, and there\nwere calculus [sic] made in terms of  .  .  .  what benefits are we going to\ngive, what burdens are we going to put on people.”  (Transcript at 59.)\nThe decision of where and how to protect the government fisc and to\nprotect the bargains struck by previous Congresses does not independ-\nently constitute a rational basis upon which to differentiate among\nclasses of citizens.  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at 1014; see also Plyler, 457 U.S.\nat 227, 229 (holding that preservation of government resources cannot,\nas a matter of law, justify barring some arbitrarily chosen group from\na government program).  There must be some rational basis upon which\nto decide not to expend public resources for a particular group. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 74 of 94\n50a\nwhose “sheer breadth” is “discontinuous with the rea-\nsons offered for it.”  Id. at 632, 635 (rejecting justifica-\ntions where “[t]he breadth of the [measure] is so far re-\nmoved from these particular justifications that we find\nit impossible to credit them”); see also Eisenstadt v.\nBaird, 405 U.S. 438, 449 (1972) (rejecting justification of\nlaw discriminating between married and unmarried indi-\nviduals in access to contraceptives as “so riddled with\nexceptions” that the interest claimed by the government\n“cannot reasonably be regarded as its aim”).  \nDOMA has no effect on who may become a parent\nunder federal or state law.  Moreover, whether a same-\nsex couple is entitled to marriage benefits has no ratio-\nnal relation to that couple’s or an opposite-sex couple’s\nability to procreate.  Significantly, to reiterate, the abil-\nity to procreate has never been a precondition to mar-\nriage in any jurisdiction.  See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 605\n(Scalia, J. dissenting).9  Here, there is simply no connec-\ntion between the ability (or capacity) to become a parent\nand the designation of federal entitlements based on a\ndefinition of marriage that excludes legally married cou-\nples who are capable of becoming parents.\n9 During oral argument, counsel for BLAG argued that an additional\nreason for the passage of DOMA was the fact that opposite-sex married\ncouples could “have accidental pregnancies” or “can make babies spon-\ntaneously.”  (Transcript at 63-64.) BLAG did not, however, articulate\nhow the fact that opposite-sex couples can have accidental pregnancies\nconstitutes an interest supporting the passage of DOMA.  Although the\ngeneration of children may be biologically more spontaneous with\nopposite-sex couples, married or unmarried, the Court remains per-\nplexed how the uniformly deliberate decision of same-sex married\ncouples to become parents can be perceived as a justification against\nsupporting their procreation and child-rearing efforts. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 75 of 94\n51a\nDenying federal benefits to same-sex married cou-\nples has no rational effect on the procreation and child-\nrearing practices of opposite-sex married (or unmarried)\ncouples.  See Perry II, 2012, WL 372713, at *21 (“There\nis no rational reason to think that taking away the desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples would ad-\nvance the goal of encouraging  .  .  .  opposite-sex couples\nto procreate more responsibly.”)  To the extent some\npeople may have a bias in favor of preferring biological\nparents over other couples, there is no such recognition\nof this distinction under federal or state law.  See id.\nThere has been no showing that DOMA alters any state\nor federal law governing childbearing, procreation or\nfamily structure.  Given the state of the law, the ratio-\nnale of promoting responsible child-rearing finds no\n“‘footing in the realities of the subject addressed by the\nlegislation,’ and thus cannot be credited as rational.”\nPerry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *20 (citing Heller, 509 U.S.\nat 321). \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Congress’ stated\njustification of encouraging responsible procreation and\nchild-rearing bears no rational relationship to the classi-\nfication which burdens same-sex married couples. \nb. Nurturing  the  institution  of  traditional,\nopposite-sex marriage. \nBLAG contends that the institution of opposite-sex\nmarriage is deeply rooted in American law, embedded in\nhistory and tradition, and has been defined both by\nBlack’s Law Dictionary and the Bible.  (BLAG Motion to\nDismiss at 23-24, citing Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S.\n783, 792 (1983) (holding that traditional marriage “is\ndeeply embedded in the history and tradition of this\ncountry” and “has become part of the fabric of our soci-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 76 of 94\n52a\nety”) and Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 186 (Minn.\n1971) (holding that the “institution of marriage as a un-\nion of man and woman, uniquely involving the procre-\nation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as\nthe book of Genesis.”)). \nAgain, the argument that the definition of marriage\nshould remain the same for the definition’s sake is a cir-\ncular argument, not a rational justification.  Simply stat-\ning what has always been does not address the reasons\nfor it.  The mere fact that prior law, history, tradition,\nthe dictionary and the Bible have defined a term does\nnot give that definition a rational basis, it merely states\nwhat has been.  Tradition, standing alone, does not pro-\nvide a rational basis for the law.  Williams, 399 U.S. at\n239.  Simply, the “ancient lineage” of the law does not\nrender it rational.  See Heller, 509 U.S. at 327. \nBLAG argues, but does not explain how denying\nmarriage benefits only to same-sex couples will some-\nhow  make  marriage  between  opposite-sex  couples\nbetter.  The proffered justification may derive from\nstrongly-held religious or fundamentally traditional be-\nliefs, but still does not provide a legally recognizable\nrational basis for sustaining a law that actively discrimi-\nnates against legally married couples.  The exclusion of\nsame-sex couples from the federal definition of marriage\ndoes nothing to encourage or strengthen opposite-sex\nmarriages.  See Perry II, 2012 WL 372713, at *23 (hold-\ning that “the argument that withdrawing the designation\nof ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples could on its own\npromote the strength or stability of opposite-sex marital\nrelationships lacks any such footing in reality”); see also\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 972 (“Permitting same-sex\ncouples to marry will not affect the number of oppo-\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 77 of 94\n53a\nsite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have chil-\ndren outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability\nof opposite-sex marriages”); In re Levenson, 587 F.3d at\n932 (this governmental interest “is largely irrelevant to\nthe rational basis analysis here because the same-sex\ncouples  who  seek  the  benefits  are  already  married.\nAlso, gays and lesbians will not be encouraged to enter\ninto marriages with members of the opposite sex by the\ngovernment’s denial of benefits to same-sex spouses,\nand the denial will not discourage same-sex couples from\nentering into same-sex marriages; so the denial cannot\nbe said to ‘nurture’ or ‘defend’ the institution of hetero-\nsexual marriage.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Congress’ stated\njustification of nurturing the institution of traditional,\nopposite-sex marriage bears no rational relationship to\nthe classification which burdens same-sex married cou-\nples. \n3. Application of Rational Basis Review to Alter-\nnative Justifications Proffered by BLAG. \nBLAG does not rely exclusively on the stated legisla-\ntive justifications advanced by Congress during its pas-\nsage of DOMA.  A court may “hypothesize the motiva-\ntions of the  .  .  .  legislature to find a legitimate objec-\ntive promoted by the provision under attack.”  Shaw, 887\nF.2d at 948-49 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).  “[I]t is entirely irrelevant for constitutional\npurposes whether the conceived reason for the chal-\nlenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.”\nBeach Communications, 508 U.S. at 313.  In this regard,\nBLAG has proffered several additional hypothetical ra-\ntional bases for passing DOMA. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 78 of 94\n54a\na. Congressional caution in defining a legisla-\ntive term and maintaining the status quo. \nBLAG contends that Congress could have had a ra-\ntional basis for the passage of DOMA by preserving the\nstatus quo in the federal definition of marriage while\nwaiting for the states to “tinker with the substantive\ncenturies-old definition of marriage.”  (BLAG Opp. Br.\non Motion for Summary Judgment at 22.)  To the extent\nthis argument is premised upon preserving a traditional\ndefinition of marriage for its own sake, the Court has\nalready rejected this argument.  As the court found in\nGill, “[s]taying the course is not an end in and of itself,\nbut rather a means to an end.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at\n390-94.  The long history of discrimination against gay\nmen and lesbians does not provide a rational basis for\ncontinuing it. \nMoreover, DOMA does not preserve the status quo.\nThe passage of DOMA marks a stark departure from\ntradition and a blatant disregard of the well-accepted\nconcept of federalism in the area of domestic relations.\nSee Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392 (finding that DOMA\n“mark[ed] the first time the federal government has\never attempted to legislatively mandate a uniform fed-\neral definition of marriage—or any other core concept of\ndomestic relations, for that matter”); see also Drag-\novich,  764  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1189  (“[S]ection  three  of\nDOMA was a preemptive strike to bar federal legal rec-\nognition of same-sex marriages should certain states\ndecide to allow them, rather than a law that furthered\nthe status quo, which gave the states authority to define\nmarriage for themselves.”). \nThe status quo prior to the passage of DOMA was\nfederal recognition of the individual states’ authority to\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 79 of 94\n55a\ndefine marriage.  “The whole subject of the domestic\nrelations  .  .  .  belongs to the laws of the States and not\nto the laws of the United States.”  Elk Grove Unified\nSchool District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004) (cita-\ntion omitted); see also Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404\n(1975) (holding that “domestic relations” have “long\nbeen regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the\nStates” and “[t]he State  .  .  .  has absolute right” to reg-\nulate  marriage)  (citations  omitted);  Ankenbrandt  v.\nRichards, 504 U.S. 689, 703, 716 (1992) (“declarations of\nstatus, e.g., marriage, annulment, divorce, custody, and\npaternity,” lie at the “core” of domestic relations law\nreserved to the states) (Blackmun, J., concurring).  \nPrior to the enactment of DOMA, the federal govern-\nment had not attempted to craft its own federal defini-\ntion of marriage, “notwithstanding the occurrence of\nother similarly politically-charged, protracted, and fluid\ndebates at the state level as to who should be permitted\nto marry.”  Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392.  Congress ac-\ncepted without revision the patchwork of different state\nmarriage definitions regarding, for example, age re-\nquirements or marriage among related persons.  (See\ne.g., Declaration of Nancy Cott (“Cott Decl.”) at ¶¶ 26,\n51-52, 56-57.)  The federal government has continued\nto  defer  to  the  states  during  unprecedented,  hotly-\ncontested shifts in state marriage law, especially in the\narea of interracial marriage.  (Id. at ¶¶ 57.)  The strong\ntradition of federalism mandated that the federal gov-\nernment refrain from inserting itself in the business of\ndomestic relations.10\n10 BLAG contends that Congress has previously enacted laws which\ncreate unique federal definitions of marriage, for instance in the area\nfederal tax regulations, Social Security, immigration or federal benefits.\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 80 of 94\n56a\nThe Court finds that the passage of DOMA, rather\nthan maintaining the status quo in the arena of domestic\nrelations, stands in stark contrast to it.  Accordingly, the\nCourt finds that Congressional caution in defining a leg-\nislative term and maintaining the status quo does not\nconstitute a rational basis. \nb. Congressional caution in area of social divi-\nsiveness. \nBLAG also contends that Congress should remain\ncautious, especially in an area of so much social divisive-\nness, by holding the purported federal definition of mar-\nriage steady while waiting to see how the states tinker\nwith new definitions.  The Court finds the contention\nsimilar to arguments that were advanced in support of\nantimiscegenation laws.  Proponents similarly argued\nthat the long-standing tradition of the separation of the\nHowever, in each instance, the federal government accepted the state\ndefinitions of marriage and merely superimposed further requirements\nfor falling within the federal entitlement statute.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.\n§ 416 (requiring marriage of at least one year to obtain certain Social\nSecurity benefits); 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(b)(1) (discrediting marriages en-\ntered into merely to obtain immigration status).  These federal require-\nments do not purport to redefine or create a federal definition of marr-\niage, but rather impose additional criteria to further particular legis-\nlative goals.  \nIn addition, BLAG cites examples in which Congress legislated in the\narea of domestic relations, such as when it banned polygamy in the\nUtah Territory, when it promoted and supported marriages of former\nslaves after the Civil War, and legislation in the context of treatment of\nIndians tribes.  However, in each of those unique historical instances,\nCongress was acting in the role of the state in the absence of a secure\nstate government.  (See, e.g., Cott Decl. at ¶¶ 75-79.)  DOMA marks a\nradical departure from the tradition of federalism in the area of domes-\ntic relations.  See Gill, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 392. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 81 of 94\n57a\nraces provided justification for prohibiting interracial\nmarriage.  The lower court in Loving found that God had\ncreated the races and placed them on separate conti-\nnents in order that there “would be no cause for such\n[interracial] marriages.”  388 U.S. at 3.  It was, at the\ntime, a strongly-held belief among proponents of anti-\nmiscegenation laws that mixing the races was against\nGod’s will, flaunted a long history of tradition and, at its\ncore, endangered the institution of marriage.  See id.\nHowever, in its holding in Loving, the Supreme Court\nfound that although interracial marriage was a socially\ndivisive issue and proponents of antimiscegenation held\ntraditional and religious beliefs about the erosion of the\ntraditional concept of marriage, Virginia’s racial classifi-\ncation violated the equal protection guarantee.  Id. at\n11-12. \nMore recently, in Romer, the Supreme Court ad-\ndressed a proposed amendment to the Colorado state\nconstitution that would prohibit all legislative, executive,\nor  judicial  action  designed  to  protect  discrimination\nagainst homosexuals.  One of the arguments in support\nof the state amendment was that it was an attempt to\nwithdraw “a deeply divisive social and political issue\nfrom elected representatives and place its resolution\nsquarely in the hands of the people.”  (See Brief for Peti-\ntioner  filed  April  21,  1995  in  Romer  v.  Evans,  No.\n94-1039 (Supreme Court), 1995 WL 17008429, at *10) \nProponents contended that it was important to ensure\nthat “the deeply divisive issue of homosexuality does not\nserve to seriously fragment Colorado’s body politic.”\n(See id., at *47)  Proponents argued that it required\nsome leeway in this socially divisive atmosphere to han-\ndle the “sensitive and core political choices” in matters\nregarding discrimination against homosexuals calmly\n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 82 of 94\n58a\nover time.  (Id.)  The Supreme Court, however, flatly\nrejected this argument as providing a rational basis and\nfound that the proposed amendment to the Colorado\nstate constitution was unconstitutional.  Romer, 517 U.S.\nat 620. \nHere, too, this Court finds that Congress cannot, like\nan ostrich, merely bury its head in the sand and wait for\ndanger to pass, especially at the risk of permitting con-\ntinued constitutional injury upon legally married cou-\nples.  The fact that the issue is socially divisive does\nnothing to relieve the judiciary of its obligation to exam-\nine the constitutionality of the discriminating classifica-\ntions in the law. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Congressional cau-\ntion in the area of social divisiveness does not constitute\na rational basis. \nc. Consistency. \nBLAG also contends that Congress could have ratio-\nnally sought to base eligibility for federal benefits on a\ntraditional definition of marriage in order “to avoid the\narbitrariness and inconsistency in such eligibility  .  .  .\nand not depend[] on the vagaries of state law.”  (BLAG\nMotion to Dismiss at 24.)  However, as explained above,\nin all of the years preceding the passage of DOMA, Con-\ngress relied on the various states’ definitions of mar-\nriage without incident.  All couples married under state\nlaw were entitled to federal benefits, even if the particu-\nlars of the states’ definitions were variable.  The passage\nof DOMA actually undermined administrative consis-\ntency by requiring that the federal government, for the\nfirst time, discern which state definitions of marriage\nare entitled to federal recognition and which are not. \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 83 of 94\n59a\nAccordingly, the Court finds that consistency does\nnot constitute a rational basis. \nd. Any other possible basis. \nThe Court finds that neither Congress’ claimed legis-\nlative justifications nor any of the proposed reasons\nproffered by BLAG constitute bases rationally related\nto any of the alleged governmental interests.  Further,\nafter concluding that neither the law nor the record can\nsustain any of the interests suggested, the Court, having\ntried on its own, cannot conceive of any additional inter-\nests that DOMA might further.  See Diaz, 656 F.3d at\n1015. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court HEREBY DE-\nNIES BLAG’s motion to dismiss; DENIES as moot\nBLAG’s motion to strike; GRANTS Ms. Golinski’s mo-\ntion for summary judgment; and GRANTS the OPM’s\nmotion to dismiss. \nThe Court has found that DOMA unconstitutionally\ndiscriminates against same-sex married couples.  Even\nthough animus is clearly present in its legislative his-\ntory, the Court, having examined that history, the argu-\nments made in its support, and the effects of the law, is\npersuaded that something short of animus may have\nmotivated DOMA’s passage: \nPrejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not\nfrom malice or hostile animus alone.  It may result as\nwell  from  insensitivity  caused  by  simple  want  of\ncareful, rational reflection or from some instinctive\nmechanism to guard against people who appear to be\ndifferent in some respects from ourselves.  \n\nCase: 12-15409     07/03/2012     ID: 8236887     DktEntry: 77     Page: 84 of 94\n60a\nBoard of Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett,\n531 U.S. 356, 374-75 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \nThis case was presented by an employee of the judi-\ncial branch against the executive branch, which ulti-\nmately determined it could not legitimately support the\nlaw.    The  law  was  then  defended  by  the  legislative\nbranch.  The judicial branch is tasked with determining\nwhether this federal law is unconstitutional.  That is the\ncourts’ authority and responsibility.  “It is emphatically\nthe province and duty of the judicial department to say\nwhat the law is” and, where it is so, to declare legislation\nunconstitutional.  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 177 (1803).  As Supreme Court Chief Justice John\nG.  Roberts  said  during  his  confirmation  hearings:\n“Judges are like umpires.  Umpires don’t make the\nrules, they apply them.  .  .  .  it’s [the judge’s] job to call\nballs and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.”  Confirmation\nHearing on the Nomination of John G.

In this action, plaintiff Karen Golinski challenges federal discrimination against \n3\nher as a lesbian married to someone of the same sex, and the harm that such discrimination has \n4\ncaused her and her family.   \n5\n2.  Plaintiff is a citizen of the State of California and of the United States of America.  \n6\nShe is legally married to a person of the same sex in accordance with California law. \n7\n3.  The federal government does not license marriages, but many of its programs take \n8\nmarital status into account to determine eligibility for federal benefits, protections and \n9\nresponsibilities.  Statutes, precedent, and principles of federalism establish that state law is the \n10\ntouchstone for determining a couple’s marital status when establishing eligibility for federal \n11\nprograms. \n12\n13 4.  Plaintiff is an employee of the federal judiciary.  She receives health insurance \n14 through her employer and has elected a family health insurance plan to provide coverage to \n15 herself and to her son.  She requested that her employer enroll her spouse, Amy Cunninghis, in \n16 her family plan, a benefit available to married employees of the federal judiciary.  Defendants, on \n17 behalf of the federal government, however, refused and blocked the enrollment, based on \n18 plaintiff’s sexual orientation, and based on her sex in relation to the sex of her spouse. \n19 5.  As the basis for their denial of the benefits and protections of federal law, \n20 defendants invoked Section 3 of the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act,” P.L. 104-199, codified \n21 in part as 1 U.S.C. § 7 (“DOMA”), and stated that the federal government will only recognize \n22 marriages between a man and a woman.   \n23 6.  Defendants’ application of DOMA has barred plaintiff and her spouse from \n24 receiving benefits that are routinely granted to other similarly situated married couples, based on \n25 plaintiff’s sexual orientation and her sex in relation to the sex of her spouse.   \n26 7.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n27 §§ 2201-2202 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and for review of agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ \n28  701-706.  It seeks a determination that DOMA, 1 U.S.C. § 7, as applied to plaintiff, violates the \nUnited States Constitution by refusing to recognize lawful marriages for purposes of the laws \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  1\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page3 of 18\n1\n2 governing benefits for federal employees.  The result of these violations of the Constitution is that \n3 plaintiff has been denied, and will continue to be denied, legal protections and benefits under \n4 federal law that would be available to her if she were a heterosexual with a different-sex spouse. \n5 PARTIES \n6 8.  Plaintiff Karen Golinski is a California citizen residing in San Francisco, \n7 California.   \n8 9.  Defendant United States Office of Personnel Management is an independent \n9 establishment in the executive branch of the United States government.  5 U.S.C. § 1101.  \n10 10.  Defendant John Berry is the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \n11 Management. \n12 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY \n13 11.  This action arises under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the \n14 United States.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 8912; 28 U.S.C. \n15 § 1331; and 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2).   \n16 12.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).   \n17 13.  The United States has waived sovereign immunity under 5 U.S.C. § 702.   \n18 14.  Defendant John Berry’s actions in this matter were beyond the scope of his \n19 statutory and his constitutional authority.  Accordingly, sovereign immunity does not apply to this \n20 action. \n21\nFACTS \n22 15.  Karen Golinski and Amy Cunninghis have been partners for 21 years.  They met in \n23 the fall of 1989 and have been in a committed relationship ever since.  They became registered \n24 domestic partners with the City and County of San Francisco in 1995 and with the State of \n25 California in 2003.  They have an eight-year-old son whom they have raised from birth together.   \n26 16.  On May 15, 2008, the California Supreme Court ruled that the State’s laws that \n27 limited the institution of marriage to different-sex couples, while prohibiting same-sex couples \n28  from marrying, violated the California Constitution.  In re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757, 855-\n56 (2008).  On or about June 17, 2008, San Francisco and other California counties began to issue \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  2\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                                \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page4 of 18\n1\n2 marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  See Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 928 \n3 (N.D. Cal. 2010). \n4 17.  Ms. Golinski married Amy Cunninghis on August 21, 2008, at San Francisco City \n5 Hall, pursuant to a duly issued California marriage license.  Ms. Golinski and Ms. Cunninghis \n6 remain lawfully married under the laws of the State of California.   \n7 The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program\n8 18.  Ms. Golinski has been employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the \n9 Ninth Circuit, now located at 95 Seventh Street in San Francisco, California 94103, for \n10 approximately 19 years.  She is currently employed in the Motions Unit of the Office of Staff \n11 Attorneys.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit prohibits employment \n12 discrimination based on, among other things, sex or sexual orientation. \n13 19.  As an employee of the federal judiciary, Ms. Golinski obtains health insurance \n14 under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (“FEHB”).  See generally 5 U.S.C. § 8901 \n15 et seq.  Because she and her spouse have an eight-year-old son, Ms. Golinski has, since his birth, \n16 paid for “self and family” health insurance coverage under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield \n17 Service Benefit Plan (“Blue Cross/Blue Shield”). \n18 20.  The FEHB Handbook described Family Members Eligibility for Coverage as \n19 follows: \n20 Employing Office Responsibilities \n21 Your employing office is responsible for making decisions about \nwhether a family member is eligible for coverage. \n22\n*   *   * \n23\nGeneral Eligibility for Coverage \n24\nFamily members eligible for coverage under your Self and Family \n25 enrollment are your spouse (including a valid common law \nmarriage) and children under age 22, including legally adopted \n26\nchildren and recognized natural (born out of wedlock) children who \nmeet certain dependency requirements.  \n27\n*   *   * \n28 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  3\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page5 of 18\n1\n2 Eligible Family Members Automatically Covered \n3 When you enroll for Self and Family, you automatically include all \neligible members of your family.  If you don’t list an eligible family \n4 member on your Health Benefits Election Form (SF 2809) or other \nenrollment request, that person is still entitled to coverage.  If you \n5 list a person who is not an eligible family member, your employing \noffice will explain why the person is not eligible for coverage and \n6 will remove the name from the list.  The listing of an ineligible \nperson on the SF 2809 doesn’t entitle him/her to benefits. \n7\nFEHB Handbook (Oct. 28, 2008).   \n8\n21.  According to 5 U.S.C. § 8901(5), “member of family” is defined, in relevant part, \n9\nto “mean[] the spouse of an employee or annuitant [and] an unmarried dependent child under 22 \n10\nyears of age.” \n11\n22.  On September 2, 2008, Ms. Golinski sought to enroll her spouse in the family \n12\nhealth plan for which she was paying by submitting the appropriate forms to her employer’s \n13\nhuman resources department.  The human resources department forwarded the request to the \n14\nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts (“AO”).   \n15\n23.  On September 11, 2008, the AO advised the Ninth Circuit’s human resources \n16\ndepartment that Ms. Cunninghis was ineligible for coverage because Ms. Golinski and her spouse \n17\nare both women.   \n18\n24.  On October 21, 2008, the AO once again advised the Ninth Circuit’s human \n19\nresources department that Ms. Golinski’s election form would not be processed, and that Ms. \n20\nCunninghis was ineligible for coverage, for the same reason.  On both occasions, the AO \n21\nindicated that it based its actions on the “Defense of Marriage Act.”   \n22\n25.  If Ms. Golinski were a man, or conversely if Ms. Cunninghis were a man, \n23\nMs. Golinski would be able to add her spouse to her existing family plan at no additional cost to \n24\nher.  Similarly situated heterosexual employees in Ms. Golinski’s position routinely receive this \n25\nsignificant benefit as a matter of course.  For example, one employee who had recently joined the \n26\nMotions Unit under the same title and who, like Ms. Golinski, has a spouse and a young child, \n27\nattested that,  \n28 \nas soon as I began to work for the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit, I applied to have both my spouse and my \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  4\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                                \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page6 of 18\n1\n2 daughter covered under a family coverage health plan obtained \nthrough my employer.  I completed the “Health Benefits Election \n3 Form,” which stated that I wanted my wife and daughter to be \ncovered under the plan . . . .  Both my wife and daughter received \n4 coverage shortly thereafter.  \nMs. Golinski performs work equal to that of her co-workers, and in fact has more experience in \n5\nthe position than most, yet she does not receive the benefits that her married heterosexual co-\n6\nworkers receive for their respective spouses.   \n7\n26.  The government’s refusal to provide Ms. Golinski with benefits that similarly \n8\nsituated different-sex married couples receive burdens and stigmatizes her relationship.   \n9\n27.  Ms. Golinski has been forced to obtain separate, individual health insurance — \n10\nthat is, coverage outside of a group health plan — for her spouse that is inferior to the coverage \n11\nshe would receive under her plan.  In addition to payment of monthly premiums, Ms. Cunninghis \n12\n13 must also pay higher out-of-pocket costs for her health insurance than she would have to pay if \n14 she were covered under plaintiff’s employee group plan.  Ms. Cunninghis also receives less \n15 comprehensive coverage with her individual plan.  Ms. Cunninghis has been unable to obtain \n16 individual coverage of similar quality to that offered through Ms. Golinski’s employee health \n17 plan because no equivalent individual coverage is available for purchase on the market.  As a \n18 result, Ms. Golinski and her spouse have suffered, and continue to suffer, financial hardship and \n19 severe anxiety about the possibility that Ms. Cunninghis will be unable to obtain the care \n20 necessary to address serious health issues should they develop. \n21 The “Defense of Marriage Act”\n28.  Congress enacted the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act,” P.L. 104-199, in 1996, \n22\nand it was approved on September 21, 1996. \n23\n29.  Section 3 of DOMA, 1 U.S.C. § 7, provides, in part, as follows: \n24\n25 Sec. 3  DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE. \n26 (a)  IN GENERAL – Chapter 1 of title 1, United States Code is \namended by adding at the end the following: \n27\n§7.  Definition of ‘marriage’ and ‘spouse’  \n28 \n“In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of \nany ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  5\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page7 of 18\n1\n2 administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word \n‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one \n3 woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a \nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” \n4\n30.  This law responded to “a very particular development in the State of Hawaii.” \n5\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-664, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2905, at 2906.  As the controlling House \n6\nJudiciary Committee Report explained, “the state courts in Hawaii appear on the verge of \n7\nrequiring that State to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples,” and that development \n8\n“threatens to have very real consequences . . . on federal law . . . .” Id.  More specifically, \n9\n[I]f Hawaii does ultimately permit homosexuals to ‘marry,’ that \n10 development could have profound practical implications for federal \nlaw.  For to the extent that federal law has simply accepted state \n11 law determinations of who is married, a redefinition of marriage in \nHawaii to include homosexual couples could make such couples \n12 eligible for a whole range of federal rights and benefits. \n13 Id. at 2914. \n14 31.  In passing Section 3 of DOMA, Congress took the unprecedented step of \n15 preemptively nullifying a class of marriages that it expected states would begin to license at some \n16 point in the future, that is, marriages of same-sex couples.  It withdrew from these marriages, but \n17 not from others, all federal responsibilities, protections, and benefits, financial and otherwise. \n18 32.  With regard to a lesbian or gay individual married to someone of the same sex, \n19 Section 3 of DOMA has overridden the long-standing deference of federal law to state law in \n20 determining the marital status of an individual seeking the benefits or responsibilities of any \n21 federal law triggered by a person’s marital status, and it categorically denies both rights and \n22 responsibilities. \n23 33.  If not for the application of DOMA, Ms. Golinski, as a person legally married \n24 under California law, would receive the same benefits, responsibilities, and protections under \n25 federal law as other married persons.  Yet DOMA operates to single out one class of marriages \n26 legally recognized by the State of California, those of same-sex couples, and to deny their \n27 existence for all ends and purposes under federal law. \n28 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  6\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                                \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page8 of 18\n1\n2 34.  In a 1997 Report, the General Accounting Office (“GAO”)1 estimated that at least \n3 1,049 federal laws were affected by DOMA, because those laws depended on or in some way \n4 related to marital status.  U.S. Gov. Accountability Office, GAO/OGC-97-16 Defense of \n5 Marriage Act (1997), available at http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/og97016.pdf.  A follow-up \n6 study in 2004 found that 1,138 federal laws tied benefits, protections, or responsibilities to marital \n7 status.  U.S. Gov. Accountability Office, GAO-04-353R Defense of Marriage Act (2004), \n8 available at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf. \n9 35.  Ms. Golinski has been denied legal benefits and protections typically available to \n10 spouses under federal law.  Despite the willingness of Ms. Golinski and her spouse to assume the \n11 legally imposed responsibilities of marriage at the federal level, they are prevented from doing so \n12 by DOMA. \n13 36.  DOMA grants preferred legal status and unique privileges to individuals married \n14 to someone of a different sex. \n15 37.  The official House Report on DOMA, H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, advanced four \n16 rationales for why the federal government drew a line between its treatment of individuals \n17 married to a same-sex spouse and individuals married to a different-sex spouse: \n18 (1)  H.R. 3396 [the bill number] ADVANCES THE \nGOVERNMENT’S INTEREST IN DEFENDING AND \n19 NURTURING THE INSTITUTION OF TRADITIONAL \nHETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGE. \n20\n(2)  H.R. 3396 ADVANCES THE GOVERNMENT’S \n21\nINTEREST IN DEFENDING TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF \nMORALITY. \n22\n(3)  H.R. 3396 ADVANCES THE GOVERNMENT’S \n23\nINTEREST IN PROTECTING STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND \nDEMOCRATIC SELF GOVERNANCE. \n24\n(4)  H.R. 3396 ADVANCES THE GOVERNMENT’S \n25\nINTEREST IN PRESERVING SCARCE GOVERNMENT \nRESOURCES. \n26\n27\n                                                \n1 The General Accounting Office changed its name to the Government Accountability \n28  Office in 2004.  (See http://www.gao.gov/about/namechange.html.)  \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  7\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page9 of 18\n1\n2 38.  None of these interests is adequate to justify discrimination against married \n3 persons in same-sex relationships, and no other federal interest justifies such discrimination.   \n4 39.  The first claimed federal “interest” in “defending” “traditional heterosexual \n5 marriage” simply restates the government’s intent to discriminate against same-sex couples and \n6 provides no independent justification for the government’s discriminatory action.  The federal \n7 government has long accepted state determinations of marital status, even in the face of changes \n8 in marriage licensing by the states.  The only state-licensed marriages it categorically refuses to \n9 honor are those of same-sex couples.  The federal government’s refusal to recognize plaintiff’s \n10 marriage does not nurture, improve, stabilize, or enhance the marriages of other married couples.  \n11 Nor would the federal government’s recognition of plaintiff’s marriage degrade, destabilize, or \n12 have any other deleterious effect on the marriages of other married couples. \n13 40.  The second claimed federal interest in “morality” is another reframing of \n14 Congress’s disapproval of lesbians and gay men.  Lesbians and gay men have suffered a long \n15 history of public and private discrimination.  Discrimination for its own sake is not a legitimate \n16 purpose upon which disadvantageous classifications may be imposed.  Moreover, sexual \n17 orientation bears no relation whatsoever to an individual’s ability to participate in or contribute to \n18 society. \n19 41.  The third claimed interest in “protecting state sovereignty” is actually subverted by \n20 DOMA, not advanced by it.  In enacting DOMA, Congress violated inherent constitutional \n21 principles of federalism and failed to honor our nation’s system of dual sovereignty, because it is \n22 the states, and not the federal government, that regulate marriage and determine family status.  \n23 Congress did not “protect” state sovereignty in enacting DOMA, since it dishonored the \n24 sovereignty of the states that license or recognize marriages of same-sex couples. \n25 42.  As to the fourth claimed interest in preserving government resources, the available \n26 data from the Congressional Budget Office establishes that recognizing the marriages of \n27 individuals married to a person of the same sex would result in an annual net increase in federal \n28  revenue.  Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Congress, The Potential Budgetary Impact of \nRecognizing Same-Sex Marriages, June 21, 2004.  Furthermore, family health coverage for same-\nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  8\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                                \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page10 of 18\n1\n2 sex couples would provide countervailing advantages and cost savings for the government by \n3 reducing strain on social services and by strengthening the competitiveness of public employers.  \n4 There was and is no basis for the claim that DOMA “preserv[es] scarce government resources.”  \n5 43.  While the public fisc is always a matter of concern, the government cannot achieve \n6 this interest by singling out a similarly situated vulnerable minority group, such as lesbians and \n7 gay men, for discrimination based on their sexual orientation and sex in relation to the sex of their \n8 spouse.  There was and is no valid justification to deny lesbian and gay individuals who have met \n9 their obligations as taxpaying citizens and who are married to someone of the same sex the \n10 protections available to persons who are married to someone of a different sex.  \n11 44.  DOMA does not maintain the status quo or promote consistency.  It substantially \n12 altered the status quo with respect to the federal government’s treatment of marriage and \n13 provision of marriage-related benefits and created new inconsistencies in these arenas.   \n14 45.  Defendants’ categorical denial of equal compensation to plaintiff based on her \n15 sexual orientation and sex in relation to the sex of her spouse subjects defendants’ conduct to \n16 strict or at least heightened scrutiny.  Defendants’ conduct cannot withstand such scrutiny \n17 because defendants’ conduct does not serve any legitimate governmental interests, let alone any \n18 important or compelling governmental interests, nor does it serve any such interests in an \n19 adequately tailored manner. \n20 46.  At root, DOMA is motivated by disapproval of lesbians and gay men and their \n21 relationships, which is an illegitimate federal interest. \n22 Ninth Circuit EDR Review\n23 47.  In December 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \n24 adopted an Employment Dispute Resolution Plan (“EDR Plan”).  The EDR Plan was adopted at \n25 the direction, and with the approval, of the Judicial Conference of the United States.  The AO is \n26 subject to the “supervision and direction of the Judicial Conference of the United States.”  \n27 28 U.S.C. § 604.  As revised through December 2000, that EDR Plan prohibits employment \n28  discrimination based on, among other things, sex or sexual orientation.   \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  9\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                                \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page11 of 18\n1\n2 48.  Because the AO had informed Ms. Golinski that it would not enroll her spouse in \n3 her family plan, on October 2, 2008, Ms. Golinski timely and properly filed a complaint under the \n4 EDR Plan seeking redress of the discrimination she was suffering in the terms of her \n5 employment.  She alleged that:  (1) the denial of coverage violates the anti-discrimination \n6 provisions of the Ninth Circuit’s EDR Plan; (2) the FEHB and DOMA do not compel such \n7 discriminatory treatment, and under those statutes, she is entitled to coverage for her spouse; and \n8 (3) such treatment violates her rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States \n9 Constitution.  \n10 49.  As required by the EDR Plan, Ms. Golinski’s complaint was heard by the Chief \n11 Judge of the Ninth Circuit.  Following a hearing in November 2008, the Chief Judge issued a \n12 series of orders dated November 24, 2008, January 13, 2009, November 19, 2009, December 22, \n13 2009, and March 5, 2010.  The Chief Judge’s orders are attached hereto as Exhibits A-E, \n14 respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.    \n15 50.  By his orders dated November 24, 2008, and January 13, 2009, the Chief Judge \n16 ordered the Director of the AO to process Ms. Golinski’s health benefit election forms without \n17 regard to Ms. Golinski’s sexual orientation or the sex of her spouse.  The January 13 order \n18 explained that the AO had incorrectly concluded that DOMA prohibited the extension of family \n19 health insurance coverage to a same-sex spouse of a judicial employee.  (Exhibit B [January 13, \n20 2009 Order] at 2-7.) \n21 51.  The AO complied with the Chief Judge’s orders of November 24, 2008, and \n22 January 13, 2009, and submitted the appropriate enrollment papers to Ms. Golinski’s insurance \n23 carrier, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, to effectuate enrollment.   \n24 Defendants’ Unlawful Interference with the Provision of Benefits\n25 52.  Notwithstanding the final decision of Ms. Golinski’s employing office and agency \n26 that, under the pertinent federal laws, Ms. Golinski is entitled to enroll her spouse in her family \n27 plan, OPM intervened to prevent such enrollment.  On February 20, 2009, OPM sent a letter to \n28  AO stating, in part:  \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  10\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page12 of 18\n1\n2 As you are aware, Title 5, chapter 89 of the United States Code \ngoverns the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program.  \n3 It provides for coverage of the employee and members of the \nemployee’s family.  Members of the family are defined in the law, \n4 and include only certain unmarried dependent children and the \nspouse of the eligible employee or annuitant.  P.L. 104-199, the \n5 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) requires an agency when \ninterpreting an Act of Congress, to define the word “spouse” as a \n6 person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.  OPM issued \nguidance to agencies regarding the definitions of “marriage” and \n7 “spouse” in Benefits Administration Letter 96-111, dated \nNovember 15, 1996.  This Letter is available on the OPM web site \n8 at http://www.opm.gov/retire/pubs/bals and remains in effect.  \nOfficials of agencies participating in the Federal benefits programs \n9 administered by OPM must follow the guidance provided in the \nLetters. \n10\n(Exhibit C [November 19, 2009 Order], at Ex. A thereto.)    \n11\n53.  OPM’s February 20 letter further stated, \n12\nWe have advised Kaiser Foundation Health and the Blue Cross and \n13 Blue Shield Service Benefit Plans that they may not accept the \nenrollment forms submitted by your agency to provide coverage \n14 that is not allowed under Federal law. \n(Id.) \n15\n54.  As a result of OPM’s interference, the Chief Judge issued a further order on \n16\nNovember 19, 2009, “to protect Ms. Golinski and the integrity of the Judiciary’s EDR plans.”  \n17\n(Exhibit C at 3.)  The Chief Judge explained that, as to judicial employees, the separation of \n18\n19 powers doctrine requires that an EDR tribunal’s reasonable interpretations of the law take \n20 precedence over that of any office or agency of the executive.  (Exhibit C at 11-12.)  The Chief \n21 Judge expressly ordered OPM to remedy its prior, erroneous guidance to Blue Cross/Blue Shield \n22 blocking Ms. Cunninghis’s enrollment and to cease all prospective interference.  (Exhibit C at 15-\n23 16.)  The Chief Judge ordered the Clerk of the Court to serve the order on OPM (which it did), \n24 and he invited OPM to appeal.  (Id. at 16.)   \n25 55.  In that November 19, 2009 order, the Chief Judge also awarded Ms. Golinski \n26 ongoing back pay to reimburse her for the cost of purchasing separate individual insurance to \n27 cover Ms. Cunninghis.  As the Chief Judge found in that order, and in the subsequent March 5, \n28  2010 order calculating the precise amount of the back pay award, the back pay received by \nMs. Golinski is inadequate to remedy the discrimination that she suffers.  Because comparable \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  11\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page13 of 18\n1\n2 coverage is not available for purchase by individuals on the private market, Ms. Cunninghis’s \n3 coverage remains inferior, in terms of both the scope of its coverage and its higher out-of-pocket \n4 costs.  Moreover, as the Chief Judge observed, the award of back pay does nothing to alter Ms. \n5 Golinski’s consignment to a “de facto separate, and therefore inherently unequal, benefits system \n6 based on her sex and sexual orientation.” \n7 56.  OPM did not appeal the Chief Judge’s November 19, 2009 order, and it did not \n8 comply with the order.  Instead, it issued a press release stating, in part:  \n9 Karen Golinski, an employee of the Federal Courts, filed a \ngrievance against her employer claiming that the denial of \n10 enrollment of her same-sex spouse in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan (FEHBP) violated the Ninth Circuit’s Equal \n11 Employment Opportunity policy.  Ninth Circuit Chief Judge Alex \nKozinski, sitting in his administrative capacity, and not as a federal \n12 judge in a court case, said that employees of the court were entitled \nto FEHBP health benefits for their same-sex spouses.  OPM must \n13 administer the FEHBP in a lawful manner, and the Department of \nJustice (DOJ) has advised OPM that providing those benefits would \n14 violate the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act.” \n15 *   *   * \n16 In other words, the current federal law means that same-sex spouses \nare ineligible to be enrolled in federal benefit programs that define \n17 eligibility based on their status as spouses.  As the President has \nexplained, the Administration believes that this law is \n18 discriminatory and needs to be repealed by Congress — that is why \nPresident Obama has stated that he opposes DOMA and supports its \n19 legislative repeal. \n20\n*   *   * \n21\nThe decision in this matter was not reached lightly — after we \nlearned of this development, we examined our options and \n22\nconsulted with the DOJ.  DOJ advised us that the order issued by \nJudge Kozinski does not supersede our obligation to comply with \n23\nexisting law because it is not binding on OPM, as it was issued in \nhis administrative capacity, and not as a judge in a court case. \n24\n(Statement from Elaine Kaplan, OPM General Counsel, available at http://www. \n25\nwashingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/statement_from_elaine_kaplan_opm.pdf, attached \n26\nhereto as Exhibit F, and incorporated herein by reference.)  \n27\n57.  On December 22, 2009, the Chief Judge issued a final order holding that the time \n28 \nto appeal the prior orders had expired, finding that those prior orders are “therefore final and \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  12\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                                 \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page14 of 18\n1\n2 preclusive on all issues decided therein as to others who could have, but did not appeal, such as \n3 the [OPM],” and authorizing Ms. Golinski to take further action to enforce the prior orders.  \n4 (Exhibit D [December 22, 2009 Order] at 1.) \n5 58.  Defendants continue to block the provision of the spousal health insurance \n6 coverage to which Ms. Golinski is entitled. \n7 Procedural History\n8 59.  On January 20, 2010, Ms. Golinski filed the instant lawsuit, and she filed a First \n9 Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on March 8, 2010.  Therein she sought a writ of mandamus to \n10 direct OPM to comply with Chief Judge Kozinski’s orders and injunctive relief to compel OPM \n11 to rescind its prior guidance blocking Ms. Cunninghis’s enrollment, and to cease further \n12 interference.   \n13 60.  On February 23, 2011, the Attorney General of the United States announced in a \n14 letter to Congress that because Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional, and because \n15 classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, the Department of Justice \n16 will forego defense of the statute.  The Attorney General indicated, however, that “Section 3 will \n2 \n17 continue to be enforced by the Executive Branch.”\n18 61.  On March 16, 2011, the Court dismissed the FAC without prejudice, stating that \n19 “[t]he Court would, if it could, address the constitutionality” of “the legislative decision to enact \n20 Section 3 of DOMA to unfairly restrict benefits and privileges to state-sanctioned same-sex \n21 marriages . . . .  However, the Court is not able to reach these constitutional issues due to the \n22 unique procedural posture of this matter.”  (Dkt. No. 98 at 11.)  The Court granted Ms. Golinski \n23 leave to amend. \n24 62.  Ms. Golinski files this Second Amended Complaint to challenge defendants’ \n25 unlawful and unconstitutional action blocking coverage of her spouse on terms equal to those of \n26 employees with different-sex spouses. \n27                                                 \n2 Letter from the Attorney General to Congress on Litigation Involving the Defense of \n28  Marriage Act, available at http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-223.html. \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  13\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page15 of 18\n1\n2 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unlawful Agency Action and Withholding of Benefits) \n3\n63.  Plaintiff incorporates and realleges each and every allegation contained in \n4\nparagraphs 1 through 62 of this Complaint as if set forth fully herein. \n5\n64.  The FEHB program is a creature of federal statute, Chapter 89 of Title 5 of the \n6\nUnited States Code.  See 5 U.S.C. § 8901 et seq.  \n7\n65.  Pursuant to Congressional authority OPM prescribes regulations to carry out the \n8\nFEHB program and administers the program.  See 5 U.S.C. § 8913.  The pertinent regulations \n9\npromulgated by OPM are contained in Part 890 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.   \n10\n66.  The FEHB program extends to employees of the federal judiciary.  See generally \n11\n5 U.S.C. §§ 2105(a)(2), 8901(1)(A).   \n12\n13 67.  Under existing FEHB statutory and regulatory provisions, the spouse of a covered \n14 employee who has elected “Self and Family” coverage is entitled to enroll, and is automatically \n15 enrolled, in the employee’s health insurance plan under the FEHB program.   \n16 68.  FEHB provides that “[a] contract may not be made or a plan approved which \n17 excludes an individual because of race, sex, health status, or, at the time of the first opportunity to \n18 enroll, because of age.”  5 U.S.C. § 8902(f). \n19 69.  Under existing FEHB statutory and regulatory provisions, Ms. Cunninghis would \n20 be enrolled in Ms. Golinski’s “Self and Family” plan but for defendants’ application of DOMA, 1 \n21 U.S.C. § 7, which defendants maintain prevents provision of health insurance coverage to the \n22 spouse of an employee of the federal judiciary if that spouse is of the same sex as the employee.   \n23 70.  Defendants’ interference with the enrollment of plaintiff’s spouse and the resulting \n24 withholding of benefits, based on plaintiff’s sexual orientation and her sex in relation to the sex of \n25 her spouse, exceeds the authority delegated to defendants by Congress, contravenes the applicable \n26 laws governing FEHB, and violates plaintiff’s rights under the laws of the United States and the \n27 Constitution of the United States, including her rights to equal protection and due process secured \n28  by the Fifth Amendment. \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  14\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page16 of 18\n1\n2 71.  The disparity of treatment with regard to federal employment-related benefits \n3 available to Ms. Golinski and other similarly situated individuals is not mandated by DOMA, \n4 1 U.S.C. § 7, but rather reflects an improper and overly narrow construction of the permissible \n5 bounds of the federal government’s authority to extend coverage to family members.  Federal \n6 statutory provisions as to employment-related benefits that turn on “member of family,” “family,” \n7 or “family members,” including but not limited to 5 U.S.C. § 8901, set general guidelines and \n8 minimum requirements of coverage availability but do not establish absolute ceilings or outer \n9 boundaries of coverage.   \n10 72.  To the extent that the disparity of treatment with regard to federal employment-\n11 related benefits available to Ms. Golinski is, in fact, mandated by DOMA, 1 U.S.C. § 7, that \n12 disparity of treatment creates a classification that treats similarly situated individuals differently \n13 without adequate justification and improperly burdens and penalizes her relationship, based on \n14 her sexual orientation and her sex in relation to the sex of her spouse, in violation of the rights of \n15 equal protection and due process secured by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the \n16 United States.   \n17 73.  An actual controversy exists between and among the parties, and plaintiff has no \n18 other adequate remedy. \n19 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202) \n20\n21 74.  Plaintiff incorporates and realleges each and every allegation contained in \n22 paragraphs 1 through 73 of this Complaint as if set forth fully herein. \n23 75.  This case presents an actual case or controversy because there is an existing, \n24 ongoing, real, and substantial controversy between plaintiff and defendants, who have adverse \n25 interests.  This controversy is sufficiently immediate, substantial, and real to warrant the issuance \n26 of a declaratory judgment because plaintiff has been denied and will continue to be denied family \n27 coverage by defendants’ unlawful actions and enforcement of the unconstitutional law.  \n28  76.  This case is ripe for consideration because it presents issues suitable for an \nimmediate and definitive determination of the legal rights of the parties in this adversarial \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  15\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page17 of 18\n1\n2 proceeding, and plaintiff has been and will continue to be subjected to irreparable injury and \n3 significant hardship by defendants’ interference with the provision of family coverage for \n4 plaintiff’s spouse.   \n5 77.  Plaintiff’s claims are not speculative or hypothetical, but rather involve the validity \n6 of a statute that is being implemented and enforced by defendants against plaintiff and all other \n7 lesbian and gay federal employees who are legally married to persons of the same sex.  \n8 Defendants’ continued enforcement of the unconstitutional law will deprive plaintiff of family \n9 health coverage for her spouse, and will deprive plaintiff of the constitutional rights pleaded \n10 herein.   \n11 78.  The injury plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer if her rights are not \n12 adjudicated herein is real, immediate, actual, concrete, and particularized and is not just \n13 threatened but certain and ongoing.  No further events need take place to determine that \n14 defendants’ enforcement of Section 3 of DOMA has caused and will proximately cause plaintiff \n15 irreparable injuries. \n16 79.  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to protect her constitutional rights and to eliminate \n17 the resultant financial and emotional harms described above.  A decision enjoining defendants \n18 would redress and prevent further irreparable injuries from occurring to plaintiff.   \n19 80.  The irreparable injuries plaintiff has suffered and will suffer absent injunctive \n20 relief have no adequate remedy at law or in equity.  An injunction is the only way of adequately \n21 protecting plaintiff from the harms of the deprivation of her constitutional rights, the absence of \n22 family coverage to address her spouse’s ongoing health needs, and the financial burden of \n23 obtaining separate health coverage for her spouse.  No legal or equitable remedy short of an \n24 injunction can alleviate the stigma of the government’s failure to recognize plaintiff’s marital \n25 status with respect to family health insurance coverage.   \n26 81.  The burden on defendants of maintaining family coverage for plaintiff will be \n27 minor or non-existent.  Under its current contract with the insurer, the federal government would \n28  incur no additional cost by enrolling Ms. Cunninghis because it pays no additional money when \nan employee adds additional family members to a family health plan.  Further, there are only a \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  16\nCASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW \nsf-2973146  \n\n                               \nCase3:10-cv-00257-JSW   Document102   Filed04/14/11   Page18 of 18\n1\n2 small number of lesbian and gay federal employees who are legally married and who have sought \n3 to obtain family coverage for a spouse.  In contrast, the hardship to plaintiff of being deprived of \n4 insurance coverage for her spouse is significant, immediate, and ongoing.  The balance of \n5 hardships thus tips strongly in favor of plaintiff. \n6 PRAYER \n7 WHEREFORE, plaintiff Karen Golinski prays for relief as follows: \n8 a.  A declaration that Section 3 of DOMA, 1 U.S.C. § 7, is unconstitutional as applied to \n9 plaintiff  to prevent provision of health insurance coverage to her spouse; \n10 b.  A declaration that Ms. Golinski and her spouse are entitled to such coverage under the \n11 FEHB program; \n12 c.  A permanent injunction enjoining defendants, and those acting at their direction or on \n13 their behalf, from interfering with the enrollment of Ms. Golinski’s spouse in her family health \n14 insurance plan; \n15 d.  Costs incurred in maintaining this suit, including attorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to \n16 5 U.S.C. § 504 and 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and \n17 e.
