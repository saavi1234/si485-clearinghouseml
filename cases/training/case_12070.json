The Plaintiff class (all students who currently attend and/or will attend the Capital City Alternative School in the future), represented by attorneys from the SPLC and by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the Defendants' punishment methods were unconstitutional. Specifically, the Plaintiffs claimed that the Defendants would routinely shackle or handcuff students to railings and leave them unsupervised for up to six hours at a time as punishment for noncriminal violations of school policies. During these punishments, students were forced to eat their lunches while restrained, and had to beg school officials to let them use the restroom.</p><p>On April 12, 2012, the Parties presented a Settlement Agreement to the Court that was focused on overhauling the Defendants' disciplinary policies. Specifically, the Settlement Agreement banned the use of fixed restraints on all students, banned the use of handcuffs for punishment of noncriminal behavior and completely banned the use of handcuffs on any student under the age of 13. Additionally, the agreement required the Defendants to consult with experts to rework their disciplinary system, and to implement a system of record keeping and reporting of all instances in which restraints of any kind were used on students. Finally, the court appointed a monitor to follow the case for 24 months to ensure that the Defendants were in compliance with the agreement.</p><p>This Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court on May 25, 2012, and did not preclude any class member from bringing an individual damages claim against the Defendants.  </p><p>On July 17, 2015, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the case, indicating they had achieved compliance with the Settlement Agreement. On July 27, 2015, the court dismissed the case with prejudice. </p><p>The case is now closed.</p>",

The  Settlement Agreement is  fair,  reasonable,  and adequate and results from  serious, \ninformed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, does not improperly \ngrant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class, and falls \nwithin the range of possible relief. \n2.

The Settlement Agreement settles only claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and \nthe  Settlement  Agreement  will  not  preclude  any  class  member  from  bringing  an \nindividual damages claim against Defendants. \n5.

This civil rights action is filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983 to protect Jackson Public \nSchools students from Defendants' policy, custom and practice of inflicting unreasonable, abusive \nand excessive physical restraints on its students. Jackson Public School District (hereinafter \"JPS\" \nor \"Jackson Public  Schools\")  officials  subject  students to  brutal punishment that  consists  of \nshackling and handcuffing children to railings and leaving them unsupervised for up to six hours at \na time. Frequently, students are forced to eat their lunches while restrained and must beg JPS staff \n\nto  release them to use the restroom.  Children are forced to  endure this abusive and excessive \nrestraint  as  a consequence for perceived violations  of minor school rules - such as uniform \nviolations. \n2.  Plaintiff A.M. represents all school children who attend Capital City Alternative School in \nthe Jackson Public Schools and who are subject to Defendants' unconstitutional policies, customs, \nand practices of shackling children to railings, poles, chairs, bus seat legs, and other fixed objects \nfor long periods of time for violations of minor, non-criminal school rules. As a result of JPS \npolicy, Plaintiff A.M. has spent entire school days shackled to a railing because he left his belt at \nhorne or because he wore shoes that,  in the eyes of JPS  officials, were the wrong color.  The \nexperiences of A.M. are not isolated incidents. Numerous other children have spent their school \ndays handcuffed and shackled to poles because they failed to comply with the dress code or were \nalleged to have talked back to a teacher. These abuses result directly from Defendants' policy, \ncustom  and  practice  of routinely imprisoning  students  for  minor,  non-criminal  infractions  in \ncallous disregard for their rights and safety. \n3.  Plaintiff A.M., individually and on behalf of the Plaintiff class, which is composed of all \nstudents who now attend or who will in the future attend Capital City Alternative School, seeks \ndeclaratory, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring that the Defendants cease their \nunlawful policies, practices, and customs. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This cause of action arises under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution and 42 U.S. C. ยง 1983. Jurisdiction in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 1331 and 1343(a)(3). \n2 \n\n5.  Venue in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 (b), as a \"substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claim[ s] occurred\" in this district. \nPARTIES \nREPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFF \n6.  Plaintiff A.M. is sixteen years old and is  currently enrolled at Capital City Alternative \nSchool, a school operated by Jackson Public Schools. A.M. completed the 8th grade at Capital City \nAlternative School during the 2010-2011  school year,  and he will be required to  continue  at \nCapital City Alternative School at the start of the next school year. A.M. appears in this action by \nand through his mother, Jeannette Murry. At all times relevant to this complaint, he was enrolled in \nCapital City Alternative School. \nDEFENDANTS \n7.

Plaintiff A.M. brings this action on behalf of himself and all other students who now or in \nthe future will attend Capital City Alternative School, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(a) and (b)(2). \n15.  This action satisfies all four requirements of Rule 23(a): \na.  Numerosity:  This  class  is  so  numerous  that joinder of all  class  members  is \nimpracticable.  Capital  City  Alternative  School  has  a  student  population  of \napproximately  400-500  students  at  any  given  time.  Capital  City Alternative \n5 \n\nSchool is the only alternative school in the district that serves students in grades 4 \nthrough  12,  and  there  are  about 20,000  students  enrolled  in these  grades  in \nJackson Public Schools. Students who are sent to Capital City Alternative School \nenroll there for periods of time between ten days and a year or longer. Because of \nthe nature of the school as a short-term placement, students transfer in and out \nfrequently between Capital City and other schools in the district. The class also \nincludes students who will attend this school in the future whose identity cannot \nbe determined at the present time. Fed.R.Civ. P. 23(a)(l). \nb.  Commonality: There are questions of law and fact common to all members of the \nclass,  including,  but not limited  to,  the  unconstitutional  seizure policies  and \npractices  to  which  Defendants  routinely  subject  students  at  Capital  City \nAlternative School. Fed.R.Civ. P. 23(a)(2). \nc.  Typicality: The claims of the named Plaintiff are typical of those of the Plaintiff \nclass. As a result of the Defendants' policies and practices, students, including the \nnamed  Plaintiff  and  other  members  of  the  class,  are  unlawfully  seized, \nhandcuffed, and shackled to a pole or other fixed objects for very minor violations \nof school rules that do not justify this intrusion, which is patently unreasonable in \nscope. Fed.R.Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \nd.  Adequacy  of Representation:  The  named  Plaintiff will  fairly  and  adequately \nrepresent the interests of the class,  and has no interests in this matter that are \nantagonistic to the class members. This Plaintiff has a strong personal interest in \nthe subject matter of the lawsuit and is represented by experienced counsel with \nexpertise in civil rights and class action litigation. Fed.R.Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n6 \n\n16. Class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate tmder Rule 23(b)(2), because \nDefendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class in that Defendants' policies \nand practices of violating students' constitutional rights apply to the class as a whole. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n17. School safety officers at Capital City Alternative School routinely handcuff students to \nfixed objects for extended periods of time as punishment for non-criminal violations of school \nrules. School administrators, including Principal Harris and Assistant Principal Walden, frequently \ndirect the school  safety officers to  do  this  for  a  variety of infractions,  including dress  code \nviolations. \n18. Children as young as  nine years old are often taken to the school gym, where they are \nhandcuffed to  a stairway railing and left alone for hours  at a time. Youth, some with known \nmedical  and  mental health conditions,  are regularly shackled  and  left without supervision  or \nmonitoring, thus severely endangering their health and well being. \n19. Staff members  at  Capital  City  Alternative  School  treat  youth  in  a  demeaning  and \nexcessively punitive and harmful manner.  Staff members sometimes refuse to release children \nfrom these restraints to eat lunch or to use the bathroom. As a result, youth often must eat meals \nwhile still handcuffed to a pole or other fixed objects. Staff members routinely leave students in \nhandcuffs that are too tight, causing youth excessive pain and leaving visible marks and bruises on \ntheir wrists. Upon information and belief, other school employees passing by or through the gym \narea  can hear children calling out  and asking for the handcuffs to be loosened or to use the \nrestroom, without any response from safety officers or administrators. \n20. Staff members at Capital City Alternative School leave students shackled to a pole for \nhours as punishment for violations of school rules even though this is in clear contravention of \n7 \n\nBoard  policy  of Jackson  Public  Schools  School.  Board policy  states  that  physical  restraint, \nincluding handcuffs, could only be used if a student was \"an imminent danger\" to himself or others \nor destroying property, that restraint should immediately cease when \"compliance is met and the \nstudent  is  no  longer  a  danger  to  himself and/or  others,\"  and  that  \"[u]nder  absolutely  no \ncircumstances will restraint techniques be used as punishment.\" Jackson Public Schools, School \nBoard Policy JDHAB: Student Restraint Policy. \n21. Upon information and belief, administrators punish staff members who attempt to intervene \nin this inhumane treatment or to meet the basic human needs of these children. Staff members have \nbeen informally reprimanded for providing food for children who missed meals while they were in \nphysical restraints. \n22. This  type  of se1zure  1s  excessively  intrusive  and  unreasonably  subjects  youth  to  a \nsubstantial likelihood of emotional and physical injury. It is well documented that children who are \nsubjected to excessively intrusive seizures suffer injuries that can last a lifetime. According to a \nreport issued by national experts on the practice of using fixed restraints1 on youth, children who \nhave been subjected to restraints \"describe these events as punitive and aversive, leaving lingering \npsychological  scars.  Children  restrained ... report  recurrent  nightmares,  intrusive  thoughts, \navoidance  behaviors,  enhanced  startle  response ... even  years  after  the  event.  [These \npractices] ... may evoke feelings of guilt, humiliation, embarrassment, hopelessness, powerlessness, \nfear and panic.\" Sue Burrell, Moving Away From Hardware: The Juvenile Detention Alternatives \nInitiative  Standards  on  Fixed  Restraint  2  (Feb.  2009), \nhttp://www.jdaihelpdesk.org/Docs/Documents/MovingAwayFrom.Hardware.pdf  (quoting \nProtection and Advocacy, Inc., Restraint and Seclusion in California Schools: A Failing Grade 22-\n1 \"Fixed restraint\" refers to attaching a child's hands or feet to a fixed object, such as a piece of furniture. Sue \nBurrell, Moving Away from Hardware: The Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative on Fixed Restraint 1 (Feb. \n2009), http://www.jdaihelpdesk.org/Docs/Documents/MovingAwayFromHardware.pdf. \n8 \n\n23  (June  2007)).  After being  subjected to  this  practice,  youth,  including Plaintiff A.M.,  feel \nembarrassed and humiliated. Some children are left afraid to  go to school, out of fear of being \nsubjected to umeasonable and excessive restraint again. \n23. Fixed restraints are especially physically dangerous. Studies done in institutional settings \nhave  associated fixed  restraints with a number of deaths.  In 2000,  the United  States General \nAccounting Office found a variety of dangers such as \"restraint-related asphyxiation, strangulation, \ncardiac arrest, chocking and aspiration\" and concluded that \"children are at a higher risk of injuries \nor death when seclusion or restraint are used.\" Id.  at 2. In 2009, the General Accounting Office \nfound  a  number  of instances  in which  children  died  or  suffered  serious  injuries  after being \nsubjected to restraints in educational settings. United States General Accounting Office, Seclusions \nand Restraints: Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment \nCenters (2009). \n24. Despite the known dangers  of this unconstitutional practice,  custom and policy,  school \nofficials at Capital City Alternative School act with impunity. That this practice occurs is well \nknown amongst the staff at Capital City Alternative School and is candidly discussed between \nthem.  Administrators freely tell school safety officers to  take children \"to the rail'' in front  of \nstudents and other staff members. This happens so frequently and openly that parents visiting on \nother business during school hours have seen children sitting quietly while handcuffed to objects. \n25. On April15, 2011, attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center sent a letter detailing \nthe misuse of physical restraints at Capital City Alternative School to  a number of officials  at \nJackson Public Schools, including to the members of the School Board and to the Superintendent, \nand asking that this abuse be immediately stopped. On April 25, 2011, an attorney for Jackson \nPublic Schools informed Southern Poverty Law Center that it was \"investigating the allegations \n9 \n\ncontained in your letter\" and that the school  district had \"reminded its administrative staff at \nCapital City Alternative School to comply with the Board Policy\" on the use of restraints. Upon \ninformation and belief, the Jackson Public Schools School Board, Superintendent, and Director of \nSecurity have taken no action to address the misuse of restraints by their employees at Capital City \nAlternative  School,  and  youth  continue  to  be  subjected to  this  unlawful  policy,  custom  and \npractice. \nCapital City Alternative School \n26. Capital City Alternative School is a school within the Jackson Public Schools \"designed to \nserve as an alternative for students in grades 4-12 who have been suspended/expelled from Jackson \nPublic  Schools  for  10  days  or  longer.\"  Website  of  Capital  City  Alternative  School, \nhttp://ccas.jpsms.org (last visited May 5, 2011). \n27. The state legislature created alternative schools in Mississippi in the early 1990s in an \nattempt to ensure that \"students [will] continue to receive an education after disciplinary problems\" \nand to reduce the dropout rate among these students. In the Interest of TH, 681 So. 2d 110, 115 \n(Miss.  1996).  According to  the Mississippi Department of Education (MDE),  the mission  of \nalternative schools \"is to promote academic success, modify behavior, and facilitate employability \nand functional skills attainment. .. in an environment that differs from the traditional school setting \nand offers a more conducive setting to learning.\" Mississippi Department of Education, Office of \nCompulsory  School  Attendance  Enforcement,  Alternative  Education!GED  and  Counseling, \nAlternative Education  Guidebook 5  (2010).  These  schools  should,  \"[t]hrough  ongoing  direct \ninstruction, guidance, and monitoring,\" provide students with support \"with the goal of returning \nthe  student  to  a  comprehensive  school  environment  with the  necessary  abilities  to  function \ntherein.\" Id.  Capital City Alternative School describes its goal as being to provide \"an educational \n10 \n\nsetting appropriate to the needs of students\" by, for example, \"developing positive self-concepts \nthrough programmatic offerings, which provide a measure of success,\" \"address[ing] the social, \nemotional, and behavioral barriers that impede academic  success,\" and \"creat[ing] a climate where \nstudents feel  safe in the educational environment.\" Website of Capital City Alternative School, \nhttp://ccas.jpsms.org (last visited May 5, 2011). \n28. Since  the  establishment  of alternative  schools  in  the  state,  a number  of reports  and \nevaluations have  found  serious problems  with  alternative  schools  throughout Mississippi  and \nwithin Jackson Public Schools in particular. See American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Missing \nthe }vfark:  Alternative Schools  in  the State  of Mississippi  (2009);  Louis  Armstrong and Rims \nBarber, An Uneven Start: A Report on Alternative Education in Mississippi (1996). These concerns \nincluded: that minority children are disproportionately sent to  alternative schools; that students \n\\vho  are  \"unwanted\"  at  their regular schools were pushed  out to  the  alternative  schools;  that \nstudents are not receiving quality education services at these schools; that these schools fail to help \nstudents  return  to  mainstream  schools;  and  that  there  is  a  lack  of transparency  surrounding \nalternative schools. See ACLU, Missing the Mark, supra, at 17; Armstrong & Barber, An Uneven \nStart, supra,  at  1.  In 2009,  one independent report found  that in Jackson Public Schools,  the \nreferral rate to alternative school \"among African American students ( 5.9 per 10 00) was nearly six \ntimes that among white students (1.1 per 10 00).\" ACLU, Missing the Mark, supra, at 29. Youth in \nthe  school district were likely to  be sent to  the  alternative school for minor offenses,  not for \nengaging in dangerous behavior. Id.  at 48.  This report also  described \"Jackson's Capital  City \nAlternative School as having an especially punitive atmosphere,\" enforcing \"its zero  tolerance \npolicy 'to the utmost degree,\"' and using this policy \"to deliberately push out challenging and \n'undesirable' students.\" Id. at 43. \n11 \n\nExperiences ofI ndividual Students \nPlaintiff A.M. \n29. Plaintiff A.M. is a sixteen-year-old boy, who was enrolled in the 8th grade during the 2010-\n2011 school year, and who currently attends Capital City Alternative School. He has a history of \nasthma, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and seizures. During the first week of April, \n2011,  school  officials  repeatedly  handcuffed  Plaintiff A.M.  to  a  pole  and  left  him  there \nunsupervised for hours at a time. \n30. Every day, when students arrive at school, all students are required to go through a metal \ndetector and/or are subjected to a pat-down search by JPS school safety officers. Students have to \nremove their shoes. Their uniforms, including their belts and shoes, are also inspected. \n31.. On or about Friday, April 1, 2011, A.M. went to school without a belt. When he arrived at \nschool, A.M. vvas told to go to In-School Suspension for being in violation of the school dress \ncode. \n32. While A.M. was on his way to the In-School Suspension room, a school counselor tried to \ngive him a replacement belt to enable him to go to his regular classroom, but Assistant Principal \nWalden stopped the counselor and told her not to give A.M. a belt. Upset that he would not be able \nto go to  class, A.M. verbally protested to Assistant Principal Walden. A.M. was not physically \naggressive and did not threaten anyone. \n33. Assistant Principal Walden directed JPS School Safety Officer McKee to take A.M. to the \nschool gym and handcuff him there. \n34. School Safety Officer McKee took A.M. to a small area in the school gym, located next to \nthe stairs leading up to the stage, and handcuffed A.M. to the railing of the stairs. He placed one \ncuff onto A.M.'s wrist and secured the other cuff to the railing. \n12 \n\n35. The handcuffs were tight and hurt A.M.'s wrist. A.M. told School Safety Officer McKee, \nbut School Safety Officer McKee did not do anything to relieve the pain. \n36. A.M. was left alone, handcuffed to the railing, for the remainder of the school day. During \nthis time, A.M. was forced to be idle and was denied the opportunity to complete his schoolwork \nor gain any educational benefit. A.M. was isolated from his peers and school staff, though he was \nvisible to other students and staff and he suffered extreme humiliation and anguish because they \nsaw him handcuffed to a pole. \n3 7. When A.M. had to use the bathroom, he had to wait until he heard people nearby and call \nout to them to get their attention. On several occasions, School Safety Officer Greenwood heard \nhim and removed the handcuffs to  allow him to go the bathroom. After he used the bathroom, \ndespite the fact that A.M. was entirely compliant, School Safety Officer Greenwood replaced the \nhandcuffs and shackled A.M. to the same pole again. These short bathroom trips were the only \ntime A.M. was released from handcuffs. \n38. A.M. was not released from the handcuffs to eat lunch. Instead, a School Safety Officer \nbrought food to him to eat in the gym. A.M. was forced to eat his meal while still handcuffed to the \nrailing. \n39. A.M. was finally released from the handcuffs at the end of the school day, when the buses \ncame to take students home. A.M. was allowed to ride home on his regular school bus, along with \nthe other children. \n40. A.M. was subjected to  similar treatment three more times over the next week for minor \ninfractions, such as not wearing shoes allowed by the student dress code or not having on a belt. \n41. On each of these days, in the morning shortly after A.M. had arrived at school, School \nSafety Officer McKee took A.M. to the same place in the gym and handcuffed him to the pole, at \n13 \n\nthe direction of Assistant Principal Walden. A.M. was left there unsupervised for most or all of the \nschool day and was released from the handcuffs at the end of the day to ride the bus home. \n42. A.M.'s mother was not notified or called on any of these occasions, nor was she asked to \nbring him a belt or another pair of shoes. Upon information and belief, A.M. was not given a \ndisciplinary notice and did not have any infraction recorded in his  disciplinary record on these \noccasions. Upon information and belief, the police were not called and A.M. was not charged with \nany offenses as a result of these incidents. \n43. A.M. has been subjected to this treatment during previous school years as well. A.M. has \nbeen handcuffed to the pole in the gym at Capital City multiple times each school year since he \nwas in the fourth grade. \n44. On several of these past occasions in previous school years, Principal Harris directed the \nschool security personnel to handcuff A.M. to an object as punishment for minor misbehavior. \nA.M.  also  witnessed Principal Harris  directing JPS  school  security personnel  to  \"take  [other \nstudents] to the pole.\" \n45. This excessive use of restraints was not designed to reduce or curb misbehavior or prevent \nviolence by A.M. It was simply intended as degrading and vindictive punishment. At no point \nduring the entire initial contact or while he was restrained did A.M. pose a threat of bodily harm or \nengage in violent  conduct.  Indeed,  the  only  school  infractions  that he  was  alleged to  have \ncommitted were dress code violations and talking back. Handcuffing him and shackling him to a \npole for multiple hours on multiple days was unreasonable and unjustified both at inception and in \nscope. \n46. A.M. fears that school safety officers will again handcuff him to a pole and leave him there. \nIn addition to A.M. being subjected to this treatment, he has also seen other students handcuffed to \n14 \n\nthe same railing in the gym at different times. A.M. felt humiliated in front of his peers for being \nhandcuffed to a pole at school, and he dreads going to school each day, not knowing if they will \nhandcuff him. \n47. An objectively reasonable school administrator and school safety officer would know that \nhandcuffing a child, especially a child with known emotional and medical conditions, to a rail for \nhours over multiple days solely as punishment for minor misconduct is unlawful and unreasonable. \n48. The Defendants knew that this practice was unreasonable and against clear district written \npolicy which stated that physical restraint, including handcuffs, could only be used if a student was \n\"an  imminent  danger\"  to  himself  or  others  or  destroying  property,  that  restraint  should \nimmediately cease when \"compliance is met and the student is no longer a danger to himself \nand/or others,\" and that \"[u]nder absolutely no circumstances will restraint techniques be used as \npunishment.\" Jackson Public Schools, School Board Policy JDHAB: Student Restraint Policy. \n49. The Defendants knew that this practice was unreasonable and was  not permitted as  a \ndisciplinary  option  or  behavioral/intervention  strategy for  any  type  of misconduct under  the \ndistrict's authorized plan for student disciplinary action.  See Jackson Public Schools,  Code  of \nStudent Conduct, 2010-2011  16. The Defendants  also knew that the Code of Student Conduct \nspecified  the  authorized  types  of disciplinary  action  for  minor  misbehavior,  and  that  these \nauthorized  actions  included punishments  such  as  warnings,  parent conferences,  and in-school \nsuspension, but not shackling students to objects. Id. at 8. \n50. Even though this practice was not done pursuant to  a written policy of the JPS  School \nBoard, the practice of shackling students to poles and other fixed objects as punishment for minor \nmisbehavior is so widespread and persistent as to  constitute an official policy or custom of the \nschool  district.  JPS  school  administrators  and  security personnel have subjected  a number  of \n15 \n\nchildren to this practice frequently and over the course of multiple years. School administrators, \nincluding the principal and vice principal, often directly order that security guards shackle students \nto objects. In fact, the school administrators do this frequently enough that they have developed \nand utilize a short-hand vernacular to refer to the practice (\"take [the child] to the pole\"), which is \nunderstood clearly by the school security guards without any need for explanation. The practice is \nwidespread and persistent enough that other school personnel considered it commonplace, well \nsettled and ordinary; even though they frequently observe students shackled to the railing in the \ngym, they act as if this is permissible and do not intervene or report the occurrence. \n51. The experiences of Plaintiff A.M. are not isolated or anomalous incidents. Instead, they are \nrepresentative  of widespread  and  frequent  actions  by school  security officers,  at the explicit \ndirection or with the complicity of school administrators. In addition to Plaintiff A.M., countless \nother students enrolled at Capital City Alternative School have been victims of the challenged \npolicies  and  practices.  This  practice has  happened  so  frequently,  and  without  correction  or \nintervention by the school district, as to constitute a custom that fairly represents the policy of the \nschool district. \nN.R. \n52. N.R. is a fourteen-year-old boy who was enrolled in the 7th grade in Jackson Public Schools \nduring the  2010-2011  school  year.  N.R.  attended  Capital City Alternative School  for  several \nmonths during the 2010-2011  school year and attended that school at all times relevant to  the \nevents described below in Paragraphs 53 to 64. \n53. JPS safety officers and administrators at Capital City Alternative School have subjected \nN .R. to unreasonable and excessive handcuffmg on multiple occasions. \n16 \n\n54. In the winter or spring of 2011, N.R. was handcuffed to a pole in the school's gym for \nmultiple hours, with no supervision as a consequence for minor school rule violations. \n55. During his homeroom class at the start ofthe day, N.R.'s teacher confiscated a stocking cap \nfrom N.R. Upset, N.R. refused to do his schoolwork. The teacher called a school safety officer to \nthe room, and told the school safety officer that N.R. had a cap and was refusing to do his work. \n56. The school safety officer came into the classroom, grabbed N.R. and led N.R. out of the \nclassroom and into the hallway, where they encountered Principal Harris. Principal Harris directed \nthe school safety officer to \"lock [N.R.] to the pole.\" \n57. The school safety officer took N.R. to the gym and handcuffed N.R. to the railing on the \nstairs by the stage. The school safety officer secured one handcuff to N.R.'s wrist and the other \ncuff to the niling. The school safety officer told N.R. that he was handcuffed because N.R. had \ntruown his school papers on the ground. \n58. N.R.  \\Vas  left shackled to  the pole largely without supervision until the afternoon. N.R. \nslept for part of this time, yet was not released from the handcuffs. During the day, multiple school \nofficials  saw him handcuffed there but did nothing to  remove  the  handcuffs.  These included \nPrincipal Harris,  Assistant Principal Walden,  School Safety Officer Greenwood,  School Safety \nOfficer Rice, and School Safety Officer McKee. No one remained with N.R. to visually supervise \nN.R. while he was handcuffed and there were no video cameras in the area where N.R. was held. \n59. Because of the lack of supervision, when N.R.  had to  use the restroom while he was \nhandcuffed to the railing, he had to yell to get the attention of a school safety officer in order to ask \nto  be released  to  use  the  restroom.  However,  when  N.R.  asked  her,  School  Safety  Officer \nGreenwood did not release him and N.R. was not allowed to use the toilet. \n17 \n\n60. School  Safety Officer McKee brought N.R. his lunch while he was handcuffed to  the \nrailing, but did not release N.R. from the handcuffs. N.R. was forced to eat his lunch while still \nhandcuffed to the railing. \n61. When N.R. was finally released from the handcuffs in the afternoon, there were marks left \non his wrist. N.R. showed the marks to Assistant Principal Walden, but Assistant Principal Walden \ndid not get him medical attention or care. \n62.  After being released from the handcuffs, N.R. was allowed to go home. Upon information \nand belief, N.R. was not arrested or charged with any crime as a result of this incident. When he \nreturned to school, N.R. was given In-School Suspension. \n63. School officials have subjected N.R. to this excessive and unlawful use of restraints at least \nfive  times  during  this  school  year.  On prior  occasions,  School  Safety  Officers  McKee  and \nGreenwood have handcuffed him to the same railing and left him there alone. They told him in \nthese incidents that he was being handcuffed to the pole for non-criminal violations of school \nrules, including wearing shoes that were the \"wrong color,\" having mismatched shoelaces, or not \nbringing a parent feedback sheet. \n64. N.R. has seen a number of other youth handcuffed to a pole in the same manner that he \nwas, including Plaintiff A.M. \nR.S. \n65. R.S. is a fifteen-year-old girl who was emolled in the 8th grade in Jackson Public Schools \nduring the 2010-2011  school year.  R.S.  attended Capital City Alternative School for multiple \nmonths early in the 2010-2011 school year and at all times relevant to the events described below \nin Paragraphs 66 to 74. \n18 \n\n66. R.S. has been subjected to unreasonable and excessive handcuffing by JPS school safety \nofficers and administrators at Capital City Alternative School on multiple occasions. \n67. In January or February of2011, R.S. was unreasonably handcuffed without supervision to a \nstairway  railing  in  the  Capital  City  Alternative  School  gym  for  multiple  hours  for  minor \nmisbehavior. \n68. In the morning, R.S. loudly called out the name of a friend in the hallway, trying to get her \nfriend's attention. Campus Enforcement Officer Elijah Paige heard R.S. and told her to \"shut up.\" \nR.S.  talked back to  him,  saying \"who are you talking to?  I  ain't your child.\"  R.S.  was  not \nphysically aggressive and did not threaten anyone. \n69. In response to R.S. talking back, Campus Enforcement Officer Paige began leading R.S. to \nthe gym. On the way there, they encountered Principal Harris, who asked Campus Enforcement \nOfficer Paige where he was taking the student.  Campus Enforcement Officer Paige informed \nPrincipal Harris  that  he was  taking R.S.  \"to the stairway.\" Principal Harris  allowed Campus \nEnforcement Officer Paige to continue to the gym with R.S. \n70. Once in the gym, Campus Enforcement Officer Paige took R.S. to the small area next to the \nstage and handcuffed her to the rail on the stairway. He put a handcuff on one of her wrists and \nsecured the other handcuff to the rail. \n71. After  handcuffing  her,  Campus  Enforcement  Officer  Paige  left  R.S.  alone  without \nsupervision until lunchtime. During that time, R.S. was unable to get anyone's attention to ask to \nbe released to use the bathroom. While she was handcuffed to the rail, R.S. sat on the stairs and \nhad nothing to do. \n19 \n\n72. At lunchtime, Campus Enforcement Officer Paige released R.S. from the handcuffs. R.S. \nwas allowed to join the other students in the cafeteria and finish the school day in her normal \nclasses. \n73. At no point during this incident did R.S.  present a danger to herself or anyone else at \nCapital City Alternative  School.  This  restraint was both umeasonable  at  the time that it was \napplied and in its duration. Upon information and belief, R.S. was not given a disciplinary notice \nand  did  not  have  any  infraction recorded  in  her  disciplinary record  for  this  incident.  Upon \ninformation and belief, R.S. was not arrested or charged with any crime as a result of this incident. \nR.S.'s mother was never informed or contacted about this incident. \n74. R.S. has been subjected to this type ofumeasonable restraint two or three additional times \nduring the 2010-2011  school year, for similar incidents in which she was \"loud.\" R.S. has seen \nother students subjected to similar restraint in this manner for minor misbehavior multiple times. \nR.S. has witnessed school administrators swear at students, using language such as \"get your black \nass  [somewhere],\"  and  when students  respond using  similar language,  the  administrators  tell \nsecurity guards to take the students to the gym and handcuff them to the pole as punishment for \ncuss mg. \nM.D. \n75. M.D. is a 14-year-old boy who is currently enrolled in the gth grade in a school district \noutside of Mississippi. M.D. was enrolled in Jackson Public Schools during the 2009-2010 school \nand attended Capital City Alternative School for part of that school year and at all times relevant to \nthe events described below in Paragraphs 76 to 85. \n76. During the time that M.D. was attending Capital City Alternative School, school officials \nsubjected M.D. to unreasonable and excessive use of handcuffs and force. \n20 \n\n77. One day, in the spring semester of 2010, a security guard told M.D. to take off his shoes to \nbe searched at the start of a school day. M.D. did not want to do so and, upset, went to class. \n78. As punishment for refusing to take off his shoes, a school safety officer came to M.D.'s \nclassroom, dragged M.D. to  the gym by his belt, and shackled M.D. to  a pole by the staircase \nleading to the stage. The school safety officer put handcuffs on M.D.'s arm and leg and shackled \nthe handcuffs to the pole. M.D. told the school safety officer that the handcuffs were too tight and \nwere hurting him, but the school safety officer did nothing to loosen the handcuffs or to otherwise \nrelieve his pain. \n79. The school safety officer left M.D. alone and unsupervised while shackled to the pole for \nmore than an hour. During this time, a school official came by this area briefly one time. School \nofficials did not provide M.D. with school work while he was shackled to the pole. \n80. 'iiVbile M.D. was shackled to the pole, he had to go to the bathroom. Because no one was \nsupervising him while he was shackled, he was forced to yell to try to get the attention of a school \nsafety officer to  ask to  go to  the bathroom. Even though M.D.  yelled to  try to  get someone's \nattention, no one Cfulle to check on him and he was not allowed to go to the bathroom. \n81. A school official called M.D.'s mother and asked her to pick up her child. vVhen M.D.'s \nmother arrived at the school, Principal Harris told her that M.D. was in the gym, but did not allow \nM.D.'s mother to go get him from this location. \n82. More  than an  hour after M.D.  had been shackled to  the pole,  a school  safety officer \nreturned and told M.D.  that his mother had arrived to  pick him up.  The school  safety officer \nremoved the handcuffs from M.D. and walked with him to the office to meet his mother. \n83. Upon information and belief, M.D. was never arrested and no youth court charges were \nfiled against M.D. as a result of this incident. \n21 \n\n84. When his  mother  saw  M.D.,  she immediately observed that he had  new bruises  and \nscratches on his wrist that he did not have when he had gone to school that morning. M.D.'s \nmother asked Principal Harris what had happened. Principal Harris told M.D.'s mother that he \n\"had to be restrained\" and the school officials \"had to hold him down.\" Principal Harris did not tell \nM.D.'s mother that he was handcuffed. \n85. In frustration and anger after talking to Principal Harris, M.D.'s mother spoke with other \nsupport staff working in the Capital City administrative office, and asked how to complain about \nhow Principal Harris had treated her and her son. No one would provide her with this information. \nC.K. \n86. C.K. is a fifteen-year-old boy who was emolled in the 7th grade in Jackson Public Schools \nduring the 2010-2011  school  year.  C.K.  attended  Capital  City Alternative  School for  several \nmonths in the 201 0-2011  school year and at all times relevant to the events described below in \nParagraphs 87 to 95. \n87. C.K. has been subjected to unreasonable and excessive handcuffing by JPS security guards \nand administrators at Capital City Alternative School on multiple occasions. \n88. In the late winter or early spring of 2011, C.K. was unreasonably handcuffed to a stairway \nrailing in the gym for multiple hours for minor misbehavior, without any supervision. \n89. In  a class  early in the day,  C.K.  was dancing and rapping in his classroom.  Assistant \nPrincipal Walden came into the classroom and told C.K. to stop engaging in this behavior. C.K. \ncomplied with this directive and stopped. Assistant Principal Walden said to C.K., \"Boy, you look \nlike you got an attitude,\" and told him to go to the office. C.K. obeyed this command. \n90. At Assistant Principal Walden's direction, School Safety Officer Greenwood and another \nsecurity guard took C.K. from the office to the gym, where they handcuffed him to the railing next \n22 \n\nto the stage. C.K. told the guards that the handcuffs were tight and causing pain, and he asked for \nthem to be loosened, but the guards refused to do so. \n91. C.K.  was  left alone  in this  area without  supervision for  several hours before he was \nreleased from the handcuffs. \n92. After several hours, a security guard removed C.K. from the handcuffs and he was allowed \nto go horne with his mother. When the handcuffs were taken off, C.K. had visible marks on his \nwrist caused by the handcuffs. \n93. Upon information and belief, the police were not called and C.K.  was not arrested or \ncharged with any offense as a result of this incident. \n94. C.K. was subjected to this unreasonable restraint approximately five to six times during the \n2010-2011  school year, for similar minor misconduct.  On previous occasions, Principal Harris \ndirected a JPS school security guard to handcuff C.K. to the pole. \n95. C.K. has frequently witnessed many other children handcuffed in this manner for minor \nmisbehavior at Capital City Alternative School. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n96.

SPLC in the News \n..  Donate \n\"This settlement agreement is a \\Actory for the students of \nJackson Public Schools who haw been subjected to years of \nbrutal disciplinary policies,โข said Jody Owens, who leads the \nSPLC's Mississippi office. \n\"Jackson Public Schools officials at the highest lewis failed to protect students from a prison-like \nen\\Aronment, where children were subjected to regular shackling and chained to poles and railings for \nminor, non-criminal \\Aolations of school rules,\" Owens said. \"This handcuffing policy demonstrated a \npunitiw school culture and a broken model of school discipline that focused on criminalizing students at \nthe expense of educating them.\" \nThe agreement, approwd Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge Tom Lee, resolws a federal ci\\11 rights \nclass-action lawsuit the SPLC brought against Jackson Public Schools in June 2011 on behalf of \nstudents at Capital City Altematiw School (CCAS) who were shackled and handcuffed to railings and \npoles by JPS officials. These children were frequently left unsuper\\Ased for up to six hours at a time, \nforced to eat their lunches while restrained, and had to beg school staff to release them in order to use \nthe restroom. These abusiw and excessiw tactics were used as discipline for perceiwd \\Aolations of \nminor school rules, including dress code infractions. \nUnder the agreement, the school system must owrhaul discipline policies throughout the school district. \nThe specific reforms appro\\ed and ordered by the court include: \nโข  A written directiw from the district barring all Jackson Public Schools employees from using fixed \nrestraints on any JPS students. \nโข  A ban on the use of handcuffs on all students under the age of 13, and a ban on the use of \nhandcuffs as punishment for non-criminal beha\\Aor. \nโข  A school climate assessment of Capital City Altematiw School within 60 days, including student, \nparent and teacher satisfaction surwys. \nโข  The adoption of a Social Emotional Learning curriculum at CCAS designed to help students dewlap \nappropriate social skills and emotional regulation. \nโข  Training for all indi\\Aduals employed at CCAS on beha\\Aor management, wrbal de-escalation and \neffectiw communication. \nโข  The implementation of Positiw Beha\\Aorallnterwntions and Supports at CCAS, including the regular \nre\\Aew of discipline data and inter\\Aews with staff and students. \nโข  The formation of an owrsight council comprised of students, parents, child adwcates and a mental \nhealth professional to owrsee disciplinary reforms. \nwww.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/settlement-of-splc-suit-to-end-brutal-treatment-of-students  112 \n\n5130/12  Settlement of SPLC Suit to End Brutal Treatment of Students 1S  outhern Poverty Law Center \nThe settlement agreement also requires JPS to hire an independent expert to monitor the district's \ncompliance with the terms of the agreement. \nThe SPLC's education reform efforts in Mississippi include ad\\Ucacy to reform school discipline practices \nthat cause children to leaw school and that haw a disproportionate impact on students of color or with \nspecial needs. \nยฉ 2012.

R. Civ. P. 23(a). Each requirement is met here. First, Capital City Alternative School has a \nstudent population of approximately 400-500 students at any given time. Because of the nature \nof the school as a short-term placement, students transfer in and out frequently between Capital \nCity and other schools in the district. Given the large and fluctuating student population, the \nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members would be impracticable. The class also includes \nfuture, unknown members who cannot be joined. Second, this action involves questions of law \nand fact that are common to all class members. Third, because the challenged policies and \npractices apply with equal force to all class members, the claims of the named Plaintiff are \ntypical of the class. Finally, the named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent the interests \nof the class. The named Plaintiff has a personal interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit, and \nhis counsel is experienced in class action litigation and is prepared to pursue the case vigorously \non behalf of the class.  \n  Because the putative class satisfies every element of the Rule 23(a), and because the \nDefendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class as a whole, \nclass certification is proper under Rule 23(b)(2). \n  In support of this motion, Plaintiff relies upon the following documents: \nA.

In support of this Motion, the Parties state the following:  \n1)  On June 8, 2011, Plaintiff filed this civil rights action against the Jackson Public Schools \n(โJPSโ) Board of Trustees; Dr. Jayne Sargent, Interim Superintendent for JPS; Glenn \nDavis, Director of Security for JPS; Marie Harris, Principal of Capital City Alternative \nSchool (CCAS); Bobby Walden, Vice Principal of CCAS; Stacey Greenwood, a School \nSafety  Officer  at  CCAS;  and  Franklin  McKee,  a  School  Safety  Officer  at  CCAS, \nhereinafter collectively referred to as โthe Districtโ or โDefendants.โ  Plaintiff sought \ncertification of a class of all students who currently attend, or will in the future attend \nCCAS; and declaratory and injunctive relief to end Defendantsโ practice of handcuffing \nstudents to fixed objects at CCAS.  \n\nCase 3:11-cv-00344-TSL -MTP   Document 84    Filed 04/12/12   Page 2 of 5\n2)  On September 26, 2011, the Court issued an Initial Case Management Order (ECF No. \n26)  ordering  the  Parties  to  conduct  limited  discovery  for  the  purposes  of  class \ncertification  only.    The  Parties  each  conducted  three,  two-hour  depositions,  and \nexchanged numerous documents over the course of sixty (60) days.   \n3)  The Settlement Agreement was not reached lightly and results from five negotiation \nsessions between the Parties, two of which occurred before Judge Parker.  The Settlement \nAgreement  requires Defendants to end the practice of handcuffing  children to fixed \nobjects and to undertake a series of reforms to improve the climate at CCAS and ensure \ngreater  transparency  in  school  discipline  procedures  at  CCAS.    See  Settlement \nAgreement, attached as Exhibit A.  The Settlement Agreement is the product of serious, \ninformed,  non-collusive  negotiations,  has  no  obvious  deficiencies,  and  does  not \nimproperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class, \nand falls within the range of possible relief.   \n4)  The Settlement Agreement will spare the parties and the court from extensive litigation, \nand best serves the interests of the putative class.  \n5)  The  class  affected  by  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  comprised  of  all  students  who \ncurrently attend and/or will attend CCAS in the future.  Plaintiffโs counsel has agreed to \ndraft a written notice to current class members to explain the terms of the agreement, \nprovide them with an opportunity to advise Plaintiffโs counsel of any objections, and \nadvise current class members of the date of any fairness hearing scheduled by the Court \nso that class members may have the opportunity to offer testimony on the fairness of the \nSettlement Agreement. The Parties agree that the notice to current class members shall \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-00344-TSL -MTP   Document 84    Filed 04/12/12   Page 3 of 5\nspecifically  state  that  this  lawsuit  and  the  Settlement  Agreement  address,  settle  and \nresolve only claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n6)  It is the intent of the Parties that this Honorable Court will not dismiss this matter but will \nretain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the Settlement Agreement, and the Parties \nrespectfully request that an Order from this Court reflect the same.  \n7)  It is also the intent of the Parties that this Settlement Agreement settles only claims for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and that the Settlement Agreement will not preclude any \nclass  member  from  bringing  an  individual  damages  claim  against  Defendants.    The \nParties respectfully request that an Order from this Court reflect the same.  \n8)  For these reasons, the Parties respectfully request that the Court set this matter for a \nfairness hearing.  Pending approval of this Settlement Agreement at the fairness hearing, \nthe Parties respectfully request that the Court enter an Order 1) certifying the proposed \nsettlement  class;  2)  granting  approval  of  the  settlement  agreement;  and  3)  retaining \njurisdiction for enforcement purposes.  \n \nDate: April 12, 2012        Respectfully submitted,  \n \n            /s/ Vanessa J.
