Plaintiffs publish and distribute a monthly 56-page legal information magazine \nentitled \"Prison Legal News\" (PLN the magazine) dealing with the rights of incarcerated \nindividuals.  Each monthly issue of PLN the magazine provides updates on legal cases and court \ndecisions, as well as information about important legal issues such as access to courts and \ncounsel, disciplinary hearings, prison conditions, excessive force, mail censorship, jail litigation, \nvisitation, access to telephones; religious freedom, prison rape, and the death penalty, among \nother related topics.  PLN the magazine has been published continuously since 1990.  The \npublication is core protected speech, which is not objectionable on security or other grounds. \nPrison Legal News has approximately seven thousand (7,000) subscribers nationwide, including \nprisoners in local, state and federal correctional facilities, attorneys, judges and law libraries. \n15.  Plaintiffs also publish and distribute forty-four (44) soft-cover legal and self help \nbooks by other publishers, regarding the criminal justice system. These reading materials are \ndesigned to foster a better understanding of criminal justice policies and issues and to allow \nprisoners to educate themselves about basic related issues including legal research, how to write \na business letter, health care issues and similar topics.  Subscribers to PLN the magazine at \nOrleans Parish Prison were also sent a complimentary copy of the soft-cover book \"Protecting \nYour Health and Safety: Prisoners' Rights\", (hereafter \"Protecting Your Health and Safety\") \npublished by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), based in Montgomery, Alabama. \n6 \n\n16.  BegilUling on September 15,2010 and continuing to the present, thirty-five (35) \nindividual prisoners in custody of the defendants have become, at various times, subscribers to \nPLN the magazine. Plaintiffs have sent to each subscriber, monthly, a copy ofPLN the magazine, \npostage prepaid, via U.s. mail. These 35 subscribers have also been mailed a copy of the book \n\"Protecting Your Health and Safety\". \n17.  Defendant Sheriff Gusman has adopted a policy and practice, implemented by and \nthrough the defendants and other OPSO employees and staff, that impermissibly infringes upon \nplaintiffs rights to distribute its books and magazines to prisoners confined in the Orleans Parish \nPrison. \n18.  Defendant Sheriff Gusman's policy is made available to the public on his website, \nwww.opcso.or(!.  In the section entitled \"Inmate Mail and Visitation\" the policy states, under the \ncaption \"Other mail guidelines\" as follows: ''No books, magazines, newspapers or periodicals of \nany kind\". \n19.  Regarding magazines, newspapers and periodicals, Defendants' written policy is a \nflat ban on any of these materials being distributed to prisoners through the mail. The policy is \ncontained in the operations manual of the Orleans Parish Prison, Chapter: Inmate \nCommunication and Mail, Index#1401.2 and states as follows: \n\"II. Magazines, Newspapers and Periodicals: Inmates may not receive \nmagazines, newspapers, or any other periodicals through the mail.  These \nitems may be purchased through the inmate commissary\" \n20.  The only magazines on the inmate commissary list, titled the \"Orleans \nCommissary Menu\" are Newsweek and Essence. \n7 \n\n21.  Regarding books, Defendants' written policy, also contained in Index #1401.2, \nstates as follows: \n\"10. Books. Books may be accepted with the approval of the facility \nWarden.  If approved, the book must have a soft-cover and come directly \nfrom the publisher (books received from bookstores, or any other source, \nand hard-cover books will be refused and returned). The books are then \ndelivered to the facility Warden's Office. The context of the book must \nmeet the approval of the facility Warden or the book will be refused and \nreturned.  Ifbooks are found unacceptable the Warden will return them to \nthe Mail Room where they are documented in the return log book with the \nreason for refusal. the irunate name, and the inmate folder number.  The \nbooks are then returned to the sender.  It should also be noted that books \nare available for purchase through the inmate commissary.\" (Emphasis \nadded). \n22.  Defendants' policy totally prohibits soft-cover books mailed directly to prisoners \nfrom distributors such as plaintiffs, as well as bookstores. In addition, it delegates to each warden \nof the various facilities the unbridled discretion to censor and exclude soft-cover books, even \nthose sent directly from the publisher, without providing any guidelines, standards or criteria for \ndetermining what is acceptable or \"unacceptable\". There are also no requirements to provide \nnotice to the sender of the book of the reasons for censorship and exclusion or the opportunity to \nbe heard and procedures for review of the decision.  Furthermore, there are no time limits within \nwhich the various wardens must make a decision regarding whether a book is acceptable or \n8 \n\n\"unacceptable.\" \n23.  The only books on the inmate commissary list are the Bible, the Koran, a \ndictionary and a listing often (10) \"Best Sellers, titles and authors unstated, which are identified \non the commissary list, sequentially, as \"Best Seller I \", \"Best Seller 2\", etc.  On information and \nbelief, the actual titles change periodically, though virtually all of the titles appear to be what is \nknown as mass-market popular fiction with titles such as \"Swimsuit\", \"Sizzle\", \"Miss Liz's \nPassion/Home on the Ranch\", \"Big Girl: A Novel\", etc.  Books from genres such as serious \nclassical and contemporary literature, poetry, history, science, philosophy, politics, theater, \ncriminal justice, self-help, etc. are not included on the \"Best Seller\" Nos. 1-10 commissary list. A \nsoft-cover copy of Dante's Inferno, which is not on the \"commissary menu\" at the jail, was sent \nvia U.S. mail in Oct., 2011 by a 10caJ New Orleans bookstore to an OPP prisoner, which resulted \nin the boofbeing censored and excluded by defendants and returned, stamped \"Return to \nSender\", with no further information provided. \n24.  Under the defendants' written policies there is no requirement for \"prior approval\" \nby facility wardens for magazines. There is also no procedure for publishers or distributors to \nmail magazine subscriptions to individual subscribers in defendants' custody. Only those \nmagazines which are on the inmate commissary list, Newsweek and Essence, are permitted. \n25.  PLN the magazine and the soft-cover books distributed by plaintiffs are not on the \nOrleans Parish Sheriff's Office inmate commissary list (the \"commissary menu\") and therefore \ncannot be ordered by prisoners in the custody of defendants through the jail commissary. \n26.  Index #1401.1, \"Irunate Access to Policies and Procedures-Mail\" aJso states that \nduring intake prisoners are to be provided with an \"lrunate Orientation Form which includes \n9 \n\nrules governing the handling ofinrnate mail.\"  The lrunate Orientation Form provided to Opp \nprisoners has no provisions advising prisoners of their rights to order or to have access to \nmagazines or saft-caver books through the mail from bookstores or distributors, including those \npublished or distributed by plaintiffs. \n27.  Defendants' have a pre-printed fonn, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office \"Mail \nReturn Fonn\", which is presumably designed to accompany mail which is being returned to the \nsender.  This pre-printed form provides a checklist of potential reasons for mail heing returned to \nthe sender (\"This letter/package was returned by the Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office Mailroom \nfor the following reasons checked below:\"). The category relevant to books and magazines \naddressed to prisoners which are being returned, states, \n\"Books, magazines and newspapers (including newspaper articles, \nxeroxed copies of books, and books printed off of the Intranet) [sic] are \nprohibited.  These items must be purchased through the Commissary or \nmust be approved by the facility Warden prior to being sent.\" \n28.  On information and belief this form is intended to provide notice to the sender of \nrejected mail of the reasons for the rejection. However, this fonn merely states a blanket policy \nprohibiting all books, magazines and newspapers sent directly to prisoners and fails to specify \nwhy a particular book, magazine or newspaper is being rejected.  The form also fails to provide \nany infonnation for publishers, distributors or bookstores of how to submit books to the various \nfacility wardens so as to obtain \"prior approval\" or any information regarding how a publisher, \ndistributor or bookstore can distribute its reading materials through the inmate commissary list. \nThere is also no notice of any procedures for appealing if a warden has censored and excluded \n10 \n\nreading materials. Additionally. if a book, magazine or newspaper is censored and excluded \nbased upon its content (or \"context\" as lndex #1401.2 policy states) there is no provision in the \nOPSO Mail Return Form to require or provide information specifying or explaining any content \nbased rejection. The form itself combines books, magazines and newspapers even though, \naccording to Index#140 1.2, the facility warden's prior approval requirement only applies to \nbooks, not to magazines, newspapers or periodicals, which can only be purchased through the \ncommissary. \n29.  Defendants' policies and practices regarding soft-cover books, magazines, and \nperiodicals are unconstitutional on their face and as applied regarding books and magazines sent \nby publishers and distributors such as plaintiffs, via U.S. mail, to prisoners confined at OPP. \n30.  Defendants have also failed to establish a constitutionally valid policy or practice \nto provide adequate notice to plaintiffs and an opportunity to be heard regarding the reasons for \nexclusion of soft-cover books, magazines and periodicals and the procedures for appealing same. \n31.  On information and belief, numerous copies ofPLN the magazine have not been \ndelivered to OPP subscribers due to the policies and practices of the defendants, despite plaintiffs \nregularly mailing the magazine every month via U. S. Mail, postage prepaid and addressed to the \nindividual subscribers at OPP. \n32.  Plaintiffs have received nineteen (19) returned copies of the December, 2010 issue \nofPLN the magazine, which were mailed to subscribers atOPP. Noinfonnation at all was \nprovided to explain the censorship and exclusion oftbis issue and no \"Mail Return Form\" was \nfurnished with the returns. The addresses of the subscribers were merely scratched oul and the \nmagazine returned without explanation. \nII \n\n33.  In Oct. 2010, plaintiffs sent via U.S. mail a copy of the August, 2010 issue ofPLN \nthe magazine to an OPP subscriber. This issue was returned to the sender, with a \"Mail Return \nFonn\" with the category regarding returns of books, magazines, etc. checked off.  In addition, the \nform had a hand-written notation next to the category saying \"Prison Legal News\" with no \nfurther explanation. The identity or position of the individuates) who filled out the fonn was not \nprovided. No notice of any opportunity or procedure for review or appeal of this decision was \nprovided to plaintiffs. \n34.  Plaintiffs also received correspondence from five (5) OPP subscribers to PLN the \nmagazine who informed plaintiffs that they never received their subscriptions. Plaintiffs received \nno notice from the defendants regarding the failure to deliver these subscriptions. Plaintiffs also \nnever received a return of the magazines. \n35.  Plaintiffs also mailed thirty-five (35) copies of the soft-cover book \"Protecting \nYour Health and Safety\" to subscribers in the Orleans Parish Prison.  Eight (8) copies of this \nbook were returned to plaintiffs. None of them had a Mail Return Form enclosed.  The outside of \nthe packages containing the books were variously marked as follows: \nI. \"Return to Sender\" stamped. \n2. \"Legal\", \"Refused by Warden\", and CLUS6-03, handwritten. \"Return to \nSender\" stamped. \n3. \"Refused by Warden\", handwritten. \n4. \"Return to Sender\" stamped. CLU N602 handwritten. \n5. \"Refused by Warden\" and CLUS6-03 handwritten. \"Return to Sender\" \nstamped. \n12 \n\n6. \"Refused by Warden\" and TP5N(?) handwritten. \"Return to Sender\" \nstamped. \n7. \"Return to Sender\" stamped. \"See enclosed\" with arrow, handwritten. \n8. HODS7-0 I and what appears to be the prisoner's folder number are \nhandwritten. \"Return to Sender\" stamped. \nFor those marked \"Refused by Warden\", the name of the Warden(s) refusing the publication was \nnot provided nor were any reasons given for the censorship and exclusion of the book. No notice \nof any opportunity or procedure for review or appeal of these decisions was provided to \nplaintiffs. \n36.  On Sept 15,2010 a copy of \"Protecting Health and Safety\" was sent by plaintiffs, \nvia U.S. mail, postage prepaid to a PLN subscriber at OPP. That copy of the book was returned to \nplaintiffs in Oct., 2010 in the original packaging. A \"Mail Return Fonn\" was enclosed, with the \ncategory regarding returns of books, magazines, etc. checked off. In addition, there was a hand \nwritten notation stating \"Anything prison related.\" The identity or position of the individual(s) \nwho filled out the fonn was not provided. No notice of any opportunity or procedure for review \nor appeal of this decision was provided to plaintiffs. \n37.  In addition to those eight (8) books which were returned to plaintiffs, plaintiffs \nhave received correspondence from another four (4) subscribers at OPP advising that they never \nreceived their copies of the book. The books sent to those 4 subscribers were never returned to \nplaintiffs. Plaintiff received no notice from the defendants of the failure to deliver these books. \nPlaintiffs return address was furnished on all magazines and book packages which were mailed \nto OPP subscribers. \n13 \n\n38.  One PLN subscriber in custody of the defendants reported receiving, \"brochures, \n'Prison Legal News' booklet and the book on 'Protecting Your Health and Safety'''.  However, \nthe December 2010 issue of PLN the magazine addressed to that same subscriber was censored \nand excluded and returned to plaintiffs with no explanation and no Mail Return Form. \n39.  On infonnation and belief, defendants are not making individualized \ndeterminations about the content of each publication before censoring and excluding them, in \nviolation of clearly established First Amendment Jaw. \n40.  In addition, the censorship and exclusion of these publications by defendants is \narbitrary and random and void of any constitutionally valid standards or criteria. \n41.  The defendants' written policy that allows censorship and exclusion of books \nprotected by the JSl Amendment on the grounds of being \"unacceptable\", is void for vagueness \nand overbroad. \n42.  The contents ofPLN the magazine and \"Protecting Your Health and Safety\" are \nprotected speech and expression and these publications have been unlawfully censored and \nexcluded by defendants. \n43.  Plaintiffs have not been provided with adequate notice regarding the censorship \nand exclusion of their magazine and books nor have plaintiffs been provided with a meaningful \nopportunity to be heard or to contest the decisions of the defendants which prevent individuals in \ncustody at the Orleans Parish Prison from receiving the plaintiffs' publications or the books \nplaintiffs distribute. \n44.  Defendants' policy and practice fails to provide plaintiffs with any alternative \nmeans of exercising plaintiffs' rights to free speech and expression in distributing plaintiffs' \n14 \n\npublications and exchanging information with their readership, customers and supporters of \notherwise legal reading materials.  Neither PLN the monthly magazine or any of the books which \nplaintiffs distribute, are available through the Orleans Parish Prison commissary. \n45.  Accommodation of the free speech, free expression and due process of rights of \nplaintiffs with respect to materials protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution, will not have any significant impact on the operations and security of the Orleans \nParish Prison. \n46.  Readily available alternatives exist to defendants' current policies and practices \nwhich could easily meet any legitimate or significant interests of defendants without sacrificing \nthe free speech and expression and due process of rights of plaintiffs, as well as other publishers \nand distributors of books and materials protected by the First Amendment to persons in the \ncustody of the defendants. \n47.  Defendants know, should have known or must have known that their policies and \npractices were unconstitutional and violated plaintiffs rights to free speech, expression and due \nprocess. \n48.  Defendants' actions, as described herein, were done willfully, wantonly, \nmaliciously andlor with reckless disregard. \n49.  Due to the defendants' actions as described herein, the plaintiffs have suffered \ndamages, including violation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, including the right to \ndisseminate plaintiffs' message, loss of potential subscribers, customers, correspondents and \nsupporters, diversion of resources, loss of reputation, and other damages to be shown at trial. \n50.  Due to the defendants' actions as described herein, the plaintiffs have suffered and \n15 \n\nwill continue to suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \nCause of Action I \nFreedom of Speech and Expression \n51.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate paragraphs 1 through 50 herein. \n52.  Defendants' policy and practice of arbitrary and unlawful exclusion of \"Prison \nLegal News\" the magazine and books and written materials distributed by plaintiffs, violates \nplaintiffs' rights of free speech and expression secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the U.S. Constitution. \n53.  Plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in communicating with \nincarcerated individuals.  This right is clearly established under existing case law. \n54.  The defendants' failure to establish constitutionally valid standards to govern the \ndecision-making of facility wardens relative to censorship of publications sent on request via \nU.S. mail 10 prisoners in custody of the defendants, permits impermissible viewpoint \ndiscrimination and the rejection of reading materials for reasons unrelated to any legitimate \npenological interest, in violation of the lSi and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n55.  Defendants' policies and practices do not further any legitimate penological \ninterest. \nCause of Action II \nDue Process of Law \n56.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate paragraphs I through 50 herein. \n57.  Defendants' policy and practice regarding rejection of publications protected by \nthe  and 141b Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and published and distributed by plaintiffs, \nlSI \n16 \n\nfails to provide adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard, in violation of the Due Process \nClause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This right is clearly established under \nexisting case law. \n58.  Defendants' failure to consistently provide plaintiffs with adequate notice and an \nopportunity to be heard that their publications were being rejected from distribution to their \nsubscribers does not further any legitimate penological interest. \nPrayer for Relief \nTHEREFORE, plaintiffs request that the Court: \nI.  Declare that the rights of the plaintiffs were violated by the defendants and that \ndefendants policies and practices are unconstitutional; \n2.  Award compensatory and punitive damages against the defendants; \n3.  Grant declaratory and injunctive relief; \n4.  Grant reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses and court costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. Section 1988; and \n5.  Grant all other and further relief as appears reasonable and just, to which plaintiffs \nmay be entitled. \nRespectfully submitted, \nMtE;o~ \nAttorney at Law \n316 S.

On September 9, 2011, plaintiffs filed suit in the above-captioned \nmatter seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, attorneys fees and costs, \nagainst the named defendants. The Complaint alleged an unlawful policy, practice \nand custom regarding failure to deliver incoming publications addressed to prisoners \nwho were held at the Orleans Parish jail, in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution and 42 USC 1983. The Complaint also \nalleged violations of due process of the law due to the failure to give notice and an \nopportunity to respond, to the plaintiff publishers and distributors whose publications \nwere denied access to their subscribers. \n2.  On October 11, 2011 plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary \n1 \n\n.  Case 2:11-cv-02277-JCZ-SS   Document 32   Filed 12/02/11   Page 2 of 4\n' \nInjunction, with attached Memorandum and Exhibits. On October 26, 2011 the Court \nissued a Minute Entry noting that the parties were working to resolve the issue \namicably and referred the parties to U.S. Magistrate Shushan for scheduling of a \nsettlement conference. \n3.  The parties, with the assistance and oversight of the U.S. District Court \nJudge and Magistrate,  have engaged in on-going negotiations in an attempt to \namicably resolve this matter.  The defendants deny liability. However, in order to put \nan end to this phase of the litigation and to avoid unnecessary expense and the \nuncertainties of future litigation regarding the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief, \nthe parties have agreed to the following terms and conditions: (1) The defendants \nhave consented to the distribution of plaintiffs' monthly publication, Prison Legal \nNews, along with copies of Protecting Your Health and Safety, a prisoner self-help \nguide distributed by plaintiffs, to plaintiffs' subscribers at the Orleans Parish jail. (2) \nThe defendants have agreed to adopt and implement a new written policy and \nprocedure, which the parties agree is constitutional, regarding \"Incoming \nPublications\" for prisoners at the Orleans Parish jail, attached hereto as Exhibit A \nand incorporated herein.  This policy and procedure will be in effect regarding all \nfuture incoming publications to prisoners in custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriffs \nOffice, including but not limited to those published and distributed by plaintiffs. \n4.  The parties agree, and the Court so orders, that defendant Sheriff \nMarlin N. Gusman, his agents, assigns, employees, wardens, deputies and \nsuccessors, will establish, implement and enforce the policy and procedure set forth \nin Exhibit A, incorporated herein. \n2 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02277-JCZ-SS   Document 32   Filed 12/02/11   Page 3 of 4\n'  ' \n5.  It is further agreed and ordered, that within 30 days of the date of entry \nof this Consent Judgment, the defendant Sheriff Marlin N. Gusman will (1) insure \nthat this new policy and procedure is disseminated to all employees of the Orleans \nParish jail as well as to all persons in custody at the jail and will be fully implemented \nand (2) make appropriate changes to the Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office website, \nOPSO Policy Index #1401.2 and the OPSO Inmate Orientation Form to reflect the \npolicies and procedures adopted herein. Defendants' counsel will furnish the Court \nand plaintiffs' counsel with written confirmation of same. \n6.  The parties to this Consent Judgment agree that the provisions herein \nfully and fairly accommodate the interests of the parties hereto regarding the issue \nof injunctive relief only in this matter, that the Court should adopt and approve this \nagreement as a Consent Judgment, and that this Consent Judgment is a full and \nfinal judgment between the parties with regard to permanent injunctive relief only. \n7.  All remaining claims are specifically reserved by plaintiffs and denied \nby defendants. The Magistrate is ordered to schedule a settlement conference with \nthe parties in an effort to explore possible amicable resolution of the remaining \nissues of damages, declaratory relief and reasonable attorneys fees and costs. \n8.  This Court retains jurisdiction of this action in order to enforce the \nterms of this Consent Judgment, to determine reasonable attorneys fees and costs \nand the remaining issues relating to plaintiffs' claims for damages and declaratory \nrelief, to resolve any disputes regarding the implementation and enforcement of this \nConsent Judgment and all other issues of this lawsuit not otherwise covered by this \nConsent Judgment. \n3 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02277-JCZ-SS   Document 32   Filed 12/02/11   Page 4 of 4\nWHEREFORE, having fully read and considered the provisions set forth \nabove, plaintiffs and defendants having stipulated and agreed to the above terms \nand conditions, and the Court having approved the entry of this Consent Judgment, \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n2nJ  Peamb:r, \nNew Orleans, Louisiana this  day of  2011. \nU.S. Dl \nAGREED TO BY: \n~ \n~ 'ยฃk.-t~ \nARY E.

GUSMAN \nORLEANS PARISH SHERIFF'S OFFICE IOPSOl \nINCOMING PUBLICATIONS POLICY \n1.  Purpose and Scope \nExcept when precluded by law, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office (OPSO) \npermits an inmate to subscribe to or to receive publications without prior approval \nand has established procedures to determine if an incoming publication is \ndetrimental to the security, discipline, or good order of the institution or if it might \nfacilitate criminal activity. \nThe term publication, as used in this subpart, means a book, booklet, pamphlet, \nor similar document, or a single issue of a magazine, periodical, newsletter, \nnewspaper, plus such other materials addressed to a specific inmate such as \nadvertising brochures, flyers, and catalogs. \nThe Sheriff of Orleans Parish is the final policymaker. The Sheriff has delegated \nto the Chief Deputy the final authority for decision-making regarding \nimplementation of this policy. All grievances or requests for reconsideration of a \ndecision to reject a publication are complete upon the rendering of a final \ndecision by the Chief Deputy. \n2.  Program Objectives.  The expected results of this program are: \na.  Inmates will be permitted to receive and retain publications which do not \nthreaten security, good order, or discipline of the institution or that may \nfacilitate criminal activity, or are otherwise prohibited by law. \nb.  Publications determined detrimental to the security, good order, or \ndiscipline of the institution or that may facilitate criminal activity, or are \notherwise prohibited by law, will be excluded from OPSO facilities. \nc.  A safer environment for staff and inmates will be provided by \nstrengthening procedures designed to prevent the introduction of \ncontraband. \n3.  Application.  Procedures in this Incoming Publication Policy apply to all \ncorrectional facilities under the jurisdiction and control of the Orleans Parish \nSheriff's Office. \n4.  Procedures \na.  At all Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office (OPSO) institutions, an inmate may \n1 \nEXHIBIT \nI  A \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02277-JCZ-SS   Document 32-1   Filed 12/02/11   Page 2 of 8\nreceive soft-cover publications (for example,  paperback books, \nmagazines, and other similar items) only from the publisher, a distributor, \na book club, or a bookstore. \nb.  The Chief Deputy may make an exception to the provisions of paragraph \n4(a) if the publication is no longer available from the publisher, a \ndistributor, book club or bookstore or is only available in hard-cover.  An \ninmate requesting an exception to paragraph 4(a) shall provide the Chief \nDeputy with written documentation that the publication is no longer \navailable from these sources or is only available in hard-cover.  The Chief \nDeputy shall review all requests for exceptions within 10 days and make \nreasonable accommodations to make the requested publication available \nto the inmate.  Any response to a request for exceptions shall be \ndocumented, in writing, and provided to the requesting inmate within 10 \ndays.  The decision of the Chief Deputy on any exception to paragraph \n4(a) is a final decision for purposes of administrative review. \nc.  The Chief Deputy may reject a publication only if it is determined \ndetrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it \nmight facilitate criminal activity.  The Chief Deputy may not reject a \npublication solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, \nsocial or sexual, or because its content is unpopular or repugnant. \nPublications which may be rejected by the Chief Deputy include but are \nnot limited to publications which meet one of the following criteria: \n(1)  It depicts or describes procedures for the construction or use of \nweapons, ammunition, bombs or incendiary devices; \n(2)  It depicts, encourages, or describes methods of escape from \ncorrectional facilities, or contains blueprints, drawings or similar \ndescriptions of Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office institutions; \n(3)  It depicts or describes procedures for the brewing of alcoholic \nbeverages, or the manufacture of drugs; \n(4)  It is written in code; \n(5)  It depicts, describes or encourages activities which may lead to the \nuse of physical violence or group disruption; \n(6)  It encourages or instructs in the commission of criminal activity. \n(7)  It is sexually explicit material which by its nature or content poses a \nthreat to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution, or \n2 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02277-JCZ-SS   Document 32-1   Filed 12/02/11   Page 3 of 8\nfacilitates criminal activity. \nOnly the Chief Deputy may reject an incoming publication. If a Warden or \nMailroom Supervisor questions the suitability of an incoming publication, \npursuant to the criteria set forth in this policy, the publication must be \nreferred to the Chief Deputy within three (3) days of receipt of the \nincoming publication at the jail. In the absence of the Chief Deputy, the \nActing Chief Deputy may perform this function. \nd.  The Chief Deputy may not establish an excluded list of publications.  The \nChief Deputy shall review the individual publication in question prior to the \nrejection of that publication.

In questionable cases, the Chief Deputy should \nconsult with legal staff. \ng.  The publisher/sender of a publication preliminarily rejected by the Chief \nDeputy shall also be furnished with a copy of the notice of preliminary \nrejection provided to the inmate, by promptly mailing a copy of the notice \nto the publisher/sender.  The Chief Deputy shall advise the \npublisher/sender that he or she may obtain re-consideration of the \npreliminary finding by writing to the Chief Deputy of Orleans Parish within \n30 days of receipt of the notice of preliminary rejection. \nSee Notice to Inmate and Publisher/Sender of Preliminary Rejection of \nIncoming Publication (Attachment A) for a sample notice to inmate and \npublisher/sender. \nh.

At the end of \nthe re-consideration period, the rejected publication may be disposed of \nas provided in Section 5(n) herein. \nk.  If a request for re-consideration is filed by either the inmate and/or the \npublisher/sender, the Chief Deputy shall wait until the entire time period \nfor filing requests for re-consideration has expired, before issuing his or \nher final decision. \nI.  The inmate and the publisher/ sender must be promptly notified of the final \ndecision of the Chief Deputy. If the final decision is made to reject the \npublication, written notice of the final decision and the reasons for it, shall \nbe furnished to the inmate and the publisher/sender. \nSee Notice to Inmate and Publisher/Sender of Final Decision Rejecting \nIncoming Publication (Attachment B) for a sample notice to inmate and \npublisher/sender. \nm.

If no request for reconsideration is timely submitted by either the inmate or \nthe publisher/sender after the time periods for requesting re-consideration \nhave lapsed, or if after re-consideration, the Chief Deputy issues a final \ndecision upholding the rejection, the Chief Deputy shall provide the inmate \nwith the following options of disposing of the rejected publication: \n(1) return to sender; \n(2) send to person or entity designated by the inmate to receive \nrejected publications, or \n(3) any other mutually agreeable disposition. \n4 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02277-JCZ-SS   Document 32-1   Filed 12/02/11   Page 5 of 8\no.
