    "summary": "<p>On May 17, 2010, a group of organizations and individuals filed this lawsuit against the sheriff and district attorney of each of the fifteen counties in Arizona, in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court of Arizona. The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that S.B. 1070 conflicted with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies were ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law. For example, one provision of S.B. 1070 allowed police officers to ask for identification during a routine stop if there is a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the individual is not a U.S. citizen. The plaintiffs claimed that this provision was written primarily to provide a pretextual reason to stop an individual for some other state or local law violation in order to investigate that individual's immigration status. Immigration status, however, is not easily determined through an identification card of some kind—federal authorities may be aware of an individual's presence in the country but may not be pursuing deportation proceedings. The plaintiffs contended that local law enforcement lacked the training and knowledge to investigate immigration status. </p><p>On June 4, 2010, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. The court (Judge Susan R. Bolton) held a hearing on June 22, 2010, and stated that the motions would be held under advisement. On June 18, 2010, the court granted the State of Arizona and the governor's motions to intervene as defendants. </p><p>On June 25, 2010, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to transfer related case. In this order, the court allowed the transfer of four other cases challenging the constitutionality of S.B. 1070.</p><p>On October 8, 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part motions to dismiss filed by several of the defendants. The plaintiffs' first preliminary injunction motion, regarding certain provisions of S.B. 1070, was denied. At oral argument, the plaintiff withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction regarding part of S.B. 1070 based on the NInth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in <i>Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach</i>. The court found that a preliminary injunction was moot because an injunction was already issued in the related case <i>United States v. Arizona</i>. This case and <i>United States v. Arizona</i> challenged enforcement of the same provisions of S.B. 1070.  </p><p>On January 7, 2011, the plaintiffs filed another motion requesting a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendant from enforcing the provision of S.B. 1070 affected by the Redondo Beach case. On May 10, 2011, the court denied this motion without prejudice to its refiling at a later time because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had not yet issued their opinion from the en banc court.</p><p>In October 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and a third motion for a preliminary Injunction.</p><p>On February 29, 2012, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the defendants from enforcing A.R.S. § 13-2928 (A) and (B). This section of the law was intended to prevent employment solicitation on roadways where it interferes with the proper flow of traffic.  </p><p>The State of Arizona, as an intervenor-defendant, appealed the issuance of the preliminary injunction and, on May 9, 2012, filed their opening brief with the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>The plaintiff sought class action status in their original complaint and on December 12, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class. While that motion was pending, on June 25, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in <i>Arizona v. United States</i>, affirming in part and reversing in part. The Court held that several provisions of S.B. 1070 were properly enjoined but declined to strike down Section 2(B), which required state police to check the immigration status of people arrested under nonimmigration state law. The Court explained that the legality of the provision would depend on how it was construed—if it did not authorize extra detention time, it may be constitutional.</p><p>Following that Supreme Court decision, the plaintiffs in this case filed a motion for preliminary injunction on July 17, 2012, seeking an injunction against two sections of the law. The plaintiffs requested that the court preliminarily enjoin § 2(B) on preemption, Fourth Amendment, and Equal Protection Clause bases, and A.R.S. § 13-2929 on preemption grounds.</p><p>On March 27, 2013, the court affirmed the preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the day labor provisions. On April 9, 2013, the district court dismissed some of plaintiffs' claims in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in <i>Arizona v. United States</i>. The parties went through discovery and on March 17, 2015, the defendant moved for summary judgment with regard to plaintiffs' claims under the Supremacy Clause (Count One), Equal Protection Clause (Count Two), the First Amendment (Count Three), the Fourth Amendment (Count Four), Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution (Count Five), the Due Process Clause (Count Six), and 42 U.S.C. §1981 (Count Seven).</p><p>On September 4, 2015, the district court granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment for Counts One, Two, Four, Five, Six, and Seven. The district court, however, entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the claim in Count Three. In other words, the court found that plaintiffs had not presented any evidence that police would enforce S.B. 1070 differently for Latinos than other people and that the plaintiffs failed to prove that § 2(B) was unconstitutional. The court also found that parts of the law targeting day laborers violated the First Amendment free speech protections. </p><p>The parties filed cross-appeals to the Ninth Circuit. Before that appeal was decided, however, the plaintiffs and intervenor-defendants settled. The parties stipulated that the defendants would release an informal attorney general opinion, which would provide guidelines for the implementation of §§ 2(b) and 2(d) of S.B. 1070, among other sections. The parties also stipulated that A.R.S. §§ 28-3511A (1)(d) and (e) would be</p><p>enjoined, and asked the court to enjoin those provisions. Finally, the plaintiffs would receive attorneys’ fees and costs totaling $1.4 million. On September 19, 2016, the court entered an order enforcing all of these stipulations.</p><p>There have been no further developments in this case; the case is presumably closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On May 17, 2010, a group of organizations and individuals filed a lawsuit against the Sheriff and Attorney of each of the 15 counties in Arizona, in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court of Arizona, Phoenix Division.  The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Specifically, the plaintiff contends that S.B. 1070 conflicts with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies are ill equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law.\r\n\r\nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction in February 2012, which the defendants appealed.  In a related case, Arizona v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of S.B. 1070.  The plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the remaining provisions of S.B. 1070 and while the parties were going through discovery disputes, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on March 17, 2015. The plaintiff filed a response to the defendant's summary judgment and on September 4, 2015, the district court ruled in favor of the defendant with regard to plaintiff's claims under the Supremacy Clause, Equal Protection Clause, the Fourth Amendment, Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution, the Due Process Clause, and 42 U.S.C. §1981. Notably, the court also entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on count three claim which was appealed. Finally, on September 15, 2016, both parties conferred and filed a joint case disposition in which the plaintiff settled for $1.4 million. ",

Whiting, et al.,  )\n13 )\nDefendants.  )\n14 )\n)\n15\n16\n17 This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Preliminary\n18 Injunction of Arizona Revised Statutes (“A.R.S.”) § 13-2928(A) and (B) (“3d PI Mot.”)\n19 (Doc. 510).\n20 I. BACKGROUND\n21 The facts of this case were set forth in this Court’s Order of October 8, 2010, which\n22 is incorporated fully herein. (See Doc. 447, Oct. 8, 2010, Order at 1-4.) The pertinent details\n23 are briefly summarized here. Plaintiffs bring av  ariety of challenges to Arizona’s Senate Bill\n24 1070 (“S.B. 1070”), the “Support Our Law Enforcem ent and Safe Neighborhoods Act,”\n25 which was signed into law by Governor Brewer on April 23, 2010. 1 Among S.B. 1070’s\n26\n27 1 In this Order, the Court refers to Senate Bill 1070 and House Bill 2162 collectively\nas “S.B. 1070,” describing the April 23, 2010, enactment as modified by the April 30, 2010,\n28\namendments.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 2 of 13\n1 components, Section 5 added A.R.S. § 13-2928 to the Arizona Criminal Code. A.R.S. § 13-\n2 2928(A) makes it unlawful for an occupant of a motor vehicle that is stopped on a street,\n3 roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic to attempt to hire a person for work at another\n4 location. Similarly, A.R.S. § 13-2928(B) provides that it is unlawful for a person to enter a\n5 motor vehicle in order to be hired if the vehicle is stopped on a street, roadway, or highway\n6 and is impeding traffic. S.B. 1070 had an effective date of July 29, 2010; on July 28, 2010,\n7 the Court preliminarily enjoined certain provisions of the law, not including A.R.S. § 13-\n8 2928(A) and (B), from taking effect, in the related case United States v. Arizona, CV 10-\n9 1413-PHX-SRB. \n10 Plaintiffs in this case also m oved for a preliminary injunction as to a num ber of\n11 provisions of the law. (See Doc. 235, Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim . Inj. (“1st PI Mot.”).) At oral\n12 argument on the first Motion for Preliminary Injunction, counsel for Plaintiffs withdrew their\n13 request for an injunction running to A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B). (Oct. 8, 2010, Order at\n14 35.)  In the October 8, 2010, Order, the Court ruled that Plaintiffs’ first Motion for\n15 Preliminary Injunction was m oot in light of the injunction entered in  United States v.\n16 Arizona. (Id. at 34-35.) The Court also found that Plaintiffs had stated a claim with regard\n17 to their challenge to A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) on First Amendment grounds. (Id. at 19-\n18 20.) \n19 Plaintiffs renewed their Motion for preliminary injunctive relief as to A.R.S. § 13-\n20 2928(A) and (B) on January 7, 2011. (Doc. 457, Pls.’M  ot. for Prelim. Inj. (“2d PI Mot.”) at\n21 2.) The Court denied the renewed Motion without prejudice on May 10, 2011, ruling that the\n22 outcome would be “at least impacted, if not determined” by the decision of the en banc court\n23 of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of\n24 Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc). (Doc. 487, May 10, 2011, Order at\n25 3.) On September 16, 2011, sitting en banc, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the\n26 three-judge panel’s decision in Redondo Beach and held that a Redondo Beach ordinance\n27 prohibiting solicitation of business, employment, and contributions on streets and highways\n28 was not narrowly tailored to achieve the city’s interest in promoting traffic flow and safety\n- 2 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 3 of 13\n1 and thus violated the free speech guarantees of the First Am endment. 657 F.3d at 948.\n2 Plaintiffs now renew their Motion for Preliminary Injunction for the third time, arguing that\n3 “[u]nder both the previous holding of this Court and the en banc Ninth Circuit’s holding in\n4 [Redondo Beach], A.R.S. []§ 13-2928(A) and (B) are unconstitutional restrictions on\n5 speech.” (3d PI Mot. at 1.) The Court headr oral argument on this Motion on January 9, 2012.\n6 (See Doc. 577, Minute Entry.)\n7 II. LEGAL STANDARDS AND ANALYSIS\n8 A. Preliminary Injunction Standard\n9 Plaintiffs seek to enjoin A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B). (3d PI Mot. at 1.) “A plaintiff\n10 seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that\n11 he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance\n12 of equities tips in his favor, and that anin junction is in the public interest.” W  inter v. Natural\n13 Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \n14 B. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n15 1. Commercial Speech v. Noncommercial Speech\n16 The Intervenor Defendants (“Defendants”) argue that Plaintiffs are not likely to\n17 succeed on the merits of their claim that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) violate the First\n18 Amendment because these provisions are “contsitutional restrictions on commercial speech,”\n19 properly evaluated under a more deferential standard than non-commercial speech. (Doc.\n20 553, Defs.’ Resp. to 3d PI Mot. (“Defs.’ Resp.”) at 6.) Plaintiffs argue that the commercial\n21 speech test should not be applied to A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B), but, if it were, the\n22 provisions would not pass muster under even the more lenient standard. (Doc. 567, Pls.’\n23 Reply in Supp. of 3d PI Mot. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 1.) \n24 The Supreme Court has defined “commercial speech” as “speech that does no more\n25 than propose a commercial transaction.” United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405,\n26 409 (2001); see also Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y. , 447\n27 U.S. 557, 562 (1980) (defining “com mercial speech” as “expression related solely to the\n28 economic interests of the speaker and its audience”). Com mercial speech is generally\n- 3 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 4 of 13\n1 accorded less protection than other kinds of speech. United Foods, 533 U.S. at 409.\n2 Plaintiffs argue that speech by day laborers soliciting work “is not ‘com mercial\n3 speech’ under the First Amendment because day labor solicitation inextricably intertwines\n4 a request for work with politic al and economic messages communicating day laborers’\n5 existence, need for subsistence, social value  and claims to inclusion.” (Pls.’ Reply at 8.)\n6 Although commercial speech is entitled to less protection under the First Am endment,\n7 “[c]ommercial speech does not retain its com mercial character ‘when it is inextricably\n8 intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech.’” H  unt v. City of L.A., 638 F.3d 703, 715\n9 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796\n10 (1988)). On the contrary, “where the two components of speech can be easily separated, they\n11 are not ‘inextricably intertwined.’” Id.  Plaintiffs cite Redondo Beach, in which the court\n12 stated, “Solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive\n13 speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular views on economic, political,\n14 or social issues, so that without solicitation the flow of such inforamtion and advocacy would\n15 likely cease.” 657 F.3d at 945 (quotations and citation om itted). However, the Redondo\n16 Beach court went on to comment that the ordinance being reviewed in that case was not\n17 limited to commercial solicitation, so “we cannot, and do not, decide the [o] rdinance’s\n18 validity under the Supreme Court’s ‘commercial speech’ case law.” Id. at 945 n.2. \n19 In contrast, A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) expressly apply to hiring, picking up, and\n20 transporting people for work. See A.R.S. § 13-2928(A), (B). The speech of day laborers\n21 seeking work from passing motorists “does no more than propose a commercial transaction”\n22 between the day laborer and the potential employer. See United Foods, 533 U.S. at 409. The\n23 Court finds that the speech impacted by these provisions is exclusively commercial speech,\n24 and, even if it were not, any intertwined expression of day laborers’ existence or social value\n25 is easily separated from the commercial speech involved in soliciting work. Thus, the Court\n26\n27\n28\n- 4 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 5 of 13\n1 is obliged to apply the commercial speech test as established by the Supreme Court.2, 3 \n2 2. Commercial Speech Test and Application\n3 The Supreme Court set forth a four-part test to determ ine the constitutionality of a\n4 restriction on commercial speech in Central Hudson: \n5 (1) if the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity,\nthen it merits First Amendment scrutiny as a threshold matter; in order for the\n6 restriction to withstand such scrutiny, (2) [t]he State must assert a substantial\ninterest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech; (3) the restriction\n7 must directly advance the state interest involved; and (4) it must not be more\nextensive than is necessary to serve that interest. \n8\nWorld Wide Rush, LLC v. City of L.A., 606 F.3d 676, 684 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotations and\n9\ncitation omitted). “[T]he last two steps of the Central Hudson analysis basically involve a\n10\nconsideration of the fit between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish\n11\nthose ends.” Id. (quotation and citation omitted). The Supreme Court recently refined the\n12\nCentral  Hudson  test, holding that if a ban on com mercial  speech is content-based,\n13\n“heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted.” Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653,\n14\n2664 (2011); see also id. at 2673 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority applies a\n15\n“far stricter, specially ‘heightened’ First Amendment standard,” rather than the usualC entral\n16\nHudson test).\n17\n18\n2 Because the Court concludes that the speech at issue here is properly analyzed as\n19\ncommercial speech, Redondo Beach does not control.\n20\n3 Plaintiffs point out that in the October 8, 2010, Order, the Court found that A.R.S.\n21 § 13-2928(A) and (B) were content-based and subject to strict scrutiny. (3d PI Mot. at 8\n(citing Oct. 8, 2010, Order at 20).) While this is true, in the previous Order, the Court was\n22\nconsidering a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which\n23 only tests the sufficiency of the pleadings, not a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, which\nexamines the likelihood of success on the m erits. Furthermore, neither party raised the\n24\nquestion of commercial speech in the previ ous round of Motions,  so the Court was not\nsquarely presented with this issue. Application of the law of the case doctrine, “a judicial\n25\ninvention designed to aid in the efficient operation of court affairs,” is discretionarMy. ilgard\n26 Tempering, Inc. v. Selas Corp. of Am., 902 F.2d 703, 715 (9th Cir. 1990). In its discretion,\nthe Court now concludes that the com mercial speech test applies to the determ ination of\n27\nwhether Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that A.R.S.\n28 § 13-2928(A) and (B) are barred by the First Amendment.\n- 5 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 6 of 13\n1 The Court has previously found that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) are content-based\n2 because  they apply only to speech soliciting em ployment  and not to other types of\n3 solicitation speech. (Oct. 8, 2010, Order at 20);c f. City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network,\n4 Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 429 (1993) (considering a ban on the use of newsracks for commercial\n5 handbills, as opposed to newspapers and holding that “the very basis for the regulation is the\n6 difference in content between ordinary newspapers and commercial speech. . . . Thus, by any\n7 commonsense understanding of the term, the ban in this case is ‘content based.’”). InS orrell,\n8 the Supreme Court emphasized the second, third, and fourth elements of the Central Hudson\n9 test, stating, “To sustain the targeted, content-based burden [the statute at issue ]imposes on\n10 protected expression, the State m ust show at least that the statute directly advances a\n11 substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.” 131\n12 S. Ct. at 2667-68. Accordingly, if a ban  on commercial speech is content-based, Sorrell\n13 instructs that it must be “drawn to achieve” “a substantial governmental interest,” whereas\n14 the Central Hudson test requires that the regulation not be “more extensive than is necessary\n15 to serve that interest.” Compare id., with Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566.\n16 a. Related to Unlawful Activity \n17 Defendants argue that the “conduct” restricted by A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) is\n18 “blocking or impeding traffic” and “is already unlawful.” (Defs.’ Resp. at 9.) However, this\n19 argument misses the mark: the test requires that the communication “concern lawful activity\n20 and not be m isleading.” Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. The com munication allegedly\n21 impacted by Arizona’s law concerns day labor, not blocking or impeding traffic. Defendants\n22 do not argue, as indeed they cannot, that day labor in and of itself is unlawful.S ee Va. State\n23 Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. , 425 U.S. 748, 772 (1976)\n24 (observing that commercial speech is unprotected by the First Am endment where “the\n25 transactions proposed . . . are themselves illegal in any way”); Hispanic Interest Coal. of Ala.\n26 v. Bentley, No. 5:11-CV-2484-SLB, 2011 WL 5516953, at *34 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 28, 2011)\n27 (holding that “the solicitation of day labor . . . is a ‘lawful concern’”). Therefore, the Court\n28 finds that these provisions “merit[] First Amendment scrutiny as a threshold matter.” See\n- 6 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 7 of 13\n1 World Wide Rush, 606 F.3d at 684 (quotation and citation omitted).\n2 b. Governmental Interest\n3 Defendants identify several interests that Arizona seeks to advance through these\n4 provisions: “crime reduction, traffic safety, econom ic development, and protecting the\n5 aesthetics of its communities.”4 (Defs.’ Resp. at 9.) Plaintiffs do not contest that these are\n6 substantial governmental interests. Indeed, all of Arizona’s asserted interests have been found\n7 to be at least “substantial.”S ee City of L.A. v. Alameda Books, Inc,. 535 U.S. 425, 435 (2002)\n8 (finding that “reducing crime is a substantial government interest”); Metromedia, Inc. v. City\n9 of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 507-08 (1981) (concluding that there can be no “substantial\n10 doubt that the twin goals that the ordinance seeks to further–traffic safety and the appearance\n11 of the city–are substantial governmental goals”); Hampton Int’l Commc’ns, Inc. v. Las Vegas\n12 Convention & Visitors Auth. , 913 F. Supp. 1402, 1412 (D. Nev. 1996) (recognizing a\n13 substantial governmental interest in regulating economic development where the government\n14 was engaged in “a permitted commercial activity”); cf. One World One Family Now v. City\n15 & Cnty. of Honolulu, 76 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that the lower court found\n16 that “protecting the local merchant economy” was a “legitimate governmental interest[]”).\n17 The Court finds that Arizona has asserted several substantial governm ental interests that\n18 animate A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B), including the one on which Defendants principally\n19 rely, traffic safety. \n20 c. Direct Advancement of Interest\n21 Turning to the third element of the commercial speech test, the Court next considers\n22 whether the government’s interest is directly advanced by the challenged provisions.\n23 Defendants argue that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) “directly advance Arizona’s interest in\n24 traffic safety by prohibiting in-street employment solicitation that blocks or impedes traffic.”\n25 (Defs.’ Resp. at 10.) Defendants assert that when people solicit employment in the street, it\n26\n27\n4 Although Defendants name these four interests, they only argue with respect to one:\n28 traffic safety.\n- 7 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 8 of 13\n1 creates a particularly grave traffic safety problem. (Id. at 2-3; see also, e.g., Doc. 470, Defs.’\n2 Resp. to 2d PI Mot., Ex. E ,Decl. of Cory L. Braddock, Exs. 3, 4.) Plaintiffs do not argue that\n3 the regulations do not directly advance the government interest in promoting traffic safety.\n4 A regulation “may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the\n5 government’s purpose.” Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564. This inquiry focuses on whether the\n6 regulation advances the governmental interest in its general application, not specifically with\n7 respect to a particular speaker. See Vanguard Outdoor, LLC v. City of L.A., 648 F.3d 737,\n8 742-43 (9th Cir. 2011). In other words, is the ordinance impermissibly underinclusive? See\n9 Metro Lights, LLC v. City of L.A., 551 F.3d 898, 907 (9th Cir. 2009). \n10 A ban on speech or activity “may be constitutionally underinclusive under Central\n11 Hudson when it has exceptions that undermine and counteract that interest the government\n12 claims it has adopted the law to further b ecause such a regulation  cannot directly and\n13 materially advance its aim.” Vanguard, 648 F.3d at 742 (quotations and citation omitted).\n14 Such a regulation is barred in two situations: “(1) first, if the exception ensures that the\n15 regulation will fail to achieve its end, it does no tmaterially advance its aim; and (2) second,\n16 exceptions that make distinctions among different kinds of speech must relate to the interest\n17 the government seeks to advance.”  Id. In Metromedia, the Supreme Court rejected the\n18 argument that the city “denigrate[d] its interest in traffic safety and beauty and defeat[ed] its\n19 own case by permitting onsite advertising and other specified signs” while banning offsite\n20 advertising. Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 510-11. The Supreme Court concluded that the law’s\n21 non-application to one type of sign, offsite advertising, did not alter the direct relation\n22 between the city’s goals and the ban’s application to those signs. Id. at 511.\n23 The Court finds that here, as in Metromedia, the fact that A.R.S. § 13-2928 (A) and\n24 (B) only limit solicitation of employment and not other types of solicitation does not weaken\n25 the link between the ban and Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.S ee id. at 509 (“‘We would\n26 be trespassing on one of the most intensely local and specialized of all municipal problems\n27 if we held that this regulation had no relation to the traffic problem  of New York City.’”\n28 (quoting Ry. Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 109 (1949))). Arizona may elect to\n- 8 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 9 of 13\n1 privilege other kinds of solicitation above em ployment solicitation. See id. at 512; Metro\n2 Lights, 551 F.3d at 911. Even though the ban is content-based and by logical extension\n3 underinclusive to some degree, it still bans a significant amount of solicitation that would\n4 theoretically take place if permitted and thereby directly advances the traffic safety goal.\n5 Significantly, A.R.S. § 13-2928 (A) and (B) ban solicitation of employment only where that\n6 solicitation impedes traffic. The third element of the commercial speech test is satisfied.\n7 d. Drawn to Achieve Governmental Interest\n8 As explained above, Sorrell modified the commercial speech test originally set forth\n9 in Central Hudson by holding that a content-based restriction on commercial speech must\n10 be “drawn to achieve” a substantial governm ental interest. 131 S. Ct. at 2667-68. “There\n11 must be a fit between the legislature’s end sand the means chosen to accomplish those ends.”\n12 Id. at 2668 (quotation and citation om itted). The pre-Sorrell version of this elem ent,\n13 contained in the Central Hudson test, is “substantially similar” to the time, place, and manner\n14 restrictions for content-neutral speech. Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fo,x 492 U.S. 469,\n15 477 (1989) (quotation and citation omitted); see also Moser v. F.C.C. 46 F.3d 970, 973 (9th\n16 Cir. 1995). The Central Hudson test does not require that the government employ the least\n17 restrictive means of advancing its interest. Bd. of Trs., 492 U.S. at 477. But the Suprem e\n18 Court required that the means be narrowly tailored to the end, even beforeS orrell tightened\n19 the test for content-based bans on commercial speech. Id. at 480.\n20 The Court finds that Defendants have not shown that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B),\n21 which  are content-base d  restrictions  of speech, are drawn to achieve the substantial\n22 governmental interest in traffic safety. As an initial matter, because the regulation is content-\n23 based and applies only to solicitation of em ployment, not other types of solicitation, it\n24 appears to be structured to target particular speech rather than a broader traffic problem. See\n25 Metro Lights, 551 F.3d at 905 n.8 (observing that underinclusivity is relevant to both the\n26 third and fourth prongs of theC entral Hudson analysis). The adoption of a content-based ban\n27 on speech indicates that the legislature did notd raft these provisions after careful evaluation\n28 of the burden on free speech. See Discovery Network, 507 U.S. at 417, 428-30.\n- 9 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 10 of 13\n1 “[T]he existence of obvious, less burdensome alternatives is ‘a relevant consideration\n2 in determining whether the “fit” between ends and means is reasonable.’” Berger v. City of\n3 Seattle, 569 F.3d 1029, 1041 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Discovery Network, 507 U.S. at 417\n4 n.13); see also Ballen v. City of Redmond , 466 F.3d 736, 743-44 (9th Cir. 2006). Here,\n5 numerous other traffic regulations are already in place in Arizona to “directly address traffic\n6 and safety without restricting speech.” (See 3d PI Mot. at 6 (citing A.R.S. §§ 13-2906(A),\n7 28-873(A), 28-905).) For example, civil penalties exist for stopping or parking a car in such\n8 a way that it impedes traffic. A.R.S. § 28-873(A). It is also unlawful to open a door on a\n9 motor vehicle if it interferes with traffic, and a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail may be\n10 imposed if a person “recklessly interferes with the passage of any highway or public\n11 thoroughfare by creating an unreasonable inconvenience or hazard.”I d. §§ 13-2906(A), 28-\n12 905; see also id. §§ 13-707(A), 28-704(A), 28-871(A) (other pre-existing traffic and\n13 misdemeanor restrictions on impeding traffic that encompass the behavior targeted by A.R.S.\n14 § 13-2928(A) and (B)).5 \n15 The Court also notes that S.B. 1070 contains a purposes clause that is relevant to this\n16 analysis. Section 1 of S.B. 1070, which has no A.RS.. citation, states that “the intent of [S.B.\n17 1070] is to m ake attrition through enforcem ent the public policy of all state and local\n18 government agencies in Arizona” and that “[t]he provisions of this act are intended to work\n19 together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry a nd presence of aliens and economic\n20 activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States.” Section 1 also states that “there\n21 is  a com pelling  interest in the cooperative enforcem ent  of federal im migration  laws\n22 throughout all of Arizona.” This purposes clause applies to all sections of S.B. 1070, and\n23 nowhere does it state that a purpose of the statutes and statutory revisions is to enhance\n24 traffic safety. Rather, A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B), like the other parts of S.B. 1070, are\n25\n26 5 The fact that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) are additions to Title 13, Arizona’s\nCriminal Code, rather than Chapter 3 of Title 28 of  the A.R.S., which governs traffic and\n27\nvehicle regulation, also undermines an argument that these provisions are actually “drawn\n28 to” address a traffic safety problem.\n- 10 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 11 of 13\n1 explicitly intended “to make attrition through enforcement the public policy of all state and\n2 local government agencies in Arizona” and “to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and\n3 presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States.”\n4 The fact that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) were created as part of a package of statutes and\n5 revisions aimed at perceived problems related to unlawful immigration also weighs against\n6 a finding that the provisions are “drawn to” address a traffic problem. \n7 The  commercial  speech test “ensure[s]   not only that the State’s interests are\n8 proportional to the resulting burdens placed on speech but also that the law does not seek to\n9 suppress a disfavored message.” Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2668. Because A.R.S. § 13-2928(A)\n10 and (B) are not drawn to achieve Arizona’s goal of promoting traffic safety, the Court finds\n11 that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the First\n12 Amendment bars these provisions.\n13 C. Irreparable Harm\n14 The  Supreme  Court has repeatedly recognized the “basic doctrine of equity\n15 jurisprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the moving party has an adequate\n16 remedy at law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.”  Younger v.\n17 Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43-44 (1971). Thus Plaintiffs have the burden to establish that, absent\n18 a preliminary injunction, there is a likelihood–not just a possibility–tha t they will suffer\n19 irreparable harm. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20-21. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated\n20 “‘that an alleged constitutional infringement will often alone constitute irreparable harm.’”\n21 Monterey Mech. Co. v. Wilson , 125 F.3d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting  Assoc. Gen.\n22 Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. Equal,. 950 F.2d 1401, 1412 (9th Cir. 1991)). In\n23 the free speech context, the Supreme Court has held that “[t]he loss of First Amendment\n24 freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”\n25 Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); accord Klein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d\n26 1196, 1207-08 (9th Cir. 2009).\n27 The record contains evidence showing that the individual day laborer Plaintiffs and\n28 day laborer members of some of the organizational Plaintiffs are being chilled from soliciting\n- 11 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 12 of 13\n1 day labor. (See 3d PI Mot. at 12; see also id., Ex. 2, Decl. of Alison J. Harrington ¶¶ 10-11;\n2 3d PI Mot., Ex. 3, Decl. of Tupac Enrique ¶¶ 10-13.) The Court has concluded that Plaintiffs\n3 are likely to succeed on the m erits of their First Am endment challenge to A.R.S. § 13-\n4 2928(A) and (B), and that conclusion, when coupled with Plaintiffs’ evidence regarding the\n5 chilling of individuals’ solicitation of day labor, demonstrates that Plaintiffs are likely to\n6 suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.\n7 D. The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest\n8 The Court considers the final two elements of the preliminary injunction test together.\n9 Plaintiffs have the burden to show that the balance of equities tips in their favor and that a\n10 preliminary injunction is in the public inte rest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. “A prelim inary\n11 injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.” Id. at 24. “In each case,\n12 courts ‘must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each\n13 party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief,’” paying particular attention to\n14 the public consequences. Id. (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, Alaska, 480 U.S.\n15 531, 542 (1987)).\n16 Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they have a significant interest in exercising their\n17 First Amendment rights, as explained above. Noto nly is the exercise of free speech a crucial\n18 civil right, Plaintiffs have shown that they and their m embers are being chilled from\n19 soliciting employment by the threat of enforcem ent of A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B).\n20 Defendants assert a countervailing interest “in the safety of [Arizona’s ]streets and reducing\n21 the crime, intimidation, and property destruction that result[ ] when large groups of day\n22 laborers congregate in and along the roadside.” (Defs.’ Resp. at 17.) The Court finds that,\n23 while Defendants’ interest is significant, the balance of hardships tips in Plaintiffs’ favor.\n24 Defendants have not shown that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) a re drawn to achieve\n25 Arizona’s goal of ensuring traffic safety or any of the other specified governemntal interests.\n26 On the other hand, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that individual Plaintiffs and emmbers\n27 of organizational Plaintiffs are being directly impacted by the threat of enforcement under\n28 these provisions. Given the strong protection traditionally accorded to First Am endment\n- 12 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 604   Filed 02/29/12   Page 13 of 13\n1 rights and considering all the evidence in ther ecord, the Court concludes that the balance of\n2 the equities favors Plaintiffs. \n3 The public interest inquiry primarily focuses on the impact on non-parties, as opposed\n4 to parties. Sammartano v. First Jud. Dist. Ct., 303 F.3d 959, 974 (9th Cir. 2002). “Courts\n5 considering requests for preliminary injunctions have consistently recognized the significant\n6 public interest in upholding First Amendment principles.” Id. (collecting cases). Here, as in\n7 other cases implicating freedom of speech, continuing enforcement of a regulation that likely\n8 violates the First Ame ndment would infringe not only the rights of Plaintiffs and their\n9 members, but also of other day laborers and potential employers. Defendants have not shown\n10 a competing public interest that is compelling enough to outweigh the public interest in a free\n11 exchange of ideas. Cf. Hale v. Dep’t of Energy, 806 F.2d 910, 918 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding\n12 that the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights were outweighed by the government’s interest in\n13 the safety and security of a nuclear testing site)I.t  is not in the public interest to enforce a law\n14 that likely violates the First Amendment. This factor, too, favors Plaintiffs.\n15 III. CONCLUSION\n16 Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the emrits of their claim\n17 that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) violate the First Amendment. Plaintiffs have also shown\n18 that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, that the balance\n19 of equities tips in their favor, and that the public interest favors injunctive relief.\n20 IT  IS THEREFORE ORDERED  granting  Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for\n21 Preliminary Injunction of A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) (Doc. 510).\n22 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED preliminarily enjoining Defendants from enforcing\n23 A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B). \n24 DATED this 29th day of February, 2012.\n25\n26\n27\n28\n- 13 -",

United States, the Supreme Court addressed the preemption claims \n7 \nthat the United States brought against four sections of S.B. 1070—§§ 3, 5(C), 6, and \n8 \n2(B)—in this Court.  No. 11-182, __ U.S. __ (June 25, 2012) (slip op. available at \n9 \nhttp://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf).  The Supreme Court \n10 \naffirmed this Court’s injunction against §§ 3, 5(C), and 6.  On the fourth provision—§ \n11 \n2(B)—the Supreme Court found that an injunction was not appropriate based on the record \n12 \nbefore it, but explicitly preserved the possibility that § 2(B) could be enjoined in another \n13 \naction, and identified clear boundaries that § 2(B) may not lawfully cross. \n14 \n  Plaintiffs brought many of the same preemption claims as the United States, \n15 \nincluding the claims that have invalidated §§ 3, 5(C), and 6.  But this action involves \n16 \nadditional claims, evidence, and irreparable injuries beyond what the Supreme Court had \n17 \nbefore it in Arizona.  In light of those claims, evidence, and injuries and the Supreme \n18 \nCourt’s guidance in Arizona, Plaintiffs bring this Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which \n19 \npresents three issues: \n20 \nFirst, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction against § 2(B) of S.B. 1070 on \n21 \npreemption and Fourth Amendment grounds.  The Supreme Court stated that if police \n22 \nextend detentions for status verification or other immigration purposes under § 2(B), that \n23 \nwill “raise constitutional concerns . . . [a]nd . . . disrupt the federal framework.”  Arizona, \n24 \nslip op. at 2.  The Court declined to “assume” that § 2(B) would be implemented in such a \n25 \nmanner based on the record before it.  Id. at 24.  Plaintiffs here submit additional evidence \n26 \ndemonstrating that § 2(B) will be implemented in precisely the manner that the Supreme \n27 \nCourt deemed unconstitutional thereby irreparably harming any individuals subject to \n28 \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 16 of 65\n \n1 \nillegal detentions.  Given this new evidence, Plaintiffs can establish a likelihood of success \n2 \nor serious questions going to the merits of these claims.  Therefore, § 2(B) can and should \n3 \nbe preliminarily enjoined—at least until the Arizona Supreme Court definitively interprets \n4 \nthe provision in a way that forecloses unconstitutional implementation, which it could do \n5 \non certification from this Court. \n6 \n  Second, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction against § 2(B) of S.B. 1070 based \n7 \non their Equal Protection Clause claim.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating \n8 \nthat § 2(B) violates the Equal Protection Clause because racial or national origin \n9 \ndiscrimination was a motivating factor in its enactment.  Even though merits discovery has \n10 \nbeen stayed in this case, there is already substantial evidence in each of the categories \n11 \nenumerated in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development \n12 \nCorporation, 429 U.S. 252 (1977), which is probative of discriminatory intent.  And while \n13 \nthe evidence on this motion supports a finding of discriminatory intent, at this stage this \n14 \nCourt need only find a likelihood of success or serious questions going to the merits of this \n15 \nclaim. \n16 \n  Third, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction against A.R.S. § 13-2929 on \n17 \npreemption grounds.  The Supreme Court’s analysis of §§ 3 and 5(C) further clarifies that \n18 \n§ 13-2929, the state harboring crime created by § 5 of S.B. 1070, is both field and conflict \n19 \npreempted.  Plaintiffs did not specifically seek a preliminary injunction against this portion \n20 \nof § 5 in their initial motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Court has not addressed \n21 \nfield or conflict preemption challenges to this provision in either this case or in the U.S. \n22 \ncase (No. 2:10cv1413).  Given the unanimous disapproval of similar harboring laws by \n23 \nother federal courts and the Supreme Court’s recent decision, Plaintiffs are likely to \n24 \nsucceed in showing that § 13-2929 is preempted. \n25 \nThe requested injunction would protect the individual Plaintiffs and members of \n26 \nPlaintiff organizations from irreparable harm, including the harms of unlawful detention \n27 \nand arrest under § 2(B) and § 13-2929; prosecution under § 13-2929; and the stigma \n28 \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 17 of 65\n \n1 \nimposed by the racial and national origin discrimination underlying § 2(B).  These harms \n2 \nto individuals and organizations were not before the Supreme Court in Arizona.  The \n3 \npublic interest will likewise be served by the suspension of provisions that threaten \n4 \nfundamental constitutional rights, disrupt the nation’s ability to speak with one voice on \n5 \nimmigration matters, and embody racial and national origin animus.  Accordingly, \n6 \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant the preliminary injunction they seek.  As \n7 \nto § 2(B), as discussed below, Plaintiffs alternatively request that the Court grant \n8 \nPlaintiffs’ request for certification of questions concerning § 2 to the Arizona Supreme \n9 \nCourt and preliminarily enjoin § 2(B) pending the results of such certification. \n10 \nARGUMENT \n11 \nOrdinarily, “[a] plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is \n12 \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n13 \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in \n14 \nthe public interest.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \n15 \n Where “the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor,” the plaintiff need \n16 \nonly “demonstrate[] . . . that serious questions going to the merits were raised” to justify \n17 \nan injunction.  Alliance of the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. \n18 \n2011).  Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction under either standard.   \n19 \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Succeed on the Merits \n20 \nA. Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prove That § 2(B) Is Preempted by Federal Law \n21 \nand Violates the Fourth Amendment \n22 \nIn Arizona, although the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s ruling on § \n23 \n2(B), the Supreme Court did not hold that § 2(B) is constitutional; indeed, the Court \n24 \nexplicitly preserved the possibility that § 2(B) could be enjoined in another action.  \n25 \nArizona, slip op. at 24.  And the Supreme Court outlined the showing that would be \n26 \nsufficient to hold § 2(B) preempted by federal law: \n27 \nDetaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise \n28 \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 18 of 65\n \n1 \nconstitutional concerns.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 333 \n2 \n(2009); Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005) (“A seizure that is \n3 \njustified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can \n4 \nbecome unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to \n5 \ncomplete that mission”).  And it would disrupt the federal framework to put \n6 \nstate officers in the position of holding aliens in custody for possible \n7 \nunlawful presence without federal direction and supervision.  Cf. Part IV–C, \n8 \nsupra (concluding that Arizona may not authorize warrantless arrests on the \n9 \nbasis of removability).  The program put in place by Congress does not \n10 \nallow state or local officers to adopt this enforcement mechanism. \n11 \nId. at 22.   \n12 \nThus, if § 2(B) allows detention for immigration status verification, it is preempted \n13 \nby federal law and raises other constitutional concerns.  And this Court has previously \n14 \nfound in this case that both the first and second sentences of § 2(B) would, on their face, \n15 \ncause such detention, based on their plain language and the evidence in the record \n16 \nregarding the length of immigration status checks.  Doc #447 at 35-38. \n17 \nWithout addressing that finding, however, the Supreme Court indicated that “§ 2(B) \n18 \ncould be read to avoid these concerns,” because “state courts may conclude that, unless the \n19 \nperson continues to be suspected of some crime for which he may be detained by state \n20 \nofficers, it would not be reasonable to prolong [a] stop,” Arizona, slip op. at 22, and one \n21 \ncould also read the second sentence of § 2(B) “as an instruction to initiate a status check \n22 \nevery time someone is arrested, or in some subset of those cases, rather than as a command \n23 \nto hold the person until the check is complete no matter the circumstances.”  Id. at 23.  In \n24 \nsum, on the record before the Court, “[t]here [was] a basic uncertainty about what the law \n25 \nmeans and how it can be enforced.”  Id. at 24. \n26 \nIn this action, and on this record, however, there is not a “basic uncertainty” \n27 \nregarding the implementation of § 2(B).  Plaintiffs present evidence establishing that \n28 \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 19 of 65\n \n1 \nmultiple law enforcement agencies in the state intend to enforce § 2(B) in a way that \n2 \ncrosses the line the Supreme Court drew.  Thus, this Court need not “assume” based on the \n3 \nstatutory language that § 2(B) will extend stops and detentions.  Instead, evidence not in \n4 \nthe record in Arizona shows that § 2(B) will extend detentions and Plaintiffs are, \n5 \naccordingly, substantially likely to prevail on their claims that § 2(B) is preempted and \n6 \nthat it violates the Fourth Amendment. \n7 \nBecause Plaintiffs also meet the remaining elements of the preliminary injunction \n8 \nstandard, see infra Part II, Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction against § 2(B).  \n9 \nAt a minimum, this Court should obtain a definitive interpretation of § 2(B) as to the \n10 \ndetention issue by certifying relevant questions to the Arizona Supreme Court, and issue a \n11 \npreliminary injunction to maintain the status quo pending the Arizona Supreme Court’s \n12 \nresponse. \n13 \n1.  Arizona Law Enforcement Agencies Will Extend Detentions Under § \n14 \n2(B) \n15 \nThe evidence establishes that, notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s ruling, Arizona \n16 \nlaw enforcement will interpret § 2(B) as requiring them to extend stops and other \n17 \ndetentions beyond when they would ordinarily conclude, solely for immigration-related \n18 \npurposes.  As an initial matter, while the Supreme Court held that the language of § 2(B) \n19 \ncould conceivably be interpreted not to require extended detentions, interpreting § 2(B) to \n20 \nmandate detention is the most natural reading of the statute.  Indeed, that is how Arizona \n21 \nagencies have continued to interpret § 2(B).  Nothing in the state’s newly reissued training \n22 \nmaterials on S.B. 1070 indicates that § 2(B) cannot be used to extend detentions solely for \n23 \nimmigration purposes, nor do these materials set any limit on the length of time an \n24 \nindividual can be held pending the results of immigration verification requests.  See Br. for \n25 \nPls., United States v. Arizona, No. 10-1413 (Doc. 64-5, Ex. 35) (transcript of AZ POST \n26 \ntraining video); Melissa Keaney Decl. (authenticating June 25, 2012 supplemental AZ \n27 \nPOST training) (Ex. A).  Moreover, in the short amount of time since the Supreme Court \n28 \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 20 of 65\n \n1 \nruled, multiple Arizona law enforcement officials have publicly stated that implementation \n2 \nof § 2(B) will in fact cause officers to detain individuals for immigration status verification \n3 \nwhen they would not otherwise have been detained.1 \n4 \nIn a declaration submitted with this motion, Tucson Police Chief Roberto \n5 \nVillaseñor explains some of the problems posed by § 2(B) in detail, including the way that \n6 \npolice operating under § 2(B) will extend detention solely for immigration purposes.  \n7 \nVillaseñor Decl. ¶¶ 4-9 (Ex.  D).  In particular, Chief Villaseñor outlines two common \n8 \nscenarios in which § 2(B) will extend detentions.  Id. ¶¶ 8-10.  First, the Tucson Police \n9 \nDepartment currently makes approximately 36,000 “cite in lieu of detention” arrests per \n10 \nyear.  Id. ¶ 8.  The Chief states that “[u]nder Section 2(B) if we cannot get immediate \n11 \nconfirmation from federal officials of the immigration status of these suspects, we will \n12 \nhave to extend their detentions in the field until we get a status determination from federal \n13 \nofficials, or book them into jail to await these results.  Id.  Either situation will result in \n14 \nextended detention of thousands of individuals—even if it is for brief periods of time.”  Id. \n15 \n¶ 9. \n16 \nSecond, Chief Villaseñor expects that “status checks under Section 2(B) will  \n17 \noperate the following way, both in my department and in other departments: once we make \n18 \nthe request mandated under Section 2(B), we will wait to hear back from federal \n19 \nimmigration officials before releasing the person.”  Id. ¶ 10.  That too will extend \n20 \ndetentions, especially in light of the fact that the private cause of action authorized in § \n21 \n2(H) will put “Arizona law enforcement officers . . . under intense pressure to enforce the \n22 \nprovisions of SB 1070,” undermining the effectiveness of protections that putatively \n23 \nsafeguard constitutional rights.  Id. ¶¶ 6-7.     \n24 \nOther Arizona law enforcement officials have also indicated that § 2(B) will extend \n25                                                   \n1 Indeed, both this Court, United States v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d 980, 993-98 (D. Ariz. \n26  2010), and the Ninth Circuit, United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d 339, 346-52 (9th Cir. \n2011), found that to be a natural interpretation of the statute.  And, even in oral argument \n27  before the Supreme Court, the state repeatedly refused to represent that § 2(B) would not \nextend detentions in practice.  Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, 14-15, 20, Arizona v. \n28  United States, No. 11-182, __ U.S. ___ (June 25, 2012).   \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 21 of 65\n \n1 \ndetentions for status verification.  For example, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Antonio \n2 \nEstrada explained that § 2(B) “may result in detention of people while citizenship is \n3 \nclarified” and noted that some geographic regions in Arizona would be more susceptible to \n4 \nthese extended detentions.

B-3).  \n14 \nIndeed, at least one Arizona law enforcement official has not only indicated that \n15 \nstops will be prolonged, but has also indicated that he will use detentions under § 2(B) in \n16 \nways that conflict with federal authority.  Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever indicated \n17 \nthat his agency will extend detentions for immigration purposes even as to people that \n18 \n“ICE or Border Patrol won’t come get”; his agency will “take them to [federal authorities], \n19 \ndump them on their doorstep and say, you figure it out.”  Sean Hannity, Arizona Law \n20 \nEnforcement Reacts to Supreme Court Immigration Ruling, White House Response, Fox \n21 \nNews television broadcast, June 25, 2012 (Ex. B-4). \n22 \nFinally, immediately after the Supreme Court decision, Maricopa County Sheriff \n23 \nJoe Arpaio indicated that he will look for ways to detain people that he suspects of \n24 \nviolating immigration law: “[I]t will be interesting when we arrest someone . . . What will \n25 \nI do with them?  Dump them on the street? . . .  Let them go? . . . I don’t like to do that \n26 \n[because] that’s amnesty . . . I’m going to see what other options I have.”  Neil Munro, \n27 \nArpaio Looking for ‘A Way Around’ Obama Admin To Enforce State [immigration] \n28 \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 22 of 65\n \n1 \nLaws, The Daily Caller, June 27, 2012 (Ex.

See also Erin Burnett, Outfront, \n2 \nSupreme Court Upholds Key Arizona Provision; Interview with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, CNN \n3 \ntelevision broadcast, June 25, 2012 (“So what do we [law enforcement] do?  We dump \n4 \nthem on the streets even though they’re here illegally? . . . I have a couple ideas and I’ll \n5 \nface that issue when it comes up.” (Ex. B-6).  \n6 \n2.  Plaintiffs Are Substantially Likely to Prevail on Their Claim That § 2(B) \n7 \nIs Preempted by Federal Law \n8 \nBecause, as explained above, § 2(B) will allow detention solely for immigration \n9 \nverification, Arizona explains that it “disrupt[s] the federal framework” and is not allowed \n10 \nby “the program put in place by Congress”—in other words, it is preempted.  Slip op. at \n11 \n22.  The Supreme Court’s disapproval of extended detention for verification under § 2(B) \n12 \nflows directly from its analysis sustaining the injunction against § 6, S.B. 1070’s \n13 \nwarrantless arrest provision.  In its § 6 analysis, the Supreme Court first explained that \n14 \nbecause ordinarily “it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States,” \n15 \n“the usual predicate for an arrest is absent” if the arrest is based on “nothing more than \n16 \npossible removability.”  Id. at 15-16.  Furthermore, federal law both “instructs when it is \n17 \nappropriate to arrest an alien during the removal process” and “specifies limited \n18 \ncircumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of an immigration \n19 \nofficer.”  Id. at 16-17 (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1357(g)(1), 1103(a)(10), 1252c, 1324(c)).  In \n20 \nauthorizing arrest for having “committed a public offense that makes the person \n21 \nremovable,” § 6 does not fall within any of those authorizations and “violates the principle \n22 \nthat the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government.”  Id. at \n23 \n18. \n24 \nDetention solely for the purpose of obtaining immigration status verification under \n25 \n§ 2(B) is even less justifiable than arrest under § 6 (which required at least probable cause \n26 \nof removability) and is even more clearly preempted under the Supreme Court’s analysis.  \n27 \nSee id. at 22 (citing § 6 portion of ruling and concluding that detention under § 2(B) for \n28 \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 23 of 65\n \n1 \nstatus verification is barred by “[t]he program put in place by Congress”).  Because, as \n2 \nexplained above, the evidence shows that Arizona officials intend to enforce § 2(B) in a \n3 \nway that extends detentions solely for verification purposes, Plaintiffs are substantially \n4 \nlikely to prevail on their preemption claim against § 2(B). \n5 \n3.  Plaintiffs Are Substantially Likely to Prevail on Their Claim That § 2(B) \n6 \nViolates the Fourth Amendment \n7 \nIn addition to being preempted, by allowing detention for immigration status \n8 \nverification § 2(B) also violates the Fourth Amendment.  In Arizona, the Supreme Court \n9 \nstated that such detention “would raise constitutional concerns,” the Supreme Court cited \n10 \ntwo Fourth Amendment cases, Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 333 (2009), and Illinois \n11 \nv. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005), and quoted Caballes’s holding that “[a] seizure that \n12 \nis justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become \n13 \nunlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission.”  \n14 \nArizona, slip op. at 22. \n15 \nAs the Court’s statement regarding “constitutional concerns” suggests, detaining \n16 \nindividuals under § 2(B) solely for immigration status verification would violate bedrock \n17 \nFourth Amendment principles.  An initially lawful “seizure becomes unlawful when it is \n18 \n‘more intrusive than necessary.’”  Ganwich v. Knapp, 319 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) \n19 \n(quoting Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 504 (1983)). Accordingly, “[t]he scope of a \n20 \ndetention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification,” id. (internal quotation \n21 \nomitted), and a “detention must . . . last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the \n22 \npurpose of the stop.”  Royer, 460 U.S. at 500 (emphasis added); accord Johnson, 555 U.S. \n23 \nat 333 (inquiries into matters unrelated to the legitimate justification for a stop may not \n24 \n“measurably extend the duration of the stop”); Caballes, 543 U.S. at 407; United States v. \n25 \nSharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686 (1985).  Because “the usual predicate for an arrest is absent” \n26 \nwhere detention is “based on nothing more than possible removability,” Arizona, slip op. \n27 \nat 16, detaining individuals solely for immigration investigation under § 2(B) violates the \n28 \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 24 of 65\n \n1 \nFourth Amendment.  \n2 \nMoreover, Plaintiffs here present irreparable injuries to individuals and \n3 \norganizations from Fourth Amendment violations that were not before the Supreme Court \n4 \nin Arizona.  Arizona, slip op. at  19-24 (no discussion of irreparable injury or balance of \n5 \nhardships to individuals or organizations);  See also supra II (discussing irreparable injury \n6 \nand balance of hardship specific to Plaintiffs).  In addition to establishing likelihood of \n7 \nsuccess, Plaintiffs have raised “serious questions” going to the merits of their Fourth \n8 \nAmendment claims and have demonstrated that the balance of hardships tips sharply in \n9 \ntheir favor.  See Alliance for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1135.   \n10 \n4.  At a Minimum, the Court Should Certify the Question of Whether § \n11 \n2(B) Authorizes Additional Detention to the Arizona Supreme Court \n12 \nPlaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction against § 2(B) of S.B. 1070 \n13 \nbecause law enforcement agencies will interpret the Section the same way that this Court \n14 \nand the Ninth Circuit have previously interpreted it—i.e., as authorizing additional \n15 \ndetention for immigration verification purposes.  Plaintiffs recognize, however, that the \n16 \nSupreme Court noted that the Arizona state courts have not yet provided a “definitive \n17 \ninterpretation” of the provision, which could clearly establish that § 2(B) does not allow \n18 \nsuch detention in spite of its plain language.  Arizona, slip op. at 24.  This Court can \n19 \nrequest the definitive interpretation that the Supreme Court lacked by certifying relevant \n20 \nquestions to the Arizona Supreme Court.2  See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, \n21 \n                                                 \n2 In the event that this Court decides to certify to the Arizona Supreme Court, Plaintiffs \n22 \nrespectfully propose the following question: “Does § 2(B) of S.B. 1070 authorize law \n23  enforcement officers to detain an individual, including by extending an individual’s \ndetention beyond the point he or she would otherwise be released, in order to determine or \n24 \nverify the individual’s immigration status?”  Should the Court decide to seek the guidance \n25  of the Arizona Supreme Court as to § 2(B), it would also be appropriate, as a matter of \njudicial economy, to certify a similar question as to § 2(D), namely: “Does § 2(D) of S.B. \n26 \n1070 authorize law enforcement officers to detain an individual, including by extending an \nindividual’s detention beyond the point he or she would otherwise be released, based on \n27 \n‘verification’ that the individual is ‘unlawfully present’?”  Plaintiffs include the question \n28  regarding § 2(D) because, while not currently enjoined, it is also challenged in this \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 25 of 65\n \n1 \n520 U.S. 43, 76 (1997) (“Certification procedure . . . allows a federal court faced with a \n2 \nnovel state-law question to put the question directly to the State’s highest court, reducing \n3 \nthe delay, cutting the cost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative \n4 \nresponse.”); see also A.R.S. § 12-1861 (providing that the Arizona Supreme Court may \n5 \nanswer questions of law certified to it by a United States District Court, where there are \n6 \nissues of Arizona state law that may be determinative of the cause pending with the United \n7 \nStates District Court, and where there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the \n8 \nArizona Supreme Court and intermediate appeals courts of Arizona).   \n9 \nBecause the statute will likely be applied in an unconstitutional manner in the \n10 \nabsence of a definitive ruling limiting § 2(B), if the Court decides to certify, it should \n11 \npreliminarily enjoin § 2(B) on these grounds pending the state court’s response. \n12 \nB. Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prove That § 2(B) Violates the Equal Protection \n13 \nClause \n14 \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their equal protection challenge to SB 1070.  As \n15 \nthe Supreme Court held in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., 429 \n16 \nU.S. 252 (1977), a plaintiff challenging a facially race-neutral law as intentionally \n17 \ndiscriminatory is not required to prove that “the challenged action rested solely on racially \n18 \ndiscriminatory purposes.”  Id. at 265.  Rather, Plaintiffs need only show that unlawful \n19 \ndiscrimination was “a ‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor behind enactment” of S.B. 1070.  \n20 \nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228 (1985).  Once Plaintiffs make a showing of \n21 \ndiscriminatory intent, the burden shifts to Defendants “to demonstrate that the law would \n22 \nhave been enacted without this factor.”  Id.   \n23 \nArlington Heights identified a number of factors that constitute highly relevant and \n24 \nadmissible circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent.  429 U.S. at 266-68.  These \n25 \nfactors include whether: (1) the legislative history, especially contemporaneous statements \n26 \n                                                                                                                                                               \n27  litigation and presents a similar question of statutory interpretation with respect to \ndetention as that presented by § 2(B). \n28   \n3 While this motion focuses on Section 2(B)’s discriminatory intent and disproportionate \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 26 of 65\n \n1 \nby members of the legislature, evidences discrimination; (2) “the historical background” or \n2 \n“sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision” evidences discrimination; (3) \n3 \nthe challenged decision has a disproportionate impact on a protected group; and (4) there \n4 \nwere substantive or procedural departures from usual decision making criteria.  Id.; see \n5 \nalso Comm. Concerning Cmty. Improvement v. City of Modesto, 583 F.3d 690, 703 (9th \n6 \nCir. 2009).  These factors are neither exhaustive nor mandatory, and courts consider them \n7 \nas a whole in determining whether discrimination was a motivating factor for enactment of \n8 \nthe challenged law.  See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268; Tsombanidis v. West Haven \n9 \nFire Dep’t, 352 F.3d 565, 580 (2d Cir. 2003).  It is not necessary to establish each factor to \n10 \nprevail on a discrimination claim.  Cent. Alabama Fair Hous. Ctr. v. Magee, 835 F. Supp. \n11 \n2d 1165, 1186 (M.D. Ala. 2011). \n12 \nThe Arlington Heights factors support a finding of intentional discrimination here.  \n13 \nCf. Magee, 835 F. Supp. 2d at 1197 (finding discriminatory intent motivated Alabama law \n14 \nresembling S.B. 1070).  Discriminatory animus permeated the sequence of events leading \n15 \nup to the passage of S.B. 1070, informed legislators’ views of the law, and ultimately \n16 \nsuffused the entire legislation with anti-Latino and anti-Mexican bias.  Key legislators \n17 \nrelied on invented “facts” about the costs and dangers of “illegal immigration,” conflated \n18 \nLatinos generally or certain U.S. citizen children with “illegal aliens,” and used thinly \n19 \nveiled code words that, in context, plainly reveal a discriminatory motive.  In operation, § \n20 \n2(B) will disproportionately affect persons of color and especially Latinos and individuals \n21 \nof Mexican origin, as population estimates make clear.3  And, the legislature intended § \n22 \n2(B) to implement state-wide Maricopa County practices that had repeatedly resulted in \n23 \n                                                 \n24  3 While this motion focuses on Section 2(B)’s discriminatory intent and disproportionate \nimpact on Latinos and individuals of Mexican national origin, Plaintiffs maintain that § \n25  2(B) also discriminates against other communities of color in Arizona, including its \ndiverse Asian American population that is fast growing and currently makes up about 3.3 \n26  percent of the state’s population.  U.S. Census Bureau, Arizona QuickFacts (Ex. F-6).  \nPlaintiffs will continue to advance their equal protection claim on behalf of all \n27  communities of color as the evidence in the case develops.   \n28 \n \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 27 of 65\n \n1 \nracial profiling complaints and investigations.  Moreover, Arizona’s decision to enact S.B. \n2 \n1070 substantively departed from the legislature’s usual decision-making on public safety \n3 \nissues by restricting police discretion and by enacting an unprecedented private citizen \n4 \ncause of action against police departments regarding their allocation of enforcement \n5 \nresources.  Plaintiffs therefore seek a preliminary injunction of § 2(B) on equal protection \n6 \ngrounds.  \n7 \n1.  The Legislative History of S.B. 1070 Demonstrates a Discriminatory Intent. \n8 \nAs the Supreme Court stated in Arlington Heights, “contemporary statements by \n9 \nmembers of the decisionmaking body” constitute “highly relevant” circumstantial \n10 \nevidence of discriminatory intent.  429 U.S. at 267.  Thus, virtually every case considering \n11 \nan equal protection challenge to a legislative act considers the contemporaneous \n12 \nstatements of public officials, be they in legislative debates, statements to the press, or \n13 \ncampaign materials.  See Magee, 835 F. Supp. 2d at 1187 n.17 (noting that \n14 \n“contemporaneous statements by individual decisionmakers are relevant to determining \n15 \nwhether race was a motivating factor for the decision,” and, in fact, that “where the court’s \n16 \ninquiry centers on finding an improper purpose, looking into legislators’ motives and \n17 \ncomments . . . . is now the norm, not the exception” (collecting cases)).  Plaintiffs need not \n18 \nshow discriminatory motivation by every member, or by a majority, of the decision-\n19 \nmaking body.  See Hunter, 471 U.S. at 228.  And statements made by the sponsor or \n20 \nauthor of a law carry particular weight in establishing legislative intent.  Brock v. Pierce \n21 \nCounty, 476 U.S. 253, 263 (1986); Fed. Energy Admin. v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. \n22 \n548, 564 (1976). \n23 \nThe legislative history of S.B. 1070, and in particular the statements by its \n24 \ncosponsors, Senator Pearce and Representative Melvin, demonstrate that racial and \n25 \nnational origin discrimination was a motivating factor for the enactment of S.B. 1070 and \n26 \n§ 2(B) specifically.   \n27 \n28 \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 28 of 65\n \n1 \ni.  Legislators routinely relied on false or misleading evidence in \n2 \npromoting S.B. 1070, strongly suggesting that their stated reasons \n3 \nwere pretext for unlawful discrimination.  \n4 \nCourts routinely consider misleading statements as evidence of invidious \n5 \ndiscrimination, as it demonstrates that the stated justifications for legislation are mere \n6 \npretext.  See, e.g., Doe v. Village of Mamaroneck, 462 F. Supp. 2d 520, 549, 552 \n7 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (holding that exaggerated, factually unsupported claims regarding the \n8 \nnumber and problems caused by targeted day laborers were “negative and stigmatizing,” \n9 \nproviding “some evidence of racism”); Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr., 648 \n10 \nF. Supp. 2d 805, 814-19 (E.D. La. 2009) (evaluating the city’s proffered justifications for \n11 \nits actions, finding them factually unsupported, and concluding that the challenged \n12 \ngovernmental action therefore was pretextual and an invidious motive could be inferred) \n13 \n(“GNOFHAC II”).   \n14 \nLegislative supporters of SB 1070 cited false or misleading information about \n15 \nundocumented immigrants to justify passage of the law.  In support of S.B. 1070, \n16 \nlegislators relied on assertions about the purported criminality or the alleged costs to \n17 \nArizona due to undocumented immigration.  But, as explained below, those legislators \n18 \nlacked any factual support for those assertions and indeed, some of these legislators’ \n19 \nstatements were based on information that had been widely discredited.4   \n20 \nDuring the legislative debates, Senator Pearce and others routinely cited fabricated \n21 \n“statistics”—particularly about the alleged criminality of undocumented immigrants—to \n22 \njustify the need for S.B. 1070, though they knew that the data was misleading at best, and, \n23 \nin several instances, outright false.  Senator Pearce, for example, claimed that “Phoenix \n24 \nnumber two in the world in kidnappings . . . the home invasion, carjacking, [and] identity \n25 \n                                                 \n26  4 Other Arizona public officials, including Governor Jan Brewer, have similarly relied on \nalleged “facts” in order to support their positions on immigration.  See Brad \n27  Knickerbocker, Jan Brewer Corrects the Record on Headless Bodies in the Desert, \nChristian Science Monitor, Sept. 4, 2010 (discussing Gov. Brewer’s discredited claim that \n28  headless bodies had been found in the Arizona border) (Ex.

Military \n2 \nAffairs and Pub. Safety Comm., Mar. 31, 2010 (Ex.

See, e.g., McCain Says Phoenix is the Second Kidnapping Capital in the World, St. \n5 \nPetersburg Times, June 27, 2010 (investigating the claim in depth, and finding “no \n6 \nevidence that it’s accurate, or even close”) (Ex. B-30).  Similarly, the claims about home \n7 \ninvasions, carjackings and identity theft were factually unsupported and factually \n8 \nunsupportable—which Senator Pearce also knew.  See Phil Gordon, Op-Ed., Time to End \n9 \nSen. Pearce’s Reckless Misstatements, Ariz. Republic, June 27, 2009 (Ex. B-32) \n10 \n(responding to a Pearce op-ed, and stating: “I know how it works for you, senator.  If you \n11 \ntold people the real numbers—verified by the FBI—you’d have no ‘hot-button issue’ and \n12 \nwould risk losing your political base.  But Arizonans expect and trust their elected officials \n13 \nto speak the truth.”). \n14 \nLegislators also used false statistics about murders committed by undocumented \n15 \nimmigrants, with Senator Pearce claiming that “60 % of the homicides in Phoenix involve \n16 \nillegal aliens,” Test. of Sen. Pearce, Debate on S.B. 1070 in H. Military Affairs and Pub. \n17 \nSafety Comm., Mar. 31, 2010 (Ex.

Senator \n19 \nHuppenthal made a similar claim at the press conference to introduce S.B. 1070, stating \n20                                                   \n5 Although Arizona’s legislative debates are not officially transcribed, these are archived in \n21  video form on the Arizona Legislature’s website.

See Email from Sen. \n6 \nPearce dated Oct. 23, 2009 (concluding email by stating that “NO GOVERNMENT \n7 \nAGENCY TRACKS CRIMES BY ILLEGALS – NOT EVEN ATTACKS ON POLICE”) \n8 \n(Ex. E-13).   \n9 \nSenator Pearce also claimed that “a congressional report out called ‘Drawing a Line \n10 \nin the Sand’ by Congressman King” indicated that “9,000 Americans each year [are] killed \n11 \nat the hands of illegal aliens.  25 a day, 12 by stabbing and shooting [and] 13 might be \n12 \nDUI-related crimes.”  Test. of Sen.

The report Senator Pearce was apparently referencing,11 \n14 \nhowever, makes no mention of any statistics even remotely resembling those cited.  These \n15 \nstatistics, moreover—which Pearce frequently cited12—are implausible on their face, as \n16 \nhas been pointed out by the former deputy administrator of the Department of Justice’s \n17 \nOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.

Pearce’s statement that illegal aliens commit 12 murders each day by ‘stabbings and \n2 \nshootings’ would mean that they are responsible for over one-fourth of all homicides \n3 \ncommitted in the United States.  This is an amazing assertion, which leads one to suspect \n4 \nthat Pearce is either making up data or relying on non-objective studies from biased \n5 \ninterest groups.”).   \n6 \nSenator Pearce also cited specious statistics regarding the number of undocumented \n7 \nimmigrant sex offenders contained in a self-published, non-peer reviewed “study” by \n8 \nViolent Crimes Institute.

Here again, the implausibility of these \n12 \n“statistics”—which have been thoroughly debunked13—are obvious, and justifying any \n13 \nlegislation on such grounds demonstrates pretext. \n14 \nii.  Legislators repeatedly conflated Latinos, Spanish-speaking \n15 \nindividuals, and the children of unauthorized immigrants with \n16 \n“illegal aliens,” thereby demonstrating that their attempts to \n17 \npunish and harass “illegal aliens” were also directed at these \n18 \nlarger groups \n19 \nParticularly relevant is evidence that, in discussing the need for the challenged \n20 \naction, the legislative body conflated the protected group (such as Latinos or Mexicans or \n21 \nU.S.-citizen children of undocumented immigrants) with the ostensible target \n22 \n(undocumented immigrants) of the legislation.  In Magee, for example, the court found it \n23                                                   \n13 See, e.g., Gustavo Arellano, Heard Mentality, Phoenix New Times, vol. 32, issue 285 \n24  June 14, 2009 (“Schurman-Kauflin’s based her findings on a 2005 Government \nAccountability Office survey that showed 2 percent of illegals in federal, local or state \n25  prisons had committed a sex crime.  She then applied that percentage to the illegal \nimmigrant population at large—voilà!  Instant endemic perversity!  This statistical sleight-\n26  of-hand, however, withers by employing the very stats she uses.  GAO data for 2003 (the \nmost recent year available) showed about 308,000 criminal aliens (legal as well as illegal \n27  immigrants) were in American prisons; they constitute about 3 percent of the nation’s 12 \nmillion illegal immigrants.  If only 2 percent of incarcerated illegals committed a sex \n28  crime, then it’s intellectually misleading to arrive at the 240,000 figure.”) (Ex. B-37).  \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 32 of 65\n \n1 \nprobative that one of the chief sponsors of the challenged legislation “conflated race and \n2 \nimmigration status,” and that such conflation was racial code supporting a finding of \n3 \ndiscriminatory intent.  835 F. Supp. 2d at 1192; see also id. (discussing how other \n4 \nsupporters of the challenged legislation “frequently conflated illegal immigration and \n5 \nHispanics when discussing the ills to be remedied by [the law]”).   \n6 \nDuring the legislative proceedings on S.B. 1070, legislators frequently conflated \n7 \n“Hispanic” or “Mexican” with “undocumented,” as if members of one of the former two \n8 \ngroups were necessarily members of the last.  During a committee hearing, for example, \n9 \nSenator Pearce asserted that Officer Martin had been murdered by undocumented \n10 \nimmigrants, and in an email Senator Pearce claimed that Officer Eggle had been killed by \n11 \nundocumented immigrants.  See Test. of Sen. Pearce, H. Military Affairs & Pub. Safety \n12 \nComm., Mar. 31, 2010 (Exs. C-3 at 4, E-14).  Although there is evidence that Eggle was \n13 \nkilled by Mexicans, and Martin by a Latino, there is no basis to conclude that the \n14 \nperpetrators were undocumented immigrants.  See Huerta Decl. (Ex. G).  Senator Pearce \n15 \nmade the same and other race- and national origin-based assumptions in asking his fellow \n16 \nlegislators to support SB 1070.  Compare Email from Sen. Pearce dated June 30, 2009 \n17 \n(asserting that various individuals had been killed by undocumented immigrants) (Ex. E-\n18 \n14) with Huerta Decl. (explaining that there is no evidence that several of the alleged \n19 \nperpetrators mentioned by Senator Pearce were undocumented) (Ex. G). \n20 \nSimilarly, a draft letter to be signed by Senators Pearce and Karen Johnson, decried \n21 \n“a huge protest march by 20,000 Hispanics,” asserting without any basis other than the \n22 \nmarchers’ race that “[m]ost of the protestors are not legal citizens, legal residents, or even \n23 \nlegal visitors in our country.  They are illegal.  They have no right to request or demand \n24 \nanything.”  Email from Sen. Pearce dated Apr. 6, 2006 (Ex. E-15)14.  Pearce repeated his \n25 \nrace-based assumption several times over the years.  See, e.g., Email from Sen. Pearce \n26                                                   \n14 See Yvonne Wingett and Susan Carrol, 20,000 in Phoenix Rally for Migrants, Ariz. \n27  Republic, Mar. 25, 2006 (“Tens of thousands of Latinos marched up and down 24th Street \non Friday, protesting federal legislation that would criminalize undocumented \n28  immigrants.”) (Ex. B-38). \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 33 of 65\n \n1 \ndated May 26, 2009 (emailing an article about the arrests of Hispanic gang members with \n2 \nthe subject line: “Hundreds of Hispanic gang members arrested in L.A. for targeting Black \n3 \npeople (worse, is most of these Hispanic gang members are ILLEGAL aliens) Welcome to \n4 \nthe new United States of Mexico”) (Ex.

Pearce dated June 20, 2006 (same) (Ex. E-18).  In another email, Senator \n7 \nPearce asserted, inter alia: “I’m a racist because . . .  I don’t want to be taxed to pay for a \n8 \nprison population comprised of mainly Hispanics, Latinos, Mexicans or whatever else you \n9 \nwish to call them . . .  I object to having to pay higher sales tax and property tax to build \n10 \nmore schools for the illegitimate children of illegal aliens. . .  [I] want to deny citizenship \n11 \nto all anchor babies born in this country pre 2006 and here after . . .  I object to corporation \n12 \nand municipalities spending billions to translate everything in Spanish.”  Email from Sen. \n13 \nPearce dated Dec. 14, 2006 (Ex. E-20). \n14 \nAn email from a member of Senator Karen Johnson’s staff to Senators Pearce and \n15 \nJohnson is especially blatant in conflating race and “illegal” status: it reported that \n16 \n“yesterday (Thursday) was the day that the landscapers come into my subdivision to cut \n17 \nthe grass and clean up the park.  The crew has always been totally Hispanic.  Yesterday \n18 \nthere were two men who were obviously NOT Hispanic –very white and very American \n19 \nlooking—like college kids.  Hooray!  It looks like the illegals are starting to depart.”  \n20 \nEmail to Sens. Pearce & Johnson dated Jul. 6, 2007 (Ex. E-20).   \n21 \nAnother example of this discriminatory conflation is the repeated claim of Senator \n22 \nAl Melvin, who co-sponsored the bill, that “education, incarceration and medication” for \n23 \nundocumented immigrants cost Arizona taxpayers $2 billion per year, referring to “well \n24 \ndocumented” information on the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s \n25 \n(“FAIR”) website.15  See Test. of Sen. Melvin, Final Reading of S.B. 1070, Sen. Floor, \n26 \nApr. 19, 2010 (Ex. C-6 at 15); Test. of Sen. Melvin, S. Pub. Safety & Human Serv. \n27                                                   \n15 Senator Pearce made a similar claim.  See Email from Sen. Pearce to Legislators dated \n28  June 30, 2009 (Ex. E-14). \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 34 of 65\n \n1 \nComm., Jan. 20, 2010 (Ex. C-1 at 9).  But Senator Melvin did not acknowledge or explain \n2 \nwhat had been pointed out publicly by others:16 that many of the “undocumented \n3 \nimmigrants” he blamed for costing Arizona taxpayers billions are in fact native-born \n4 \nUnited States citizens.  Indeed, the costs associated with educating U.S.-citizen children \n5 \nconstitute the majority of the total educational costs (60 percent of the total) Senator \n6 \nMelvin cited. 17  See Jack Martin & Eric A. Ruark, Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, \n7 \nThe Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers 45 (2010).    \n8 \nMoreover, Senator Melvin’s statistics also assume, without support, that a large majority \n9 \nof English as a Second Language (“ESL”) students “may be assumed to be children of \n10 \neither legal or illegal immigrants with a predominance of children of illegal aliens”—at \n11 \nleast in part because the fact that the native language of most ESL students is Spanish.18  \n12 \nSee Jack Martin, Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Limited English Proficiency \n13 \nEnrollment and Rapidly Rising Costs 2 (2007); Martin & Ruark, supra, at 48.19  Thus, the \n14 \nalleged “cost” of illegal immigration Melvin presented was premised, in significant part, \n15 \non assumptions about the immigration status of Spanish speakers, their parents, and the \n16 \ncost of educating U.S. citizens.  \n17 \nAs has been the case elsewhere, “the combination of a lack of evidence [supporting \n18                                                   \n16 See, e.g., Jim Small, Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce: Stemming Illegal \n19  Immigration is Arizona’s Top Priority, Ariz.

B-40). \n21  17 FAIR has produced multiple reports on the alleged costs of undocumented immigrants \nto Arizona over the last several years.  See, e.g., http://www.fairus.org/issue/the-costs-to-\n22  local-taxpayers-for-illegal-aliens; http://www.fairus.org/publications/the-costs-of-illegal-\nimmigration-to-arizonans-2004 (posting 2010 and 2004reports.  Each of these documents \n23  includes the costs associated with citizen children in costs of undocumented immigration.     \n18 This attack on the use of Spanish supports the inference that the Arizona legislature \n24  considered Spanish to be a proxy for illegal immigrants and, by extension, Latinos.  See \nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 371-72 (1991); Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d 264, 268 \n25  (5th Cir. 1980); Farm Labor Org. Comm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 308 F.3d 523, \n539-40 (6th Cir. 2002). \n26  19 The conflation of U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants with undocumented \nimmigrants themselves suggests discriminatory intent against not just undocumented \n27 \nimmigrants, but also against a category of U.S. citizens based largely on their national \n28  origin or ethnicity.   \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 35 of 65\n \n1 \nlegislative assertions] and an assumption of unlawfulness applied to Latinos that is not \n2 \napplied to other groups, especially when buttressed against evidence of the conflation of \n3 \nLatino and ‘illegal immigrant,’ supports an inference of discrimination.”  Magee, 835 F. \n4 \nSupp. 2d at 1194 n.21.   \n5 \niii.  Legislators’ use of camouflaged racial language during the S.B. \n6 \n1070 debate is evidence of discriminatory intent. \n7 \nComments by legislators directly expressing animus based on protected status are, \n8 \nof course, rare, as “officials acting in their official capacities seldom, if ever, announce on \n9 \nthe record that they are pursuing a particular course of action because of their desire to \n10 \ndiscriminate against a racial minority.”  Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055, 1064 \n11 \n(4th Cir. 1982).  Courts therefore examine whether public officials have “camouflaged” \n12 \ninvidious intent by using code words from which, in context, one can infer a \n13 \ndiscriminatory purpose.  See, e.g., id. at 1066 (finding that statements about \n14 \n“undesirables,” and concerns about personal safety due to “new” people were \n15 \n“camouflaged racial expressions”); GNOFHAC II, 648 F. Supp. 2d at 811 (public officials \n16 \ncited “influx of crime” and preserving “shared values” at public hearings, terms the court \n17 \nheld to be “camouflaged racial expressions”); Atkins v. Robinson, 545 F. Supp. 852, 874 \n18 \n(E.D. Va. 1982) (finding statement that she “feared the projects ‘would degenerate to \n19 \nslum-like conditions, with an abundance of crime’” to be a veiled reference to race).20  The \n20 \nNinth Circuit, too, has noted that references to crime, “unless properly limited and \n21 \nfactually based, can easily serve as a proxy for race or ethnicity.”  United States v. \n22 \nMontero-Camargo, 208 F.3d 1122, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000).   \n23 \nThe legislative debate on S.B. 1070 was replete with racially coded language. \n24 \nSenator Ron Gould, for example, spoke of the need to “protect” against “foreign \n25                                                   \n20 See also Rivera v.

Specifically, he referred to \n4 \nwhat he perceived to be the threat and discomfort of Arizona residents from seeing \n5 \n“strange men” “walking around” to solicit work and likened day laborers to “hookers.”  \n6 \nAriz.

Legal residents don’t have to solicit labor on \n11 \nthe street like hookers.”). \n12 \niv.  Statements of legislators who opposed S.B. 1070 further support a \n13 \nfinding of discriminatory intent. \n14 \nStatements of legislators who opposed S.B. 1070–and the reactions of proponents– \n15 \nare also relevant in assessing the discriminatory intent of the legislature.  See, e.g., Greater \n16 \nNew Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. St. Bernard Parish, 641 F. Supp. 2d 563, 570 (E.D. \n17 \nLa. 2009) (“GNOFHAC I”) (chairperson “who voted against the ordinance, said the \n18 \nordinance was racially motivated and was clearly intended to preserve the nearly all-\n19 \nCaucasian demographic of the parish.”).  During the debate on S.B. 1070, several \n20 \nlegislative opponents expressed strong views that S.B. 1070 would lead to racial profiling \n21 \nand targeting of Latinos.  See Test. of Rep.

This is not just if you are Latino or \n9 \nHispanic—anyone of color may be subject to racial profiling”) (Ex. B-42). \n10 \nv.  Discriminatory statements by constituents and the public \n11 \ninfluenced the legislative process and support a finding of \n12 \ndiscriminatory intent.  \n13 \nRacially charged or racially coded statements made by constituents in the media or \n14 \nduring public hearings may also help to establish discriminatory intent, if there is evidence \n15 \nthat those statements influenced legislators.  While “[p]rivate biases may be outside the \n16 \nreach of the law, . . . the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.  ‘Public \n17 \nofficials sworn to uphold the Constitution may not avoid a constitutional duty by bowing \n18 \nto the hypothetical effects of private racial prejudice that they assume to be both widely \n19 \nand deeply held.’”  Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984) (citation omitted); see \n20 \nalso City of Cleburne v.

Courts therefore consider relevant evidence that the \n25 \ndecision-making body considered and acted in response to discriminatory statements by \n26 \nprivate individuals; here, too, courts will look for racially camouflaged statements.  See, \n27 \ne.g., Resident Advisory Bd. v.

During a public hearing on S.B. 1070, a \n9 \nconstituent who testified claimed that S.B. 1070 was necessary because Arizona was \n10 \nsuffering from an “invasion” of “illegal immigrants” and that unchecked immigration was \n11 \n“importing a culture of corruption.

S.B. 1070’s Discriminatory Adverse Impact on Latinos and Mexican \n20 \nNationals Weighs in Favor of a Finding of Discriminatory Intent \n21 \n“[I]mpact of an official action is often probative of why the action was taken in the \n22 \nfirst place since people usually intend the natural consequences of their actions.”  Reno v. \n23 \nBossier Parish Sch.

Courts also routinely consider the \n2 \nforeseeability that the challenged action would have a discriminatory impact in \n3 \ndetermining whether the legislature acted based on a discriminatory intent.  United States \n4 \nv. City of Birmingham, 538 F. Supp. 819, 828 (E.D.

According to the latest U.S. Census figures, approximately \n11 \n67.5 percent of Arizona’s foreign-born population is from Latin America, and 29 percent \n12 \nof the state’s total population is Latino.

The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that in 2008 over 90 percent of \n15 \nunauthorized immigrants in the state were from Mexico.  Id. ¶ 10. \n16 \nIn addition, there is clear evidence that the legislature enacted § 2(B) with the \n17 \nunderstanding that it would not be applied in a racially neutral way.  The legislature \n18 \nenacted S.B. 1070 in the face of testimony and evidence that § 2(B)’s standard—\n19 \n“reasonable suspicion” of unlawful presence—would lead to the profiling of Latinos and \n20 \nthose who appear Mexican.  See Test. of Sen. Aboud, Final Reading of S.B. 1070 in the \n21 \nSenate, Apr. 19, 2010 (Ex.

At the press conference held \n7 \non October 21, 2009 to introduce S.B. 1070, Senator Pearce—the law’s author and \n8 \nprincipal sponsor—explained, together with Sheriff Arpaio himself, that S.B. 1070 would \n9 \nrestore Arpaio’s authority to enforce civil immigration law after the Department of \n10 \nHomeland Security revoked its § 287(g) task force agreement with MCSO.  See Press \n11 \nRelease, Sen.

Senator Pearce also held up Sheriff Arpaio’s \n20 \nagency “as a model for what law enforcement should be doing.”  Editorial, Resist \n21 \nStampede to State Mandates for Immigration Enforcement, Trib. (Mesa, Ariz.), Oct. 23, \n22 \n2009 (Ex. B-14).  Senator Pearce similarly, and repeatedly, linked S.B. 1070 with the \n23 \nArpaio approach to immigration enforcement in emails seeking the support of his fellow \n24 \nlegislators.23   \n25 \n                                                 \n26  23 For example, in a June 30, 2009 email asking his fellow legislators to support his \nforthcoming legislation, Senator Pearce held up Sheriff Arpaio and the MCSO as a model, \n27 \npersonally thanking “Sheriff Joe” and asserting that Arpaio and MCSO “have a proven \n28  track record of enforcing our immigration laws and not caving in to political correctness.”  \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 43 of 65\n \n1 \nYet as Senator Pearce and the entire Arizona legislature knew, Arpaio’s actions—\n2 \nparticularly his immigration enforcement initiatives, which S.B. 1070 was designed to \n3 \npreserve and expand statewide—had spawned numerous federal investigations,24 \n4 \nlawsuits,25 and countless complaints and media stories26 regarding racial profiling and \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                               \n6 \nEmail from Sen. Pearce dated June 30, 2009 (Ex. E-14).  Around the same time, Pearce \nsent another email that again praised the MCSO, this time to rebut the charge that his bill \n7 \ncould lead to racial profiling.  See also Email to Sen.

As a result of Senator \n11 \nPearce’s lobbying—which, as mentioned, explicitly invoked “Sheriff Joe” as a model—26 \nstate representatives and 11 state senators acceded to his request to endorse S.B. 1070.

Indeed, the revocation of MCSO’s 287(g) \n2 \ntask force agreement—the very development that S.B. 1070 was intended to supersede—\n3 \nfollowed the federal Department of Justice’s opening of an investigation into racial \n4 \nprofiling by MCSO and DHS’s determination that “the manner in which [MCSO] \n5 \nconducted those sweeps was not consistent with good coordination and cooperation within \n6 \nthe communities they were operating within.”  Jeremy Duda, Immigration and Customs \n7 \nEnforcement: If Sheriff Arpaio Continues Sweeps, It will be Under State, Not Federal, \n8 \nLaw, Ariz. Capitol Times, Oct. 16, 2009 (Ex. B-22).  Thus, there is substantial evidence \n9 \nnot only that S.B. 1070, and § 2(B) in particular, will have a discriminatory impact, but \n10 \nthat it was also enacted with knowledge and intent that it would operate in a \n11 \ndiscriminatory manner.   \n12 \n3.

All of these efforts have been led by \n3 \nSenator Pearce, the chief architect and sponsor of S.B. 1070.28  In 2005, the legislature \n4 \npassed S.B. 1167, which would have made English the official language of the state and \n5 \n“protect[ed] the rights of persons in [Arizona] who use English.”29  Although vetoed by \n6 \nthen-Governor Janet Napolitano, Pearce was successful in placing the measure on the \n7 \nballot, where it was approved by the Arizona electorate.  See Ariz.

In 1988, the \n26  voters passed Proposition 106, a constitutional amendment establishing English as the \nofficial state language and requiring state employees to use English only in their jobs.  In \n27  1998, the Arizona Supreme Court struck down Proposition 106 as violative of the First \nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Moreover, there is direct evidence that the Arizona legislature \n2 \ngenerally, and Senator Pearce specifically, targeted the use of Spanish as a surrogate for \n3 \nrace and national origin.  See Email from Sen. Pearce dated Jan. 29, 2007 (rebutting the \n4 \n“myth” that “Mexico’s people . . . respect our language” and comparing the importation of \n5 \nSpanish speakers to “importing leper colonies and hop[ing] we don’t catch leprosy”) (Ex. \n6 \nE-8); cf.

E-9).  \n9 \nIn 2010, during the same session in which S.B. 1070 was passed, the Arizona \n10 \nlegislature passed HB 2281, a bill that financially penalizes primary and secondary schools \n11 \nif they provide “any courses or classes that ‘promote resentment toward a race or class of \n12 \npeople,’ ‘are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group,’ or ‘advocate \n13 \nethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.’”31  Although worded \n14 \nneutrally, the so-called “ethnic studies ban” was aimed at one course: the Mexican-\n15 \nAmerican Studies program of the Tucson Unified School District.  See Nicole Santa Cruz, \n16 \nArizona Ethnic Studies Ban OKd as Law, L.A.

Pearce dated Dec. 21, 2008 (Ex. E-10).  Senator Pearce \n5 \nenclosed in his email an overtly jingoistic article warning that Mexican American studies \n6 \nprograms are a slippery slope toward the realization of Atzlán—i.e., the retaking (or \n7 \n“Reconquista”) of the American Southwest by Hispanics, particularly Mexicans.  Id.  \n8 \n(“[T]he Mexican government has embraced the concept of ‘demographic warfare,’ a \n9 \nreconquering of the southwestern United States through unchecked illegal immigration \n10 \nand by exporting its ‘surplus poverty’ to regain control.”).  The anti-Latino and anti-\n11 \nMexican animus animating HB 2281 is deep and self-evident. \n12 \nArizona’s anti-Mexican and anti-Latino animus is not new; the state, unfortunately, \n13 \nhas a long history of such discrimination.

St. L. Rev. 75 \n16 \n(2004).  Indeed, this history of discrimination against Latinos in Arizona has been \n17 \nestablished in recent federal court litigation.  See Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383 (9th \n18 \nCir. 2012) (en banc) (noting that the district court found, in the context of a claim under \n19 \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, “that Latinos had suffered a history of discrimination \n20 \nin Arizona that hindered their ability to participate in the political process fully, that there \n21 \nwere socioeconomic disparities between Latinos and whites in Arizona, and \n22 \nthat Arizona continues to have some degree of racially polarized voting.”).32  This history \n23                                                   \n32 As Judge Pegerson notes, this history includes: “de jure discrimination against Latinos \n24  in Arizona [that] existed during most of the twentieth century. Just prior to 1910, Arizona \nvoters passed a literacy law that explicitly targeted Mexicans and disqualified non-English \n25  speakers from voting in state elections. As late as the 1960s, these literacy requirements \nwere a precondition for voting in Arizona.  After Arizona attained statehood in 1912, the \n26  new state government engaged in an anti-immigrant campaign characterized by a series of \nproposals aimed at restricting the political rights of Mexican immigrants' and limiting their \n27  right to work.

It is especially relevant here because Senator Pearce, in advocating for his anti-\n8 \nimmigrant measures, has explicitly invoked that history of discrimination, for example, by \n9 \ncalling for a reinstatement of the controversial “Operation Wetback” program, which \n10 \ntargeted Mexicans for deportation.

S.B. 1070 Departs Substantively from Established Practice. \n14 \n   Under Arlington Heights, the Court should consider whether S.B. 1070 constituted \n15 \na substantial departure from established practice; such departures are evidence of \n16 \ndiscriminatory intent.  “Substantive departures exist when ‘factors usually considered \n17 \nimportant by the decision-maker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached.”  \n18 \nMagee, 835 F.

Section 2(B) is unprecedented.  No previous statute has required law \n25 \n                                                                                                                                                               \n26  had to be “native-born citizens of the United States.” Gonzalez v.

Indeed, not only \n5 \ndoes S.B. 1070 limit law enforcement’s discretion generally, it redirects their efforts away \n6 \nfrom areas that the legislature generally prioritizes for law enforcement:  investigating and \n7 \ndealing with crimes under Arizona law, particularly those that threaten public safety.

To \n14 \nPlaintiffs’ knowledge, there is no comparable cause of action against law enforcement \n15 \nofficials for failing to enforce a state-law provision in any other Arizona statute, and this \n16 \nprovision will further impinge on law enforcement’s ability to apply their own \n17 \nprofessional judgment to situations they encounter in the field.  Indeed, law enforcement \n18 \nofficers have reacted particularly strongly to this provision, expressing significant \n19 \nconcerns about the potential for lawsuits and the nearly impossible task of defending \n20 \nagainst assertions that their officers acted improperly in not finding requisite “reasonable \n21 \nsuspicion” to trigger the immigration status check required by § 2(B).

Of course, the Court can also issue a \n17 \npreliminary injunction based on equal protection if it finds Plaintiffs have raised “serious \n18 \nquestions going to the merits,” and have demonstrated that a balance of hardships tips \n19 \nsharply in their favor.  See Alliance for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1135 (citation \n20 \nomitted).  Under either standard, a preliminary injunction of § 2(B) on equal protection \n21 \ngrounds is warranted. \n22 \nC. Plaintiffs Are Substantially Likely to Prevail on Their Claim That \n23 \nA.R.S. § 13-2929 Is Preempted by Federal Law \n24 \nIn Arizona, the Supreme Court struck down both state criminal provisions of S.B. \n25 \n1070 that were before the Court: the § 3 state registration crime and the § 5(C) state crime \n26 \npenalizing unauthorized work.  Slip op. at 11, 15.  Plaintiffs address here another provision \n27 \nof § 5, A.R.S. § 13-2929, that likewise creates a new state crime based on alleged \n28 \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 51 of 65\n \n1 \nviolations of federal immigration law—specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1324, the federal harboring \n2 \nstatute.  Although this Court previously declined to enjoin A.R.S. § 13-2929 in the federal \n3 \ngovernment’s case, the federal government’s challenge was based only on the dormant \n4 \ncommerce clause and the claim that § 13-2929 amounts to a regulation of immigration.34  \n5 \nMoreover, at the time that it ruled on the federal motion, the Court did not have the benefit \n6 \nof the Supreme Court’s subsequent elucidation of the relevant preemption doctrine when it \n7 \ndecided the motion.   \n8 \nPlaintiffs now respectfully request that the Court preliminarily enjoin § 13-2929 on \n9 \nthe grounds of field and conflict preemption.  The Supreme Court’s ruling in Arizona and \n10 \nother precedents make it clear that § 13-2929 is invalid on these grounds.35  Indeed, after \n11 \nthe Court dismissed the United States’ challenge to § 13-2929 on other grounds, but before \n12 \nthe Arizona decision, three separate federal district courts have preliminarily enjoined \n13 \nsimilar state transporting and harboring laws on the bases of conflict and/or field \n14 \npreemption.

The \npreemption challenges that Plaintiffs present here are fundamentally distinct from the \n26  government’s challenge.  Plaintiffs raise separate preemption challenges—that A.R.S. § \n13-2929 impermissibly legislates in a field that has been fully occupied by Congress, and \n27  that it conflicts with the federal statutes concerning transporting and harboring.

A.R.S. § 13-2929 Is Field Preempted  \n4 \nThe Supreme Court struck down § 3 of S.B. 1070 because federal law occupies the \n5 \nalien registration field.  Arizona, slip op. at 9-11.  Similarly, Congress has occupied the \n6 \nalien harboring field by enacting 8 U.S.C. § 1324, which is an integral part of Congress’s \n7 \ncomprehensive immigration law.  GLAHR v. Deal, 793 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1336 (N.D. Ga. \n8 \n2011) (finding that a similar provision under Georgia’s law “imposes additional criminal \n9 \nlaws on top of a comprehensive federal scheme”); South Carolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at \n10 \n*13 (8 U.S.C. § 1324 is part of federal scheme “so pervasive that it left no room in this \n11 \narea for the state to supplement it.”). \n12 \nCongress has enacted “a uniform, comprehensive scheme of sanctions,” both “for \n13 \nthose who unlawfully enter the United States” and “for third parties who aid the entry and \n14 \nstay of those who unlawfully enter.”  Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1330-31(citing and \n15 \nsummarizing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1323, 1324, and 1327).  These provisions prohibit the knowing \n16 \nattempt to bring a person into the United States “at a place other than a designated port of \n17 \nentry or place other than as designated by the [Secretary of Homeland Security],” 8 U.S.C. \n18 \n§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(i), and impose criminal penalties on anyone who, “knowing or in reckless \n19 \ndisregard of the fact” that a person has unlawfully entered or remained in the United \n20 \nStates, attempts to “transport or move” the person within the United States “in furtherance \n21 \nof such violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii).   \n22 \nThe provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1324 have broad preemptive effect.  See South \n23 \nCarolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at *13; Villas at Parkside Partners v. City of Farmers \n24 \nBranch, 701 F. Supp. 2d 835, 858-59 (N.D.

Arizona, slip op. at 17 (emphasis added).  The Court made clear, \n5 \nhowever, that states may not exceed such specific authorizations.  Id. at 19; see also \n6 \nAlabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1333-34 (noting that in this area there is no savings clause \n7 \nthat might authorize state activity such as the one at issue in Chamber of Commerce of \n8 \nU.S. v. Whiting, 563 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 1968 (2011)).  In A.R.S. § 13-2929 Arizona goes \n9 \nwell beyond what Congress authorized with respect to harboring—arrest for the federal \n10 \ncrime—by creating its own state criminal scheme.   \n11 \nArizona explains that a state law allowing states to prosecute and punish alleged \n12 \nfederal immigration violations fundamentally conflicts with Congress’s reservation of \n13 \n“broad discretion” over immigration enforcement to federal officials.  Slip op. at 4-5.  As \n14 \nwith alien registration, in the area of the inducement, transportation, and harboring of \n15 \nnoncitizens, the “federal statutory directives provide a full set of standards” that were \n16 \n“designed as a ‘harmonious whole.’”  Id. at 10 (quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at 72).  And as in \n17 \nthe registration field, “[p]ermitting the State to impose its own penalties for the federal \n18 \noffenses here would conflict with the careful framework Congress adopted.”  Id. at 11.    \n19 \n“[T]he State would have the power to bring criminal charges against individuals for \n20 \nviolating a federal law even in circumstances where federal officials in charge of the \n21 \ncomprehensive scheme determine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.”  Id.  \n22 \nFor these reasons, even if A.R.S. § 13-2929 were identical to the federal harboring \n23 \nlaw, which it is not, it would be field preempted.   \n24 \na.  A.R.S. § 13-2929 Is Conflict Preempted \n25 \nWithin the past year, three federal courts have enjoined state harboring, inducing, \n26 \nand transporting statutes similar to § 13-2929 on conflict preemption grounds.  Alabama, \n27 \n813 F. Supp. 2d at 1334-36; South Carolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at *13; GLAHR, 793 F. \n28 \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 54 of 65\n \n1 \nSupp. 2d at 1335-36.  A.R.S. § 13-2929 is similarly conflict preempted.  Specifically, \n2 \nA.R.S. § 13-2929 undermines the congressional scheme by adding additional penalties to \n3 \nexisting federal crimes; relocating decision-making regarding the interpretation and \n4 \nprosecution of these crimes from the federal government to the state without ensuring \n5 \nuniformity; and criminalizing conduct the federal government chose not to sanction. \n6 \nArizona’s harboring provisions are enforced by state police and prosecutors and \n7 \ninterpreted by state judges, not by their federal counterparts, and decisions about when to \n8 \ncharge a person or what penalty to seek are no longer under federal control.  A.R.S. § 13-\n9 \n2929 permits the state to prosecute and impose additional penalties on individuals whom \n10 \nthe federal government has elected not to charge, or those who have already been federally \n11 \ncharged and sentenced by a federal court.  Thus, A.R.S. § 13-2929 authorizes state officers \n12 \nto “use an iron fist where the President has consistently chosen kid gloves.”  Am. Ins. \n13 \nAss’n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 427 (2003).  The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution \n14 \ndoes not permit states to make that decision.  See Arizona, slip op. at 11 (“Permitting the \n15 \nState to impose its own penalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with the \n16 \ncareful framework Congress adopted”).  Such state regulation would “disrupt this \n17 \ncomprehensive federally controlled immigration enforcement scheme by placing state \n18 \nprosecutors in control of enforcement efforts under [the South Carolina provisions] and \n19 \npermitting state judges to interpret the harboring and transporting statutes.”  South \n20 \nCarolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at *12. \n21 \nOf particular relevance here, in Arizona the Supreme Court rejected as  \n22 \n“unpersuasive on its own terms” the argument that a “provision [that] has the same aim as \n23 \nfederal law and adopts its substantive standards” must survive preemption.  Slip op. at 10-\n24 \n11; see also id. at 15 (“Although § 5(C) attempts to achieve one of the same goals as \n25 \nfederal law . . . it involves a conflict in the method of enforcement”); see also Crosby v. \n26 \nNat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 379 (2000) (even if a state law shares the \n27 \nsame goals as the federal law, “[t]he fact of a common end hardly neutralizes conflicting \n28 \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 55 of 65\n \n1 \nmeans”).  Under A.R.S. § 13-2929, Arizona may decide to charge an individual over \n2 \nwhom the federal government has exercised its discretion not to prosecute.  Likewise, \n3 \nArizona prosecutors may pile additional penalties on top of a federal sentence under 8 \n4 \nU.S.C. § 1324, effectively increasing the penalty carefully calibrated by Congress and the \n5 \nfederal justice system.  “[T]his state framework of sanctions creates a conflict with the \n6 \nplan Congress put in place.”  Arizona, slip op. at 11 (citing Wisc. Dept. of Indus., Labor & \n7 \nHuman Relations v. Gould Inc., 475 U.S. 282, 286 (1986), for the proposition that \n8 \n“conflict is imminent whenever two separate remedies are brought to bear on the same \n9 \nactivity” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  By imposing different and additional \n10 \npenalties, A.R.S. § 13-2929 impermissibly “undermines the congressional calibration of \n11 \nforce.” Crosby, 530 U.S. at 380. \n12 \nIn addition, Arizona emphasizes that a small inconsistency between federal and \n13 \nstate laws relating to immigration creates additional conflicts.  Slip op. at 11 (SB 1070 § 3 \n14 \nconflicts because it creates “an inconsistency between [state] and federal law with respect \n15 \nto penalties” by ruling out probation and pardon).  A.R.S. § 13-2929 presents an even \n16 \nmore severe conflict than the Arizona criminal provisions considered by the Supreme \n17 \nCourt because, in addition to potentially imposing different penalties, it prohibits a \n18 \ndifferent (and broader) range of conduct than the federal harboring law.  A.R.S. § 13-2929 \n19 \npunishes encouraging or inducing undocumented individuals to come to, enter, or reside in \n20 \nthe state of Arizona whether or not individuals enter Arizona from another state or another \n21 \ncountry.  The federal statute, in contrast, does not criminalize actions with respect to \n22 \nentering Arizona from another state.  See GLAHR, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 1334 (noting \n23 \nGeorgia’s provision was not identical to federal law because the state law prohibited \n24 \n“knowingly inducing, enticing, or assisting illegal aliens to enter Georgia” whereas \n25 \n“[o]nce in the United States, it is not a federal crime to induce an illegal alien to enter \n26 \nGeorgia from another state”); Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1334 (same).  \n27 \nAdditionally, federal criminal harboring sanctions are not directed at unlawfully \n28 \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 56 of 65\n \n1 \npresent individuals themselves or at incidental or innocent contact, while A.R.S. § 13-2929 \n2 \npermits Arizona to target such persons and behavior for prosecution and imprisonment.36  \n3 \nCongress chose not to penalize unauthorized immigrants’ presence or movement within \n4 \nthe country or across state lines unless other factors are present, and the federal \n5 \nimmigration laws do not penalize transportation of these individuals in such situations.  \n6 \nSee Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1334 (noting that “the corresponding federal provision in \n7 \n8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) . . . does not extend to the smuggled or transported alien.”); \n8 \nSouth Carolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at *15 (finding that state law making it a crime for \n9 \n“an unlawfully present person to allow himself or herself to be ‘transported or moved’ \n10 \nwithin the state or to be harbored or sheltered to avoid apprehension or detection” was \n11 \npreempted in part because “[t]here is no comparable federal statute, and it appears that this \n12 \nprovision is unique in American law.”).  Thus, A.R.S. § 13-2929 is broader than its federal \n13 \ncounterpart because it criminalizes more activity than the federal statute intended, in clear \n14 \nconflict with federal objectives. \n15 \nWhile in one sense the Arizona statute is narrower than its federal counterpart \n16 \nbecause prosecution requires that the person must already be in violation of a separate \n17 \ncriminal offense, see U.S. v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d at 1002 n.18, that alone does not \n18 \ncure A.R.S. § 13-2929’s fundamental conflict preemption problem.  As this Court has \n19 \nrecognized, the relevant predicate offense can be something as mundane as a traffic \n20 \nviolation or a violation of the federal harboring and transporting statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1324, \n21 \nitself.

Supp. 2d at 1333 n.12 (finding \n25 \n                                                 \n26  36 Arizona could prosecute undocumented persons for “being harbored” by reading A.R.S. \n§ 13-2929 together with A.R.S. § 13-1003 (conspiracy), in much the same way that it \n27 \nalready prosecutes undocumented persons for “being smuggled” by reading A.R.S. § 13-\n28  2319 (smuggling) together with § 13-1003. \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 57 of 65\n \n1 \nGeorgia’s transporting and harboring law preempted in part because a violation of the \n2 \nfederal statute could be the predicate offense). \n3 \nArizona’s statute presents yet another conflict with federal law by failing to exempt \n4 \ncertain individuals from prosecution, making its reach wider than that of its federal \n5 \ncounterpart.  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(C) exempts from prosecution ministers or missionaries \n6 \nof religious denominations, while A.R.S. § 13-2929 provides no such exemption and \n7 \nwould allow prosecution of such individuals.  See A.R.S. § 13-2929(E) (exempting only \n8 \nchild protective services personnel and first responders acting in their official capacity).  \n9 \nThis inconsistency also supports a finding of conflict preemption.  See South Carolina, \n10 \n2011 WL 6973241, at *13 (“the inconsistent safe harbor provisions of state and federal \n11 \nlaw result in conflict preemption.”); Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1331 (finding harboring \n12 \nand transporting state statute preempted because it “actually prohibits conduct allowed \n13 \nunder federal law and criminalizes conduct that is lawful under federal law.”); Geier v. \n14 \nAm. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 529 U.S. 861, 899 (2000) (recognizing that “a federal statute \n15 \nimplicitly overrides state law . . . when state law is in actual conflict with federal law.”) \n16 \n(internal quotations and citations omitted).  \n17 \nLike Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina’s enjoined counterparts, A.R.S. § 13-\n18 \n2929 is preempted because, although it is “superficially similar to [the relevant federal \n19 \nstatute, 8 U.S.C.] § 1324, state prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation will \n20 \nundermine federal authority to ‘establish immigration enforcement priorities and \n21 \nstrategies’” and undermine federal purposes and objectives.  GLAHR, 793 F. Supp. 2d at \n22 \n1335 (quoting U.S. v. Arizona, 641 F.3d 339, 352 (9th Cir. 2011); Alabama, 813 F. Supp. \n23 \n2d at 1335-36; South Carolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at *21.  For all of these reasons, \n24 \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that A.R.S. § 13-2929 conflicts with federal \n25 \nlaw and is preempted.   \n26 \nII. Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm if the Preliminary Injunction Is Not \n27 \nGranted \n28 \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 58 of 65\n \n1 \nPlaintiffs and putative class members will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not \n2 \ngranted.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20 (injunction appropriate where irreparable harm “likely”).  \n3 \nThe alleged deprivation of their constitutional rights are alone sufficient to establish \n4 \nirreparable injury from § 2(B) and A.R.S. § 13-2929.  11A Charles A. Wright et al., \n5 \nFederal Practice & Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995) (“When an alleged deprivation of a \n6 \nconstitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable \n7 \ninjury is necessary.”); see also Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 472 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[I]t is \n8 \nthe alleged violation of a constitutional right that triggers a finding of irreparable harm.”) \n9 \n(granting preliminary injunction for plaintiff alleging Eighth Amendment claims against \n10 \nprison officials); Lavan v. City of Los Angeles, 797 F. Supp. 2d 1005, 1019 (C.D. Cal. \n11 \n2011) (“The Ninth Circuit has held that ‘an alleged constitutional infringement will often \n12 \nalone constitute irreparable harm.’”) (finding irreparable harm based on likelihood of \n13 \nestablishing violations of Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment due process \n14 \nrights) (citations omitted).  In addition, courts have repeatedly recognized that the \n15 \nenforcement of a preempted law may constitute irreparable harm, particularly where, as \n16 \nhere, more than monetary interests are at stake.  See, e.g., United States v. Arizona, 641 \n17 \nF.3d at 366; GLAHR, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 1340; South Carolina, 2011 WL 6973241, at \n18 \n*21; Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1336; see also Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 \n19 \nU.S. 374, 381 (1992). \n20 \nEven if this Court did not find that irreparable injury exists on the basis of the \n21 \nconstitutional violations raised here, ample evidence exists of the irreparable harm \n22 \nPlaintiffs will suffer from § 2(B) and A.R.S. § 13-2929.  Section 2(B) puts Plaintiffs and \n23 \nclass members at risk of unlawful detention and interrogation based on little more than an \n24 \nindividual officer’s “reasonable suspicion” that they are “unlawfully present in the United \n25 \nStates.”  A.R.S. § 11-1051(B).  Plaintiffs will be subject to racial profiling, additional \n26 \npolice scrutiny, prolonged detention, and possible arrest if § 2(B) is implemented.  See \n27 \nHarris Decl., United States v. Arizona, No. 10-1413,  ¶ 7 (Doc. 27-10); George Gascón \n28 \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 59 of 65\n \n1 \nDecl. ¶¶ 18–20 (Doc. 235-6); Eduardo González Decl. ¶¶ 16–17 (Doc. 235-8); Samuel \n2 \nGranato Decl. ¶ 16 (Doc. 236).  Indeed, the Court already found that Plaintiffs have \n3 \nalleged a “realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of . . . [the] operation or \n4 \nenforcement’ of [§ 2] because of their appearance and limited English-speaking ability.”  \n5 \nOrder, May 29, 2012, at 11 (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298 \n6 \n(1979)).  The Court further found that “[b]ecause § 2 applies during every lawful stop, \n7 \ndetention, or arrest, the Individual Plaintiffs will be subject to the allegedly \n8 \nunconstitutional immigration investigations even if they are stopped only for suspicion of \n9 \na minor traffic violation and even if they have not actually committed any crime.”  Id. at 8-\n10 \n9. \n11 \nIn addition, Plaintiffs, and many putative class members, will curtail their public \n12 \nactivities if § 2(B) is allowed to take effect out of fear that they will be subject to arrest \n13 \nand detention by law enforcement officials due to their appearance and limited English-\n14 \nspeaking ability.  See Vargas Decl. ¶ 7 (Doc. 236-10); C.M. Decl. ¶ 5 (Doc. 331-5); Tupac \n15 \nEnrique Decl. ¶ 3 (Doc. 236-9).  Members of plaintiff organizations will also reduce going \n16 \nout in public and attending organizational events out of fear that contact with law \n17 \nenforcement officials could lead to interrogation and detention under § 2(B).  Joseph \n18 \nHansen Am. Decl. ¶ 6 (Doc. 314-2); Eliseo Medina Decl. ¶ 6 (Doc. 236-9).  Plaintiffs will \n19 \nalso be fearful of having any contact with law enforcement, including reporting crimes or \n20 \nserving as witnesses.  See Ibarra Decl. ¶ 12 (Doc. 236-2) (“SB 1070 will cause many of \n21 \nour clients or prospective clients to not report that they are victims of crime out of fear that \n22 \ncontact with Arizona state law enforcement will subject them to detention, arrest and \n23 \npossible deportation.”); see also Medina Decl. ¶ 7 (Doc. 236-9); Gascón Decl. ¶¶ 9–10 \n24 \n(Doc. 235-6); Gonzalez Decl. ¶¶ 12–13 (Doc. 235-8), 18; Granato Decl. ¶¶ 9–10 (Doc. \n25 \n236). \n26 \nMoreover, Plaintiffs and putative class members are at risk of criminal prosecution \n27 \nunder A.R.S. § 13-2929.  The Court has already found that Plaintiff Luz Santiago “has \n28 \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 60 of 65\n \n1 \nalleged a ‘realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the . . . operation or \n2 \nenforcement’ of A.R.S. § 13-2929.”  Order, May 29, 2012, at 4.  As the pastor of her \n3 \nchurch, Plaintiff Santiago fears that she will face criminal sanctions because she frequently \n4 \nprovides transportation, food, and shelter to members of her congregation who may not be \n5 \nauthorized to remain in the United States.  Santiago Dep. at 20-21, 24-25 (Doc. 655-11).  \n6 \nFor example, Santiago has stated that she frequently drives members of her congregation \n7 \nto church retreats and to shop for groceries.  Id. at 20-21.  She also provides shelter to \n8 \nindividuals in need.  Id. at 24.  Under A.R.S. § 13-2929, it is likely that Santiago would be \n9 \nfound to do so “in reckless disregard” of the fact that some of those congregation members \n10 \nand individuals may be unlawfully present.  Order, May 29, 2012, at 16; see also Santiago \n11 \nDep. at 30-31, 33.  If A.R.S. § 13-2929 is not enjoined, Santiago will continue to face the \n12 \n“reasonable likelihood” of criminal charges.  See Order, May 29, 2012, at 16.  Because \n13 \nSantiago intends to continue to provide transportation and shelter to members of her \n14 \ncongregation without regard to their immigration status, see Santiago Dep. 58-59, she will \n15 \nsuffer irreparable harm if A.R.S. § 13-2929 is not enjoined.  See San Diego Gun Rights \n16 \nComm. v. Reno, 98 F.3d 1121, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 1996); see also GLAHR, 793 F. Supp. 2d \n17 \nat 1340 (finding that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm under similar harboring \n18 \nprovisions because they would be “subject to criminal penalties under laws that are \n19 \nallegedly preempted”); Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1332 (same). \n20 \n  Organizational Plaintiffs will also suffer direct harm in the form of resource \n21 \ndiversion, the frustration of their core mission activities, and the possibility of criminal \n22 \nprosecution of staff or volunteers under A.R.S. § 13-2929.  Organizational Plaintiffs have \n23 \nalready diverted significant resources toward educating their members about the effects of \n24 \nS.B. 1070, including A.R.S. § 13-2929.  Jennifer Allen Decl. ¶ 12 (Doc. 314-1); Alison J. \n25 \nHarrington Decl. ¶¶ 8, 23 (Doc. 314-4).  A.R.S. § 13-2929 will also hinder the \n26 \norganizational Plaintiffs’ ability to retain and recruit members because those members will \n27 \ncurtail their own travel and participation in organizational events in order to avoid being \n28 \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 61 of 65\n \n1 \ncharged with violating A.R.S. § 13-2929.  Allen Decl. ¶ 13-14.  This Court has already \n2 \nfound that “[t]he alleged harm to the organizational Plaintiffs will occur if S.B. 1070 \n3 \n[including A.R.S. § 13-2929] goes into effect, regardless of how it is enforced or applied.”  \n4 \nOrder, Oct. 8, 2010, at 9.   \n5 \nIn addition, Organizational Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if their staff or \n6 \nvolunteers are prosecuted under A.R.S. § 13-2929.  For example, staff from Plaintiff \n7 \nBorder Action Network (“BAN”) regularly bus members to events and organizational \n8 \nfunctions.  Allen Decl. ¶ 9.  Because BAN does not inquire into the citizenship or \n9 \nimmigration status of the members it transports and some of these members are persons \n10 \nwithout authorization to be in the United States, “BAN staff are concerned that this could \n11 \nsubject them to investigation under the new immigration law.”  Id.; see also Pl. Ariz. \n12 \nSouth Asians for Safe Families’ Answers to Intervenor Def. Governor Brewer’s First Set \n13 \nof Interrogs. at 6-7 (indicating that ASASF volunteers often transport citizen and non-\n14 \ncitizen domestic violence victim members to medical and legal appointments) (Ex. H).  \n15 \nSimilarly, organizational Plaintiff Southside Presbyterian Church will be irreparably \n16 \nharmed if its leaders, staff, parishioners, and volunteers are subjected to criminal \n17 \nprosecution under A.R.S. § 13-2929 for “performing work that is central to [their] faith” \n18 \nby providing assistance to the homeless or to immigrants in distress in the desert, or by \n19 \ntransporting parishioners and community members to activities and medical facilities.  \n20 \nHarrington Decl. ¶¶ 9-12, 21 (Doc. 314-4). \n21 \nIII.  The Balance of Equities Tips Sharply In Favor of Plaintiffs \n22 \nAny harm to the Defendants from the grant of a preliminary injunction is minimal \n23 \nbecause Plaintiffs ask only for the status quo to be maintained while the significant \n24 \nconstitutional challenges to § 2(B) are resolved.  As described above, without a \n25 \npreliminary injunction, the irreparable harms facing Plaintiffs are overwhelming, and \n26 \ncourts frequently have found that the equities favor an injunction to preserve the status quo \n27 \nin just such a situation.  See, e.g., Nat’l Ctr. for Immigrants’ Rights, Inc. v. INS, 743 F.2d \n28 \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 62 of 65\n \n1 \n1365, 1368 (9th Cir. 1984) (agreeing with district court’s conclusion that irreparable harm \n2 \nto plaintiffs outweighed harm to government from delay in implementing regulation); AFL \n3 \nv. Chertoff, 552 F. Supp. 2d 999, 1006-07 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (same).  Indeed the \n4 \npreservation of the status quo in the face of potential widespread and significant \n5 \nirreparable harm is precisely the purpose of a preliminary injunction.  See Sierra On-Line, \n6 \nInc. v. Phoenix Software, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir. 1984).  Plaintiffs merely seek \n7 \nto prevent Defendants from implementing a law that is constitutionally suspect in order to \n8 \nprevent broad irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and to the public.  Thus, the equities tip \n9 \nsharply in favor of the grant of a preliminary injunction.  \n10 \nIV. The Preliminary Injunction Will Serve the Public Interest \n11 \nThe interests of Plaintiffs and the public are aligned in favor of a preliminary \n12 \ninjunction.  The same violations that would irreparably harm Plaintiffs would concurrently \n13 \nharm the public interest.  In fact, § 2(B) is likely to result in widespread discrimination \n14 \nagainst racial and ethnic minorities, because law enforcement would be required to assess, \n15 \nwithout sufficient training and guidance, whether there is “reasonable suspicion” that an \n16 \nindividual is unlawfully present.   \n17 \nThe fact that law enforcement officials risk being sued by private parties, who \n18 \nbelieve that Arizona city and county officials have not enforced the law strictly enough, \n19 \nincreases the likelihood that racial profiling will be employed.  See A.R.S. § 11-1051(G); \n20 \nsee also Villaseñor Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5, 7 (Ex. D).  This provision sends a clear directive of \n21 \nmaximum enforcement to local law enforcement officials.  As a result, Plaintiffs and \n22 \nmembers of the public are at a substantial risk of being deprived of their constitutional \n23 \nrights to liberty and due process, with “no meaningful procedural safeguards against \n24 \nerroneous deprivations of liberty.”  Order, Oct. 8, 2010, at 23.  Given the near certainty of \n25 \nthese irreparable harms, it is unquestionably in the public interest to prevent these \n26 \nwidespread constitutional violations.  See Murillo v. Musegades, 809 F. Supp. 487, 498 \n27 \n(W.D. Tex. 1992) (the “public interest will be served by protection of Plaintiffs’ \n28 \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 715   Filed 07/17/12   Page 63 of 65\n \n1 \nconstitutional rights” in cases where the majority of the Hispanic population within a \n2 \ngeographic area would be subjected to “illegal stops, questioning, detentions, frisks, \n3 \narrests, searches, and further abuses” by local law enforcement). \n4 \nSection 2(B) will, as noted above, also deter individuals from interacting with law \n5 \nenforcement, thus compromising public safety.  González Decl. ¶¶ 12–13, 18 (Doc. 235-\n6 \n8); Granato Decl. ¶¶ 9–10 (Doc. 236); Gascón Decl. ¶¶ 9–10 (Doc. 235-6).  Section 2(B) \n7 \nwill undermine trust between the police and community members, for whom a routine \n8 \nencounter with law enforcement will become a lengthy detention.  This increased fear of \n9 \nlocal law enforcement in immigrant communities will threaten the safety of all Arizona \n10 \ncommunities, as well as the safety of police officers. \n11 \nMoreover, the public interest is served best when unconstitutional and preempted \n12 \nstate laws are blocked by courts.  See Arizona, 641 F.3d at 366 (“[I]t is clear that it would \n13 \nnot be equitable or in the public’s interest to allow the state . . . to violate the requirements \n14 \nof federal law . . . .  In such circumstances, the interest of preserving the Supremacy \n15 \nClause is paramount.” (internal quotation omitted)); see also South Carolina, 2011 WL \n16 \n6973241, at *21 (finding that a preliminary injunction of similar harboring provisions is in \n17 \nthe public interest); Alabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d at 1336 (same); Buquer, 797 F. Supp. 2d at \n18 \n925 (“‘the public has a strong interest in the vindication of an individual’s constitutional \n19 \nrights . . . .’” (quoting O’Brien v. Town of Caledonia, 748 F.2d 403, 408 (7th Cir. 1984))); \n20 \nGLAHR, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 1340 (same).  As described above, § 2(B) and A.R.S. § 13-\n21 \n2929 are preempted by federal law.  For the foregoing reasons, the public interest weighs \n22 \nin favor of a preliminary injunction. \n23 \n \n24 \nCONCLUSION \n25 \nThe Court should grant the requested injunction. \n26 \n \n27 \nDATED this 17th day of July 2012.

This action challenges Arizona Senate Bill 1070, as amended (“SB 1070”), a \n3  comprehensive set of state immigration laws expressly intended to “discourage and deter \n4  the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully \n5  present in the United States.”  SB 1070 proclaims and implements an immigration policy \n6  of “attrition through enforcement” for the State of Arizona.  The legislation creates an \n7  array of new state-law criminal offenses relating to immigration and imposes sweeping \n8  requirements on state and local law enforcement officers to investigate alleged \n9  immigration violations and to arrest and detain persons suspected of immigration \n10  violations.  The law was signed by Governor Janice Brewer on April 23, 2010, and is \n11  scheduled to go into effect on July 28, 2010.    \n12  2.  SB 1070 attempts to create a legal regime regulating and restricting \n13  immigration and punishing those whom Arizona deems to be in violation of immigration \n14  laws.  It is an impermissible encroachment into an area of exclusive federal authority and \n15  will interfere and conflict with the comprehensive federal immigration system enacted by \n16  Congress and implemented through a complex web of federal regulations and policies.  \n17  According to law enforcement officials in Arizona and elsewhere, SB 1070 will cause \n18  widespread racial profiling and will subject many persons of color—including countless \n19  U.S. citizens, and non-citizens who have federal permission to remain in the United \n20  States—to unlawful interrogations, searches, seizures and arrests.  \n21  3.  SB 1070 is unconstitutional.  It violates the Supremacy Clause and core civil \n22  rights and civil liberties secured by the United States Constitution, including the First \n23  Amendment right to freedom of speech and expressive activity, the Fourth Amendment \n24  right to freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, and the Equal Protection \n25  Clause guarantee of equal protection under the law. \n26 \n  -6-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 7 of 61\n \n1  4.  The plaintiffs in this action will suffer serious violations of their constitutional \n2  rights and civil liberties if SB 1070 goes into effect.  The named plaintiffs bring this \n3  action on behalf of themselves and a class of all others similarly situated to obtain \n4  preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and a declaration that SB 1070 violates the \n5  U.S. and Arizona Constitutions. \n6  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7  5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \n8  over Plaintiffs’ claims under the U.S. Constitution, as well as under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 \n9  and 1983.  The Court has authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \n10  and 2202. The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state-law claim under 28 U.S.C. § \n11  1367. \n12  6.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  All Defendants are \n13  sued in their official capacity and their official places of business are all located within \n14  this District.  All of the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred within this District.  \n15  PARTIES \n16  Organizational Plaintiffs \n17  7.  Plaintiff Friendly House is a non-profit organization whose mission is to foster \n18  excellence in the community by serving the educational and human service needs of its \n19  residents.  It provides comprehensive services to about 40,000 families, youth, and \n20  children each year and numerous direct services in several program areas, including \n21  immigration, family, youth, and adult services, workforce development, home care \n22  services, and charter school education.  Among other immigration services, Friendly \n23  House assists applicants for asylum and victims and witnesses of crime who are eligible \n24  for visas.  The clients served by Friendly House include citizens, non-citizens, and racial \n25  minorities, including Latinos.  SB 1070 will force Friendly House to divert scarce \n26  resources from critical programs in order to educate and assist individuals affected by SB \n  -7-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 8 of 61\n \n1  1070.  Friendly House’s mission and organizational goals will also be negatively impacted \n2  by SB 1070 because its staff will have a harder time encouraging clients to seek services \n3  in its various program areas to the extent that they involve interacting with government \n4  agencies and police.  Friendly House also fears that its current and prospective clients will \n5  be deterred from seeking immigration relief because local law enforcement will continue \n6  to stop and detain them, notwithstanding their application for relief, on the basis that they \n7  do not have any registration documents that are acceptable under SB 1070. \n8  8.  Plaintiff Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) is one of the largest \n9  labor organizations in the world, representing 2.2 million working men and women who \n10  work primarily in the public sector and in the janitorial, health services, long-term care, \n11  and security industries.  Many of SEIU’s members are recent immigrants to the United \n12  States and many of its members come from racial minority groups.  SEIU has long called \n13  for and worked toward comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration laws.  Another priority \n14  for SEIU is fighting discrimination against minorities, women and other groups in the \n15  workplace and in society in general.  In Arizona, SEIU has three affiliates: SEIU/Workers \n16  United Western Regional Joint Board; National Association of Government Employees; \n17  and Plaintiff Service Employees International Union, Local 5 (“SEIU Arizona”).  \n18  Together, these three affiliates have approximately 2,300 members spanning every county \n19  in the state, about 40 percent of whom are Latino and some of whom are other racial \n20  minorities.  SEIU works in partnership with SEIU Arizona and other groups to combat \n21  discrimination and mobilize for immigration reform at the national level.  SB 1070’s \n22  impact on already distressed county and municipal budgets will harm SEIU’s members to \n23  the extent that it will result in further pay cuts, furloughs, and layoffs.  Furthermore, some \n24  of SEIU’s Latino members or their families have already been subjected to stops by local \n25  law enforcement where they have been asked to produce proof of immigration status.  \n26  SEIU is concerned that its minority members will be even more likely to be stopped, \n  -8-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 9 of 61\n \n1  detained, arrested, and questioned by state and local police after SB 1070 goes into effect.  \n2  This will cause hardship for members of SEIU.  In addition, SEIU is concerned that \n3  members and potential members will be fearful to attend rallies, demonstrations, and \n4  union meetings or to engage in leafleting or other traditional labor activities because of the \n5  possibility of being stopped by the police under SB 1070.  This will significantly impact \n6  the ability of SEIU to protect its existing members and to organize new members.  SEIU \n7  joins this lawsuit to preserve its ability to organize new members and to protect the rights \n8  and interests of its members and prospective members.  \n9  9.  Plaintiff Service Employees International Union, Local 5 (“SEIU Arizona”), is \n10  a labor union and an affiliate of Plaintiff SEIU.  SEIU Arizona represents state, county, \n11  and municipal public service employees and has 1,800 members in Arizona, including \n12  members in every county throughout the state.  Approximately one-quarter of SEIU \n13  Arizona’s membership is Latino, and its membership also includes other racial minorities.  \n14  The primary mission of SEIU Arizona is to organize, represent, and empower employees \n15  in Arizona.  In addition, SEIU Arizona works in partnership with SEIU and other groups \n16  to combat discrimination and mobilize for immigration reform at the national level.  SB \n17  1070’s impact on already distressed county and municipal budgets will harm SEIU \n18  Arizona’s members to the extent that it will result in further pay cuts, furloughs, and \n19  layoffs.  Furthermore, some of SEIU Arizona’s Latino members or their families have \n20  already been subjected to stops by local law enforcement where they have been asked to \n21  produce proof of immigration status.  SEIU Arizona is concerned that its minority \n22  members will be even more likely to be stopped, detained, arrested, and questioned by \n23  state and local police after SB 1070 goes into effect.  This will cause hardship for \n24  members of SEIU Arizona.  In addition, SEIU Arizona is concerned that members and \n25  potential members will be fearful to attend rallies, demonstrations, and union meetings or \n26  to engage in leafleting or other traditional labor activities because of the possibility of \n  -9-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 10 of 61\n \n1  being stopped by the police under SB 1070.  This will significantly impact the ability of \n2  SEIU Arizona to protect its existing members and to organize new members.  SEIU \n3  Arizona joins this lawsuit to preserve its ability to organize new members and to protect \n4  the rights and interests of its members and prospective members. \n5  10.  Plaintiff United Food and Commercial Workers International Union \n6  (“UFCW”) represents more than 1.3 million workers, primarily in the retail, meatpacking, \n7  food processing, and poultry industries.  Within the State of Arizona there are more than \n8  21,000 UFCW-represented workers, whose employers include retail food and non-food \n9  retail, hospital services, meat packing and food processing, parking services, and legal aid \n10  services.   The UFCW represents workers who comprise a range of races and ethnicities, \n11  with varying degrees of English proficiency, including substantial numbers of Latinos.  \n12  The UFCW’s mission is to better the terms and conditions of employment for all workers \n13  it represents and thereby better the lives of their families and communities.  The UFCW \n14  accomplishes its mission through organizing, collective bargaining, and representation of \n15  employees.  These core activities require freedom of association and communication \n16  between the union and the employees and among the employees at the worksite and in the \n17  community, activities protected by the United States Constitution and federal labor law.  \n18  If SB 1070 is allowed to go into effect it will impose direct harm to UFCW’s core mission \n19  and representational obligations by subjecting UFCW members to unlawful questioning, \n20  arrest and detention by state and local law enforcement officers; deterring UFCW-\n21  represented workers from attending and participating in UFCW activities; and reducing \n22  UFCW’s ability to effectively advocate on behalf of the employees it represents. \n23  11.  Plaintiff Arizona South Asians For Safe Families (“ASAFSF”) is an \n24  organization based in Scottsdale, Arizona whose mission is to increase awareness of \n25  domestic violence and provide support services to victims of domestic violence in the \n26  South Asian community in Arizona.  Established in 2004, ASAFSF’s services include \n  -10-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 11 of 61\n \n1  providing family advocacy and safety-planning support to domestic violence victims \n2  through a toll-free helpline as well as direct services to victims in the form of financial \n3  assistance for child care, rent, lawyers’ fees, transportation, and emergent personal needs.  \n4  ASAFSF’s family advocates often transport victims to court and to medical and legal \n5  appointments.  ASAFSF also engages in community education, which includes hosting \n6  small group meetings with community members.  The majority of ASAFSF’s clients are \n7  immigrant women, many of whom are eligible for federal immigration relief through the \n8  Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), the Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \n9  (“TVPA”), or asylum procedures.  SB 1070 will interfere with the organization’s essential \n10  mission of providing support services to victims of domestic violence.  First, ASAFSF \n11  staff and volunteers will be at imminent risk of prosecution under SB 1070’s transporting \n12  provisions.  Second, ASAFSF will have to re-allocate its very limited resources to ensure \n13  that its clients feel safe reporting their experiences to law enforcement or while being \n14  transported by ASAFSF advocates.  Third, people will not come to its community \n15  meetings for fear of being stopped, interrogated, and arrested under SB 1070.  ASAFSF \n16  believes its clients will be afraid of approaching law enforcement to report crimes or \n17  interact with government officials because their appearance, limited English ability, and \n18  accents could be used by the police to question their authorization to be in the United \n19  States.  Plaintiff ASAFSF also fears that local law enforcement will stop and detain clients \n20  who have applied for immigration relief under the VAWA, the TVPA, or through the \n21  asylum procedures, because they do not have any registration documents that are \n22  acceptable under SB 1070, and that potential clients will be discouraged from seeking \n23  these services.  ASAFSF’s clients and potential clients will be placed at greater risk of \n24  physical and mental injury due to SB 1070. \n25  12.  Plaintiff Southside Presbyterian Church (“Southside”) is a religious institution \n26  based in Tucson, Arizona, whose mission is to serve God through worship and sacrament, \n  -11-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 12 of 61\n \n1  and by following the Bible's admonition to “do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with \n2  . . . God.” Southside’s members and leaders believe that the church has been called—in \n3  fact, commanded—by God to welcome and serve all people.  Southside follows the \n4  admonition in Hebrews 13:2:  “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for by this some \n5  have entertained angels unawares.” Southside serves the homeless, the day laborers, its \n6  low income neighbors, its own parishioners, and others without regard to race, gender, \n7  national origin, religion, or immigration status. Southside’s community is largely \n8  comprised of low-income Latino and Native Americans families, although it also includes \n9  Caucasians and African Americans.  Southside operates a homeless program, a Samaritan \n10  program through which parishioners provide assistance for individuals who are in distress \n11  in the desert, and an on-premises day laborer center.  The day laborers who participate in \n12  Southside’s program help run the center and solicit temporary employment by visibly \n13  gathering at a public sidewalk outside the church and signaling their availability for work \n14  to potential employers.  In addition, some of Southside’s religious leaders, staff, and \n15  volunteers frequently—and without knowledge of, or regard to, immigration status—\n16  transport parishioners and others to religious activities and to medical facilities; they \n17  would thus be at risk of being prosecuted pursuant to SB 1070’s transporting and \n18  harboring provisions.  SB 1070’s criminal prohibitions infringe on Southside’s ability to \n19  carry out its religious mission to serve all God's people.  Furthermore, Southside depends \n20  on its good relationships with police, social workers, and other city and state employees to \n21  safeguard church premises and its parishioners, but Southside staff and volunteers fear \n22  that these relationships will change after SB 1070 goes into effect.  Southside staff and \n23  volunteers will be hesitant to approach law enforcement and other authorities to report \n24  crimes or speak out as witnesses to crimes because the appearance, native language, and \n25  limited English ability of the community members served by Southside can be used by the \n26  police to question their authorization to be in the United States and to investigate \n  -12-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 13 of 61\n \n1  Southside staff and volunteers for potential violations of SB 1070.   SB 1070 will frustrate \n2  the mission of Southside and divert limited resources to educating and assisting \n3  community members who will be affected by SB 1070. \n4  13.  Plaintiff Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (“AZHCC”) is an \n5  association of Latino-owned businesses located throughout the state of Arizona that seek \n6  to support, promote, and foster business, cultural, and educational relationships between \n7  chamber members and the general public.  In addition to serving as a public advocate for \n8  its members, AZHCC offers seminars, workshops, marketing, and promotions, as well as \n9  networking and sponsorship opportunities for its corporate and community partners. \n10  AZHCC has more than 350 business members with employees, many of whom are \n11  Latinos, including U.S. citizens, non-citizens, monolingual Spanish speakers, limited \n12  English-proficient speakers and individuals who speak English with Mexican and other \n13  Spanish-language accents.  Because of their appearance, traditional cultural practices, and \n14  limited English proficiency, some members of AZHCC and/or their employees fear they \n15  will be subject to investigation or unwarranted arrest under Arizona SB 1070.  AZHCC \n16  members, like all small business owners in Arizona and nationwide, rely on local and state \n17  law enforcement to keep their companies safe and some AZHCC members would be \n18  deterred from approaching law enforcement to report criminal activity committed against \n19  them or others out of fear that the provisions of SB 1070 would subject AZHCC members \n20  to unwarranted questioning, detention or arrest.  AZHCC members also include non-profit \n21  organizations who serve immigrant populations, including noncitizens that do not have \n22  federal authorization to be in the United States.  The provisions of SB 1070 create new \n23  criminal penalties for certain immigrants and non-immigrants associating with immigrants \n24  and will cause considerable confusion for AZHCC’s members and other members of the \n25  general business community about their potential criminal liability under SB 1070.  \n26  AZHCC will suffer financial hardship because it will have to divert already limited \n  -13-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 14 of 61\n \n1  resources from the association's normal activities to educate and inform these groups \n2  resulting from the confusion surrounding SB 1070.  Finally, since many of AZHCC’s \n3  members heavily rely on a U.S.-born minority consumer base that will be reluctant to \n4  patronize businesses for fear that they could be harassed by local law enforcement, \n5  AZHCC will have to divert resources from other activities to inform and educate this \n6  group as well to counter the economic harm caused by SB 1070. \n7  14.  Plaintiff Asian Chamber of Commerce of Arizona (“ACC”) is an Arizona \n8  organization that brings together a network of Asian-owned businesses throughout the \n9  state that seek to support, promote and foster business, cultural and educational \n10  relationships between chamber members and the general public. ACC has over 90 \n11  organizational members.  ACC members and their employees, many of whom are also of \n12  Asian descent, include U.S. citizens and non-citizens, individuals born in the U.S. and \n13  recent immigrants, monolingual non-English speakers, limited English-proficient \n14  speakers, and individuals that speak English with an accent. ACC members also include \n15  non-profit organizations who serve immigrant populations, including non-citizens who do \n16  not have federal authorization to remain in the United States. ACC members often rely on \n17  law enforcement to keep their businesses safe and would be deterred from approaching \n18  law enforcement to report criminal activity committed against them or others out of fear \n19  that SB 1070 would subject ACC members to detention, questioning, or arrest.  The \n20  provisions of SB 1070 that create new criminal penalties for certain immigrants and \n21  persons associating with immigrants will cause considerable confusion for ACC’s \n22  members and other members of the general business community about their potential \n23  criminal liability under SB 1070.  ACC will have to divert its limited resources to \n24  addressing this confusion and fear. Finally, since many of its member organizations rely \n25  heavily on a minority consumer base that will become reluctant to patronize businesses \n26  for fear that they could be harassed by local law enforcement, ACC will have to divert \n  -14-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 15 of 61\n \n1  resources from other activities to address the considerable confusion and complaints \n2  surrounding SB 1070. \n3  15.  Plaintiff Border Action Network (“BAN”) is a statewide membership \n4  organization devoted to protecting the human rights and dignity of immigrant and border \n5  communities.  BAN builds the political and social capacity of its constituency through \n6  grassroots organizing, leadership development, policy advocacy, and educational \n7  activities.  BAN has over 1,000 members distributed across 6 Arizona counties.  The great \n8  majority of BAN’s membership is Latino.  In addition, BAN has some members who are \n9  day laborers who solicit work on public sidewalks and corners.  Some of BAN’s \n10  members, including its day laborer members, do not have permission to work or remain in \n11  the United States.  Other BAN members are legal residents or U.S. citizens, and some live \n12  in families of mixed immigration status and nationality.  BAN is concerned that its \n13  members will be stopped, detained, or arrested under SB 1070 due to their appearance or \n14  lack of acceptable documents.  BAN’s own mission will be frustrated by SB 1070.  Its \n15  staff frequently buses members to events and organizational functions without regard to \n16  their passengers’ immigration status, and they are concerned that this could subject them \n17  to prosecution under SB 1070.  In addition, BAN will have to divert significant resources \n18  to a public education campaign to inform its members about their rights and \n19  responsibilities under the new law and address their fears and concerns.  Finally, some of \n20  BAN’s members have already expressed a desire to leave the state; SB 1070 will make it \n21  harder for its staff to maintain its membership base and to recruit new members.   \n22  16.  Plaintiff Tonatierra Community Development Institute (“Tonatierra”) is a \n23  nonprofit community-based organization in Phoenix, Arizona that advocates for the \n24  cultural, educational, and economic development needs of the indigenous community in \n25  Arizona.  Some of the families it works with are members of indigenous American Indian \n26  tribes who fear that they will be stopped and questioned under SB 1070 if they are not \n  -15-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 16 of 61\n \n1  carrying tribal identification cards.  In addition, Tonatierra operates a day laborer center \n2  called Centro Macehualli.  The mission of Centro Macehualli is to empower workers and \n3  protect them from exploitation.  Day laborers who gather at Centro Macehualli are hired \n4  by homeowners, small businesses, and construction contractors as independent contractors \n5  or employees for temporary work such as gardening, cleaning, child care, moving, and \n6  construction.  Centro Macehualli does not condition membership and access to its services \n7  on immigration status.  As such, the Center is open to both citizen and non-citizen day \n8  laborers.  SB 1070 would frustrate Centro Macehualli’s mission by criminalizing the \n9  expressive activity of members who are not authorized by the federal government to work \n10  in the United States and chilling the expressive activity of members who are authorized to \n11  work.  Due to SB 1070, members of Centro Macehualli are refraining, out of fear of \n12  prosecution, from indicating their need and availability for work in public areas. \n13  17.  Plaintiff Muslim American Society (“MAS”) is a charitable, religious, social, \n14  cultural, and educational organization with an advocacy arm called the MAS Freedom \n15  Foundation (“MASF”).  Part of MAS’s mission is to protect the civil rights and liberties of \n16  American Muslims.  The mission of MASF is to integrate and empower the American \n17  Muslim community through civic education, participation, community outreach, and \n18  coalition building.  MAS and MASF have an office and chapter in Phoenix, Arizona, with \n19  over 30 members (“MAS-AZ”), who are also members of MAS.  Some of MAS-AZ’s \n20  members are immigrants who will be subjected to profiling based on their foreign \n21  appearance and clothing, such as headscarves.  SB 1070 will thwart the organizational \n22  mission of MAS, as MAS-AZ members have already indicated that they will be afraid to \n23  attend town hall meetings and its immigration clinic after SB 1070.  MAS’s mission to \n24  provide community education to the Muslim American community in Arizona will also be \n25  thwarted because its target audience will be too afraid to attend meetings and organized \n26  activities and events.  In addition, MAS-AZ will have to shift scarce organizational \n  -16-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 17 of 61\n \n1  resources to create new educational materials to protect its members from SB 1070, rather \n2  than spend these resources on other areas.   \n3  18.  Plaintiff Japanese American Citizens League (“JACL”) is a membership \n4  organization founded in 1929 that works to advance the civil rights of Japanese \n5  Americans and others who are victimized by injustice and bigotry.  JACL's Arizona \n6  chapter (\"JACL AZ\") has over 300 members, including non-citizen immigrants as well as \n7  U.S. citizens and racial minorities.  To advance its mission, JACL AZ sponsors public \n8  education events, holds membership meetings, conducts outreach to teachers and schools, \n9  and works to preserve the history of the Gila and Poston WWII Japanese American \n10  concentration camps.  JACL AZ collaborates with local city and community agencies to \n11  host a monthly senior center.  Some JACL AZ members who seek assistance through or \n12  participate in its programs lack authorization to remain in the United States; others have \n13  only an H1-B visa.  JACL believes that even its U.S. citizen members will be profiled \n14  under SB 1070.  JACL fears that SB 1070 will create fear and confusion, especially for its \n15  elderly who were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps.  In addition, JACL AZ will \n16  need to spend its scarce organizational resources and employ its mostly volunteer staff to \n17  create new educational materials to respond to SB 1070.  \n18  19.  Plaintiff Valle del Sol, Inc. is a non-profit organization that has served the \n19  Maricopa County community since 1970.  Valle del Sol helps thousands of individuals \n20  each year by providing extensive behavioral health and social services.  The agency \n21  provides counseling, substance abuse treatment, prevention services, case management, \n22  adult education, advocacy, leadership development, and services for seniors. Valle del \n23  Sol’s programs address the increasing social and community needs related to family, \n24  substance abuse, civic engagement, cultural diversity, and behavioral health problems.  As \n25  one of the largest Latino behavioral health and social service organizations in Maricopa \n26  County, Valle del Sol’s culturally diverse, bilingual staff provides a wide array of \n  -17-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 18 of 61\n \n1  programs and services for the entire family.  Its mission and the people it serves will be \n2  directly affected by SB 1070.   Valle del Sol serves a diverse mixture of populations a \n3  majority of whom are Latinos.  SB 1070 will force Valle del Sol to divert scarce resources \n4  from critical programs in order to educate and assist individuals affected by SB 1070.  \n5  Furthermore, SB 1070 will thwart the mission and organizational goals of Valle del Sol by \n6  deterring its clients from seeking the organization’s services because the clients fear \n7  interrogation, detention, and arrest under the provisions of SB 1070.   Because the \n8  agency’s name is in Spanish, there exists a fear by staff that on that basis alone, Valle del \n9  Sol may be a target under the provisions of SB 1070.  \n10  20.  Coalición de Derechos Humanos (“Derechos Humanos”) is a grassroots \n11  community-service organization based in Tucson, Arizona, whose mission is to promote \n12  human rights in the U.S.-Mexico border region.  Since 1992, Derechos Humanos has \n13  furthered its mission by organizing public education campaigns on issues related to \n14  immigration, conducting citizenship workshops for lawful permanent residents and \n15  immigrant refugees, and hosting intake clinics through which the organization assists \n16  community members—including racial minorities and non-citizen immigrants—who \n17  experience law enforcement, workplace, landlord/tenant, and housing discrimination \n18  problems.  Derechos Humanos offers its services without regard to whether the person is \n19  authorized by the federal government to be present in the United States.  Derechos \n20  Humanos has already been forced to suspend most of its work relating to community \n21  education on border deaths and leadership development to respond to inquiries from the \n22  community about SB 1070.  The fear and confusion created by SB 1070 has also resulted \n23  in a dramatic drop in attendance at workshops and events.  Community members served \n24  by Derechos Humanos are afraid to take steps to protect their rights when it means any \n25  interaction with government officials, including trying to protect their rights through the \n26  state courts.  SB 1070 will frustrate the mission of Derechos Humanos and divert limited \n  -18-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 19 of 61\n \n1  resources to educating and assisting community members who will be affected by SB \n2  1070. \n3  Individual Plaintiffs \n4  21.  Plaintiff Pedro Espinoza is a resident of Tucson, Arizona and a senior in high \n5  school.  Pedro was brought to the United States by his father, who had a work visa, when \n6  Pedro was only a few months old.  He has lived in Arizona ever since.  When Pedro was \n7  four years old, his father, who had been petitioning for Pedro to become a legal resident, \n8  passed away.  His grandmother then took over the immigration petition process, but she \n9  eventually passed away too before the application could be approved.  In November 2010, \n10  when Pedro was riding his bicycle home from his girlfriend’s house, he was pulled over \n11  by police officers for not having a bicycle light.  The officers started to ask questions \n12  about his identity and, when he could only produce a student ID, they arrested him and \n13  took him to jail.  At the jail, detention officers interrogated him about his immigration \n14  status.  He was held there for two days before being transferred to Immigration and \n15  Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and placed in deportation proceedings.  Pedro is a \n16  model student who hopes to go to college and study medicine one day.  He is active in his \n17  community, volunteers with the Salvation Army and attends church each Sunday.  Many \n18  community members helped raise money to pay for Pedro’s bond so that he could be \n19  released from detention while his deportation proceedings are underway.  He is now back \n20  home, but does not have any identification (other than his student ID) or registration \n21  document.  Because of SB 1070, Pedro fears that he could be stopped by state or local law \n22  enforcement officers and would be detained all over again because he does not have an \n23  identification or registration document that local law enforcement officials would \n24  recognize, even though the federal government is already aware of his presence in the \n25  United States and he is currently in deportation proceedings. \n26 \n  -19-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 20 of 61\n \n1  22.  Plaintiff C.M., a minor,1 is a resident of Gilbert, Arizona and a freshman in \n2  high school.  She is originally from Haiti and, due to the recent earthquake there, has been \n3  granted Temporary Protected Status in the United States.  C.M. is 15 years old but is often \n4  told that she looks 18.  C.M. does not carry any documents proving that she has \n5  permission to be in the United States.  However, she recently asked her mother to obtain \n6  an Arizona non-driver’s identification for her after she learned about SB 1070.  She was \n7  afraid that she would be stopped and questioned about her immigration status due to her \n8  dark skin and the fact that she speaks a foreign language.  She is nervous about speaking \n9  Haitian Creole with her friends and believes that it could get her in trouble with the police \n10  under SB 1070. \n11  23.  Plaintiff Luz Santiago is a pastor for a church in Mesa, Arizona.  She is a U.S. \n12  citizen, Latina, and fluent in Spanish.  Approximately 80 percent of her congregation \n13  lacks authorization by the federal government to remain in the United States.   In her role \n14  as a pastor, Ms. Santiago provides transportation and shelter to members of her \n15  congregation on a daily basis, including those members who are not authorized by the \n16  federal government to remain in the United States.  Ms. Santiago assists members of her \n17  congregation by driving them to court, doctor’s appointments, urgent care, the grocery \n18  store, and school.  Once a month, she also transports the youth in her congregation to \n19  spiritual outings.  Ms. Santiago also provides shelter to persons who seek sanctuary in her \n20  church and runs a food bank that does not screen for authorization by the federal \n21  government to remain in the United States.  Ms. Santiago fears for the well-being of \n22  vulnerable congregation members who could be stopped, detained, arrested, and \n23  questioned under SB 1070.  In addition, she believes that people will stop seeking help \n24  from the food bank because of SB 1070.  Ms. Santiago is concerned that she could be \n                                            \n25 \n1 C.M. is a minor and does not waive the protection of Rule 5.2(a) of the Federal \n26 \nRules of Civil Procedure.  Therefore, only her initials shall be listed in any filing made in \nconnection with this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a)(3). \n  -20-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 21 of 61\n \n1  subject to prosecution under the transporting and harboring provisions of SB 1070 for \n2  performing work that is central to her role as a religious leader. \n3  24.  Plaintiff Jim Shee is an elderly resident of Litchfield Park, Arizona.  He is a \n4  U.S. citizen of Spanish and Chinese descent, is fluent in Spanish, and has lived in Arizona \n5  his entire life.  Over the past month, Mr. Shee has been stopped twice by local police in \n6  Arizona and asked to produce identification documents.  On or about April 6, 2010, Mr. \n7  Shee was stopped and questioned on the way to his birthday party by a City of Phoenix \n8  police officer who demanded to see his “papers.”  He was not given a citation.  On or \n9  about April 16, 2010, Mr. Shee was stopped by a highway patrol officer with the Arizona \n10  Department of Public Safety in Yuma, Arizona.  The officer made a U-turn, activated his \n11  emergency lights, stopped Mr. Shee and asked to see his “papers.”  If SB 1070 goes into \n12  effect, Mr. Shee fears that he will be at even greater risk of being stopped and questioned \n13  by Arizona law enforcement officials based on his appearance.  He fears that he will be \n14  detained because he will be unable to prove to an officer that he is a U.S. citizen.  Mr. \n15  Shee does not wish to carry his passport with him at all times because he is afraid of \n16  losing it. \n17  25.  Plaintiff Jose Angel Vargas is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona and is a lawful \n18  permanent resident of the United States.  He speaks Spanish fluently but not English.  Mr. \n19  Vargas is a member of Tonatierra’s Centro Macehualli.  He has lawfully and peacefully \n20  solicited work at Centro Macehualli and on public street corners.  Mr. Vargas would like \n21  to continue soliciting work in public places; however, he is very worried that he will be \n22  detained by the police under SB 1070 due to his Latino appearance, the fact that he cannot \n23  communicate with a police officer in English, and because he solicits work alongside \n24  others who do not have authorization to work in the United States.  He was already \n25  arrested for trespassing once before in Arizona, in March 2009, while soliciting work on a \n26 \n  -21-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 22 of 61\n \n1  corner near 25th Street and Bell Road in North Phoenix.  While the charges were dropped \n2  shortly thereafter, Mr. Vargas continues to be fearful of encounters with the police. \n3  26.  Plaintiff Maura Castillo is a resident of Chandler, Arizona and a lawful \n4  permanent resident of the United States.  She speaks Spanish and can understand some \n5  English; however, she speaks very little English.  Ms. Castillo is originally from Mexico \n6  and appears Latina.  On August 10, 2010, Ms. Castillo was driving with a friend on \n7  Interstate 10 when she was stopped by an officer with the Arizona Department of Public \n8  Safety.  Upon approaching the vehicle, the officer asked Ms. Castillo for her driver’s \n9  license, registration and insurance.  He also asked Ms. Castillo for a “passport or visa.”  \n10  He did not inform Ms. Castillo why she had been stopped.  Because Ms. Castillo had \n11  recently had her Arizona driver’s license stolen, she presented a driver’s license from \n12  Mexico.  When she failed to provide the immigration documents and instead asked the \n13  officer if he was from “immigration,” the officer arrested Ms. Castillo by forcefully \n14  wrestling her out of her vehicle.  The officer pushed Ms. Castillo to the ground, injuring \n15  her shoulder.  Later, when Ms. Castillo was in handcuffs in the back of the patrol vehicle, \n16  the officer learned that Ms. Castillo’s license had been suspended in connection with a \n17  civil traffic proceeding (this was also the first time Ms. Castillo learned of the \n18  suspension).  Ms. Castillo was booked into the Maricopa County Jail for driving on a \n19  suspended license and resisting arrest.  At the Jail, however, after officials confirmed that \n20  she was lawfully in the country, the arresting officer told Ms. Castillo that he would not \n21  have arrested her if she had just cooperated and “shown him her documents.”  Shortly \n22  thereafter, Ms. Castillo’s case was scratched because no criminal complaint was ever \n23  filed.  Plaintiff Castillo experienced great trauma from this incident and fears that SB \n24  1070 puts her at greater risk of being stopped and questioned about her immigration status \n25  again due to her appearance and limited English ability. \n26 \n  -22-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 23 of 61\n \n1  27.  Plaintiff Maria Morales is a resident of Casa Grande, Arizona.  She is lawful \n2  permanent resident of the United States.  Ms. Morales lives in a neighborhood that is \n3  predominantly Mexican and speaks English with a heavy accent.  On November 15, 2010, \n4  while returning home to meet her son after school, she was pulled over by an officer with \n5  the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, apparently for rolling through a stop sign (Ms. Morales \n6  denies this and remembers having made a complete stop at the intersection).  However, \n7  when Ms. Morales asked the officer why she had been pulled over, he refused to tell her.  \n8  The officer simply demanded that she produce identification.  Ms. Morales reached into \n9  her wallet and pulled out an Arizona Identification Card so that it was visible to the officer \n10  and asked again why she had been stopped.  At that point, the officer removed Ms. \n11  Morales from her vehicle and placed her under arrest.  He confiscated her ID and cell \n12  phone, and searched her car.  Even though the officer was able to verify that her ID was \n13  valid, he had her vehicle towed and transported her to jail anyway.  Only after the tow \n14  truck had left did he allow Ms. Morales to call her husband to make alternative \n15  arrangements to pick up her son.  At the jail, a 287g certified officer confirmed that Ms. \n16  Morales was a legal resident.  He asked her why she didn’t tell the arresting officer she \n17  was resident and admonished her for not carrying her resident alien card.  Ms. Morales \n18  was not released until the next day.  Her criminal case was dismissed and she was never \n19  cited for any stop sign violation.  Ms. Morales should not have been arrested.  She fears \n20  that this kind of harassment and endless investigations into her legal status will occur \n21  under SB 1070 because of where she lives, her Hispanic appearance, and her limited \n22  English ability. \n23  28.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona.  He is Chinese and a \n24  lawful permanent resident of the United States.  He received his permanent resident status \n25  in 2008 after being granted asylum on the basis of political persecution by the government \n26  of the People’s Republic of China.  John Doe #1 has spent the last three years building a \n  -23-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 24 of 61\n \n1  new life here and currently works as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant.  John Doe #1 speaks \n2  Chinese and his English is very limited.   If SB 1070 goes into effect, he fears that he will \n3  be stopped by state or local law enforcement officers and questioned about his \n4  immigration status on the basis of his Asian appearance and accent.  John Doe #1 is afraid \n5  of interacting with government officials in his native language because it could prompt \n6  them to question him about his authorization to be in the United States.  John Doe #1 also \n7  understands that he will be detained if he is stopped without his green card.  Due to his \n8  experience as a victim of official persecution, this possibility is extremely distressing to \n9  John Doe #1. \n10  29.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3 is a resident of Tucson, Arizona.  She is of Mexican \n11  descent, and speaks Spanish and very limited English.  She has two children to whom she \n12  provides economic and housing support; a daughter who is 21 years old, and a son that is \n13  18 years old.  In 2009, Jane Doe #3 started spending time with a man who mentally \n14  abused her during their relationship.  When she tried to end the relationship, he slashed \n15  her tires, and later broke into her apartment several times and destroyed her furniture, her \n16  clothes, and defaced the apartment walls.  Due to his violent acts, she became afraid for \n17  her life and for her two children.  Jane Doe #3 has recently filed her application for a U-\n18  Visa based on her status as a violent crime victim, but she does not currently have a \n19  registration document that would satisfy the registration provisions of SB 1070.  Because \n20  she has filed her U-Visa application with the federal government, immigration authorities \n21  are aware of her presence in the country, but are not moving to initiate removal \n22  proceedings against her.  Although Jane Doe #3 does have a copy of her U-Visa filing \n23  receipt, she is fearful that state or local law enforcement would not understand the \n24  importance of the document.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3 fears that, were the enjoined \n25  provisions of SB 1070 to take effect, she would be stopped, detained, and arrested by a \n26 \n  -24-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 25 of 61\n \n1  state or local law enforcement officer due to her Latino appearance and the fact that she \n2  speaks limited English, and only with an accent. \n3  Defendants \n4  30.  Defendant Michael B. Whiting is the County Attorney of Apache County, \n5  Arizona.  According to Arizona law, the “county attorney is the public prosecutor of the \n6  county and shall . . . conduct, on behalf of the state, all prosecutions for public offenses.”  \n7  Arizona Revised Statutes (“A.R.S.”) § 11-532(A).

On April 19, 2010, the Arizona Legislature enacted SB 1070, a comprehensive \n7  system of state laws whose purpose is to “make attrition through enforcement the public \n8  policy of all state and local government agencies in Arizona” and to deter and punish “the \n9  unlawful entry and presence of aliens.”  SB 1070 creates several new state criminal \n10  immigration offenses as well as criminal procedures relating to the investigation, seizure, \n11  and detention of persons suspected of federal immigration violations.  The full text of SB \n12  1070 is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and incorporated by reference. \n13  61.  In enacting SB 1070, Arizona decided to express its dissatisfaction with federal \n14  immigration policy by legislating in an area reserved for the federal government. \n15  62.  On April 23, 2010, Governor Janice Brewer signed SB 1070 into law.  In her \n16  signing statement, the Governor said that SB 1070 “represents another tool for our state to \n17  use as we work to solve a crisis we did not create and the federal government has refused \n18  to fix.”   Statement by Governor Janice K. Brewer (Apr. 23, 2010), available at \n19  http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_042310_StatementByGovernorOnSB1070.pdf.  \n20  Governor Brewer also criticized “decades of federal inaction and misguided policy....”  Id. \n21  63.  On April 30, 2010, Governor Brewer signed into law House Bill 2162 (“HB \n22  2162”), which further amends sections of the A.R.S. created by SB 1070.  The full text of \n23  HB 2162 is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated by reference. \n24  64.  In her signing statement on HB 2162, the Governor again indicated that SB \n25  1070 is intended to empower the State of Arizona to take the place of the federal \n26  government in regulating immigration, stating that “[t]he federal government’s failure \n  -29-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 30 of 61\n \n1  requires us to act.”   Statement by Governor Janice K. Brewer (Apr. 30, 2010), available \n2  at http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_043010_StatementGovBrewer.pdf.   \n3  65.  The sponsors of SB 1070 intended for it to create a statewide regulation of \n4  immigration.  SB 1070’s author, State Senator Russell Pearce, has touted SB 1070 as a \n5  means to achieve the “self-deportation” of undocumented immigrants in the state.  \n6  Lawmaker Wants Special Session to Enact AZ Style Immigration Law, KLAS-TV-CBS \n7  NEWS, May 3, 2010, available at http://www.8newsnow.com/Global/story.asp? \n8  S=12419197.  Another sponsor of SB 1070, State Representative David Gowan, stated \n9  that SB 1070 was needed because “[t]he federal government has failed in helping this \n10  state seal its borders.”  Jeffrey Kaye, U.S. Congress and Arizona Deliver One-Two Punch \n11  to Immigrants, THE HUFFINGTON POST, Apr. 15, 2010, available at http://www. \n12  huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-kaye/us-congress-and-arizona-d_b_538369.html. \n13  66.  The enactment of SB 1070 was surrounded by a racially charged debate over \n14  the wisdom of adopting such a law.  In the weeks leading up to passage of the bill, \n15  protestors and advocates on both sides of the issue held rallies, issued statements, debated \n16  in national media, and bombarded the Governor’s office with e-mails and phone calls.  \n17  Alia Beard Rau and Ginger Rough, Ariz.

Arizona State Senator Richard Miranda asserted, “This bill . . . leads to a \n26  greater possibility of racial profiling.

The sponsor of SB 1070, Senator Russell Pearce, has sponsored legislation \n5  across a broad range of subjects that are related to issues of race and national origin in \n6  Arizona, including a recently-enacted bill intended to ban the Raza Studies program in the \n7  Tucson Unified School District.  Mary Jo Pitzl, Arizona Bill Targets Ban on Ethnic \n8  Studies, ARIZ. REPUBLIC, May 1, 2010, available at http://www.azcentral.com/news/ \n9  articles/2010/05/01/20100501arizona-bill-bans-ethnic-studies.html.  In 2006, Senator \n10  Pearce drew fire for racially insensitive remarks and distributing an article from a white \n11  separatist group and a link to that group’s website.  To his supporters, Mr. Pearce \n12  forwarded an email that accused the media of promoting “a world in which every voice \n13  proclaims the equality of the races [and] the wickedness of attempting to halt the flood of \n14  nonwhite aliens pouring across the borders.”  Ariz. Lawmaker In Hot Water Over Article, \n15  CHARLESTON GAZETTE & DAILY MAIL, Oct. 12, 2006. \n16  70.  Senator Pearce has called for reinstatement of a program of mass deportation \n17  of Mexicans and Mexican Americans, declaring:  “We know what we need to do.  In \n18  1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower put together a task force called ‘Operation Wetback.’  He \n19  removed, in less than a year, 1.3 million illegal aliens.  They must be deported.”  Sarah \n20  Lynch, Pearce calls on Operation Wetback for Illegals, EAST VALLEY TRIBUNE, Sept. 29, \n21  2006.  Mr. Pearce has admitted feeling uncomfortable with the way society is changing in \n22  Arizona, and attributed a rise in violent crime to Mexicans’ and Central Americans’ “way \n23  of doing business.”  He described the arrival of immigrants in Arizona as an attack by \n24  foreigners:  “I will not back off until we solve the problem of this illegal invasion. \n25  Invaders, that’s what they are. Invaders on the American sovereignty and it can’t be \n26  tolerated.” Ted Robbins, The Man Behind Arizona’s Toughest Immigrant Laws, \n  -31-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 32 of 61\n \n1  NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO, May 19, 2008, available at http://www.npr.org/templates/ \n2  story/story.php?storyId=88125098. \n3  71.  Following signing of the bill by Governor Brewer, the largest newspaper in \n4  Tucson lamented that SB 1070 was “a law that portrays the state as a place hostile to any \n5  kind of non-white person.”  Editorial, Law Creates Fear, Undermines Public Safety, Ariz. \n6  Daily Star, May 7, 2010, available at http://azstarnet.com/news/opinion/editorial/ \n7  article_59a4769c-cc60-5618-873a-9e083c643e99.html. \n8  72.  SB 1070 has caused racial tensions because it is widely understood that it is \n9  motivated by and will result in discrimination against Latinos and other racial minorities \n10  in Arizona on the basis of their race and national origin. \n11  Key Provisions of SB 1070 \n12  Requirement to investigate, determine, and punish status \n13  73.  SB 1070’s numerous provisions create a comprehensive state-law system of \n14  immigration regulation and enforcement that will: (1) require police to investigate and \n15  determine who may remain in the United States; (2) erect a state immigration registration \n16  and punishment scheme by creating state crimes and criminal penalties relating to alien \n17  registration, immigration status, and work authorization; and (3) require police to arrest \n18  and detain individuals and transfer them to federal authorities based merely on a belief \n19  that they have violated federal civil immigration laws, when state and local officers are \n20  not competent to make such a determination or authorized to make it under federal law.  \n21  74.  SB 1070 requires Arizona police, Arizona jails, and Arizona courts to detect, \n22  adjudge, punish, and facilitate the deportation of individuals who, in Arizona’s view, are \n23  not entitled to remain in the United States.  SB 1070 makes Arizona a legal island within \n24  the United States with separate immigration rules that do not apply in the other 49 states \n25  and that are contrary to and inconsistent with the federal Immigration and Nationality Act \n26 \n  -32-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 33 of 61\n \n1  (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq., and federal implementing regulations and policies, 8 \n2  C.F.R. §§ 100.1 et seq. \n3  75.  SB 1070’s attempt to create Arizona-specific laws and enforcement \n4  mechanisms relating to immigration is an impermissible attempt to regulate immigration. \n5  76.  SB 1070’s immigration regime also fundamentally conflicts with federal \n6  immigration law and legislates in fields occupied by such law. \n7  77.  SB 1070 as amended compels police officers to make immigration status \n8  determinations and to detain individuals based on a “reasonable suspicion” standard that is \n9  unworkable and cannot be applied by state and local officers; that requires impermissible \n10  reliance on race, national origin, and language; and that impermissibly burdens and \n11  interferes with the rights of lawful permanent resident immigrants and citizens in the State \n12  of Arizona.   \n13  78.  As amended by HB 2162, Section 2 of SB 1070 creates a new section of the \n14  A.R.S., § 11-1051, which requires a police officer who has conducted a “lawful stop, \n15  detention or arrest . . . in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city \n16  or town or [the State of Arizona]” to make a “reasonable attempt” to determine the \n17  immigration status of the person who has been stopped, detained or arrested, whenever \n18  “reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present.”  A.R.S. \n19  § 11-1051(B).  \n20  79.  The new statute, as amended by HB 2162, also requires that “[a]ny person who \n21  is arrested shall have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is \n22  released.”  A.R.S. § 11-1051(B).  This section requires the continued detention of an \n23  individual even if the sole reason for detention is status verification. \n24  80.  Section 2 of SB 1070 also authorizes officers to detain and transport a person \n25  who is determined by the officer to be an unauthorized immigrant to a federal facility, \n26  including a facility outside the officers’ jurisdiction, upon receiving verification from \n  -33-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 34 of 61\n \n1  federal authorities that the person is “unlawfully present.”  A.R.S. § 11-1051(D).  This \n2  section does not require an officer to have any other justification under state law to detain \n3  the individual. \n4  81.  Section 2 of SB 1070 imposes a standard that is unworkable and preempted by \n5  federal law.  The law requires state or local officers to attempt to determine immigration \n6  status, which must be determined through a federal administrative system applying \n7  complex federal statutes and regulations, and which is based upon historical facts about an \n8  individual that are not observable by an officer in the field. \n9  82.  Section 2 imposes an impermissible restriction and burden on speech by \n10  chilling the usage of words, accents, gestures, and other expressive speech.  \n11  83.  Specifically, Section 2 restricts, suppresses, burdens, and chills speech, \n12  expressive conduct, and the right to petition the government—including particularly the \n13  courts and law enforcement authorities—because the law exposes speakers to scrutiny, \n14  detention, and/or arrest based on the identity of the speakers and the content of their \n15  speech, including the speaker's appearance, associations, and the language or accent being \n16  used by the speaker, for purposes of determining whether the speaker is “unlawfully \n17  present” or has committed a “public offense that makes [him or her] removable.”  Both \n18  citizens and non-citizens may be chilled from communicating with the courts and law \n19  enforcement officials out of fear that they will be detained and/or arrested pursuant to SB \n20  1070. \n21  84.  For example, Plaintiff John Doe #1 is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona, and a \n22  legal permanent resident.  His English proficiency is extremely limited and he speaks \n23  English with a noticeable accent.  He fears that he will be targeted pursuant to SB 1070 \n24  based on the language in which he expresses himself. \n25  85.  Section 2 impermissibly vests in police officers unbridled discretion to base \n26  their “reasonable suspicion” that a “person is an alien and is unlawfully present” on the \n  -34-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 35 of 61\n \n1  content of the person’s expressive conduct.  Nothing in Section 2 forbids a police officer \n2  from developing a “reasonable suspicion” that a person “is an alien” and/or “is unlawfully \n3  present” based solely on that person’s gestures, language, accent, clothing, English-word \n4  selection, failure to communicate in English, and/or other expressive conduct—all of \n5  which is pure speech protected by the First Amendment.  Indeed, Section 2 invites a \n6  police officer to decide that a person is “an alien” because the person “acts” foreign or \n7  fails to “act” American—or to decide that a person is “unlawfully present” because the \n8  person “acts” like someone from a country the officer believes to be a source of \n9  “unlawfully present” immigrants. \n10  86.  SB 1070 functions as an impermissible prior restraint on speech because a \n11  speaker wishing to avoid being stopped, questioned, detained, arrested, jailed, and/or \n12  threatened with civil or criminal liability must be prepared to prove that he or she is not \n13  “unlawfully present” or cease engaging in protected speech and expressive conduct. \n14  87.  Section 2 permits warrantless seizures of individuals without probable cause \n15  that they have committed crimes. \n16  88.  Section 2 authorizes the warrantless search of an individual in any setting, \n17  including the individual’s home. \n18  89.  Section 2 furthermore permits local and state law enforcement officials to seize \n19  and detain individuals, pending determination of their immigration status, without \n20  providing for any process to ensure the constitutionality of the detention and seizure. \n21   \n22  Arrest, detention, and transfer provisions \n23  90.  Section 6 of SB 1070 amends Arizona’s state law on warrantless arrests, \n24  A.R.S. § 13-3883, to allow for the warrantless arrest of a person when an officer has \n25  probable cause to believe that the person has committed “any public offense that makes \n26  the person removable from the United States.”  A.R.S. § 13-3883(A)(5).  This provision \n  -35-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 36 of 61\n \n1  requires local law enforcement officers to do what they are not equipped or authorized to \n2  do:  make determinations about which “public offenses” make immigrants “removable” \n3  from the United States, determine an alleged offender’s immigration status, and make \n4  warrantless arrests solely for suspected violations of civil immigration laws, without \n5  regard to whether the federal government has authorized any such arrest or detention.   \n6  91.  Section 6 of SB 1070 permits warrantless arrests by a state or local officer \n7  based on a standard that is unworkable and preempted by federal law.  Whether an \n8  individual is “removable from the United States” is determined through a federal \n9  administrative system and application of complex federal statutes and regulations, and is \n10  based upon historical facts about an individual.  This determination cannot be made by a \n11  state or local law enforcement officer. \n12  92.  Section 6 provides no explanation or other sufficient guidance for individuals \n13  as to the meaning of “public offense that makes the person removable from the United \n14  States.”  This provision will cause warrantless seizures of individuals without probable \n15  cause that they have committed crimes.   \n16  93.   The broad sweep of Section 6 which allows for warrantless arrests of any \n17  person whom a law enforcement officer suspects of having committed a “public offense \n18  that makes the person removable from the United States” fails to provide minimal \n19  guidelines to govern law enforcement in who they can and cannot arrest. \n20  94.  Section 6 authorizes the warrantless arrest of an individual in any setting, \n21  including the individual’s home.      \n22  95.  Section 6 furthermore permits local and state law enforcement officials to \n23  detain and transport individuals to federal facilities in the state, without providing for any \n24  process to ensure the constitutionality of the detention. \n25  New state criminal provisions relating to immigration status and to work authorization  \n26 \n  -36-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 37 of 61\n \n1  96.  Section 3 of SB 1070, as amended by HB 2162, enacts a state immigration \n2  registration and penalty scheme in an area that Congress has exclusively regulated.  SB \n3  1070 conflicts with federal law and enforcement priorities, burdens the enforcement of \n4  federal law and is an obstacle to federal immigration enforcement and prosecution \n5  policies.  Specifically, SB 1070 creates a new state criminal offense of “willful failure to \n6  complete or carry an alien registration document.”  A.R.S. § 13-1509.  The primary \n7  element of the offense is that the person “is in violation of 8 United States Code section \n8  1304(e) or 1306(a),” federal statutes that impose certain requirements that non-citizens \n9  register with the federal government and carry registration documents.  Under SB 1070, \n10  the first offense is deemed a Class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $100 and \n11  up to 20 days of jail time.  A.R.S. § 13-1509(H).  Subsequent offenses are punishable by \n12  up to 30 days of jail time.  Id. \n13  97.  The purpose of the state registration provision is to punish immigrants with \n14  incarceration or to compel the initiation of federal immigration removal proceedings \n15  without regard to federal determinations and policies.  State Senator Russell Pearce, chief \n16  sponsor of SB 1070, has stated that this provision of SB 1070 is intended to give law \n17  enforcement officers an additional means by which to “hold an illegal alien under state \n18  law if need be or just call ICE and turn them over to ICE.”  See Message From Sen. \n19  Russell Pearce (Mar. 24, 2010), available at http://www.maricopagop.org/2010/03/ \n20  24/legislative-alert-hb-2632-and-sb1070/#more-1962. \n21  98.  Section 5 of SB 1070 defines new state crimes based on the solicitation and \n22  performance of work by individuals who lack federal work authorization.  A.R.S. § 13-\n23  2928.  This section makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor for anyone who attempts to hire or \n24  pick up day laborers to work at a different location, if the driver is impeding the normal \n25  flow of traffic.  A.R.S. § 13-2928(A).  This section also makes it a misdemeanor offense \n26  for a worker to get into a car if it is impeding traffic.  A.R.S. § 13-2928(B).  The statute \n  -37-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 38 of 61\n \n1  also makes it a state crime for a person who “is unlawfully present in the United States \n2  and who is an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public \n3  place or perform work as an employee or independent contractor in this state.”  A.R.S. § \n4  13-2928(C). \n5  99.  Section 5 of SB 1070 creates a content-based regulation of protected speech. \n6  100. Section 5 prohibits and regulates speech soliciting “work in a public place” \n7  (emphasis added) through verbal or nonverbal communication by a gesture or nod, \n8  making it a crime for certain individuals to do so, while speech of a different content, even \n9  if expressed in the same time, place, and manner, is not so proscribed.   \n10  101. Section 5 prohibits the expression of availability to work in any “public place,” \n11  including traditional public fora such as public streets, sidewalks, and parks.  \n12  102. Section 5 fails to define what constitutes “work,” covering such innocuous \n13  activity as artists offering to paint portraits in a public park and students conducting a car-\n14  wash.  Section 5 contains an impermissibly vague definition of “solicit” as it includes all \n15  verbal communication without qualification and brings within its reach “nonverbal \n16  communication by a gesture or nod.”  Section 5 also requires that the “communication . . . \n17  indicate to a reasonable person that a person is willing to be employed,” which is so vague \n18  as to be unenforceable, and could criminalize conduct, such as waving to a friend, which \n19  is not, in fact, soliciting work. \n20  103. Arizona does not have a compelling or significant governmental interest in \n21  regulating speech and expression in the content-based manner employed by SB 1070.  Nor \n22  is SB 1070 the least restrictive means to further any such interest. \n23  104. Section 5 also makes it unlawful for a person who is “unlawfully present” in \n24  the United States and who is unauthorized to work to solicit work in a public place or to \n25  knowingly apply for work regardless of whether any employment or business relationship \n26  is entered into. \n  -38-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 39 of 61\n \n1  105. Since the work of day laborers is by definition temporary and informal, day \n2  laborers and the contractors who hire them do not find each other through conventional \n3  advertising of availability.  Rather, day laborers signal their availability for work by \n4  visibly gathering in public areas such as sidewalks or parking lots and gesturing to \n5  potential employers.   \n6  106. Many persons, including members of Tonatierra’s Centro Macehualli, persons \n7  who participate in Southside’s day laborer program, members of Border Action Network, \n8  and Plaintiff Jose Vargas have previously expressed their desire, need, and availability for \n9  employment to persons in vehicles on the street, while peacefully standing on a public \n10  way, and have obtained lawful employment performing services such as gardening, \n11  moving, and light construction.  These individuals and other day laborers wish to continue \n12  to engage in such expressive activity on sidewalks and other public areas in Arizona to \n13  indicate their need and availability to work.  Indeed, for many, day labor is a critical, and \n14  oftentimes the only available means to obtain work.  However, individuals fear doing so \n15  in the same manner as they have in the past because A.R.S. §§ 13-2928(C) and (D) \n16  subject them to the danger of arrest, fines, and other penalties should they engage in such \n17  expression. \n18  107. Section 5 of SB 1070 also creates several new state criminal laws prohibiting \n19  the transporting, moving, concealing or harboring of unauthorized immigrants.  A.R.S. §§ \n20  13-2929(A)(1) and (2).  This section also makes it a crime to “encourage or induce an \n21  alien to come to or reside in [Arizona]” with knowledge or reckless disregard of the fact \n22  that “such coming to, entering or residing in this state is or will be in violation of law.”  \n23  A.R.S. § 13-2929(A)(3).  A person who violates these provisions would be subject to a \n24  class 1 misdemeanor and a fine of at least $1,000 with additional penalties where the \n25  offense involves ten or more immigrants.  A.R.S. § 13-2929(D). \n26 \n  -39-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 40 of 61\n \n1  108. In addition, under section 10 of SB 1070, any means of transportation will be \n2  impounded if it is deemed to have been used in connection with violations of the \n3  harboring statute.  A.R.S. § 13-2929(B). \n4  109. The transportation, harboring, and encouragement provisions of SB 1070 \n5  provide no explanation or other sufficient guidance for individuals as to what actions will \n6  be deemed “in furtherance of illegal presence” or “that the immigrant has entered or \n7  remained in the United States illegally.” \n8  Coercion of state and local police \n9  110. Section 2 of SB 1070, as amended, creates a private right of action for any \n10  person to sue a city, town, or county “that adopts or implements a policy that limits or \n11  restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted \n12  by federal law.”  This provision requires state and local law enforcement agencies to \n13  prioritize immigration over many competing law enforcement activities and thus strips \n14  agencies of their discretion to exercise considered judgment about how best to ensure \n15  public safety. \n16  Comprehensive Federal Immigration System \n17  111. The federal government has exclusive power over immigration matters.  The \n18  U.S. Constitution grants the federal government the power to “establish a uniform Rule of \n19  Naturalization,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 4, and to “regulate Commerce with foreign \n20  Nations,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  In addition, the Supreme Court has held that the \n21  Federal government’s power to control immigration is inherent in the nation’s \n22  sovereignty. \n23  112. The U.S. Congress has created a comprehensive system of federal laws \n24  regulating and enforcing immigration in the INA.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.  This \n25  extensive statutory scheme leaves no room for supplemental state laws. \n26 \n  -40-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 41 of 61\n \n1  113. The federal government has also issued numerous regulations, policies, and \n2  procedures interpreting the provisions of the INA and has established a large and complex \n3  administrative apparatus to carry out its mandates. \n4  114. The INA carefully calibrates the nature (criminal or civil) and degree of \n5  penalties applicable to each possible violation of its terms. \n6  115. The INA contains complex and exclusive procedures for determining \n7  immigration and citizenship status, deciding whether the civil provisions of the \n8  immigration laws have been violated, and determining whether an individual may \n9  lawfully be removed from the United States.   \n10  116. Under federal law, there is no single, readily ascertained category or \n11  characteristic that establishes whether a particular person may or may not remain in the \n12  United States.  The answer to that question is a legal conclusion that can only be reached \n13  through the processes set forth in the INA and may depend on the discretionary \n14  determinations of federal officials. \n15  117. There are many non-citizens who are present in the United States without \n16  formal permission who lack the “registration document” mandated by SB 1070, yet would \n17  not be removed if placed in federal removal proceedings.  For example, an individual may \n18  be eligible for some form of immigration relief, such as asylum, adjustment of status, or \n19  withholding of removal.  Some of these individuals are known to the federal government; \n20  others will not be identified until they are actually placed in proceedings by the federal \n21  government and their cases are adjudicated. \n22  118. Federal immigration agencies such as ICE or U.S. Customs and Border \n23  Protection do not and cannot determine whether a particular person may remain in the \n24  United States, or whether a particular person has committed a “public offense” that would \n25  make the person “removable,” without going through the procedures set forth in the INA.  \n26  Federal agencies similarly do not and cannot determine definitively, in response to a \n  -41-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 42 of 61\n \n1  demand from a state or local official, whether an individual is “unlawfully present” or has \n2  “authorization to remain in the United States” as those phrases are used in SB 1070.  The \n3  databases searched in response to these queries are not set up to make final determinations \n4  of whether an individual has federally authorized immigration status.  These agencies can \n5  only determine whether they believe a non-citizen may be charged with deportability.  \n6  Such a prosecutorial decision is not a determination of the individual’s “immigration \n7  status,” which entails a complex administrative process.  The phrase “immigration status” \n8  is usually used to refer to a number of categories defined by the INA for classifying \n9  individuals, not the ultimate question of whether an individual may remain in the United \n10  States.   \n11  119.  Furthermore, determining whether or not a person is a citizen of the United \n12  States can be a complex and counterintuitive process.  U.S. citizens are not required to \n13  carry documentary proof of their citizenship.  There is no national database that contains \n14  information on every U.S. citizen.  Some people are actually unaware of their U.S. \n15  citizenship because they may have acquired U.S. citizenship at birth by operation of law \n16  due to their parents’ citizenship, despite not being born in the United States.  See, e.g., \n17  INA § 322, 8 U.S.C. § 1433.  Others automatically obtained citizenship when their parents \n18  became naturalized U.S. citizens.  See, e.g., INA § 320, 8 U.S.C. § 1431. \n19  120. SB 1070’s creation of a state immigration system fundamentally conflicts with \n20  the INA’s statutory scheme, impermissibly encroaches on the federal government’s \n21  exclusive power to regulate immigration, and will lead to erroneous determinations by \n22  state and local officials. \n23  121. Moreover, SB 1070 conflicts with and is preempted by provisions of the INA \n24  that set forth comprehensive federal schemes addressing: (1) alien registration; (2) \n25  transportation and harboring; (3) work authorization and sanctions for unauthorized work; \n26  and (4) arrest authority for immigration violations. \n  -42-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 43 of 61\n \n1  Federal registration system \n2  122. The INA includes a national alien registration system that displaces and \n3  preempts state alien registration laws. \n4  123. The federal alien registration scheme requires certain non-citizens to register \n5  with the federal government and to carry proof of this registration with them.  8 U.S.C. §§ \n6  1302, 1306(a), and 1304(d)-(e).  Specifically, the INA requires every non-citizen in the \n7  United States over the age of 14 who has been in the United States for over 30 days to \n8  apply for registration with the federal government.  8 U.S.C. § 1302(a).  Once registered, \n9  non-citizens are given a “certificate of alien registration or an alien registration receipt \n10  card,” the form and issuance of which are to be prescribed in “regulations issued by the \n11  Attorney General.”  8 U.S.C. § 1304(d).  Non-citizens over the age of 18 who willfully \n12  fail to carry these documents face fines or prison time of up to 30 days.  8 U.S.C. § \n13  1304(e).  Non-citizens who willfully fail to register face fines or prison time of up to six \n14  months.  8 U.S.C. § 1304(a). \n15  124. The federal registration scheme has been in place since 1940 and was designed \n16  to create a single, uniform, national scheme. \n17  125. The preemptive effect of the federal alien registration scheme was expressly \n18  recognized by the President of the United States when the scheme was created and has \n19  been expressly upheld by the Supreme Court. \n20  126. The federal regulation implementing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1302, 1304, and 1306 \n21  prescribes as “evidence of registration” specific forms for compliance.  See 8 C.F.R. § \n22  264.1.  The list, however, has not been kept up to date with current federal forms and \n23  procedures.  As a result, there are categories of noncitizens who have applied for \n24  immigration benefits or whose presence in the United States is otherwise known to federal \n25  immigration agencies but who do not have registration documents that are valid under the \n26  regulation.   \n  -43-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 44 of 61\n \n1  127. Many of the changes that have been made to the INA since the enactment of \n2  the registration provisions reflect Congress’s decision to focus on and prioritize \n3  immigration enforcement against those immigrants who commit serious criminal offenses.  \n4  Targeting immigrants convicted of serious crimes, rather than those who may be in \n5  violation of the registration provisions, is the principal priority of federal immigration \n6  officers.   \n7  Federal transportation provision \n8  128. The INA also establishes criminal penalties for the transporting and harboring \n9  of certain non-citizens.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(a)(1)-(2).  Violations of these provisions \n10  carry fines and prison terms ranging from five years to life.  Id.  \n11  129. The federal courts are engaged in an ongoing process of interpreting the \n12  statutory language in 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) and determining the reach of the federal \n13  prohibitions therein.  Arizona law enforcement officers are neither trained nor equipped to \n14  have a detailed and current understanding of these interpretations. \n15  130. Arizona courts are not required to interpret the language in SB 1070 regarding \n16  transportation and harboring consistently with the federal courts’ interpretation of similar \n17  language in federal law. \n18  131. SB 1070’s transportation and harboring provisions require Arizona’s courts, as \n19  a prerequisite to finding a violation, to determine whether an alien “has come to, entered, \n20  or remains in the United States in violation of the law” or whether an alien’s entry “will \n21  be in violation of law” as those terms are used in 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a). \n22  // \n23  Federal employment authorization and sanctions system \n24  132. The INA contains a comprehensive scheme to regulate the employment of \n25  aliens that reflects a careful balance between multiple objectives, including the desire to \n26  reduce unauthorized employment, to protect workers against discrimination, and to \n  -44-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 45 of 61\n \n1  impose manageable standards on employers and workers.  The comprehensiveness of that \n2  federal scheme has been recognized by the Supreme Court. \n3  133. Congress chose to regulate alien employment in the INA by focusing on \n4  employers.  Employers are required to verify the employment authorization of applicants \n5  on Form I-9, and employers who knowingly employ unauthorized workers are subject to \n6  civil penalties or criminal penalties if the violation is sufficiently severe.  Federal law does \n7  not impose fines or criminal penalties on unauthorized workers simply for working \n8  without authorization. \n9  134. Arizona’s decision to criminalize unauthorized employment despite \n10  Congress’s choice of other means to address such conduct directly conflicts with federal \n11  law.  \n12  Federal restrictions on arrest authority \n13  135. State and local police have no general authority to enforce federal immigration \n14  law.  Federal law specifically authorizes state officers to assist in immigration \n15  enforcement only in narrowly defined circumstances and otherwise reserves immigration \n16  enforcement authority to the federal government. \n17  136. Section 1357(g) of Title 8 of the U.S. Code allows the federal government to \n18  “enter into a written agreement with a State, or any political subdivision” to carry out \n19  “function[s] of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or \n20  detention of aliens in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g).  These agreements are \n21  commonly referred to as “287(g) agreements” after the section of the INA in which they \n22  are codified.  However, such agreements may be entered into only if the federal \n23  government determines the state officers are “qualified to perform a function of an \n24  immigration officer,” id., and the federal government must train and supervise officers \n25  who are authorized under such an agreement.  Nine agencies in Arizona have current \n26  agreements pursuant to this statutory provision. \n  -45-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 46 of 61\n \n1  137. SB 1070 explicitly grants state and local law enforcement officers authority to \n2  make immigration determinations, arrests, and investigations without and outside of the \n3  authority provided by a 287(g) agreement, even with respect to those agencies in Arizona \n4  that have a 287(g) agreement. \n5  138. The other provisions in federal law authorizing state or local immigration \n6  enforcement are also carefully constrained.  State and local police are authorized to make \n7  arrests for certain immigration crimes—smuggling, transporting, or harboring criminal \n8  aliens, and illegal entry by a previously deported felon.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(10), 1252c.  \n9  Another provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(10), allows the Attorney General to authorize “any \n10  State or local law enforcement officer” to enforce immigration laws upon certification of \n11  “an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens,” but no such certification has occurred. \n12  139. Congress’s intent that state and local officers are generally prohibited from \n13  enforcing immigration laws is clear both from the statutory scheme and from the \n14  statements of its members.   \n15  140. Even as to federal immigration officers, the INA and associated regulations \n16  contain significant restrictions on the circumstances in which warrantless arrests may be \n17  made and the procedures that are required following such arrests.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1357(a), \n18  (d); 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.1-287.3, 287.5, 287.8, 287.10.  \n19  SB 1070 Interferes with Federal Interests \n20  141. Federal officials at the very highest levels oppose SB 1070 as interfering with \n21  federal governmental interests.   \n22  142. Janet Napolitano, the immediate past governor of Arizona and current U.S. \n23  Secretary of Homeland Security, said, “The Arizona immigration law will likely hinder \n24  federal law enforcement from carrying out its priorities of detaining and removing \n25  dangerous criminal aliens.”  Divisive Ariz.

SB 1070 also has created serious foreign relations issues for the U.S. \n4  government.  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noted that the government of Mexico \n5  issued a travel advisory for its citizens traveling in Arizona and that SB 1070 had the \n6  potential to upset U.S.-Mexico diplomatic efforts on drug enforcement in the border \n7  region.

Attorney General Eric Holder further criticized SB 1070, saying, “I think we \n11  could potentially get on a slippery slope where people will be picked on because of how \n12  they look as opposed to what they have done, and that is, I think, something that we have \n13  to try to avoid at all costs.”  Holder: Feds May Sue Over Arizona Immigration Law, CNN, \n14  May 9, 2010, available at http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/05/09/holder.arizona. \n15  immigration/index.html.  Attorney General Holder also stated that implementation of SB \n16  1070 will lead to “a situation where people are racially profiled, and that could lead to a \n17  wedge drawn between certain communities and law enforcement, which leads to the \n18  problem of people in those communities not willing to interact with people in law \n19  enforcement, not willing to share information, not willing to be witnesses where law \n20  enforcement needs them.”  Id.  \n21  148. Many prominent law enforcement and elected officials in Arizona have \n22  condemned SB 1070 on the grounds that it will lead to rampant racial profiling, divert \n23  resources from law enforcement work, keep immigrants and other people of color from \n24  reporting crimes to police, and ultimately diminish community safety. \n25  149. Former Governor Napolitano said, “With the strong support of state and local \n26  law enforcement, I vetoed several similar pieces of legislation as governor of Arizona \n  -48-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 49 of 61\n \n1  because they would have diverted critical law enforcement resources from the most \n2  serious threats to public safety and undermined the vital trust between local jurisdictions \n3  and the communities they serve.” Divisive Ariz.

The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police opposed SB 1070, stating that SB \n7  1070 “will negatively affect the ability of law enforcement agencies across the state to \n8  fulfill their many responsibilities in a timely manner.”  See Press Release, Arizona \n9  Association of Chiefs of Police, AACOP Statement on Senate Bill 1070, available at \n10  http://www.leei.us/main/media/AACOP_STATEMENT_ON_SENATE_bILL_1070.pdf. \n11  151. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik has warned that the law will lead to \n12  racial profiling.  He stated, “[i]f I tell my people to go out and look for A, B, and C, \n13  they're going to do it.  They’ll find some flimsy excuse like a tail light that’s not \n14  working as a basis for a stop, which is a bunch of baloney.”  See The Dupnik Rebellion: \n15  Pima’s Top Cop Says ‘No’ to SB 1070, KGUN-ABC NEWS, Apr. 27, 2010, available at \n16  http://www.kgun9.com/Global/story.asp?S=12386648.   \n17  152. Chief John Harris of the Sahuarita Police Department, who is the current \n18  president of the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police, cautioned that “victims may not \n19  report crimes to his officers” as a result of SB 1070.

Phil Gordon, the Mayor of Phoenix, stated that SB 1070 “unconstitutionally \n25  co-opts our police force to enforce immigration laws that are the rightful jurisdiction of \n26  the federal government.”  Phil Gordon, Not in My State: Anti-Immigration Law Doesn’t \n  -49-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 50 of 61\n \n1  Reflect the Beliefs of Arizona’s People, WASH.

The policies and practices of the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office (“MCSO”) \n5  demonstrate that SB 1070 cannot be enforced without improperly singling out racial and \n6  ethnic minorities, including many U.S. citizens and persons authorized by the federal \n7  government to be present in the U.S., for stops, interrogations, arrests, and detentions.  \n8  155. Maricopa County Sheriff Arpaio has publicly stated that his own agency has \n9  been doing what he believes SB 1070 mandates.  MSNBC NEWS, April 26, 2010, \n10  available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHfOBUDzoPo.  Three years ago, Sheriff \n11  Arpaio announced that MCSO was becoming “a full fledged anti-illegal immigration \n12  agency.”  Judi Villa and Yvonne Wingett, Sheriff Unveils Migrant Hotline, ARIZ. \n13  REPUBLIC, Jul. 21, 2007, available at http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/ \n14  local/articles/0721hotline0721.html.    \n15  156. According to MCSO training materials, the fact that an individual has no \n16  English skills or speaks English poorly is a factor indicating that an individual is not \n17  “lawfully present” in the United States.

As part of its focus on immigration enforcement, MCSO has systematically \n25  used pretextual stops to investigate immigration, targeting Latinos.  Since 2007, the \n26  agency has instituted a policy of identifying day laborers and persons appearing to be \n  -50-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 51 of 61\n \n1  Latino whom deputies should investigate for potential immigration violations, and then \n2  developing probable cause for a traffic violation to stop them.  \n3  158. A comprehensive investigation by the Arizona Republic found that during \n4  eight MCSO so-called “crime suppression operations” studied, MCSO deputies engaged \n5  in selective enforcement of the traffic law, and that the majority of drivers and passengers \n6  arrested were Latino even in predominantly White areas.

As a result of evidence of a pattern and practice of civil rights violations, \n11  MCSO is currently the subject of a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of \n12  Justice. \n13  160. Demonstrating that the intent of SB 1070, as amended by HB 2162, is to \n14  enable pretextual stops and arrests for the purpose of immigration enforcement, State \n15  Senator Russell Pearce inadvertently circulated an email on April 28, 2010 which \n16  explained one provision of HB 2162 as follows:  “When we drop out ‘lawful contact’ and \n17  replace it with ‘a stop, detention, or rest [sic], in the enforcement a violation of any title or \n18  section of the Arizona code’ we need to add ‘or any county or municipal ordinance.’ This \n19  will allow police to use violations of property codes (i.e. cars on blocks in the yard) or \n20  rental codes (too many occupants of a rental accommodation) to initiate queries as well.”  \n21  Gabriel Winant, E-Mail Reveals Arizona Law Was Designed To Maximize Harassment, \n22  SALON, May 3, 2010, available at http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/ \n23  2010/05/03/arizona_kobach_profiling.  SB 1070 was intended to create opportunities for \n24  officers to determine which members of the community should be investigated as to their \n25  immigration status first, and then to develop a pretextual reason to stop them for some \n26  other violation of state or local law second. \n  -51-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 52 of 61\n \n1  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n2  161. The Individual Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other \n3  persons similarly situated pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  \n4  The class, as proposed by Plaintiffs, consists of all persons: \n5  (a) who as a result of their race or national origin are or will be subject to \n6  stop,  detention,  arrest  or  questioning  about  their  immigration  or \n7  nationality status or required to produce documentation of that status, \n8  pursuant to a provision of SB 1070; or \n9  (b) who are or will be deterred from soliciting employment in a public place \n10  or performing work as an employee or independent contractor by § 5 of \nSB 1070; or \n11 \n(c) who are or will be deterred from using their customary language, accent, \n12 \nor other expressive conduct, or from approaching government officials to \n13 \nobtain redress because of the provisions of SB 1070; or \n14 \n(d) who  are  or  will  be  deterred  from  living,  associating,  worshiping,  or \n15 \ntraveling with immigrants in Arizona because of the provisions of SB \n16 \n1070; or \n17 \n(e) who are or will be deterred from traveling into or through the State of \n18 \nArizona because of the provisions of SB 1070. \n19 \n162. The requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) are \n20 \nmet in that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.    \n21 \n163. There are questions of law and fact common to the proposed class, including: \n22 \n(1) whether SB 1070 is preempted by the U.S. Constitution and federal law; (2) whether \n23 \nSB 1070 deprives racial and national origin minorities of the equal protection of the laws \n24 \nwithin the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; (3) whether \n25 \nSB 1070 violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; (4) whether SB 1070 \n26 \nviolates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 2, Section 8 of the \n  -52-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 53 of 61\n \n1  Arizona Constitution; and (5) whether SB 1070 is impermissibly vague and violates due \n2  process of law.  These questions predominate over any questions affecting only the \n3  Individual Plaintiffs. \n4  164. The claims of the Individual Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the proposed \n5  class.  \n6  165. All of the Individual Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests \n7  of all members of the proposed class because they seek relief on behalf of the class as a \n8  whole and have no interests antagonistic to other members of the class.  The Individual \n9  Plaintiffs are also represented by pro bono counsel, including the ACLU of Arizona, the \n10  ACLU Foundation Immigrants’ Rights Project, the Mexican American Legal Defense and \n11  Educational Fund, the National Immigration Law Center, the Asian Pacific American \n12  Legal Center (a member of the Asian American Center for Advancing Justice), the \n13  National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the National Association for the \n14  Advancement of Colored People, Altshuler Berzon LLP, and Munger, Tolles & Olson \n15  LLP, who have extensive expertise in class action litigation, including litigation regarding \n16  the rights of immigrants.  Finally, Defendants have acted and will act on grounds \n17  generally applicable to the class in executing their duties to enforce SB 1070, thereby \n18  making appropriate final injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n19  // \n20  // \n21  DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALLEGATIONS \n22  166. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants \n23  as to their respective legal rights and duties.  Plaintiffs contend that they face an imminent \n24  threat of harm if SB 1070 is enforced, and that SB 1070 violates the U.S. Constitution, \n25  federal law, and state law.  Defendants are obligated to enforce SB 1070 unless it is found \n26  to be illegal. \n  -53-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 54 of 61\n \n1  167. In violating Plaintiffs’ rights under the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and state \n2  law, Defendants have acted and will be acting under color of law. \n3  168. If allowed to go into effect, SB 1070 will cause irreparable injury to Plaintiffs. \n4  169. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law against SB 1070 \n5  other than the relief requested in this Complaint. \n6  170. Article IV, part 1, § 1(3) of the Arizona Constitution provides that “no act \n7  passed by the legislature shall be operative for ninety days after the close of the session of \n8  the legislature enacting such measure,” except certain specifically designated “emergency \n9  measures.”  The legislative session during which SB 1070 and HB 2162 were enacted \n10  ended on April 29, 2010.  Accordingly, the effective date of SB 1070 is July 28, 2010. \n11  171. If SB 1070 goes into effect and is not enjoined, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable \n12  harm as alleged above.  \n13  172. SB 1070 will require persons in the state to carry immigration registration \n14  documents under state law to avoid detention, arrest, and possible prosecution.  In \n15  addition, SB 1070 will cause the investigation, detention, harassment, and arrest of \n16  numerous persons of color in Arizona, including members of Plaintiffs UFCW, BAN, \n17  Tonatierra, SEIU, SEIU Arizona, MAS, and JACL, as well as Individual Plaintiffs Pedro \n18  Espinoza, C.M., Luz Santiago, Jim Shee, Jose Vargas, Maura Castillo, Maria Morales, \n19  John Doe #1, Jane Doe #3, and members of the plaintiff class. \n20  173. In addition, SB 1070 will thwart the mission of and subject to criminal \n21  prosecution numerous service and business organizations, including Plaintiffs Friendly \n22  House, ASASF, AZHCC, Valle del Sol, and Derechos Humanos. \n23  174. In doing the things alleged in this Complaint, defendants will deny plaintiffs’ \n24  rights secured by the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and state law.   \n25  175. Defendants’ implementation of SB 1070 will constitute an official policy of \n26  their respective jurisdictions. \n  -54-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 55 of 61\n \n1  176. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that SB 1070 is unconstitutional on its \n2  face and to an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining its enforcement. \n3  CAUSES OF ACTION \n4  COUNT ONE \n5  SUPREMACY CLAUSE; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n6  177. The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n7  forth herein. \n8  178. The Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution \n9  provides: \n \n10  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made \nin Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under \n11  the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; \nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the \n12  Constitution of Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. \n \n13 \n179. The Supremacy Clause mandates that federal law preempts state law in any \n14 \narea over which Congress expressly or impliedly has reserved exclusive authority or \n15 \nwhich is constitutionally reserved to the federal government, or where state law conflicts \n16 \nor interferes with federal law. \n17 \n180. SB 1070 is void in its entirety because it attempts to bypass federal \n18 \nimmigration law and to supplant it with a state policy of “attrition through enforcement,” \n19 \nin violation of the prohibition on state regulation of immigration. \n20 \n181. SB 1070 conflicts with federal laws and policies, usurps powers \n21 \nconstitutionally vested in the federal government exclusively, attempts to legislate in \n22 \nfields occupied by the federal government, imposes burdens and penalties on legal \n23 \nresidents not authorized by and contrary to federal law, and unilaterally imposes burdens \n24 \non the federal government’s resources and processes, each in violation of the Supremacy \n25 \nClause.   \n26 \n  -55-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 56 of 61\n \n1  182. Plaintiffs move for declaratory and injunctive relief on this claim directly \n2  under the Constitution, and as an action seeking redress of the deprivation of statutory \n3  rights under the color of state law, and also under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n4   COUNT TWO \n5  EQUAL PROTECTION; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n6  183. The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n7  forth herein. \n8  184. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that “No State \n9  shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \n10  185. SB 1070 was enacted with the purpose and intent to discriminate against racial \n11  and national origin minorities, including Latinos, on the basis of race and national origin. \n12  186. SB 1070 impermissibly and invidiously targets Plaintiffs who are racial and \n13  national origin minorities, including Latinos, residing or traveling in Arizona and subjects \n14  them to stops, detentions, questioning, and arrests because of their race and/or national \n15  origin.  \n16  187. SB 1070 impermissibly deprives Plaintiffs who are racial and national origin \n17  minorities, including Latinos, residing or traveling in Arizona of the equal protection of \n18  the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n19  188. Section 3 of SB 1070 impermissibly discriminates against non-citizen \n20  Plaintiffs on the basis of alienage and deprives them of the equal protection of the laws \n21  within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n  -56-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 57 of 61\n \n1  COUNT THREE \n2  FIRST AMENDMENT; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n[COUNT THREE HAS BEEN DISMISSED IN PART PURSUANT TO COURT ORDER. \n3 \nPLAINTIFFS THUS DELETE THE RELEVANT ALLEGATIONS BUT PRESERVE THEIR APPEAL \n4  RIGHTS.] \n5  189. The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n6 \n7  190. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress shall \nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people peaceably \n8 \nto assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”  The First \n9 \nAmendment’s guarantees are applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n10 \n11  191. Sections 5(A) and (B) of SB 1070 are unconstitutional restrictions of rights \nguaranteed by the First Amendment. \n12 \nCOUNT FOUR \n13 \nFOURTH AMENDMENT; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n14 \n[COUNT FOUR HAS BEEN DISMISSED IN PART PURSUANT TO COURT ORDER.

The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n17  forth herein. \n18  193. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits “unreasonable \n19  searches and seizures.”  The Fourth Amendment’s guarantees are applied to the States \n20  through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n21  194. Section 2 of SB 1070, as amended by Section 3 of HB 2162, requires that \n22  officers conduct unreasonable seizures of individuals in violation of the Fourth \n23  Amendment.  \n24  195. Sections 2 and 6 of SB 1070 provide for warrantless seizures of individuals in \n25  the absence of probable cause that they have committed crimes, in violation of the Fourth \n26  Amendment. \n  -57-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 58 of 61\n \n1  196.

The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n7 \nforth herein. \n8 \n198. Article 2, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution provides: “No person shall be \n9 \ndisturbed in private affairs...without authority of law.” \n10 \n199. In addition, SB 1070 provides for warrantless seizures of individuals in the \n11 \nabsence of probable cause that they have committed crimes.   \n12 \n200. Moreover, SB 1070 extends this broad, warrantless arrest authority to the \n13 \ncontext of an individual's home. \n14 \nCOUNT SIX  \n15 \nDUE PROCESS; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n16  [COUNT SIX HAS BEEN DISMISSED IN PART PURSUANT TO COURT ORDER.

The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n18 \nforth herein. \n19 \n202. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides: “No State shall \n20 \n. . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . ..”  \n21 \n203. Section 2 of SB 1070 permits state and local law enforcement officials to seize, \n22 \ndetain, and transfer individuals without appropriate procedures, thereby depriving \n23 \nPlaintiffs of their liberty without due process of law. \n24 \n204. Section 6 of SB 1070 is vague and violates due process.  The terms “public \n25 \noffense” and “removable” do not provide meaningful standards and vest officers with \n26 \nunbridled discretion to make arbitrary and discriminatory arrests.  \n  -58-   \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 511   Filed 10/31/11   Page 59 of 61\n \n1  COUNT SEVEN \n2  SECTION 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n3  205. The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n4  forth herein. \n5  206. Section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code guarantees that “[a]ll \n6  persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State \n7  and Territory . . . to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security \n8  of persons and property.”  Section 1981 also provides that all persons “shall be subject to \n9  like punishments, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no \n10  other.”   \n11  207. Section 1981 prohibits discrimination under color of state law on the basis of \n12  alienage, national origin, and race. \n13  208. SB 1070 impermissibly discriminates against persons within the State of \n14  Arizona on the basis of alienage and national origin and race. \n15  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n16  WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing facts and arguments, Plaintiffs request that the \n17  Court: \n18  a.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiffs move the Court for a preliminary injunction as to §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) \n3  of the Arizona Revised Statutes in order to halt the ongoing deprivation of First \n4  Amendment rights to individuals – day laborers and employers – at risk of prosecution \n5  under these provisions.    \n6  The First Amendment guarantees all members of society the right to free \n7  expression.  Solicitation speech is expression entitled to full protection under the First \n8  Amendment.  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) of the Arizona Revised Statutes are content-\n9  based speech restrictions because they impose statewide criminal liability on motorists \n10  and individuals based on individuals’ employment solicitation speech.  Plaintiffs are likely \n11  to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claims against A.R.S. §§ 13-2928 (A) \n12  and (B) because, as content-based restrictions, they are subject to strict scrutiny and \n13  Defendants cannot show that they survive that test.   \n14  Preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to halt Plaintiffs’ ongoing irreparable \n15  injury due to the unconstitutional restriction of their right to free speech; the improper \n16  chilling of their expressive activity; and these sections’ effect on day laborers’ livelihood \n17  and their ability to support themselves and their families.  Given the severity of these \n18  harms to Plaintiffs, the balance of the equities tips sharply in their favor, especially \n19  because Arizona has ample existing means at its disposal by which to address any \n20  purported traffic safety interests.  Finally, given the fundamental constitutional liberties at \n21  stake, injunctive relief is in the public interest.  For these reasons, immediate interim relief \n22  is necessary during the pendency of this lawsuit. \n23  II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n24  Plaintiffs filed this action on May 17, 2010 challenging major provisions of \n25  Arizona Senate Bill 1070, as amended (“SB 1070”), that together purport to create an \n26  immigration policy of “attrition through enforcement” in the State of Arizona.  Plaintiffs \n27  assert in their Complaint that the provisions on their face violate the Constitution, \n28  including the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  On June 4, 2010, Plaintiffs \n \n  1  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 9 of 29\n \n1  moved for a preliminary injunction of the challenged provisions pursuant to a number of \n2  their claims.  At the Court's June 22, 2010 hearing, Plaintiffs withdrew their preliminary \n3  injunction motion with respect to §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) in light of the Ninth Circuit's \n4  ruling in Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 607 F.3d \n5  1178 (9th Cir. 2010).  Since that time, however, the Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en \n6  banc in that case and ordered the panel's ruling not citable within this Circuit.  See Comite \n7  De Jornaleros De Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 623 F.3d 1054 (9th Cir. \n8  2010).  In addition, as this Court determined, the ordinance at issue in Redondo Beach is \n9  distinguishable from §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B), which specifically target employment \n10  solicitation speech.  Friendly House v. Whiting, No. 10-01061 (D. Ariz. Oct. 8, 2010) \n11  (order granting in part and den. in part defs.’ motions to dismiss and den. plts’ mot. for \n12  prelim. inj.) (hereinafter “Oct. 8, 2010 Order”).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs now seek a \n13  preliminary injunction of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).   \n14  III.  STANDARD \n15  Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction to suspend enforcement of §§ 13-\n16  2928 (A) and (B).  A preliminary injunction should be granted when the moving party \n17  establishes: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that he is likely to suffer \n18  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips \n19  in his favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  See Sierra Forest Legacy \n20  v. Rey, 577 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Winters v. Natural Resources Defense \n21  Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008)).  “The same standard applies regardless of \n22  whether the movant seeks to maintain the status quo or to halt an ongoing deprivation of \n23  rights.”  Klein v. City of Laguna Beach, 381 F. App’x 723, 725 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing \n24  Textile Unlimited, Inc. v. A..BMH & Co., 240 F.3d 781, 786 (9th Cir. 2001)).  Plaintiffs \n25  meet these elements here.      \n26   \n27   \n28   \n \n  2  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 10 of 29\n \n1  IV.  ARGUMENT \n2   \n  A.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claim That \n3 \nSections 13-2928 (A) and (B) Violate the First Amendment.  \n4   \nAs this Court already observed in this case, §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) are content-\n5 \nbased regulations of speech that are subject to strict scrutiny.  Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 20.  \n6 \nSee also Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 660 (2004).  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) fail \n7 \nto survive strict scrutiny because Defendants cannot meet their burden of showing that the \n8 \nregulations “serve[] a compelling government interest in the least restrictive manner \n9 \npossible.” See Berger v. City of Seattle, 569 F.3d 1029, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).  \n10 \nAs such, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims are likely to succeed on the merits.   \n11 \n \n12 \n1.  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) are unconstitutional content-based  \n13 \n  regulations of protected speech.  \n14  A.R.S. §§13-2928 (A) and (B), portions of SB 1070, unlawfully regulate protected \n15  speech in a public forum on the basis of its content.  See Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. \n16  191, 196-97 (1992).  On their face, §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) specifically suppress speech \n17  soliciting work – in particular day labor solicitation speech – which is entitled to full \n18  constitutional protection.  ACLU of Nevada v. City of Las Vegas, 466 F.3d 784, 792 (9th \n19  Cir. 2006) (“ACLU II”); see also Berger, 569 F.3d at 1050.  These sections restrict \n20  persons from engaging in work solicitation speech on all streets throughout the State of \n21  Arizona, which are “quintessential public for[a]” that have “‘by long tradition . . . been \n22  devoted to assembly and debate.’”  Burson, 504 U.S. at 196-97 (citations omitted).  In \n23  such public fora, the government’s ability to restrict speech is “very limited.”  United \n24  States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983). \n25  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) single out particular content of communication \n26  between a motorist and the person that he or she picks up for differential treatment.  \n27  Section 13-2928 (A) applies only to drivers who “attempt to hire or hire” workers, and § \n28 \n \n  3  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 11 of 29\n \n1  13-2928 (B) applies only to persons entering a car “in order to be hired.”  A.R.S. §§ 13-\n2  2928 (A) and (B).  Thus, the regulations target individuals engaging in speech that solicits \n3  work, and leave other speech – such as artistic, political, and religious speech – \n4  completely unrestricted.  See Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 20; Berger, 569 F.3d at 1051.  Indeed, \n5  as the Court explained in ruling that §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) are content-based, the \n6  provisions specifically target and “regulate[] only solicitation related to employment,” and \n7  not political or other forms of solicitation.  Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 20.   \n8  In its ruling issued on October 8, 2010, the Court correctly relied on Berger and \n9  ACLU II in determining that §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) “are content-based regulations of \n10  speech because the provisions ‘differentiate[] based on the content of speech,’ prohibiting \n11  only the solicitation of employment.”  Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 20.  In ACLU II, the Ninth \n12  Circuit held that a prohibition on handbills requesting financial assistance, but permitting \n13  those with other content, was a “content-based distinction because it single[d] out certain \n14  speech for differential treatment based on the idea expressed.”  466 F.3d at 793-94.  \n15  Similarly, in Berger, the en banc Court of Appeals held that an ordinance prohibiting \n16  street performers from soliciting donations, but not prohibiting the performers from \n17  communicating other messages, was a content-based regulation of speech.  Berger, 569 \n18  F.2d at 1051.  The Berger court explained that “[a] regulation is content-based if either the \n19  underlying purpose of the regulation is to suppress particular ideas, or if the regulation, by \n20  its very terms, singles out particular content for differential treatment.”  Id.  (emphasis \n21  added) (citation omitted). \n22  “Importantly, [§§ 13-2928 (A) and (B)’s] provisions are directed only at \n23  employment solicitation and not more broadly at the act of solicitation.”  Oct. 8, 2010 \n24  Order at 20.  The Court further noted that “[a]lthough courts have held that bans on the act \n25  of solicitation are content-neutral, [they] have not found any case holding that a regulation \n26  that separates out words of solicitation for differential treatment is content-neutral.”  Id. \n27  (citing ACLU II, 466 F.3d at 794).  Like the solicitation restriction at issue in Berger, §§ \n28  13-2928 (A) and (B) restrict “the medium and manner of” soliciting “based on the content \n \n  4  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 12 of 29\n \n1  of the [speaker’s] message.”  Berger, 569 F.3d at 1051.  Indeed, “even though some \n2  manner of communication on the subject is allowed[,]” “regulat[ing] the manner of speech \n3  on the basis of content, tak[es] the regulation outside the time, place, and manner \n4  rubric[.]”  Id.  Accordingly, §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) are content-based speech restrictions \n5  regardless of whether they “may be . . . directed at conduct, . . . [because] the conduct \n6  triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.”  Holder v. \n7  Humanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 2724 (2010).1  \n8  The Court’s conclusion that §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) are content-based is further \n9  supported “by the fact that an officer seeking to enforce [the solicitation restrictions] \n10  ‘must necessarily examine the content of the message that is conveyed.’”  Berger, 569 \n11  F.3d at 1052 (quoting Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 134 \n12  (1992)).  See also S.O.C., Inc. v. County of Clark, 152 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir. 1998) \n13  (that an official must necessarily examine the content of the message that is conveyed in \n14  order to enforce the regulation is the hallmark of a content-based regulation); Glendale \n15  Assocs., Ltd. v. NLRB, 347 F.3d 1145, 1155 (9th Cir. 2003) (same).  As the Supreme \n16  Court recently explained, a law is a content-based regulation of speech where criminal \n17  liability “depends on what [individuals] say.”  Humanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. at \n18  2723-2724.     \n19  Here, enforcement of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) necessarily requires an examination \n20  of the content of the communication between an individual and occupant of a vehicle.   \n21  Law enforcement officers are required to determine the content of the message conveyed, \n22  since liability accrues only when individuals engage in speech about employment \n23  solicitation.  An enforcing officer must determine whether, for instance, a motorist \n24  responded to a political solicitation (permitted),  a homeless person soliciting alms \n25  (permitted), or instead to a person soliciting employment (prohibited).  S.O.C., 152 F.3d at \n                                                 \n26  1   Nor does the mere assertion of purported traffic and safety concerns lessen the \ncontent-based nature of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).  See ACLU II, 466 F.3d at 793 (“[T]he \n27  mere assertion of a content-neutral purpose [is not] enough to save a law which, on its \nface, discriminates based on content.”) (quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., 512 \n28  U.S. 622, 642-42 (1994)). \n \n  5  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 13 of 29\n \n1  1145 (noting, in holding ordinance content-based, that enforcing officer “would need to \n2  examine the contents of the handbill to determine whether its distribution was \n3  prohibited”); see also Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, 507 U.S. 410, 429 (1993).  \n4  Similarly, pedestrians in Arizona can engage in any speech with motorists, and in any \n5  manner, without running afoul of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B), as long as the speech does not \n6  constitute employment solicitation.  Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 20.  Cf. ACLU II, 466 F.3d at \n7  794; Humanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. at 2722-24.    \n8  This selective liability based on a particular subject of speech also evidences \n9  Arizona’s attempt to chill the expression and communication of one particular set of \n10  constitutionally protected ideas.  See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 394 \n11  (1992).  “Selectivity of this sort creates the possibility that the [government] is seeking to \n12  handicap the expression of particular ideas.”  Id.  While Arizona may enact legislation \n13  aimed at ensuring traffic safety, it cannot do so in a way that is designed to impose \n14  “special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects” \n15  without the regulation becoming a constitutionally suspect content-based restriction on \n16  speech.  Id. at 391.2  \n17  Because liability under §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) “depends on what [individuals] \n18  say” when they communicate with a motorist, Humanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. at \n19  2723-24, “the very basis for the regulation is the difference in content [,]”Discovery \n20                                                   \n2   The original bill, later codified as §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B), is HB 2042, titled \n21 \n“unlawful roadside solicitation of employment.”  HB 2042 was duplicated into and heard \nconcurrently with SB 1070.  The testimony of HB 2042’s sponsor, State Representative \n22 \nKavanagh, evidences that these provisions sought to suppress day labor solicitation \n23  speech.  Boyd Decl., Ex. 24 (filed in support of Pls’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. on June 21, \n2010, Docket No. 235), Kavanagh testimony Feb. 24, 2010 (“No one benefits from \n24 \nroadside solicitation of day labor” and there are “other ways decent people can get jobs, \n25  and certainly standing on the street like a hooker isn’t one of them.”); Id. at. Ex. 31, Jan. \n21, 2010 House Judiciary Comm. hearing (Kavanagh testifying that the law is necessary \n26 \nbecause “large congregations of almost exclusively men hang[] around in communities, \n[and it] is a problem — it’s unsightly, it’s intimidating, especially to people on the street, \n27 \nparticularly women. . . .”).  The underlying purpose of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) is clearly \n28  aimed at suppressing day labor solicitation speech.   \n \n  6  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 14 of 29\n \n1  Network, 507 U.S. at 429.  See also Burson, 504 U.S. at 197; Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. \n2  455, 462 (1980).                   \n3  2.  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) cannot survive strict scrutiny.  \n4  Strict scrutiny applies here, because, “[a]s . . . content-based regulation[s], \n5  [Sections] 13-2928 (A) and (B) [are] only valid if [they] ‘serve[] a compelling \n6  government interest in the least restrictive manner possible.’”  Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 20 \n7  (quoting Berger, 569 F.3d at 1053).  If a less restrictive alternative would achieve that \n8  interest, the Defendants “must use that alternative.”  See United States v. Playboy \n9  Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).  “A court should not assume a \n10  plausible, less restrictive alternative would be ineffective.”  Id. at 824. \n11  Although traffic safety can be a recognized significant interest, Kuba v. 1-A Agr. \n12  Ass'n, 387 F.3d 850, 858 (9th Cir. 2004), here, there are numerous state and local laws \n13  readily available to Defendants that address traffic flow and public safety issues caused by \n14  the interference with traffic.  See e.g., A.R.S. § 28-905 (“A person shall not open a door \n15  on a motor vehicle unless it . . . can be done without interfering with the movement of \n16  other traffic.”); A.R.S. §§ 13-2906(A) (imposing a maximum 30-day jail sentence if \n17  person “recklessly interferes with the passage of any highway or public thoroughfare by \n18  creating an unreasonable inconvenience or hazard”); see also 28-871(A); 28-704(A); 28-\n19  873(A).  Accordingly, Defendants cannot show that §§13-2928 (A) and (B) are the least \n20  restrictive means to achieve purported traffic safety interests because they could easily \n21  rely on the myriad existing laws that directly regulate behavior by pedestrians or drivers \n22  that disrupts traffic safety.  See Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 329 (1988) (holding statute \n23  was not narrowly tailored because “a less restrictive alternative is readily available”).  \n24  Defendants may enforce these laws, which allow them to combat threats to traffic flow \n25  and public safety that they may assert an interest in eliminating, without \n26  unconstitutionally impinging on the protected speech that §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) \n27  prohibit.  \n28  Based on the foregoing reasons, and as further explained below, §§13-2928 (A) \n \n  7  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 15 of 29\n \n1  and (B) cannot survive strict scrutiny. \n2    3.  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) cannot meet intermediate scrutiny. \n3  While Defendants may argue that Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) should be subject \n4  to intermediate scrutiny, the restrictions fail even that test because Defendants cannot \n5  show that they do not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further \n6  significant governmental interests.  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 \n7  (1989); see Edwards v. City of Santa Barbara, 150 F.3d 1213, 1216 (9th Cir. 1998).  \n8  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) must “target[] and eliminate[] no more than the exact source \n9  of the ‘evil’ [they] seek[] to remedy.”  Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485.  See also \n10  Berger, 569 F.3d at 1041.  Thus, to meet their burden of establishing the constitutionality \n11  of these laws, Defendants must show a “reasonable fit” between their asserted interest and \n12  the terms of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).  See S.O.C., 152 F.3d at 1148.  As part of this \n13  showing, Defendants must demonstrate “that in enacting the particular limitations . . . [the \n14  State] relied upon evidence permitting the reasonable inference that absent such \n15  limitations,” the proscribed speech would cause harmful effects.  Tollis, Inc. v. San \n16  Bernardino County, 827 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir. 1987).  “[T]he existence of obvious, \n17  less burdensome alternatives is ‘a relevant consideration in determining whether the ‘fit’ \n18  between the ends and means is reasonable.’” Berger, 569 F.3d at 1041 (quoting Discovery \n19  Network, 507 U.S. at 417 n. 13).   \n20  Defendants cannot meet this “evidentiary requirement” to prove that their interest \n21  in protecting against traffic hazards justifies the prohibitions of §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).  \n22  See Klein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d 1196, 1202 (9th Cir. 2009).  “As both [the \n23  Ninth Circuit] and the Supreme Court have repeatedly emphasized, ‘merely invoking \n24  interests . . . is insufficient.’”  Id. (quoting Kuba, 387 F.3d at 859).  Rather, “’[t]he \n25  Government must . . . show that the [prohibited] communicative activity endangers those \n26  interests.’”  Id.  “There must be evidence in the record to support a determination that the \n27  restriction [on speech] is reasonable.”  Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 303 F.3d \n28  959, 967 (9th Cir. 2002).  Cf., S.O.C., 152 F.3d at 1146.  Here, even if Defendants have \n \n  8  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 16 of 29\n \n1  some evidence that in the past an individual solicitor and prospective employer obstructed \n2  traffic and posed a safety threat somewhere in Arizona, it is not enough to justify the \n3  extraordinary and unprecedented statewide blanket restriction on employment solicitation \n4  speech imposed by §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).  See Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights \n5  of Los Angeles v. Burke, 2000 WL 1481467, *9 (C.D. Cal. 2000).  “A governmental body \n6  seeking to sustain a restriction must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real.”  See \n7  Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770-71 (1993); see also Berger, 569 F.3d at 1049.  \n8  Defendants cannot demonstrate that the speech prohibited by §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) \n9  actually endangers asserted traffic interests throughout the State of Arizona.  Accordingly, \n10  Defendants fail to meet their burden of proving that the challenged restrictions are \n11  narrowly tailored.   \n12  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) further fail to pass constitutional muster under \n13  intermediate scrutiny because there are “obvious, less burdensome alternatives” available \n14  to meet Defendants’ purported interests.  See Berger, 569 F.3d at 1041 (quoting Discovery \n15  Network, 507 U.S. at 417 n. 13).  As explained, Defendants have a number of existing, \n16  conventional laws whose very purpose is to address traffic and other legitimate concerns, \n17  further evidencing the overbreadth of the laws.  “[T]he availability of [these] obvious less-\n18  restrictive alternatives” demonstrates that these provisions “burden[] substantially more \n19  speech than is necessary to achieve [their] purposes,” and are therefore not narrowly \n20  tailored.  See Galvin v. Hay, 374 F.3d 739, 753 (9th Cir. 2004). \n21  Moreover, there is no credible argument that there is a governmental interest \n22  sufficient to justify harsher penalties for individuals who impede traffic because they are \n23  engaging in day labor solicitation than for other individuals who may cause a similar \n24  impediment to traffic for other reasons.  Cf., Grace, 461 U.S. at 182 (holding that a greater \n25  restriction on speech on public sidewalks surrounding the Supreme Court but not other \n26  public sidewalks could not be justified in the absence of a governmental interest \n27  necessitating the increased regulation).  Arizona state laws that already regulate conduct \n28  that creates traffic hazards carry civil penalties and minimal jail sentences.  See e.g., \n \n  9  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 17 of 29\n \n1  A.R.S. § 28-873(A) (imposing civil penalties for actions that may impede traffic); A.R.S. \n2  § 13-2906(A) (imposing a maximum thirty-day jail sentence if person “recklessly \n3  interferes with the passage of any highway or public thoroughfare by creating an \n4  unreasonable inconvenience or hazard”); see A.R.S. § 13-707(A).  In contrast, violations \n5  of §§13-2928 (A) and (B) carry a potential six-month jail sentence for “impeding traffic.”  \n6  Thus, a person who recklessly interferes with traffic while proselytizing to a motorist \n7  faces a jail sentence of thirty days.  See A.R.S. § 13-2906(A).  However, a person who \n8  recklessly interferes with traffic while soliciting employment from a motorist faces a jail \n9  sentence of six months.  Defendants cannot justify the disproportionate criminal sanction \n10  imposed by §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) only on individuals who engage in employment \n11  solicitation speech.  Accordingly, §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) burden substantially more \n12  speech than is necessary to further significant governmental interests and necessarily fail \n13  even under intermediate scrutiny.   \n14  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that §§ 13-\n15  2928 (A)’s and (B)’s employment solicitation speech restrictions violate the First \n16  Amendment.   \n17  B.  Plaintiffs Are Suffering Irreparable Harm. \n18  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) infringe on Plaintiffs’ free speech rights, causing \n19  them irreparable injury and warranting issuance of a preliminary injunction. 3  See Klein, \n20  584 F.3d at 1207 (finding irreparable injury where plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of \n21  success on the merits of his claims “[g]iven the free speech protections at issue in th[e] \n22  case”).  “[A] party seeking preliminary injunctive relief in a First Amendment context can \n23  establish irreparable injury sufficient to merit the grant of relief by demonstrating the \n24  existence of a colorable First Amendment claim.”  Sammartano, 303 F.3d at 973 (internal \n25                                                   \n3   Because Plaintiffs Southside and Tonatierra have filed this lawsuit, in part, on \n26  behalf of their members, the irreparable injury suffered by their members may be \nconsidered.

Plaintiffs’ likely success on the merits of their First Amendment \n15  challenge to §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) alone is sufficient to establish irreparable injury.  See \n16  Klein, 584 F.3d at 1207.   \n17  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ day laborer members and individual day laborers are \n18  chilled and are refraining from soliciting employment in the manner proscribed by §§ 13-\n19  2928 (A) and (B) to avoid enforcement against them.  See Declaration of Alison \n20  Harrington in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. of A.R.S. §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) \n21  (“Harrington Decl.”) at ¶¶ 10, 11; Declaration of Tupac Enrique in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for \n22  Prelim. Inj. of A.R.S. §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) (“Enrique Decl.”) at ¶¶ 10-14.  Some day \n23  laborer members have altogether ceased soliciting work in public rights-of-way, and \n24  others are decreasing the number of days and the manner in which they do so.  Harrington \n25  Decl. at ¶¶ 10-12; Enrique Decl. at ¶ 10 (Since these provisions took effect, “[s]ome \n26  jornalero members have ceased soliciting work in public entirely and others have cut \n27  down on the number of days that they solicit work in public because they are afraid of \n28  being arrested under Section 5(b) of S.B. 1070.”). \n \n  11  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 19 of 29\n \n1  The day laborers fear being subjected to criminal sanctions, including \n2  imprisonment, imposed by §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B), further evidencing irreparable harm \n3  under First Amendment doctrine.  See Harrington Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12; Enrique Decl. ¶¶ 10-14.  \n4  This fear has exacerbated among Plaintiff Tonatierra’s day laborer members following the \n5  publication of a news article reporting Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s intent to \n6  enforce § 13-2928.  Enrique Decl. ¶¶ 12-14.  On November 7, 2010, the Arizona Republic \n7  published an article quoting Sheriff Arapio as stating that he “[is] going to enforce one \n8  part of [S.B. 1070] about picking up laborers [because] [t]hat part wasn’t thrown out.”  Id. \n9  at ¶12, Exh. A.  Plaintiff Tonatierra’s day laborer members soon thereafter learned about \n10  Sheriff Arpaio’s reported threat to enforce § 13-2928, causing even greater fear that they \n11  will be arrested if they solicit work in the manner proscribed by §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).  \n12  Id. at ¶ 13.  Indeed, another Arizona District Court has previously found irreparable injury \n13  with respect to a similar ban on speech related to day labor adopted by the town of Cave \n14  Creek, Arizona.  Lopez  v. Town of Cave Creek, 559 F. Supp. 2d 1030, 1036 (D. Ariz. \n15  2008) (enjoining city ordinance that prohibited standing on a street to solicit employment \n16  from the occupant of any vehicle).  The result should be no different here.   \n17  The solicitation prohibitions imposed by §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) also subject day \n18  laborers to severe economic hardship.  Cf. Satellite Television of New York Assoc. v. \n19  Finneran, 579 F. Supp. 1546, 1551-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (considering economic burden on \n20  party moving for preliminary injunction in evaluating irreparable harm and balance of \n21  hardships).  Most of Plaintiffs’ member day laborers rely on day work to sustain \n22  themselves and their families.  See Harrington Decl. ¶ 12; Enrique Decl. ¶ 15.  Day work \n23  is oftentimes the only available means for Plaintiffs’ member day laborers to obtain work \n24  and is critical to their livelihood.  Id.  Due to the restrictions and sanctions imposed by §§ \n25  13-2928 (A) and (B), the day laborer members have refrained from soliciting or modified \n26  the manner in which they solicit work in public rights-of-way, resulting in the reduction of \n27  income from their day labor and in severe economic hardship.  Id.  In addition, individuals \n28  who hire day laborers have indicated that they are reluctant to communicate publicly with \n \n  12  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 20 of 29\n \n1  day laborers about their need for day work due to fear they will be subjected to fines \n2  under §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B).  Harrington Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.  This reticence by employers \n3  has led to “less day work” and, as a result, “day laborer members are struggling to provide \n4  for themselves and their families.”  Id. at ¶13.   \n5  C.  The Equities Tip Decidedly in Plaintiffs’ Favor. \n6  The equities tip decidedly in Plaintiffs’ favor.  The hardship that Plaintiffs would \n7  suffer without injunctive relief is substantial.  See Harrington Decl. ¶ 12; Enrique Decl. ¶¶ \n8  15, 16.  Plaintiffs face the option of either refraining from exercising their free speech \n9  rights or risking criminal sanctions.  See Harrington Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12; Enrique Decl. ¶¶ 15, \n10  16.  If, despite their best efforts, they are arrested for violation of the law, they would \n11  suffer, at a minimum, the indignity and financial burden of arrest and incarceration.  Cf. \n12  Satellite Television of New York Assoc., 579 F. Supp. at 1552 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).   \n13  In contrast, the hardship to Defendants if the preliminary injunction were to issue is \n14  negligible at best.  If Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from enforcing §§13-2928 (A) \n15  and (B), they will continue to have the right to control traffic and pedestrian safety and \n16  protect public and private property by enforcing state statutes and municipal codes that \n17  regulate these matters.  Given these existing laws, Defendants are fully capable of \n18  addressing any problems allegedly caused by employment solicitors even if the Court \n19  enjoins §§13-2928 (A) and (B).  The balance of hardships, therefore, tips decidedly in \n20  favor of Plaintiffs, and an injunction should issue. \n21  D.  A Preliminary Injunction is in the Public Interest. \n22  The Ninth Circuit has “consistently recognized the significant public interest in \n23  upholding free speech principles.”  Klein, 584 F.3d at 1208 (quoting Sammartano, 303 \n24  F.3d at 974 (collecting cases) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, §§13-2928 (A) \n25  and (B) “would infringe not only the free expression interests of [Plaintiffs], but also the \n26  interests of other people subjected to the same restrictions.”  Id. (internal quotation marks \n27  omitted).  Here, §§ 13-2928 (A) and (B) restrict the ability of any potential speaker from \n28  expressing his need and availability to work or hire day labor, and thus infringe on the \n \n  13  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUCTION OF ARS §§13-2928(A) AND (B) \n   \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 457   Filed 01/07/11   Page 21 of 29\n \n1  free speech rights of anyone seeking to engage in speech in the manner prohibited by the \n2  laws.  Thus, issuing the preliminary injunction here would advance the public interest in \n3  upholding free speech. \n4  V.  CONCLUSION \n5  Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B) unconstitutionally infringe upon the right of day \n6  laborers to express their need and availability to work in a public forum.  Because “[t]he \n7  balance of equities and the public interest . . . tip sharply in favor of enjoining [Sections \n8  13-2928 (A) and (B),]” and Ninth Circuit “caselaw clearly favors granting preliminary \n9  injunctions” where the plaintiffs are “likely to succeed on the merits of [their] First \n10  Amendment claim[,]” the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion.  Klein, 584 F.3d at 1208. \n11  Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enjoin Defendants from \n12  enforcing A.R.S. Sections 13-2928 (A) and (B).  \n13   \n14  Dated: January 07, 2011      Respectfully Submitted, \n \n15 \n/s/ Victor Viramontes \n16  MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL \nDEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND \n17 \n \n/s/ Karen C.

These provisions raise First Amendment concerns\nbecause they restrict and penalize the commercial speech of\nday  laborers  and  those  who  would  hire  them.    Arizona\ndefends the provisions as traffic safety measures, designed to\npromote  the  safe  and  orderly  flow  of  traffic.    We\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 6 of 35\n6 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nacknowledge that Arizona has a real and substantial interest\nin traffic safety.  Arizona, however, has failed to justify a\nneed to serve that interest through targeting and penalizing\nday labor solicitation that blocks traffic, rather than directly\ntargeting those who create traffic hazards without reference\nto their speech, as currently proscribed under the State’s pre-\nexisting traffic laws.  Laws like this one that restrict more\nprotected  speech  than  is  necessary  violate  the  First\nAmendment.1\nArizona has also singled out day labor solicitation for a\nharsh penalty while leaving other types of solicitation speech\nthat blocks traffic unburdened.  Arizona defends this content-\nbased distinction by invoking the “unique” dangers posed by\nlabor  solicitation.    That  justification  is  only  minimally\nsupported  by  the  record  and,  tellingly,  S.B.  1070’s\nintroduction says nothing about traffic safety.  Rather it\nemphasizes that its purpose is to encourage self-deportation\nby stripping undocumented immigrants of their livelihood.\nAdopting content-based restrictions for reasons apparently\nunrelated to traffic safety further supports the conclusion that\nthe day labor provisions restrict more speech than necessary.\nAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin concluding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the\nmerits of their First Amendment challenge to the day labor\nprovisions.  We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\na preliminary injunction barring their enforcement.\n     1  S.B.  1070  contains  other  provisions that,  although  they were\nchallenged in the same underlying district court action, are not at issue in\nthis appeal.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 7 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 7\nBACKGROUND\nThe two provisions challenged here were included as part\nof Section 5 of Arizona’s recent comprehensive immigration\nreform  bill,  S.B.  1070.    See  Ariz.    Rev.  Stat.  §§  13-\n2928(A)–(B) (Sections 5(A) and (B), collectively the day\nlabor provisions).  Section 5(A) makes it a crime for an\noccupant of a motor vehicle to solicit or hire a day laborer if\nthe motor vehicle blocks or impedes traffic.  Section 5(B)\nmakes it a crime for a day laborer to enter a motor vehicle to\nwork at a different location if the motor vehicle blocks or\nimpedes traffic.2  Following several years of deliberation, the\nArizona  House  of  Representatives  passed  the  day  labor\nprovisions in February 2010 as a standalone bill.  State\nRepresentative  John  Kavanagh,  the  provisions’  principal\nlegislative  sponsor,  said  at  committee  hearings  that  the\nprovisions  would  promote  traffic  safety  but  would  also\ndiscourage the “shadow economy” of day labor and address\nillegal immigration because “[a] large number of these people\n   2 Specifically, the day labor provisions state:\nA.  It is unlawful for an occupant of a motor\nvehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway\nto attempt to hire or hire and pick up passengers for\nwork at a different location if the motor vehicle blocks\nor impedes the normal movement of traffic.\nB.  It is unlawful for a person to enter a motor\nvehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway\nin order to be hired by an occupant of the motor vehicle\nand to be transported to work at a different location if\nthe  motor  vehicle  blocks  or  impedes  the  normal\nmovement of traffic.\nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 13-2928(A)-(B).\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 8 of 35\n8 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nare illegal immigrants and this is the way they get work, and\nthis work is one of the anchors that  keeps them in the\ncountry.”  After the day labor provisions passed the Arizona\nHouse of Representatives, the Arizona Senate adopted them\nas an amendment to S.B. 1070, an omnibus immigration bill.\nS.B. 1070 includes a purposes clause, common to all\nsections of the bill, which states that the “intent of [S.B.\n1070] is to make attrition through enforcement the public\npolicy of all state and local government agencies in Arizona”\nand that the “provisions of this act are intended to work\ntogether to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and\npresence  of  aliens  and  economic  activity  by  persons\nunlawfully present in the United States.”  See S.B. 1070, ch.\n113, 2010 Ariz. Sess. Laws § 1.\nIn May 2010, the plaintiffs filed suit in the District of\nArizona  seeking  a  declaration  that  S.B.  1070  is\nunconstitutional in its entirety.  The plaintiffs are various\norganizations and individuals affected by S.B. 1070.  The\ndefendants are various county officials as well as the state of\nArizona  and  Arizona  Governor  Janice  Brewer,  who\nintervened as defendants.  In June 2010, the plaintiffs moved\nfor  a  preliminary  injunction,  arguing  that  the  day  labor\nprovisions violate the First Amendment.  They renewed their\nmotion  in  October  2011,  after  we  held  in  Comite  de\nJornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach\n(Redondo Beach), 657 F.3d 936 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc),\nthat  a  Redondo  Beach  ordinance  restricting  all  roadside\nsolicitation violates the First Amendment.  See id. at 950–51\n(holding  that  the  restriction  inhibited  more  speech  than\nnecessary to serve the city’s goal of promoting traffic safety).\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 9 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 9\nThe district court issued a preliminary injunction barring\nenforcement of the day labor provisions in February 2012.\nThe key issue before the district court was whether the\nplaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their First\nAmendment claim.  The district court first held that Redondo\nBeach does  not  control this case because the day labor\nprovisions,  unlike  the  Redondo  Beach  ordinance,  are\nexplicitly limited to commercial speech.  The court then\nevaluated the day labor provisions under the four-pronged test\nfor restrictions on commercial speech the Supreme Court first\nset out in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public\nService Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980).\nUnder that test, we first evaluate whether the affected speech\nis misleading or related to unlawful activity.  See World Wide\nRush, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, 606 F.3d 676, 684 (9th Cir.\n2010) (quoting Metro Lights, L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles,\n551 F.3d 898, 903 (9th Cir. 2009)).  If not, the government\nbears the burden of showing that it has a substantial interest,\nthat the restriction directly advances that interest and that the\nrestriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the\ninterest.  See id.  The district court held that Sorrell v. IMS\nHealth, Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653 (2011), required it to apply a\nmore demanding version of the “not more extensive than\nnecessary” test to content-based restrictions on commercial\nspeech.  Finding the day labor provisions to be content-based,\nthe district court applied Sorrell and analyzed whether they\nwere “drawn to achieve” a substantial government interest.\nApplying Central Hudson’s threshold requirement that\nspeech be related to lawful activity and not misleading, the\ncourt  ruled  that  because  day  labor  is  lawful  activity,\nrestrictions  on  the  solicitation  of  day  labor  merit  First\nAmendment scrutiny.  Applying the “substantial interest”\nprong, the court credited Arizona’s uncontroverted assertion\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 10 of 35\n10 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nthat Arizona has a substantial government interest in traffic\nsafety.  Applying the “direct advancement” prong, the court\nconcluded that the day labor provisions directly advance that\ninterest because they prohibit traffic-blocking activity that\nwould otherwise take place.  Under the “not more extensive\nthan necessary” prong, however, the district court first held\nthat the day labor provisions are content-based restrictions\nand then held that the “[d]efendants have not shown that\n[they] . . . are drawn to achieve the substantial governmental\ninterest in traffic safety.”  On the contrary, the district court\nnoted,  the  ordinance  “appears  to  be  structured  to  target\nparticular speech rather than a broader traffic problem.”  The\ncourt cited the purposes clause of S.B. 1070 and the existence\nof  obvious  and  less-burdensome  alternatives  as  further\nevidence that the day labor provisions were not drawn to\nadvance Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.\nThe district court concluded that the plaintiffs are likely\nto succeed on the merits because the day labor provisions are\ninsufficiently tailored under Central Hudson’s fourth prong\nas  modified  by  Sorrell.    It  then  found  that  the  other\nrequirements for a preliminary injunction (irreparable harm,\nbalance of the equities and the public interest) were met and\ngranted a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the\nprovisions.  The intervenor defendants filed this interlocutory\nappeal.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n“A  plaintiff  seeking  a  preliminary  injunction  must\nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an\ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v.

We review an\norder  granting  a  preliminary  injunction  for  an  abuse  of\ndiscretion.  See Katie A. ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles County,\n481 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2007).  “Under this standard,\n[a]s long as the district court got the law right, it will not be\nreversed simply because the appellate court would have\narrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the\nfacts of the case.”  Thalheimer v. City of San Diego, 645 F.3d\n1109, 1115 (9th Cir. 2011) (alteration in original) (quoting\nDominguez v. Schwarzenegger, 596 F.3d 1087, 1092 (9th Cir.\n2010), vacated on other grounds by Douglas v. Indep. Living\nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1204 (2012)).  “This review is\nlimited  and  deferential,  and  it  does  not  extend  to  the\nunderlying merits of the case.”  Id. (quoting Johnson v.\nCouturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1078 (9th Cir. 2009)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  When the district court bases its\ndecision  on  an  erroneous  legal  standard,  we  review  the\nunderlying issues of law de novo.  See Flexible Lifeline Sys.,\nInc. v. Precision Lift, Inc., 654 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir. 2011)\n(per curiam).  “[W]hen a district court grants a preliminary\ninjunction  protecting  First  Amendment  rights,  ‘[i]f  the\nunderlying constitutional question is close . . . we should\nuphold the injunction and remand for trial on the merits.’”\nThalheimer, 645 F.3d at 1128 (second alteration in original)\n(quoting Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 664–65 (2004)).\nDISCUSSION\nDay laborers are those who, rather than having a fixed\nplace  of  employment,  perform  temporary  work  such  as\ngardening,  tree  trimming,  yard  clean-up,  moving,\nconstruction work, house cleaning and elder care.  Because\nsuch day laborers do not have a fixed place of employment,\nthey advertise their availability for employment by gathering\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 12 of 35\n12 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nin  a  visible  location  and  then  gesturing  to  motorists  or\notherwise communicating their availability to work.  Day\nlaborers  frequently  congregate  on  street  corners  and\nsidewalks, and those who would hire day laborers often stop\nin the road to negotiate terms and complete the hire.  The day\nlabor provisions restrict speech by penalizing the solicitation\nof day labor work when that solicitation impedes traffic.  The\nplaintiffs  introduced  declarations  showing  that,  after  the\nprovisions’ passage but before the district court enjoined\nenforcement, employers refrained from hiring day laborers on\npublic streets and day laborers refrained from soliciting work\nfrom the roadside out of fear of prosecution.\nArizona concedes that the day labor provisions restrict\nday laborers’ and would-be employers’ speech.  But it argues\nthe provisions are permissible because it is illegal to block\ntraffic and because day labor solicitation presents unique\ntraffic safety concerns that justify special treatment of such\nspeech  when  it  blocks  traffic.    Plaintiffs  counter  that\nArizona’s asserted interest in traffic safety is a sham; that the\ntrue purpose of the provisions is to remove day laborers from\npublic view and to suppress their economic opportunities.\nRegulations that inhibit speech must comport with the\nrequirements of the First Amendment.  We recognize that\nArizona has a significant interest in protecting the safe and\norderly flow of traffic on its streets.  We similarly credit\nArizona’s assertion that the roadside solicitation of labor may\ncreate dangerous traffic conditions.  The First Amendment\nrequires more than the invocation of a significant government\ninterest, however.  Rather, it requires that the restriction’s\nbenefits be balanced against the burden on protected speech.\nHow we conduct this balancing depends on what type of\nspeech is regulated and whether the regulation is content-\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 13 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 13\nbased or content-neutral.  We shall address these questions\nbefore turning to the ultimate question of whether Arizona’s\ninterest in traffic safety justifies its restriction on day labor\nsolicitation.\nI.\nThe district court correctly determined that the day labor\nprovisions  are  content-based  restrictions  on  commercial\nspeech.\nA.

Pittsburgh\nComm’n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 385 (1973)).\nSuch speech is protected by the First Amendment, but to a\nlesser degree than other types of speech.  See United States v.\nUnited Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 409 (2001) (“We have used\nstandards for determining the validity of speech regulations\nwhich accord less protection to commercial speech than to\nother expression.”).  A motorist who pulls over and either\nhires  or  attempts  to  hire  a  day  laborer  has  proposed  a\ncommercial transaction.3  By the same token, a day laborer\n   3 At oral argument, Arizona argued that the day labor provisions apply\nonly to consummated transactions and not to negotiations or attempts to\nhire a day laborer.  That argument is belied by the plain language of\nSection 5(A), which explicitly penalizes the “attempt to hire . . . and pick\nup passengers for work at a different location.”  We will not apply a\nlimiting construction that is contrary to the plain language of the statute.\nSee Bd. of Airport Comm’rs of L.A. v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569,\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 14 of 35\n14 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nsoliciting work from the roadside proposes a commercial\ntransaction.  Because the day labor provisions are explicitly\nlimited to attempts to hire, hiring, picking up and transporting\nworkers to work at a different location, all affected speech is\neither speech soliciting a commercial transaction or speech\nnecessary to the consummation of a commercial transaction.\nThe plaintiffs, however, argue that day labor solicitation\nspeech  is  “core”  First  Amendment  speech  because  it  is\ninextricably intertwined with core political and economic\nmessages.  See Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc.,\n487 U.S. 781, 796 (1988) (holding that commercial speech\ndoes  not  “retain[]  its  commercial  character  when  it  is\ninextricably  intertwined  with  otherwise  fully  protected\nspeech”).  Plaintiffs may be correct that day laborers convey\nvital political and economic messages when they solicit work\nfrom  the  side  of  the  road,  but  those  messages  are  not\ninextricably  intertwined  with  the  speech  the  day  labor\nprovisions regulate.  Nothing in those provisions prohibits a\nworker from expressing his views publicly, nor is there any\nreason such views cannot be expressed without soliciting\nwork.  See Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S.\n469, 474 (1989) (“No law of man or of nature makes it\nimpossible  to  sell  housewares  without  teaching  home\neconomics, or to teach home economics without selling\nhousewares.”).\nImmigration policy and economic equality are matters of\npublic importance and the mere presence of day laborers on\nthe street may express something about their own views on\nthese topics.  The presence of day laborers soliciting work in\n575 (1987) (refusing to adopt a limiting construction because “the words\nof the resolution simply leave no room for a narrowing construction”).\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 15 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 15\nthe streets may also increase the salience of economic or\nimmigration  debates  to  others  who  encounter  the  day\nlaborers.  However compelling these arguments, the Supreme\nCourt has made clear that “advertising which ‘links a product\nto a current public debate’ is not thereby entitled to the\nconstitutional protection afforded noncommercial speech.”\nBolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 68 (1983)\n(quoting Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 563 n.5)).  The act of\nsoliciting work as a day laborer may communicate a political\nmessage, but the primary purpose of the communication is to\nadvertise a laborer’s availability for work and to negotiate the\nterms of such work.  The district court correctly concluded\nthat  the  day  laborer  provisions  restrict  only  commercial\nspeech.\nB.  The Day Labor Provisions Are Content-Based\nRestrictions\nThe district court also correctly determined that the day\nlabor provisions are content-based restrictions on commercial\nspeech.    “A  regulation  is  content-based  if  either  the\nunderlying purpose of the regulation is to suppress particular\nideas or if the regulation, by its very terms, singles out\nparticular content for differential treatment.”  Berger v. City\nof Seattle, 569 F.3d 1029, 1051 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)\n(citation omitted).  On their face, the day labor provisions\ntarget one type of speech – day labor solicitation that impedes\ntraffic  –  but  say  nothing  about  other  types  of  roadside\nsolicitation and nonsolicitation speech.  They are therefore\nclassic  examples  of  content-based  restrictions.    Our\nconclusion  is  confirmed  by  the  stated  purpose  of  the\nprovisions, their legislative history and the disproportionate\nsanctions they impose for traffic problems arising from day\nlabor solicitation.  See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 16 of 35\n16 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\n2653, 2663 (2011) (“Just as the ‘inevitable effect of a statute\non its face may render it unconstitutional,’ a statute’s stated\npurposes may also be considered” in determining whether it\nis content-based. (quoting United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S.\n367, 384 (1968))); United States v. Playboy Entm’t Grp., Inc.,\n529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000) (noting that a speech by a bill’s\nsponsor supported the Court’s determination that the bill was\ncontent-based); cf. Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 675 F.3d 1213,\n1224–25 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that differential treatment\nsupports an inference of viewpoint discrimination).\nThe district court reasonably determined that the purpose\nof the day labor provisions was to suppress labor-solicitation\nspeech rather than to promote traffic safety.  Significantly, the\npurposes clause introducing S.B. 1070 describes it as an\nimmigration bill, not a traffic safety bill.  See S.B. 1070, ch.\n113, 2010 Ariz. Sess. Laws § 1 (The “intent of [S.B. 1070] is\nto make attrition through enforcement the public policy of all\nstate and local government agencies in Arizona” and the\n“provisions of this act are intended to work together to\ndiscourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of\naliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in\nthe United States.”).  This clear and unambiguous expression\nof purpose contradicts Arizona’s argument that the day labor\nprovisions are content-neutral traffic regulations.  Rather,\nthey appear expressly intended to deter day labor activity by\nundocumented immigrants.\nThough not dispositive of legislative intent, portions of\nthe legislative history also evince hostility to day laborer\nsolicitation  rather  than  concern  with  traffic  safety.    For\ninstance,  State  Representative  Kavanagh,  the  day  labor\nprovisions’ principal legislative sponsor, stated at committee\nhearings that they would promote traffic safety but that they\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 17 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 17\nwould also discourage the “shadow economy” of day labor\nand address illegal immigration because “[a] large number of\nthese people are illegal immigrants and this is the way they\nget work, and this work is one of the anchors that keeps them\nin the country.”\nFinally, the day labor provisions’ punishment is far out of\nline with punishments for other similar traffic violations.  For\nexample, conduct that recklessly impedes traffic is punishable\nby 30 days’ imprisonment, but day labor solicitation that is\nnot dangerous or reckless, but merely impedes traffic, is a\nclass  1  misdemeanor  punishable  by  up  to  six  months’\nimprisonment.    Compare  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  §  13-2928(F)\n(violation  of  the  day  labor  provisions  is  a  class  1\nmisdemeanor), and § 13-707(A)(1) (class 1 misdemeanor\npunishable by up to six months’ imprisonment), with § 13-\n2906 (recklessly interfering with the passage of any highway\nor public thoroughfare is a class 3 misdemeanor), and § 13-\n707(A)(3) (class 3 misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days’\nimprisonment).  The imposition of a much harsher penalty for\nthose who block traffic while engaging in labor solicitation\nspeech evidences the desire to suppress such speech.\nArizona argues that the day labor provisions are content-\nneutral because they were enacted to ameliorate “secondary\neffects” – the traffic problems created when day laborers\ncongregate and solicit employment from passing vehicles.\nSee City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 48\n(1986) (holding that a zoning regulation on adult theaters was\ncontent-neutral  because  it  had  been  enacted  to  “prevent\ncrime, protect the city’s retail trade, maintain property values,\nand generally [protect] and [preserve] the quality of [the\nCity’s] neighborhoods, commercial districts, and the quality\nof urban life” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Arizona\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 18 of 35\n18 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nraised this argument before the district court, which implicitly\nrejected  it  by  finding  that  the  day  labor  provisions  are\ncontent-based.  This rejection was not an abuse of discretion\nin light of the facts showing that the purpose of the day labor\nprovisions was to suppress labor-solicitation speech.  Cf. id.\n(holding that a content-neutral “‘predominate’ intent[] . . . is\nmore than adequate to establish that the city’s [purpose] . . .\nwas  unrelated  to  the  suppression  of  free  expression.”).\nArizona’s argument that the day labor provisions are content-\nneutral under Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 719–20 (2000),\nbecause they are “justified” by its interest in traffic safety\nsuffers from the same defect.  See ACLU of Nev. v. City of\nLas Vegas, 466 F.3d 784, 793 (9th Cir. 2006) (“‘[T]he mere\nassertion of a content-neutral purpose [is not] enough to save\na law which, on its face, discriminates based on content.’ . . .\n[Instead,] we will hold that [an] ordinance is content-based if\n. . . the main purpose in enacting it was to suppress or exalt\nspeech of a certain content.” (first and second alterations in\noriginal) (emphasis added) (quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.\nv. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642–43 (1994))).\nThe district court correctly concluded that the day labor\nprovisions are content-based restrictions.\nII.\nThe district court also correctly concluded that the day\nlabor provisions are likely unconstitutional restrictions.  We\nevaluate restrictions on commercial speech using the four-\npart test from Central Hudson:\n(1) if the communication is neither misleading\nnor related to unlawful activity, then it merits\nFirst  Amendment  scrutiny  as  a  threshold\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 19 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 19\nmatter; in order for the restriction to withstand\nsuch scrutiny, (2) [t]he State must assert a\nsubstantial  interest  to  be  achieved  by\nrestrictions on commercial speech; (3) the\nrestriction  must  directly  advance  the  state\ninterest involved; and (4) it must not be more\nextensive  than  is  necessary  to  serve  that\ninterest.\nWorld Wide Rush, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, 606 F.3d 676,\n684 (9th Cir. 2010) (alteration in original) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) (quoting Metro Lights, L.L.C. v. City of Los\nAngeles, 551 F.3d 898, 903 (9th Cir. 2009)).  The parties\ndispute whether the day labor provisions satisfy Central\nHudson’s first, third and fourth prongs.  The parties also raise\nthe challenging issue of whether Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2664,\n2667–68, made the fourth Central Hudson prong for content-\nbased  restrictions  on  commercial  speech  even  more\ndemanding for the state.  We conclude that the day labor\nprovisions are deficient under even the pre-Sorrell, arguably\nmore government-friendly, precedent urged by Arizona.  We\nwill  therefore  apply  that  precedent  and  defer  extended\ndiscussion of Sorrell for a more appropriate case with a more\nfully developed factual record.  We turn to each of Central\nHudson’s four prongs in turn.\nA.  Day Laborer Solicitation Is Neither Misleading nor\nRelated to Unlawful Activity\nCommercial speech merits First Amendment protection\nonly if “the communication is neither misleading nor related\nto unlawful activity.”  World Wide Rush, 606 F.3d at 684\n(quoting Metro Lights, 551 F.3d at 903).  Arizona argues that\nthe day labor provisions are permissible because they regulate\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 20 of 35\n20 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nspeech only when associated with the unlawful activity of\nblocking or impeding traffic.  Arizona’s proposed rule would\nbe  a  novel  extension  of  Central  Hudson’s  legality\nrequirement, which has traditionally focused on the content\nof affected speech – i.e., whether the speech proposes an\nillegal  transaction  –  instead  of  whether  the  speech  is\nassociated with unlawful activity.  See Wash. Mercantile\nAss’n  v.  Williams,  733  F.2d  687,  691  (9th  Cir.  1984)\n(rejecting the argument that drug paraphernalia’s association\nwith  illegal  drug  use  allows  the  state  to  restrict  all\nparaphernalia advertising; instead holding that paraphernalia\nadvertising is not protected in states where such sales are\nillegal  but  that  paraphernalia  advertising  warrants  First\nAmendment scrutiny if the advertising proposes a sale in a\nstate where such sales are legal).  Some decisions have\nexpressly phrased the legality requirement as whether “the\ntransactions proposed in the forbidden [communication] are\nthemselves illegal in any way.”  Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy,\n425 U.S. at 772; see also Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary\nCounsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 638 (1985)\n(“The States and the Federal Government are free to prevent\nthe dissemination of commercial speech that . . . proposes an\nillegal transaction . . . .”).  Other decisions have used Central\nHudson’s  more  general  “related  to  unlawful  activity”\nlanguage.  Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564; see also Fla. Bar\nv. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 623–24 (1995) (“Under\nCentral  Hudson,  the  government  may  freely  regulate\ncommercial speech that concerns unlawful activity . . . .”).\nHowever it is formulated, we think it clear that Central\nHudson’s legality requirement requires us to evaluate the\ncontent of a commercial message rather than the means by\nwhich that message is conveyed.  Here, that means that the\nplaintiffs have satisfied the requirement because it is legal to\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 21 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 21\nhire or be hired for day labor.  We find support for this\nconclusion both in Pittsburgh Press, the Supreme Court case\nupon which Arizona principally relies, and in the Supreme\nCourt’s explanation in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S.\n377, 383–84 (1992), of what it means for certain speech to be\n“excluded” from First Amendment protection.\nPittsburgh Press, the case from which Central Hudson\ndrew its legality requirement, considered only the commercial\ntransaction  proposed  by  an  advertisement.    There,  the\nSupreme  Court  held  that  a  newspaper  has  no  First\nAmendment right to publish a discriminatory employment\nadvertisement.  See Pittsburgh Press, 413 U.S. at 388–89.\nThe  Supreme  Court  reasoned  that,  just  as  it  would  be\npermissible  to  ban  an  advertisement  for  narcotics  or\nprostitution, it was permissible to ban gender-specific job\npostings because sex discrimination in hiring is illegal.  See\nid. at 388.  The Court concluded that “[a]ny First Amendment\ninterest which might be served by advertising an ordinary\ncommercial proposal and which might arguably outweigh the\ngovernmental interest supporting the regulation is altogether\nabsent when the commercial activity itself is illegal and the\nrestriction on advertising is incidental to a valid limitation on\neconomic activity.”  Id. at 389.\nIn Pittsburgh Press, unlike here, the affected speech\nproposed an illegal transaction – the discriminatory hiring of\na worker.  The day labor provisions, on the other hand,\nregulate  speech  proposing  a  legal  transaction  where  the\nspeech is conducted in an unlawful manner.  Nothing in\nPittsburgh Press or any other case Arizona cites suggests that\nwe should expand our inquiry beyond whether the affected\nspeech proposes a lawful transaction to whether the affected\nspeech is conducted in a lawful manner.  Moreover, the\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 22 of 35\n22 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nSupreme Court’s discussion in R.A.V. of categorical First\nAmendment exemptions cautions that such an expansion\nwould be improper.\nIn R.A.V., the Supreme Court discussed its approach to\ncategorical exemptions from First Amendment scrutiny.  It\nexplained  that,  although  it  has  sometimes  said  that  the\n“protection of the First Amendment does not extend” to\ncertain categories of speech, that statement is not “literally\ntrue.”    R.A.V.,  505  U.S.  at  383  (quoting  Bose  Corp.  v.\nConsumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 504 (1984)).\nInstead, what a categorical exclusion means is that, “these\nareas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment,\nbe regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable\ncontent.”  Id.  The proposal of an illegal transaction is, like\nthe  obscenity  and  defamation  discussed  in  R.A.V.,\ncategorically exempted from First Amendment protection\nbecause it lacks social value.  See United States v. Williams,\n553  U.S.  285,  297  (2008)  (“Offers  to  engage  in  illegal\ntransactions  are  categorically  excluded  from  First\nAmendment protection.” (citing Pittsburgh Press, 413 U.S.\nat 388)).  The basis of this categorical exclusion is the content\nof  the  speech,  not  the  manner  in  which  that  speech  is\nconducted.  See id. (“[O]ffers to give or receive what it is\nunlawful to possess have no social value and thus, like\nobscenity, enjoy no First Amendment protection.” (citing\nPittsburgh Press, 413 U.S. at 387–89)).  Thus, in deciding\nwhether to apply a categorical exception, we look to the\ncontent of a communication rather than the method of that\ncommunication.  Here, the content of the communication –\nthe solicitation of labor – is perfectly legal.\nThis approach fits with R.A.V.’s ultimate lesson, which is\nthat government may not leverage its power to regulate one\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 23 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 23\nsphere of activity into the ability to favor certain speech\nwithin that sphere.  So, though a state may ban all fighting\nwords, it may not ban only those fighting words that invoke\nrace, color, creed, religion or gender.  See R.A.V., 505 U.S. at\n391–96.  Similarly, the government may prohibit all outdoor\nfires, but it may not specifically prohibit flag burning.  Id. at\n385 (“[B]urning a flag in violation of an ordinance against\noutdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag in\nviolation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.”\n(citing Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 406–07 (1989))).  In\nthe commercial speech context, R.A.V. noted that, though a\nstate may “regulate price advertising in one industry but not\nin others, because the risk of fraud . . . is in its view greater\nthere,” it “may not prohibit only that commercial advertising\nthat depicts men in a demeaning fashion.”  Id. at 388–89\n(citations omitted).\nArizona may prohibit pedestrians and motorists from\nblocking traffic, and it has done so.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-\n2906(A) (imposing criminal penalties for one who “recklessly\ninterferes  with  the  passage  of  any  highway  or  public\nthoroughfare by creating an unreasonable inconvenience or\nhazard”).  But as we discuss below, it may not, consistent\nwith the First Amendment, use a content-based law to target\nindividuals for lighter or harsher punishment because of the\nmessage they convey while they violate an unrelated traffic\nlaw.    Such  disparate  treatment  implicates  the  First\nAmendment.\nIn sum, it is legal in Arizona to hire or be hired for day\nlabor.  The day labor provisions limit the ability of day\nlaborers and employers to solicit, negotiate and consummate\nthat  legally  permissible  transaction.    The  district  court\ntherefore correctly held that the day labor provisions are\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 24 of 35\n24 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nsubject to First Amendment scrutiny as restrictions on lawful,\nnonmisleading speech.\nB.  Arizona Has Satisfied Central Hudson’s Second\nProng by Demonstrating that it Has a Substantial\nInterest in Traffic Safety\nArizona asserts that the day labor provisions are justified\nby the state’s desire to promote traffic safety.4  Promoting\ntraffic safety is undeniably a substantial government interest.\nSee Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490,\n507–08 (1981) (holding that there can be no “substantial\ndoubt that the twin goals that the ordinance seeks to further\n– traffic safety and the appearance of the city – are substantial\ngovernmental  goals”).    Arizona  has  therefore  satisfied\nCentral  Hudson’s  substantial  governmental  interest\nrequirement.\nC.  The District Court’s Determination that the Day\nLabor Provisions Directly Advance Arizona’s Interest\nin Traffic Safety Was Not an Abuse of Discretion\nCentral Hudson’s third prong requires that a restriction on\ncommercial  speech  must  “directly  advance”  the  state’s\nsubstantial interest.  Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564.  One\n“consideration  in  the  direct  advancement  inquiry  is\n‘underinclusivity . . . .’”  Metro Lights, 551 F.3d at 904.\n   4 Arizona identifies several other substantial interests, including crime\nreduction, economic development and protecting the aesthetics of its\ncommunities.  As before the district court, Arizona identifies these\ninterests as substantial but fails to argue that the day labor provisions are\nnarrowly tailored to achieve them.  We therefore decline to address these\nadditional interests.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 25 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 25\n“Central Hudson requires a logical connection between the\ninterest a law limiting commercial speech advances and the\nexceptions a law makes to its own application.”  Id. at 905.\nWe term a law that distinguishes among types of commercial\nspeech without such a logical connection “underinclusive.”\nAs we discuss here, underinclusivity is relevant to Central\nHudson’s direct advancement prong because it “may diminish\nthe credibility of the government’s rationale for restricting\nspeech in the first place.”  Id. at 904–05 (quoting City of\nLadue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 52 (1994)).  As we discuss in\nSection  II.D,  infra,  underinclusivity  is  also  relevant  to\nCentral Hudson’s narrow tailoring prong.\nAbove, we held that the day labor provisions are content-\nbased because they distinguish between day labor solicitation\nspeech and all other types of roadside solicitation.  In Ballen\nv. City of Redmond, 466 F.3d 736 (9th Cir. 2006), we struck\ndown an ordinance that prohibited many commercial signs\nbut exempted real estate signs, because “[t]he City . . . failed\nto  show  how  the  exempted  signs  reduce  vehicular  and\npedestrian safety or besmirch community aesthetics any less\nthan the prohibited signs.”  Id. at 743.  The adoption of a\ncontent-based restriction, absent justification, “indicate[d]\nthat the City ha[d] not carefully calculated the costs and\nbenefits associated with the burden on speech.”  Id.\nThe day labor provisions, however, are not automatically\nunderinclusive simply because they are content-based and fail\nto regulate all forms of roadside communication.  See Metro\nLights, 551 F.3d at 910 (noting that a regulation that bans\nsome, but not all, advertising signs is not automatically\nunderinclusive).    Similarly,  Arizona  may  discriminate\nbetween  different  types  of  roadside  communication  if  it\ndetermines that roadside labor solicitations present more\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 26 of 35\n26 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nacute safety concerns than other roadside communications.\nSee  id.  (holding  that  the  additional  danger  posed  by\n“uncontrolled and incoherent proliferation” of offsite signs\nwas sufficient justification for treating uncontrolled offsite\nadvertising differently from regulated advertising at transit\nstops).    Finally,  Arizona  may  consider  the  benefits  of\ndifferent types of roadside communications when determining\nwhich  communications  to  restrict.    See  id.  at  910–11\n(respecting city’s decision that the value it derives from one\nform of advertising, but not another, “is stronger than the\ncity’s  interests  in  traffic  safety  and  esthetics.”  (quoting\nMetromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 512\n(1981))).\nArizona does not argue that day labor solicitation is less\nvaluable than other types of roadside solicitation.  The inquiry\nis therefore whether anything in the record supports Arizona’s\nassertion that day labor solicitation creates more acute traffic\nsafety concerns than other types of roadside communication.\nThe plaintiffs say no, arguing that jaywalking, protesting,\nselling food or goods at the side of the road and a number of\nother activities present the same traffic concerns as day labor\nsolicitation but are unregulated by the day labor provisions.\nArizona counters that the plaintiffs’ assertion is the one\nunsupported by the record, which includes news articles,\ndeclarations and photographs of day laborers and vehicles\nblocking traffic.  We take the point that day labor solicitation\nmay  create  traffic  safety  concerns.    This  evidence  is\nnonprobative, however, on the key question of whether those\nconcerns are more acute than the traffic safety concerns\ncaused by other types of roadside communication.\nArizona introduced declarations from two former police\nofficers explaining the particular traffic problems caused by\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 27 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 27\nday laborer solicitation.  Most of the officers’ declarations\ndiscuss  the  hazards  of  roadside  pedestrian-motorist\ncommunications  generally;  while  they  would  support\npenalizing pedestrian-motorist interactions generally, they do\nnot support singling out day labor solicitation.  One officer\ndid, however, represent that day laborer interactions require\nthe parties to negotiate multiple terms, and so take longer\nthan  other  types  of  in-street  solicitation.    Whether  this\nstatement is admissible, accurate or generally applicable is far\nfrom clear, but at this stage of the proceedings we must\naccept  it  as  an  asserted  fact  that  might  justify  harsher\nsanctions than for other roadside speech that blocks traffic.\nThe district court applied the correct legal standard and\ndetermined  that  the  day  labor  provisions,  while\n“underinclusive to some degree,” still ban enough traffic-\nblocking solicitation that they directly advance Arizona’s\ninterest in traffic safety.  Although the evidence was weak,\nthe court’s conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.\nD.  There Is a Substantial Likelihood that Plaintiffs Will\nSucceed on Their Claim that the Day Labor Provisions\nRestrict More Speech than Necessary to Serve\nArizona’s Interest in Traffic Safety\nFinally, Central Hudson requires that a regulation “is not\nmore extensive than is necessary to serve” a substantial\ngovernment interest.  447 U.S. at 566.  The test is sometimes\nphrased  as  requiring  a  “‘reasonable  fit’  between\n[government’s] legitimate interests” and the means it uses to\nserve those interests, City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network,\nInc., 507 U.S. 410, 416 (1993), or  that the government\nemploy a “means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired\nobjective,” Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 28 of 35\n28 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\n469,  480  (1989).    The  district  court  concluded  that  the\nplaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on their\nclaim that the day labor provisions are not “drawn to achieve”\nArizona’s substantial interest in traffic safety.  The court\nderived this standard from Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., 131\nS. Ct. 2653, 2667–68 (2011), which held that “[t]o sustain [a]\ntargeted, content-based burden . . . on protected expression,\nthe State must show at least that . . . the measure is drawn to\nachieve  that  interest.”    The  parties  debate  whether  this\nstandard is more stringent than Central Hudson’s formulation\nthat  a  restriction  must  be  no  “more  extensive  than  is\nnecessary to serve that interest.”  Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at\n566.  At the least, Sorrell articulates the test the Supreme\nCourt most recently applied to a content-based restriction on\ncommercial  speech,  so  the  district  court  did  not  err  in\napplying  it.    Whether  Sorrell  intended  to  make  the\ncommercial speech test more exacting for the state to meet is\na question that we need not decide, because we conclude\nplaintiffs are likely to succeed even under Central Hudson’s\nformulation of the standard and our cases interpreting it.\nUnder those decisions, a restriction on commercial speech\n“must not be more extensive than is necessary to serve” a\nsubstantial  government  interest  –  i.e.,  it  should  not  be\noverinclusive.  World Wide Rush, LLC v. City of Los Angeles,\n606 F.3d 676, 684 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Metro Lights,\n551 F.3d at 903) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We\nrecently evaluated a similar in-street solicitation ban and held\nit  to  be  impermissibly  overinclusive.    See  Comite  de\nJornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach\n(Redondo Beach), 657 F.3d 936, 950 (9th Cir. 2011) (en\nbanc).  Redondo Beach applied the “time, place or manner”\ntest for content-neutral restrictions on core First Amendment\nspeech.  Id. at 945.  Like Central Hudson’s for restrictions on\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 29 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 29\ncommercial speech, that test requires that a regulation be\nnarrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.\nSee id. at 948 (“To satisfy the [time, place or manner] narrow\ntailoring requirement, ‘the Government . . . bears the burden\nof showing that the remedy it has adopted does not burden\nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further the\ngovernment’s legitimate interests.’” (quoting Turner Broad.\nSys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 665 (1994))).  Because the\ntest for commercial speech is “‘substantially similar’ to the\napplication of the test for validity of time, place, and manner\nrestrictions,” Redondo Beach provides a helpful framework\nfor analyzing this case.  Fox, 492 U.S. at 477 (quoting S.F.\nArts & Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522,\n537 n.16 (1987)).\nIn Redondo Beach, as here, the government sought to\njustify an in-street solicitation ban by its interest in traffic\nflow and safety.  Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d at 947.  The ban\napplied to all in-street solicitation, regardless of whether the\nsolicitation  blocked  traffic.    See  id.  at  941–42.    We\nrecognized, as we do here, that traffic safety is an important\ngovernment  interest  and  that  solicitation  may  create\ndangerous  traffic  conditions.    See  id.  at  947–48.\nNevertheless,  we  held  that  Redondo  Beach’s  law  was\noverinclusive  because  it  restricted  more  speech  than\nnecessary to serve Redondo Beach’s interest in traffic safety.\nSee id. at 947–51.\nArizona’s law is less restrictive than Redondo Beach’s\nbecause  the  day  labor  provisions  regulate  only  labor\nsolicitation that blocks traffic, whereas Redondo Beach’s\nordinance regulated all roadside solicitation.  Nevertheless,\none line of analysis from Redondo Beach is highly relevant\nand persuasive.  The Redondo Beach ordinance restricted\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 30 of 35\n30 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nmore speech than necessary because “[t]he City has various\nother laws at its disposal that would allow it to achieve its\nstated interests while burdening little or no speech.”  Id. at\n949.  That holding was based on the longstanding rule that,\nbecause restricting speech should be the government’s tool of\nlast  resort,  the  availability  of  obvious  less-restrictive\nalternatives renders a speech restriction overinclusive.  See id.\nat 950 (citing Discovery Network, 507 U.S. at 417 n.13 (“[I]f\nthere are numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives\nto the restriction on commercial speech, that is certainly a\nrelevant  consideration  in  determining  whether  the  ‘fit’\nbetween  ends  and  means  is  reasonable.”);  Village  of\nSchaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 444 U.S. 620, 637\n(1980) (“The Village’s legitimate interest in preventing fraud\ncan be better served by measures less intrusive than a direct\nprohibition on solicitation.  Fraudulent misrepresentations can\nbe prohibited and the penal laws used to punish such conduct\ndirectly.”); Schneider v. New Jersey, 308 U.S. 147, 162\n(1939) (“There are obvious methods of preventing littering.\nAmongst these is the punishment of those who actually throw\npapers on the streets.”)).\nPlaintiffs have cited a number of preexisting Arizona laws\nthat  could  be  used  to  address  legitimate  traffic  safety\nconcerns without burdening speech.  These include Arizona\nRevised  Statutes  Sections  28-873(A)  (civil  penalties  for\nstopping or parking a car in various situations),  28-905 (civil\npenalties for opening a car door if it interferes with traffic),\nand 13-2906(A) (criminal penalties for one who “recklessly\ninterferes  with  the  passage  of  any  highway  or  public\nthoroughfare by creating an unreasonable inconvenience or\nhazard.”).  Arizona responds that “the existing traffic laws\nhad  insufficient  or  no  deterrent  effect  on  in-street\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 31 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 31\nemployment solicitation.”  This argument misses the point\nand is in any event unsupported.\nFirst, Arizona’s substantial government interest is  in\ntraffic flow and safety, not in curbing in-street employment\nsolicitation.  The question is therefore not whether existing\nlaws  are  sufficient  to  deal  with  in-street  employment\nsolicitation, but rather whether existing laws are sufficient to\ndeal  with  the  traffic  problems  that  may  attend  in-street\nemployment solicitation.  Arizona, which bears the burden of\nproof on this issue, has introduced no evidence addressing it.\nSecond, our consideration is not limited to Arizona’s\nactual traffic safety regulations, but includes any potential or\nactual traffic safety regulations that are obviously available.\nSee, e.g., Discovery Network, 507 U.S. at 417 (“The fact that\nthe city failed to address its recently developed concern about\nnewsracks by regulating their size, shape, appearance, or\nnumber  indicates  that”  the  restriction  was  not  narrowly\ntailored).  As discussed above,  Redondo Beach identified a\nnumber of existing laws the city could have invoked that were\nbroad enough to address the traffic concerns attending in-\nstreet employment solicitation without implicating speech.\nSee Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d at 949–50 (citing California\nordinances  prohibiting  jaywalking,  stopping  in  traffic\nalongside a red-painted curb, stopping a car “so as to obstruct\nthe normal movement of traffic,” standing in a roadway “if\nsuch action interferes with the lawful movement of traffic”\nand standing or stopping “except as near as is physically\npossible  to  the  building  line  or  the  curb  line”).    Our\ndiscussion in Redondo Beach highlights the animating First\nAmendment  principle  that  government  must  consider\npursuing  its  interests  through  conduct-based  regulations\nbefore enacting speech-based regulations.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 32 of 35\n32 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nNothing in the record shows that Arizona could not\neffectively pursue its interest in traffic safety by enforcing or\nenacting  similar  kinds  of  speech-neutral  traffic  safety\nregulations.    Therefore,  even  under  the  Central  Hudson\nstandard Arizona urges, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the\nmerits  of  their  claim  that  the  day  labor  provisions  are\noverinclusive  because  they  restrict  more  speech  than\nnecessary to serve Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.5\nThe day labor provisions are a poor fit with Arizona’s\ninterest in traffic safety because, in this context, they are also\nunderinclusive.  As we previously discussed, the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in concluding that the day labor\nprovisions are underinclusive but not so much so that they fail\nto directly advance Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.  That\nthe day labor provisions are underinclusive is still relevant,\nhowever, to whether they satisfy Central Hudson’s no-more-\nextensive-than-necessary prong.  The district court correctly\nnoted the relevance of underinclusivity to this inquiry and\ncorrectly determined that the provisions’ underinclusivity\ncontributes to the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the\nmerits.  See Metro Lights, 551 F.3d at 905 n.8 (explaining\nthat underinclusivity is relevant to both whether a speech\nrestriction directly advances the government’s interest and\nwhether it is more extensive than necessary).\nA statute that “discriminat[es] on the basis of content”\nmay be “‘more extensive than necessary’ to advance the\ngovernment’s interest” if there is no valid reason for the\n   5 We reiterate that we consider only the limited record before us and\nonly as a predictive matter at the preliminary injunction stage.  Nothing in\nour opinion should be read as foreclosing the parties from introducing\nadditional evidence as this case proceeds.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 33 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 33\ndiscrimination.  Id. (quoting Cent. Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566)\n(citing Ballen, 466 F.3d at 743–44).  In Ballen, we held that,\nwhere there is no reason related to the government’s asserted\ninterest for distinguishing based on content, a content-based\nlaw restricts more speech than necessary because it indicates\nthat the government “has not carefully calculated the costs\nand benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by\nits discriminatory, content-based prohibition.”  466 F.3d at\n743.\nThe day labor provisions are content-based restrictions\ndesigned to suppress the economic activity of undocumented\nimmigrants.  Unlike in Ballen, Arizona has proffered at least\nsome legitimate basis for distinguishing between day labor\nsolicitation and other roadside communications.  See Section\nII.C, supra.  As noted, however, that justification is only\nmarginally supported by the record.  In its narrow tailoring\nanalysis,  the  district  court  correctly  discounted  it  and\nemphasized S.B. 1070’s purposes clause, the fact that the day\nlabor  provisions  provide  penalties  drastically  out-of-\nproportion  to  those  for  other  traffic  violations  and  the\nlegislative record.  These factors all support the court’s\nconclusion that the day labor provisions are underinclusive\nbecause they are “structured to target particular speech rather\nthan a broader traffic problem.”  That conclusion, whether\nunder  Central  Hudson  or  Sorrell,  undercuts  Arizona’s\nargument that the day labor provisions are narrowly tailored\nto serve its interest in traffic safety.\nIn sum, Arizona could have advanced its interest in traffic\nsafety directly, without reference to speech.  The availability\nof such obvious and less-restrictive alternatives makes the\nday  labor  provisions  overinclusive.    They  are  also\nunderinclusive because they draw content-based distinctions\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 34 of 35\n34 VALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING\nthat appear motivated by a desire to eliminate the livelihoods\nof undocumented immigrants rather than to address Arizona’s\ninterest  in  traffic  safety.    Being  both  overinclusive  and\nunderinclusive, the day labor provisions restrict more speech\nthan necessary to serve Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.\nThe district court correctly determined that plaintiffs are\nlikely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment\nclaim.\nIII.\nIn addition to likelihood of success on the merits, a court\ngranting a preliminary injunction must consider the likelihood\nof irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, the\nbalance of equities and the public interest.  See Winter v.\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The\ndistrict court considered each of these factors.  Its conclusion\nthat plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of\nan injunction was appropriate because “[t]he loss of First\nAmendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,\nunquestionably  constitutes  irreparable  injury.”    Elrod  v.\nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).  The court correctly found\nthat the equities tip in favor of the plaintiffs because they\nhave a significant First Amendment and economic interest in\nengaging in solicitation speech and Arizona need not impede\nthat speech in order to pursue its traffic safety goals.  Finally,\nthe court correctly found that an injunction is in the public\ninterest because the day labor provisions, if enforced, would\ninfringe the First Amendment rights of many persons who are\nnot parties to this lawsuit.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 802-1   Filed 03/27/13   Page 35 of 35\nVALLE DEL SOL V. WHITING 35\nCONCLUSION\nLaws that limit commercial speech must not be more\nextensive than necessary to serve a substantial government\ninterest.  The district court correctly determined that, though\nArizona has a significant government interest in promoting\ntraffic safety, the day labor provisions fail Central Hudson’s\nrequirement that restrictions on commercial speech be no\nmore extensive than necessary to serve that interest.  The\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\nthe plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits and that the\nother requirements for a preliminary injunction are satisfied.\nWe  therefore  affirm  the  preliminary  injunction  barring\nenforcement of the day labor provisions.\nAFFIRMED",

BACKGROUND\n24 The Arizona Legislature enacted a set of statutes and statutory am endments in the\n25 form of Senate Bill 1070, the “Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,”\n26 2010 Arizona Session Laws, Chapter 113, which Governor Brewer signed into law on April\n27 23, 2010. Seven days later, the Governor signed into law a set of amendments to Senate Bill\n28\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 2 of 38\n1 1070 in the form of House Bill 2162, 2010 Arizona Session Laws, Chapter 211.1 S.B. 1070\n2 had an effective date of July 29, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the Court entered a  preliminary\n3 injunction in the related case United States v. Arizona, CV 10-1413-PHX-SRB. (See United\n4 States v. Arizona, CV 10-1413-PHX-SRB, Doc. 87, Orde r Granting Prelim. Inj. (“USA\n5 Order”).) In the USA Order, the Court preliminarily enjoined certain provisions of S.B. 1070.\n6 (Id. at 4.)\n7 Plaintiffs challenge S.B. 1070 in its entirety.2 (Compl. ¶ 183, Prayer for Relief ¶ b.)\n8 Plaintiffs also raise specific challenges to Sections 2, 3, 5, and 6 of S.B. 1070. (Compl. ¶¶\n9 180-218.) Section 2 of S.B. 1070 adds Arizona Revised Statute (“A.R.S.”) § 11-1051, which\n10 requires law enforcement officials to check a person’s im migration status under certain\n11 circumstances. Plaintiff principally contests the constitutionality of Subsection 2(B) of S.B.\n12 1070, which requires officers to make a reasonable attempt, when practicable, to determine\n13 an individual’s immigration status during any lawful stop, detention, or arrest where\n14 reasonable suspicion exists that the person is unlawfully present in the United States. A.R.S.\n15 § 11-1051(B). Subsection 2(B) also provides that all persons who are arrestedu mst have their\n16 immigration status verified prior to release. Id. \n17 Section 3 of S.B. 1070 adds A.R.S. § 13-1509, which provides that “a person is guilty\n18\n1 In this Order, unless otherwise specified, the Court refers to Senate Bill 1070 and\n19\nHouse Bill 2162 collectively as “S.B. 1070,” describing the  April 23, 2010, enactment as\n20 modified by the April 30, 2010, amendments.\n21 2  As noted in the USA Order, the Court cannot “decla re  an entire statute\nunconstitutional  if the constitutional portions can be severed from   those which are\n22\nunconstitutional.” State v. Ramsey, 831 P.2d 408, 413 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1992) (citing State v.\n23 Prentiss,  786 P.2d 932, 937 (Ariz. 1989)). In determ ining  whether potentially\nunconstitutional  provisions of S.B. 1070 m ay  be severed from   the rem ainder  of  the\n24\nenactment, the primary concern is legislative intent. See id. at 715-16 (citing City of Mesa\nv. Killingsworth, 394 P.2d 410, 413 (Ariz. 1964)). Section 12(A) of S.B. 1070 demonstrates\n25\nthat the Arizona Legislature intended the provisions of the enactment to be severable in order\n26 to preserve the constitutional provisions of the Act. S.B. 1070, § 12(A). The Court will not\nignore S.B. 1070’s severability clause or the obligation to preserve the constitutional\n27\nprovisions of a state legislative enactment. The Court thus evaluates the constitutionality of\n28 the individual provisions of S.B. 1070 challenged by Plaintiffs.\n- 2 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 3 of 38\n1 of willful failure to com plete or carry an alien registration docum ent if the person is in\n2 violation of [8 U.S.C. §§] 1304(e) or 1306(a),” federal statutes that require aliens to carry\n3 documentation of registration and penalize the willful failure to register. Id. § 13-1509(A).\n4 Section 5 of S.B. 1070 adds two provisionst o the Arizona Criminal Code, A.R.S. §§\n5 13-2928 and 13-2929. A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) makes it unlawful for an occupant of a motor\n6 vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic to attempt to\n7 hire a person for work at another location. Similarly, A.R.S. § 13-2928(B) provides that it\n8 is unlawful for a person to enter a motor vehicle in order to be hired if the vehicle is stopped\n9 on a street, roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic. A.R.S. § 13-2928(C) provides that\n10 it is unlawful “for a person who is unlawfully  present in the United States and who is an\n11 unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform\n12 work as an employee or independent contractor in this state.” A.R.S. § 13-2929 m akes it\n13 unlawful for a person, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien is unlawfully\n14 present in the United States, who is in viola tion of a criminal offense to: (1) transport or\n15 move or attempt to transport or move the alien in Arizona in furtherance of the alien’s\n16 unlawful presence in the United States; (2) conceal, harbor, or shield or attempt to conceal,\n17 harbor, or shield the alien from detection in Arizona; or (3) encourage or induce the alien to\n18 come to or live in Arizona.  Id. § 13-2929(A)(1)-(3). \n19 Finally, Section 6 of S.B. 1070 amends A.R.S. § 13-3883 to permit an officer to arrest\n20 a person without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe that “the person to be\n21 arrested has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United\n22 States.” Id. § 13-3883(A)(5).\n23 Plaintiffs filed the instant suit as a class action on May 17, 2010, asserting six causes\n24 of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations  of the following provisions of the United\n25 States Constitution: (Count 1) the Supremacy Clause; (Count 2) the Equal Protection Clause;\n26 (Count 3) the First Am endment; (Count 4) the Fourth Am endment; (Count 6)  the Due\n27 Process Clause; and (Count 7) the Right to Travel under the Privilege s and Immunities\n28 Clause. (Compl. ¶¶ 198, 204-214.) Plaintiffs also claim that S.B. 1070 violates Article II, §\n- 3 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 4 of 38\n1 8 of the Arizona Constitution (Count 5) and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count 8).

Defendants Babeu and Walsh, Defendan tArpaio, and Intervenor Defendant Brewer\n3 now move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Proc edure\n4 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing and have failed to state a claim\n5 upon which relief may be granted.3\n6 II.

(Pinal Cnty. Defs.’ MTD at\n12 4-6; Arpaio MTD at 2-5; Brewer MTD at 4-12.) “Article III of the Constitution limits the\n13 judicial power of the United States to the resolution of [c] ases and [c]ontroversies, and\n14 Article III standing . . . enforces the Constitution’s case-or-controversy requirement.” Hein\n15 v. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 597-98 (2007) (internal quotations and\n16 citations omitted). An analysis of standing requires an examination of “whether the particular\n17 plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.” Allen v. Wright, 468\n18 U.S. 737, 752 (1984). “‘[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to\n19 press’ and ‘for each form of relief’ that is sought.” Davis v. F.E.C., 128 S. Ct. 2759, 2769\n20 (2008) (quoting DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006)); see also Oregon\n21 v. Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F.3d 965, 969 (9th Cir. 2009). Where claim s are raised by one\n22 plaintiff who has standing, the court need not determine whether other plaintiffs asserting the\n23\n24\n3 Defendants Babeu, Walsh and Arpaio also argue that Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe\nfor adjudication. (Pinal Cnty. Defs.’ MTD at 6-7; Arpaio MTD at 5-7.) In addition,\n25\nDefendant Arpaio asserts that designation of the suit as a class action is inappropria te.\n26 (Arpaio MTD at 9-10.) Defendants Babeu and Walsh also assert that Plaintiffs have failed\nto plead a short and plain statem ent of the claim  as required by Federal Rule of Civil\n27\nProcedure 8 and that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring claim s against Babeu and Walsh\n28 specifically. (Pinal Cnty. Defs.’ MTD at 3-6.)\n- 4 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 5 of 38\n1 same claims also have standing.S  ee, e.g., Watt v. Energy Action Educ .Found., 454 U.S. 151,\n2 160 (1981); Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 607 F.3d\n3 1178, 1183 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Bates v. UPS, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007)\n4 (“In  a class action, standing is satisfied if at least one na med  plaintiff m eets  the\n5 requirements.”).4\n6 In evaluating standing, courts must accept all material allegations in the complaint as\n7 true and construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff. Graham v. FEMA, 149 F.3d 997,\n8 1001 (9th Cir. 1998) (citingW  arth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975)). The plaintiff has the\n9 burden of establishing standing and must “‘allege[] such a personal stake in the outcome of\n10 the controversy’ as to warrant [the] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and . . . justify\n11 exercise of the court’s remedial powers.” Warth, 422 U.S. at 498-99 (quoting Baker v. Carr,\n12 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)).\n13 In order to have standing pursuant to Article III, a plaintiff must show (1) an “injury\n14 in fact” that is concrete and particularized and actual or immine nt (not conjectural or\n15 hypothetical); (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action otfh e defendant;\n16 and (3) that it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by\n17 a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); see also\n18 Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1149 (2009). Even when the constitutional\n19\n4 The Court notes that ther e is some authority suggesting that this lim itation on\n20\nstanding analysis applies only to appellate review. See Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc.\n21 v. Wasden, 376 F.3d 908, 918 n.6 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that “on remand, when the district\ncourt enters the appropriate injunctive relief against enforcement of the statute, it may need\n22\nto decide whether Planned Parenthood is a proper plaintiff . . . [becaus e[o]]nly a proper party\n23 to an action can enforce an injunction that results from a final judgment”); see also Town of\nSouthold v. Town of E. Hampton, 406 F. Supp. 2d 227, 235 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. 2005). However,\n24\nappellate courts generally have the same obligation to address standing as the trial courts, and\nseveral district courts have applied this limited standing analysis at the trial court level. See\n25\nSierra Club v. El Paso Props., Inc,. No. 01-cv-02163-BNB-MEH, 2007 WL 45985, at *3 (D.\n26 Colo. Jan. 5, 2007) (collecting cases). At this satge in this putative class action, the standing\ninquiry is required to establish this Court’s jurisdic tion. The Court has jurisdiction to\n27\nconsider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims if at least one Plaintiff has standing to bring each\n28 claim.\n- 5 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 6 of 38\n1 minima of standing are present, prudential concerns may impose additional limitations. Elk\n2 Grove  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  11-12  (2004).  Prudential  standing\n3 limitations embody “‘judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction’”\n4 and include “‘the general prohibition on a litigant’s raising another person’s legal rights, the\n5 rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the\n6 representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff’s complaint fall within the zone\n7 of interests protected by the law invoked.’” Id. at 12 (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 750-51); see\n8 also Alaska Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Feldma,n 504 F.3d 840, 848-49 (9th Cir.\n9 2007).\n10 An organization has standing “to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to\n11 vindicate whatever rights and immunities the association itself may enjoy.” Warth, 422 U.S.\n12 at 511. “An organization may establish a sufficient injury in fact if . . . a challenged statute\n13 or policy frustrates the organization’s goals and requires the organization ‘to expend\n14 resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways.’” Redondo\n15 Beach, 607 F.3d at 1183 (quoting El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Exec. Office of Immigration\n16 Review, 959 F.2d 742, 748 (9th Cir. 1992)); see also Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\n17 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). Where a statute “perceptibly impair[s]” an organization’s ability to\n18 provide the services the organization was formed to provide, “there can be no question that\n19 the organization has suffered [an] injury in fact. Such concrete and demonstrable injury to\n20 the  organization’s activities–with the consequent drain on the organization’s\n21 resources–constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social\n22 interests.” Havens, 455 U.S. at 379. An organization also has “associational standing” to\n23 bring suit on behalf of itsm  embers “when its members would otherwise have standing to sue\n24 in their own right, the interests at stake are germ ane to the organization’s purpose, and\n25 neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual\n26 members in the lawsuit.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528\n27 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (citing Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343\n28 (1977)).\n- 6 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 7 of 38\n1 Plaintiffs assert various injuries arising from the future operation and enforcement of\n2 S.B. 1070. (Compl. ¶¶ 7-30.) “A plaintiff who  challenges a statute m ust demonstrate a\n3 realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s ope ration or\n4 enforcement.” Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union , 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)\n5 (citation omitted). However, “[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened\n6 injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly im pending that is enough.” Id.\n7 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Similarly, “‘it is not necessary that [a plaintiff ]first\n8 expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge [a criminal] statute\n9 that he claims deters the exercise  of his constitutional rights.’”  Id. (quoting Steffel v.\n10 Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 (1974)). In order to have standing to challenge a crim inal\n11 statute prior to the statute’s enforcement, a plaintiff must allege “an intention to engage in\n12 a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a\n13 statute,” and that a “credible threat” of prosecution existsI.d .; see also San Diego Gun Rights\n14 Comm. v. Reno, 98 F.3d 1121, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 1996).\n15 a.  Injury in Fact \n16 Plaintiffs must have standing to bring each claim asserted. See Davis, 128 S. Ct. at\n17 2769 (citing DaimlerChrysler, 547 U.S. at 352). In order to have standing to bring a\n18 particular claim, Plaintiffs must allege an injury in fact arising from the challenged conduct.\n19 See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 (1996) (noting that “standing is not dispensed in\n20 gross” and that “‘a plaintiff who has been usbject to injurious conduct of one kind [does not]\n21 possess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating conduct of another kind,\n22 although similar, to which he has not been subject’” (quotingB lum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991,\n23 999 (1982)). The Court evaluates the alleged injuries as they relate to the asserted claims.\n24 i. Civil Rights Violations (Counts 2, 4-6, 8)\n25 Plaintiffs assert various claims for violations of their civil rights arising from  the\n26 enforcement and operation of S.B. 1070 as written. Several organizations allege injuries on\n27 their  own behalf, asserting that S.B. 1070 will im pair  their ability to pursue their\n28 organizational missions. (Compl. ¶¶ 7-20 (alleging injuries to the organizational missions of\n- 7 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 8 of 38\n1 Plaintiffs  Friendly House, Service   Employees International Union (“SEIU”), Service\n2 Employees International Union Local 5 (“SEIU Arizona”), United Food and Com mercial\n3 Workers  International Union (“UF CW”),  Arizona S outh  Asians for S afe  Families\n4 (“ASAFSF”), Southside Presbyterian Church (“Southside”), Arizona Hispanic Chamber of\n5 Commerce (“AZHCC”), Asian Chamber of Commerce (“ACC”), Border Action Network\n6 (“BAN”), Tonatierra Community Development Institute (“Tonatierra”), Muslim American\n7 Society (“MAS”), Japanese Am erican Citizens League (“JACL”), Valle del Sol, and\n8 Coalicion de Derechos Humanos (“Derechos Humanos”)).) Governor Brewer argues that the\n9 organizational Plaintiffs have not “ alleged facts sufficient to establish that [S.B. 1070]\n10 adversely impacts their mission, nor have they diverted resources in a manner that establishes\n11 a ‘concrete and demonstrable injury.’” (Brewer MTD at 10 (quoting  Havens, 455 U.S. at\n12 379).)\n13 Plaintiffs  allege that several of the organizational Plaintiffs’ m issions  involve\n14 promoting and protecting immigrant and minority rights, preventing discrimination, and\n15 educating and providing assistance to immigrant or minority populations. (See, e.g., Compl.\n16 ¶ 7 (asserting that Plaintiff Friendly House is a non-profit organization tha t provides\n17 immigration services, including assistance with asylum applications); id. ¶ 20 (stating that\n18 Plaintiff Derechos Humanos’s mission is to promote human rights in the U.S.-Mexico border\n19 region); id. ¶¶ 12, 16 (asserting that Plaintiffs Southside and Tonatierra operate day laborer\n20 centers).) Plaintiffs assert that S.B. 1070 will frustrate the m issions of the organizational\n21 Plaintiffs in several ways. \n22 First, Plaintiffs allege that several Plaintiff organizations will have to divert resources,\n23 or already have diverted resources, in order to educate and assist com munity members\n24 affected by S.B. 1070 and address the efar and confusion created by S.B. 1070. S(ee, e.g., id.\n25 ¶¶ 12, 14, 17-19;i d. ¶ 20 (alleging that Plaintiff “Derechos Humanos has already been forced\n26 to suspend most of its work relating to community education . . . to respond to inquiries from\n27 the community about S.B. 1070”).) Plaintiffs also allege that S.B. 1070 will create fear and\n28 confusion, harming several of the organizational Plaintiffs’ missions by deterring clients and\n- 8 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 9 of 38\n1 members from participating in the organizations’ programs out of fear of being stopped under\n2 S.B. 1070. (Id. ¶¶ 7-11, 13, 17-20.) In addition, the organizational Plaintiffs assert that the\n3 potential for criminal prosecutions will deter participation by members and frustrate their\n4 organizational purpose. (Id. ¶ 11 (alleging tha t Plaintiff ASAFSF’s volunteers face an\n5 imminent risk of prosecution and that this risk harms ASAFSF’s mission); id. ¶ 12 (alleging\n6 that Southside employees and volunteers would be at risk of prosecution while performing\n7 their work in furtherance of Southside’s mission); id. ¶ 15 (alleging that, as a result of the\n8 risk of criminal prosecutions, Plaintiff BAN will have to divert resources to educate emmbers\n9 about their rights and responsibilities under the law and address fear s and concerns).)\n10 Plaintiffs also allege that S.B. 1070 will frustrate the organizational purpose of day laborer\n11 centers by criminalizing the expressive activity of members who are not authorized to work\n12 and chilling the expressive activity of m embers who are authorized to work. (Id. ¶ 16.)\n13 Finally, Plaintiffs allege that S.B. 1070 will deter business, cause economic harm within the\n14 state, and make it more difficult for some organizations to retain members as a result of\n15 members leaving the state. (Id. ¶¶ 13-15.) \n16 The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that S.B. 1070 “perceptibly impair[s]”\n17 the ability of the organizational Plaintiffs to provide the services that the organizations were\n18 formed to provide, and, as a result, “there can be no question that the organization[s] ha[ve]\n19 suffered [an] injury in fact.” See Havens, 455 U.S. at 379. While Governor Brewer correctly\n20 points out that, for the most part, the organizational Plaintiffs’ allegations involve threats of\n21 future harm, the threat of future harm is sufficiently imminent. See Babbitt, 442 U.S. at 298\n22 (“A plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a\n23 direct injury as a result of the statute’s operation or enforcement . . . . [and] does not have to\n24 await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is\n25 certainly impending that is enough.” (internal quotation and citation omitted)).\n26 The harms alleged by the organizational Plaintiffs do not result from any hypothetical\n27 unlawful enforcement or application of S.B. 1070. The alleged harm to the organizational\n28 Plaintiffs will occur if S.B. 1070 goes into effect, regardless of how it is enforced or applied.\n- 9 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 10 of 38\n1 The organizations allege that they will have to divert resources to educate and assist\n2 members, staff, and clients faced with the purportedly unconstitutional S.B. 1070. (Compl.\n3 ¶¶ 12, 14, 17-20.) Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that S.B. 1070 will deter clients and members\n4 from participating in the organizational Plaintiffs’ programs. (See id. ¶¶ 7-11, 13, 17-20.) In\n5 order to continue providing services to their clientele, these organizations would presuambly\n6 have to divert resources to reach the same individuals. (See id. ¶¶ 12, 14, 17-19.) In addition,\n7 Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Derechos Humanos “has already been forced to suspend most\n8 of its work relating to community education on border deaths and leadership development\n9 to respond to inquiries from the community about S.B. 1070.” (Id. ¶ 20.) The organizational\n10 Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the civil rights violations they claim will result from\n11 S.B. 1070 will require, or have already required, them  to divert resources and that the\n12 violations will injure their organizational missions. Plaintiffs have alleged a sufficient injury\n13 in fact for purposes of standing to raise their civil rights claims (Counts 2, 4-6, 8).\n14 ii. First Amendment (Count 3)\n15 Plaintiffs’ allegations of injury to their First Amendment rights include two distinct\n16 injuries. First, Plaintiff Tonatierra alleges that it operates a day laborer center and that S.B.\n17 1070’s provisions prohibiting the solicitation of em ployment frustrate its m ission “to\n18 empower workers and protect them  from exploitation” by preventing day laborers from\n19 expressing their ability to work. (Id. ¶ 16.) Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to support an\n20 injury in fact. Where an organization’s mission is to assist and protect clients in performing\n21 a  specific activity, the organization’s m ission  is “perceptibly im paired”  by a statute\n22 criminalizing or chilling the clients’ activity.S ee Havens, 455 U.S. at 379;s ee also Redondo\n23 Beach, 607 F.3d at 1183 (finding an organization whose m ission was to strengthen and\n24 expand the work of day laborers had standing to challenge an ordinance preventing the\n25 solicitation of work). Here, Tonatierra alleges that its m ission is to protect and assist day\n26 laborers and that S.B. 1070’s regulation of employment solicitation frustrates this mission.\n27 Plaintiff Tonatierra has alleged a sufficient injury in fact resulting from  an alleged First\n28 Amendment violation. See Redondo Beach, 607 F.3d at 1183.\n- 10 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 11 of 38\n1 Second, the Complaint also alleges that individual Plaintiffs and m embers of the\n2 organizational Plaintiffs are afraid to speak a foreign language or accented English around\n3 law enforcement officers and that this fear results in a chilling of their Fir st Amendment\n4 rights. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 8-9, 13, 22, 23.) These allegations are not sufficiently imminent for\n5 purposes of standing. In the First Amendment context, self-censorship is “a harm that can be\n6 realized even without an actual prosecution.”  Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Ass’n, 484 U.S.\n7 383, 393 (1988). However, “[t]he potential plaintiff must have ‘an actual and well-founded\n8 fear that the law will be enforced against [him or her]’ [and] such a fear of prosecution will\n9 only inure if the plaintiff’s intended speech arguably falls within the statute’s reach.” Cal.\n10 Pro-Life Council, Inc. v. Getman , 328 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting  Am.\n11 Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 393). In addition, “[a] llegations of a subjective ‘chill’ are not an\n12 adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future\n13 harm.” Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972). Here, S.B. 1070 does not purport to limit\n14 the rights of individuals to speak. Plaintiffs’ allegations are of only a “subjective chill” and\n15 do not give rise to an injury in fact resulting from a First Amendment violation for standing\n16 purposes. \n17 iii. Right to Travel (Count 7)\n18 Individual Plaintiffs Vicki Gaubeca and Jesus Cuauhtemoc Villa also allege that, as\n19 residents of New Mexico possessing only New Mexico driver’s licenses, they face an\n20 imminent threat of detention pursuant to S.B. 1070 because their driver’s licenses do not\n21 dispel reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence. (Compl. ¶¶ 22, 27.) Subsection 2(B) of\n22 S.B. 1070 provides for a presumption of lawful presence where an individual can provide\n23 identification from any state or local government that “requires proof of legal presence in the\n24 United States before issuance.” A.R.S. § 11-1051(B). Plaintiffs allege that New Mexico does\n25 not require such proof prior to issuing identification. However, Plaintiffs Gaubeca and\n26 Cuauhtemoc Villa do not allege that they will be deterred from traveling to or in Arizona.\n27 (See Compl. ¶¶ 22, 27.) Rather, both Plaintiffs allege only that they believe or fear that they\n28 could be detained after being pulled over “because [their] New Mexico driver’s license will\n- 11 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 12 of 38\n1 not be accepted to dispel suspicion that [they are ]‘unlawfully present’ in the United States.”\n2 (Id. ¶ 22; see also id. ¶ 27.) An injury in fact cannot be based on a “chain of speculative\n3 contingencies.” Lee v. Oregon, 107 F.3d 1382, 1388 (1997). In order for the alleged injury\n4 to arise, Plaintiffs would have to be  lawfully stopped by a law enforcem ent officer, the\n5 officer would then have to develop reasonable  suspicion that Plaintiffs were unlawfully\n6 present in the United States, and then the stop would have to result in an unlawful detention.\n7 This hypothetical chain of events is too speculative to support an injury in fact for purposes\n8 of standing on a claim for violations of the right to travel. Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) Motions\n9 to Dismiss are granted as to Plaintiffs’ right to travel claim (Count 7). \n10 b. Causation\n11 The alleged injury in fact must also be fairly traceable to the challenged actionL. ujan,\n12 504 U.S. at 560. Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries arise from the impact that Sections 2, 3, 5 and 6,\n13 have on the Plaintiffs. (See Compl. ¶¶ 7-30.) Defendants do not argue that the alleged injuries\n14 are not fairly traceable to the provisions of S.B. 1070. Plaintiffs’ Com plaint contains\n15 adequate allegations making the alleged injuries fairly traceable to the enactm ent and\n16 enforcement of S.B. 1070.\n17 c. Redressability\n18 Finally, Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries would likely be redressed by a favorable decision.\n19 See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. Relief preventing the enforcement of S.B. 1070 or declaring S.B.\n20 1070 unconstitutional would alleviate the organizational Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.\n21 d. Prudential Standing Considerations\n22 Prudential standing limitations prevent courts from looking at generalized grievances,\n23 claims brought on behalf of third-parties, and claims that do not fall within the zone of\n24 interests protected by the law invoked. Newdow, 542 U.S. at 12. Governor Brewer argues\n25 that Plaintiffs “allege general concern about [S.B. 1070]  rather than a specific, concrete\n26 injury” and that the Court should “refrain ‘from  adjudicating abstract questions of wide\n27 public significance which amount to generalized grievances, pervasively shared and most\n28 appropriately addressed in the representative branches.” (Brewer MTD at 11 (quotinVga  lley\n- 12 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 13 of 38\n1 Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc,. 454 U.S. 464,\n2 475 (1982) (internal quotations and citations omitted)).) The organizational Plaintiffs allege\n3 injuries specific to their organizational missions. (See Compl. ¶¶ 7-20.) The alleged injuries\n4 are not “pervasively shared” by the public. See Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 475. In addition,\n5 the alleged injuries giving rise to standing are injuries suffered by the organizational\n6 Plaintiffs. The claims are not impermissibly asserted on behalf of third-parties.5\n7 2. Ripeness\n8 Defendants Babeu, Walsh, and Arpaio also argue that Plaintiffs’ Complaint is not ripe\n9 for adjudication. (Pinal Cnty. Defs.’ MTD at 6-7; Arpaio MTD at 5-7.) Ripeness has both\n10 constitutional and prudential components. Portman v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898,\n11 902 (9th Cir. 1993). “The constitutional component of ripeness overlaps with the ‘injury in\n12 fact’ analysis for Article III standing . . . [and] [w]hether framed as an issue of standing or\n13 ripeness, the inquiry is largely the sam e: whether the issues presented are ‘definite and\n14 concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.’” Wolfson v. Brammer, No. 09-15298, 2010 WL\n15 3191159, at *7 (9th Cir. Aug. 13, 2010) (quoting  Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights\n16 Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000));  see also Getman, 328 F.3d at 1093-94\n17 (noting that in many cases, the analysis of ripeness and standing are the same). Analysis of\n18 the prudential component weighs “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the\n19 hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.”  Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387\n20 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967), overruled on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99,\n21\n22\n5 Defendants Babeu and Walsh also argue “the [C]omplaint alleges no facts specific\n23 to either Pinal County Sheriff Babeu or Pinal County Attorney Walsh to establish that any\nof the . . . [P]laintiffs have met the standing requirements.” (Pinal Cnty. Defs.’ MTD at 5.)\n24\nOfficials with a direct role in the enforcement of challenged provisions are proper defendants\nin a suit challenging the validity of a legislative enactment. Wasden, 376 F.3d at 919-20. As\n25\nthe Pinal County Sheriff and County Attorney, Defendants Babeu and Walsh will be tasked\n26 with enforcing S.B. 1070. Plaintiffs here seek an injunction prohibiting this enforceemnt, and\nit is appropriate to seek such an injunction against officials with a direct role in enforceemnt.\n27\nSee id. The organizational Plaintiffs’ allegations of injury are sufficie nt to sustain claims\n28 against officials tasked with enforcing S.B. 1070.\n- 13 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 14 of 38\n1 105 (1977).\n2 Here, the Court has already de termined that Plaintiffs have alleged definite and\n3 concrete injuries. Plaintiffs have also satisfied the prudential com ponent of ripeness. “A\n4 claim is fit for decision if the issues raised are primarily legal, do not require further factual\n5 development, and the challenged action is final.”S tandard Alaska Prod. Co. v. Schaible, 874\n6 F.2d 624, 627 (9th Cir. 1989). Plaintiffs assert that S.B. 1070 is unconstitutional on its face;\n7 the  issues ra ised  are  primarily  legal and do not require further factual developm ent.\n8 Moreover, “[t]o meet the hardship requirement, a litigant must show that withholding review\n9 would result in direct and immediate hardship and would entail more than possible financial\n10 loss.” Winter v. Cal. Med. Review, Inc. , 900 F.2d 1322, 1325 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal\n11 quotation and citation omitted). The organizational Plaintiffs allege that they will be subject\n12 to an organizational injury as a result of the enforcement of an unconstitutional enactment\n13 if S.B. 1070 goes into effect. ( See Compl. ¶¶ 7-11, 13, 17-20.) These are sufficient\n14 allegations of hardship for the purposes of ripeness.\n15 B. Motions to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n16 1. Standard for Dismissal\n17 Plaintiffs assert causes of action for violations of: (1) the Supremacy Clause;6 (2) the\n18 Equal Protection Clause; (3) the First Amendment; (4) the Fourth Amendment; (5) Article\n19 II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution; (6) the Due Process Clause; (7) the Right to Travel; and\n20 (8) 42 U.S.C. § 1981. (Compl. ¶¶ 180-218.) Defendants Brewer, Arpaio, Babeu and Walsh\n21 (“Defendants”) move to dismiss all eight causes of action, asserting that Plaintiffs have failed\n22 to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The Court addresses each of Plaintiffs’ clasim\n23 in turn.\n24 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require “only ‘a short and plain statement of the\n25 claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’ in order to ‘give the defendant fair notice\n26\n27\n6 The Court does not address Plaintiffs’ claim alleging a violation of the supremacy\n28 clause as the Court already thoroughly addressed this issue in the USA Order.\n- 14 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 15 of 38\n1 of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n2 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)); see also Fed.\n3 R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Thus, dismissal for insufficiency of a complaint is proper if the complaint\n4 fails to state a claim on its face. Lucas v. Bechtel Corp., 633 F.2d 757, 759 (9th Cir. 1980).\n5 “While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not need detailed factual\n6 allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’\n7 requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a\n8 cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted). A Rule 12(b)(6)\n9 dismissal for failure to state a claim can be based on either: (1) the lack of a cognizable legal\n10 theory; or (2) insufficient facts to support a cognizable legal claim . Balistreri v. Pacifica\n11 Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990); Robertson v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,\n12 749 F.2d 530, 534 (9th Cir. 1984).\n13 In determining whether an asserted claim can be sustained, all allegations of material\n14 fact are taken as true and construed in the light m ost favorable to the non-moving party.\n15 Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network , 18 F.3d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1994). This presum ption\n16 applies only to facts and “is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”A  shcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\n17 1937, 1949 (2009). “[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge\n18 that actual proof of those facts is im probable, and that ‘re covery is very rem ote and\n19 unlikely.’” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (quotingS cheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)).\n20 However, “for a com plaint to survive a m otion to dismiss, the non-conclusory ‘factual\n21 content,’ and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim\n22 entitling the plaintiff to relief.” Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009)\n23 (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1952). In other words, the com plaint must contain enough\n24 factual content “to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence” of the\n25 claim. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556.\n26 2.  Equal Protection Clause and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Counts 2 and 8)\n27 Plaintiffs allege that S.B. 1070 violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause\n28 (Count 2) and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count 8). (Compl. ¶¶ 185-90, 215-18.) Plaintiffs assert that\n- 15 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 16 of 38\n1 S.B. 1070 “was enacted with th e purpose and intent to discrim inate against racial and\n2 national origin minorities, including Latinos, on the basis of race and national origin.” (Id.\n3 ¶ 187.) Plaintiffs also allege that S.B. 1070 “impermissibly and invidiously targets Plaintiffs\n4 who are racial and national origin m inorities . . . and subjects them  to stops, detentions,\n5 questioning, and arrests because of their race and/or national origin,” and that Section 3 of\n6 S.B. 1070 “impermissibly discriminates against non-citizen Plaintiffs on the basis of alienage\n7 and deprives them of the equal protection of the laws.” I(d. ¶ 190.) Plaintiffs similarly allege\n8 that S.B. 1070 “impermissibly discriminates against persons within the State of Arizona on\n9 the basis of alienage and national origin and race” in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. (Id. ¶\n10 218.)\n11  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “commands that no State\n12 shall deny to any person . . . the equal protectiono f the laws, which is essentially a direction\n13 that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\n14 Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (internal quotation and c itation omitted).\n15 Similarly, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 prohibits discrimination under color of state law based on race,\n16 “ancestry[,] or ethnic characteristics.” Saint Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613\n17 (1987); see also Manatt v. Bank of Am., NA, 339 F.3d 792, 798 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that\n18 “when  Congress enacted § 1981, it intended ‘race’ to be defined broadly, to cover\n19 discrimination against ethnic groups” (citing  Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. at 613)). Where a\n20 plaintiff alleges that facially neutral legislation is unconstitutional in violation of the Equal\n21 Protection Clause and also that he or she is entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the\n22 claims are “indistinguishable . . . and the analysis is the same . . . . [because] [u]nder either\n23 theory, the [plaintiff] must prove [he or she is]  deprived of equal protection of the laws,\n24 which requires a showing of discriminatory intent.” Hispanic Taco Vendors of Wash. v. City\n25 of Pasco, 994 F.2d 676, 679 n.3 (9th Cir. 1993). The Court addresses the sufficiency of\n26 Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause and § 1981 claims together.\n27 Generally,  “legislation is presum ed  to be valid a nd  will be sustained if the\n28 classification drawn by the statute is r ationally related to a legitim ate state interest.”\n- 16 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 17 of 38\n1 Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440; see also United States v. Flores-Villar, 536 F.3d 990, 997 (9th\n2 Cir. 2008). However, under the Equal Protection Clause, certain classifications, including\n3 classifications based on race, alienage, and national origin, are subject to strict scrutiny and\n4 will be sustained only if  they are suitably tailored to serve a com pelling state interest.\n5 Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440. Classifications that appear neutral but are a pretext for racial\n6 discrimination are also subject to strict scrutiny. Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442\n7 U.S. 256, 272 (1979) (noting that strict scrutiny applies to “a classification that is ostensibly\n8 neutral but is an obvious pretext for racial discrimination” (citing Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118\n9 U.S. 356 (1886); Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347 (1915)); see also Valeria v. Davis,\n10 307 F.3d 1036, 1039 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that “governmental actions . . . that are facially\n11 neutral but motivated by discriminatory racial purpose . . . are subject to strict scrutiny”).\n12 “Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands\n13 a  sensitive inquiry into such c ircumstantial  and direct evidence of intent as m ay  be\n14 available.” Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp. , 429 U.S. 252, 266\n15 (1977); see also Hispanic Taco Vendors, 994 F.2d at 679-80.\n16 Here, Plaintiffs assert that “racial discrimination was a motivating factor for [S.B.]\n17 1070’s enactment.” (Pls.’ Resp. to Mots. to Dismiss (“Pls.’ Resp.”) at 37; Compl. ¶ 187.) In\n18 addition, Plaintiffs assert that Section 3 of S.B. 1070 explicitly discriminates on the basis of\n19 alienage. (Compl. ¶ 190; Pls.’ Resp. at 38-39.) Plaintiffs allege that it is “widely understood\n20 that [S.B. 1070] is motivated by . . . discrimination against Latinos and other racial minorities\n21 in Arizona on the basis of their race and national origin.” (Compl. ¶ 73.) Plaintiffs also allege\n22 that Arizona State Senators made statements indicating that S.B. 1070 was likely to result in\n23 increased discrimination and racial profiling.7 (See Compl. ¶¶ 68-69.) Similarly, Plaintiffs\n24 allege that the sponsor of S.B. 1070 has a hisotry of making racially insensitive remarks and\n25 sponsoring legislation in Arizona related to race and national origin. I(d. ¶¶ 70-71.) Finally,\n26\n7 “[W]hen the adverse consequences of a  law upon an identifiable group are . . .\n27\ninevitable . . . a strong inference that the adverse effects were desired can reasonably be\n28 drawn.” Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 n.25.\n- 17 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 18 of 38\n1 Plaintiffs also allege that, on its face, S.B. 1070 targets and discriminates against minorities.\n2 (Id. ¶¶ 188, 190, 218.) The Complaint contains adequate allegations that race, alienage, or\n3 national origin discrimination was a motivating factor in the enactment of S.B. 1070.8 Race,\n4 alienage and national origin are so rarely relevant to the achievement of a legitimate state\n5 interest that laws grounded in such considerations are subject to strict scrutinCy.l eburne, 473\n6 U.S. at 440. For the purposes of a c hallenge under Rule 12(b)(6), the Complaint contains\n7 “non-conclusory ‘factual content,’” from which the Court can draw “reasonable inferences\n8 . . . [that are] plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief.” Moss, 572 F.3d\n9 at 969 (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1952). Governor Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’\n10 Equal Protection and § 1981 claims is denied.\n11 3. The First Amendment (Count 3)\n12 Plaintiffs challenge three provisions of S.B. 1070 on First Aemndment grounds (Count\n13 3), asserting that S.B. 1070 infringes on Plaintiffs’ freedom  of speech by restricting\n14 employment solicitation speech and chilling the first am endment rights of non-English\n15 speakers and individuals who speak English with an accent. (Com pl. ¶¶ 84-85, 109, 159,\n16 192-93.) First, Plaintiffs assert that A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B), which prohibit the act of\n17 hiring and being hired by the occupant of a motor vehicle, infringes on day laborers’ First\n18 Amendment right to free speech. (Id. ¶¶ 16, 101-06, 193.) Plaintiffs also challenge A.R.S.\n19 § 13-2928(C), which makes it “unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present in the United\n20 States and who is an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public\n21 place or perform work as an employee or independent contractor in this state.” (Id. ¶¶ 101-\n22 09, 193 (citing A.R.S. § 13-2928(C)).) Finally, Plaintiffs assert that Section 2 of S.B. 1070\n23 infringes on the First Amendment rights of non-English speakers. (Id. ¶¶ 8-9, 13, 22-23, 83-\n24 87, 159.) \n25 The First Amendment guarantees that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the\n26\n8 While S.B. 1070 also contains provisions porhibiting the consideration of race, color,\n27\nand national origin, A.R.S. § 11-1051(B), these provisions, standing alone, are not sufficient\n28 to insulate against Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause and § 1981 claims.  \n- 18 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 19 of 38\n1 freedom  of speech.” U.S .  Const. am end.  I.9  However, “the governm ent  may  impose\n2 reasonable restrictions on the tim e, place, or m anner of protected speech, provided the\n3 restrictions ‘are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, . . . are\n4 narrowly tailored to serve a significant governm ental interest, and . . .  leave open am ple\n5 alternative channels for communication of the information.’” Redondo Beach, 607 F.3d at\n6 1184 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989)). \n7 a. Section 5: A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B)\n8 Section 5 of S.B. 1070 makes it unlawful for “an occupant of a motor vehicle that is\n9 stopped on a street, roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic to attempt to hire a person\n10 for work at another location” and for “a person to enter a motor vehicle in order to be hired\n11 if the vehicle is stopped on a street, roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic.” A.R.S.\n12 §13-2928(A), (B). Plaintiffs assert that “Section 5 of S.B. 1070 creates a content-based\n13 regulation of protected speech” by prohibitinga nd regulating speech soliciting work. (Compl.\n14 ¶¶ 102-03.) \n15 Solicitation is a “form of expression that consists of both expressive content and\n16 associated conduct or acts.” Redondo Beach, 607 F.3d at 1184. “[R]estrictions on acts of\n17 solicitation  that were passed to support legitim ate  government  concerns unrelated to\n18 suppressing any particular message are content neutral.” Id. at 1185 (citing ACLU of Nev. v.\n19 City of Las Vegas, 466 F.3d 784, 794 & n.10 (9th Cir. 2006); Berger v. City of Seattle, 569\n20 F.3d 1029, 1051 (9th Cir. 2009)). However, “[a ]restriction aimed at conduct does not satisfy\n21 this content neutrality test . . . when the restriction ‘by its very terms, singles out particular\n22 content for differential treatment.’” Id. at 1186 (quoting Berger, 569 F.3d at 1051). \n23 In Redondo Beach, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appea ls found that an ordinance\n24 making it “unlawful for any person to stand on a street or highway and solicit, or attempt to\n25 solicit, employment, business, or contributions from an occupant of any motor vehicle” was\n26\n27\n9 “The Fourteenth Amendment makes this limitation applicable to the states.” City of\n28 Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 45 n.1 (1994).\n- 19 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 20 of 38\n1 a valid, content neutral regulation of speech. 607 F.3d at 1184-93. ThRe edondo Beach court\n2 found that the ordinance at issue was “aimed at acts of on-the-spot solicitation” and regulated\n3 “broad categories of expression which [did not] require an officer to make . . . a substantive\n4 evaluation  of a speaker’s m essage.”  Id.  at 1188. A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) are\n5 considerably narrower than the Redondo Beach ordinance. Unlike the Redondo Beach\n6 ordinance, S.B. 1070 regulates only solicitation related to employment rather than a broad\n7 category of solicitation. See A.R.S. § 13-2928(A), (B). Importantly, S.B. 1070’s provisions\n8 are directed only at employment solicitation and not more broadly at the act of solicitation.\n9 See ACLU of Nev., 466 F.3d at 794 (noting that “[al]though courts have held that bans on the\n10 act of solicitation are content-neutral, we have not found any case holding that a regulation\n11 that separates out words of solicitation for differential treatment is content-neutral” (citation\n12 omitted)). \n13 A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) are content-based regulations of speech because the\n14 provisions “differentiate[] based on the content of speech,” prohibiting only the solicitation\n15 of employment. See id. at 793-94 (finding that an ordinance prohibiting handbills requesting\n16 financial or other assistance but permitting handbills with other content was a “content-based\n17 distinction because it single[d] out certain speech for differential treatment based on the idea\n18 expressed” (internal quotation and citation om itted)); see also Berger, 569 F.3d at 1051\n19 (finding that an ordinance that prohibited street performers from soliciting donations but did\n20 not prohibit the perform ers from communicating other messages was a content-based\n21 regulation of speech). As a content-based regulation, A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) is only\n22 valid if it “serves a compelling government interest in the least restrictive manner possible.”\n23 Berger, 569 F.3d at 1053. Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated their clai mof a First Amendment\n24 violation. Therefore, the Motions to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge to A.R.S.\n25 § 13-2928(A) and (B) are denied.\n26 b. Section 5: A.R.S. § 13-2928(C)\n27   Section 5 of S.B. 1070 also adds A.R.S. § 13-2928(C), which makes it unlawful for\n28 “a person who is unlawfully present in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien\n- 20 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 21 of 38\n1 to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform work as an employee\n2 or independent contractor in this state.” Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for violations of the\n3 First  Amendment  based  on A.R.S. § 13-2928(C). The Suprem e  Court has held that\n4 individuals who were not authorized to work did not have a right to backpay.  Hoffman\n5 Plastic Compounds v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137, 151 (2002) (noting that “allowing . . . [an a]ward\n6 of backpay to illegal aliens would unduly trench upon explicit statutory prohibitions critical\n7 to federal immigration policy”). Likewise, individuals who are unlawfully present in the\n8 United States and unauthorized to work do not have a right to solicit workC. f. id. Plaintiffs’\n9 First Amendment challenge to A.R.S. § 13-2928(C) is dismissed.\n10 c. Section 2 of S.B. 1070\n11 Section 2 of S.B. 1070 requires law enforcem ent officers to m ake a reasonable\n12 attempt, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of a person where the officer\n13 has lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested the individual and the officer has reasonable\n14 suspicion that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States. A.R.S §\n15 11-1051(B). As discussed above, Plaintiffs lack standing to assert that Section 2 will chill the\n16 speech of individuals who do not speak English or who speak English with an accent. See\n17 Laird, 408 U.S. at 13-14.\n18 4.  The Due Process Clause (Count 6)\n19 Governor Brewer moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ due process claim, Count Six of the\n20 Complaint. (Brewer MTD at 24-28.) Plaintiffsa llege that Section 2 of S.B. 1070 violates the\n21 Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of procedural due process. (Compl. ¶ 206 (alleging that\n22 Section 2 “permits state and local law enforcement officials to seize, detain, and transfer\n23 individuals without appropriate procedures, thereby depriving Plaintiffs of their liberty\n24 without due process of law”).). Plaintiffs further allege that Sections 2, 5, and 6 of S.B. 1070\n25 are void for vagueness and point in particular to eight terms or phrases that they claim are\n26 impermissibly vague. (See id. ¶¶ 206-08.)\n27 a. Procedural Due Process\n28 “The  Fourteenth Am endment’s  Due Process Clause protects persons against\n- 21 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 22 of 38\n1 deprivations of life, liberty, or property; and those who seek to invoke its procedural\n2 protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.W” ilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S.\n3 209, 221 (2005). Subsection 2(B) of S.B. 1070 directs police officers to make a reasonable\n4 attempt to determine the immigration status of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained,\n5 or arrested when the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person might be in the U.S.\n6 unlawfully. A.R.S. § 11-1051(B). Subsection 2(B) also states, “Any person who is arrested\n7 shall have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is released.”  Id.\n8 Section 6 of S.B. 1070 permits a police officer to make a warrantless arrest if the officer has\n9 probable cause to believe that “the person to be arrested has committed any public offense\n10 that makes the person removable from the United States.” Id. § 13-3883(A)(5). Although\n11 Governor Brewer states, “even assuming Plaintiffs can establish a liberty interest,” she does\n12 not make any arguments regarding the nonexistence of a liberty interest. (Brewer MTD at\n13 24.) Arrest and detention are classic exam ples of liberty interests protected by the Due\n14 Process clause. See, e.g., Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 529 (2004) (observing that the\n15 plaintiff’s interest was “the most elemental of liberty interests–the interest in being free from\n16 physical detention by one’s own government” (citations omitted)).\n17 Once it is established that a liberty interest is at stake, the Court turns to the question\n18 of what process is due to people affecte d by S.B. 1070. The Suprem e Court has held,\n19 “Because the requirements of due process are ‘flexible and cal[l]  for such procedural\n20 protections as the particular situation demands,’ we generally have declined to establish rigid\n21 rules and instead have em braced a framework to evaluate the sufficiency of particular\n22 procedures.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224 (quoting Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481\n23 (1972)). The factors to be considered were set out inM athews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335\n24 (1976):\n25 First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action;\nsecond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the\n26 procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of  additional or\nsubstitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest,\n27 including  the function involved and the fiscal and adm inistrative\nburdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would\n28 entail.\n- 22 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 23 of 38\n1\nRegarding the first and third factors, Plaintiffs’ liberty interests here are “weighty,”\n2\nas is Arizona’s interest in promoting the safety and welfare of its citizens.  See Landon v.\n3\nPlasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982). Plaintiffs focus primarily on the second factor, the risk\n4\nof an erroneous deprivation, arguing that because a person’s immigration status cannot be\n5\neasily observed or inferred, S.B. 1070 “invites racial profiling and compels law enforcement\n6\nofficers to make subjective and arbitrary decisions as to whom to single-out for immigration-\n7\nrelated investigation based solely on appearance, race, ethnicity, language, accent, or national\n8\norigin.” (Pls.’ Resp. at 32.) \n9\nPlaintiffs have stated a claim that Subsection 2(B) of S.B. 1070 violates their right to\n10\nprocedural due process on its face. S.B. 1070 contains no meaningful procedural safeguards\n11\nagainst erroneous deprivations of liberty, and im migration status is not something that is\n12\neasily ascertainable. A person who is lawfullyp resent in the U.S. may look and act the same\n13\nway as a person who does not have permission to be in the country, and Plaintiffs’ allegations\n14\nof “subjective and arbitrary” detention decisions by law enforcement agents are plausible.\n15\nFor the purposes of a challenge under Rule 12()b(6), the Complaint contains “non-conclusory\n16\n‘factual content,’” from which the Court can  draw “reasonable inferences . . . [that are]\n17\nplausibly suggestive of a claim  entitling the plaintiff to relief.”  Moss, 572 F.3d at 969\n18\n(quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1952). Governor Brewer’s  Motion is denied as to Plaintiffs’\n19\nprocedural due process claim.\n20\nb. Vagueness\n21\nGovernor Brewer also challenges Plaintiffs’ allegation that Sections 2, 5, and 6 of S.B.\n22\n1070 contain unconstitutionally vague terms. (Brewer MTD at 25-28.) “It is a basic principle\n23\nof due process that an enactm ent is void for va gueness if its prohibitions are not clearly\n24\ndefined.” Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). There are two ways in\n25\nwhich a law may be invalidated on account of vagueness: “First, it may fail to provide the\n26\nkind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits;\n27\nsecond, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” City\n28\n- 23 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 24 of 38\n1 of Chi. v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999) (citing Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357\n2 (1983)). Plaintiffs assert that S.B. 1070 contains terms “that are ‘so vague and standardless\n3 that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits.’” (Pls.’ Resp. at 33 (quoting\n4 City of Chi., 527 U.S. at 56).) The Court analyzes the challenged terms in turn.\n5 i. Section 2\n6 Plaintiffs allege that four terms in Section 2 are impermissibly vague: “reasonable\n7 suspicion,” “reasonable attempt,” “unlawful presence,” and “determ ine the immigration\n8 status.” (Compl. ¶ 206.) “Reasonable suspicion” has long been understood to mean “‘a\n9 particularized and objective basis’ for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity.”\n10 Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996) (quoting United States v. Cortez, 449\n11 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981)). The concept of reasonable suspicion is “fluid” and takes its\n12 “substantive content from the particular context[]” in which it is applied. Id. (citing Illinois\n13 v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 232 (1983)). Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts suggesting that\n14 reasonable suspicion in S.B. 1070 is not properly interpreted as having this long-standing\n15 meaning. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim as to this term. The Court\n16 also finds that “reasonable attempt” is sufficiently clear as used in S.B. 1070. While the\n17 language is not precise, it is not arcane, and it permits an appropriate degree of flexibility in\n18 implementation and does not prevent “ordinary people [from] understand[ing] what conduct\n19 it prohibits.” City of Chi., 527 U.S. at 56 (citing Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357). \n20 With regard to “unlawful presence,” Plaintiffs argue that S.B. 1070 uses the term\n21 inconsistently with its definition under federal law. (Pls.’ Resp. at 33-34). Under the\n22 Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), “an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present in\n23 the United States if the alien is present in the United States after the expiration of the period\n24 of stay authorized by the Attorney General or is present in the United States without being\n25 admitted or paroled.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii). The INA also sets out various exceptions\n26 to time that is included in calculating a period of unlawful presence for purposes of\n27 inadmissibility analysis. See id. § 1182(a)(9)(B)-(C). S.B. 1070 does not purport to deterimne\n28 the length of time a person is properly considered to have been unlawfully present, but\n- 24 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 25 of 38\n1 merely that for some period, they were or are present in the U.S. without perm ission.\n2 Although S.B. 1070 does not contain several of the exceptions contained in the INA, this,\n3 alone, does not render the use of the phrase “unlawful presence” vague. Plaintiffs have not\n4 stated a claim that “unlawful presence,” as used in Section 2, is impermissibly vague.\n5 Plaintiffs also assert that “determine the immigration status” is vague. (Compl. ¶\n6 206.) S.B. 1070 provides that a person’s “immigration status may be determined by: (1) A\n7 law enforcement officer who is authorized by the federal government to ascertain an alien’s\n8 immigration status [or] (2) [t]he United States [I]mmigration and [C]ustoms [E]nforcement\n9 or [t]he United States [C]ustoms and [B]order [P]rotection pursuant to 8 [U.S.C. § ]1373(c).”\n10 A.R.S. § 11-1051(E). Section 1373(c) of Title 8 provides that federal authorities “shall\n11 respond to an inquiry by a Federal, State, or local government agency, seeking to verify or\n12 ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the\n13 agency for any purpose authorized by law, by providing the requested verification or status\n14 information.”  S.B. 1070 does not use the phrase “determ ine  the immigration  status”\n15 inconsistently with federal law because it states that the determ ination is to be made by a\n16 federal agency or federally-authorized law enforcement officer. A.R.S. § 11-1051(E). The\n17 Court concludes that “determine the immigration status” is not vague. Governor Brewer’s\n18 Motion is granted as to Section 2.\n19 ii. Section 5\n20 Plaintiffs allege that two term s in Section 5 are vague: “in furtherance of illegal\n21 presence” and “that the immigrant has entered or remained in the United States illegally.”\n22 (Compl. ¶ 208.) With regard to “in furtherance of illegal presence,” the Court finds that\n23 this phrase is not so vague as to violate the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth\n24 Amendment. The Court gives the words their ordinary meaning, Perrin v. United States, 444\n25 U.S. 37, 42 (1979) (citation om itted), and observes that a parallel provision of federal\n26 immigration law also uses the phrase “in furtherance” of illegal entry or presence in\n27 discussing criminal penalties for similar actions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii).\n28 The Court further concludes that P laintiffs have not stated a claim  that the phrase\n- 25 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 26 of 38\n1 “that the alien has come to, has entered or remains in the United States illegally”  is\n2 unconstitutionally vague. Giving the words their ordinary m eaning, this phrase is not so\n3 unclear as to not give a person of ordinary intelligence knowledge of what conduct is\n4 prohibited. Section 5 makes various actions unlawful if done by a person who knows or\n5 recklessly disregards the fact that a person “ha scome to, has entered or remains in the United\n6 States illegally.” A.R.S. § 13-2929(A). This phrase is not vague. Like “in furtherance of\n7 illegal presence,” a phrase very similar to the one in question appears in federal immigration\n8 law. See 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii)-(iii) (providing criminal penalties for any person who,\n9 “knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains\n10 in the United States in violation of law,” transports, moves, conceals, harbors, or shields the\n11 alien). Governor Brewer’s Motion is granted as to Section 5.\n12 iii. Section 6\n13 Plaintiffs challenge two term s in Section 6: “public offense” and “rem ovable.”\n14 (Compl. ¶ 207.) In full, Section 6 of S.B. 1070a mends A.R.S. § 13-3883 to permit an officer\n15 to arrest a person without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to belie ve that “the\n16 person to be arrested has committed any public offense that makes the person removable\n17 from the United States.” A.R.S. § 13-3883(A)(5). \n18 “Public offense” is defined in Arizona state law as follows:\n19 [C]onduct for which a sentence to a term  of imprisonment or of a fine is\nprovided by any law of the state in which it occurred or by any law, regulation\n20 or ordinance of a political subdivision of that state and, if the act occurred in\na state other than this state, it would be so punishable under the  laws,\n21 regulations or ordinances of this state or of a political subdivision of this state\nif the act had occurred in this state.\n22\nId. § 13-105(26). While Plaintiffs claim  that this phrase, on its own, is vague, their real\n23\nargument has to do with the way it is used in conjunction with the next phrase: “that makes\n24\nthe person removable from the United States.” Id. § 13-3883(A)(5); (see also Pls.’ Resp. at\n25\n34-35.) Plaintiffs argue that “there is no list o sftate crimes ‘that make[] [a] person removable\n26\nfrom the United States.’” (Pls.’ Resp. at 34 (first alteration added).) Plaintiffs also argue that\n27\n“whether a state offense makes a person ‘removable’ requires a complex factual and legal\n28\n- 26 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 27 of 38\n1 analysis.” (Id.) Governor Brewer asserts that both terms have definitions in federal law and\n2 are intended to be applied with those meanings. (Brewer MTD at 27.)\n3 The Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim that Section 6 is void for vagueness.\n4 Because A.R.S. § 13-3883 already provides for the warrantless arrest of a person who\n5 commits a felony, misdemeanor, petty offense, or one of certain crim inal violations in\n6 connection with a traffic accident, the effect of Section 6 on warrantless arrest authority is\n7 somewhat opaque. Whatever the goal of Section 6 was, the Court concludes that its emaning\n8 is not clear from  the statutory language . Crucially, there is no logical m eaning for the\n9 provision that avoids the problem pointed out by Plaintiffs, namely that an officer making\n10 the decision to effect a warrantless arrest is unable to determ ine whether a public offense\n11 makes a person removable from the United States. \n12 Justice Alito has commented that\n13 providing advice on whether a conviction for a particular offense will make an\nalien removable is often quite complex.  “Most crimes affecting immigration\n14 status are not specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and Nationality Act\n(INA)], but instead fall under a broad category of c rimes such as  crimes\n15 involving moral turpitude or aggravated felonies.”  M. Garcia & L. Eig, CRS\nReport for Congress, Immigration Consequences of Criminal Activity (Sept.\n16 20,  2006) (sum mary)  (emphasis  in original).  As has been widely\nacknowledged, determining whether a particular crim e is an “aggravated\n17 felony” or a “crime involving moral turpitude [(CIMT)]” is not an easy task.\n \n18 Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 1488 (2010) (Alito,  J., concurring) (some citations\n19 omitted).  Within the complicated scheme of determining removability, some federal officials\n20 are, under certain circumstances, authorized to change the immigration consequences of the\n21 commission of a public offense and cancel or suspend the removal of an alien.  See, e.g., 8\n22 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a), 1253(a)(3). Ultimately, immigration court judges and federal appeals\n23 court judges determine whether an alien’s offense m akes an alien rem ovable. See id. §\n24 1182(a)(2) (describing crimes that qualify as grounds for inadmissibility); id. § 1227(a)(2)\n25 (describing crimes that qualify as grounds for deportation).\n26 Plaintiffs have stated a claim that Section 6 is void for vagueness because they have\n27 alleged facts sufficient to show that this provision “fail[s] to provide the kind of notice that\n28 will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits.” City of Chi., 527 U.S.\n- 27 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 28 of 38\n1 at 56 (citing Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357). Even a person with extensive experience in law\n2 enforcement and a background in immigration law might not be able to determine easily\n3 whether a public offense m akes a person rem ovable from the United States. Governor\n4 Brewer’s Motion is denied as to Section 6.\n5 5. The  Fourth Amendment and Article II, § 8 of the Ariz ona\nConstitution (Counts 4 and 5)\n6\nGovernor Brewer moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims that S.B. 1070 violates the\n7\nFourth Amendment and Article II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution. (Brewer MTD at 21-24.)\n8\nThe Complaint alleges that Section 2 of S.B. 1070 requires officers to conduct unreasonable\n9\nseizures of individuals and authorizes officers to detain individuals without lawful authority\n10\nand transport them into federal custody, all in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (Compl.\n11\n¶¶ 196, 198.) The Complaint also alleges that Sections 2 and 6 violate the Fourth Aemndment\n12\nby permitting “warrantless seizures of individuals in the absence of probable cause that they\n13\nhave committed crimes.” (Id. ¶ 197.) The Complaint further states that unspecified portions\n14\nof  S.B. 1070 viola te  the  Arizona Constitution by “requiring that officers conduct\n15\ninvestigatory  stops without reasonable suspicion of crim inal  activity,” perm itting\n16\n“warrantless seizures of individuals in the absence of probable cause that they have\n17\ncommitted crimes,” and extending “this broad, warrantless arrest authority to the context of\n18\nan individual’s home.” (Id. ¶¶ 201-03.)\n19\nThe Fourth Amendment protects the right to be free from unreasonable searches and\n20\nseizures and states that warrants must be supported by probable cause. U.S. Const. amend.\n21\nIV.10 Article II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution states: “No person shall be disturbed in his\n22\nprivate affairs, or his hom e invaded, without authority of law.” Arizona courts have\n23\ninterpreted Article II, § 8 of the state constitution as providing broader protection against\n24\nsearches and seizures than the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.S ee Moulé ex rel.\n25\nMoulé v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69, 863 F. Supp. 1098, 1102 (D. Ariz. 1994)\n26\n27\n10 The Fourth Amendment is applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment. City\n28 of Ontario, Cal. v. Quon, 130 S. Ct. 2619, 2624 (2010).\n- 28 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 29 of 38\n1 (citing Arizona state law), rev’d on other grounds, 66 F.3d 335 (9th Cir. 1995).11 \n2 a. Fourth Amendment\n3 Governor Brewer argues that Section 2 does not authorize unreasonable seizures in\n4 violation  of the Fourth Am endment  because it is not unreasonable to inquire about\n5 immigration status in connection with an otherwise lawful stop, detention, or arrest. (Brewer\n6 MTD at 22.) The Court assumes that Plaintiffs challenge Subsection 2(B), as none of the\n7 other subsections appears to significantly implicate the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme\n8 Court has held that questioning by police does not constitute a discrete Fourth Amendment\n9 event, such that police would need independent reasonable suspicion to ask the questions.\n10 See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93, 100-01 (2005). The questioning at issue in  Muehler\n11 related to immigration status, among other things. Id. Subsection 2(B) pertains to situations\n12 in which the police have already made a lawful stop, detention, or arrest, and Subsection 2(B)\n13 also requires reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence in the United States. This theory for\n14 violation of the Fourth Amendment is unavailing.12\n15 Plaintiffs also argue that the extension of a person’s detention during the time it takes\n16\n11 Where state and federal constitutional provisions are not coterminous, courts are\n17\ndirected to attempt to avoid federal constitutional questions by instead resolving the case on\n18 state constitutional grounds, if possible. See Ellis v. City of La Mesa, 990 F.2d 1518, 1524\n(9th Cir. 1993). Here, because the Arizona Constitution is more protective of the right to be\n19\nfree from searches and seizures than the Fourth Amendment is, the Court begins with the\n20 federal analysis. If the Court were to conclude that Plaintiffs had stated a claim  that S.B.\n1070 violates Article II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution, the federal issue would still have\n21\nto be addressed because the Fourth Amendment affords less protection.\n22\n12 Plaintiffs argue that Subsection 2(B) applies to lawful stops and detentions for civil\n23 violations as well, so subsequent questioning regarding immigration status is a violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment. (Pls.’ Resp. at 35.) However, Subsection 2(B) requires reasonable\n24\nsuspicion that the person is unlawfully present, which provides an additional basis for the\ninquiry. Given the fact that investigatory questioning, on its own, does not typically pimlicate\n25\nthe Fourth Amendment, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim that Subsection\n26 2(B) violates the Fourth Amendment on this theory.S  ee Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Ct,. 542\nU.S. 177, 185 (2004) (“Asking questions is an essential part of police investigations. In the\n27\nordinary course a police officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating\n28 the Fourth Amendment.”)\n- 29 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 30 of 38\n1 to investigate and verify the person’s immigration status makes an investigatory stop into an\n2 arrest. (Pls.’ Resp. at 35-36.) The Court finds this argument more persuasive and concludes\n3 that Plaintiffs have stated a claim  that Subsection 2(B) violates the Fourth Am endment\n4 because it impermissibly extends detention time for people who are stopped, detained, or\n5 arrested while their immigration status is checked if the officer has reasonable suspicion that\n6 the person is unlawfully present. Plaintiffs have alleged facts supporting a plausible inference\n7 that this extension arguably changes the encounter from  an investigatory stop perm itted\n8 under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1983), into an arrest. In order to make an arrest, the\n9 Fourth Amendment requires the officer to have probable cause, a much higher standard than\n10 the reasonable suspicion required in Subsection 2(B)S. ee Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146,\n11 152 (2004) (“In conformity with the rule at common law, a warrantless arrest by a law officer\n12 is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where there is probable cause to believe that a\n13 criminal offense has been or is being committed.” (citations omitted)).\n14 This reasoning also applies to the second sentence of Subsection 2(B): “Any person\n15 who is arrested shall have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is\n16 released.” A.R.S. § 11-1051(B). Plaintiffs ha ve stated a claim that this requirement also\n17 violates the Fourth Amendment because they have alleged facts plausibly suggesting that it\n18 will lengthen detention tim e for arrestees while their im migration status is determ ined.\n19 Arizona law permits law enforcement officers to cite and immediately release people arrested\n20 for  certain offenses. A.R.S. § 13-3903. Give n  that,  using this procedure, people are\n21 technically “arrested” but never booked into jail or perhaps even transported to a law\n22 enforcement facility, detention time for this category of arrestee will be extended during an\n23 immigration status verification.13\n24\n13 The Court also notes that information from another related case indicates that the\n25\nnumber of people impacted by this procedure is substantial. (See Escobar v. City of Tucson,\n26 No. CV 10-249-TUC-SRB, Doc. 9, City of Tucson’s Answer & Cross-cl. E(“scobar Answer\n& Cross-cl.”), ¶ 38 (stating that during fiscal year 2009, Tucson used the cite-and-release\n27\nprocedure provided by A.R.S. § 13-3903 to “arrset” and immediately release 36,821 people).)\n28\n- 30 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 31 of 38\n1 Section 6 amends A.R.S. § 13-3883 to permit officers to make warrantless arrests if\n2 the officer has probable cause to believe that “the person to be arrested has committed any\n3 public offense that m akes the person rem ovable from the United S tates.” A.R.S. § 13-\n4 3883(A)(5). Governor Brewer asserts that “[t]he commission of a public offense that makes\n5 a person removable from the United States will often involve the commission of a crime.”\n6 (Brewer MTD at 22-23 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1227).) Therefore, Governor Brewer argues, as a\n7 warrantless arrest is proper if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person\n8 committed a crime, Section 6 can be applied in a constitutional manner, and for purposes of\n9 a facial challenge, Plaintiffs have not stated a claim. (Brewer MTD at 23.) \n10 As discussed in more detail with regard to Plaintiffs’ vagueness argum ents, it is\n11 unclear how Section 6 alters the authority officers in Arizona already have  to make\n12 warrantless arrests, and Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the provision is unconstitutionally\n13 vague because there is no list of crim es that make a person removable from the U.S., a\n14 complicated determination ultimately made by federal officials, not a state law enforcement\n15 officer in the field. See supra Part II.B.4.b.iii. The Court finds that, f or the same reason,\n16 Plaintiffs have stated a claim that Section 6 violates the Fourth Amendment. Plaintiffs have\n17 alleged sufficient facts suggesting that, because an Arizona law enforcement officer cannot\n18 make a determination that a public offense makes the person removable from the U.S., any\n19 arrest made under Section 6 would, in fact, not be based on probable cause that the public\n20 offense makes the arrestee removable from the U.S.  See Devenpeck, 543 U.S. at 152. 14\n21 Plaintiffs have stated a claim that Sections 2 and 6 violate the Fourth Amendment in that they\n22 permit unconstitutional seizures and detentions. Governor Brewer’s Motion is denied in this\n23 regard.\n24 Governor Brewer also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim that Section 2 improperly\n25\n26 14 The Court notes again that under other subsections of A.R.S. § 13-3883(A), officers\nmay already make warrantless arrests if they have probable cause to believe that the person\n27\nto be arrested committed a felony, misdemeanor, petty offense, or certain criminal traffic\n28 violations. See A.R.S. § 13-3883(A)(1)-(4).\n- 31 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 32 of 38\n1 authorizes state law enforcement officials to “transport individuals into federal custody.”\n2 (Brewer MTD at 23; see also Compl. ¶ 198.) Section 2 provides that \n3 a law enforcement agency may securely transport an alien whom the agency\nhas received verification is unlawfully present in the United States and who is\n4 in the agency’s custody to a federal facility in this state or to any other point\nof transfer into federal custody that is outside the jurisdiction of the law\n5 enforcement agency.\n6 A.R.S. § 11-1051(D). Plaintiffs do not address this theory in their Response and cite no\n7 authority stating that state law enforcement agencies may not transport  a lawfully-detained\n8 person in their custody. Section 2(D) requires that verification of the person’s unlawful\n9 presence be obtained and that the person already be in the agency’s custody before the\n10 transportation occurs. Plaintiffs have not stated a claim that this provision plausibly violates\n11 the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Means, 252 F. App’x 830, 834 (9th Cir. 2007)\n12 (unpublished) (“[Plaintiff] cites no authority holdnig the transportation of a lawfully detained\n13 individual violates the Fourth Amendment, and we have found none.”). Governor Brewer’s\n14 Motion is granted as to this argument.\n15 b. Article II, § 8\n16 Most of Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the state constitution mirror those related to\n17 the Fourth Amendment, so the Court’s analysis of the federal standard applies. See Moulé,\n18 863 F. Supp. at 1102. However, Governor Brewer also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ state\n19 constitutional claim that “S[.]B[.] 1070 violates the Arizona Constitution’s gua rantee by\n20 requiring that officers conduct investigatory stops without reasonable suspicion of criminal\n21 activity.” (Brewer MTD at 24; Com pl. ¶ 201.) The Com plaint does not specify which\n22 provision of S.B. 1070 is being challenged under this theory, or for that matter, under the\n23 Arizona Constitution generally. (Compl. ¶¶ 199-203.) Assuming that this challenge relates\n24 to Subsection 2(B), the  Court finds that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim  sufficient to\n25 withstand a challenge under Rule 12(b)(6). Nowhere does Subsection 2(B) state that officers\n26 may or must conduct “investigatory stops” without reasonable suspicion. Governor Brewer’s\n27 Motion is granted as to this theory.\n28\n- 32 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 33 of 38\n1 6. Right to Travel (Count 7)\n2 The right to travel from  one state to another is a fundam ental right arising from\n3 various clauses of the U.S. Constitution, including the Privileges and Immunities Clause of\n4 Article IV and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Att’y\n5 Gen. of N.Y. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 901-02 (1986). As discussed above, no Plaintiff\n6 has standing to assert a claim for violations of the right to travel. See supra Part II.A.1.a.iii.\n7 C.  Additional Challenges to Plaintiffs’ Claims\n8 Defendants Babeu and Walsh also assert that Palintiffs have failed to plead a short and\n9 plain statement of the claim as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. (Pinal Cnty.\n10 Defs.’ MTD at 3-4.) This argument is essentially a challenge to the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’\n11 Complaint. The sufficiency of the Com plaint is discussed above.  See supra Part II.B.\n12 Defendant  Arpaio also asserts that “designating this action as a ‘Class Action’ is\n13 inappropriate . . . because if  [S.B.] 1070 is declared unconstitutional, it will be so for\n14 everyone, not just ‘class members.’” (Arpaio MTD at 9-10.) Defendant Arpaio’s challenge\n15 to the appropriateness of alleging these claims as a class action is without merit. As Plaintiffs\n16 point out, class actions commonly challenge the constitutionality of legislation.  See, e.g.,\n17 Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). Further, the appropriateness of class certification has not\n18 yet been determined.\n19 D. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n20 Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed on June 21, 2010. Plaintiffs\n21 make  three main  arguments  in their Moti on:  (1) S.B. 1070 is preem pted  by fe deral\n22 immigration law (Pls.’ Mot. at 9-24); (2) S.B. 1070 violates the constitutional right to travel\n23 (id. at 24-28); and (3) S.B. 1070 violates the First Am endment (id. at 28-32).  The Court\n24 entered a preliminary injunction in the related case United States v. Arizona, CV 10-1413-\n25 PHX-SRB, on July 28, 2010. (See USA Order at 35-36.) In that Order, the Court found that\n26 the United States was likely to succeed on the merits of its argument that certain portions of\n27 S.B. 1070 were preem pted by federal law, that the United Sta tes was likely to suffer\n28 irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief, and that the balance of equities tipped\n- 33 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 34 of 38\n1 in the United States’s favor considering the public interest. ( See id. at 4.) Therefore, the\n2 Court preliminarily enjoined the following Sections of S.B. 1070:\n3 Portion of Section 2 of S.B. 1070 \nA.R.S. § 11-1051(B): requiring that an officer make a reasonable attempt to\n4 determine the immigration status of a person stopped,\ndetained or arrested if there is a reasonable suspicion that\n5 the person is unlawfully present in the United States, and\nrequiring verification of the im migration status of any\n6 person arrested prior to releasing that person\nSection 3 of S.B. 1070 \n7 A.R.S. § 13-1509: creating a crime for the failure to apply for orc arry alien\nregistration papers\n8\nPortion of Section 5 of S.B. 1070 \n9 A.R.S. § 13-2928(C): creating a crime for an unauthorized alien to solicit,\napply for, or perform work\n10\nSection 6 of S.B. 1070 \n11 A.R.S. § 13-3883(A)(5): authorizing the warrantless arrest of a personw  here there\nis probable cause to believe the person has committed a\n12 public offense that makes the person removable from the\nUnited States\n13\n(Id.) \n14\nPlaintiffs in the instant matter do not substantively challenge any provisions of S.B.\n15\n1070 that were not enjoined by the Court in the USA Order, although Plaintiffs do challenge\n16\nthe relevant provisions on some different grounds. (See Hr’g Tr. 34:8-37:15, July 22, 2010;\n17\nsee also Pls.’ Mot. at 3-5, 9-32.) Plaintiffs acknowledge that the Court’s findings regarding\n18\nthe preliminary injunction entered in United States v. Arizona, if applied to their Motion for\n19\nPreliminary Injunction, “would fully resolve Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief.” (Pls.’\n20\nReq. at 1.) Plaintiffs seek a ruling on their Motion for Prelim inary Injunction in order to\n21\napply the USA Order to Defendants not named in United States v. Arizona and to enable\n22\nthese Plaintiffs “to participate fully and have their voices heard in litigation in the Court of\n23\nAppeals that could effectively decide many of their claims.” (Id. at 2.) The Court finds that\n24\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction is rendered moot by the preliminary injunction\n25\nentered in United States v. Arizona. No additional provisions of S.B. 1070 are specifically\n26\nchallenged by these Plaintiffs, so there is nothing else to enjoin.\n27\nFurther,  the Court concluded  supra  that Plaintiffs’ a rguments  regarding the\n28\n- 34 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 35 of 38\n1 constitutional right to travel and the First Amendment challenge to A.R.S. § 13-2928(C) are\n2 unavailing. Although the Court denied Governor Brwe er’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ First\n3 Amendment claim against A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B), Plaintiffs stated at the hearing on\n4 these Motions that they did not seek to preliminarily enjoin these provisions on First\n5 Amendment grounds. (See Hr’g Tr. 81:21-23 (Plaintiffs’ counsel: “[I] n light of Redondo\n6 Beach, we would withdraw our First Amendment P.I. request with respect to subsections (a)\n7 and (b) at this time.”).) Plaintiffs’ preemption arguments are no different from those made\n8 by the United States in United States v. Arizona, which were thoroughly addressed in the\n9 USA Order. \n10 If Plaintiffs’ Motion were not moot, the Court would have found one additional theory\n11 persuasive in considering whether to enjoin Subsection 2(B) of S.B. 1070 prior to its\n12 enactment, namely the Fourth Amendment challenge. (See USA Order at 16 n.6 (“The Court\n13 is also cognizant of the potentially serious Fourth Amendment problems with the inevitable\n14 increase in length of detention while im migration status is determined, as raised by the\n15 plaintiffs in Friendly House, et al. v. Whiting, et al., No. CV 10-1061-PHX-SRB.”).) The\n16 Intervenor Defendants responded to this argument in their Response toA  micus Curiae Briefs\n17 Filed in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Defs.’ Amicus Resp.”)\n18 (Doc. 402).  \n19  “A plaintiff seeking a prelim inary injunction must establish that he is likely to\n20 succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of\n21 preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in\n22 the public interest.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008)\n23 (citations  omitted).  Amicus Curiae   Arizona Attorneys for Crim inal  Justice  (“AACJ”)\n24 explains in its Brief in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction the ways in\n25 which the mandatory immigration determination upon arrest provisions of Subsection 2(B)\n26 implicate the Fourth Amendment and lead to Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits\n27 of this theory. (See Doc. 336, Proposed Amicus Curiae Br. by Ariz. Att’ys for Crimina l\n28 Justice in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. (“AACJ Br.”) at 3-6, 9-10; Doc. 282, Order Granting Mot. for\n- 35 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 36 of 38\n1 Leave to File Amicus Curiae Br.)15\n2 AACJ argues that Subsection 2(B) violate sthe Fourth Amendment by requiring police\n3 to detain people longer than constitutionally permissible in order to determine immigration\n4 status. (AACJ Br. at 4-5.) Subsection 2(B) provides:\n5 For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by [an Arizona] law enforcement\nofficial or . . . law enforcement agency . . . in the enforcement of any other law\n6 or ordinance of a county, city or town of this state where reasonable suspicion\nexists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States,\n7 a reasonable attempt shall be m ade, when practic able, to determine the\nimmigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or\n8 obstruct an investigation.\n9 A.R.S. § 11-1051(B). Subsection 2(B) also state,s “Any person who is arrested shall have the\n10 person’s immigration status determined before the person is released.” Id. \n11 The Court finds compelling AACJ’s argument that Subsection 2(B) of  S.B. 1070\n12 “transforms investigatory stops into de facto arrests without probable cause.” (AACJ Br. at\n13 9.) The Court addressed this a rgument above, in the context of Defendants’ Motion to\n14 Dismiss, finding that Plaintiffs had stated a claim sufficient to withstand a motion under Rule\n15 12(b)(6), and the Court now considers whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits\n16 of this theory. The requirement that police officers make a reasonable attempt to determine\n17 the immigration status of any person lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested when the officer\n18\n19 15 District courts have broad discretion to appoint or rejecta  mici curiae. Hoptowit v.\nRay, 682 F.2d 1237, 1260 (9th Cir. 1982), abrogated in part on other grounds by Sandin v.\n20\nConnor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995). Amici may properly “take a legal position and present legal\n21 arguments in support of it.” Funbus Sys., Inc. v. Cal. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 801 F.2d 1120,\n1125 (9th Cir. 1986) (citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held, “In the\n22\nabsence of exceptional circumstances . . . we do not address issues raised only in an amicus\n23 brief.” Artichoke Joe’s Grand Cal. Casino v. Norton, 353 F.3d 712, 719 n.10 (2003) (citing\nSwan v. Peterson, 6 F.3d 1373, 1383 (9th Cir. 1993)). In this case, the Fourth Amendment\n24\nchallenge is contained in the Complaint, has been responded to in the preliminary injunction\ncontext by Defendants, and is discussed purely to demonstrate that this theory would have\n25\nbeen compelling had the Court not already entered a preliminary injunction of the pertinent\n26 provision on other grounds and instead engaged in a full Fourth Amendment analysis with\nregard to preliminary injunctive relief. (See Compl. ¶¶ 3, 194-98; Defs.’ Amicus Resp. at 5.)\n27\nThe Fourth Amendment challenge was also addressed by the parties in their briefing on\n28 Governor Brewer’s Motion to Dismiss. (See Brewer MTD at 21-24; Pls.’ Resp. at 35-37.)\n- 36 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 37 of 38\n1 has reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is unlawfully present appears, on its face,\n2 to likely increase detention time for many people who are stopped, detained, or arrested. As\n3 AACJ points out, detaining people for the additional time necessary to make a determination\n4 of immigration status will change the encounter for many from an investigatory Terry stop\n5 into an arrest, for which the police officer would need to have probable cause,  not the\n6 reasonable suspicion required by S.B. 1070. (See id. at 9-10); Herring v. United States, 129\n7 S. Ct. 695, 698 (2009) (observing that the Fourth Amendment “usually requires the police\n8 to have probable cause or a warrant before making an arrest”).\n9 The second sentence of Subsection 2(B) states: “Any person who is arrested shall\n10 have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is released.” A.R.S. § 11-\n11 1051(B). This provision is mandatory (“shall”) and does not pertain only to people who are\n12 arrested and booked into a jail. The Court observes that serious que stions also exist as to\n13 whether this sentence violates the Fourth Amendment. See Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S.\n14 200, 212 (1979) (holding that extensions of investigatory stops beyond the scope permitted\n15 in Terry must be based on consent or probable cause (citingU nited States v. Brignoni-Ponce,\n16 422 U.S. 873, 881-82 (1975)).\n17 Requiring  Arizona law enforc ement  officials and agencies to determ ine  the\n18 immigration status of every person who is arrested will, on its face, impermissibly expand\n19 the scope of detention for many arrestees because their liberty will be restricted while their\n20 status is checked. As stated above, m any people each year are technically “arrested” but\n21 never booked into jail or perhaps even transported to a law e nforcement facility, and\n22 detention time for this category of arrestee will inevitably be extended during an immigration\n23 status verification. (See Escobar Answer & Cross-cl., ¶ 38 (stating that during fiscal year\n24 2009, Tucson used the cite-and-release procedure provided by A.R.S. § 13-3903 to “arrest”\n25 and immediately release 36,821 people).) \n26 Since the Court previously found that the United States was likely to succeed on its\n27 challenge  to this provision on preem ption  grounds, re ndering  Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n28 Preliminary Injunction moot, the Court does not engage in a full prelim inary injunction\n- 37 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 447    Filed 10/08/10   Page 38 of 38\n1 analysis on Fourth Amendment grounds. However, there appear to be substantial questions\n2 as to whether Subsection 2(B) would withstand a challenge under the Fourth Amendment,\n3 and some of the facts supplied, both in this case and the related cases, suggest that Plaintiffs\n4 could demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\n5 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED granting in part and denying in part the Motions\n6 to Dismiss filed by Defendants Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu and Pinal County Attorney\n7 James P. Walsh (Doc. 204), Defendant Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio (Doc. 205),\n8 and Intervenor Defendant Arizona Governor Janice K. Brewer (Doc. 238).  The following\n9 of Plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed for lack of standing:\n10 • violation of the First Amendment (Count 3) only as far as Plaintiffs challenge Section\n11 2 of S.B. 1070;\n12 • violation of the right to travel under the Privileges and Immunities Clause (Count 7).\n13 Plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for the following claims:\n14 • violation of the First Amendment (Count 3) only as far as Plaintiffs challenge A.R.S.\n15 § 13-2928(C) of Section 5 of S.B. 1070;\n16 • violation of the Due Process Clause (Count 6) only as far as Plaintiffs challenge\n17 Sections 2 and 5 of S.B. 1070 for vagueness.\n18 Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss are denied for the balance of Plaintiffs’ claims.\n19 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED denying as moot Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary\n20 Injunction (Doc. 235) and Request for Order on Pending Motion (Doc. 430).\n21\n22 DATED this 8th day of October, 2010.\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n- 38 -",

Whiting, et al., \n \n13 \nDefendants, \n \n14 \nand \n \n15 \nDouglas A. Ducey and the State of Arizona, \n16   \nIntervenor Defendants. \n17   \n18    At issue are Plaintiffs’ and Intervenor Defendants’ (“Arizona”) motions for partial \n19  summary judgment. (See Doc. 1215, Intervenor Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. re: Counts One, \n20  Two, Four, Five, Six, and Seven of the FAC (“Arizona’s Mot.”); Doc. 1223, Pls.’ Mot. \n21  for Partial Summ. J. and for Permanent Inj. (“Pls.’ Mot.”) & Doc. 1223-1, Pls.’ Mem. of \n22  Points and Authorities in Supp. of Mot. and Permanent Inj. Req. (“Pls.’ Mem.”).) \n23  I.  BACKGROUND \n24    This case is a facial challenge to the Arizona law commonly known as S.B. 1070, \n25  a set of statutes and statutory amendments enacted in 2010 to address immigration-related \n26  issues in Arizona. (See Doc. 447, Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 1-4 (summarizing S.B. 1070’s \n27  historical background and provisions)); United States v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d 980, \n28  985-91 (D. Ariz. 2010) (same), aff’d, 641 F.3d 339 (9th Cir. 2011), aff’d in part, rev’d in \n \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 2 of 23\n \n \n \n1  part, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012).1 The enactment of S.B. 1070 led to this suit and the related \n2  pre-enforcement facial challenge in United States v. Arizona, in which the United States \n3  filed suit to enjoin S.B. 1070 as preempted. (See Arizona, No. 10-CV-01413-PHX-SRB, \n4  Doc. 1, Compl.) The Arizona case is now resolved. Plaintiffs’ challenge to S.B. 1070 \n5  includes, but is not limited to, preemption theories. (See Doc. 511, First Am. Compl. for \n6  Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“FAC”) ¶¶ 177-82 (Count One – Supremacy Clause), \n7  183-88  (Count  Two  –  Equal  Protection  Clause),  189-91  (Count  Three  –  First \n8  Amendment), 192-96 (Count Four – Fourth Amendment), 197-200 (Count Five – Article \n9  II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution), 201-04 (Count Six – Due Process Clause), 205-08 \n10  (Count Seven – 42 U.S.C. § 1981).) (The federal constitutional claims are brought under \n11  42 U.S.C. § 1983.) \n12    Five years of rulings in these cases has narrowed the unresolved issues concerning \n13  S.B. 1070’s facial validity. In Arizona, the Supreme Court held that although Section 3 of \n14  S.B. 1070 was field preempted and that Sections 5(C) and 6 were conflict preempted, \n15  Section 2(B) was not preempted on its face. See Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. \n16  2492, 2501-10 (2012). The Court permanently enjoined Sections 3, 5(C), and 6. (See \n17  Arizona, Doc. 180, Sept. 18, 2012 Order.)2 The Court later permanently enjoined Section \n18  4, which amended the crime of human smuggling under A.R.S. § 13-2319. (See id., Doc. \n19  215, Nov. 7, 2014 Order.) Like the United States, Plaintiffs moved to enjoin various \n20  provisions of S.B. 1070. The Court preliminarily enjoined the portions of Section 5 \n21  codified under A.R.S. § 13-2929, which created a separate crime for certain smuggling \n22  activities. (Doc. 757, Sept. 5, 2012 Order); Valle del Sol v. Whiting, 2012 WL 8021265 \n23 \n                                              \n24  1 The Court refers to Senate Bill 1070 and House Bill 2162 collectively as “S.B. \n1070,”  describing  the  April  23,  2010  enactment  as  modified  by  the  April  30,  2010 \n25 \namendments. \n26  2 Section 3 made the failure to comply with federal alien registration requirements \na state misdemeanor. A.R.S. § 13-1509. Section 5(C) made it a misdemeanor for an \n27 \nunauthorized alien to seek or engage in work in Arizona. A.R.S. § 13-2928(C). Section 6 \nauthorized the warrantless arrest of a person where there was probable cause to believe \n28 \nthe person had committed any public offense that made the person removable from the \nUnited States. A.R.S. § 13-3883(A)(5). \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 3 of 23\n \n \n \n1  (D. Ariz. Sept. 5, 2012), aff’d, 732 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. \n2  1876 (2014). A.R.S. § 13-2929 is now permanently enjoined after the United States and \n3  Arizona reached a stipulation in Arizona. (See Arizona, Doc. 200, June 9, 2014 Order.) \n4  The Court also preliminarily enjoined the portions of Section 5 codified under A.R.S. \n5  § 13-2928(A) and (B) involving day labor prohibitions. (Doc. 604, Feb. 29, 2012 Order); \n6  Friendly House v. Whiting, 846 F. Supp. 2d 1053 (D. Ariz. 2012), aff’d sub nom. Valle \n7  Del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 709 F.3d 808 (9th Cir. 2013). The portions of S.B. 1070 that are \n8  not enjoined are now in effect. \n9    The  parties  filed  motions  for  partial  summary  judgment  after  the  close  of \n10  discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Together the partial summary judgment motions \n11  cover all counts in the First Amended Complaint. Arizona moves for summary judgment \n12  on  each  count  except  for  Plaintiffs’  First  Amendment  challenge  to  the  day  labor \n13  provisions  (Count  Three).  (See  Arizona’s  Mot.  at  2.)  Plaintiffs  move  for  summary \n14  judgment  on  their  First  Amendment  challenge  to  the  day  labor  provisions  and  their \n15  preemption challenge to Section 2(D) (Count One). (See Pls.’ Mot. at 1; Pls.’ Mem. at 5-\n16  29.) Plaintiffs ask the Court to permanently enjoin these provisions. (Id.)3 \n17  II.  LEGAL STANDARDS AND ANALYSIS \n18    Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is properly granted \n19  when: (1) there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact; and (2) after viewing the \n20  evidence most favorably to the non-moving party, the movant is clearly entitled to prevail \n21  as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 \n22  (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-89 (9th Cir. 1987). A fact is \n23  “material” when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of the \n24  case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A genuine dispute of \n25  material fact arises if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict \n26  for the nonmoving party.” Id. In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court \n                                              \n27 \n3 Because the Section 5 smuggling provisions are already unenforceable due to the \n28 \npermanent injunction order in Arizona, the Court denies as moot Plaintiffs’ other request \nto permanently enjoin A.R.S. § 13-2929. (See Pls.’ Mot. at 1; Pls.’ Mem. at 29-33.) \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 4 of 23\n \n \n \n1  must regard as true the non-moving party’s evidence if it is supported by affidavits or \n2  other evidentiary material, and “all inferences are to be drawn in the light most favorable \n3  to the non-moving party.” Eisenberg, 815 F.2d at 1289; see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. \n4  The  non-moving  party  may  not  merely  rest  on  its  pleadings;  it  must  produce  some \n5  significant  probative  evidence  tending  to  contradict  the  moving  party’s  allegations, \n6  thereby creating a material question of fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57 (holding that \n7  the plaintiff must present affirmative evidence to defeat a properly supported motion for \n8  summary judgment); First Nat’l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289 \n9  (1968). \n10    A.  Arizona’s Motion \n11    Arizona  contends  that  after  the  rulings  in  this  case  and  in  Arizona Plaintiffs’ \n12  remaining claims are that: Section 2 of S.B. 1070 violates the Supremacy Clause, the \n13  Equal  Protection  Clause,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1981;  Section  2(B)  violates  the  Fourth \n14  Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and Article II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution; and \n15  the Section 5 day labor provisions codified under A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) violate \n16  the  First  Amendment.  (Arizona’s  Mot.  at  2.)  Arizona  argues  that  Plaintiffs’  First \n17  Amendment  challenge  is  the  only  claim  that  involves  triable  issues  that  cannot  be \n18  resolved on summary judgment. (Id.) Plaintiffs do not dispute Arizona’s contentions \n19  about what claims remain against S.B. 1070, except Plaintiffs contend that their claims \n20  alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 are not limited to \n21  Section 2 but challenge S.B. 1070 in its entirety. (See Doc. 1252, Pls.’ Memo. of Law in \n22  Opp’n to Arizona’s Mot. (“Pls.’ Opp’n”) at 9.) Plaintiffs note that the Court allowed \n23  these claims to proceed past the pleading stage in ruling on Arizona’s motion to dismiss. \n24  (Id. at 9-10; see Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 15-18.) Plaintiffs acknowledge the Court’s prior \n25  statement that it cannot “declare an entire statute unconstitutional if the constitutional \n26  portions  can  be  severed  from  those  which  are  unconstitutional,”  but  Plaintiffs  argue \n27  “there will be nothing to sever if [they] ultimately prove that discriminatory intent was a \n28  motivating factor for the law in its entirety.” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 10 n.12 (citing Oct. 8, 2010 \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 5 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Order at 2 n.2).)4 \n2      1.  Section 2(B) (Counts One, Four, Five, and Six) \n3    Arizona argues that the Supreme Court’s opinion in Arizona prevents further facial \n4  challenges to Section 2(B). (See Arizona’s Mot. at 9-12.) Arizona moves for summary \n5  judgment on the counts challenging Section 2(B), which include part of Count One \n6  (Supremacy Clause) and all of Counts Four (Fourth Amendment), Five (Article II, § 8 of \n7  the Arizona Constitution), and Six (Due Process Clause). (Id.; see FAC ¶¶ 177-82, 192-\n8  204; Joint Proposed Case Management Plan at 3-4 (clarifying that Plaintiffs’ claims \n9  alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment and Due Process Clause are based on \n10  Section 2(B)).)5 Section 2(B) requires state law enforcement officers or agencies to make \n11  a “reasonable attempt . . . to determine the immigration status” of any person they stop, \n12  detain, or arrest on some other legitimate basis if “reasonable suspicion exists that the \n13  person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States.” A.R.S. § 11-1051(B). \n14  The  law  also  provides  that  “[a]ny  person  who  is  arrested  shall  have  the  person’s \n15  immigration status determined before the person is released.” Id. \n16    In Arizona, the Supreme Court held that Section 2(B) was not preempted on its \n17  face. See Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2507-10. After holding that “the mandatory nature of the \n18  status checks” under Section 2(B) did not interfere with federal immigration law, the \n                                              \n19 \n4 Plaintiffs have also alleged that S.B. 1070 in its entirety violates the Supremacy \n20 \nClause, but in Arizona, the Court refused “to enjoin S.B. 1070 as an integrated statutory \nenactment with interlocking provisions” on preemption grounds and “evaluate[d] the \n21 \nconstitutionality  of  the  individual  provisions  of  S.B.  1070  challenged  by  the  United \nStates.” Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d at 992-93; (see also FAC ¶ 180; Doc. 799, Joint \n22 \nProposed Case Management Plan at 2.) (In addressing Arizona’s motion to dismiss, the \nCourt “d[id] not address Plaintiffs’ claim alleging a violation of the [S]upremacy [C]lause \n23 \nas the Court already thoroughly addressed this issue in the [Arizona] Order.” (Oct. 8, \n2010 Order at 14 n.6.)) Consistent with Arizona, the Court must evaluate Plaintiffs’ \n24 \npreemption challenges in terms of “the individual provisions of S.B. 1070 challenged by \nPlaintiffs.” (See id. at 2 n.2.) Plaintiffs’ pleadings and papers have only identified Section \n25 \n2(B) and Section 2(D) as being preempted. \n26  5 Although the Joint Proposed Case Management Plan does not mention the claim \nunder  Article  II,  § 8  of  the  Arizona  Constitution,  this  claim,  like  Plaintiffs’  Fourth \n27 \nAmendment challenge, is based on allegations that S.B. 1070 authorizes unconstitutional \nwarrantless seizures and arrests. (See FAC ¶¶ 192-96); Ariz. Const. Art. II, § 8 (“No \n28 \nperson shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of \nlaw.”). \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 6 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Supreme Court addressed the second “constitutional concern” of “prolonged detention \n2  while the checks are being performed.” Id. at 2508-09. The opinion described the ways \n3  by  which  Arizona  courts  could  interpret  Section  2(B)  to  avoid  the  “constitutional \n4  concern” that “state officers will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no \n5  reason other than to verify their immigration status.” Id. at 2509 (“The state courts may \n6  conclude that, unless the person continues to be suspected of some crime for which he \n7  may be detained by state officers, it would not be reasonable to prolong the stop for the \n8  immigration inquiry.”) (“State courts may read [the second sentence of Section 2(B)—\n9  that ‘[a]ny person who is arrested shall have the person’s immigration status determined \n10  before [he] is released’—]as an instruction to initiate a status check every time someone \n11  is arrested, or in some subset of those cases, rather than as a command to hold the person \n12  until the check is complete no matter the circumstances.”). The Supreme Court reasoned \n13  that “if [Section] 2(B) only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the \n14  course  of  an  authorized,  lawful  detention  or  after  a  detainee  has  been  released,  the \n15  provision likely would survive preemption—at least absent some showing that it has \n16  other consequences that are adverse to federal law and its objectives.” Id. The Supreme \n17  Court  did  not  address  “whether  reasonable  suspicion  of  illegal  entry  or  another \n18  immigration crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a detention, or whether this \n19  too would be preempted by federal law.” Id. The opinion advised that “[t]he nature and \n20  timing of this case counsel[ed] caution in evaluating the validity of [Section] 2(B).” Id. at \n21  2510.  Noting  the  “basic  uncertainty  about  what  the  law  means  and  how  it  will  be \n22  enforced” at this stage, the opinion did not “foreclose other preemption and constitutional \n23  challenges to the law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.” Id. \n24    The issue of whether the Arizona opinion forecloses Plaintiffs’ facial challenges to \n25  Section 2(B) is not new. The Court addressed this issue when it denied Plaintiffs’ request \n26  to  preliminarily  enjoin  Section  2(B)  on  preemption,  Fourth  Amendment,  and  Equal \n27  Protection  grounds.  (See  Sept.  5,  2012  Order);  Valle  del  Sol,  2012  WL  8021265.6 \n                                              \n28 \n6 Plaintiffs initially appealed the denial of their preliminary injunction request, but \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 7 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs argued that the Arizona opinion did not foreclose their facial challenges to \n2  Section 2(B) because the Supreme Court did not have before it the record that exists in \n3  this case. Valle del Sol, 2012 WL 8021265, at *2. Plaintiffs interpreted their evidence to \n4  show that state officials would implement Section 2(B) in the same manner the Supreme \n5  Court  deemed  unconstitutional.  Id.  The  Court  rejected  this  argument  and  refused  to \n6  “ignore  the  clear  direction  in  the  Arizona  opinion  that  [Section]  2(B)  cannot  be \n7  challenged further on its face before the law takes effect.” Id. at *3 (“As the Supreme \n8  Court stated, Plaintiffs and the United States may be able to challenge the provision on \n9  other preemption and constitutional grounds ‘as interpreted and applied after it goes into \n10  effect.’” (quoting Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2510)). The Court denied Plaintiffs’ request to \n11  certify “a question to the Arizona Supreme Court as to whether [Section] 2(B) authorizes \n12  additional detention beyond the point a person would otherwise have been released, in \n13  order  to  determine  that  person’s  immigration  status.”  Id.  The  Court  explained  that \n14  “[g]iven the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court would be faced with the \n15  same issue that bars this Court’s consideration of Plaintiffs’ facial challenges to [Section] \n16  2(B). Without a set of as-applied facts, the Supreme Court has held that it would be \n17  speculative  to  decide  as  a  matter  of  law  that  [Section]  2(B)  will  be  enforced  in  an \n18  unconstitutional manner.” Id.; (see also Doc. 1233, Apr. 6, 2015 Order at 1-4 (denying a \n19  second certification motion regarding Section 2(B) because it was an untimely motion for \n20  reconsideration of the preliminary injunction request denial).) \n21    In responding to Arizona’s motion, Plaintiffs have not addressed the Court’s prior \n22  interpretation of the Arizona opinion. Plaintiffs generally make the same arguments the \n23  Court has already considered and rejected in the preliminary injunction stage. (See Pls.’ \n24  Opp’n at 1-3.) Plaintiffs narrowly interpret the Arizona opinion to address only whether \n25  the United States could prevail in its facial challenge to Section 2(B). (Id. at 2.) As in the \n26                                                                                                                                                    \nlater withdrew their Ninth Circuit appeal. Arizona cross-appealed the Court’s grant of a \n27 \npreliminary injunction against the Section 5 smuggling provisions, A.R.S. § 13-2929. The \nNinth Circuit affirmed on grounds that A.R.S. § 13-2929 was void for vagueness and \n28 \npreempted. See Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1019-29 (9th Cir. 2013), \ncert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1876 (2014). \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 8 of 23\n \n \n \n1  preliminary injunction stage, Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court could not determine \n2  Section 2(B)’s constitutionality based on the record at the time. (Id. at 5.) Plaintiffs \n3  interpret their evidence to show that Section 2(B) authorizes law enforcement officers to \n4  detain and arrest individuals solely to verify their immigration status. (Id. at 7-8 (citing \n5  Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board (“AZ POST”) training materials, a \n6  2010 Arizona Legislative Council legal opinion, former Arizona State Senator Russell \n7  Pearce’s testimony and statements, and three county sheriffs’ interpretations of Section \n8  2(B)); see Doc. 1253, Pls.’ Resp. to Intervenor Defs.’ Statement of Material Undisputed \n9  Facts in Supp. of Mot., and Pls.’ Statement of Additional Facts Precluding Summ. J. \n10  (“Pls.’ Resp. and Statement of Additional Facts”) ¶¶ P1-18.) \n11    The  Court  will  not  depart  from  its  prior  analysis.  Plaintiffs  are  attempting  to \n12  challenge a law that is not preempted on its face and could be interpreted to avoid the \n13  constitutional concerns mentioned in the Arizona opinion, including potential violations \n14  of the Fourth Amendment and the privacy protections in Article II, § 8 of the Arizona \n15  Constitution. See Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2509-10 (explaining that Arizona courts could \n16  interpret Section 2(B) on its face to avoid the “constitutional concern” that “state officers \n17  will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no reason other than to verify \n18  their immigration status”). The Supreme Court held there is a “basic uncertainty about \n19  what the law means and how it will be enforced . . . [, and] without the benefit of a \n20  definitive  interpretation  from  the  state  courts,  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  assume \n21  [Section] 2(B) will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.” Id. at \n22  2510; see also City of L.A. v.

Ct. 2443, 2450 (2015) (“[C]laims for facial \n23  relief under the Fourth Amendment are unlikely to succeed when there is substantial \n24  ambiguity  as  to  what  conduct  a  statute  authorizes:  Where  a  statute  consists  of \n25  ‘extraordinarily elastic categories,’ it may be ‘impossible to tell’ whether and to what \n26  extent it deviates from the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.” (quoting Sibron v. \n27  New  York,  392  U.S.  40,  59-60  &  n.20  (1968))).7  If  state  law  enforcement  agencies \n                                              \n28 \n7 The parties dispute how the standards in United States v.

See Arizona, 132 S.

Equal Protection Clause and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Counts Two and  \n9        Seven) \n10    Arizona moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims alleging violations of \n11  the Equal Protection Clause and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. (See Arizona’s Mot. at 12-17.) These \n12  claims are based on allegations that S.B. 1070 “was enacted with the purpose and intent \n13  to discriminate against racial and national origin minorities, including Latinos, on the \n14  basis  of  race  and  national  origin . . . [and]  impermissibly  and  invidiously  targets \n15  Plaintiffs[,] who are racial and national origin minorities.” (FAC ¶¶ 185-86; see also id. \n16  ¶ 208.) “The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no \n17  State shall ‘deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,’ \n18  which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” \n19  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).

(See Pls.’ Opp’n at 3-5; Doc. \n24 \n1264, Intervenor Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of Mot. (“Arizona’s Reply”) at 4); see United \nStates v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (“A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of \n25 \ncourse, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must \nestablish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”); Sprint \n26 \nTelephony PCS, L.P. v.

In cases \ninvolving federal preemption of a local statute, however, the rule applies with full force.” \n28 \n(citations omitted)). The Court does not need to find that Salerno precludes Plaintiffs’ \nSection 2(B) facial challenges when the Arizona opinion already does that. \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 10 of 23\n \n \n \n1  (purposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause will also violate 42 \n2  U.S.C. § 1981). \n3    Arizona  argues  it  is  entitled  to  summary  judgment  because  Plaintiffs  cannot \n4  establish that S.B. 1070, on its face, will have a discriminatory effect. (Arizona’s Mot. at \n5  12-15.) Arizona also argues that there is a lack of admissible evidence that S.B. 1070 was \n6  enacted with a discriminatory purpose. (Id. at 16-17; see also Doc. 927, Dec. 11, 2013 \n7  Order at 5 (explaining that “[t]o succeed on their Equal Protection challenge, Plaintiffs \n8  will  have  to  show,  among  other  things,  ‘[p]roof  of  racially  discriminatory  intent  or \n9  purpose’ in the enactment of S.B. 1070” (second alteration in original) (quoting Arlington \n10  Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977))).) Arizona’s argument on \n11  discriminatory purpose is based on a discovery dispute ruling that precludes Plaintiffs \n12  from opposing the summary judgment motion with facts that were not part of their \n13  interrogatory responses. (Arizona’s Mot. at 16-17; see Doc. 1192, Feb. 2, 2015 Minute \n14  Order  at  1-2.)  Arizona  contends  that  because  Plaintiffs  provided  only  conclusory \n15  allegations without supporting facts, the ruling precludes all of Plaintiffs’ factual support \n16  involving the discriminatory purpose element. (Arizona’s Mot. at 16-17.) If the evidence \n17  supporting these facts is admissible, Arizona does not argue that it is insufficient to create \n18  triable issues. (See Arizona’s Reply at 5-6.) \n19    It is undisputed that S.B. 1070 is a facially neutral law. Plaintiffs contend that S.B. \n20  1070 will have a disparate impact on Latinos in Arizona based on evidence that people \n21  from Mexico and Latin America comprise more of the foreign-born and undocumented \n22  immigrant population than other races. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 12-13 (citing Doc. 1217, Decl. \n23  of Stephanie Elliott in Supp. of Arizona’s Mot., Ex. C, Pls.’ Third Supplemental Resp. \n24  and Objections to Intervenor Defs.’ Interrogs. at 7-8 (stating that S.B. 1070 was expected \n25  and intended to have a disparate impact on, inter alia, Mexicans and Latinos)); Pls.’ \n26  Resp.  and  Statement  of  Additional  Facts  ¶¶ P19-22  (citing  evidence  estimating  that \n27  29.9% of all Arizona residents are Latino; that 64.7% of its foreign-born population is \n28  from Latin America; and that over 90% of undocumented immigrants in Arizona are \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 11 of 23\n \n \n \n1  from Mexico).) Plaintiffs argue that this evidence, paired with their evidence under the \n2  discriminatory purpose element, is sufficient to raise triable issues under the Arlington \n3  Heights analysis to preclude summary judgment on their Equal Protection and 42 U.S.C. \n4  § 1981 claims. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 12-13.) \n5    Under the discriminatory effect element of an Equal Protection claim, the parties \n6  dispute whether Plaintiffs must identify a “similarly situated” group that will be treated \n7  differently under S.B. 1070—i.e., Plaintiffs must demonstrate that state law enforcement \n8  officials will enforce the law differently for Latinos than a similarly situated person of \n9  another race or ethnicity. (See id. at 11; Arizona’s Reply at 8.) Plaintiffs argue that \n10  Arizona  is  attempting  to  import  irrelevant  concepts  from  “selective  prosecution”  or \n11  “selective enforcement” cases to their claims. (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 11); see United States v. \n12  Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 465 (1996) (“The requirements for a selective-prosecution \n13  claim  draw  on  ordinary  equal  protection  standards. . . . To  establish  a  discriminatory \n14  effect in a race case, the claimant must show that similarly situated individuals of a \n15  different race were not prosecuted.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n16  However, none of the authority Plaintiffs cite supports their argument that they do not \n17  have to show that a similarly situated group will be treated differently under S.B. 1070. \n18  See  Pimentel  v.  Dreyfus,  670  F.3d  1096,  1106  (9th  Cir.  2012)  (“To  state  an  equal \n19  protection claim of any stripe, . . . a plaintiff must show that the defendant treated the \n20  plaintiff differently from similarly situated individuals.”). \n21    In Arlington Heights, the issue was whether the defendants acted with proscribed \n22  discriminatory  intent.  Arlington  Heights  involved  allegations  that  the  plaintiffs  had \n23  allegedly suffered discriminatory treatment through the denial of a zoning permit request, \n24  but the absence of discriminatory purpose “end[ed] the constitutional inquiry,” making it \n25  unnecessary for the Supreme Court to address whether the challenged ordinance had “a \n26  discriminatory ‘ultimate effect.’” See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 271; see also Hunter \n27  v.  Underwood,  471  U.S.  222,  227  (1985)  (invalidating  a  provision  of  the  Alabama \n28  Constitution  under  the  Arlington  Heights  analysis  because  it  was  enacted  with  a \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 12 of 23\n \n \n \n1  discriminatory purpose and it had a discriminatory effect by disenfranchising African-\n2  Americans  at  a  higher  rate  than  whites  convicted  of  certain  non-felony  offenses). \n3  Plaintiffs also rely on the recent Ninth Circuit decision in Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968 \n4  (9th Cir. 2015), in which the court applied the Arlington Heights analysis to a law that \n5  eliminated a Mexican American Studies program in the Tucson public schools. (See Doc. \n6  1269, Not. of Supp. Authority.) Plaintiffs claim it is instructive that the Ninth Circuit \n7  relied on the fact that “sixty percent of all [Tucson Unified School District] students [are] \n8  of Mexican or other Hispanic descent, but also ninety percent of students in the [Mexican \n9  American  Studies,  or  ‘MAS’]  program  were  such.”  (Id.  at  1  (alteration  in  original) \n10  (quoting Arce, 793 F.3d at 978).) Plaintiffs compare these statistics to their own evidence. \n11  (Id.  at  1-2.)  Critically,  however,  the  law’s  enactment  and  enforcement  had  a \n12  discriminatory effect on similarly situated students, namely Mexican-American students \n13  as opposed to other students. Arce, 793 F.3d at 978.8 \n14    Because  Plaintiffs  have  admittedly  not  produced  any  evidence  that  state  law \n15  enforcement  officials  will  enforce  S.B.  1070  differently  for  Latinos  than  a  similarly \n16  situated person of another race or ethnicity, the Court grants summary judgment in favor \n17  of Arizona on Counts Two (Equal Protection Clause) and Seven (42 U.S.C. § 1981). The \n18  Court does not address Arizona’s alternative argument for summary judgment on these \n19  claims.9 \n                                              \n20 \n8 Plaintiffs also cite Pacific Shores Properties, LLC v. City of Newport Beach, 730 \n21 \nF.3d  1142  (9th  Cir.  2013),  cert.  denied,  135  S.  Ct.  436  (2014),  which  involved  a \nchallenge to an ordinance that “had the practical effect of prohibiting new group homes \n22 \nfrom opening in most residential zones.” Pacific Shores, 730 F.3d at 1147. Pacific Shores \ninvolved disparate treatment claims based on statutory laws. Id. at 1158 (“[Plaintiffs] who \n23 \nallege disparate treatment under statutory anti-discrimination laws need not demonstrate \nthe existence of a similarly situated entity who or which was treated better than the \n24 \nplaintiffs in order to prevail.”). That case did not purport to change the usual standards of \nproof for Equal Protection claims. \n25 \n9 Plaintiffs move to strike the responsive statement of facts Arizona filed with its \n26 \nreply.

Plaintiffs’ Motion \n2    Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their First Amendment challenge to the \n3  Section 5 day labor provisions, A.R.S. § 13-2928(A)-(B), and their preemption challenge \n4  to Section 2(D). (See Pls.’ Mot. at 1; Pls.’ Mem. at 5-29.) Plaintiffs ask the Court to \n5  permanently  enjoin  these  provisions.  (Id.)  In  addition  to  prevailing  on  the  merits,  a \n6  plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must show: “(1) that [he or she] has suffered an \n7  irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \n8  inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships \n9  between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the \n10  public  interest  would  not  be  disserved  by  a  permanent  injunction.”  eBay  Inc.  v. \n11  MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). \n12      1.  Section 5 – A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) (Count Three) \n13    Plaintiffs argue that the day labor provisions under A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) \n14  impose impermissible content-based restrictions on First Amendment protected speech \n15  and are not narrowly tailored to promote Arizona’s interest in traffic safety. (See Pls.’ \n16  Mem. at 5-20.) Plaintiffs contend that the record is virtually unchanged from when the \n17  Court preliminarily enjoined the day labor provisions. (Id. at 5; see Feb. 29, 2012 Order); \n18  Friendly  House,  846  F.  Supp.  2d  1053.  The  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed  the  preliminary \n19  injunction order. Valle Del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 709 F.3d 808 (9th Cir. 2013). \n20    A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) makes it unlawful for an occupant of a motor vehicle that is \n21  stopped on a street, roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic to attempt to hire a \n22  person for work at another location. A.R.S. § 13-2928(B) provides that it is unlawful for \n23  a person to enter a motor vehicle in order to be hired if the vehicle is stopped on a street, \n24  roadway, or highway and is impeding traffic. In the preliminary injunction stage, the \n25  Court and Ninth Circuit analyzed the day labor provisions as content-based commercial \n26                                                                                                                                                    \nmemorandum  for  the  underlying  motion  and  may  not  be  presented  in  a  separate \n27 \nresponsive  memorandum.”).  The  Court  denies  the  motion  as  moot.  None  of  the \ndispositive issues involving Arizona’s partial summary judgment motion required the \n28 \nCourt to consider the objections Arizona raised in the responsive statement of facts when \nthe reply fully addressed those issues. \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 14 of 23\n \n \n \n1  speech  restrictions  under  the  four-prong  test  the  Supreme  Court  set  out  in  Central \n2  Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557 \n3  (1980). Friendly House, 846 F. Supp. 2d at 1056-58; Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 818-20. \n4  The Central Hudson test first evaluates “whether the affected speech is misleading or \n5  related to unlawful activity. If not, the government bears the burden of showing that it has \n6  a  substantial  interest,  that  the  restriction  directly  advances  that  interest  and  that  the \n7  restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the interest.” Valle Del Sol, 709 \n8  F.3d at 816 (citations omitted).10 It is undisputed that the day labor provisions are subject \n9  to First Amendment scrutiny as restrictions on lawful, non-misleading speech and that \n10  Arizona has a substantial interest in traffic safety. (See Pls.’ Mem. at 8-9; Doc. 1245, \n11  Arizona’s Resp. in Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. (“Arizona’s Resp.”) at 2); Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d \n12  at 823. Even if the day labor provisions directly advance Arizona’s substantial interest in \n13  traffic  safety—an  issue  the  parties  disputed  in  the  preliminary  injunction  stage  and \n14  dispute  now  on  summary  judgment—the  restrictions  “‘must  not  be  more  extensive \n15  than . . . necessary to serve’ a substantial government interest—i.e., [they] should not be \n16  overinclusive.” Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 825 (quoting World Wide Rush, LLC v. City of \n17  L.A., 606 F.3d 676, 684 (9th Cir. 2010)); see also Posadas de Puerto Rico Assocs. v. \n18  Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 341 (1986) (“The last two steps of the Central \n19  Hudson analysis basically involve a consideration of the ‘fit’ between the legislature’s \n20 \n                                              \n21 \n10 The Court applied the standards in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653 \n22 \n(2011), to the day labor provisions, a case the Court interpreted as modifying Central \nHudson’s fourth prong to impose more demanding requirements on the state. Friendly \n23 \nHouse, 846 F. Supp. 2d at 1057-58 (“[I]f a ban on commercial speech is content-based, \nSorrell instructs that it must be ‘drawn to achieve’ ‘a substantial governmental interest,’ \n24 \nwhereas the Central Hudson test requires that the regulation not be ‘more extensive than \nis necessary to serve that interest.’”). The Ninth Circuit declined to address “[w]hether \n25 \nSorrell  intended  to  make  the  commercial  speech test  more  exacting  for  the  state  to \nmeet . . . because . . . [P]laintiffs [we]re likely to succeed even under Central Hudson’s \n26 \nformulation of the standard and [the Ninth Circuit] cases interpreting it.” Valle Del Sol, \n709 F.3d at 825; see id. at 821 (“[We] defer extended discussion of Sorrell for a more \n27 \nappropriate case with a more fully developed factual record.”). The Ninth Circuit still has \nhad no occasion to clarify the application of Sorrell through an extended discussion; \n28 \nhowever, in this current posture, the day labor provisions are still deficient under the pre-\nSorrell Central Hudson standards. \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 15 of 23\n \n \n \n1  ends  and  the  means  chosen  to  accomplish  those  ends.”).11  Because  the  day  labor \n2  provisions  are  not  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  Arizona’s  substantial  interest  in  traffic \n3  safety, it is unnecessary to address whether Arizona’s evidence is sufficient to create \n4  genuine issues of material fact about whether the day labor provisions directly advance \n5  that traffic safety interest. This finding is consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s analysis \n6  addressing the preliminary injunction order on appeal. \n7    The Ninth Circuit held that “[P]laintiffs [we]re likely to succeed on the merits of \n8  their claim that the day labor provisions are overinclusive because they restrict more \n9  speech than necessary to serve Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.” Valle Del Sol, 709 \n10  F.3d at 827 (emphasis omitted). Arizona had not produced evidence that existing laws or \n11  other potential laws were insufficient to address “the traffic problems that may attend in-\n12  street  employment  solicitation.”  Id.  (emphasis  omitted).  The  opinion  listed  specific \n13  examples of traffic laws from the Ninth Circuit decision in Comite de Jornaleros de \n14  Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc), “that \n15  were  broad  enough  to  address  the  traffic  concerns  attending  in-street  employment \n16  solicitation without implicating speech.” Id. (listing California traffic laws from Redondo \n17  Beach that “prohibit[ed] jaywalking, stopping in traffic alongside a red-painted curb, \n18  stopping a car so as to obstruct the normal movement of traffic, standing in a roadway if \n19 \n                                              \n20  11  As  in  the  preliminary  injunction  stage,  Arizona  identifies  several  other \nsubstantial  interests  beyond  traffic  safety,  including  crime  reduction,  economic \n21 \ndevelopment, and protecting the aesthetics of its communities, but does not argue that the \nday labor provisions are narrowly tailored to achieve them. (See Arizona’s Resp. at 6-7.) \n22 \nThe Court will therefore not consider these interests in the analysis. See Valle Del Sol, \n709 F.3d at 823 n.4 (declining to address these proffered interests for the same reason). \n23 \nRegarding Central Hudson’s third prong, the Court previously found that the day \n24 \nlabor provisions, while “underinclusive to some degree,” still banned enough traffic-\nblocking  solicitation  that  they  directly  advanced  Arizona’s  interest  in  traffic  safety. \n25 \nFriendly House, 846 F. Supp. 2d at 1059. Although most of the evidence in the record \nwas “nonprobative” on the issue of whether the particular traffic problems caused by day \n26 \nlaborer solicitation were “more acute than the traffic safety concerns caused by other \ntypes of roadside communication,” “[o]ne officer did, however, represent that day laborer \n27 \ninteractions require the parties to negotiate multiple terms, and so take longer than other \ntypes of in-street solicitation.” See Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 824-25. The Ninth Circuit \n28 \ncalled this evidence “weak,” but concluded that the Court’s finding was not an abuse of \ndiscretion. Id. at 825. \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 16 of 23\n \n \n \n1  such action interferes with the lawful movement of traffic and standing or stopping \n2  except as near as is physically possible to the building line or the curb line” (internal \n3  quotation marks omitted)). The Ninth Circuit found “[n]othing in the record show[ing] \n4  that Arizona could not effectively pursue its interest in traffic safety by enforcing or \n5  enacting similar kinds of speech-neutral traffic safety regulations.” Id.  \n6    The Ninth Circuit also held that “[t]he day labor provisions are a poor fit with \n7  Arizona’s interest in traffic safety because, in this context, they are also underinclusive.” \n8  Id. at 827-28 (“That the day labor provisions are underinclusive is . . . relevant . . . to \n9  whether they satisfy Central Hudson’s no-more-extensive-than-necessary prong.”). The \n10  Ninth  Circuit  explained  that  the  Court  properly  “emphasized  S.B.  1070’s  purposes \n11  clause,[12] the fact that the day labor provisions provide penalties drastically out-of-\n12  proportion to those for other traffic violations[,] and the legislative record”—“factors all \n13  support[ing] the [C]ourt’s conclusion that the day labor provisions are underinclusive \n14  because  they  are  ‘structured  to  target  particular  speech  rather  than  a  broader  traffic \n15  problem.’” Id. at 828. The Ninth Circuit concluded the analysis by noting that \n16  Arizona could have advanced its interest in traffic safety directly, without \nreference to speech. The availability of such obvious and less-restrictive \n17  alternatives makes the day labor provisions overinclusive. They are also \nunderinclusive because they draw content-based distinctions that appear \n18  motivated  by  a  desire  to  eliminate  the  livelihoods  of  undocumented \nimmigrants rather than to address Arizona’s interest in traffic safety. \n19 \n20   Id. \n21    Arizona argues that there are factual disputes about whether Arizona traffic laws \n22  sufficiently  address  the  “unique  safety  concerns”  arising  from  in-street  employment \n23  solicitation. (Arizona’s Resp. at 7-8.) Arizona lists a number of state traffic laws and \n24  relies exclusively on one officer’s declaration about the purported shortcomings of these \n25  laws to “address the hazards of in-street employment solicitation.” (Id.; see Doc. 1246, \n                                              \n26 \n12 The purposes clause in Section 1 of S.B. 1070 states that “the intent of [S.B. \n27 \n1070] is to make attrition through enforcement the public policy of all state and local \ngovernment agencies in Arizona” and that “[t]he provisions of this act are intended to \n28 \nwork together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and \neconomic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States.” \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 17 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Arizona’s Controverting Statement of Facts and Supplemental Statement of Undisputed \n2  Material  Facts  ¶¶ 26-31  (citing  Doc.  553-3,  Second  Decl.  of  Daniel  Boyd).)  This \n3  declaration was part of the record in the preliminary injunction stage and not all of the \n4  statements  in  it  specifically  address  “the  traffic  problems  that  may  attend  in-street \n5  employment solicitation.” See Valle Del Sol, 709 F.3d at 827 (“The question is . . . not \n6  whether existing laws are sufficient to deal with in-street employment solicitation, but \n7  rather whether existing laws are sufficient to deal with the traffic problems that may \n8  attend in-street employment solicitation.”). Even if existing traffic laws are insufficient to \n9  address the traffic problems in-street employment solicitation may cause, there is no \n10  evidence that Arizona could not effectively pursue its interest in traffic safety by enacting \n11  other speech-neutral traffic safety regulations. Id. (“[O]ur consideration is not limited to \n12  Arizona’s actual traffic safety regulations, but includes any potential or actual traffic \n13  safety regulations that are obviously available.”). As the Ninth Circuit explained, “[the] \n14  government  must  consider  pursuing  its  interests  through  conduct-based  regulations \n15  before enacting speech-based regulations.” Id. The Court must find “that the day labor \n16  provisions are overinclusive because they restrict more speech than necessary to serve \n17  Arizona’s interest in traffic safety.” See id. The Court does not need to address if Arizona \n18  has offered sufficient controverting evidence to create factual issues about whether the \n19  day labor provisions are underinclusive.  \n20    Arizona does not dispute that the other permanent injunction requirements are met. \n21  See id. at 828-29 (affirming the preliminary injunction findings that Plaintiffs would \n22  suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, the equities favored Plaintiffs, and an \n23  injunction was in the public’s interest); see also Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n24  555 U.S. 7, 32 (2008) (citing case law for the rule that issuing a permanent injunction is \n25  essentially the same as for issuing a preliminary injunction except for the requirement to \n26  show actual success on the merits instead of a likelihood of success). The Court grants \n27  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Plaintiffs  on  Count  Three  (First  Amendment)  and \n28  permanently enjoins the Section 5 day labor provisions, A.R.S. § 13-2928(A)-(B). \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 18 of 23\n \n \n \n1      2.  Section 2(D) (Count One) \n2    Section 2(D) of S.B. 1070 provides: \n3  Notwithstanding any other law, a law enforcement agency may securely \ntransport an alien who the agency has received verification is unlawfully \n4  present in the United States and who is in the agency’s custody to a federal \nfacility in this state or to any other point of transfer into federal custody that \n5  is  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  law  enforcement  agency.  A  law \nenforcement  agency  shall  obtain  judicial  authorization  before  securely \n6  transporting an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States to a \npoint of transfer that is outside of this state. \n7 \n8  A.R.S. § 11-1051(D). Plaintiffs argue that Section 2(D) is conflict and field preempted \n9  based on their interpretation that the law authorizes state officials to detain and transport \n10  individuals based on civil removability without federal direction and supervision. (See \n11  Pls.’ Mem. at 21-29); United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d 339, 344 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The \n12  federal preemption doctrine stems from the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, \n13  and the fundamental principle of the Constitution that Congress has the power to preempt \n14  state law.” (alteration incorporated) (quoting Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 \n15  U.S. 363, 372 (2000))), rev’d on other grounds, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012).13 Because \n16  Plaintiffs compare Section 2(D) to the conflict preempted Section 6 provisions, and their \n17  preemption  challenge  centers  on  whether  the  law  conflicts  with  the  federal  removal \n18  system, it is appropriate to consider this challenge under the conflict preemption analysis, \n19  not the field preemption analysis. (Pls.’ Mem. at 21); see Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. v. \n20  Napolitano,  558  F.3d  856,  863  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (explaining  that  conflict  preemption \n21  occurs “when either ‘compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical \n22 \n                                              \n23  13 The United States did not challenge Section 2(D) in Arizona. See Arizona, 703 \nF. Supp. 2d at 986 (“[T]he United States has not made any argument to preliminarily \n24 \nenjoin . . . A.R.S.  § 11-1051(C)-(F)[,]  requiring  that  state  officials  work  with  federal \nofficials with regard to unlawfully present aliens[.]”). The Court previously dismissed \n25 \nPlaintiffs’ claim that Section 2(D) violated the Fourth Amendment by authorizing state \nlaw enforcement agencies to “transport individuals into federal custody,” but did not \n26 \naddress whether Plaintiffs could state a claim against Section 2(D) under a preemption \ntheory. (See Oct. 8, 2010 Order at 14 n.6, 32 (“Plaintiffs do not address this [dismissal] \n27 \ntheory in their Response and cite no authority stating that state law enforcement agencies \nmay not transport a lawfully-detained person in their custody.”).) The Court will not \n28 \nconsider Plaintiffs’ untimely and procedurally improper request for reconsideration of the \ndismissal. (See Pls.’ Mem. at 25 n.14); LRCiv 7.2(g)(2). \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 19 of 23\n \n \n \n1  impossibility,’ or where ‘state  law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and \n2  execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.’” (quoting Fid. Fed. Sav. & \n3  Loan Ass’n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153 (1982))), aff’d sub nom. Chamber of \n4  Commerce of U.S. v. Whiting, 563 U.S. 582 (2011). \n5    The general rule is that “it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in \n6  the  United  States.  If  the  police  stop  someone  based  on  nothing  more  than  possible \n7  removability, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent.” Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2505 \n8  (citation omitted). In Arizona, Section 6 was held to be conflict preempted because the \n9  law authorized state officials to make arrests for civil immigration violations, which \n10  would have “provide[d] state officers even greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis \n11  of  possible  removability  than  Congress . . . g[ave]  to  trained  federal  immigration \n12  officers.” Id. at 2506; see also A.R.S. § 13-3883(A)(5) (authorizing the warrantless arrest \n13  of a person “if the officer ha[d] probable cause to believe . . . [t]he person to be arrested \n14  ha[d] committed any public offense that ma[de] the person removable from the United \n15  States”).14  The  law  did  this  by  authorizing  “officers  who  believe[d]  an  alien  [wa]s \n16  removable by reason of some ‘public offense’ . . . [to] arrest on that basis regardless of \n17  whether a federal warrant [w]as issued or the alien [wa]s likely to escape. This state \n18  authority  could  be  exercised  without  any  input  from  the  Federal  Government  about \n19  whether an arrest [wa]s warranted in a particular case.” Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506. \n20    Plaintiffs argue that Section 2(D) operates like Section 6 to authorize the detention \n21  and transportation of individuals to federal immigration facilities for civil immigration \n22  violations. (Pls.’ Mem. at 21.) Plaintiffs interpret the phrase “[n]otwithstanding any other \n                                              \n23 \n14  The  opinion  summarized  the  removal  system  Congress  created  and  the \n24 \ncircumstances in which an individual can be arrested and detained during the removal \nprocess.  See  Arizona,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2505-06.  “[T]he  Attorney  General  can  exercise \n25 \ndiscretion to issue a warrant for an alien’s arrest and detention pending a decision on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United States, . . . [a]nd if an alien is ordered \n26 \nremoved  after  a  hearing,  the  Attorney  General  will  issue  a  warrant.”  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and 8 CFR § 241.2(a)(1)). “If no \n27 \nfederal warrant has been issued, . . . [federal officers] may arrest an alien for being in the \nUnited States in violation of any immigration law or regulation, for example, but only \n28 \nwhere the alien is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.” Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(a)). \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 20 of 23\n \n \n \n1  law” in Section 2(D) as instructing state officials to discard all state or federal limitations \n2  on their authority, and argue the only limitation on state officials’ authority occurs when \n3  an  individual  is  transported  out  of  Arizona.  (Id.  at  22.)  Plaintiffs  support  their \n4  interpretation with evidence from many of the same sources they relied on in the earlier \n5  Section 2(B) analysis, including the AZ POST training materials and interpretations of \n6  the law from state law enforcement officials, including county sheriffs. (Id. at 23-24; see \n7  Doc. 1224, Pls.’ Statement of Facts in Supp. of Mot. ¶¶ 179-90.) Plaintiffs read too much \n8  into the law. \n9    Section 2(D) requires that verification of an individual’s unlawful presence in the \n10  country be obtained and that the person be in state custody before being transported to a \n11  federal facility. A.R.S. § 11-1051(D). Unlike the preempted Section 6 provisions, which \n12  expanded the statutory list of offenses for which state officials were authorized to make a \n13  warrantless arrest, Section 2(D) addresses circumstances after an individual is already in \n14  custody. The law is not a source for state officials’ arrest or detention powers, consistent \n15  with its placement with other so-called cooperation provisions in Section 2. See A.R.S. § \n16  11-1051(C)-(F); FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) \n17  (“A court must . . . interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme \n18  and fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.” (citations and internal quotation \n19  marks omitted)). Whether state officials have legal custody is determined by laws outside \n20  of Section 2(D). The introductory phrase “[n]otwithstanding any other law” in Section \n21  2(D) cannot mean that all other applicable laws are displaced. Section 2(D) cannot be \n22  read on its face as authorizing detention for civil immigration violations. \n23    Plaintiffs also argue that Section 2(D) is preempted because it authorizes state \n24  officials  to  transport  individuals  to  federal  facilities  without  federal  direction  or \n25  supervision. (Pls.’ Mem. at 25-26.) Putting aside the inherent authority that state officials \n26  have to enforce federal criminal immigration laws, see Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, \n27  475-76 (9th Cir. 1983) (concluding that Arizona officers have authority to enforce the \n28  criminal provisions of federal immigration law), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-\n \n- 20 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 21 of 23\n \n \n \n1  Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 1999), federal law authorizes state and \n2  local officials to perform immigration enforcement duties under cooperation agreements \n3  and in other circumstances, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) (authorizing the federal \n4  government to enter into formal agreements with states and municipalities under which \n5  their officers may perform certain duties of a federal immigration officer); id. § 1252c \n6  (authorizing arrest and detention of previously removed aliens convicted of a felony); id. \n7  § 1324(c) (authorizing arrests for violations of the federal smuggling statute); accord \n8  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506 (citing these statutes). These duties can include transporting \n9  detainees. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) (noting that delegated state officials are “qualified to \n10  perform  a  function  of  an  immigration  officer  in  relation  to  the  investigation, \n11  apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States (including the transportation of \n12  such  aliens  across  State  lines  to  detention  centers)”).  Plaintiffs  acknowledge  the \n13  circumstances in which state officials can enforce federal immigration law, but their \n14  argument presumes that Section 2(D) must be read to exclude them. The verification and \n15  transport process the law recognizes is consistent with state officials’ enforcement actions \n16  taken under cooperation agreements and as authorized under the federal statutes listed \n17  above.15 Like Section 2(B), if state law enforcement agencies implement policies or \n18  practices based on Section 2(D) that raise constitutional concerns, that enforcement can \n19  be challenged in an as-applied case; however, the law is not facially preempted by federal \n20  immigration law.16 \n21    Because Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their preemption claims against Section 2(B) \n22 \n                                              \n23  15 The verification process in Section 2(D) contemplates cooperation agreements \nbetween Arizona and the federal government. See A.R.S. § 11-1051(E)(1) (“[A]n alien’s \n24 \nimmigration  status  may  be  determined  by . . . [a]  law  enforcement  officer  who  is \nauthorized  by  the  federal  government  to  verify  or  ascertain  an  alien’s  immigration \n25 \nstatus.”). \n26  16 This analysis also applies to Plaintiffs’ argument that Section 2(D) authorizes \nstate officials to unilaterally act without federal direction. (See Pls.’ Mem. at 24 (relying \n27 \non several state officials’ interpretations of Section 2(D)).) Because Section 2(D) can be \ninterpreted  to  cover  situations  in  which  federal  officials  request  state  officials’ \n28 \nassistance—a  situation  that  does  not  implicate  the  constitutional  concerns  Plaintiffs \nidentify—the law is not facially preempted. \n \n- 21 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 22 of 23\n \n \n \n1  and Section 2(D), the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Arizona on Count One \n2  (Supremacy Clause). Plaintiffs have not identified any other provision of S.B. 1070 they \n3  are challenging under Count One that is not enjoined. See supra n.4. \n4  III.  CONCLUSION \n5    Arizona is entitled to summary judgment on the remaining claims in Counts One \n6  (Supremacy Clause), Two (Equal Protection Clause), Four (Fourth Amendment), Five \n7  (Article II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution), Six (Due Process Clause), and Seven (42 \n8  U.S.C.  § 1981).  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  summary  judgment  on  Count  Three  (First \n9  Amendment).  The  Section  5  day  labor  provisions,  A.R.S.  § 13-2928(A)-(B),  are \n10  permanently enjoined. \n11    IT  IS  ORDERED  granting  Intervenor  Defendants’  Motion  for  Summary \n12  Judgment re: Counts One, Two, Four, Five, Six, and Seven of the FAC (Doc. 1215). \n13    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs’ \n14  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and for Permanent Injunction (Doc. 1223). \n15    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  denying  as  moot  Plaintiffs’  Motion  to  Strike \n16  Intervenor Defendants’ Responses and Objections to Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional \n17  Facts Precluding Summary Judgment (Doc. 1280). \n18    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED directing the Clerk to enter judgment in favor of \n19  Arizona  on  Counts  One  (Supremacy  Clause),  Two  (Equal  Protection  Clause),  Four \n20  (Fourth Amendment), Five (Article II, § 8 of the Arizona Constitution), Six (Due Process \n21  Clause), and Seven (42 U.S.C. § 1981). \n22    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED directing the Clerk to enter judgment in favor of \n23  Plaintiffs on Count Three (First Amendment). \n24  / / / \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n \n- 22 - \n\n \nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1285   Filed 09/04/15   Page 23 of 23\n \n \n \n1    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED permanently enjoining the Section 5 day labor \n2  provisions, A.R.S. § 13-2928(A)-(B). \n3   \n4    Dated this 4th day of September, 2015. \n5   \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9   \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 23 - ",

In \n3  the interest of the efficient resolution of this case, the Parties make the following \n4  representations and request that the Court enter the proposed final order.   \n5  The Parties have stipulated and agreed to resolve Valle del Sol v. Whiting, No. CV \n6  10-1061-PHX-SRB on the following terms: \n7  First, as part of its agreement with Plaintiffs, Intervenor Defendants will issue the \n8  attached Informal Attorney General Opinion, which provides guidelines on the \n9  implementation of Senate Bill 1070’s Section 2(b) and 2(d), among other sections.  The \n10  Informal Attorney General Opinion reflects the State’s interpretation of legal requirements \n11  and limitations for implementing Section 2(b) and 2(d).  The Informal Attorney General \n12  Opinion is attached as Exhibit A. \n13  Second, both parties stipulate that A.R.S. §§ 28-3511A (1)(d) and (e) should be \n14  enjoined, and ask this Court to enjoin those provisions.  These are impoundment \n15  provisions that apply when there is a predicate offense under the “harboring,” \n16  “transporting,” or “concealing” provisions codified at A.R.S. 13-2929, which have been \n17  enjoined in this litigation and a related case.  See Valle del Sol v. Whiting, No. CV 10-\n18  1061-PHX-SRB, 2012 WL 8021265 (D. Ariz. Sept. 5, 2012) (preliminary injunction); \n19  Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2013) (affirming preliminary \n20  injunction); United States v. Arizona, No. 2:10-cv-014013-SRB at Docket No. 200 \n21  (permanent injunction).  Thus, because there is no legal basis to enforce A.R.S. §§ 28-\n22  3511A(1)(d) and (e), the Parties stipulate that A.R.S. §§ 28-3511A(1)(d) and (e) should be \n23  permanently enjoined because it is unconstitutional. \n24  Third, the Plaintiffs further settle any claim they have for attorneys’ fees and costs \n25  related to this case, No. CV 10-1061-PHX-SRB, and all of its appeals for the sum of $1.4 \n26  million.  Intervenor Defendants agree to pay $1.4 million to Plaintiffs’ Counsel to resolve \n27  any liability for attorneys’ fees and costs from this case, No. CV 10-1061-PHX-SRB, and \n28  all of its appeals. \n \n  1   \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297   Filed 09/15/16   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  Fourth, upon approval by the Court of the proposed order filed herewith and the \n2  terms agreed to by the Parties, the Parties will not further challenge the Court’s ruling at \n3  Docket No. 1285 or any other rulings in this litigation.  See the Parties’ joint request for \n4  dismissal without prejudice filed with the Ninth Circuit attached as Ex.

In particular, \nthis policy is intended to articulate the constitutional limits demarcated in Rodriguez v. \nUnited States, 135 S. Ct. 1609 (2015); Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012); and \nMelendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2012), among other applicable authority.  \n \nI.  The Statute \n \nThe relevant sections of A.R.S. § 11-1051 provide: \n \nB.     For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement \nofficial or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement \nofficial or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political \nsubdivision of this state in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a \ncounty, city or town or this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the \nperson is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable \nattempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status \nof  the  person,  except  if  the  determination  may  hinder  or  obstruct  an \ninvestigation. Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration \nstatus determined before the person is released. The person's immigration \nstatus shall be verified with the federal government pursuant to 8 United \nStates Code § 1373(c). A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a \ncounty, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider \nrace, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this \nsubsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona \nConstitution. A person is presumed to not be an alien who is unlawfully \npresent in the United States if the person provides to the law enforcement \nofficer or agency any of the following: \n1. A valid Arizona driver license. \n2. A valid Arizona nonoperating identification license. \n3. A valid tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal identification. \n4. If the entity requires proof of legal presence in the United States before \nissuance, any valid United States federal, state or local government issued \nidentification. \n \nD. Notwithstanding any other law, a law enforcement agency may securely \ntransport an alien who the agency has received verification is unlawfully \npresent in the United States and who is in the agency's custody to a federal \n                                                           \n1  Although this opinion is designated ‘informal’; the analysis contained herein has the same \npersuasive weight as the analysis in a formal Attorney General opinion.” \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297-1   Filed 09/15/16   Page 3 of 8\n \nfacility in this state or to any other point of transfer into federal custody that \nis outside the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency. A law enforcement \nagency shall obtain judicial authorization before securely transporting an \nalien who is unlawfully present in the United States to a point of transfer that \nis outside of this state. \n \nII.  Policy \n \nLaw enforcement officers shall conduct contacts with individuals suspected of being unlawfully \npresent in the United States in a manner consistent with federal and state laws.  See A.R.S. § 11-\n1051(L). Officers shall protect the civil rights, privileges, and immunities of all persons. Officers \nshall not prolong a stop, detention, or arrest solely for the purpose of verifying immigration \nstatus.  Arizona, 132 S.Ct. at 2509 (“Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration \nstatus would raise constitutional concerns.”) If an officer deviates from this policy, the officer \nmust notify a supervisor at the first reasonable opportunity. Officers shall not contact, stop, \ndetain, or arrest an individual based on race, color, or national origin, except when it is part of a \nsuspect description linking that individual to a particular unlawful incident and said description \nis timely, reliable, and geographically relevant or when otherwise authorized by law.  See A.R.S. \n§ 11-1051(B).  \n \nIII.  Definitions \n \nThe following definitions will apply to the terms below as discussed in this informal \nopinion: \n \nAlien: Any individual not a citizen or national of the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3). \n \nCivil immigration violation: A violation of a federal civil immigration law.  Offenses include, but \nare not limited to, unlawful presence of an alien in the United States; an alien whose visa has \nexpired and has not been renewed; or an alien who seeks or engages in unauthorized \nemployment. See, generally,8 U.S.C. §1227(a)(1)(B)-(C).2  \n \nCriminal immigration violation: A violation of a federal criminal immigration law. Offenses \ninclude, but are not limited to, violations of Title 8, U.S.C., §1324; Title 8, U.S.C. §1325(a); \nand Title 8, U.S.C. §1326.  \n \nDetermine: To ascertain or conclude, especially after observation or consideration. See \nDictionary.com, http://www.dictionary.com (15 Apr. 2016). Only the federal government \nmay determine immigration status. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2498 (“The Government of the \nUnited States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of \n                                                           \n2 State law enforcement officers generally lack authority to detain individuals for civil violations \nof immigration law.  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506 (“Federal law specifies limited circumstances in \nwhich state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297-1   Filed 09/15/16   Page 4 of 8\n \naliens.”); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 225 (1982) (“The States enjoy no power with \nrespect to the classification of aliens.”). \n \nICE/CBP: Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Customs and Border Protection. \n \nImmigration status: The legal standing of an alien’s presence in the United States. \n \nProbable cause: Reliable information based on facts and circumstances sufficient to lead to \nthe conclusion that it is more likely than not that a crime has been committed and that the \nindividual to be arrested has committed it.  See, e.g., Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, \n(2003) (“The substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for \nbelief of guilt.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) \n \nReasonable suspicion: Specific facts which taken together with rational inferences from those \nfacts support an objective belief that an individual has committed or is about to commit an \noffense; based upon the facts that exist, there is reason to investigate further. An officer may \nstop or briefly detain an individual for further investigation based on reasonable suspicion (a \nTerry stop), but may not arrest on that basis alone.  See Terry v. Ohio, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968). \n \nUnlawfully present: For the purpose of applying § 2(B) and 2(D) of S.B. 1070, officers may \nconsider an alien “unlawfully present” only if the alien is NOT: (1) a lawful or conditional \npermanent resident; (2) a nonimmigrant in an authorized period of stay; (3) a refugee or asylee; \nor (4) otherwise authorized or allowed to remain in the United States by federal law or the \nfederal Department of Homeland Security.3    \nVerify:  To  prove  to  be  true;  confirm;  substantiate.  Dictionary.com, \nhttp://www.dictionary.com (15 Apr. 2016).    \n \nIV.  Consensual Contacts \n \nState laws related to immigration enforcement neither expand nor limit an officer’s \nability to approach an individual and engage in a consensual contact. During a consensual \ncontact, the officer may inquire about any subject matter.  However, the individual contacted \ndoes not have to answer questions or produce any identification, but may choose to do so \nvoluntarily. See, e.g., Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983). During a consensual \ncontact, officers may ask, but shall not demand, that an individual produce immigration \ndocuments. \n \nV.  Individuals Lawfully Stopped or Detained \n \nOfficers shall not prolong a stop or detention for an immigration inquiry to request or \nobtain verification of immigration status, or prolong a criminal investigation or inquiry in \n                                                           \n3 This definition is for purposes of this policy alone. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297-1   Filed 09/15/16   Page 5 of 8\n \norder to accommodate or complete immigration-related tasks.  Arizona, 132 S.Ct.at 2509; see \nalso Rodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1614-16.   \n \nAn officer shall presume that a person is lawfully present in the United States if the \nperson provides any of the following: a valid Arizona driver license or non-operating \nidentification license; a valid tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal identification; or \nany valid United States federal, state or local government issued identification, provided the \nissuing entity requires proof of legal presence in the United States.  A.R.S. § 11-1051(B)(1)-\n(4). \n \nIf in the course of duty an officer has reasonable suspicion that an individual is \nunlawfully present in the United States, based on all available facts, except race or ethnicity, \nthe officer shall attempt to verify the individual’s immigration status by contacting ICE/CBP \nunless doing so would prolong the stop or detention, or the circumstances below apply. The \nofficer shall, consistent with department policies, document the verification attempt, including \nthe basis for the officer’s reasonable suspicion as to unlawful presence and any response from \nICE/CBP, in the stop data collection system.4 \n \nIf  it  is  not  practicable for  an  officer  to  investigate or  verify  an  individual’s \nimmigration status due to factors such as call load, staffing, emergencies, other present \nduties, availability of personnel on scene, location, available back-up, ability to contact \nICE/CBP, or the availability of ICE/CBP, the officer may, consistent with department \npolicies, use discretion not to pursue an investigation into the individual’s immigration status, \nbut shall document the justification for such a decision in the stop data collection system. \n \nIf an officer has reasonable suspicion that an individual is unlawfully present, but \nbelieves that investigating or verifying immigration status may hinder or obstruct an \ninvestigation, the officer may, consistent with department policies, use discretion not to  \ninquire into the individual’s immigration status.  A.R.S. § 11-1051(B).  The officer shall, \nconsistent with department policies, document the justification for such a decision in the stop \ndata collection system. Factors to consider that may indicate an immigration inquiry could \nhinder or obstruct an investigation may include the need for suspect, victim, and witness \ncooperation in any investigation. \n \nVI.  Immigration Violations \n \nIf an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed a civil \nimmigration violation, the officer has no authority to arrest the individual and shall not \n                                                           \n4  “In January 2003, the Arizona Department of Public Safety began voluntarily collecting data \nregarding traffic and pedestrian stops, including information pertaining to the characteristics of \nthe traffic stop, driver, vehicle and officer(s).”  \nSee http://www.azdps.gov/about/reports/docs/Traffic_Stop_Response_2008.pdf (last visited Sep. \n13, 2016) \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297-1   Filed 09/15/16   Page 6 of 8\n \ndetain the individual longer than necessary to complete the state law basis for the contact.5 \nSee Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1001 (any extension of a lawful stop “must be supported by \nadditional suspicion of criminality. Unlawful presence is not criminal.”).   \n \nIf an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed a federal \ncriminal immigration violation, the officer may arrest the individual and contact ICE/CBP to \nclarify its interest in detaining the individual.6  See Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1001 (citing \nGonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 475 (9th Cir. 1983), for the proposition that \n“‘federal law does not preclude local law enforcement of the criminal provisions’ of federal \nimmigration law.”). Officers may wait a reasonable time period for ICE/CBP response and \nshould document any response or direction from ICE/CBP.  If ICE/CBP fails to respond or \ntake disposition within a reasonable amount of time and there is no other criminal violation, \nthe officer shall release the individual. \n \nIf ICE/CBP  agrees to take disposition of the individual, officers may assist by \ntransporting the individual to an ICE/CBP facility if ICE/CBP so directs. A.R.S. § 11-\n1051(D). When making the determination to transport, officers shall, consistent with \ndepartment policies, consider department and division priorities. \n \nOfficers shall not arrest an individual simply because the individual lacks proper \ndocumentation.  See Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1000-01.  \n \nVII.  Arrests \n \nAn officer or jail official shall not prolong an arrest or detention for an immigration \ninquiry, including to request or obtain verification of immigration status.  Arizona, 132 S.Ct. \nat 2509 (“Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise \nconstitutional concerns.”). \n \nIf, after reviewing all available facts (except race or ethnicity) and/or evidence, an \nofficer has reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is unlawfully present in the United States, a \nreasonable attempt shall be made to contact ICE/CBP to verify the arrestee’s immigration \nstatus prior to releasing the arrestee, but release may not be delayed in order to request or \nobtain verification.  Id. The presumptions and the exceptions in section V above apply to this \nparagraph. Officers shall, consistent with department policies, document any response or \ndirection from ICE/CBP in the stop data collection system. \n \nThe officer shall proceed to handle the arrestee according to department policy, \n                                                           \n5 This restriction on non-federal law enforcement does not apply where such officials have been \nspecifically trained and delegated to exercise the authority of an immigration officer under § \n287(g) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g), and are acting pursuant to that authority.  Melendres, 695 \nF.3d at 1001.  \n   \n6 It remains an open issue whether reasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigration \ncrime would be a basis for prolonging a detention.  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2509. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297-1   Filed 09/15/16   Page 7 of 8\n \nwhich may result in the issuance of a citation, referral, and the release of the arrestee. \n \nVIII.  Contact with ICE/CBP \n \nOfficers attempting to verify an individual’s immigration status shall do so by \ncontacting Operational Communications.  Operational Communications shall submit an \ninquiry through the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) for \nverification of an individual’s immigration status.  After a response is received from \nICE/CBP, Operational Communications shall forward the information to the officer.  If \ninformation verifying an individual’s immigration status is received from another source \n(such as an ICE/CBP officer on scene), the verification shall, consistent with department \npolicies, be documented in the stop data collection system. \n \nIf an officer wishes to request verification prior to the release of an individual or \narrestee, Operational Communications may follow the NLETS submission with a phone call \nto the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC).7 As explained above, however, officers \nmay not extend a stop or detention in order to make a verification request or to wait for a \nverification response. \n   \nIX.  Consular Notification \n \nOfficers should follow consular notification procedures set forth in the Vienna \nConvention  on  Consular  Relations  (the  Convention),  see  Article  30  of  the  Vienna \nConvention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U.S.T. 77, 100-101, T.I.A.S. \nNo. 6820, namely, “when a national of one country is detained by authorities in another, the \nauthorities must notify the consular officers of the detainee’s home country if the detainee so \nrequests.” Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 339 (2006) (“[Article 36 of the \nConvention] provides that ‘if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State \nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular \ndistrict, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial \nor is detained in any other manner.’”). Law enforcement officials may refer to the following \nfor guidance on such notification procedures:  Law Bulletin 2009-05, Foreign Nationals—\nAdvice of Rights in Addition to Miranda Warnings; the U.S. Department of State’s Consular \nNotification  and  Access  Manual,  (Fourth  ed.  2016), \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/dam/travel/CNAtrainingresources/CNA_Manual_4th_Edition\n_August2016.pdf (last visited September 13, 2016. 8   \n                                                           \n7 “ICE’s LESC operates ‘24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year’ and provides, \namong other things, ‘immigration status, identity information and real-time assistance to local, \nstate and federal law enforcement agencies.’”  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2508 (internal citations \nomitted).   \n8 This informal opinion does not confer upon aliens any legal rights beyond those recognized by binding \ncourt precedent.  See Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S. Ct . at  2681 (“Indeed, Article 36 [of Vienna \nConvention on Consular Relations] does not guarantee defendants any assistance at all. The \nprovision secures only a right of foreign nationals to have their consulate informed of their arrest \nor detention—not to have their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement authorities cease \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1297-1   Filed 09/15/16   Page 8 of 8\n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \ntheir investigation pending any such notice or intervention.”).  \n7 \n ",

Whiting, et al.,  )\n13 )\nDefendants.  )\n14 )\n)\n15\n16\n17 The Court now resolves Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction of A.R.S. § 13-\n18 2928(A) and (B) (“2d PI Mot.”) (Doc. 457). \n19 I. BACKGROUND\n20 The facts of this case were set forth in this Court’s Order of October 8, 2010 (“the\n21 Order”), which is incorporated fully herein. (See Doc. 447, Order at 1-4.) The pertinent\n22 details are briefly summarized here. Plaintiffs bring a variety of challenges to Ariz ona’s\n23 Senate Bill 1070 (“S.B. 1070”), the “Support Our Law Enforceemnt and Safe Neighborhoods\n24 Act,” which was signed into law by Governor Brewer on April 23, 2010. S.B. 1070 had an\n25 effective date of July 29, 2010; on July 28, 2010, the Court preliminarily enjoined certain\n26 provisions of the law from taking effect, in the related caseU  nited States v. Arizona, CV 10-\n27 1413-PHX-SRB. \n28 Plaintiffs in this case also m oved for a preliminary injunction as to a num ber of\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 487    Filed 05/10/11   Page 2 of 3\n1 provisions of the law. (See Doc. 235, Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.) At oral argument on the first\n2 Motion for Preliminary Injunction, counsel for Plaintiffs withdrew the ir request for an\n3 injunction running to Arizona Revised Statutes (“A.R.S.”) § 13-2928(A) and (B), created by\n4 S.B. 1070. (Order at 35.) In the October 8, 2010, Order, the Court ruled that Plaintiffs’ first\n5 Motion for Preliminary Injunction was moot in light of the injunction entered in  United\n6 States v. Arizona. (Id. at 34-35.) The Court also found that Plaintiffs had stated a claim with\n7 regard to their challenge to A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) on First Amendment grounds. (Id.\n8 at 19-20.) Plaintiffs now renew their Motion for preliminary injunctive relief as to A.R.S. §\n9 13-2928(A) and (B). (2d PI Mot. at 2.)\n10 II. LEGAL STANDARDS AND ANALYSIS\n11 Plaintiffs seek to preliminarily enjoin A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B), a request they\n12 withdrew at oral argument on their first Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (See Order at 35.)\n13 “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on\n14 the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that\n15 the balance of equities tips in his favor, and  that an injunction is  in the public interest.”\n16 Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008) (citations omitted). \n17 Plaintiffs withdrew their earlier Motion for preliminary injunctive relief as to these\n18 two provisions on the basis that a finding that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits\n19 of this claim was foreclosed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’s decision in Comite de\n20 Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach , 607 F.3d 1178 (9th Cir. 2010).\n21 (Order at 35.) The Redondo Beach court held that a local ordinance that banned standing on\n22 a street or highway and soliciting employment, business, or contributions from the occupant\n23 of a motor vehicle was a valid, content neutral restriction. 607 F.3d at 1184-93.\n24 Plaintiffs now argue that the Court should consider their Motion to enjoin A.R.S. §\n25 13-2829(A) and (B) because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc\n26 and ordered the opinion of the three-judge panel not citable. (2d PI Mot. at 2.) The en banc\n27 court heard oral argument on Redondo Beach on March 21, 2011, according to the Ninth\n28 Circuit  Court of Appeals’s website.  See  Status  of Pending En Banc Cases,\n- 2 -\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 487    Filed 05/10/11   Page 3 of 3\n1 http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/enbanc/ (last visited May 9, 2011). No opinion has yet been\n2 issued. Id. The Court concludes that it would not be an efficient use of resources to rule on\n3 Plaintiffs’ Motion at this tim e because the outcome will be at least im pacted, if not\n4 determined, by the ruling of the en banc court in  Redondo Beach. The mere fact that the\n5 Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc does not, on its own, create a likelihood of\n6 success on the merits of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge to A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and\n7 (B).1 Furthermore, it would not be in the public  interest for the Court to expend tim e and\n8 resources ruling on the second Motion for Preliminary Injunction now, only to be faced with\n9 a binding opinion from the Court of Appeals onR edondo Beach in the near future. The Court\n10 therefore declines to consider Plaintiffs’ second Motion for Prelim inary Injunction as to\n11 A.R.S. § 13-2928(A) and (B) at this time. \n12 IT IS ORDERED denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction of A.R.S.\n13 § 13-2928(A) and (B) (Doc. 457) without prejudice to its refiling at a later time.\n14\n15 DATED this 10th day of May, 2011.\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26 1 The Court also notes that, while it may have determined that Plaintiffs stated a claim\nsufficient to survive a challenge under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), that does\n27\nnot necessarily lead to the conclusion that Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success as\n28 required for preliminary injunctive relief.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiffs seek certification of three classes of individuals who will be harmed by \n3  the implementation and enforcement of Arizona Senate Bill 1070 (“SB 1070”), a \n4  comprehensive state regulation of immigration expressly intended to “discourage and \n5  deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons \n6  unlawfully present in the United States.”  SB 1070, § 1. \n7  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek to certify the following classes of persons who will be \n8  harmed by SB 1070:   \n9  (a)  All persons who as a result of their race or national origin are or will be \n10  subject to stop, detention, arrest, or questioning about their immigration or \n11  nationality status or required to produce documentation of that status, \n12  pursuant to a provision of SB 1070 (“Class A”); \n13  (b)  All persons who are or will be deterred from soliciting work in a public \n14  forum and/or performing work as an employee or independent contractor by \n15  § 5 of SB 1070 (“Class B”); and \n16  (c)  All persons who are or will be deterred from living, associating, worshiping, \n17  or traveling with immigrants in Arizona because of a provision of SB 1070  \n18  (“Class C”). \n19  There can be no reasonable dispute that the proposed classes meet the standards for \n20  certification.  Plaintiffs seek only declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the \n21  implementation and enforcement of a statute that infringes upon the civil rights of \n22  thousands of individuals across the state of Arizona—precisely the kind of case for which \n23  Rule 23(b)(2) class treatment was designed and is warranted.  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d \n24  1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998) (“As the Advisory Committee Notes explain, 23(b)(2) was \n25  adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions.”).  Therefore, the Motion \n26  should be granted. \n27  II.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n28  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on May 17, 2010.  On June 4, 2010, Plaintiffs moved \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM. IN \n  - 1 - \nSUPPORT THEREOF 10-CV-1061 (SRB) \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 563   Filed 12/12/11   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  for a preliminary injunction barring the implementation of SB 1070 in its entirety.  On \n2  July 6, 2010, the federal government filed its own lawsuit challenging many of SB 1070’s \n3  provisions and moved for a preliminary injunction to bar its implementation.  On July 28, \n4  2010, the day before SB 1070 was scheduled to take effect, the Court issued a preliminary \n5  injunction in the case brought by the federal government, blocking the implementation of \n6  four provisions of SB 1070.  United States v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d 980 (D. Ariz. \n7  2010), aff’d, 641 F.3d 339 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n8  On June 18, 2010, various Defendants filed motions pursuant to Federal Rules of \n9  Civil Procedure 8, 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(6), seeking dismissal of all of Plaintiffs’ causes of \n10  action on standing and other grounds.  The Court resolved these motions in its Order dated \n11  October 8, 2010.  Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Mtn. to Dismiss and Prelim. \n12  Inj., Dkt. #447.  Therein, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ motions \n13  but allowed most of Plaintiffs’ claims to proceed.  The Court also denied Plaintiffs’ \n14  preliminary injunction motion as moot in light of the preliminary injunction issued in the \n15  related case brought by the federal government. \n16  In accordance with the schedule set by the Court on September 19, 2011, Plaintiffs \n17  commenced discovery on issues related to class certification.  Specifically, Plaintiffs \n18  propounded (1) requests for admission, requests for production of documents, and \n19  interrogatories to Intervenor-Defendants the State of Arizona and Governor Janice K. \n20  Brewer, see Notice of Service, Dkt. #515; (2) a subpoena for documents on non-party \n21  Arizona Peace Officer Standards & Training Board (“AZPOST”),1 see id.; and (3) notices \n22  of deposition to Governor Brewer and the person(s) most knowledgeable of the State of \n23  Arizona, see Notice of Service Dkt. #548.  The discovery sought information concerning, \n24  inter alia, the intent of the State of Arizona and Governor Brewer to enforce SB 1070 \n25  throughout the State of Arizona; the statewide nature and potential impact of SB 1070; the \n26 \n                                              \n27  1 AZPOST is a state-created entity responsible for creating training and standards for all \nlaw enforcement officers in Arizona.

IN \n  - 2 - \nSUPPORT THEREOF 10-CV-1061 (SRB) \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 563   Filed 12/12/11   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  scope of SB 1070 and the number of people it would affect; and whether the State and \n2  Governor would implement SB 1070 through a centralized, uniform scheme.  In their \n3  responses to the requests for admission, the State of Arizona and Governor Brewer \n4  admitted, inter alia, that prior to the issuance of the preliminary injunction in this case, \n5  Intervenor Defendants intended for state and local entities and officials to enforce all \n6  provisions of SB 1070 and the Governor took actions to ensure that SB 1070 would be \n7  faithfully executed.  (Declaration of Margaret G. Ziegler, Ex. A at pp. 2-3 and Ex. B at pp. \n8  2-3.)  Intervenor Defendants also admitted that if the injunction is lifted, all Arizona \n9  county sheriffs and attorneys would be required to enforce SB 1070.  (Id. at Ex. A, p. 4 \n10  and Ex. B, pp. 4-5.) \n11  Following meet and confer discussions regarding Plaintiffs’ discovery, Plaintiffs \n12  and Intervenor Defendants agreed to a Stipulation providing as follows:  “In connection \n13  with Plaintiffs’ forthcoming Motion for Class Certification, Intervenor Defendants \n14  stipulate that it is the intention of the State of Arizona that each provision of S.B. 1070 \n15  that is not enjoined will be implemented and enforced uniformly throughout the State of \n16  Arizona.”  Dkt. #552 ¶ 4.  The Court approved the Stipulation on December 7, 2011.  Dkt. \n17  #560.  \n18  III.  ARGUMENT \n19  Plaintiffs challenge SB 1070 on the grounds that it violates the Supremacy Clause \n20  and core civil rights and civil liberties secured by the United States Constitution, including \n21  the Fourth Amendment right to freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, the \n22  Fifth Amendment right to due process, the First Amendment right to free speech, and the \n23  Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.  Plaintiffs hereby \n24  seek certification of three classes of persons who, like the named Plaintiffs, will suffer \n25  harm as a direct result of the implementation of SB 1070.   \n26  SB 1070’s numerous provisions create a comprehensive state-law system of \n27  immigration regulation and enforcement that will:  (1) require Arizona law enforcement, \n28  including the county sheriff and county attorney Defendants, to investigate and determine \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM. IN \n  - 3 - \nSUPPORT THEREOF 10-CV-1061 (SRB) \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 563   Filed 12/12/11   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  which persons present in Arizona may remain in the United States; (2) erect a state \n2  immigration registration and punishment scheme by creating state crimes and criminal \n3  penalties relating to alien registration, immigration status, and work authorization; and (3) \n4  require police to arrest and detain individuals and transfer them to federal authorities \n5  based merely on a belief that they have violated federal civil immigration laws, when state \n6  and local officers are not competent to make such a determination or authorized to make it \n7  under federal law.  SB 1070 requires Arizona police officers and sheriffs, Arizona jails, \n8  and Arizona courts to detect, adjudge, punish, and facilitate the deportation of individuals \n9  who, in Arizona’s view, are not entitled to remain in the United States.  SB 1070 will \n10  require persons in the state to carry immigration registration documents under state law to \n11  avoid detention, arrest, and possible prosecution.  In addition, if implemented, SB 1070 \n12  will cause the investigation, detention, harassment, and arrest of numerous persons of \n13  color in Arizona because of their race or national origin (or perceived race or national \n14  origin), including members of Plaintiffs United Food and Commercial Workers, Border \n15  Action Network, Tonatierra, Service Employees International Union, Service Employees \n16  International Union Local 5, Muslim American Society, and Japanese American Citizens \n17  League, as well as Individual Plaintiffs C.M., Luz Santiago, Jim Shee, Jose Vargas, Jesús \n18  Cuauhtémoc Villa, John Doe #1, Jane Does #2-3, and members of the plaintiff classes. \n19  All named Defendants are responsible for the enforcement of SB 1070.  Intervenor \n20  Defendants State of Arizona and Governor Brewer are also responsible for the statewide \n21  implementation and enforcement of SB 1070.  The Intervenor Defendants have stipulated \n22  that, if the law is permitted to take effect, they intend to and will enforce each provision of \n23  the law uniformly statewide.  Dkt. #552 ¶ 4.   \n24  A.  PROPOSED CLASS DEFINITIONS \n25  Plaintiffs seek to represent themselves and all other persons similarly situated \n26  pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs propose the \n27  following three classes: \n28  (a)  All persons who as a result of their race or national origin are or will be \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

PLAINTIFFS’ PROPOSED CLASSES MEET THE LEGAL \nSTANDARD FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION UNDER RULE 23(a) \n12 \n13  In determining whether to certify a class, the Court must determine whether each \n14  proposed class meets the four requirements of Rule 23(a), which are:  (1) that the class is \n15  so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable (“numerosity”); (2) that there are \n16  questions of law or fact common to the class (“commonality”); (3) that the claims or \n17  defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class \n18  (“typicality”); and (4) that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \n19  interests of the class (“adequacy of representation”).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition, \n20  where, as here, the moving party seeks to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), the Court \n21  must determine whether  “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n22  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding  \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                              \n2   The individual Plaintiffs who represent Class A are Pedro Espinoza, C.M., Jim Shee, \n26 \nJose Angel Vargas, Maura Castillo, Maria Morales, John Doe #1, and Jane Doe #3. \n27 \n3   The individual Plaintiff who represents Class B is Jose Angel Vargas. \n28  4   The individual Plaintiff who represent Class C is Luz Santiago. \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

Cal. 1996)).   \n7  Each of the three proposed classes has substantially more than forty members.  SB \n8  1070 is a law of statewide application that would affect literally thousands of Arizonans if \n9  fully implemented.  In fact, the individual named Plaintiffs and the members of the \n10  organizational Plaintiffs alone are sufficiently numerous to meet the class action \n11  requirement for Class A.  For example, Plaintiff United Food and Commercial Workers \n12  International alone represents more than 21,000 workers in Arizona who would be subject \n13  to SB 1070.  (Declaration of Joseph Hansen, Dkt. #236-1, ¶ 3.)  Of those workers, many \n14  have varying degrees of English-language proficiency, represent many races and \n15  ethnicities, and many are Latinos, all of which make them more likely to be subject them \n16  to stops, detentions, arrests or questioning about their immigration or nationality status \n17  under SB 1070.  (Id. ¶¶ 4, 6.)  Similarly, Plaintiff Service Employers International Union \n18  represents approximately 2,300 workers in Arizona who would be subject to SB 1070.  \n19  (Declaration of Eliseo Medina, Dkt. #236-5, ¶ 5.)  An estimated 40 percent of those \n20  workers are Latinos and/or other racial minorities, which increases their chances of being \n21  subject to stops, detentions, arrest or questioning about their immigration status under SB \n22  1070 as members of Class A.  (Id. ¶¶ 5, 6.)   \n23  Taking into consideration Arizona’s current population and given the statewide \n24  reach of SB 1070 if it were implemented, the number of individuals aside from Plaintiffs \n25  who would be adversely affected by SB 1070 could reach into the hundreds of thousands.  \n26  According to the latest census figures, Arizona’s population is approximately 6,392,017 \n27  people and 14.7 percent of those individuals are foreign born.

(Pls.’ \n2  Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex. A.)  SB 1070 will particularly burden persons of \n3  Latino and/or Asian descent, who comprise 29.6 and 2.8 percent of the Arizona \n4  population respectively.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated in Class A are or will \n5  be subject to stop, detention, arrest or questioning about their immigration or nationality \n6  status or will be required to produce documentation of that status, pursuant to a provision \n7  of SB 1070, as a result of their race or national origin.  (See FAC ¶¶ 21, 22, 24-29, 149-\n8  63.)  Given the large number of individuals represented by Plaintiffs as well as others \n9  similarly situated in Arizona who are or appear to be foreign-born Latinos or Asians, the \n10  number of individuals adversely affected by the implementation of SB 1070 far exceeds \n11  forty, as does the number of persons who will be deterred from soliciting work in a public \n12  forum because of SB 1070.  (Declaration of Alison Harrington ¶¶ 7, 8.)  The number of \n13  individuals deterred from associating with immigrants also indisputably exceeds 40.  (See \n14  RJN Ex. A (14.7% of 6,392,017 Arizonans are foreign born).  These showings alone are \n15  more than sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) for each of the \n16  proposed classes.  \n17  Plaintiffs also satisfy the numerosity requirement because joinder is impracticable \n18  given the sheer number of Plaintiffs and class members.  See Harris v. Palm Springs \n19  Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 1964) (“‘impracticability’ does not \n20  mean ‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of \n21  the class”) (citation omitted).  Joinder of all potential class members is also impracticable \n22  because many of their identities are unknown to Plaintiffs.  See Ingram v. O’Bannon, 88 \n23  F.R.D. 653, 656 (E.D. Pa. 1980) (“The fact that a substantial number of class members are \n24  unidentified favors a finding of numerosity.”).  In addition, joinder is impracticable for \n25  logistical reasons.  Many of the class members would not have the resources to file \n26  individual lawsuits to seek redress of violations of their civil and constitutional rights as a \n27  result of implementation of SB 1070.  See Lynch v. Rank, 604 F. Supp. 30, 36 (N.D. Cal. \n28  1984), aff’d, 747 F.2d 528 (9th Cir. 1984), amended on reh’g, 763 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

Moreover, even if they had the logistical ability to bring suit, a number of \n4  the class members may not want to bring individual lawsuits to challenge the harms \n5  caused by implementation of SB 1070 for fear of retaliation.  See Mullen v. Treasure \n6  Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624-25 (5th Cir. 1999) (noting that the unwillingness of \n7  individuals to initiate or join a lawsuit for fear of retaliation supports class certification); \n8  Doe Plfs’ Mot. for Leave to Proceed Under Pseudonyms, Dkt. #3, at 14-15; Decl. of John \n9  Doe 1, Dkt. #3-3, ¶ 7.  In light of the racially charged and divisive atmosphere in Arizona \n10  surrounding SB 1070 and immigration issues, this is a significant factor for the Court to \n11  consider.  \n12 \n2.  The Proposed Classes Share Common Questions Of Law And \nFact  \n13 \n14  Each of the three proposed classes shares common questions of law or fact, as \n15  required by Rule 23(a)(2).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2); Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 \n16  U.S. 591, 613 (1997).  The commonality requirement does not impose a heavy burden.  \n17  Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Rule 23(a)(2) has been \n18  construed permissively.”); Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998) \n19  (same); Jordan v. Los Angeles County, 669 F.2d 1311, 1323 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated on \n20  other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1983) (commonality requirement has generally been given \n21  “a permissive application in a variety of substantive law areas so that the commonality \n22  requirement is usually found to be satisfied”).  Courts have typically construed the \n23  commonality requirement liberally in cases seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(2) \n24  because an injunction class generally challenges a policy or action affecting an \n25  identifiable group in the same manner. The Ninth Circuit has held that, under Rule \n26  23(b)(2), the commonality requirement is relaxed and “[i]t is sufficient if class members \n27  complain of a pattern or practice that is generally applicable to the class as a whole” such \n28  as when Rule 23(b)(2) is used as a “vehicle for challenging ‘a common policy.’”  Walters \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

Cal. 1999) (“When addressing commonality of class members \n3  proposed under Rule 23(b)(2), a court may employ a liberal definition of commonality.”).     \n4  The commonality requirement “can be met by raising a single common issue that is \n5  central to the case.”  Celano, 242 F.R.D. at 551 (citing Staton, 327 F.3d at 954-56); \n6  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1019 (commonality requirement is met either by common legal issues \n7  with divergent factual predicates or by common core of facts with disparate legal \n8  remedies); Krzesniak v. Cendant Corp., No. C 05-05156-MEJ, 2007 WL 1795703, at *7 \n9  (N.D. Cal. June 20, 2007) (“The existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual \n10  predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal \n11  remedies within the class.”).  Rule 23(a)(2) does not require that every question of law or \n12  fact be common to every member of the class.  Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1320; Arnold v. \n13  United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 F.R.D. 439, 448-49 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (“Nor must \n14  ‘all questions of law and fact involved in the dispute be common to all members of the \n15  class.’”) (citation omitted).     \n16  Plaintiffs easily meet the commonality requirement, as this action raises multiple \n17  questions of law that are common to members of each of the three putative classes. \n18  including:  (1) whether SB 1070 is preempted by the U.S. Constitution and federal law; \n19  (2) whether SB 1070 deprives racial and national origin minorities of the equal protection \n20  of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; (3) \n21  whether SB 1070 violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; (4) whether SB \n22  1070 violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 2, Section 8 of \n23  the Arizona Constitution; and (5) whether SB 1070 is impermissibly vague and violates \n24  due process of law for members of the proposed class.6   \n                                              \n25  6 Although only one common issue is necessary to certify a class, members of each class \nproposed here shares multiple common legal questions:  members of Class A share, inter \n26 \nalia, questions of preemption, equal protection, the Fourth Amendment, and vagueness in \n27  common; members of Class B share, inter alia, questions regarding preemption, equal \nprotection, and the First Amendment; and claims by members of Class C all involve, inter \n28 \nalia, questions of preemption and vagueness. \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

Thus, for example although members of Class \n3  A may differ in their citizenship or immigration statuses, these differences do not matter \n4  as the claims in this case challenge the Defendants’ violation of various constitutional \n5  safeguards which apply regardless of citizenship or immigration status.  See Walters, 145 \n6  F.3d at 1046 (differences among class members regarding merits of individual cases were \n7  “simply insufficient to defeat the propriety of class certification”); Doe v. Los Angeles \n8  Unified Sch. Dist., 48 F. Supp. 2d 1233, 1241 (C.D. Cal. 1999) (“[C]ommonality exists if \n9  plaintiffs share a common harm or violation of their rights, even if individualized facts \n10  supporting the alleged harm or violation diverge.”).  Similarly, because members of Class \n11  B assert claims under the same legal theories, the specific factual context in which each \n12  member may solicit and obtain employment is immaterial to the commonality analysis.  If \n13  Section 5 of SB 1070 is implemented, all members of Class B would, inter alia suffer \n14  unconstitutional restrictions of their constitutional free speech rights.  (See, e.g., FAC \n15  ¶¶ 99-109.) \n16 \n3.  The Claims of the Named Plaintiffs Are Typical Of The Proposed \n17  Classes \n18 \nThe named Plaintiffs’ claims are also typical of the proposed classes’ respective \n19 \nclaims, as required by Rule 23(a)(3).  “Under the rule’s permissive standards, \n20 \nrepresentative claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent \n21 \nclass members; they need not be substantially identical.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020; see \n22 \nalso Krzesniak, 2007 WL 1795703, at *9.  “While typicality and commonality ‘tend to \n23 \nmerge’ . . . . typicality focuses on whether the named plaintiffs possess the ‘same interest \n24 \nand suffer the same injury’ as class members.”  Krzesniak, 2007 WL 1795703, at *8 \n25 \n(citation omitted).  A finding of commonality will ordinarily support a finding of \n26 \ntypicality.  Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans’ Admin., 118 F.R.D. 113, 117 (N.D. Cal. 1987).   \n27 \nA claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct \n28 \nand is based on the same legal theory.  Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

Cal. 1985).  In this case, the named \n2  Plaintiffs and all the members of the proposed classes will be harmed by the \n3  implementation of SB 1070.  They have identical claims for declaratory and injunctive \n4  relief under common legal theories and identical interests in protecting their constitutional \n5  rights.  These identical claims for relief also arise from the same course of conduct by \n6  Defendants—potential enforcement of SB 1070—which Defendants have acknowledged \n7  will be enforced uniformly across the State of Arizona.  Dkt. #552 ¶ 4.7   \n8  Any potential differences in the reasons for the named Plaintiffs’ or class members’ \n9  arrests, detentions, or interrogations under SB 1070 are irrelevant for Rule 23(a)(3) \n10  purposes.  See Krzesniak, 2007 WL 1795703, at *8 (citing Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., \n11  976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992) (typicality inquiry goes to “the nature of the claim . . .  \n12  of the class representative, and not to the specific facts from which it arose”).  It is not \n13  necessary that “the named plaintiffs’ injuries be identical with those of the other class \n14  members, only that the unnamed class members have injuries similar to those of the \n15  named plaintiffs and that the injuries result from the same, injurious course of conduct.”  \n16  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d, 849, 869 (9th Cir. 2001).  Here, the named Plaintiffs as \n17  well as all of the proposed class members will suffer abuses and deprivation of rights due \n18  to the enforcement of SB 1070 by the Defendants.  Thus, the typicality requirement of \n19  Rule 23(a)(3) is met. \n20 \n                                              \n7 For example, individual Plaintiffs Pedro Espinoza and Jim Shee, amongst others, fear \n21 \nbeing stopped, detained, arrested or questioned because they appear to be of a minority \n22  racial group.  (FAC ¶¶ 21, 24.)  Their interests in preventing the implementation of SB \n1070 are the same as other members of Class A who would suffer the same abrogations of \n23 \ntheir equal protection and other rights because of such law enforcement action.  Individual \nPlaintiff Jose Angel Vargas fears arrest and prosecution for soliciting work in public \n24 \nplaces (id. ¶ 25), and shares common claims with Class B members who will have their \n25  First Amendment and other rights affected in the same way if SB 1070 is implemented.  If \nSB 1070 is implemented, individual Plaintiff Luz Santiago fears that she would be \n26 \nstopped and arrested under the harboring provisions of SB 1070 Section 5 for her work \n27  with members of her congregation, including those who are immigrants.  (Id. ¶ 23.)  \nMembers of Class C would have the same interests and claims under, inter alia, the \n28 \nFourth Amendment. \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

The Named Plaintiffs Fairly And Adequately Represent The \nProposed Classes \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs also meet the final requirement of Rule 23(a), as they will fairly and \n4  adequately represent the interests of all members of the proposed classes.  To satisfy the \n5  adequacy requirement, Plaintiffs must show (1) that their interests are common with, and \n6  not antagonistic to, the interests of the class; and (2) that they are able to prosecute the \n7  action vigorously through qualified and competent counsel.  Linney v. Cellular Alaska \n8  P’ship, 151 F.3d 1234, 1238-39 (9th Cir. 1998); Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., \n9  582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978).  As already set forth above, Plaintiffs seek relief on \n10  behalf of each of the classes as a whole, share a common interest in ensuring the \n11  protection of constitutional rights, and have no interests antagonistic to other members of \n12  the classes.   \n13  Plaintiffs will also be able to prosecute this matter vigorously.  Adequacy of \n14  counsel can be shown by establishing that counsel is qualified, experienced, and able to \n15  conduct litigation.  Jordan, 669 F.3d at 1323.

THE PROPOSED CLASSES SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF \nRULE 23(b)(2) \n2 \n3  In addition to satisfying the Rule 23(a) requirements, the proposed classes also \n4  satisfy Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or \n5  refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n6  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. \n7  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate “when a single injunction or \n8  declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.”  Wal-Mart \n9  Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, --- U.S. ----, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2557 (2011). \n10  As the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, “‘[c]ivil rights cases against parties \n11  charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples’ of what (b)(2) is \n12  meant to capture.”  Id. at 2557-58 (quoting Amchem Prods, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, \n13  614 (1997)).  “[T]he (b)(2) class ‘serves most frequently as the vehicle for civil rights \n14  actions and other institutional reform cases that receive class action treatment.’”  Barnes \n15  v. American Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 142 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Baby Neal v. Casey, \n16  43 F.3d 48, 58-59 (3d Cir. 1994)).  “Indeed, (b)(2) was ‘designed specifically for civil \n17  rights cases seeking broad declaratory or injunctive relief for a numerous and often \n18  unascertainable or amorphous class of persons.’”  Id. (quoting 2 Newberg on Class \n19  Actions § 4:11 (4th ed.)). \n20  The proposed classes satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) for multiple reasons.  First, this suit \n21  seeks to vindicate civil rights through injunctive and declaratory relief—precisely the type \n22  of action for which Rule 23(b)(2) was designed.  See Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2557; see also \n23  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047 (“As the Advisory Committee Notes explain, 23(b)(2) was \n24  adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions.”); 2 Newberg on Class \n25  Actions § 4:11 (4th ed.); cf. Doe v. Prosecutor, Marion County, Ind., 566 F. Supp. 2d 862, \n26  867 (S.D. Ind. 2008) (parties stipulated to Rule 23(b)(2) class of sex- and violent-\n27  offenders in pre-enforcement declaratory judgment and injunctive relief action against \n28  amendments to Indiana’s sex offender registration laws). \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM. IN \n  - 14 - \nSUPPORT THEREOF 10-CV-1061 (SRB) \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 563   Filed 12/12/11   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  Second, Plaintiffs assert that they face an imminent threat of harm if SB 1070 is \n2  enforced because SB 1070 violates the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and state law.  \n3  (First Am. Compl. §§ 166, 171).  Specifically, if SB 1070 is not enjoined, it will require \n4  persons in the state to carry immigration registration documents to avoid detention, arrest, \n5  and possible prosecution, and will trigger the investigation, detention, harassment, and \n6  arrest of numerous persons of color in Arizona.  (Id. § 172.)  As Intervenor Defendants the \n7  State of Arizona and Governor Brewer have admitted, prior to the issuance of the \n8  preliminary injunction Intervenor Defendants intended for state and local entities and \n9  officials to enforce all provisions of S.B. 1070 and the Governor took actions to ensure \n10  that the law would be faithfully executed.  (Ziegler Decl. Ex. A at pp. 2-3 and Ex. B at pp. \n11  2-3.)  Furthermore, Intervenor Defendants stipulated that “it is the intention of the State of \n12  Arizona that each provision of S.B. 1070 that is not enjoined will be implemented and \n13  enforced uniformly throughout the State of Arizona.”  Dkt. #552 ¶ 4 (emphases added).  \n14  Intervenor Defendants also admitted that if the injunction is lifted, all Arizona county \n15  sheriffs and attorneys would enforce S.B. 1070 and the Governor would faithfully execute \n16  the law.  (Ziegler Decl. Ex. A at pp. 4-5 and Ex. B at pp. 4-5.)  The State of Arizona and \n17  Governor Brewer thus effectively admit that they will act on grounds that will apply \n18  generally to each class as a whole.   \n19  Third, courts regularly certify 23(b)(2) classes to bring such constitutional \n20  challenges against state and local laws.  See, e. g., Lewis ex rel. Young v. Alexander, — \n21  F.R.D. —, No. 06-3963, 2011 WL 3678721 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 22, 2011) (certifying (b)(2) \n22  class bringing facial challenge to Pennsylvania’s Medicaid statute as conflicting with \n23  federal Medicaid Act and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief barring enforcement of \n24  the statute against the class); Smiley v. Calumet City, Ill., No. 08C3017, 2009 WL \n25  1381034 (N.D. Ill. May 15, 2009) (certifying (b)(2) class in case challenging \n26  constitutionality of municipal ordinance because “the interests of each of the class \n27  members are cohesive and a decision on whether [the ordinance] is facially \n28  unconstitutional will affect all persons that are similarly situated”); Torres v. New York \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM. IN \n  - 15 - \nSUPPORT THEREOF 10-CV-1061 (SRB) \n \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 563   Filed 12/12/11   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  State Dept. of Labor, 318 F. Supp. 1313 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) (certifying (b)(2) class in civil \n2  rights action seeking declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality of New York Labor \n3  Law); Sullivan v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 307 F. Supp. 1328 (S.D. Tex. 1969) \n4  (certification of (b)(2) class in suit challenging constitutionality of school district \n5  regulations); see also Advisory Committee’s Note, 39 F.R.D. 69, 102 (1966) (“Action or \n6  inaction is directed to a class within the meaning of this subdivision even if it has taken \n7  effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members of the class, provided it is based on \n8  grounds which have general application to the class.”) (emphasis added).   \n9  Fourth, Plaintiffs are not seeking monetary damages—only declaratory and \n10  injunctive relief.  Therefore, “a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide \n11  relief to each member of [each] class.”  Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. \n12  Finally, Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate because class treatment will \n13  avoid any potential risk of mootness as the action progresses.  Courts regularly consider \n14  potential mootness as a factor favoring certification of Rule 23(b)(2) classes.8  See Ollier \n15  v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 251 F.R.D. 564, 566 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (certifying \n16  class of students and noting, because plaintiff students might graduate or move, that \n17  “mootness is an important and real concern”); McMillon, 261 F.R.D. at 547-48 (“class \n18  certification is needed because it will prevent Plaintiffs’ claims from becoming moot”); \n19  Waters v. Barry, 711 F. Supp. 1125, 1130 n.10 (D.D.C. 1989) (in challenge to curfew law \n20  court determined that Rule 23(b)(2) requirements were satisfied where plaintiff sought \n21  class certification “to avoid a potential mootness problem as the matter progresses”).  \n22  Here, certain named Plaintiffs have immigration statuses that may or will change during \n23 \n                                              \n24  8   The Rule 23(b)(2) requirements would be fully satisfied here for the other reasons \nexplained above — because this is a civil rights matter of solely declaratory and injunctive \n25 \nrelief to address a law generally applying to the entire class.  Plaintiff need show nothing \n26  more to meet the 23(b)(2) requirements, but raise the mootness issue because it is a factor \nthat courts have considered in certifying Rule 23(b)(2) classes.  E.g., McMillon v. Hawaii, \n27 \n261 F.R.D. 536, 547-48 (D. Haw. 2009) (noting that there is no “needs” showing required \nin addition to the 23(b)(2) requirements, but finding that potential mootness made class \n28 \ncertification necessary). \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERT. &  MEM.

(FAC \n2  ¶¶ 21 (Plaintiff Espinoza currently in deportation proceedings), 29 (Plaintiff Jane Doe \n3  #3’s U-Visa application currently pending).  Absent class certification, Plaintiffs could be \n4  required to repeatedly amend their complaint to substitute in new representative plaintiffs, \n5  leading to serial motions to amend and, subsequently, serial answers by each of the \n6  Defendants.  For this additional reason, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is \n7  appropriate here. \n8  IV.  CONCLUSION \n9  For all of the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs satisfy each of the requirements of \n10  Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \n11  certify this case as a class action and appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel.  \n \n12 \nDated:    December 12, 2011    /s/  Nora Preciado                    \n13 \nNATIONAL IMMIGRATION LAW CENTER \n14 \n    /s/ Omar C.

After numerous unsuccessful effo rts to address those problems (includi ng \nthrough the enforcement of existing laws),  the Arizona Legislature enacted Ariz. \nRev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B)  to regulate such solicitation, but  only when \nit  is conducted in a manner that  blocks  or impedes the normal movement of \ntraffic.    With  or without A riz.  Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B), it i s \nundisputed that persons cannot sol icit employment in Arizona in a manner that \nblocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs moved \nfor a preliminary injunction of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B), arguing \nthat Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A)  and (B) violate their First Amend ment \nrights by prohibiting them from soliciting employment in an illegal manner.   This \nis a facial challenge with no as-applied allegations.   \nThe only evidence Plaintiffs presented to support their extraordinary request \nfor preliminary injunctive relief was the a ssertion that the threat of prosecution  \nunder Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B) was deterring persons in Arizona \nfrom soliciting employment.  Plaintiffs ma ke this claim even though the statute \nexpressly applies only to in-street solicitation that impedes traffic.   \nArizona, by contrast, presented evidence that:  \n  - 1 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 9 of 49\n \n(1) in-street employment solicitation has been causing problems in Arizona \nfor years;  \n(2)  in-street em ployment  solicitation  causes  significant traffic safety \nconcerns;  \n(3)  the secondary effects of in-street em ployment  solicitation include \nincreased crime, property damage, economic harms, and aesthetic concerns;  \n(4) in-street employment solicitation causes significantly greater harm than \nother forms of solicitation;  \n(5)  Arizona co mmunities  have made  numerous,  unsuccessful  attempts to \naddress these problems;  \n(6) existing laws have been and will cont inue to be ineffective in addressing \nthese problems; and  \n(7) the legislative history demonstrates that the Arizona Legislature enacted \nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B)  to address the traffic safety concerns \nand secondary effects of in-street employment solicitation. \nNotwithstanding Arizona’s unrefuted evidence of a content-neutral purpose \nfor enacting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-29 28(A) and (B) and the ineffectiveness of \nthe available alternatives, the district co urt found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n2928(A) and (B) are likely unconstit utional under the Central Hudson test.  In \nreaching this conclusion, the district cour t first found that Plaintiffs have a Firs t \n  - 2 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 10 of 49\n \nAmendment right to solicit employment in a manner  that blocks or impedes the \nnormal movement of traffic.  The distri ct court then found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. \nAnn. § 13-2928(A) and (B) are content based and, therefore, subject to “heightened \nscrutiny,” relying solely on its ruling at the motion-to-dismiss stage and without \naddressing  any of the eviden ce  Arizona  presented regarding the provisi ons’ \ncontent-neutral purpose.  The district court then found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n13-2928(A) and (B) fail the final prong of the  Central Hudson test (again without \naddressing  any of the evidence Arizona  presented)  based on its fi ndings  that \nArizona  has existing traffic laws to addr ess  its traffic concerns and   that the \nprovisions at issue were supposedly enacted to suppress day-labor speech.   \nThe district court’s findings are not supported by the evidence and cannot be \nsustained under the controlling precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Ninth \nCircuit.  The district court’s prelim inary injunction of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n2928(A) and (B) should be vacated. \n   \n  - 3 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 11 of 49\n \nStatement of Jurisdiction \n1\nOn  May 17, 2010,   fourteen Organizational  Plaintiffs   and ten Individual \n2\nPlaintiffs  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) commenced this action against each of the \nCounty Attorneys and County Sheriffs in Arizona, in their official capacities.  ER \n594.  Arizona and Governor Brewer obtained leave to intervene on June 18, 2010.   \nER 615.  The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345.  On \nFebruary 29, 2012, the district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the \nportions of S.B. 1070, as amended by H.B. 2162 (“S.B. 1070”), which are codified \nat Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B) (“Sections 5(A) and (B)”).  ER 1-13.  \nArizona filed its prelim inary injunction appeal on March 28, 2012.  ER 14-24.     \nThis appeal is timely under Fed. R.

ER 617.  That same m onth, the Ninth \nCircuit held that Redondo Beach Municipal Code § 3-7.1601 (the “Redondo Beach \nOrdinance”), which imposes broad restrictions on roadside solicitations, was “a \nvalid time, place, or manner restric tion” under the First Am endment.  See Comite \nde Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach , 607 F.3d 1178, 1180 \n  - 5 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 13 of 49\n \n(9th  Cir. 2010) (“ Redondo  Beach  I”).   Bas ed  on  Redondo  Beach I ,  Plaintiffs \nwithdrew their request for a preliminary injunction of Sections 5(A) and (B).  E R \n590. \nAfter the Ninth Circuit granted a petition for rehearing  en banc of Redondo \nBeach I, see Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo  Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, \n623 F.3d 1054 (9th Cir.  2010), Plaintiffs renewed their request for a prelim inary \ninjunction of Sections 5(A) and (B) (“Pl aintiffs’ Second Motion”).  ER 494-555.   \nAfter full briefing, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Second Motion without addressing \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ motion and without prejudice to Plaintiffs re asserting the \nmotion  after the  en  banc  panel ruled on the Redondo Beach Ordinance’s \nconstitutionality.  ER 214. \nOn  September  16, 2011, this Cour t  struck down the Redondo Beach \nOrdinance under the time, place, or manner test because it found that the ordinance \n“was not narrowly tailored to achieve the City’s goals.”   Comite de Jornaleros de \nRedondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936, 951 (9t h Cir. 2011) (en \nbanc) (“Redondo Beach II”).  Plaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction of \nSections 5(A) and (B) a third time, relying alm ost exclusively on Redondo Beach \nII.  ER 108-211 (“Plaintiffs’ Third Motion”).   \nThe  district court rejected   Plaintiffs’ argument that  Redondo  Beach II  \ncontrolled  the constitutionality of Secti ons  5(A) and (B) because, unlike the \n  - 6 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 14 of 49\n \nRedondo  Beach Ordinance, Sections 5( A)  and (B) regulate only commercial  \nspeech.  ER 5 n.2.  The district court nevertheless found that Sections 5(A) and (B) \nare likely unconstitutional regulations on  commercial speech because Arizona’s  \nexisting  traffic laws shoul d  be sufficien t  to address Arizona’s traffic safety \nconcerns and because Sections 5(A) and (B ) had been inserted into a bill that \nincluded  several provisions   designed to discourage  illegal  immigration and,  \ntherefore, were not “drawn to achieve” Arizona’s asserted interest in traffic safety.  \nThe district court granted the m otion on February 29, 2012 and entered an orde r \npreliminarily  enjoining the enforcem ent  of  Sections 5(A) and (B).  ER 1-13. \nArizona filed this preliminary injunction appeal on March 28, 2012.  ER 14-24. \nStatement of Facts \nA.  In-Street Employment Solicitation Threatens Public Safety \nIn-street solicitation of employment poses a substantial and unique threat to \npublic safety.  A physical interference with  moving traffic—by either a pedestrian \nor a stopped vehicle—creates an obvious sa fety hazard.  ER 95 (traffic engineer \nDan Cleavenger stating that an  intersection in Mesa “had a couple of crashes that  \nappear to be related to the  day labor folks”).  That hazar d is particularly acute in \nthe context of employment solicitation becau se prospective day laborers generally \ncongregate by the roadside in l arge groups, flag down vehicles as they approach, \nand often swarm vehicles that stop.  ER  326, 363, 363.  Such conduct “creates a \n  - 7 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 15 of 49\n \ndangerous  situation for t he  pedestrian  near  the roadway,  for  the m otorist \ninteracting with the pedestrian, and  for other motorists nearby.”  ER 322; see also \nER 326 (stating that the situation is particularly dangerous because “day laborers \ntypically wait on the side of busy roads,  at busy intersections, and at the entrance \nof major businesses that attract lots of customers”); ER 411 (reflecting statements \nby business managers near a popular day labor site that “[t]hey’ve seen a few job-\n3\nseekers get injured by cars stopping abruptly”).   Also, unlike a simple solicitation \nfor monetary donations, day laborers and prospective employers must discuss the \nnature, duration, and location of the work  to be perform ed and negotiate wages \n(oftentimes while dealing with language ba rriers), and then the day laborer m ust \nenter the vehicle to be transported to another location.  ER 323-24. \nRoadside  solicitation of em ployment  also  results in increased cri minal \nactivities.  ER 328-29, 343-44, 363.  According to a Department of Justice report: \n(1) “[s]imple and aggravated assaults ma y take place at d ay laborer sites”; (2) \n“[l]aborers may be routinely robbed”; (3) “[l]aborers  may drink and sell or use \n                                           \n3\n  See  also ACORN v. City of Phoenix ,  798 F.2d 1260, 1270  (9th  Cir. 1986),  \noverruled in part on other grounds by  Redondo Beach II, 657 F.3d 936 (9t h Cir. \n2011) (finding that “solicitati on from motorists creates a potentia l safety hazard \nbecause  the consequent distraction of  the  drivers poses a significant risk to \nmotorist and pedestrian safety”).  Traffic safety in general, and pedestrian safety in \nparticular, are significant concerns for Arizona.  Arizona has one of the highest per \ncapita pedestrian fatality rates of any state  in the nation.  ER 413.  In 2009, m otor \nvehicle accidents injured over 138 peopl e and killed more than two p eople each \nday.  ER 427.  These accidents also cost the State $2.757 billion.  Id. \n  - 8 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 16 of 49\n \nillicit drugs in public”; and (4) “[l]aborers may vandalize area property or deface \nproperty with graffiti.”  ER  363.  “Laborers often leav e discarded bottles, food \nwrappers, and other litter at day laborer s ites” and “[l]aborers waiting all day for \nwork may urinate in public.”  Id.   \nThese problems exist in numerous Arizona cities, including Phoenix, Cave  \nCreek, Chandler, Mesa, and Fountain Hi lls, causing business owners to complain \nto local officials about the harm  day laborers have caused to their revenues.  ER \n95,  97, 99-100, 102, 328-30, 343-44,   410-11,  482-83, 485-86, 490-91.  In \nparticular,  business owners and offici als  have observed assa ults,  trespassing, \nloitering, sexual harassment, theft, and pr operty destruction.  ER 328-30, 343-44.    \nOne local business owner even received death threats from day laborers.  ER 343.   \nB.  There Are No Readily Available Effective Alternatives to Address \nthe Safety Concerns and Economic and Environmental Harms In-\nStreet Employment Solicitation Causes  \nLocal communities and business owners have spent years exploring options \nto  address the secondary effects of  in-street  employment  solicitation without  \nsuccess.  For example, the City of Mesa  tried increasing its enforcement of other \nlaws.  ER 483.  The City of Cave Cree k pushed for a crackdown on loitering laws.  \nER 97.  The City of Chandler enacted a parking ban.  ER 99.  And business owners \n  - 9 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 17 of 49\n \nin the City of Phoenix have  hired off-duty pol ice officers to patrol outsi de their \n4\nbusinesses.  ER 330, 343.    \nArizona’s existing traffic laws do not adequately address the safety concerns \narising out of in-street employment solicita tion because such laws are t oo narrow \nand difficult to apply in the em ployment-solicitation context.  ER 104-07.  For \nexample, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-704  imposes minimum speed limits, but does \n5\nnot address stopping a vehicle in the midst of moving traffic.  ER 105.   Ariz. Rev. \nStat. Ann. § 13-2906, which provides crim inal penalties for obstructing highways \nand thoroughfares, does not apply to a pedestrian who stands in the street to talk to \na driver of a stopped vehicle unless t he pedestrian (as opposed to the stopped \nvehicle) is interfering with the flow of tr affic.  ER 106.  Applying Ariz. Rev. Stat. \nAnn. § 13-2906 to the driver of a vehicle who stops in the midst of traffic to solicit \nemployees can also be difficult because  of the statute’s potential conflicts with \nother statutes, such as Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann. §§ 28-871 and 28-873,  that permit \nsuch  stops in certain circum stances.    ER  106-07.   Parking laws address som e \n                                           \n4\n Some cities commissioned studies to help  identify ideas on how to solve these \nproblems.  See, e.g., ER 102 (“To study the issue, commissioners hit the streets for \nmonths to question laborers, business owners and neighbors.”). \n5\n Even where Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-7 04 can be enforced against a driver who \nstops a vehicle in moving traffic, an  officer who arrives on the scene after the  \nvehicle  is stopped may not know whethe r  the driver stopped the vehicle to \ncommunicate  with the prospective employ ee,  or stopped the ve hicle  for safety \nreasons after the prospective employee entered the roadway.  ER 105.  \n  - 10 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 18 of 49\n \nsituations in which a driver improperly st ops his or her car to comm unicate with a \nprospective employee, but not all situations, and the fines are fairly m inor (as low \nas $25), so they do not have a deterrent effect.  ER 106. \nPlaintiffs’ own evidence confirms that Arizona’s existing laws have failed to \ndeter these problems.  ER 541 (“[B]efore  Sections 5(a) and (b) of S.B. 1070 went \ninto effect . . . the jornalero mem bers sometimes . . . mad e their availability for \nwork known by . . . signaling to drivers w ith their hands or calling out to them ” \nand “[d]rivers who chose to  hire jornaleros typically pulled over on the public  \nstreet to negotiate the terms of employment.”); ER 527 (“It is common practice for \nprospective employers to temporarily stop or park their vehicles on a public right-\nof-way while they communicate and negotiate the hiring of a day laborer.”).   \nC.  The Legislature Enacted Sections 5(A) and (B) to Address Public \nSafety Concerns \nFor  many years before ultimately en acting  the provisions in 2010, the \nArizona Legislature considered several versions of the provisions codified in Ariz. \nRev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(A) and (B).   As su mmarized below, the legislative \nhistory of each bill reflects that the Le gislature was concerned about the traffic \nsafety, public safety, crime, occupational  safety, quality of life, aesthetics, and  \ncommercial  business problems creat ed  by  unregulated em ployment  solicitation \nalong busy streets and roads throughout Arizona.   \nIn  2007, the Legislature consider ed  H.B. 2589 as a means to address \n  - 11 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 19 of 49\n \nproblems related to “unsafe traffic conditions,” trespassing, and “a black-market of \nday labor that is uncontrolled, unsafe and unwanted by most residents of Arizona.”  \nH.B. 2589, 48th Leg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Ariz.  2007).  Dr. Melody Jafari urged t he \nHouse  Judiciary Committ ee  to pass  the  Bill because businesses in her  \nneighborhood were “being im pacted . . .  by vehicles stopping in the roadway in \nfront of [the] businesses to  negotiate contracts for la bor” and because day laborer \ngatherings led to “trespa ss, littering and defecating on  private property,” causing \n“the overall deterioration of a ppearance of the community.”   Minutes of Hearing \non H.B. 2589 Before the H. Comm. on Judiciary , 48th Leg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Ariz. \n2007).  As a Special Assistant County At torney for Maricopa County testified, the \nBill would treat day laborer solicitation di fferently than other trespasses becaus e \nday  laborer solicitation was “a specific  problem  that is calling out   for m ore \nsignificant sanctions.”  Id.  \nIn  2008, the Legislature considered  H.B.  2412, “a traffic  safety  bill” to \nprevent street solicitation of day labor that “disrupt[ed] traffic, harm[ed] business, \nexploit[ed] workers and degrade[d] neighborhoods.”  Minutes of Hearing on H.B. \n2412 Before the H. Comm. on Homeland Sec. & Prop. Rights , 48th Leg., 2d Reg. \nSess. (Ariz. 2008).  \nIn 2009, the Legislature considered  H.B. 2533, a bill nearly identical in \nlanguage to Sections 5(A) and (B) at issue in this case.   See H.B. 2533, 49th Leg., \n  - 12 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 20 of 49\n \n1st  Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2009).  H.B. 2533’ s  purpose was to address the unsafe \n“disruption of traffic” created by both “day laborers who congregate on the street  \nto solicit work [and by]  the individual who pulls up and solicits t he person to \nwork.”  Minutes of Hearing on H.B. 2533 Before the H. Comm. on Judiciary, 49th \nLeg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2009). \nIn 2010, H.B. 2042 was presented to t he House with the explanation that \n“the primary reason for the bill is public safety.”  Hearing on H.B. 2042 Before the \nH. Comm. on Judiciary, 49th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. 5 (A riz. 2010).  Representative \nKavanaugh,  who introduced the Bill,  further  explained that H.B. 2042 was \ndesigned to address labor solicitations that “disrupt[] traffic and cause[] injuries or \naccidents” and issues concerning “large day laborer gatherings, crimes in the areas \nof those gatherings, occupational safety for day laborers, black market employment \nof day laborers, illegal immigration issues related to day l abor, and tax issue s \ncreated by unreported cash payments  to day laborers  by employers.”   Id.  H.B. \n2042 passed in the House in February 2010  and was then passed to the Senate \nwhere it ultimately became an amendment to S.B. 1070. \nD.  Sections 5(A) and (B) Are Narro w Regulations on Conduct That \nRaises Significant Safety, Economic, and Environmental Concerns \nSections 5(A) and (B) are very narro w regulations of in-street employment \nsolicitation.  Specifically, Section 5(A) ma kes it unlawful: “for an occupant of a \nmotor vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway  to attempt to hire or \n  - 13 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 21 of 49\n \nhire and pick up passengers  for work at a different location  if the motor vehicle \nblocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic.”  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n2928(A) (emphasis added).  Section 5(B) makes it unlawful “for a person  to enter \na motor vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway in order to be hired \nby an occupant of t he motor vehicle and to  be transported to work at a different \nlocation if the motor vehicle blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic.”  \nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-2928(B) (emphasis added).   \nNothing  in Sections 5(A) or (B)  prohibits  any pers on  from  soliciting \nemployment in any manner that does not involve (1) a motor vehicle stopping on a \nroadway, and (2) conduct that blocks or i mpedes the normal movement of traffic.  \nNothing in Sections 5(A) or (B), therefor e, affects Plaintiffs’ and their memb ers’ \ncontinued right to solicit, negotiate, and secure employment in parking lots, while \nvehicles are properly parked on the side  of the street, in designated day labor \ncenters, on sidewalks, and even on streets  with little traffic—anywhere, for that \nmatter, where the solicitations and negotiations do not interfere with traffic. \nSummary of Argument \nThe district court erred in fi nding that Plaintiffs are likely to establish that \nSections 5(A) and (B) violate the First Am endment and, therefore, al so erred in \nfinding  that Plaintiffs’ probable succe ss  on the m erits  entitles Plaintiffs to \npreliminary  injunctive relie f.

Even if the First Amendment som ehow \ncreated  a right to solicit employm ent  in  such a   reckless and illegal manner, \nSections 5(A) and (B) are co nstitutional regulations on commerce because they  \ndirectly advance and are narrowly tailored to serve Arizona’s substantial interest in \ntraffic safety. \nLegal Discussion \nI \nStandard of Review \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely  \nto succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, that the balance of  equities tips in his favor, and that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008).  “A preliminary inj unction is an extraordinary re medy never \nawarded as of right. . . .

A district court’s factual \nfindings  are subject to a clearly erroneous standard, but   the district court’s \napplication  of the applicable legal prin ciples  “is  subject to de novo review.” \nStormans, 586 F.3d at 1119.  \nII \nSections 5(A) and (B) Are Subject to the Central Hudson \nFramework for Regulations on Commercial Speech \nA.  Sections 5(A) and (B) Regulate Commercial Speech \nSections 5(A) and (B) regulate only  employment solicitation, which is a \n“classic example[] of commercial speech.”   Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh \n6\nComm’n of Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 385 (1973).   The district court agreed \nthat Sections 5(A) and (B) govern commercial speech, properly rejecting Plaintiffs’ \nargument that employment solicitation is “‘inextricably intertwined’ with core First \nAmendment speech.”  ER 4; see also Bd. of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v.

Regulations  on Commercial  Speech  Are Subject to the  Central \nHudson Test  \nIn Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.  v. Public Service Commission of  \nNew  York,  447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980), the S upreme  Court established the \nframework  for evaluating the constituti onality  of regulati ons  on c ommercial \nspeech.   The Supreme Court has since applied the  Central  Hudson  test to \nregulations on commercial speech regard less of whether a challenged regulation \nwas content based or content neutral.  See, e.g., Thompson v. W. States Med. Ctr., \n535  U.S. 357, 367-68 (2002) (prohibit ions  on  solicitations and  advertising  for \ncompound drugs); Greater New Orleans Broad.

See Hunt, 638 F.3d at 715 (“[W]here only commercial \nspeech is at issue, the time, place, or manner framework does not apply and courts \napply the framework articulated in [Central Hudson].”); Metro Lights, LLC v.

See 507 \nU.S.  at 416 n.11 (“Because we conclude   that Cincinnati’s ban on commercial  \nnewsracks cannot withstand scrutiny under  Central Hudson and Fox, we need not \ndecide whether that policy should be subjected to more exacting review.”). \n  - 18 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 26 of 49\n \nCoyote Publ’g, Inc. v. Miller, 598 F.3d 592, 599 n.10 (9th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, \n131  S. Ct. 1556 (2011) (hol ding  that the  Central  Hudson  test  applies  to all \n8\nregulations of commercial speech, whether content based or content neutral).    \nC.  The District Court Erred In Concluding that  Sorrell Modified the \nTest Applicable to Sections 5(A) and (B) \nThe district court erroneously found that Sorrell “modified the commercial \nspeech test originally set forth in Central Hudson” for content-based regulations on \ncommercial speech.  ER 9.  In  Sorrell, the Court analyzed the First Amendment \nstandard applicable to a Ver mont statute that “burden[ed] disfavored speech by \ndisfavored speakers” and “‘[went]  even  beyond mere  content discrimination to \n9\nactual viewpoint discrimination.”  131 S. Ct. at 2663 (emphasis added).   Although \nthe Court noted that “heightened  judicial scrutiny was warranted,” id. at 2664, the \nSorrell  Court di d  not actually apply any form   of heighte ned  scrutiny or even \narticulate  what “heightened scrutiny” te st  might  apply in the circum stances.  \nInstead, the Court applied its established  Central Hudson test.   Id. at 2667.  The \n                                           \n8\n The Central Hudson test and the commercial speech doctrine were not addressed \nor at issue in Redondo Beach II.  657 F.3d at 945 n.2 (“ The City does not argue \nthat the Ordinance applies onl y to commercial solicitation, and its text does not \nlimit its reach to the commercial context.   Thus, we cannot, and do not, decide the \nOrdinance’s validity under the Supreme Court’s ‘commercial speech’ case law.”).   \n9\n  The Supreme Court has “im plicitly  distinguished  between restrictions on  \nexpression based on subject matter and restrictions based on viewpoint, indicating \nthat the latter are p articularly pernicious.  . . , and require[] pa rticular scrutiny, in \npart because such regulation often indicat es a leg islative effort to skew public \ndebate on an issue.”  R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 430 (1992) (Stevens, \nJ., concurring) (internal citations omitted)). \n  - 19 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 27 of 49\n \n10\nSorrell Court thus did not establish any alternative framework  for lower courts to \napply to content-based restrictions on commercial speech.   \nUntil the Supreme Court modifies or rejects the  Central Hudson test for \ncontent-based regulations on commercial speech, the  Central Hudson framework \nremains applicable.  See, e.g., Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc. , \n490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of  this Court has direct application in a \ncase, yet appears to rest on reasons reject ed in some other line of decisions, t he \nCourt of Appeals shoul d follow the case wh ich directly controls, leaving to t his \nCourt the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”); Metro Lights, 551 F.3d at \n911 (“[W]e are bound to follow the Suprem e Court precedent m ost directly on \npoint.”).   \nD.  Even if Sorrell Somehow Modified the Central Hudson Test for \nContent-Based Regulations on Commercial Speech, Sections 5(A) \nand (B) Are Not Content Based \n“Deciding whether a particular regulation is content based or content neutral \nis not always a simple task.”  Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC , 512 U.S. 622, 642 \n(1994).  “[T]he ‘principal inquiry in determining content-neutrality . . . is whether \nthe  government has adopted a regulation of   speech  because of [agreement or] \ndisagreement with the message it conveys.’”   Id. (quoting Ward v. Rock Against \n                                           \n10  The  district court found that   Sorrell  modified the  Central  Hudson  test for \ncontent-based regulations on commercial speech, but that is not correct.   Compare \nER 9 with Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2667-68 (relying on  Fox to support its articulation \nof the Central Hudson test). \n  - 20 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 28 of 49\n \nRacism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989));  accord Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2664 (quoting  \nWard).  Accordingly, the Supreme Court has consistently assessed the purpose of a \nchallenged regulation in determining its content neutrality. \n1.  A Regulation Is Content Neutral If Enacted to Address the \nSecondary Effects of the Regulated Speech \nA regulation is content neutral if it is justified by interests that are “unrelated \nto the suppression of free expression.”   City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc ., \n475 U.S. 41, 48 (1986)).  In  Renton, for example, the Supreme Court addressed a \nFirst Amendment challenge to an ordi nance “prohibit[ing] adult motion picture \ntheaters from locating within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, single- or multiple-\nfamily dwelling, church, park, or school. ”  475 U.S. at 43.  In determ ining the \napplicable standard, the Court recognized th at the ordinance did not “appear to fit \nneatly into either the ‘content-based’ or  the ‘content-neutral’ category” becaus e \n“the ordinance treat[ed] theaters that specialize in adult films differently from other \nkinds of theaters.”  Id. at 47.  The Court found, howe ver, that the ordinance was \n“aimed not at the content of the films shown . . . but rather at the secondary effects \nof such theaters on the surrounding community” because the ordinance’s primary \npurpose was to “pre vent crime, protect th e city’s retail trade,  maintain property \nvalues,  and generally [protect]   and [p reserve]  the quality of [the City’s] \n  - 21 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 29 of 49\n \n11\nneighborhoods, commercial districts, and the quality of urban life.’”  Id. at 47-48.   \nThe fact that regulating the conten t of adult film s may have been “ a motivating \nfactor” in enacting the ordinance did not control the  Court’s conclusion.  Id. at 47 \n(emphasis  in original).  Instead, the  Court  found the ordinance “com pletely \nconsistent  with [its] d efinition  of ‘c ontent-neutral’  speech regulations” and \n“justified  without reference to the cont ent  of the regulated speech.”   Id.  at 48 \n(emphasis in original). \nSimilarly,  in  Turner  Broadcasting Syst em,  512 U.S. at 658, 661-62, the \nSupreme  Court applied i ntermediate  scrutiny to regulations that facially  \ndistinguished between broadcasters and cable programmers.  The plaintiffs argued \nthat  the speaker-based distinction requi red  strict scrutiny and even identified \nportions of the legislative history in which Congress noted the value of broadcast \nprogramming.  The Court rejected the ar gument, however, because the legislative \nhistory demonstrated that Congress did not  enact the statute because it  “preferred \nbroadcasters over cable progra mmers based on the content of programm ing each \n12\ngroup offers.”  Id. at 658-59.    \n                                           \n11\n  The Court observed that had the City ’s  purpose been to regulate First \nAmendment rights, the City “would have trie d to close the [the adult theaters ] or \nrestrict their number rather than circumscribe their choice as to location.”  Id. at 48 \n(citation omitted).   \n12 The Court also found that the chall enged provisions were not content based on \ntheir face and were not intended to disfavor particular content. \n  - 22 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 30 of 49\n \nThis  Court has also repeatedly r ecognized  that a regulation aimed at \naddressing  the seco ndary  effects of regul ated  speech is content neutral.  I n \nColacurcio v. City of Kent, 163 F.3d 545, 553 (9th Cir. 1998), for e xample, the \nNinth Circuit held that a regulation on  nude table dancing was content neutral  \nbecause the City’s predominant purpose in enacting the ordinance was to “control[] \nprostitution, drug dealing, and other crim inal activity.”  Al though the appellants \nhad  presented some evidence that City   officials intended t o  discourage nude \ndancing generally, the court found the eviden ce inconsequential, holding that: “[a] \nfinding that the restriction of First Am endment speech is a ‘motivating factor’ i n \nenacting an ordinance is not of itself sufficient to hold the regulation presumptively \ninvalid.”  Id. at 551.  See also Dish Network Corp. v. FCC, 653 F.3d 771, 778 (9th \nCir. 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1162 (2011) (“[E]ven  a statute that facially \ndistinguishes a category of  speech or speakers is conten t-neutral if justified by \ninterests  that are ‘ unrelated  to the  suppression  of free expression.’” (citation \nomitted)); Tollis v. San Bernardino Cnty., 827 F.2d 1329, 1332 (9th Cir.  1987) (if \n“the  predominant  purpose of the [regula tion]  is the amelioration of secondary \neffects, then [it] is content-neutral”).   \n2.  A Regulation Is Content Based If It Is Designed to Suppress \nDisfavored Speech or Speech by Disfavored Speakers \nA regulation is cont ent based where cl ear evidence demonstrates that the \ngovernment’s intent was to suppress disfavored speech.   In  Sorrell, for example, \n  - 23 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 31 of 49\n \nthe Supreme Court held that  “heightened scrutiny” applied to a regulation that \n“disfavor[ed]  marketing”  and “disfavor[ed ]  specific speaker s,  namely \npharmaceutical manufacturers.”  131 S. Ct.  at 2663.  The Court did not begin and \nend its analysis, however, with the statut e’s text.  Instead, the Court evaluated the \nformal legislative findings accompanying the challenged provision and determined \nthat the Vermont Legislature intended to single out certain speakers because they  \n“convey messages that ‘are often in conflict with the goals of the state.’”   Id. \n(quoting 2007 Vt. No. 80 § 1(3));  see also id. at 2672 (“‘The goals of marketing \nprograms, the legislature said, ‘are often in  conflict with the goals of the state.’ §  \n1(3).   The text of § 4631(d), associat ed  legislative findings, and the record \ndeveloped in the District Court establish that Vermont enacted the law for this end. \n. . . At the same time, the State has left unburdened those speakers whose messages \nare in accord with its own views.”).     \nIn Discovery Networks, 507 U.S. at 429, the Supr eme Court rejected the \nargument  that a sweeping ban on comme rcial  newsracks was content-neutra l \nbecause (1) “the very basis for the regula tion is the difference in content between  \nordinary newspapers and commercial speech,” and (2) the City’s only justification \nfor singling out commercial publications was its “naked assertion that commercial \nspeech has ‘low value.’”  Id. at 429.  In other words, the Court did not find the ban \ncontent-based  solely because of its faci al  distinction between newspapers and  \n  - 24 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 32 of 49\n \ncommercial  handbills; rather, it held that   “[i]t  is the absence of a n eutral \njustification  for its sel ective  ban on newsracks   that prevents the city from \n13\ndefending its newsrack policy as content-neutral.”  Id. at 429-30.  \nIn United States v. Playboy  Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 811 \n(2000), the Court addressed a regulation th at “applies only to channels prim arily \ndedicated to ‘sexually explicit adult pr ogramming or other programm ing that is \nindecent’” and found that the regulation was content based because: \nThe overriding justification for the regulation is concern for the effect \nof the subject matter on young viewers.  Section 505 is not “j ustified \nwithout  reference  to  the content of the regulated speech.” . . . It \n“focuses only on the content of the speech and the direct i mpact that \nspeech has on its listeners.” . . . This  is the essence of content-based \nregulation. \n \nId. at 811-12 (internal citations om itted).  As in  Discovery Networks, therefore, it \nwas the absence of a content-neutral justification for the challenged regulation that \nled the Court to apply strict scrutiny.  See also Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members \nof N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991) (regulation was content-\nbased  where  it targeted speech by crimin als  and the State offered no content-\nneutral  justification);  Minneapolis  Star & Tribune Co. v. Minn. Comm’r of \nRevenue, 460 U.S. 575, 585 (1983)  (a tax imposed on newspapers subjected to \nheightened  scrutiny becaus e  “differential treatment,  unless  justified by so me \n                                           \n13 As stated in Section II(D)(2), supra, the Discovery Networks Court evaluated the \nconstitutionality of the ban under the Central Hudson framework. \n  - 25 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 33 of 49\n \nspecial characteristics of the press, suggests that the goal of the regulation is not \nunrelated to suppression of expression” (emphasis added)). \n3.  The Record Does Not Support a Finding that Sections 5(A) \nand (B) Were Enacted to Suppress Disfavored Speech \nSections 5(A) and (B) are content neutral because the legislative history and \nthe statutes themselves demonstrate that the purpose of Sections 5(A) and (B) is to \naddress the problematic direct effects of  the prohibited conduct (impeding traffic) \nand the secondary effects crea ted by and arising out  of the solicitation of work in \nbusy streets and roadways in Arizona.  See supra pp. 7-14.  The record contains no \nevidence  that Sections 5(A) and (B) we re  primarily enact ed  to suppress the \nsolicitation of employment.  See Renton, 475 U.S. at 48.   \nThe district court’s finding that Sections 5(A) and (B) are content based was \nerroneous in three respects.  First, the dist rict court erred in relying on its ruling at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage that Sections  5(A) and (B) are cont ent based.  ER 6 \n(“The Court has previously found that  [Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.]  § 13-2928(A) and \n(B) are content-based because they apply only to speech soliciting employment and \nnot to other types of solicitation speech .”).  Not only was the court’s previous \n  - 26 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 34 of 49\n \n14\nruling subject to a different legal standard,  but it did not (and could not) involve \nany evaluation of t he Arizona Legislature’s stated purpose for enacting Sections \n5(A) and (B).  ER 575.  Accordingl y, the district court’s motion-to-dismiss ruling \nshould not have controlled the court’s ruling at the preliminary-injunction stage. \nSecond,  the district court erred in  disregarding  Arizona’s content-neutral \njustification  for Sections 5(A) and (B).    The co ntent-neutral  purpose for these \nprovisions  (traffic safety) is not subj ect  to reasonable dispute because the \nprovisions regulate employment solicitation only when such solicitation directly \ninterferes with moving traffic.  Arizona also presented  unrefuted evidence that in-\nstreet  employment  solicitation causes signifi cantly  greater safety concerns than \nother  forms  of solicitation.  ER 322-24,   326, 363, 363,   411.  Arizona further \npresented evidence that the Arizona Legislature enacted Sections 5(A) and (B) to \naddress  public safety.  All of this ev idence  is highly relevant to the content-\nneutrality of Sections 5(A) and (B).   See, e.g., Sorrell, 131 S. Ct. at 2672;  Renton, \n475 U.S. at 47.  The district court, theref ore, committed clear error by refusing to \nconsider it. \n                                           \n14 In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a court considers \nonly  what has been alleged in the com plaint.   In connection with Plaintiffs’ \nmotions for a preliminary injunction, however, the parties  submitted hundreds of \npages of evidence to the district court.   See ER 92-107, 131-207, 234-96, 322-493, \n523-55.  The district court’s fi nding that Plaintiffs’ pleading passed m uster under \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) should not have precluded the court from considering that \nevidence or Arizona’s argument regarding  the Arizona Legislature’s purpose for \nenacting Sections 5(A) and (B). \n  - 27 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 35 of 49\n \nThird, the district court erred in relying on  Sorrell because the Verm ont \nstatute at issue in  Sorrell is worlds apart from  Sections 5(A) and (B).  As the \nSorrell Court found, the cha llenged Vermont statute was intended to “burden[] \ndisfavored speech by disfavored speaker s” and “‘goes even beyond m ere content \ndiscrimination to actual viewpoint discrimination.”  Id. at 2663 (emphasis added).  \nHere, by contrast, there is no evidence that  Sections 5(A) and (B) were enact ed to \nsuppress employment solicitation, much less any particular viewpoint.   Sorrell is \ntherefore neither on point nor controlling. \nFor  all these reasons, Sections 5(A)  and  (B) are subject to interm ediate \nscrutiny under the Central Hudson test.   \nIII \nSections 5(A) and (B) Are Constitutional Under Central Hudson \nA.  The Conduct Sections 5(A) and (B) Regulate Does Not Merit First \nAmendment Protection \nFor  commercial  speech  to receive  First  Amendment  protection, it “m ust \nconcern lawful activity and not be misleading.”  Fox, 492 U.S. at 475.  The First  \nAmendment does not protect unlawful activity.   World Wide Rush, LLC v. City of \nLos Angeles, 606 F.3d 676, 684 (9th Cir. 2010).  In Pittsburgh Press, for example, \nthe Supreme Court addressed a First Amen dment challenge to an ordinance that \nsought  to elim inate  discriminatory  help-wanted  advertisements by prohibiting \nnewspapers  from  “carry[ing] ‘help-want ed’  advertisements  in sex-designated \n  - 28 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 36 of 49\n \ncolumns  except where the employer or adve rtiser  is fre e  to make hiring or \nemployment referral decisions on the basis  of sex.”  413 U.S. at 378.  The Court \nfound the ordinance valid because:  “A ny First Amendment interest which might \nbe  served by advertising an ordinary   commercial proposal   and which m ight \narguably outweigh the governmental interest supporting the regulation is altogether \nabsent when the commercial activity itself is illegal . . .”   Id. at 388-89.  Thus, the \nSupreme Court found that otherwise lawf ul speech (employment advertisement s) \nlost its First Amendment protection when  associated with unlawful activity (sex \ndiscrimination). \nAs in Pittsburgh Press, Sections 5(A) and (B) regulate the location of the \ncommercial  speech (em ployment  solicitation)  only  when  it is associated with \nunlawful activity (blocking or im peding traffic).  Because Plaintiffs have no right \nto block or impede traffic and Sections  5(A) and (B) do not regulate Plaintiffs’ \nactivities when they are not blocking traffic, Plaintiffs’ activities are not protected \nunder the First Amendment.  See Pittsburgh Press, 413 U.S. at 385.  The distri ct \ncourt rejected this argument without a ddressing Pittsburgh Press or explaining \nwhy  Plaintiffs have   a First Amendmen t  right t o  conduct  the solicitation of \nemployment in a manner that blocks or impe des the normal movement of traffic .  \nThe district court therefore erred in find ing that Sections 5(A) and (B) concern \notherwise lawful activity. \n  - 29 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 37 of 49\n \nB.  Even If Sections 5(A) and (B)  Governed Protected Speech, the \nRegulations Satisfy the Central Hudson Test \nEven if one were to assume that Se ctions 5(A) and (B) did regulate conduct  \nthat is somehow otherwise lawful, Secti ons 5(A) and (B) w ould still withstand \nscrutiny under Central Hudson.  A regulation on commerci al speech protected by \nthe First Amendment m ust satisfy Central Hudson’s three-part test.   Hunt, 638 \nF.3d at 716.  Under the first prong, “‘[t]he State must assert a substantial interest to \nbe  achieved by restrictions on commercial speech.’”   Id.  (citation om itted).  \nSections 5(A) and (B) easily satisfy th is prong because Arizona has identified \nseveral  interests that these provisions  serve—traffic  safety,  crime  reduction, \neconomic development, and protecting th e aesthetics of its co mmunities—all of \n15\nwhich  are well-established as substant ial,  if not co mpelling,  interests.     The \ndistrict court agreed “that  Arizona has asserted several substantial governmental \ninterests that animate [Ariz. Rev. Stat . Ann.] § 13-2928(A) and (B), including t he \none on which [Arizona] principally rel[ies], traffic safety.”  ER 7.   \n                                           \n15\n  See  United States v.

Int’l Soc. for  Krishna Consciousness, Inc., \n452 U.S. 640, 653 (1981) (“As a ge neral matter, it is clear that a State’s interest in \nprotecting the ‘safety and convenience’ of  persons using a public forum is a vali d \ngovernmental objective.”); Reed v.

City & Cnty. of Honol ulu, 455 F.3d 910, 922 (9th Cir. \n2006) (“It is well established t hat regulation for purposes of preserving aesthetics \nand promoting safety falls within the leg itimate and substantial interests of local \ngovernments.”). \n  - 30 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 38 of 49\n \nTo satisfy the second prong of the  Central Hudson test, “‘the restriction \nmust directly advance the int erest involved.’”   Hunt, 638 F.3d at 716 (citation \nomitted).  In  Coyote Publishing, 598 F.3d at 608, for exam ple, the Ninth Circuit \nfound that regulations on advertising by  legal brothels “directly and materially \nadvance Nevada’s interest in lim iting commodification [of sex] by reducing the \nmarket demand for, and thus the incidence of, the exchange of sex acts for money.”  \nAnd in World Wide Rush, the Ninth Circuit found that there was “no question that \nrestrictions  on billboards advance cities’  substantial  interests in aesthetics and \nsafety.”  606 F.3d at 685.   \nAs the district court found, Sections 5(A) and (B) directly advance Arizona’s \ninterest  in traffic safety by prohibiti ng  in-street em ployment  solicitation “only \n16\nwhere  that solicitation im pedes  traffic.”    ER 9.  Sections 5(A) and (B) also \ndirectly advance Arizona’s interest in addressing the secondary effects of in-street \nemployment solicitation because they redu ce the incentive for persons to solicit \nemployment along Arizona’s roadways.  The fact that Sections 5(A) and (B) do not \nregulate all forms of in-street so licitation does not  alter the analysis because in-\nstreet employment solicitation is far more prevalent and harmful than other forms \n                                           \n16\n The identification of one substantial interest  is sufficient to justify a regulation.   \nSee, e.g., Bland v. Fessler , 88 F.3d 729, 734 n.8 (9th Cir. 1996) (“B ecause we \nconclude that the protection of privacy is a sufficiently signi ficant governmental \ninterest to justify the statute, we need not address plaintiffs’ arguments with respect \nto other rationales.”). \n  - 31 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 39 of 49\n \nof in-street solicitation.   See supra pp. 7-9;  World Wide Rush, 606 F.3d at 685 \n(rejecting  the argument that exceptions  to  the City’s billboard regulations \n“undermine the City’s interest s in aesthetics and safety,” and  holding that there \nmust  be “som e  judicial ‘deference fo r  a [governmental entity’s]   reasonably \ngraduated response to different aspects of a problem”  (citation omitted)).  In fact, \nPlaintiffs’ own evidence demo nstrates the deterrent effect Sections 5(A) and (B) \nhave had on the mass roadside congregations of prospective employees that caused \nthe secondary effects.  ER 135-37, 205-07.     \nTo satisfy the final prong of the Central Hudson test, the regulation must be \n“not  more  extensive than is necessary  to  serve [the State’s] interest.”   Coyote \nPubl’g, 598 F.3d at 602 (citation omitted).  Arizona “is not required to employ the \nleast restrictive means conceivable,’ but  ‘it must demonstrate narrow tailoring of \nthe challenged regulation to the asserted in terest – a fit that is not necess arily \n17\nperfect, but reasonable.’”  Id. at 609 (citation omitted).      \nIn  Coyote  Publishing,  for e xample,  the Ninth Circuit found tha t  the \nadvertising regulations were narrowly tailored because “[ e]very advertisement for \nprostitution that is not seen contri butes to limiting the commodification of sex, \nboth directly and by reducing demand.”   Id.  In Hunt, the Ninth Circuit found that \n                                           \n17 Unlike in noncommercial speech cases, “the overbreadth doctrine does not apply \nto commercial speech.”  Village of Hoffman Estates v.

The District Court Erred In Finding that Sections 5(A) and (B) \nFailed the Final Prong of the Central Hudson Test \nThe district court found that Sections  5(A) and (B) failed the final prong of \nthe  Central  Hudson  test for two reasons.  First, the district court found that \n“numerous other traffic regul ations are already in place in Arizona to ‘directly \naddress traffic safety without restricting speech.’”  ER 10.  This finding was clearly \nerroneous because the record does not su pport a finding that Arizona’s existing \nlaws  are  sufficient to address the safe ty  concerns arising out of in-street \nemployment solicitation.  The district co urt did not address the evidence Arizona \n  - 33 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 41 of 49\n \npresented  on thi s  issue (which Plaintiffs fa iled  to rebut), including: (1) a \ndeclaration from a veteran of the City of Phoenix Police Department explaining the \ndifficulty in applying these other regula tions to in-street employm ent situations, \nER  105-07; (2) the   unsuccessful  efforts of   various jurisdictions in Arizona t o \nenforce  the existing traffic laws as a  means  to co mbat  in-street  employment \nsolicitations, ER 95, 97,  102, 483; and (3) the substantial evidence (see, e.g., ER \n95, 97, 99-100, 102, 328-30, 343-44, 41 0-11, 482-83, 485-86, 490-91), including \nPlaintiffs’ own declarations (ER 135-37, 205-07), that the existing traffic laws had \ninsufficient or no deterrent effect on in-street employment solicitation.   \nEven  if t he  record could support   a fi nding  that  existing traffic laws are \nsufficient to address Arizona’s traffic safe ty concerns, the district court’s finding \nwould still be erroneous because it effectively requires Arizona to employ the least \nrestrictive means available.  That is not the standard under the prevailing precedent \nof the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit.  See, e.g., Coyote Publishing, 598 F.3d at \n609 (“[A]lmost all of the restrictions disallowed under  Central Hudson’s fourth \nprong have been substantially excessive, disregarding far less restrictive and more \nprecise means.”) (quoting Fox, 492 U.S. at 479).   \nSecond, the district court erroneously  found that because Sections 5(A) and \n(B) were enacted as part of S.B. 1070, t hey were “not drawn to achieve Arizona’s \ngoal of promoting traffic safety.”  ER 11.  Again, the district court did not address \n  - 34 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 42 of 49\n \nthe evidence Arizona provide d regarding the several years of legislat ive history \nthat preceded the enactment of Sections 5(A) and (B).   In fact, Sections 5(A) and \n(B) passed in the House as a separate bill, H.B. 2042, before S.B. 1070 was even \nintroduced.  When H.B. 2042 went to the  Senate, it became an amendment to S.B. \n18\n1070.   That Sections 5(A) and (B) were ultimately included within a larger statute \nas  part of legislative com promise  and  efficiency should not be a basis for \ndisregarding the totality of legislative  history, and it certa inly should not be  the \nbasis upon which Sections 5(A) and (B) are held to violate the First Amendment. \nIV \nSections 5(A) and (B) Are Also Valid Time, Place, or Manner Regulations \nAlthough  they need not do so, Sec tions  5(A) and (B) also withstand \nintermediate scrutiny under the test for fu lly protected speech because they are \n19\nvalid  time, place, o r  manner  regulations.    A State may “impose reasonable \n                                           \n18\n  See  Bill Status Overview (H.B. 204 2),  http://www.azleg.gov//Format \nDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2042o.asp&Session_ID=93  (last \nvisited May 8, 2012). \n19\n The time, place, or m anner test applies to regulations on speech in a public \nforum.   Regulations on speech in a no npublic  forum,  however, need only be \nreasonable  and not viewpoint-based.   See  Children of the Rosary v. City of \nPhoenix,  154 F.3d 972, 979 (9th Cir. 1998).    Although st reets  are generally \nconsidered  public fora, “courts should   ‘focus[]  on the access sought by the \nspeaker’ and not the [char acter of the forum] in general.”   Currier v. Potter, 379 \nF.3d 716, 727 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted); see also United States v. Kokinda, \n497 U.S. 720, 727 (1990).  Here, Plaintiffs  seek to enter Arizona’s streets in a \nmanner that “blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic.”  Streets “are not \ndesignated as forums for public communication while in use by vehicular traffic.”   \nACORN v. City of Phoenix, 603 F. Supp. 869, 871 (D. Ariz. 1985).   \n  - 35 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 43 of 49\n \nrestrictions  on the time, place, or  manner  of protected speech,” where the \nregulations are content-neutral.  Ward, 491 U.S. at 791.  Sections 5(A) and (B) are \nreasonable  time, place, and  manner  regulations for the same reason s  they are \nsufficiently tailored under the Central Hudson test.  See Section III, supra; see also \nMoser v. FCC, 46 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting the similarity between the \nCentral Hudson test and the time, place, or manner test).  Moreover, Sections 5(A) \nand (B) do not prohibit peop le from soliciting or negotiating em ployment, they \n“merely regulate[] the places where communications may occur.”   Colorado v. \nHill, 530 U.S. 703, 731 (2000);  see also Dish Net work, 653 F.3d at 780 (“The \nquestion is not whether [the Legislature] was correct to determine that a particular \nstatute was necessary, but whether its det ermination was reasonable and based on \nsubstantial evidence.”).  Sections 5(A) and (B) leav e open numerous alternative \nchannels of communication because they do not in any way restrict Plaintiffs and \ntheir members from soliciting, negotiating, and securing day labor anywhere where \nthe solicitations and negotiations do not physically interfere with moving traffic. \nV \n \nThe District Court’s Errors With Respect to Plaintiffs’ \nLikelihood of Success on the Merits Requires Reversal of the \nDistrict Court’s Conclusions with Respect to the Non-Merits Factors \nThe district court found that each of th e non-merits factors weighed in favor \nof granting the injunction because “Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of \n  - 36 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 44 of 49\n \n20\ntheir First Amendment challenge to [Sections 5(A) and (B)]”  and “the individual \nday  laborer Plaintiffs and day laborer  members  of som e  of the organizational \nPlaintiffs are being chilled from soliciting day labor.”  ER 11-12.  Plaintiffs are not \nlikely  to suffer irreparable harm.  Plai ntiffs’  members  are not prohi bited  from \nsoliciting employment—they need only do so in a manner that does not disrupt the \nflow of traffic.   See Hale v. Dep’t of Energy , 806 F.2d 910, 918  (9th Cir. 1986) \n(“The First Amendment does not guarantee  an optimal setting for speech at all  \ntimes and places.”).   \nMoreover, Sections 5(A) and (B) regul ate conduct that is already unlawful \n(entering the street and blocking or impeding traffic).  See ER 10 (citing Ariz. Rev. \nStat. Ann. §§ 13-2906(A), 28-871(A), 28-7 04(A), 28-873(A), 28-905).  Plaintiffs \ncannot be “harmed” by being prohibited from engaging in conduct (i.e., interfering \nwith traffic) that Plaintiffs the mselves concede is illegal, even if their purpose for \ndoing so is to solicit employment.  The First Amendment does not grant Plaintiffs \nthe right to engage in unlawful conduc t.  As the Suprem e Court held in  Cox v. \nLouisiana, \nThe rights of free s peech and assembly, while fu ndamental in our \ndemocratic society, still do not m ean that everyone with opinions or \nbeliefs to express may address a gr oup at any public place and at any \ntime. The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of \n                                           \n20\n A finding that the Plaintiffs are likely  to establish an alleged First Amendment \nviolation does not autom atically justify a finding of irreparable harm .  See Dish, \n653 F.3d at 776 (“[ P]roving the likelihood of [a First Am endment] claim is not \nenough to satisfy Winter.”).   \n  - 37 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 45 of 49\n \nan organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty \nitself would be lost in the excesses  of anarchy. The control of travel \non the streets is a clear example  of governmental responsibility to \ninsure this necessary order. A restriction in that relation, designed to \npromote  the public convenience in  the  interest of all, and not  \nsusceptible  to abuses of di scriminatory  application,  cannot be \ndisregarded by the attempted exercise  of some civil right which, in \nother circumstances, would be entitle d to protection. One would not \nbe justified in ignoring the familiar red light because this was thought \nto be a means of social protest.  Nor could one, contrary to traffic \nregulations, insist upon a street meeting in the middle of Times Square \nat  the rush hour as a form of   freedom of speech or assembly . \nGovernmental  authorities have th e  duty and responsibility to keep \ntheir streets open and available for movement. \n379 U.S. 536, 554 (1965) (emphasis added).   \nTo  the extent Plaintiffs argue th at  their members are “chilled” from \nsoliciting employment in a manner that does  not require them to enter a stopped \nvehicle on a traffic-filled street because  they “fear” they will be arrested under \nSections  5(A) and (B), such fears cannot provide a basis for Pl aintiffs  to \nchallenge—much less for a co urt to enjoin—these provisions.  Sections 5(A) and \n(B) do not authorize a law enforcemen t officer to arrest a day laborer  unless the \nday laborer enters a m otor vehicle that  is stopped on a roadway and blocking or \nimpeding traffic.  Because this is a pr e-enforcement facial challenge, the Court  \nmust presume that Arizona’s law enforc ement officers will enforce the provisions \nin accordance with their terms and in a constitutional manner.   See, e.g., Panama \nRefining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 446 (1935) (“Every public officer is presumed \nto act in obedience t o his duty…”).  Mo reover, a preliminary injunction “will not \n  - 38 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 46 of 49\n \nbe granted against something merely feared  as liable to occur at some indefinite \ntime in the future.”   Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 674 (1931); \nContinental Baking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U.S. 352, 369 (1932) (“[A]ppellants had \nno right to resort to equity merely because of an anticipation of improper or invalid \naction in administration.”). \nIn  contrast to Plaintiffs’ speculativ e  allegations of ha rm,  Arizona has a \nsubstantial interest in the safety of its  streets and reducing the crime, intimidation, \nand property destruction that results when large groups of day laborers congregate \nin and along busy roadsides and engage in conduct that interferes with traffic.  See \nsupra pp. 7-9.  The balance of equities therefore tips sharply in Arizona’s favor.   \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should vacate the preliminary \ninjunction of Sections 5(A) and (B). \n  - 39 -   \n\nCase: 12-15688     05/09/2012     ID: 8171786     DktEntry: 32-1     Page: 47 of 49\n \nDated: May 9, 2012 \nSNELL & WILMER L.L.P. \nBy s/John J.

In particular, this policy is intended to articulate the \nconstitutional limits demarcated in Rodriguez v.  United States, 135 S. Ct. 1609 (20 15); Arizona v. \nUnited States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012); and Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2012), \namong other applicable authority. \nI.  The Statute \nThe relevant sections of A.R.S. § 11-1051 provide: \nB.  For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement official \nor a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law \nenforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this \nstate in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town or \nthis state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is \nunlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when \npracticable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the \ndetermination may hinder or obstruct an  investigation.  Any  person who is \narrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is \nreleased.  The person's immigration status shall be verified with the federal \n1  Although this opinion is designated \"informal\", the analysis contained herein has the same \npersuasive weight as the analysis in a formal Attorney General opinion. \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1300   Filed 09/19/16   Page 5 of 10\ngovernment pursuant to 8 United States Code § 1373(c).  A law enforcement \nofficial or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision \nof this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the \nrequirements oft his subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States \nor Arizona  Constitution.  A person  is presumed to  not be  an  alien who  is \nunlawfully  present  in  the  United  States  if the  person  provides  to  the  law \nenforcement officer or agency any of the following: \nI.  A valid Arizona driver license. \n2.  A valid Arizona nonoperating identification license. \n3.  A valid tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal identification. \n4.  If the entity requires proof of legal presence in the United States before \nissuance,  any valid  United  States federal,  state  or local  government  issued \nidentification. \nD.  Notwithstanding any other law, a law enforcement agency may securely \ntransport an alien who the agency has received verification is unlawfully present \nin the United States and who is in the agency's custody to a federal facility in this \nstate or to any other point of transfer into federal custody that is outside the \njurisdiction of the law enforcement agency.  A law enforcement agency shall \nobtain  judicial  authorization  before  securely  transporting  an  alien  who  is \nunlawfully present in the United States to a point of transfer that is outside of this \nstate. \nII.  Policy \nLaw enforcement officers shall conduct contacts with individuals suspected of being unlawfully \npresent in the United States in a manner consistent with federal and state laws.  See A.R.S. \n§ ll-105l(L).  Officers shall protect the civil rights, privileges, and immunities of all persons. \nOfficers shall not prolong a  stop,  detention,  or arrest solely for  the purpose of verifying \nimmigration status.  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2509 (\"Detaining individuals solely to verify their \nimmigration status would raise constitutional concerns.\") If an officer deviates from this policy, \nthe officer must notif'y a supervisor at the first reasonable opportunity. Officers shall not contact, \nstop, detain, or arrest an individual based on race, color, or national origin, except when it is part \nof a suspect description  linking that individual to a particular unlawful  incident and  said \ndescription is timely, reliable, and geographically relevant or when otherwise authorized by law. \nSee A.R.S. § 11-1051(B). \nIII.  Definitions \nThe following definitions will apply to the terms below as discussed in this informal \nopinion: \nAlien: Any individual not a citizen or national of the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3). \n2 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1300   Filed 09/19/16   Page 6 of 10\nCivil immigration violation: A violation ofa  federal civil immigration law. Offenses include, but are \nnot limited to, unlawful presence of an alien in the United States; an alien whose visa has expired \nand has not been renewed; or an alien who seeks or engages in unauthorized employment.  See, \ngenerally, 8 U.S.C. §1227(a)(1)(B)-(C).2 \nCriminal immigration violation:  A violation of a federal criminal immigration law.  Offenses \ninclude, but are not limited to, violations of Title 8, U.S.C., §1324; Title 8, U.S.C. §1325(a); and \nTitle 8, U.S.C. §1326. \nDetermine:  To  ascertain or conclude,  especially after observation  or consideration.  See \nDictionary.com, http://www.dictionary.com (15 Apr. 2016).  Only the federal government may \ndetermine immigration status.  Arizona,  132 S. Ct. at 2498  (\"The Government of the United \nStates has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens.\"); see \nalso Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 225 (1982) (\"The States enjoy no power with respect to the \nclassification of aliens.\"). \nICEICBP:  Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Customs and Border Protection. \nImmigration status:  The legal standing of an alien's presence in the United States. \nProbable cause: Reliable information based on facts and circumstances sufficient to lead to the \nconclusion that it is more likely than not that a crime has been committed and that the individual \nto be arrested has committed it.  See,  e.g., Maryland v.  Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, (2003) (\"The \nsubstance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.\") \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) \nReasonable suspicion:  Specific facts which taken together with rational inferences from those \nfacts support an objective belief that an individual has committed or is aboutto commit an offense; \nbased upon the facts that exist, there is reason to investigate fmther.  An officer may stop or \nbriefly detain an individual for further investigation based on reasonable suspicion (a Terry stop), but \nmay not arrest on that basis alone.  See Terry v. Ohio, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968). \nUnlawfully present:  For the purpose of applying § 2(B) and 2(D) of S.B. I 070, officers may \nconsider an alien \"unlawfully present\" only if the alien is NOT: (1) a lawful or conditional \npermanent resident; (2) a nonimmigrant in an authorized period of stay; (3) a refugee or asylee; or \n(4) otherwise authorized or allowed to remain in the United States by federal law or the federal \nDepartment of Homeland Security. 3 \nVerifY:  To prove to be true; confirm; substantiate. Dictionary.com, http://www.dictionary.com \n(15 Apr. 2016). \n2  State law enforcement officers generally lack authority to detain individuals for civil \nviolations of immigration law.  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506 (\"Federal law specifies limited \ncircumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.\"). \n3  This definition is for purposes of this policy alone. \n3 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1300   Filed 09/19/16   Page 7 of 10\nIV.  Consensual Contacts \nState laws related to immigration enforcement neither expand nor limit an officer's ability \nto approach an individual and engage in a consensual contact.  During a consensual contact, the \nofficer may inquire about any subject matter. However, the individual contacted does not have to \nanswer questions or produce any identification, but may choose to do so voluntarily.  See, e.g., \nFlorida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983).  During a consensual contact, officers may ask, but \nshall not demand, that an individual produce immigration documents. \nV.  Individuals Lawfully Stopped or Detained \nOfficers shall not prolong a stop or detention for an immigration inquiry to request or \nobtain verification of immigration status, or prolong a criminal investigation or inquiry in order to \naccommodate or complete immigration-related tasks.  Arizona,  132  S.Ct.at 2509; see also \nRodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1614-16. \nAn officer shall presume that a person is lawfully present in the United States if the person \nprovides any of the following: a valid Arizona driver license or nonoperating identification \nlicense; a valid tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal identification; or any valid United \nStates federal, state or local government issued identification, provided the issuing entity requires \nproofoflegalpresence in the United States.  A.R.S. § ll-105l(B)(l)-(4). \nIf in the course of duty an officer has reasonable suspicion that an individual is unlawfully \npresent in the United States, based on all available facts, except race or ethnicity, the officer shall \nattempt to verify the individual's immigration status by contacting ICE/CBP unless doing so \nwould prolong the stop or detention, or the circumstances below apply.  The officer shall, \nconsistent with department policies, document the verification attempt, including the basis for the \nofficer's reasonable suspicion as to unlawful presence and any response from ICE/CBP, in the stop \ndata collection system. 4 \nIf it is not practicable for an officer to investigate or verify an individual's immigration \nstatus due to factors such as call load, staffing, emergencies, other present duties, availability of \npersonnel on scene, location, available back-up, ability to contact ICE/CBP, or the availability of \nICE/CBP, the officer may, consistent with department policies, use discretion not to pursue an \ninvestigation into the individual's immigration status, but shall document the justification for \nsuch a decision in the stop data collection system. \nIf an officer has reasonable suspicion that an individual is unlawfully present, but believes \nthat investigating or verifying immigration status may hinder or obstruct an investigation, the \nofficer may, consistent with department policies, use discretion notto inquire into the individual's \n4  \"In January 2003, the Arizona Department of Public Safety began voluntarily collecting data \nregarding traffic and pedestrian stops, including information pertaining to the characteristics of \nthe traffic stop, driver, vehicle and officer(s).\" \nSee http://www.azdps.gov/about/reports/docs/Traffic  Stop  Response  2008.pdf  (last  visited \n09113/16) \n4 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1300   Filed 09/19/16   Page 8 of 10\nimmigration status. A.R.S. § I I -105 !(B).  The officer shall, consistent with department policies, \ndocument the justification for such a decision in the stop data collection system.  Factors to \nconsider that may indicate an immigration inquiry could hinder or obstruct an investigation may \ninclude the need for suspect, victim, and witness cooperation in any investigation. \nVI.  Immigration Violations \nIf an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed a civil \nimmigration violation, the officer has no authority to arrest the individual and shall not detain the \nindividual longer than necessary to complete the state law basis for the contact. 5 See Melendres, \n695 F.3d at 1001 (any extension of a lawful stop \"must be supported by additional suspicion of \ncriminality.  Unlawful presence is not criminal.\"). \nIf an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed a federal \ncriminal immigration violation, the officer may arrest the individual and contact ICE/CBP to \nclarify its interest in detaining the individual. 6 See Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1001 (citing Gonzales \nv. City ofP  eoria, 722 F.2d 468,475 (9th Cir. 1983), for the proposition that \"'federal law does \nnot preclude local law enforcement of the criminal provisions' of federal immigration law.\"). \nOfficers may wait a reasonable time period for ICE/CBP response and should document any \nresponse or direction from ICE/CBP.  If ICE/CBP fails to respond or take disposition within a \nreasonable amount oftime and there is no other criminal violation, the officer shall release the \nindividual. \nlfiCE/CBP agrees to take disposition oft he individual, officers may assist by transporting \nthe individual to an ICE/CBP facility ifiCE/CBP so directs. A.R.S. § I I -105 1(0). When making \nthe determination to transport, officers shall, consistent with department policies, consider \ndepartment and division priorities. \nOfficers  shall  not  arrest  an  individual  simply because  the  individual  lacks  proper \ndocumentation.  See Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1000-01. \nVII.  Arrests \nAn officer or jail official shall not prolong an arrest or detention for an immigration \ninquiry, including to request or obtain verification of immigration status. Arizona, I 32 S.Ct. at \n2509 (\"Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional \nconcerns.\"). \n5 This restriction on non-federallaw enforcement does not apply where such officials have been \nspecifically trained and delegated to exercise the authority of an immigration officer under \n§ 287(g) ofthe INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g), and are acting pursuant to that authority.  Melendres, \n695 F.3d at 1001. \n6 It remains an open issue whether reasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigration \ncrime would be a basis for prolonging a detention.  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2509. \n5 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1300   Filed 09/19/16   Page 9 of 10\nIf, after reviewing all available facts (except race or ethnicity) and/or evidence, an officer \nhas reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable \nattempt shall be made to contact ICE/CBP to verify the arrestee's immigration status prior to \nreleasing the arrestee, but release may not be delayed in order to request or obtain verification. \nId.  The presumptions and the exceptions in section V above apply to this paragraph.  Officers \nshall, consistent with department policies, document any response or direction from ICE/CBP in \nthe stop data collection system. \nThe officer shall proceed to handle the arrestee according to department policy, which \nmay result in the issuance of a citation, referral, and the release of the arrestee. \nVIII.  Contact with ICE/CBP \nOfficers attempting to verify an individual's immigration status shall do so by contacting \nOperational Communications. Operational Communications shall submit an inquiry through the \nNational  Law  Enforcement Telecommunications  System  (NLETS)  for  verification  of an \nindividual's immigration status.  After a response is received from ICE/CBP, Operational \nCommunications shall forward  the information to the officer.  If information verifying an \nindividual's immigration status is received from another source (such as an ICE/CBP officer on \nscene), the verification shall, consistent with department policies, be documented in the stop data \ncollection system. \nIf an officer wishes to request verification prior to the release of an individual or arrestee, \nOperational Communications may follow the NLETS submission with a phone call to the Law \nEnforcement Support Center (LESC). 7 As explained above, however, officers may not extend a \nstop or detention in order to make a verification request or to wait for a verification response. \nIX.  Consular Notification \nOfficers  should  follow  consular  notification  procedures  set  forth  in  the  Vienna \nConvention on Consular Relations (the Convention), see Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on \nConsular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970]21 U.S.T. 77, 100-101, T.I.A.S. No. 6820, namely, \n\"when a national of one country is detained by authorities in another, the authorities must notify \nthe consular officers of the detainee's home country if the detainee so requests.\" Sanchez-Llamas \nv.  Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 339 (2006) (\"[Article 36 of the Convention] provides that 'if he so \nrequests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular \npost of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or \ncommitted to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner.\"').  Law \nenforcement officials may refer to the following for guidance on such notification procedures: \nLaw Bulletin 2009-05, Foreign Nationals-Advice ofR ights in Addition to Miranda Warnings; the \n7  \"ICE's LESC operates '24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year' and provides, \namong other things, 'immigration status, identity information and real-time assistance to local, \nstate and federal law enforcement agencies.'\"  Arizona,  132 S. Ct. at 2508 (internal citations \nomitted). \n6 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01061-SRB   Document 1300   Filed 09/19/16   Page 10 of 10\nU.S. Department of State's Consular Notification and Access Manual, (Fourth ed. 2016), \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/dam/travel/CNAtrainingresources/CNA Manual  4th Edition  Au \ngust2016.pdf (last visited 9/13/16). 8 \n8 This infonnal opinion does not confer upon aliens any legal rights beyond those recognized by binding \ncourt precedent. See Sanchez-Llamasv. Oregon, 126 S. Ct. at2681 (\"Indeed, Article 36 [of Vienna \nConvention on Consular Relations] does not guarantee defendants any assistance at all.  The \nprovision secures only a right of foreign nationals to have their consulate informed oft heir arrest \nor detention-not to have their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement authorities cease \ntheir investigation pending any such notice or intervention.\"). \n7 ",
