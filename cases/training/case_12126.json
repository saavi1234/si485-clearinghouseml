At argument, Movants indicated that they would not object to redactions of certain information in the Videos. Defendants, for their part, indicated that they would not object to the unsealing of at least one of the Videos. With that understanding, the court is inclined to grant Movants motionsto unseal, subject to the following: Defendants shall, within 21 days of the date of this Order, lodge with the court a set of edited Videos pixelated, cropped, or otherwise redacted to the minimum extent necessary to address any privacy or security concerns (the Edited Videos). Such alterations shall not obscure or diminish any depictions of uses of force. Plaintiffs and Defendants may lodge, along with the set of Edited Videos, a Joint Statement providing additional contextual information about any or all of the Videos. Although the court prefers that Plaintiffs and Defendants agree on any such commentary, the parties may, if necessary, submit separate additional statements. The court then anticipates issuing an Order releasing the Edited Videos shortly thereafter. IT IS SO ORDERED. (shb) (Entered: 09/12/2023)"

    "summary": "<p>On January 18, 2012, prisoners at the Los Angeles County Jail filed this class action in the U.S. Court for the Central District of California. The prisoners sued the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department (LASD) under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The prisoners, represented by the ACLU of Southern California, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, they claimed that violence by LASD deputies&mdash;\"sadistic beat[ing]\" of incarcerated people that included \"broken legs, fractured eye sockets, shattered jaws, broken teeth, severe head injuries, nerve damage, dislocated joints, collapsed lungs, and wounds requiring dozens of stitches and 22 staples\"&mdash;violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>This case's origins lie in the landmark case <a href=\"../../../../case/12126/\"><em>Rutherford v. Block</em></a>. That case resulted in the appointment of a special master to monitor and report reform efforts in the Los Angeles Jail system. The 30 semiannual reports submitted in that litigation highlight the illegal treatment of mentally ill detainees and the incidences of violence in the Los Angeles Jail system.</p>\r\n<p>The ACLU also submitted annual reports on the Los Angeles County Jail system in the <em>Rutherford</em> litigation. Its reports alleged the rise of a gang of deputies who were supervising the jail. The plaintiffs alleged that this gang, the \"3000 boys,\" incited and committed violence against prisoners, and competed with other jail deputy gangs for control of the jail, involving the prisoners in their struggle for control. Members of the gang were said to have a \"3000\" tattoo on the back of their necks.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs in this case cited reports from prisoners, ACLU reports, and quotes from the Los Angeles sheriff that confirmed the existence of the gang, though the activities of the gang were disputed. The plaintiffs also alleged that a culture of violence had taken root in the county jail, citing multiple incidences of mentally ill prisoners being beaten and men being beaten for witnessing other beatings. The plaintiffs also alleged that several of these beatings resulted in disciplinary segregation for the victims. Other incidents were witnessed by chaplains, in-jail educators, and visitors. The plaintiffs described taunting and beatings that were racially motivated, disproportionately affected the mentally ill, and constituted punishment for perceived slights rather than violations of jail policy. They also claimed that prisoners conferring with the ACLU were targeted in particular. There were 51 specific incidents set forth in the complaint that occurred in 2010&ndash;2011, however the plaintiffs alleged that the violence had been ongoing for at least 12 years.</p>\r\n<p>On June 7, 2012, the Court (Judge Dean Pregerson) issued an unpublished order that certified the plaintiff class and denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss. 2012 WL 2061694 (C.D. Cal. June 7, 2012). Then, the parties continued with discovery and entered into settlement talks from 2012&ndash;2015.</p>\r\n<p>On January 6, 2015, both parties filed a joint motion for a settlement. The settlement was approved in April 2015. Under the settlement agreement, the Sheriff's Department agreed to adopt a detailed and far-reaching plan to reform department policies and practices on use of force. A panel of three court-appointed experts, who were assigned to write the plan, also monitored the department's compliance with all aspects of the remedial plan. The defendants agreed to pay $950,000 in attorneys' fees and to pay reasonable attorneys' fees for ongoing work to ensure compliance with the settlement up to $30,000 per year. The plaintiffs' attorneys also acted as monitors. The settlement included enhanced training in use of force for all deputies and methods for tracking and review of use of force incidents and detainees' complaints and grievances. To apply to the court for termination of the agreement consistent with the PLRA, the defendant had to maintain compliance for 18 months as monitored by the panel.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2015, the Court (Judge Dean Pregerson) approved the settlement and dismissed the case. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>The case was later reassigned to Judge Michael R. Wilner in 2016. Judge Wilner issued an order governing the disclosure of records following his appointment on June 17, 2016. Following the approval of the settlement until May 31, 2019, the panel of monitors filed five reports evaluating the defendant&rsquo;s compliance with the settlement action plan. In compiling the reports, the panel spoke with detainees and met with the Sheriff, the Department&rsquo;s Inmate Grievance Coordinator, and the Inmate Grievance Teams.</p>\r\n<p>After the second report, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement in September 2017. The parties stipulated to continuing the motion and hearings on the motion for the next year and half, until it was withdrawn by the plaintiffs in May 2018. Judge Wilner granted attorneys' fees in the amount of $60,000 for work performed in 2015 and 2016 by the class attorneys on October 19, 2017. The panel has filed nine reports in total as of April 4, 2022. The ninth report, filed on June 30, 2021, cited a further decrease in the amount of incidences where force was used. The panel did note an ongoing concern about problematic uses of force, such as for corporal or discipline punishment uses. The panel regarded these instances as outliers, but recommended that special attention be paid to situations where use of force seemed to be motivated by retribution. The case is ongoing as of April 4, 2022.&nbsp;</p>",

JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  l.  This action is brought pursuant to the Eighth and Fourteenth \n3  Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This \n4  Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.c. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). \n5  2.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the \n6  Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 139l. \n7  II.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n8  3.  Plaintiffs Alex Rosas and Jonathan Goodwin are inmates in the \n9  custody of Sheriff Leroy Baca in the Los Angeles County Jails.  Rosas and \n10  Goodwin have been beaten and threatened with violence by deputies of the Los \n11  Angeles County Sheriff's Department (the \"Department\" or \"LASD\").  Mr. Rosas \n12  and Mr. Goodwin have also witnessed deputies beating other inmates.  The abuse \n13  that Rosas and Goodwin suffered and witnessed is typical of the abuse inflicted by \n14  deputies on countless other inmates in the jails, and is part of a pattern and practice \n15  of deputy-on-inmate violence that has persisted for many years.  In the last few \n16  years alone, there have been dozens of documented cases of extreme and unjustified \n17  violence by deputies against inmates.  Defendants are aware of the culture of \n18  deputy violence that pervades the Jails but have failed to take reasonable measures \n19  to remedy the problem.  Plaintiffs charge Sheriff Leroy Baca, Undersheriff Paul \n20  Tanaka, Assistant Sheriff Cecil Rhambo, and Chief of Custody Operations \n21  Department Dennis Bums! with violations of Plaintiffs' Eighth and Fourteenth \n22  Amendment rights to reasonable protection from violence and excessive force. \n23  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and other current and future \n24  inmates in the Los Angeles County Jails, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. \n25 \n26  ! \"Defendants\" collectively refers to Leroy Baca (\"Sheriff Baca\"), Paul Tanalca \n(\"Undersheriff Tanaka\"), Cecil Rhambo (\"Assistant Sheriff Rhambo\"), and Dennis \n27  Bums (\"Chief Bums\").  Defendants are Los Angeles County officials responsible \nforpohcies governing the conduct ofLASD deputies and for the safety oIthe \n28  inmates in their custody in the Los Angeles County Jails. \n-1- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  4.  Los Angeles County has the largest jail system in the world, \n2  with an average daily population of approximately 15,000 inmates.  The great \n3  majority ofthe inmates are pre-trial detainees who are not being held pursuant to a \n4  criminal conviction.  Large numbers of inmates in the jails have not committed, and \n5  are not charged with, with violent offenses.  There are inmates held in the jails on \n6  Immigration & Customs Enforcement (rCE) holds, charges of public intoxication, \n7  traffic violations, and warrants for failure to appear on a wide variety of minor \n8  offenses.2  Indeed a number of the inmates whose beatings are described in this \n9  complaint were being detained on non-violent misdemeanors, improper warrants \n10  and other minor offenses.  See paragraphs 71-72, 161.  Deputy violence against \n11  inmates in the Los Angeles County Jails is commonplace, but it is especially \n12  pervasive in three facilities that comprise a single complex on Bauchet Street in \n13  downtown Los Angeles:  Men's Central Jail, Twin Towers Correctional Facility \n14  (\"TTCF\") and the Inmate Reception Center (\"IRC\") (collectively, \"the Jails\"). \n15  5.  Inmates in the Jails live in fear of deputy violence.  It is typical \n16  for deputies to subject unresisting inmates to grossly excessive force by slamming \n17  inmates' heads into walls, punching them in the face with their fists, kicking them \n18  with their boots, and shooting them multiple times with their tasers - and for these \n19  beatings to result in serious injuries to the inmates, including broken legs, fractured \n20  eye sockets, shattered jaws, broken teeth, severe head injuries, nerve damage, \n21  dislocated joints, collapsed lungs, and wounds requiring dozens of stitches and \n22  staples.  Deputies sadistically beat inmates with serious mental illness.  They have \n23  beaten inmates who are already in fragile medical condition, including inmates in \n24  wheelchairs.  Deputies have beaten inmates for asking for medical treatment,· for \n25 \n26 \nLos Angeles County Jail Overcrowding Reduction Report, at xvi Vera Institute of \n2 \nJustice, September 2011 (\"Vera staff observed arraignments for people who spent \n27  one or two nights in jail for FTA on charges of not paying a $1.50 metro fare.  Vera \nwas told that some judicial officers routinely set bail at $50,000 for one FTA, and \n28 \njail sentences for FTA for jay walking and failure to pay traffic fines.\"). \n-2- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  the color oftheir skin, or for no apparent reason at all.  Deputies also enlist and \n2  encourage other inmates to carry out savage attacks. \n3  6.  Many of the beatings that routinely occur in the jails are far \n4  more severe than the infamous 1991 beating of Rodney King by members of the \n5  Los Angeles Police Department.  The violence is not the work of a few rogue \n6  deputies.  Rather, it is a systemic problem that has continued unchecked for \n7  decades. \n8  7.  Many deputies belong to gangs inside the Jails.  Like members \n9  of street gangs, these deputies sport tattoos to signal their gang membership.  They \n10  beat up inmates to gain prestige among their peers, and \"earn their ink\" by breaking \n11  inmates' bones.  They seek to control the Jails, and to a significant degree they do \n12  control the areas where they work. \n13  8.  The \"3000 Boys\" is one such deputy gang, named for the third \n14  floor of Men's Central Jail where its members work.  Members ofthe 3000 Boys, \n15  who sport a \"3000\" tattoo on the backs of their necks, inflict violence on inmates, \n16  foment violence among inmates, and even deploy violence on other deputies who \n17  resist their abusive practices.  A similar deputy gang operates on the second floor of \n18  Men's Central Jail.  On information and belief, members of the \"2000 Boys\" \n19  designate their gang membership with tattoos of a Roman numeral \"II\" on their \n20  legs.  Violent deputy gangs have operated in the LASD at least since the 1980s and \n21  perhaps since the early 1970s.  The 3000 Boys and 2000 Boys have been operating \n22  with Defendants' knowledge and acquiescence. \n23  9.  Defendants' ongoing failure to halt these abuses has \n24  communicated to the deputy gangs that they can carry out brutal assaults on inmates \n25  with impunity.  In fact, Defendants' permissiveness has so emboldened the deputy \n26  gangs that they have begun to carry out their brutal assaults on inmates more and \n27  more openly, and even in the presence of civilian volunteer workers in the Jails. \n28  Jail chaplains and the court-appointed jail monitors of the American Civil Liberties \n-3 - COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  Union (\"ACLU\") have provided eyewitness accounts of deputies beating non-\n2  resisting inmates in the Jails. \n3  10.  There is a widespread fear among inmates of reporting deputy \n4  misdeeds to the ACLU or anyone else, because deputies regularly retaliate against \n5  those who lodge complaints, with beatings, strip searches, body cavity searches, \n6  destructive cell shake-downs, confiscation of belongings, and trumped-Up \n7  disciplinary and criminal charges. \n8  11.  Defendants and all ofthe high-ranking officials in the \n9  Department are aware - and, in the case of at least three of them, have been .aware \n10  for years - of the pattern of deputy violence, intimidation, and retaliation against \n11  inmates.  It has been publicly reported, documented, and conde=ed on scores of \n12  occasions during the past twenty years.  Starting in 2006, a captain and a now-\nl3  retired commander, both in the custody division, have reported to Defendants \n14  problems with deputy gangs and deputies using excessive and unnecessary force, \n15  but Defendants did not take appropriate steps to address the problem.  Sheriff Baca, \n16  Undersheriff Tanaka, Chief Bums, and other supervisors in these jails and at the \n17  highest levels of the Department have acquiesced in, fostered, and implicitly \n18  authorized the abuse by failing to promulgate adequate policies on the use of force, \n19  failing to adequately train and supervise deputies in the face of historical and \n20  continued evidence of abuse, failing to conduct meaningful investigations of reports \n21  of excessive force, failing to hold guilty deputies accountable, and ignoring \n22  evidence that deputies and other Department officials are covering up incidents of \n23  excessive force. \n24  12.  In 1992, the prestigious Kolts Commission - formed at the \n25  behest of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to conduct a review of the \n26  policies, practices, and procedures ofthe Sheriffs Department - issued a scathing \n27  repolt documenting numerous incidents of excessive force, lax discipline, and the \n28  presence of deputy gangs.  The Kolts Report resulted in the appointment of Special \n-4-\nCOMPLAlNT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  Counsel to the Board of Supervisors for Oversight of the Sheriffs Department, \n2  Merrick Bobb.  Bobb issued 30 semi-annual reports between 1993 and 2011.  The \n3  County:s Office of Independent Review (\"OIR\"), headed by Michael Gennaco, has \n4  repeatedly reported incidents of serious abuse to SheriffBaca.  The ACLU, which \n5  serves as class counsel to all detainees in Los Angeles County Jails in Rutherford v. \n6  Baca, No. 75-04111 (CD. Cal.), and which has been appointed by the District \n7  Court in that case to monitor conditions in the Los Angdes County Jails, has \n8  submitted multiple reports to SheriffBaca over several years, documenting more \n9  than 70 cases of extreme deputy-on-inmate violence. \n10  13.  Despite SheriffBaca's actual knowledge of this pattern of \n11  violence and cover-ups, he has failed over a period of many years to take \n12  reasonable measures to halt the abuses.  Even now that the pervasiveness and the \n13  extraordinary brutality of the deputy-on-inmate abuse has become common \n14  knowledge through the release of reports by the ACLU, SheriffBaca has left in \n15  place his principal subordinates in charge of supervising the Custody Division of \n16  the Sheriffs Department, Undersheriff Paul Tanaka and Chief Burns, who have \n17  day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the inmates' safety, and under whose regime \n18  this pattern of abuse has flourished. \n19  14.  The ultimate goal of this lawsuit is to end the longstanding \n20  pattern of deputy-on-inmate abuse by requiring Defendants to put in place a system \n21  of accountability, which they have for so long failed to do.  That system must \n22  include, at nUnimum, adequate policies on the use of force, proper training on the \n23  policies, proper supelvision of deputies, thorough review of use of force incidents, \n24  and appropriate discipline for improper use of force or failure to report its use. \n25  Ill.  PARTIES \n26  15.  Plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin are inmates in the custody of the \n27  LASD who were previously housed in Men's Central Jail and are currently housed \n28  in Twin Towers.  Plaintiffs have been subjected to deputy violence and threats of \n-5- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  violence and they have witnessed deputies violently abusing other inmates.  They \n2  are at continuing risk of being subjected to deputy violence as a result of \n3  Defendants' acts and omissions. \n4  16.  Defendant Leroy Baca has been the Shetiff of Los Angeles \n5  County since 1998.  As Sheriff, he is the chief executive officer of the LASD.  By \n6  California law, the Sheriff is answerable for the safekeeping of the inmates in his \n7  custody.  CaL Gov't Code §§ 26605,26610; Cal. Penal Code § 4006.  SheriffBaca \n8  is responsible for the management and control of all Los Angeles County Jails, and \n9  for all matters relating to the selection, supervision, promotion, training, and \n10  discipline of the unifonned staff, including the supervisory security staff, of the \n11  County Jails.  He is also responsible for the care, custody, and control of all inmates \n12  housed in the County Jails.  Sheriff Baca is regularly provided with reports of \n13  applications offorce, allegations of unreported and excessive use offorce, and \n14  other breaches of security in the County Jails.  Plaintiffs sue Sheri ff Baca in his \n15  official capacity. \n16  17.  Defendant Paul Tanaka is Undersheriff of the LASD.  He serves \n17  as second-in-command of the Department and oversees its daily operations.  Along \n18  with Sheriff Baca, Undersheriff Tanaka is also responsible for the care, custody, \n19  and control of all inmates housed in the County Jails.  Plaintiffs sue Undersheriff \n20  Tanaka in his official capacity. \n21  18.  Defendant Cecil Rhambo is one of two Assistant Sheriffs of the \n22  LASD.  He oversees the leadership of the Department's Custody Division, among \n23  other responsibilities.  Plaintiffs sue Assistant SheriffRhambo in his official \n24  capacity. \n25  19.  Defendant Dennis Burns has been employed by the LASD for \n26  more than 36 years.  He is currently assigned as the Chief of the Custody \n27  Operations Division which, along with the Correctional Services Division, is \n28  responsible for the operation of the County Jails.  The responsibilities of the \n-6- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  Custody Operations Division include the tracking of violent incidents and the \n2  formulation of responses designed to protect the personal safety of Department staff \n3  and inmates in its custody.  He has formerly served as Captain ofthe LASD's \n4  Internal Affairs Bureau (\"IAB\"), which is responsible for conducting administrative \n5  investigations against Department members who have engaged in misconduct by \n6  violating the Department's policies and procedures.  Plaintiffs sue Chief Burns in \n7  his official capacity. \n8  20.  All Defendants are sued in their official capacities for \n9  declaratory and injunctive relief.  At all times referred to in this complaint, \n10  Defendants were acting within the scope of their employment as employees of the \n11  Department, and acting under color of state and municipal law. \n12  IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n13  A.  There Is A Longstanding, Pervasive, And Notorious Culture, \n14  Pattern, And Practice Of Deputy Violence Against Inmates In The \n15  Los Angeles County Jails \n16  21.  There is a longstanding pattern and practice in the Los Angeles \n17  County Jails, and particularly in the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles, of \n18  deputy-on-inmate violence and deputy-instigated inmate-on-inmate abuse. \n19  Multiple oversight and monitoring agencies, including the U.S. Department of \n20  Justice, the LASD's OIR, the Special Counsel to the Los Angeles County Board of \n21  Supervisors for oversight of the Sheriffs Department, and the ACLU, have issued \n22  reports on the use of excessive force and other abuses by the LASD against the \n23  inmates in its custody and in many cases made recommendations to address the \n24  problem. \n25  22.  According to Thomas Parker, a former FBI agent and Assistant \n26  Special Agent in Charge ofthe Bureau's Los Angeles Field Office, who oversaw \n27  the FBI investigation into the force, \"There is at least a two-decade history of \n28  corruption within the ranks of the LASD .... [NJo one at the command level ... \n-7-  COMPLAINT FOR INmNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  appears to have been held accountable and appropriately punished for failure to \n2  properly supervise and manage their subordinate personnel and resources.  In my \n3  opinion, this has provided the 'seedbed' for continued lax supervision, violence, \n4  and corruption within LASD and the cOlmty jails it administers.\"  Sheriff Baca and \n5  other LASD officials have \"essentially abdicated their responsibilities to provide a \n6  safe, secure, and corruption-free incarceration environment within the Los Angeles \n7  County Jail System.\"  The result, Mr. Parker concluded, is a pattern of inmates \n8  \"suffering severe injuries, maiming, and death, some caused by fellow inmates, but \n9  most often at the hands of, or with the acquiescence or assistance of, the deputy \n10  sheriffs who are their keepers.\"  Mr. Parker states, \"I have never experienced any \n11  facility exhibiting the volume and repetitive patterns of violence, misfeasance, and \n12  malfeasance impacting the Los Angeles County Jail system.\" \n13  23.  In May 1990, the Los Angeles Times published an investigative \n14  report disclosing that excessive force cases represented three-fourths of all major \n15  legal settlements and jury awards over a three-year period; that half of the deputies \n16  involved in major cases had been sued in the past for brutality; and that one training \n17  officer had been sued ten times in ten years.  The newspaper quoted sources \n18  familiar with the Department who claimed that a code of silence made deputies \n19  reluctant to testify against fellow officers, even those who repeatedly used \n20  excessive force.  The Department kept no separate records ofthe deputies who were \n21  sued for excessive force or the outcomes of the suits.3 \n22  24.  In 1989, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors formed a \n23  blue-ribbon commission to conduct a review of \"the policies, practices and \n24 \nMerrick Bobb, Police Assessment Resource Center (\"P ARC\"), 10th Semiannual \n3 \n25  Report 12 (Feb. 1999), available at \nhttp://www.parc.info/client  files/LASDIl Oth%20Semiannual%20Report.pdf (citing \n26  Daryl Kelley & Victor Merlna, Alleged Brutality by Deputies Costs County:  law \nEnJorcement:  Excessive-Force Lawsuits Have Nearly Doubled in Recent Years. \n27  SheriffB  lock Stands by Department Policies and His Officers, Los Angeles Times, \nMay\"17, 1990, at AI, available at http://articles.latimes.comlI990-05-27/news/mn-\n28  514_1_e xcessive-force). \n-8- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  procedures ofthe Sheriffs Department, including recruitment, training, job \n2  performance and evaluation, record keeping and management practices, as they \n3  relate to allegations of excessive force, the community sensitivity of deputies and \n4  the Department's citizen complaint procedure.\"  The Board of Supervisors \n5  appointed the late Judge James G. Kolts (\"Kolts\") as Special Counsel to the Board. \n6  Kolts was a former star prosecutor and a highly respected former Los Angeles \n7  County Superior Court judge.  The team Kolts assembled for this project became \n8  known as the Kolts Commission.  In July 1992, after an extensive investigation, the \n9  Kolts Commission issued a scathing 359-page report (the \"Kolts Report,,).4  The \n10  Kolts Report detailed a history of excessive use of force and lax discipline within \n11  the LASD, and concluded that the Department had failed to reform itself.  The \n12  Commission recommended civilian monitoring ofthe LASD.5 \n13  25.  In January 1993, the Board of Supervisors passed a resolution to \n14  carry out the recommendations of the Kolts Commission, and the Board retained \n15  Special Counsel, Merrick J. Bobb, to monitor LASD's compliance with the Kolts \n16  Report and to report to the Board semi-annually regarding such compliance.6  Bobb \n17  continues to serve to this day as Special Counsel to the Los Angeles County Board \n18  of Supervisors, and remains the Board of Supervisors' monitor of the LASD and its \n19  operations.7 \n20  26.  In his fourth Semiannual Report, dated June 1995, Special \n21  Counsel Bobb repOt1ed the following: \n22  27.  \"[W]e continued to find too many cases involving unnecessary \n23  force in responses to verbal taunts or passive noncompliance.

In a 1997 letter from the Acting Assistant Attorney General of \n18  the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOl\") to the then-Los \n19  Angeles County Executive, Joa=e Sturges, the DOJ reported that \"Inmates who are \n20  mentally ill or housed in mental health housing are subject to an unacceptably high \n21  risk of physical abuse and other mistreatment at the hands of other inmates and \n22  custodial staff.

We agree with \n6  Special Counsel Merrick Bobb's finding that in the Jail 'there is callous treatment \n7  [of inmates] at times, a problem that LASD management knows about but has not \n8  acted sufficiently aggressively to resolve.,,,13  Furthermore, \"[t]he Jail's failure to \n9  investigate promptly and thoroughly allegations of abuse against mentally ill \n10  inmates, and its failure to take appropriate action in response to incidents of abuse, \n11  enables the abuse of these inmates to continue.,,14  The report also stated, \"The \n12  treatment received by one inmate indicates that excessive use of force and physical \n13  mistreatment of inmates with mental illnesses may be in part the result of \n14  inadequate training.\" 15 \n15  31.  In his tenth Semiannual Report, dated February 1999, Special \n16  Counsel Bobb pointed to a long list of recent crises on the custody side of the \n17  Department, including \"troubling inmate deaths at the hands of custody \n18  personnel[,]\" \"inmate on inmate violence[,]\" and \"vigilante-1i1ee behavior at Twin \n19  Towers.,,16 \n20  32.  On December 19, 2002, the Los Angeles County and the United \n21  States entered into a Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Mental Health \n22  Services at the Los Angeles County Jail (\"MOA,,).J7  Sheriff Baca was one of the \n23  signers of the MOA, which was entered into \"to avoid potential litigation \n24 \nId. at 17-18 (citing Merrick Bobb, PA  RC, 6th Semiannual Report 11-13 (Sept. \n13 \n25  19%)). \n14 rd. at 21. \nra: \n26 \n15  at 18. \n16 KIerrick Bobb, supra note 2, at 17. \n27  17 Memorandum of Agreement Between the United States and Los Angeles County, \nCalifornia Regarding Mental Health Services at the Los Angeles CountY.

In March 2003, the US DOl sent to County Counsel a \n6  compliance letter on the 2002 MOA about treatment of the mentally ill.  The letter \n7  concluded that the Sheriffs Department was not in compliance with the \n8  requirement of the MOA that LASD \"provide mandatory orientation and continuing \n9  competency-based training for correctional staff in the identification and custodial \n10  care of mentally ill inmates including, but not necessarily limited to \n11  a.  interpreting or responding to bizarre or aberrant behaviors, \n12  b.  recognizing and responding to indications of suicidal thoughts, \n13  c.  proper suicide observation, \n14  d.  recognizing common side effects of psychotropic medications, \n15  e.  professional and humane treatment of mentally ill inmates, and \n16  f.  response to mental health crises including suicide intervention \n17  and cell extractions.\" \n18  34.  In November 2004, Special Counsel Merrick Bobb presented to \n19  SheriffBaca and the Board of Supervisors a confidential report finding that \"Los \n20  Angeles County's largest jail is so outdated, understaffed and riddled with security \n21  flaws that it jeopardizes the lives of guards and inmates. ,,20  The report concluded \n22  that Men's Central Jail suffers from \"lax supervision and a long-standing jail \n23  culture that has shortchanged accountability for inmate safety and security.,,21 \n24 \nId. \nIS ra. \n25  19 \n20 Jack Leonard & Richard Winton, L.A.

In his nineteenth Semia=ual Report, dated February 2005, \n2  Special Counsel Merrick Bobb noted: \n3  From  the  Kolts  Report  onward,  there  has  been  a \n4  paradoxical  contradiction  between  Internal  Affairs \n5  investigations  that  exonerated the  officer  and  litigation \n6  arising  out  of the  same  incident  that  cost  the  County \n7  substantial  money  in  settlement and judgments.  Those \n8  same disparities continue to exist after 2003 and 2004 .... \n9  While  at  times  one  might  find  instances  in  which  the \n10  County's  lawyers  have  unwisely  settled,  it is  far  more \n1 1  common to find cases where the LASD let an officer off \n12  the hook when a judge or jury would not.  We can only \n13  say as we have in the past that these disparities \"fuell] the \n14  fire of those who would strip the Sheriff of the privilege \n15  of investigating  and  disciplining  his  own  employees.\" \n16  (citing the Fifteenth Semiannual Report at 73).22 \n17  36.  In June 2008 the ACLU issued a report by Dr. Terry Kupers, an \n23 \n18  expert on mental illness among incarcerated populations. The report was filed in \n19  the Rutherford litigation, served on SheriffBaca's counsel, and sent directly to a \n20  number of high-ranking officials in-the LASD Custody Division.  In his report \n21  Dr. Kupers made a number of conclusions including:  \"[A]t the Los Angeles \n22  County Jail the claims by prisoners [of abuse by deputies] are so widespread, and \n23  the reports of abuse so consistent among multiple reporters, that is seems very \n24  likely there is an unacceptably high incidence of custodial abuse.

Dr. Kupers also made numerous recommendations to address \n12  the serious problems he found with the treatment of mentally ill prisoners including \nl3  that \"[a]ll officers ... be required to undergo intensive training in working with \n14  prisoners with mental illness\" and that jail officials \"halt custodial abuse\" by \n15  implementing \"zero tolerance from the top, education for prisoners about their \n16  rights and the grievance process, training and support to encourage staff to report \n17  abuse by other staff, a confidential complaint system that fosters prisoner trust and \n18  action, and prompt and thorough investigation with appropriate consequences for \n19  offending staff.,,28 \n20  38.  In April 2010, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy, Joshua \n21  Sather, who had graduated at the top of his recruit class, resigned after only a few \n22  weeks on the job, alleging that a supervisor made him beat up a mentally ill jail \n23  inmate.  Sather was the sole Honor Recruit in his graduating class from the \n24  academy, and had been recognized for his leadership and other abilities.  As with \n25  virtually all rookies, his first assignment was jail duty.

At some point \n2  during Sather's shift, he, his supervisor and other deputies used force on a mentally \n3  ill inmate.  Soon afterward, Sather, crying and distraught, called his uncle, a veteran \n4  Sheriff's detective, and told him that he had participated in an unjustified beating, \n5  that shortly before the beating his supervisor said, \"We're go=a go in and teach \n6  this guy a lesson,\" and that the attack had been covered up.  Sather's uncle \n7  confronted the supervisor about making his nephew \"beat up 'dings.  Sheriff's \n\",29 \n8  officials launched an investigation and determined that an uncooperative inmate \n9  had been subdued by force, but concluded that no misconduct had occurred. \n10  39.  In May 2010, the ACLU National Prison Project and the ACLU \n11  of Southern California submitted to SheriffBaca and to the Rutherford Court the \n12  ACLU's \"Annual Report on Conditions Inside Los Angeles County Jail- 2008-\n13  2009. ,,30  The report included declarations documenting scores of complaints from \n14  inmates and their families about deputy-inflicted injuries, ranging from broken ribs \n15  and black eyes to severe head wounds that required staples.  The report also \n16  documented a persistent pattern of retaliation and threats of retaliation by deputies \n17  against inmates who protested the conditions of their confmement. \n18  40.  In September 2010, the ACLU National Prison Project and the \n19  ACLU of Southern California submitted to Sheriff Baca and filed with the \n20  Rutherford Court the ACLU's \"Interim Report on Conditions in the Los Angeles \n21  County Jails.\")1  That report stated: \n22  Robert Faturechi, L.A.

During the first eight months of2010, the \n4  violence  has  continued  unahated.  One  aspect  of the \n5  violence we discussed  in our 2009 report was  deputies' \n6  use of excessive and unjustified force, which continues to \n7  date:  in the  five-month period from  March 10 through \n8  August 10, 2010, we received more than 70 complaints of \n9  excessive  and/or  unjustified  force,  or  retaliation  by \n10  deputies  against  prisoners,  or  both.  Twenty  of  the \n11  prisoners making these complaints have provided us with \n12  sworn written statements.32 \n13  41.  In December 20 I 0, the media reported on a large-scale brawl at \n14  an LASD Christmas party at a banquet hall in Montebello.  The brawl was between \n15  members ofthe 3000 Boys (the deputy gang discussed above in Paragraph 8) and \n16  other deputies who worked in Men's Central Jail.  In commenting publicly on the \n17  incident, Sheriff Baca characterized it as the \"drunkenness of a few bad apples,\" \n18  and opined that cops \"know how to take care of themselves,\" and that they need to \n19  \"man up and say, 'I'm not a wimp. '\"  Sheriff Baca insisted that \"the core of what \n20  occurred with these 3000 boys ... wasn't their tattoo.  It wasn't their unit.  It was \n21  their friendship and their drinking.,,33 \n22  42.  The OIR, however, disagreed, stating, \"Perhaps most concerning \n23  is the evidence that jail supervisors apparently knew about the use of 'gang-like' \n24  signs and other troubling behavior well before the emption of violence at the \n25  Christmas party. ,,34 \n26  Id. at 3. \n32 \nKTLA Sf-eCial Report: The Gang Behind the Badge?

On September 25, 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \n2  FBI was conducting a criminal investigation into deputy abuse at the Jails.35 \n3  44.  On September 28,2011, the ACLU filed an Annual Report in \n4  Rutherford v. Baca, reporting seventy cases of extreme deputy abuse in the \n5  previous year, including accounts by civilian eyewitnesses of savage deputy \n36 \n6  beatings of inmates in the Jails.\n7  45.  On October 13, 2011, the OIR issued a report stating that the \n8  Sheriffs Department has failed over many years to follow through on proposals to \n9  address violence in the Jails.37 \n10  46.  In early December 2011, Robert Olmsted, a retired top LASD \n11  official who had been the Captain in charge of Men's Central Jail before being \n12  promoted to Commander in the LASD's Custody Division, and who oversaw both \n13  Men's Central Jail and Twin Towers, publicly disclosed that Sheriff Baca and other \n14  senior Department staff, including Defendants Tanaka and Bums, have long had \n15  actual knowledge of the pattern of widespread deputy violence in the Jails. \n16  Olmsted had repeatedly informed Defendants Baca, Tanaka, and Bums of such \n17  problems, and tried to raise red flags about shoddy investigations that allowed \n18  deputies to escape scrutiny for using force.  Olmsted had also voiced concerns to \n19  them about deputies forming gang-like aggressive cliques.  Chief Bums told \n20  Olmsted that it was impossible to change the deputy culture in Men's Central Jail. \n21  Sheriff Baca never followed up with Commander Olmsted after he twice \n22  approached him about problems in Men's Central Jail.

On January 10,2012 Sheriff Baca testified to the Board of \n2  Supervisors that use of force often arises when inmates have been declassified from \n3  mental health housing in TTCF Tower 1 to be returned to Men's Central Jail.  This \n4  practice of improperly declassifying mentally ill inmates from mental health \n5  housing in Tower 1 and placing them in general population in MCJ is one that \n6  Dr. Kupers identified almost four years earlier as resulting in the abuse of mentally \n7  ill inmates. \n8  48.  On January 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \n9  Sheriffs Department had admitted that use offorce against inmates in the Los \n10  Angeles County jails was disproportionately directed at inmates with mental illness. \n11  \"Los Angeles County jailers are more likely to use force against mentally ill \n12  inmates than other prisoners, according to a new Sheriff s Department report that \n13  acknowledges the lockups need specially trained staff to reduce the violence.\"38 \n14  This admission comes almost four years after Dr. Kupers concluded that deputy on \n15  inmate abuse was disproportionately directed at mentally ill inmates, that deputies \n16  lacked proper training in dealing with the mentally ill, and recommended that \"[aJll \n1 7  officers ... be required to undergo intensive training in working with prisoners \n18  with mental illness.\" \n19  49.  On January 14,2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \n20  United States had filed felony bribery charges against Gilbert Michel, a deputy in \n21  the Sheriffs Department Custody Division?9  The article also reported that Deputy \n22  Michel had \"made statements which implicated him, along with several other jail \n23  employees, as having participated in four prior unreported incidents of improper \n24  uses of force.\" \n25 \n38 Jack Leonard & Robert Faturechi, L.

Representative Examples Of Deputy Violence Against Inmates \n2  50.  Degrading, cruel, and sadistic deputy attacks on inmates are not \n3  isolated incidents at the Jails; they are commonplace.  Time and again, numerous \n4  deputies attack one inmate.  Even as the inmate lies motionless on the ground, new \n5  deputies are summoned by radio and join in the attack.  In the course of a beating, it \n6  is a common practice for deputies to yell \"Stop fighting!\" or \"Stop resisting!\" to an \n7  inmate who is neither fighting nor resisting.  This practice is an effort to fabricate a \n8  reason to blame the inmates for the attacks. \n9  a. \n10  51.  On September 24,2011, Mr. A was lying down on the floor of \n11  his pod in Twin Towers suffering from a migraine headache and vertigo.

When Deputy Alatorre returned later with Deputy Ewell, \n16  Deputy Alatorre grabbed Mr. A by the shirt and tried to pull him off the floor. \n17  Mr. A lost his balance and hit his chin on the floor.  The two deputies dragged \n18  Mr. A to his cell, forced him against the wall, and twisted his right arm so hard that \n19  he yelled out in pain.  Deputy Alatorre pulled down Mr. A's pants below the \n20  buttocks and verbally taunted him, while Deputy Ewell sat on Mr. A's legs right \n21  below IDS exposed buttocks.  Deputy Alatorre pushed Mr. A's face against the wall, \n22  hitting his forehead, and then placed Mr. A in a stress position for several minutes \n23  by pushing IDS knee or boot into Mr. A's back.  Although Mr. A was still suffering \n24  from the migraine and vertigo, in addition to an injured back and an arm that felt \n25  like it was broken, the deputies waved off medical staff from helping Mr. A. \n26 \n27  Due to the ongoing risk of violent retaliation against inmates from deputies in the \n40 \nSheriffs Departmenththe identities of inmates currently housed in the Jails have \n28  been protected -- wit  the exception ofthe named Plaintiffs. \n-19- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  53.  One day later, Mr. A was given twenty-five days in disciplinary \n2  segregation as a result of the incident.  Mr. A was 48 years old at the time of the \n3  beating. \n4  b.  Macario Garcia \n5  54.  In July 2011, when Macario Garcia was housed in Men's \n6  Central Jail, Deputy Chavez came to his cell and told him to get up because he had \n7  an appointment with an eye doctor.  Deputy Chavez handcuffed him from behind \n8  and then escOited Mr. Garcia out of his cell.  Deputy Wiener was standing inside \n9  the gated deputy's control booth next to the cell door controls. \n10  55.  Mr. Garcia is blind in one eye as a result of a previous beating \n11  by deputies.  He is 42 years old, and of very slight build:  he is 6'2\" and weighs 165 \n12  pounds.  At approximately 6'2\" and 275 pounds, Deputy Chavez is of massive \n13  build and outweighs Mr. Garcia by more than 100 pounds.  Deputy Weiner weighs \n14  approximately 220 pounds. \n15  56.  Deputy Weiner said to Mr. Garcia, \"Oh, it's you, you piece of \n16  shit, punk.\"  Evidently referring to an incident two weeks earlier in which he had \n17  strip-searched Mr. Garcia, Deputy Weiner said, \"Shut the fuck up, punk.  You ain't \n18  nothing but a coward bitch.  You had your chance to fight me but you didn't.\" \n19  Deputy Chavez said, \"You're not going to go to your doctor's appointment. ... Get \n20  against the wall.\"  Mr. Garcia complied and faced the wall opposite the deputy's \n21  control booth.  Deputies Chavez and Weiner attacked him, punching him several \n22  times until he fell to the ground from the blows.  After Mr. Garcia fell, Deputies \n23  Chavez and Weiner punched and kicked his head, face, body and legs, and beat his \n24  body and torso with their flashlights.  The deputies also pulled his hair and \n25  slammed his head on the ground.  The beating continued for approximately five \n26  minutes.  Mr. Garcia heard Deputy Weiner call out radio code \"415,\" meaning an \n27  officer is involved in a fight.  Mr. Garcia then blacked out. \n28 \n-20-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  57.  When Mr. Garcia regained consciousness he heard Deputies \n2  Chavez and Weiner yelling, \"Stop resisting! Stop pulling away!\"  Mr. Garcia was \n3  still handcuffed and not resisting in any way.  He saw several other deputies \n4  running toward him.  A deputy sprayed Mr. Garcia in the face with pepper spray as \n5  Deputies Chavez and Weiner continued to punch and kick him. \n6  58.  The deputies then tried to pull Mr. Garcia to his feet by his arms, \n7  which were handcuffed behind him.  Mr. Garcia felt a sharp pain in his collarbone \n8  and heard a loud crack.  Though he yelled in pain, the deputies continued pulling on \n9  his arms and dragged him toward the elevator.  Mr. Garcia's face was covered in \n10  blood.  He was unable to walle so deputies dragged him to the medical clinic. \n11  There, the nurses said that he should be taken to the Los Angeles Medical Center \n12  because his injuries were so serious. \n13  59.  While waiting to be transferred to the hospital, Mr. Garcia heard \n14  deputies laughing at him.  One deputy said, \"You didn't get hit. You fell.\"  A \n15  sergeant and two deputies interviewed him on video about the incident, and \n16  Mr. Garcia reported that Deputies Chavez and Weiner assaulted him. \n17  60.  At the hospital, medical staff told Mr. Garcia that he had a \n18  broken collarbone.  He received stitches above both of his eyebrows and had \n19  bruises on his face and legs.  Mr. Garcia now has dizzy spells and sometimes hears \n20  a ringing in his ear.  Mr. Garcia cannot raise his right arm more than three to six \n21  inches.  Less than a week later, two lieutenants and a sergeant took pictures of \n22  Mr. Garcia's injuries; however, they did not ask him any questions about the \n23  incident.  The DA has since filed criminal charges against Mr. Garcia for, among \n24  other things, assaulting a deputy. \n25  c.  Arturo Fernandez \n26  61.  In July 2011, Arturo Fernandez was returning to his cell when \n27  deputies attacked him, slamming him to the ground, shooting pepper spray into his \n28  eyes, and repeatedly pummeling his body.  While Mr. Fernandez was walking \n-21- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  towards his cell, his hands cuffed behind him, Deputy Guerrero ordered him to \n2  move more quickly, and then began punching the back of his neck.  When \n3  Mr. Fernandez responded with an expletive, Deputy Guerrero forced him to the \n4  wall, pinning him by his neck.  Although Mr. Fernandez did not fight back, Deputy \n5  Guerrero yelled, \"Stop resisting, motherfucker.\"  Another deputy slammed \n6  . Mr. Fernandez to the ground.  With his hands cuffed, Mr. Fernandez could not \n7  break his fall.  More deputies arrived; with pepper spray in his eyes, Mr. Fernandez \n8  could not see how many.  He felt kicks, punches, and hard blows that seemed to \n9  come from flashlights.  After picking Mr. Fernandez up, deputies again slammed \n10    him to the ground. \n11  62.  Throughout the attack, Mr. Fernandez, who has asthma, worried \n12  that he would lose consciousness.  Two eyewitnesses saw him bleeding profusely \nl3  and heard him say that he could not breathe.  When the attack was over, \n14  Mr. Fernandez was sent to the hospital.  He had contusions on his head, required \n15  stitches on his elbow, suffered hearing loss in one ear, and continues to have \n16  headaches. \n17  d.  Lawrence Davis \n18  63.  On March 16,2011, Deputies Diaz, Rodriguez, and Owens \n19  pepper-sprayed and brutally beat a black inmate, Lawrence Davis, until he was \n20  unconscious.  The deputies fractured Mr. Davis's jaw and knocked out one of his \n21  teeth.  One or more of the deputies then carved the letters \"MY\" into Mr. Davis's \n22  scalp.  \"MY\" is the first two letters of the MexicanlHispanic slur \"MYA  TE\" used \n23  pejoratively for blacks. \n24  e.  Mr.B \n25  64.  In March 2011, deputies slammed Mr. B's head into a cement \n26  wall, leaving him with a concussion and a gash that took 35 stitches to close.  The \n27  group of deputies, including Deputies Moorman and Ibarra and Custody Assistant \n28  Perez, punched his face and head, and kicked his ribs.  They aimed pepper spray \n-22- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELlEF \n\n1  into his eyes before shooting taser probes into his back.  The confrontation began \n2  because deputies thought Mr. B had called them \"gay.\"  When Mr. B repeatedly \n3  denied the accusation, a deputy yelled to the row of pro per inmates - who serve as \n4  their own legal representatives - \"y'all pro pers think you can get away with \n5  anything.  We the 3000 Boys,\" a reference to the gang-like group of deputies in \n6  Men's Central Jail, discussed in Paragraph 8 above.  A deputy said to Mr. B, \"Baca \n7  pays us to take kickboxing classes to whip peoples' asses.\"  The deputy grabbed \n8  Mr. B's head, slamming his face into the wall.  nIood poured down, pooling on the \n9  ground, and he passed out.  Deputies handcuffed Mr. B's arms behind his back and \n10  repeatedly punched his face and head, while other deputies stood watching. \n11  65.  When Mr. B regained consciousness, one deputy was sitting on \n12  his back, punching his face and head.  Another was kicking Mr. B's ribs.  Although \n13  Mr. B was motionless, the deputies yelled, \"Stop resisting.\" Mr. B pleaded with \n14  them to stop.  One deputy shot him with pepper spray.  Another sank three taser \n15  probes into his flesh. \n16  66.  Two of the deputies who beat Mr. B stood roughly 6 feet tall, \n17  and weighed approximately 200 pounds.  The custody assistant was slightly shorter \n18  and weighed about 180 pounds.  Mr. B is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 135 pounds. \n19  A sergeant accused him of assaulting the deputies, but the ambulance technician on \n20  the scene pointed out that the deputies showed no signs of injury.  Another sergeant \n21  returned to the module to take pictures of the scene, but he did not interview any of \n22  the imnates who had witnessed the assault. \n23  67.  Mr. B spent two days in the hospital and four days in the jail's \n24  medical unit.  After returning to his row, another deputy threatened him, saying: \n25  \"the ACLU ain't going to be watching me forever.\" \n26  68.  Although there were numerous inmates in the law library who \n27  were able to see the assault through the library window, no one from LASD \n28  bothered to interview any of the eyewitnesses. \n-23- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nI  f.  Gabriel Carillo \n2  69.  On or about February 26, 2011, at least three deputies, including \n3  Deputy Luviano, severely beat Gabriel Carillo, who had come to Men's Central Jail \n4  to visit his brother.  The deputies repeatedly kicked and punched Mr. Carillo, while \n5  he was handcuffed, severely cutting and bruising his face (photos attached hereto as \n6  Exhibit A).  The deputies also pepper sprayed Mr. Carillo in the face while he was \n7  handcuffed and lying on the floor.  During the beating one or more deputies \n8  repeatedly yelled \"Stop resisting! Stop kicking!\" even though Mr. Carillo was not \n9  resisting or kicking.  Subsequently the deputies filed false reports causing the \n10  District Attorney to charge Mr. Carillo with battery against a peace officer, resisting \nII  arrest, and three other counts.  On October 14, 2011, the DA dismissed the charges \n12  against him. \n13  g.  Cesar Mancilla \n14  70.  On or about February 24, 2011, deputies savagely beat Cesar \n15  Mancilla at IRC.  Mr. Mancilla was in a large holding cell with other inmates, when \n16  the deputies ordered him to stand with his head down.  Mr. Mancilla obeyed. \n17  Suddenly, and without justification or warning, several uniformed personnel \n18  attacked Mr. Mancilla, hitting, kicking, and pepper-spraying him.  The deputies \n19  handcuffed Mr. Mancilla, and continued to beat him.  Mr. Mancilla was denied \n20  food, water, and medical attention for the remainder of the night. \n21  71.  On February 25,2011, a doctor examined Mr. Mancilla and \n22  determined he had a collapsed lung, two broken ribs, a nasal fracture, four broken \n23  teeth (photo attached hereto as Exhibit B), bums on his skin from the pepper spray, \n24  and other injuries.  Mr. Mancilla was in jail on a non-violent misdemeanor. \n25  h.  Stephen Teran (Second Incident) \n26  72.  In February 2011, while Stephen Teran was housed in Men's \n27  Central Jail, deputies heard that Mr. Teran's attorney had requested his medical \n28  records relating to a use offorce.  The deputies beat Mr. Teran, repeatedly punching \n-24- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  and kicking his body, neck, and head. Mr. Teran's cheekbone was broken.  He had \n2  to wear a neck brace, and doctors told him that he may have suffered nerve damage. \n3  i.  Garry Crumpton \n4  73.  In January 2011, while inmates in Men's Central Jail were in a \n5  line headed to court, Deputy Ortiz shoved Garry Crumpton against the wall. \n6  Mr. Crumpton said, \"You didn't have to do me like that.\"  Deputy Ortiz then placed \n7  him in a painful chokehold. Even though Mr. Crumpton put his hands in the air in \n8  a show of non-resistance, Deputy Ortiz slammed him to the floor, knocking him \n9  unconscious.  Another deputy instructed all the other inmates in line to face the \n10  wall.  While Mr. Crumpton lay face-down and motionless on the ground, seven or \n11  eight deputies punched and kicked him. He was removed to a caged area in the jail. \n12  Deputy Ortiz came by to speak with him about the incident.  Though Mr. Crumpton \n13  did not agree with the deputy's account, he assented to everything Deputy Ortiz \n14  said because he did not want to be assaulted again. \n15  J.  Michael Cervantes \n16  74.  In December 2010, Deputy Lyon noticed Mr. Cervantes's gang \n17  tattoo and began smacking the back of his head and taunting him.  When \n18  Mr. Cervantes turned to look at Deputy Lyon, he punched Mr. Cervantes's left \n19  cheek, tackled him to the ground, sat on top of him, and punched his face and neck. \n20  Approximately eight other deputies rushed to join Deputy Lyon.  The deputies \n21  bashed Mr. Cervantes's leg with a flashlight until he bled, kicked him in the \n22  stomach, and stunned him twice with a tasergun.  When the attack was over, the \n23  deputies cautioned Mr. Cervantes not to tell the nurses \"anything funny.\"  Due to \n24  the severity of his injuries, Mr. Cervantes was taken to the hospital and spent one \n25  week in the jail's medical ward.  He continues to suffer dizzy spells. \n26  k.  Stephen Teran (First Incident) \n27  75.  In December 2010, several deputies severely beat Stephen Teran \n28  while he was in the IRC. \n-25- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  76.  While Mr. Teran was being searched, Custody Assistant \n2  Martinez repeatedly told him to hurry up.  Martinez then grabbed Mr. Teran by the \n3  neck, choking him, and dragged him to a cell where he threw Mr. Teran to the \n4  ground.  Martinez kicked him in the ribs two or three times.  Deputy Sims, who was \n5  present during the attack, told Mr. Teran, \"If you give us any problems we're going \n6  to put you in the hospital.\" \n7  77.  A few hours later, Mr. Teran was sent back to the processing \n8  line.  While interviewing Mr. Teran for classification purposes, Deputy Sims \n9  dropped Mr. Teran's classification card on the floor next to him and told him to \n10    pick it up.  When Mr. Teran did not pick up the card, Deputy Sims punched him in \n11  the face, Imocking him over.  Deputy Sims then threw Mr. Teran to the floor and \n12  repeatedly kicked him in the head and torso.  Four to six other deputies, including \n13  Deputies Miller and Escobado, ran over and joined in the beating, punching, \n14  kicking, and striking Mr. Teran with their flashlights.  As they were beating \n15  Mr. Teran, the deputies yelled, \"Stop fighting! Stop resisting!\" \n16  78.  After two or three minutes, the deputies dragged Mr. Teran to a \n17  cell and handcuffed him to the leg of a bench, forcing him to kneel on the floor. \n18  The deputies kicked Mr. Teran in the back several times.  Mr. Teran saw blood \n19  pouring offhis head and face, pooling on the ground beneath him.  He heard the \n20  deputies say they did not want blood on their clothes.  The deputies then they put a \n21  plastic bag over Mr. Teran's head, making it almost impossible for him to breathe. \n22  The deputies laughed as they left the cell. \n23  79.  The deputies returned about twenty minutes later and told \n24  Mr. Teran he would be interviewed on camera.  They threatened to press charges if \n25  he said anything.  Mr. Teran told the interviewer that he had fallen.  Later, the \n26  deputies again threatened him and warned him not to talk about the incident. \n27 \n28 \n-26- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTrvE RELIEF \n\n1  I.  Rashaad Pilgrim \n2  80.  In July 2010, deputies in Men's Central Jail targeted Rashaad \n3  Pilgrim as he stood in line to receive his medication.  The deputies instructed all of \n4  the inmates in line to face the wall.  Deputy Reza approached Mr. Pilgrim from \n5  behind and yelled at him before punching him twice in the face.  When Mr. Pilgrim \n6  returned to his cell a few minutes later, he called his mother to report what \n7  happened.  Not long after, Deputies Reza and Milpad ordered the inmates to line up \n8  and go to the day room, but instructed Mr. Pilgrim to stay behind and face the wall. \n9  One deputy spread his legs, as ifto search him.  Instead, the other deputies began to \n10  punch Mr. Pilgrim in the face and head.  Mr. Pilgrim lost consciousness.  When \n11  Mr. Pilgrim woke up, he was on the floor and the deputies were still punching him \n12  and yelling, \"Stop fighting!\"  A deputy then slammed Mr. Pilgrim's face into the \n13  concrete floor, chipping his teeth.  Later, doctors told Mr. Pilgrim he had fractures \n14  in his face, blunt head trauma, injury to his right ear, and a chipped tooth. \n15  m.  Alex Krehbiel \n16  81.  In July 2010, a deputy approached Alex Krehbiel as he was \n17  returning from a visit with his attorney.  Mr. Krehbiel had been trying to get back to \n18  his housing unit but the door was locked.  The deputy ordered Mr. Krehbiel to face \n19  the wall and yelled in his ear, \"This is my fucking house! Where do you think you \n20  are? This is my fucking housel\"  The deputy then slammed Mr. Krehbiel's forehead \n21  against the wall twice.  A group of deputies approached, taunting Mr. Krehbiel, and \n22  one of them punched him in the face.  The deputies pushed Mr. Krehbiel into the \n23  laundry room, knocked him to the floor, and punched and kicked his head, ribs, and \n24  back.  The deputies then pepper sprayed Mr. Krehbiel's eyes and mouth, and \n25  slammed his head into the floor.  As a result of the incident, Mr. Krehbiel was \n26  given twenty-nine days in disciplinary segregation. \n27 \n28 \n-27 - COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTJVE RELIEF \n\n1  n.  Juan Diego Mares \n2  82.  In June 2010, deputies beat Juan Diego Mares so violently that \n3  he suffered a fractured jaw, and required multiple eye surgeries and eight stitches in \n4  his ear.  The incident began after deputies conducted a search of all the cells on \n5  Mr. Mares's row.  Mr. Mares noticed that some of his property was missing, \n6  including items he had just purchased from the commissary.  After Mr. Mares \n7  asked to speak with a sergeant about the missing property, Deputy Carefoot shoved \n8  him hard against a wall, slapped his car, punched his face several times, and threw \n9  him to the ground.  Once Mr. Mares was on the ground, Deputy Carefoot kicked \n10  him roughly ten times in the face, jaw, and back of his head, causing a large pool of \n11  Mr. Mares's blood to form on the floor.  The deputy then kicked Mr. Mares's ear \n12  three times, an experience he described as more painful than when he was hit by a \n13  car.  Following the attack, a senior deputy questioned Mr. Mares about the incident \n14  and said to him, \"You know you're going [back] to the same module once they're \n15  done cleaning you up.\"  Mr. Mares interpreted this as the senior deputy threatening \n16  him not to report the incident. \n17  o.  Santiago Sanchez \n18  83.  In June 2010 a deputy assaulted Santiago Sanchez following a \n19  visit from Mr. Sanchez's girlfriend and mother.  The deputy grabbed the back of \n20  Mr. Sanchez's shirt and swung him into a steel pole.  The deputy proceeded to \n21  place Mr. Sanchez into a stress position, twisting both of his arms behind his back \n22  so his fmgers were pressed between his shoulder blades.  The deputy then slammed \n23  Mr. Sanchez's head down on top of the metal counter in the visitation room.  The \n24  deputy held Mr. Sanchez in that position for a minute or two while verbally \n25  harassing him. \n26  p.  Jimmie Knott \n27  84.  Tn June 201 0, while waiting in line for his hepatitis shot, Jimmie \n28  Knott asked Senior Deputy Sanchez if he could get some new shoes, as his had a \n-28- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  split in them.  Senior Deputy Sanchez told Mr. Knott to get out of line and to strip \n2  down.  Mr. Knott complied and stripped to his boxers.  Senior Deputy Sanchez then \n3  told him to get on his knees, and as Mr. Knott was bending to the floor, Senior \n4  Deputy Sanchez hit him in tbe temple, causing his head to bleed.  Other deputies \n5  then came over and began hitting, kicking and lmeeing him.  Mr. Knott curled into \n6  a fetal position and waited for the violence to subside.  After two or three minutes, \n7  the deputies stopped hitting him and took him to medical.  On the way to medical, \n8  the deputies told him to say that he fell down the stairs.  Mr. Knott complied, \n9  because he was afraid of being beaten again.  Mario Love witnessed the attack and \n10  verified Mr. Knott's account.  Mr. Love described the deputies involved as being \n11  like \"a pack of wolves.\"  Later, while Mr. Love was waiting to talk to the ACLU, \n12  deputies pulled him aside and interrogated him in a threatening way. \n13  q.  Joseph Hager \n14  85.  In June 2010, deputies took Joseph Hager out of his cell and \n15  placed him in handcuffs to go to the law library.  At the library, a deputy shoved \n16  Mr. Hager up against the wall and kicked his ankle so forcefully it bled.  The \n17  deputy then dragged Mr. Hager, who was still handcuffed, back to the tier, where \n18  he slammed Mr. Hager's face .into the edge of a door frame.  Mr. Hager blacked \n19  out.  When Mr. Hager regained consciousness, he was on the ground and Deputies \n20  Chavez and Gonzalez were ldcking and punching him in the head and face.  Even \n21  though Mr. Hager was handcuffed, the deputies repeatedly yelled, \"Stop resisting!\" \n22  When the beat.ing subsided, Deputy Chavez told him, \"I tried to ldll you.  You are \n23  lucky you are still breathing.\" The beating caused a fracture in Mr. Hager's face, a \n24  black eye, swelling in his ears, and bleeding in his mouth.  When staff members \n25  interviewed Mr. Hager on camera, he said that he had slipped in the shower, out of \n26  fear of what the deputies would do to him ifhe revealed that they had beaten him. \n27  After the beating, Mr. Hager was sent to disciplinary segregation and told he was \n28  being charged with assault on a deputy. \n-29- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  r.  Matthew Gjersvold \n2  86.  On May 28, 2010, while housed in Twin Towers, Matthew \n3  Gjersvold slept through a deputy's call for a head count because of the sleep \n4  medication he was taking.  Another inmate woke up Mr. Gjersvold, who is a former \n5  police officer, but the deputies noticed that he was late.  Deputy Van Du told \n6  Mr. Gjersvold to stand facing the stairs, and then forcefully shoved him onto the \n7  metal steps.  Deputy Van Du then handcuffed Mr. Gjersvold and escorted him back \n8  to his cell.  At the cell, Deputy Van Du pulled violently on the handcuffs, causing \n9  Mr. Gjersvold to fall backwards and break his wrist. \n10  s.  Luis Bueno \n11  87.  In May 2010, Luis Bueno was on his way to the church in \n12  Men's Central Jail.  Deputies told Mr. Bueno to turn around and return to his ceil. \n13  As Mr. Bueno was walking back to his cell, a deputy shoved him against the wall \n14  and asked him ifhe wanted to get \"fucked up.\"  As other deputies ani.ved, the frrst \n15  deputy forced Mr. Bueno to spread his legs and put his hands behind his back.  The \n16  deputy then aimed his mace at Mr. Bueno's face.  When Mr. Bueno turned his head \n17  to avoid the spray, another deputy punched him in the neck.  Three other deputies \n18  joined in and began violently punching Mr. Bueno in the head and body. \n19  Mr. Bueno was knocked to the floor, where the beating continued.  When the \n20  beating subsided, deputies took Mr. Bueno to the medical center, where he was told \n21  he had a fractured nose, a tom ligament in his ankle, a swollen artery in his brain, \n22  and possible rib fractures.  Mr. Bueno is now afraid to attend church for fear of \n23  encountering the deputies who attacked him. \n24  t.  Walter Morales \n25  88.  For about a week in May 2010, deputies in Men's Central Jail \n26  beat Walter Morales twice a day with flashlights about his head and body. \n27  Mr. Morales believes the deputies beat him because he was arrested for allegedly \n28  firing a gun at police officers.  A group of deputies came into Mr. Morales's cell \n-30- COMPLA INT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  and punched and hit him with flashlights.  Mr. Morales has a scar above his eye as \n2  a result.  Later, a second shift of deputies beat Mr. Morales while he was restrained \n3  in waist chains and handcuffs. \n4  u.  Michael Holguin \n5  89.  In October 2009, deputies beat Michael Holguin so severely that \n6  he was hospitalized with a broken leg, stitches on his face, and staples in his head. \n7  The incident occurred as Mr. Holguin was on his way to the showers.  A deputy \n8  told him to go back to his cell, preventing him from using the showers. \n9  Mr. Holguin asked him why, because he had not received a shower in weeks.  The \n10  deputy told him to tum around and placed Mr. Holguin in handcuffs.  The rest of \n11  the beating is a blur to Mr. Holguin; all he remembers is being punched in the face \n12  by Deputy Luviano and pepper sprayed.  When the beating was over, Deputy Rico \n13  said, \"That's why you don't say why; just do what you're told.\"  When Mr. Holguin \n14  returned from the hospital, he was sent to disciplinary segregation for \"attacking a \n15  deputy.\" \n16  v.  Gordon Grbavac \n17  90.  In August 2009, deputies in Twin Towers handcuffed Gordon \n18  Grbavac, took him into an attorney room, and slammed his head into a thick glass \n19  wall more than half a dozen times, leaving blood on the window.  When a sergeant \n20  entered the room and asked Mr. Grbavac what had happened, he said the deputies \n21  had assaulted him.  The sergeant said he would be right back.  While he was gone \n22  one of the deputies who had assaulted Mr. Grbavac threatened him, saying, \"Are \n23  you fucking kidding me?  You motherfucker!  You better change your story or we \n24  are going to show you what we do to fat asses.  You better say you did this to \n25  yourself.\"  Mr. Grbavac thought that the deputies might kill him if he disobeyed, so \n26  he agreed to tell the sergeant that his injuries were self-inflicted.  When the sergeant \n27  returned with a video camera to interview Mr. Grbavac, one of the deputies who \n28  assaulted him was in the room, and the sergeant did not ask him to .leave.  Because \n-31- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  of the deputy's threats, Mr. Grbavac altered his story and said he had banged his \n2  own head against the window.

Even after the deputies had Mr. D fully restrained on the \n7  floor with his hands behind his back, they repeatedly shot him with a taser.  One \n8  deputy said to Mr. D, \"Man, I was trying to kill you.\"  The deputies threatened \n9  Mr. D after the attack and told him not to tell anyone what had happened.  Mr. D \n10  still has scars on his face and head from the beating. \n11  C.  Numerous Additional Incidents of Deputies Using Force Against \n12  Non-Resisting Inmates \n13  94.

With blood dripping from a long \n2  gash in his face onto the floor, Mr. F was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. \n3  Although a doctor stated that Mr. F needed stitches, two deputies told the doctor \n4  that Mr. F was fine and Mr. F left the hospital without the stitches.  A sergeant \n5  video recorded Mr. F's injuries when he initially boarded the ambulance, and later \n6  interviewed him on camera about the beating.  The sergeant infonned Mr. F that he \n7  could file a lawsuit, but that it would be a \"waste oftime.\"  Mr. F still has difficulty \n8  seeing out of his left eye. \n9  97.

Racially Motivated Deputy Violence \n8  121.  Many deputies have assaulted inmates while taunting them with \n9  racial epithets.  In August 2011, after choking inmate Mr. P and repeatedly \n10  slamming his head and face into a metal bar and a wall in Men's Central Jail, \n11  Deputy Valdez yelled, \"I hate you motherfucking monkeys.  Damn nigger!\" \n12  122.  In July 2011, inmate Mr. Q witnessed a deputy on the 3000 floor \n13  in Men's Central Jail grab a non-resisting African-American inmate, kick his legs, \n14  and yell, \"All you blacks!  When you mess with my trustees, this is what's going to \n15  happen to you.\"  Numerous deputies then joined the attack, and began kicking, \n16  punching, and hitting the inmate with flashlights.  After the attack, Mr. Q saw \n17  trustees cleaning blood off the floor and wall. \n18  123.  In June 2011, a deputy in Men's Central Jail said of inmate \n19  Michael Jefferson, who is African-American, \"This nigger can't fucking listen and \n20  face the wall.\"  A deputy then smashed Mr. Jefferson's face into the wall.  Shortly \n21  thereafter, Deputy Quintana punched Mr. Jefferson in the face while he was \n22  escorting him back to his module. \n23  124.  In October 2009, deputies performing cell searches in Men's \n24  Central Jail took Mr. R's commissary items.  When he complained, a deputy asked \n25  Mr. R, who is African-American, \"What's your problem, Monkey?\"  The deputy \n26  told Mr. R to face his cell and forcefully shoved him into the bars of the cell door. \n27  Later that day, after ACLU monitors visited Mr. R's row, deputies threatened all of \n28  the inmates with a bean bag canister gun that contains pepper spray pellets.  A \n-38- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  deputy said, \"We don't give a fuck about the ACLU.  This is our house.  They don't \n2  fucking live here.\" \n3  125.  In July 2009, Deputies Delgado, Aviles, Rivera, Thompson, \n4  Ortega, Snyder, and others severely beat inmate Evans Tutt on the 3000 floor in \n5  Men's Central Jail, while calling Tutt a \"fucking nigger.\"  During the beating, the \n6  deputies handcuffed Mr. Tutt, and then tasered him, beat him with flashlights, and \n7  kicked him.  The deputies broke Mr. Tutt's nose in multiple places, injured his ribs, \n8  head, face, knee, and leg, chipped his tooth, and left bruises all over his body.  The \n9  deputies then wrote false reports that prompted the Los Angeles County District \n10  Attorney to file criminal charges against Mr. Tutt for resisting a peace officer.  The \n11  charges were eventually dismissed.  Three of the deputies involved in the incident \n12  have been identified as members of the 3000 Boys, and two of them were involved \n13  in the 2010 Christmas Brawl at a banquet hall in Montebello, described in \n14  paragraph 4l. \n15  E.  Deputy Violence Against Mentally III Inmates \n16  126.  In June 2010, Mr. S, who was suicidal, walked out of his cell \n17  with a strip of bed linen tied around his neck and threatened to kill himself.  Mr. S \n18  had repeatedly asked deputies to see the psychiatrist, but they had mocked him and \n19  denied him access to mental health care.  Custody Assistant Gonzalez shoved Mr. S \n20  back into the cell, turned to his cellmate, Gary Sanchez, and ordered Mr. Sanchez to \n21  \"regulate\" Mr. S.  Mr. Sanchez underst06d this to mean the deputies wanted him to \n22  keep Mr. S in line by beating him. \n23  127.  In October 2009, while in the IRC, inmate Jonny Johnson saw \n24  deputies verbally abusing an elderly man who was visibly mentally ill.  The man \n25  was unable to follow the deputies' directions.  The deputies began to taunt the man \n26  and threw a sandwich at him, hitting him in the head.  Mr. Johnson came to the \n27  man's defense and told the deputies to stop picking on him.  A group of deputies \n28  then took Mr. Johnson out of the holding cell.  One deputy shoved Mr. Johnson's \n-39- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  head against the wall, while two others began punching him in the torso, knocking \n2  the wind out of him.  The deputies then took Mr. Johnson to an area where other \n3  inmates were handing out bedding and ordered him to help.  The deputies told \n4  Mr. Johnson that as he handed out the bedding, he had to say to each inmate, \"T'm a \n5  faggot and the deputies are the bomb.\" \n6  128.  In September 2009 in Men's Central Jail, Deputy Navarro \n7  stopped Eefrom Jones as he returned from an attorney visit.  Mr. Jones is on \n8  psychotropic medication duc to a mental illness.  Dcputy Navarro pullcd Mr. Jones \n9  to the ground and sat on him as he punched him.  Other deputies came over and \n10  joined in the beating, breaking Mr. Jones's shoulder.  The deputies shot Mr. Jones \n11  with a taser and repeatedly pepper sprayed him in the face, although he told them \n12  he had asthma.  Approximately two weeks later, after a lieutenant interviewed \n13  Mr. Jones about the incident, Deputy Navarro came to Mr. Jones's cell to escort \n14  him to the psychologist.  In the hallway, Deputy Navarro ordered Mr. Jones to strip \n15  naked and bend over.  Deputy Navarro yelled that this was his floor, and he would \n16  do whatever he wanted.  Deputy Navarro shone his flashlight at Mr. Jones's rear \n17  and another deputy put his finger in Mr. Jones's anus, as other deputies looked on \n18  and laughed.  After these incidents, Mr. Jones reported feeling suicidal. \n19  F.  Deputy Assaults Against Inmates For Rules Infractions Or \n20  Perceived Slights \n21  129.  Deputies often beat inmates for minor rules infractions or \n22  perceived slights.  In December 2010, a deputy in Twin Towers savagely beat \n23  Derek Griscavage after Mr. Griscavage showed the deputy his middle finger.  First, \n24  Deputy Jackson kicked Mr. Griscavage and contorted his shoulders in a manner that \n25  caused him pain.  Deputy Jackson then handcuffed Mr. Griscavage and led him \n26  away from the pod.  Shortly thereafter an eyewitness saw a deputy push \n27  Mr. Griscavage causing him to fall down.  Then at least four deputies began to beat \n28  him.  The deputies knocked Mr. Griscavage unconscious, and he woke up in the \n-40- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  hospital with severe lacerations, a broken nose, a chipped tooth, and bruises on his \n2  head.  Thee days later, deputies moved Mr. Griscavage to the disciplinary \n3  segregation unit for alleged \"assault on a deputy.\" \n4  130.  In February 2010, deputies in the jails' Correctional Treatment \n5  Center attacked Devon Mannings, an inmate who suffers from a seizure disorder. \n6  Mr. Mannings told the deputy he \"didn't have a date since high schoo!.\"  The \n7  deputy returned with Deputy Campos and slammed Mr. Marmings to the ground. \n8  The deputies threw Mr. Maunings's personal letters, pictures, and legal paperwork \n9  into the toilet.  One deputy stomped on Mr. Mannings's hand with his boot, \n10  . shattering his knuclde.  The deputies repeatedly kicked Mr. Mannings's body while \n11  yelling, \"Stop resisting,\" even though he was not resisting in any way.  The \n12  deputies handcuffed Mr. Marmings and continued to kick his body and face.  The \n13  deputies then shot pepper spray into Mr. Mannings's face and used a taser on him, \n14  which caused Mr. Mannings to have a seizure.  When Mr. Mannings regained \n15  consciousness after the seizure, he saw blood around him on the floor.  As a result \n16  of the beating, Mr. Maunings suffered extensive bruises and required surgery on the \n17  shattered knuckle.  He was interviewed on camera and a senior deputy told Mr. \n18  Mannings the incident would be investigated.  Although Mr. Mannings was \n19  supposed to be allowed to present his version of events at his disciplinary hearing, \n20  he was not permitted to do so. \n21  G.  Deputies' Use OfInmates As Pawns To Inflict Violence On Other \n22  Inmates \n23  131.  Deputies regularly pit inmates against other inmates, using them \n24  as pawns to carry out acts of violence.  Deputies sometimes instigate violence \n25  between inmates by allowing inmates from rival gangs to have physical access to \n26  each other (for example, by opening up their cell doors from the deputy control \n27  booth), or by fomenting discord (for example, by mentioning an inmate's gang \n28 \n-41- COMPLAINT FOR INmNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  afftliation to inmates from a rival gang, or stating in front of other irunates that an \n2  inmate is a sex offender). \n3  132.  In March 2011, four inmates beat and sexually assaulted another \n4  inmate after an LASD custody assistant opened the door to the victim's cell.  The \n5  controls to open cell doors are located inside a locked control booth accessible only \n6  to deputies and custody assistants.  After the cell door was opened, two irunates \n7  went inside and began punching the victim.  An inmate witness heard the victim \n8  screaming for several minutes.  Later that evening, the witness heard an inmate say \n9  that the victim was going to be sexually assaulted with a broomstick.  The victim's \n10  cell door was once again opened and four irunates entered, one of them carrying a \n11  broomstick.  The witness heard the victim screaming and saw a broomstick handle \n12  with blood on it sticking out of the cell.  Later, the witness saw the victim being \n13  escorted away from the cell by a deputy; there was a large amount of blood on the \n14  victim's pants. \n15  133.  Deputies in Men's Central Jail allowed other inmates to assault \n16  Donald Shorts.  Mr. Shorts is a former gang member and was frequently the target \n17  of assaults from members of his former gang.  In June 2010, two inmates who were \n18  housed in a different module approached Mr. Shorts's cell.  The only way they \n19  could have appeared at this cell is if deputies opened the gates.  One of the irunates \n20  then yelled to the deputies to open Mr. Shorts's cell door.  The deputies complied, \n21  and the two inmates entered the cell and assaulted Mr. Shorts, beating him with \n22  their fists and cutting his face and chest with a shank (a homemade knife).  The next \n23  day, deputies charged Mr. Shorts with possession of a shank, fighting, and \n24  insubordination to staff. \n25  134.  In March 2011, a deputy marched Jeremiah Wilkerson past \n26  members of a rival gang, telling them, \"This is a Norteno.  If the door's 'racked' \n27  [opened] you know what to do.\"  Mr. Wilkerson believed the deputy was trying to \n28  make him a target for an attack in retaliation for an earlier altercation. \n-42- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  135.  Cameron Saul, a fonner inmate who now works as a drug \n2  treatment counselor, served as a \"house mouse\" (a liaison between inmates and \n3  deputies) for part of his time in Men's Central Jail, and reported to the deputies \n4  about inmates who were causing problems.  On several occasions, deputies told \n5  Mr. Saul that inmates should \"handle the problem,\" and that Mr. Saul should line \n6  up at least two inmates to say that the problem-causing inmate had \"slipped in the \n7  shower,\" in case that inmate complained following the attack.  Mr. Saul later \n8  witnessed other inmates take so-called problem inmates to the back of the module \n9  and attack them, without deputies intervening to prevent the attack. \n10  136.  A deputy placed Mr. T, an inmate who had been in protective \n11  custody, in the general population tank, where he was viciously attacked by other \n12  inmates.  Mr. T suffered contusions on his head, a busted lip, blurry vision, a \n13  swollen ear, and severe emotional trauma. \n14  137.  Michael Topete heard someone yelling, \"Help, they're killing \n15  me!\" while someone else was yelling \"Shut the fuck up!\"  The next morning, \n16  Mr. Topete heard other inmates say, \"They killed the rapist.\"  In an unrelated \n17  incident, deputies placed Mr. Topete, who had previously been in protective \n18  custody, in the general population, where he was attacked by other inmates. \n19  138.  On several occasions, deputies placed Rodolpho Mendoza, who \n20  was in protective custody, with inmates from the general population, who attacked \n21  him. \n22  139.  In 2009, Therin McGuire witnessed deputies ordering two \n23  inmates to beat up a third inmate in MCJ. \n24  H.  Even Civilians Have Witnessed Deputy Violence Against Inmates \n25  140.  Unchecked deputy-on-inmate violence in Men's Central Jail and \n26  Twin Towers has become so pervasive and routine in recent years that deputies \n27  carry out savage attacks even in the presence of civilian eye witnesses.  Thomas \n28  Parker, fonner Assistant Special Agent in Charge ofthe FBI's Los Angeles Field \n-43- COMPLAINT FOR INruNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  Office noted that the phenomenon of deputies beating inmates in areas visible to \n2  civilians suggests that \"the culture of deputy violence in the Jails has become so \n3  hardened and pervasive that deputies feel emboldened to carry out their attacks \n4  even in non-secluded areas.\" \n5  141.  In February 2009, Jails Chaplain Paulino Juarez witnessed a \n6  beating on the 3000 floor in Men's Central Jail.  Chaplain Juarez was visiting \n7  inmates as part of his ministry, when he heard the sounds of someone being beaten. \n8  When he walked towards the noises, he saw three deputies, including Deputies \n9  Ramirez and Aguilar, in a hallway pounding the face and body of an inmate who \n10  stood with his back to the wall.  The inmate appeared to be handcuffed; he was \n11  neither raising his hands to protect himself, nor resisting in any way.  The deputies \n12  punched the inmate until he collapsed face-first on the ground, at which point they \n13  began kicking him in the head and body.  Until this point, the inmate had implored \n14  the deputies to stop.  On the ground, he fell silent.  Though the inmate was \n15  apparently unconscious, deputies continued to punch and kick him, and yelled, \n16  \"Stop fighting!\" \n17  142.  A deputy finally noticed that Chaplain Juarez was watching the \n18  attack and made signs to the others to stop the beating.  But a call had gone out to \n19  other deputies to join in the attack, and two more deputies entered the hallway and \n20  began to kick the motionless inmate.  One deputy stomped on the inmate's back. \n21  Those deputies who had noticed Chaplain Juarez motioned to the other deputies to \n22  alert them to his presence. \n23  143.  At the end ofthe beating there was a puddle of blood some two \n24  feet in diameter around the inmate's head.  Chaplain Juarez was overwhelmed with \n25  fear, worried deputies would harm him.  Several eyed him in a threatening way. \n26  Some said \"rat\" and \"motherfucker\" when he passed them in the jail over the next \n27  few days. \n28 \n-44- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTJVE RELIEF \n\n1  144.  Chaplain Juarez wrote a detailed report of the incident, which he \n2  gave to a sergeant and his supervisor at the archdiocese, and he was interviewed by \n3  the LASD.  Two years passed before he heard anything from the LASD about the \n4  beating.  In a June 2011 meeting among employees of the archdiocese and \n5  personnel from OIR, Chaplain Juarez was told that the case had been resolved \n6  intemally, and that news of the beating had never reached SheriffBaca.  After the \n7  meeting with OIR, a representative of SheriffBaca's office contacted the Catholic \n8  chaplains to set up a meeting with the Sheriff. \n9  145.  In July 2011, Sheriff Baca told Chaplain Juarez that the detailed \n10  report Chaplain Juarez had written and delivered to the LASD was not included in \n11  the LASD's file on the incident.  The file that SheriffBaca read aloud from \n12  described Chaplain Juarez as \"exaggerating\" the details of the beating.  The \n13  description of the attack in the LASD file from which SheriffBaca read aloud \n14  seemed to describe a totally different incident from the one Chaplain Juarez had \n15  witnessed:  the file said the inmate was schizophrenic and that deputies had to strike \n16  him a few times with their fists to get him into his cell.  SheriffBaca seemed \n17  unconcerned, stating simply that \"punches are allowed but kicks are not allowed in \n18  my department.\" \n19  146.  In February 2011, another Jail Chaplain, Chaplain Doe, was \n20  walking towards the chaplain's office on the third floor of Men's Central Jail, when \n21  he saw four or five deputies repeatedly kicking an inmate.  The inmate lay \n22  motionless, face-down on the ground.  His hands appeared to be tucked behind his \n23  back, where they remained throughout the attack.  The inmate pleaded with the \n24  deputies to stop, yelling, \"Help me!\"  After the deputies continuously kicked the \n25  inmate for between two and three minutes, the deputies ordered Chaplain Doe to \n26  leave the scene.  Chaplain Doe was afraid that if he tried to stop the beating or even \n27  asked the deputies to stop, they would hurt him.  Although Chaplain Doe could no \n28  longer see the beating at this point, he could still hear the \"thumping\" sounds ofthe \n-45- COMPLAlNT FORlNJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  deputies kicking the inmate, and the inmate's cries for help.  Eventually the inmate \n2  fell silent but the kicks continued for about another minute.  Neither LASD nor the \n3  aIR ever questioned Chaplain Doe about th.e incident, even though a sergeant and \n4  numerous deputies were aware that he was an eyewitness to the beating. \n5  147.  On January 24, 2011, Esther Lim, the ACLU Jails Project \n6  Coordinator, witnessed the savage beating of an immobile, seemingly unconscious \n7  inmate in Twin Towers.  At the time, Ms. Lim was meeting with another inmate in \n8  the facility's attorney room.  When she heard what sounded like a fight in the \n9  Staging Area, she looked through the windows dividing the attorney room and the \n10  Staging Area and saw the attack in progress.  Deputies Ochoa and Hirsch \n11  repeatedly punched and kneed an inmate who lay face-down and inert on the floor. \n12  The inmate was so still that Ms. Lim thought he looked like \"a mannequin that was \n13  being used as a punching bag.\"  But the deputies persisted in their attack, with one \n14  ofthem shocking the inmate again and again with a taser gun.  Although the inmate \n15  never moved from his spot on the ground, the deputies repeatedly yelled, \"Stop \n16  fighting!\" and \"Stop resisting!\" \n17  148.  Scott Budnick, a civilian volunteer who mentors young inmates, \n18  witnessed five deputy-on-inmate beatings at Men's Central Jail over a three-year \n19  period. \n20  149.  In early 2007, Mr. Budnick witnessed an incident in which \n21  approximately seven deputies used a taser gun repeatedly on an inmate who was \n22  lying on the ground motionless.  When Mr. Budnick told a deputy what he had \n23  seen, the deputy replied, \"Yeah, we fuck these guys up all the time.\" \n24  150.  In 2008, while Mr. Budnick waited outside the classroom where \n25  he taught inmates, he saw a deputy pull an inmate out of a line, strip search him in \n26  full view of numerous people, and then smash his head into the wall with such force \n27  that Mr. Budnick heard a loud crack.  The inmate had not attacked or threatened the \n28  deputy in any way before the attack. \n-46-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELJEF \n\n1  151.  In December 2008, again while standing outside his classroom, \n2  Mr. Budnick saw three deputies stop and strip search an inmate who was walking \n3  down the hall.  The deputies forcefully twisted the inmate's arm behind his back \n4  and shoved him to the grOlmd.  The inmate had not attacked or threatened the \n5  deputies in any way. \n6  152.  In or about July 2009, Mr. Budnick saw several deputies taunt \n7  an inmate who asked them for directions to the inmate's module.  The deputies then \n8  twisted the inmate's arm behind his back, grabbed the inmate's head and put it \n9  against the wall, and then pushed the inmate's face into the wall. \n10  153.  In 2009, Mr. Budnick witnessed three deputies kicking and \n11  punching an inmate.  When the inmate fell down, the deputies continued attacking \n12  him while he lay on the floor.  The deputies repeatedly yelled \"Stop resisting!\" -\n13  even though Mr. Budnick could see that the inmate was not moving, much less \n14  resisting. \n15  154.  Several chaplains cautioned Mr. Budnick not to report one \n16  incident of abuse that he witnessed, telling him that ifhe reported the incident, he \n17  would no longer be allowed to volunteer.  The chaplains said that they refrained \n18  from reporting incidents of abuse out of fear of losing their jobs.  Several civilians \n19  also said that they were afraid to intervene in the deputy-on-inmate attacks they \n20  witnessed, for fear ifthey tried to stop the attacks, deputies would assault them. \n21  155.  Mr. Budnick did report the July 2009 incident to Sergeant \n22  Renfro, who promised to \"get into this immediately.\"  Mr. Budnick, however, was \n23  never interviewed about what he had observed.  He never heard back from the \n24  sergeant, or anyone else at the LASD or OIR, about an investigation into his \n25  allegations of deputy violence. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-47- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELlEF \n\n1  I.  The Pattern Of Deputy-On-Inmate Violence In The Jails Has Been \n2  Ongoing For At Least A Dozen Years \n3  156.  In July 2009, after Phillip Westby got into an argument with \n4  another inmate in Twin Towers, deputies pulled him out ofbis cell and slammed \n5  his head into the wall.  Deputy O'Hardy handcuffed Mr. Westby and then slammed \n6  his head into the wall two more times.  Deputies O'Hardy and Sandoval then led \n7  Mr. Westby into the Outdoor Recreation area where they repeatedly punched him in \nS  the head, neck, and back, and then threw him to the ground.  Mr. Westby worried \n9  that his ribs were broken, but did not seek medical help because he feared \n10  retaliation from the deputies.  It took Mr. Westby's bruises almost two weeks to \n11  heal. \n12  157.  In October 200S, Deputy Cinderelli handcuffed Drequinn \n13  Johnson to transport him to a legal visit.  Deputy Cinderelli stopped Mr. Johnson in \n14  the hallway, near Deputy Grant, who was considered a \"rookie\" deputy.  Deputy \n15  Cinderelli said to Deputy Grant, \"This is training, this is when you get your first \n16  force,\" meaning his first use offorce incident.  Deputy Cinderellithen shoved \n17  Mr. Johnson against the wall and began punching him.  Mr. Johnson, who was still \nIS  handcuffed, fell to the ground, and Deputy Grant joined Deputy Cinderelli in \n19  punching and kicking him.  Two other deputies came over and joined the melee. \n20  The deputies shot Mr. Johnson with a taser twice in the arm.  After the incident, \n21  Mr. Johnson was unable to see out of his left eye for about two weeks.  When \n22  deputies interviewed Mr. Johnson about the incident, he said he did not remember \n23  what had happened, because he was afraid the deputies would hurt him again. \n24  ISS.  In February 200S, after Peter Johnson, who uses a wheelchair, \n25  complained about jail conditions, Deputies Ochoa, Reynoso, and Saldivar pulled \n26  him off his bed and kicked and kneed his ribs, back, and neck.  The deputies later \n27  shot pepper spray into MI. JohnRon's face and caused him to fall out of his \n2S  wheelchair.  The assault occurred in the wheelchair module in Men's Central Jail. \n-4S-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  159.  On or about December 30, 2007, a deputy repeatedly slammed \n2  Robert Powell's head into the wall, scratching and bruising his forehead, and left \n3  him outside in the cold.  At the time, Mr. Powell was 58 years old. \n4  160.  In June 2006, a deputy assaulted and raped Frank Mendoza, a \n5  gay inmate, in Twin Towers.  Earlier in the day, the same deputy was escorting a \n6  line of inmates including Mr. Mendoza and said to them \"you all walk: like girls.\" \n7  When Mr. Mendoza said to another inmate in the line, \"There's a male who's \n8  unsure of his masculinity,\" the deputy grabbed Mr. Mendoza, shoved him against \n9  the wall, and threatened him stating, \"You better watch it.  1 will show you my \n10    masculinity.  1 will come get you.\"  Later that day, when the inmates returned to \n11  their pod, Mr. Mendoza's cell door was left open.  Shortly after the deputy in the \n12  tower outside the pod left his post, the deputy who had previously threatened \n13  Mr. Mendoza forced him into his cell, tore off his clothes, threw him to the ground, \n14  shoved a gag in his mouth and raped him.  After the rape was over, Mr. Mendoza \n15  lay shivering and naked in his cell until another deputy found him and asked what \n16  had happened.  After Mr. Mendoza reported that he had been raped, the deputy \n17  responded, \"I do not see anything wrong with you.\"  No LASD personnel \n18  interviewed Mr. Mendoza about the incident or took any forensic evidence to \n19  investigate whether he had been raped.  Mr. Mendoza had been arrested for public \n20  drunkenness and was being held in LA County jail on a warrant for failure to \n21  appear that later proved to have been issued in error. \n22  161.  Mario Rocha is a 31 year old who is now pursuing his B.A. at \n23  George Washington University in Washington, D.C.  On October 10,2003, he was \n24  in jail on a charge that ultimately resulted in a reversed conviction.  Mr. Rocha was \n25  in a holding cell being processed for entry into the jail, when he observed a man in \n26  his late 50's or early 60's, who appeared to be mentally ill, on his hands and knees. \n27  Mr. Rocha saw a deputy race over, kick the man in the head, and start punching \n28  him.  Almost immediately, about four or five other deputies came over and joined \n-49- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTNE RELIEF \n\n1  in the assault; punching, stomping, and kicking the man while he lay on his \n2  stomach on the floor, not resisting and not even trying to shield himself from the \n3  deputies' blows.  The assault left the man bleeding from his face and the top of his \n4  head, with one of his eyes swollen shut. \n5  J.  Victims Of Deputy Abuse Experience Intimidation And \n6  Retaliation \n7  162.  There is a widespread fear among inmates at Men's Central Jail \n8  and Twin Towers of reporting deputy misdeeds to the ACLU, or anyone else, \n9  because deputies regularly retaliate against those who lodge complaints.  When \n10  inmates complain about mistreatment, deputies respond with punishment:  strip \n11  searches, body cavity searches, destructive cell shake-downs, confiscation of their \n12  belongings, or solitary confinement.  If inmates complain of being beaten, the \n13  Sheriffs Department will likely bring false disciplinary charges against them for \n14  assault against the deputies who beat them, and in some cases hand them over for \n15  criminal prosecution on the bogus charges. \n16  163.  In March 2011, after Mr. U told a nurse that a deputy had earlier \n17  refused to take him to his medical appointment, the deputy said to Mr. U, \"I can \n18  make it that you slip in the shower next time and need serious medical attention.\" \n19  164.  In January 2011, two deputies verbally and physically assaulted \n20  Shawn Meyers in an elevator for his interactions with ACLU representatives.  The \n21  deputies slammed Mr. Meyers, who uses a wheelchair, against the wall, and said, \n22  \"That's your warning.\" \n23  165.  In January 2011, Deputy Carbajal overheard inmate Mani Sadri \n24  complain about being threatened by another deputy.  Deputy Carbajal warned \n25  Mr. Sadri not to complain any more to ACLU, and threatened to have other inmates \n26  kill him.  Deputy Carbajal said, \"Don't complain to anyone if you want to make it \n27  out of here alive.\" \n28 \n-50- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  166.  In November and December 2010, in the Twin Towers, deputies \n2  repeatedly threatened Mr. V, whose criminal case had received extensive media \n3  coverage.  On one occasion, a module officer refused to give Mr. V a blanket, \n4  saying he did not \"give them to murderers.\"  Another deputy told him, \"[S]o you're \n5  [Mr. V].  I can't wait to get you to my floor.\"  When Mr. V was transferred to \n6  Men's Central Jail, Deputies Ibarra and another deputy repeatedly asked him what \n7  he was in jail for, and punched his ribs until he answered.  They called Mr. V a \n8  \"piece of shit,\" told him he would not receive basic necessities such as food, and \n9  said they would turn him over \"to the Southsiders,\" which Mr. V understood as a \n1 0  threat to tum him over to the Southsiders gang.  Deputy Ibarra told him not to \n11  complain about the incident, or the deputy would \"go in your cell and beat you up \n12  personally.\" \n13  167.  In June 2010, after Robert Dragusica spoke with the ACLU \n14  about violence inside Men's Central Jail, deputies began threatening and \n15  intimidating him.  The behavior of the deputies caused Mr. Dragusica to refuse two \n16  opportunities to speak with the ACL U again, because he was scared of what the \n17  deputies might do.  After eventually speaking with the ACLU a second time, \n18  deputies sent Mr. Dragusica to disciplinary segregation for a fabricated contraband \n19  charge. \n20  168.  Deputies sent another inmate to beat Emmanuel Benson in \n21  May 2009, after he reported that a guard had assaulted him the day before.  A \n22  deputy opened the door to Mr. Benson's cell in Men's CentralJail and allowed the \n23  other inmate to enter.  The inmate punched Mr. Benson twice in the face and told \n24  him he was sent because Mr. Benson reported the deputy's attack.  Mr. Benson did \n25  not request medical treatment in fear of further retaliation. \n26  169.  In March 2009, deputies severely beat Daysuan Rushing in \n27  retaliation for his speaking to the ACLU.  After Mr. Rushing spoke with an ACLU \n28  representative who visited his row, deputies delayed him as he returned from a \n-51\"  COMPLAINT FOR lNJUNCTNE RELIEF \n\n1  court appearance.  Mr. Rushing, who was restrained in waist chains, was forced up \n2  against a wall with his legs spread.  Deputy Zuniga slapped the back of his head \n3  twice and then kicked Mr. Rushing's leg, causing him to fall to the ground.  Deputy \n4  Zuniga and another officer began punching and kicking Mr. Rushing, and hit him \n5  repeatedly in the face and knees with a flashlight.  The deputies then pepper \n6  sprayed Mr. Rushing in the face and threw him down a flight of stairs.  While \n7  Mr. Rushing was laying on the ground bleeding, Deputy Zuniga said, \"You fucking \n8  whiners, tell this to the ACLU, I dare you.\"  As a result of the beating, Mr. Rushing \n9  received stitches on both sides of his face. \n10  170.  Deputies beat Mr. W in Men's Central Jail and he was \n11  subsequently refused pain medication that he was supposed to receive, because he \n12  had complained to the ACLU. \n13  17l.  Defendants Sheriff Baca and Chief Burns have long been aware \n14  of the Department's practice of retaliating against inmates, including a pattern of \n15  arresting the victims of staff beatings and initiating their prosecuti on for assault, \n16  without any meaningful internal investigation of the facts surrounding the incident. \n17  In 2010, the ACLU filed in Rutherford a motion for a protective order asking that \n18  Defendants and their agents be enjoined from retaliating against inmates for \n19  speaking with the ACLU.  That motion was accompanied by numerous declarations \n20  attesting to incidents of retaliation, including retaliation in the form of physical \n21  abuse.  Despite this knowledge, Defendants have denied that retaliation is a \n22  significant problem and have failed to adequately investigate the problem.  Instead, \n23  they have tolerated and encouraged staff to continue to arrest and request \n24  prosecution of inmates beaten in the jails.  Their continued acquiescence in this \n25  practice manifests deliberate indifference toward the rights of the Plaintiffs and all \n26  other inmates in the Jails. \n27  172.  In a November 2010 declaration, Chief Bums made a \n28  categorical statement under oath that \"every allegation of retaliation\" that the \n-52- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  ACLU had brought to LASD's attention that the Department had investigated \"has \n2  been determined to be without merit. ... [T]he Department takes allegations of \n3  retaliation and other deputy misconduct extremely seriously and such claims are \n4  always thoroughly investigated.,,41  On information and belief, this statement was \n5  false and Chief Burns knew it was false at the time he made it. \n6  173.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that Undersheriff \n7  Tanaka is also aware of this pattern of retaliation. \n8  174.  In its October 2011 report, the OIR stated that expectations that \n9  custody personnel will not engage in retaliation and the use of excessive force is not \n10  \"consistently reinforced up the chain of command\": \n11  \"[T]he key to preventing questionable force incidents and \n12  ensuring the fair treatment of inmates is in the hands of \n13  line-level supervisors.  If sergeants do not actively engage \n14  with those they supervise, deputies and custody assistants \n15  too  easily  can  lose  sight  of  the  expectations  the \n16  Department places  on  them  and  engage  in  the  type  of \n17  abusive, retaliatory conduct inmates frequently complain \n18  of.  The  Department  has  not  always  staffed  the  jails \n19  sufficiently to provide the necessary level of supervisory \n20  involvement,  and  its  expectation  of  sergeants  is  not \n42 \n21  consistently reinforced up the chain of command.\n22  K.

Incidents of deputy-on-\n2  inmate violence, after nominal or no investigation by LASD, are routinely reported \n3  by deputies as an unprovoked inmate-on-deputy assault, and if an inmate complains \n4  of being beaten or injured by jail deputies, those complaints are almost universally \n5  declared unfounded.  Most of these complaints get \"resolved\" at the lowest levels in \n6  the LASD.  Proper reporting procedures are routinely ignored. \n7  176.  Corrections expert Toni V. Bair reviewed the investigative \n8  procedures and policies of the Los Angeles County Jails and found them to be \n9  \"grossly substandard.,,43  For example, during the investigation of Use of Force \n10  incidents the supervisor of the attacking deputies often interviews the inmate \n44 \n11  victim, rather than an independent supervisor.\n12  177.  This practice is permitted by LASD policy, even though it is \n13  considered unacceptable and unprofessional by corrections experts. \n14  178.  Moreover, LASD sergeants and lieutenants often permit the very \n15  officers accused of assault to be present during the interview of the inmate for the \n16  use of force investigation, a tactic that has the purpose and effect of intimidating the \n17  inmate and impacting his testimony.  See, e.g., the August 2009 incident with \n18  inmate Gordon Grbavac, discussed in Paragraph 90 above.  Mr. Bair declared that \n19  this practice is \"unheard of in professionally conducted investigations and \n20  interviews,\" and stated that \"It is no wonder that the prisoner frequently ... alters \n21  his story so as not to implicate the officer(s) involved in the incident.,,45 \n22  179.  Even though pennitting a deputy who was involved in a force \n23  incident with an inmate to be present during the interview of the inmate is grossly \n24  unprofessional, LASD policy did not forbid this practice until the ACLU's 2011 \n25 \n26 \n43 Dec!. of Toni V.

The Los Angeles Times recently reported that according to an \n4  internal LASD memorandum, depllties were \"were crafting narratives 'dramatized \n5  to justify' force and delaying using weapons such as pepper spray that could end \n6  fights 'to dispense appropriate jailhouse justice. \",46 \n7  181.  In 2011, a correctional expert in an inmate's excessive force \n8  case against Sheriff Baca noted both false reports by deputies and the complete \n9  absence of an after-the-fact review of a serial cell extraction in Men's Central Jail, \n47 \nlOin which deputies injured a number of inmates. The report stated, among other \n11  things, that with respect to the deputies' documentation of the use of force, \"some \n12  crucial reports are missing, others are substantially incomplete and still other \n13  reports are inaccurate or false.\"48  In addition, the report stated:  \"One ofthe most \n14  disturbing aspects of this incident is that there was apparently not so much as a \n15  cursory review of the situation, let alone a serious investigation\" by supervisors of \n16  what led to the disturbance on the cell block and the response that culminated in the \n17  serial cell extractions\"9 \n18  182.  In its 2011 report, the OIR stated \"too often we have found\" that \n19  \"the investigations of force incidents that result in less serious or no apparent \n20  injuries to the inmate\" are \"lackluster, sometimes slanted, and insufficiently \n21  thorough. \n,,50 \n22 \n23 \n24  46 Robert Faturechi & Jack Leonard,SheriffBaca Was Warned about Jail Deputies \nConduct, Retiree Says, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 1, 2011, available at \n25  http://artic1es.latimes.coml20 1 I/dec/01l10callla-me-jail-commander-20 11120 1-1 \n{hereinafter SheriffBaca Was Warned]. \n26  7 Expert Report of Jef£tey Schwartz, Feb. 8, 20 II, fLIed in Ramirez v.

Former FBI Executive Thomas Parker concluded that there are \nD \n2  \"systemic institutional actions to cover  up\" the longstanding pattern of unchecked \n3  deputy-on-inmate violence at the jails. \n4  184.  The institutional cover-ups often take the form of filing criminal \n5  charges against inmate victims of deputy violence.  The odds are low of an inmate \n6  winning an acquittal against the sworn testimony of deputy witnesses.  A criminal \n7  conviction of the inmate for his \"assault\" on the deputy - in reality, the deputy's \n8  assault on the imnate - results in a complete immunization of the deputy assailants \n9  and the Department for from civil liability for the assault. \n10  185.  In January 2011, James Parker, an inmate whom ACLU Jails \n11  Project Coordinator Esther Lim witnessed being brutally beaten and tasered by \n12  Deputies Ochoa and Hirsch, was subsequently charged with battery against a peace \nl3  officer and resisting a peace officer.  For additional examples of trumped-up \n14  charges filed against victims of deputy abuse, see, e.g., Paragraphs 54 - 60 \n15  (Macario Garcia), 115 (Mr. M), and 125 (Evan Tutt) above. \n16  186.  The Department has even charged visitors to the Jails in this \n17  fashion.  As discussed in Paragraph 69, Gabriel Carillo was assaulted by deputies \n18  while visiting his brother in Men's Central Jail in February 2011.  In April, 2001, \n19  he was charged with resisting and officer and battery.51  The District Attorney later \n20  dismissed the charges against him after the ACLU issued its 2011 Annual Report \n21  and the Los Angeles Times revealed that the FBI was investigating deputy-on-\n22  inmate abuse in the jails. \n23  187.  In contrast, LASD frequently chooses not to forward to the \n24  District Attorney information about deputies who have been disciplined or even \n25  terminated for using excessive force against inmates.  As the Los Angeles Times \n26  reported:  \"In several cases in recent years, deputies who were disciplined or even \n27 \nThe People v.

Defendants Have Actual Knowledge Of Deputy Violence And \n5  Have Failed To Take Reasonable Measures To Avert It \n6  188.  Rampant violence at the Jails has resulted from a failure of \n7  leadership at the top level of the Department.  Such a pervasive, deeply-entrenched, \n8  and notorious pattern of excessive force could not have continued unabated over a \n9  period of many years without a code of silence on the part of front-line and \n10  supervisory staff, combined with management staffs failure to require \n11  accountability, and their engaging in outright cover-up.53 \n12  189.  Despite overwhelming evidence of the culture of deputy-on-\n13  inmate violence, SheriffBaca, Undersheriff Tanaka, and Chief Bums have \n14  stubbornly refused to acknowledge the problem.  They and their spokespeople have \n15  publicly taken the position that victims' allegations have been investigated \n16  thoroughly and found to be false, and they have attacked the credibility of civilian \n17  witnesses to deputy violence.  On information and belief, they have routinely \n18  dismissed inmates' complaints of staff beatings, even when the deputies allegedly \n19  involved had failed to report a use of force and the inmate was seriously injured; \n20  when the inmate's injuries were obviously more serious than the staff accounts of \n21  their actions would suggest; and when the same deputies reported essentially the \n22  same scenarios over and over to describe incidents in which different inmates were \n23  injured. \n24 \n52 Jack Leonard & Robert Faturechi, D.A. in the Dark on Jail Probes, Los Angeles \n25  Times, Dec. 4, 2011, available at http://articles.latimes.comJ2011/dec/04/I0callla \nme-jails-da-201l1205. \n26  53 \"The only way in which an established pattern of inappropriate use of force can \nbe maintained is through a combination of a code of silence on the part of front-line \n27  and supervisory staff and a managcmcnt staff posturc of lack of accountability or \noutriglit cover-up.\"  Jeffrey A. Schwartz, Fixing Use-afForce Problems, American \n28  Jails {201 0). \n-5 7- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  190.  Sheriff Baca has failed or refused to hold accountable high-\n2  ranking supervisors in the face of significant nonfeasance and malfeasance by these \n3  supervisors and by the officers they oversee.  Both Chief of Custody Operations \n4  Rums and Undersheriff Tanaka remain in the positions they held, or have been \n5  promoted, despite the epidemic of deputy on inmate abuse in the jails that Sheriff \n6  Baca is aware occurred over the past years. \n7  191.  With rare exception, deputies whose misconduct is brought to \n8  the attention of supervisory persounel continue to work with inmates in \n9  Department-operatedjails without any substantial disciplinary action being taken \n10  against them. \n11  192.  The fact that physical abuse by officers remains unchecked and \n12  unrestrained leads the staff to believe that inmates may be beaten with impunity. \n13  SheriffBaca's actions and omissions have created the perception among high-\n14  ranking supervisors in the Sheriff's Department that a supervisor who turns a blind \n15  eye towards evidence of staff misuse offorce and fails to investigate incidents in \n16  which inmates are injured by staffwill suffer no damage to his or her career. \n17  193.  In September 2011, the release of the ACLU's annual report on \n18  the Los Angeles County Jails, detailing some seventy recent instances of extreme \n19  deputy violence against inmates and other serious abuse of inmates, and press \n20  reports of an FBI probe involving deputy violence in the Jails, set off a media \n21  storm.  SheriffBaca responded by dismissing any possibility of a systemic problem, \n22  and with wildly inconsistent and self-serving statements about his lack of \n23  awareness of the problem. \n24  194.  SheriffBaca first flatly denied the existence of a systemic \n25  problem.  Nicole Nishida, one of the sheriff's spokespersons, said that the \n26  department thoroughly investigated all complaints of abuse that it received and that \n27  most were unsubstantiated.54 \n28  Jennifer Medina, Report Details Wide Abuse in Los Angeles Jail System, N.Y. \n54 \n-58- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  195.  As public criticism of Sheriff Baca continued to mount, and new \n2  allegations surfaced, the Sheriff acknowledged there were widespread problem but \n3  claimed that he had not been aware of its existence.  As reported on October 10, \n4  2011, Defendant Baca stated:  \"Weare going to look into this and we welcome \n5  anyone to look into it as well.\"  He contended that \"[t]he widespread problem can't \n6  be defined until we lmow what all the issues are.,,55 \n7  196.  On October 16,2011, the Sheriff told the Los Angeles Times that \n8  his cotmnand staff occasionally left him in the dark about the Jails' problems.  \"I \n9  wasn't ignoring the jails.  1 just didn't know,\" Baca said.  \"People can say, 'What \n10  the hell kind of leader is that?' The truth is 1 should've known.  So now I do \n11  knoW.,,56 \n12  197.  Finally, in early December 2011, it came to light that Sheriff \n13  Baca and other senior officials in LASD had in fact lmown of the pattern of \n14  widespread deputy violence in the Jails for years.  Robert Olmsted, a retired top \n15  LASD official with supervisory authority over Men's Central Jail, had repeatedly \n16  informed SheriffBaca of such problems.  The Los Angeles Times reported on \n17  December 1: \n18  A  top commander in Los Angeles County's jail system \n19  said he warned Sheriff Lee Baca and other senior officials \n20  last  year  about  deputies  using  excessive  force  against \n21  inmates but was ignored until the problems grew into a \n22  public scandal. \n23  In an interview with The Times, Robert Olmsted said he \n24  Times, Sept. 28, 2011, available at ht1:p://www.nytimes.coml201l/09128/us/aclu \nsuit- details-wide-abuse-in-Ios-angeles-j ail-system.html?  r= 1&  pagewanted=all. \n25  55 Jeunifer Medina, Pressed, Sheriff Agrees to Jails InquTry  N.Y.

He \n3  also  voiced  concern  about  deputies  forming  aggressive \n4  cliques. \n5  He alleged that two top officials rebuffed him, telling him \n6  it  was  impossible  to  change  the  deputy  culture  in  the \n7  downtown L.A. lockup, an antiquated facility that houses \n8  some of the county's most dangerous inmates. \n9  Olmsted,  a 32-year department veteran who retired  late \n10  last  year,  had  commissioned  several  confidential  audits \n11  and  internal  memos  that  found  serious  problems  with \n12  excessive force and inadequate supervision in the jail.  He \n13  said top sheriffs officials seemed not to take his concerns \n14  seriously. \n15 \n16  \"It's frustrating knowing that this never, ever needed to \n17  have occurred,\" Olmsted said.  \"There was a systematic \n18  failure ofleadership.\" \n19 \n20  Olmsted  said  he  twice  approached  Baca to  discuss  the \n21  problems at Men's Central Jail.  The frrst time was at a \n22  department barbecue.  Baca, he said, told him he would \n23  be in touch but never followed up. \n24  Months later,  Olmsted said, he  spoke to  the sheriff at a \n25  charity food giveaway.  The event occurred soon after a \n26  group  of Men's  Central  Jail  deputies  had  been  caught \n27  fighting  each  other  at  an  off-duty,  department  holiday \n28  party.  After the brawl, sheriffs officials said some of the \n-60- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  deputies  had  formed  a  clique  whose  members  flashed \n2  gang-like hand signs. \n3  Olmsted said he told the sheriff he wanted to discuss how \n4  to  improve  supervision  at  the  jail  to  prevent  similar \n5  problems in the future.  Baca, he said, agreed to talk but \n6  again never followed through.57 \n7  198.  Commander Olmsted raised the issue of unchecked violence not \n8  only with Defendant Baca but also with Defendants Burns and Tanaka: \n9  Burns,  he  said,  told  him the jail's culture  could not be \n10  changed.  Frustrated, Olmsted said he tookhis concerns in \n11  the  summer  of  2010  to  Asst.  Sheriff  Marvin  O. \n12  Cavanaugh, who was sympathetic but told him the same \n13  thing.  He also spoke to then-Asst.  Sheriff Paul Tanaka, \n14  who as  undersheriff now runs the day-to-day operations \n58 \n15  of the department.\n16  199.  Witness LA reported:  \"In a series of interviews with the LA \n17  Justice Report, Olmsted [stated] ... '[T]he real problem is how departmental \n18  leadership allowed this jail situation to occur. '\"  \"The problems inside the jail were \n19  ignored by the Sheriffs command staff.  I went to [Custody Chief Dennis] Burns, \n20  [Undersheriff Paul] Tanaka.  And I went to Lee Baca.  I told them I needed help \n21  trying to corral this situation and I was ignored.\"59 \n22  200.  Commander Olmsted also found, as early as 2009, that reported \n23  use of force was not being properly investigated and the official paperwork \n24 \n25 \nSheriffBaca Was Warned, supra note 42. \n57 \n26  58Id. \n59 Matthew Fleischer; Dangerous Jails, Part 2: Ignoring the Warnings, WitnessLA, \n27  Dec. 1,2011, availaDle at http://witnessla.com/sheriff-Iee \nbaca/20ll/adminidangerous-.Jails-part-2-ignoring-the-warnings-by-matt-fleischerl \n28  (emphasis omitted). \n-61-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  reporting incidents of deputy force at Men's Central Jail-the so-called \"use of \n2  force packets\" - were not being properly prepared: \n3  201.  Olmsted found that, not only were many force packages not \n4  being investigated, the ones that were cleared were often given only cursory \n5  examination.  Olmsted had one of his lieutenants pul130 force reports at random \n6  that were in various stages of oversight. A second lietenant [sic], Mark McCorkle, \n7  analyzed them.  All were either signed off on, or were on the verge of being \n8  cleared.  Yet of that group ono, 18 uses offorce were questionable in nature and \n9  conceivably fell outside of department policy.60  Commander Olmsted raised the \n10  issue of inadequate investigations of use offorce with command staff, including \n11  Defendants Burns and Tanaka - all of whom ignored the issue.  Olmsted took \n12  McCorlde's finding regarding inadequate use offorce investigations up the chain of \n13  command to Custody Chief Dennis Burns, Assistant Sheriff in charge of custody, \n61 \n14  Marvin Cavanaugh, and Paul Tanaka.  No action was taken.\n15  202.  In response to these latest revelations from Commander \n16  Olmsted, SheriffBaca, rather than accepting responsibility, publicly laid the blame \n17  on Commander Olmsted for not solving the problem.  Commander Olmsted didn't \n62 \n18  need to \"ask permission to solve the problem,\" Baca said. The Los Angeles Times \n19  commented, on December 2, 2011 : \n20  Never  mind  that  a  quasi-military  organization  like  the \n21  Sheriffs Department is  all about following the chain of \n22  command.  Or that Baca is trying to have it both ways, \n23  suggesting that his command staff failed him by shielding \n24  him from the truth, and at the same time blaming Olmsted \n25  for not talcing care of the problem on his own. \n26  How many times can Baca plead ignorance?  This is just \n27  60 rd. \n61 ill. \n28  SFieriffBaca Was Warned, supra note 42. \n62 \n-62- COMPLAINT FOR INTIJNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  the latest in a series of objectionable responses that calls \n2  into question whether he is capable of running, let alone \n3  refonning, the nation's largest jail systemY \n4  203.  According to Commander Olmsted, when he took the evidence \n5  of inadequate investigations of use of force incidents to Chief Bums, Chief Bums \n6  did not deny there was a problem, but told Olmsted that the jail's culture could not \n7  be changed.64 \n8  204.  Despite their knowledge ofthe serious problem of improper and \n9  excessive use of force in the jails, Defendants have repeatedly failed to take \n10  reasonable steps to address the problem. \n11  205.  Defendants have failed to put in place adequate policies \n12  governing use of force.  The Department's policies are grossly lacking in specificity \n13  about typical force scenarios that are likely to arise in the jails and the proper way \n14  for custody perso=el to handle those situations. \n15  206.  The force policies remain severely inadequate even after the few \n16  changes to force policies that the Defendants have implemented since the release of \n17  the ACLU's 2011 report. \n18  207.  The insufficiency ofthe force policies makes it almost \n19  impossible to train deputies adequately on the proper use of force. \n20  208.  Sheriff Baca has failed to install cameras in Twin Towers and \n21  Men's Central Jail, even though he has stated as far back as 2005 that he pla=ed to \n22  install security cameras in Men's Central Jail.65  In 2011, after the ACLU released \n23  its A=ual Report on abuse in the jails, Sheriff Baca admitted that scores of cameras \n24 \n25 \nEditorial, Baca 's Jails Are Baca 's Problem:  Sheriff Lee Baca Should Stop \n63 \n26  Blaming Others and Take Responsibility for Fixing L.A.

SheriffBaca, Undersheriff Tanaka, and Chief Bums have failed \n4  to implement a system for identifying, logging, and tracking incidents of use of \n5  force by deputies and complaints by inmates of use of force by deputies in the LA \n6  County jail. \n7  210.  For the past five years, the Los Angeles Police Department has \n8  had a computerized system, TEEMS II, capable of both tracking use offorce \n9  information and providing early warning by identifying officers involved in \n10  multiple use of force incidents.  Even though LAPD and numerous other law \n11  enforcement agencies have such tracking and early warning systems, on \n12  information and belief, Defendants either have not designed their Facility \n13  Automated Tracking System (F.A.S.T.) or Persounel Performance Index to perform \n14  this function for deputies working in the Custody Division, or they have failed to \n15  obtain this information from one or both systems, to reduce the number of incidents \n16  of excessive or uunecessary use of force in the Jails.  Nor have they created a \n17  system that tracks inmate complaints about use of force by deputies in the jails. \n18  211.  Defendant Bums has been and is aware of the failures of the \n19  Department's tracking systems.  When the ACLU sought a court order in 2010 \n20  requiring that complaints of retaliation, including identifying the officer(s) who are \n21  the subject of such allegations be tracked in F.A.S.T., Chief Bums submitted a \n22  sworn declaration to the Court stating, \"the FAST was not designed properly to \n23  track information about deputy misconduct.\" \n24  212.  A tracking system of this kind is a basic tool for ensuring that all \n25  incidents of use of force are properly reviewed and investigated and are commonly \n26  used by large jail systems.  The lack of such a system makes it difficult to compile \n27 \n28  Baca Says He Was out a/Touch, supra note 52. \n66 \n-64-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  the essential data to detect and address problematic patterns of use of force as they \n2  develop. \n3  213.  Defendants Baca, Tanaka, and Bums have failed to develop and \n4  implement a policy of zero tolerance for deputy violence and abuse of inmates. \n5  Then-Assistant Sheriff Tanaka was informed as far back as 2006 by the Captain of \n6  Men's Central Jail that there was a problem with improper use of force by deputies \n7  at Men's Central Jail.  At that time, Captain Clark also expressed concern about \n8  deputy gangs in the jail to Tanaka.  When Captain Clark proposed to set up a \n9  rotation system to attempt to break up the deputy gangs, Tanaka transferred Clark \n10  out of Men's Central Jail. \n11  214.  When Assistant Sheriff Tanaka informed Mr. Olmsted that he \n12  was being made the Captain in charge of Men's Central Jail, Tanaka told Olmsted \n13  that use of force was a problem in the jail. \n14  215.  When Sheriff Baca promoted Olmsted to Commander in the \n15  Custody Division, then Assistant Sheriff Tanaka arranged for Dan Cruz to become \n16  the Captain at MCJ, even though it was well-known within the LASD that Cruz had \n17  been transferred out of the Le=ox Station for being about 18 months behind on his \n18  paperwork, including his review of use-of-force complaints.  Tanaka nonetheless \n19  placed him in a facility where he knew there were problems with use of force. \n20  216.  Although Defendants have been repeatedly warned that use of \n21  force by deputies is disproportionately directed at inmates with mental illness, \n22  Defendants have failed to implement numerous recommendations on training and \n23  other appropriate steps to reduce force against mentally ill inmates made by experts. \n24  217.  Defendants have abjectly failed to  develop policies that address \n25  the problem of endemic brutality in the Jails.  Policies regarding use of force, \n26  investigation of use of force, discipline for deputies who have used excessive force \n27  or failed to report use of force, supervisors who have mishandled investigations of \n28  force, and training of deputies and supervisors all fail to meaningfully address the \n-65-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  problem.  When allegations of deputy violence arise, they are infrequently \n2  investigated, and deputies are rarely disciplined.  Defendants have failed to track \n3  incidents of violence, even though systems for doing so are readily available and \n4  commonly used.  In this way, Defendants have fostered a pattern and practice of \n5  deputy violence against inmates, which places inmates at a significant, ongoing risk \n6  of serious and irreparable injury.  Deputies and supervisors alike have come believe \n7  that committing abuse (or failing to investigate abuse) will have absolutely no \n8  impact on one's career.  As a result, physical abuse by deputies continues \n9  unchecked.  The persistent failure or refusal of Sheriff Baca and the other \n10  Defendants to supervise deputies properly or take action to curb the misconduct \n11  demonstrates Defendants' deliberate indifference to the Plaintiffs' right to \n12  reasonable protection from harm. \n13  V.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n14  218.  Plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin bring this action, pursuant to \n15  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b )(2), on behalf of all present and \n16  future inmates confmed in the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles:  Men's \n17  Central Jail, Twin Towers, and the IRC.  Inmates assigned to Men's Central Jail \n18  and Twin Towers spend some period oftime in the IRC, and it is commonplace for \n19  inmates to be transferred back and forth between Men's Central Jail and Twin \n20  Towers.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent meets the requirements of Rule \n21  23 as follows: \n22  A.  NlJMEROSITY \n23  219.  The class meets the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(l). \n24  There are more than 4,000 inmates confined within Men's Central Jail and about \n25  2,800 inmates in the Twin Towers at any given time.  Between 500 to 1,000 men \n26  are processed into or out of the jails through the IRC on any given day.  The \n27  membership of the class continuously changes, rendering joinder of all members \n28 \n-66-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  impracticable.  The inclusion within the class of future inmates in the downtown \n2  Jail Complex also makes joinder of all members impracticable. \n3  B.  COMMONALITY \n4  220.  The class meets the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). \n5  Questions of law and fact presented by the named plaintiffs are common to other \n6  members of the class.  The common contentions that W1i.te the claims of the class \n7  include the following: \n8  (A)  There is an unlawful pattern and practice at the Jails of \n9  excessive physical violence used by Sheriff's deputies against inmates. \n10  (B)  There is an unlawful pattern and practice at the Jails of \n11  Sheriff's deputies enlisting and encouraging inmates to carry out savage attacks. \n12  against other inmates and promoting inmate-on-inmate violence. \n13  (C)  There is an unlawful pattern and practice at the Jails of \n14  Sheriff's deputies using violence and threats of violence to coerce false statements \n15  from inmates, to cover up unlawful violence and to intimidate inmates and thereby \n16  prevent inmates from making complaints or otherwise reporting abuse at these \n17  facilities. \n18  (D)  SheriffBaca, Undersheriff Tanaka, Assistant Sheriff \n19  Rhambo, and Chief Burns are aware of and deliberately indifferent to the use of \n20  excessive force by correctional officers and the enlisting and encouraging of \n21  inmates to carry out savage attacks in the Jails.  They acquiesce in and condone this \n22  conduct by failing to investigate it, failing to take reasonable measures to end the \n23  culture of deputy violence that fosters it, failing to pW1i.sh deputies who engage in \n24  it, protecting those deputies from criminal prosecution, and rewarding such deputies \n25  for their conduct. \nc. \n26  TYPICALITY \n27  221.  Plaintiffs meet the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3), \n28  since, as alleged below, the claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class. \n-67-\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  222.  Plaintiff Alex Rosas, twenty-four years old, is currently housed \n2  in Twin TowersY  On July 22,2011, Mr. Rosas witnessed a group of deputies, \n3  including Defendants Luviano, Guerrerro, Bearer, and Ibarra, severely beating a \n4  non-resisting inmate, Arturo Fernandez, who was clad only in boxer shorts and had \n5  his hands cuffed behind his back.  As the deputies pummeled the handcuffed \n6  Fernandez, they shouted that he was resisting, although he was not.  The deputies \n7  then dragged Fernandez away. \n8  223.  An hour after Mr. Rosas witnessed the beating, Deputies Ibarra \n9  and Luviano came to his cell and warned him, \"You better not say anything.\" \n10  Mr. Rosas told the deputies that he had not seen anything.  Mr. Rosas was afraid \n11  that they would hurt him or arrange for other inmates to attack him. \n12  224.  A few days later, Deputies Ibarra and Luviano again came to \n13  Mr. Rosas's cell and threatened him not to say anything.  Terrified that something \n14  would happen to him, Mr. Rosas told them again that he had not seen anything. \n15  225.  On August 9, 2011, Deputies Bearer and Ibarra came to \n16  Mr. Rosas's cell and told him to \"cuff up,\" meaning to allow himself to be \n17  handcuffed.  When Mr. Rosas asked the deputies why he needed to be cuffed, they \n18  responded that another inmate had given them a tip that Mr. Rosas had \"something\" \n19  in his cell and that they were \"going to toss up your cell.\"  The deputies handcuffed \n20  him and sat him outside in the main hallway. \n21  226.  A few minutes later the deputies moved Mr. Rosas away from \n22  the door and out of the sightline of other inmates.  They told him they had found a \n23  \"slicer\" - a razor fashioned into a weapon - in his cell.  Mr. Rosas told the deputies \n24  that he had not altered any razors and that the weapon did not belong to him. \n25  Deputy Luviano asked Mr. Rosas, \"Why are you lying to my deputies?\"  Mr. Rosas \n26  responded, \"I'm not lying, sir.\"  The deputies punched him in the back of the head \n27  LASD has transferred all Men's Central Jail inmates who submitted affidavits to \n67 \nthe Court in Rutherford v.

Later, deputies came to Mr. Rosas's cell with the disciplinary \n4  paperwork.  They told Mr. Rosas that ifhe admitted on the form that he had the \nrum \n5  slicer they would \"make trus easier\" for  and would not \"add on any charges.\" \n6  He understood tills to mean that ifhe lied and said he possessed a slicer then he \n7  would not be taken to disciplinary segregation and the deputies would not falsely \n8  charge him with assault on an officer.  Mr. Rosas refused to sign the paperwork, \n9  and the deputies escorted rum to the hole. \n10  228.  Mr. Rosas asked Deputy Reza for a complaint form, but Deputy \nII  Reza refused to give him one.  Mr. Rosas told the deputy he would ask the \n12  afternoon sruft deputies for a complaint form and Deputy Reza responded that he \n13  would tell the afternoon sruft not to give him the form.  When Mr. Rosas asked the \n14  afternoon sruft deputies for the complaint form, they too refused to give him a form. \nIS  229.  Plaintiff Jonathan Goodwin, 29 years old, is in an inmate in \n16  Los Angeles County Jails.  He is currently housed in Twin Towers. \n17  230.  On July 22, 2011, when Mr. Goodwin was housed at Men's \n18  Central Jail on the 3000 floor, he saw several deputies running towards a row of \n19  cells.  He saw deputies leading inmate Arturo Fernandez in handcuffs and then \n20  punching rum and slamming him to the ground.  Mr. Fernandez fell on his face, \n21  with his hands cuffed behind his back.  Several deputies, including Deputies \n22  Luviano and Ibarra, punched Mr. Fernandez on rus lower back and the sides ofrus \n23  torSo.  Another deputy kneed Mr. Fernandez in the back, as if pressing the air out of \n24  his lungs.  Mr. Fernandez yelled that he couldn't breathe.  The deputies told rum to \n25  \"Shut the fuck up!\"  After the group of deputies punched and kicked Mr. Fernandez \n26  countless times, Deputies Ibarra and Luviano escorted Mr. Fernandez out of the \n27  housing module. \n28 \n-69- COMPLAINT FOR INWNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  231.  On August 10,2011, Deputy Luviano came to Mr. Goodwin's \n2  cell and told him to \"cuff up.\"  When Mr. Goodwin asked why, Deputy Luviano \n3  responded that it was because he could \"do whatever the fuck I want\" and that \n4  Mr. Goodwin \"got no rights.\"  Deputy Luviano handcuffed Mr. Goodwin behind \n5  his back and escorted him to the hallway. \n6  232.  In the hallway, Deputy Luviano pushed Mr. Goodwin against \n7  the wall and kicked his legs open.  Correctional Assistant Flannigan then \n8  approached and kicked Mr. Goodwin's ankle and punched his lower back.  Deputy \n9  Luviano punched Mr. Goodwin in the back ofthe head.  Other inmates exclaimed \n10  that they saw what Deputy Luviano as doing. _Custody Assistant Flannigan yelled \n11  down the row, \"You saw that?  Whatcha gonna do about it?\"  Deputy Luviano and \n12  Correctional Assistant Wendlent then pulled Mr. Goodwin out of the view of other \n13  inmates.  Deputy Luviano repeatedly punched Mr. Goodwin on the back of the \n14  head, even when other deputies walked into the area. \n15  233.  Deputy Luviano then moved around Mr. Goodwin and began to \n16  punch him repeatedly in the jaw.  Mr. Goodwin sank to the ground and tried to roll \n17  away from Deputy Luviano.  Deputy Luviano continued to punch him in the jaw, \n18  and other deputies then joined in the beating. \n19  234.  The deputies continued to beat Mr. Goodwin until Deputy \n20  Ujolla and Sergeant Soto entered the room and escorted him away.  Mr. Goodwin \n21  told Deputy Bearer and Sergeant Soto that the deputies had beaten him. \n22  Mr. Goodwin was later interviewed on camera and repeated his account ofthe \n23  incident.  During the interview, Mr. Goodwin felt that Sergeant Soto was trying to \n24  misstate the facts and put words in his mouth to make it appear that he was lying. \n25  235.  Deputies took Mr. Goodwin to the medical clinic, where he \n26  reported that he was experiencing pain in his jaw and back molars.  Medical staff \n27  told Mr. Goodwin there was swelling in his head, yet he received no medical \n28 \n-70- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  treatment.  Later that night, Mr. Goodwin lost a back molar that had been knocked \n2  loose during the attack. \n3  236.  On August 12,2011, staff charged Mr. Goodwin with \n4  possession of contraband, insubordination and causing a disturbance, profanity \n5  toward staff and inmates, and refusal to follow orders. \n6  D.  ADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \n7  237.  Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives and thus meet the \n8  requirements of Rule 23 (a)(4).  Rosas and Goodwin are presently incarcerated \n9  within the Jails at issue in this case, they have no conflict of interest with other \n10  class members, and they will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n11  They are represented by highly qualified and experienced counsel:  The ACLU \n12  National Prison Project, the ACLU of Southern California, and Paul Hastings, LLP, \n13  as alleged below. \n14  238.  The ACLU National Prison Project and the ACLU of Southern \n15  California already serve as class counsel for all prisoners in the Los Angeles \n16  County Jails in Rutherford v. Baca, a case concerning over-crowding in the Jails. \n17  The ACLU also serves as court-appointed monitor in that case, and over a period of \n18  more than five years has conducted weekly or bi-weekly monitoring tours of Men's \n19  Central Jail.  Class counsel has sought to obtain discovery on deputy-on-inmate \n20  abuse in Rutherford and moved to compel production of that discovery after \n21  Defendants refused to turn it over.  The Court has never ruled on that motion to \n22  compel, which was submitted in December 2010.  Class counsel has also informed \n23  the Court of its intent to litigate the issue of deputy violence in an evidentiary \n24  hearing in Rutherford, but the Court has questioned whether the scope of the \n25  Rutherford judgment encompasses that issue.  The ACLU is thus uniquely well \n26  acquainted with the issues of deputy violence in the Jails and well equipped to \n27  litigate those claims.  Their work in Rutherford on the issues of deputy violence and \n28  overcrowding helped trigger a broad criminal investigation by the FBI and the U.S. \n-71- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  Attorney's office, and was a key factor in the decision of the County Board of \n2  Supervisors in November 2011 to convene a Commission to study the causes of \n3  deputy violence in the Jails. \n4  239.  Plaintiffs' co-lead counsel Margaret Winter is the Associate \n5  Director ofthe National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. \n6  Since 1973, the ACLU National Prison Project has been the only organization \n7  litigating prisoners' rights cases throughout the nation.  Attorney Winter has \n8  litigated prisoners' rights cases, most ofthem class actions, in federal courts in \n9  Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, Idaho, Maryland, \n10  Delaware, and Vermont, and in the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth,  and Eleventh \n11  Circuit Courts of Appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court.  She has argued and won a \n12  prisoner's rights case in the U.S. Supreme Court.  Since 2007, Winter has served as \nl3  co-lead class counsel for all the inmates in Los Angeles County Jails in \n14  Rutherford v. Baca \n15  240.  Plaintiffs' co-lead counsel Peter Eliasberg is the Legal Director \n16  of the ACLU Foundation of Southern California.  Since its founding in 1923, the \n17  ACLU of Southern California has been litigating a broad variety of civil rights \n18  cases, including prisoners' rights cases.  Attorney Eliasberg has been lead counsel \n19  or co-lead counsel in numerous federal civil rights class actions in the Central \n20  District of California and has been lead counsel in civil rights matters before the \n21  United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the California Supreme Court, \n22  and the United States Supreme Court, and has argued a case before the U.S. \n23  Supreme Court.  Since 2009, Eliasberg has served as co-lead class counsel for all \n24  the inmates in Los Angeles County Jails in Rutherford v. Baca. \n25  241.  Paul Hastings LLP is an international law firm with 18 offices. \n26  Paul Hastings currently has 1,029 attorneys worldwide, including 148 attorneys in \n27  the Los Angeles office.  Paul Hastings is a global law firm and has sufficient \n28  resources to adequately represent the class.  Paul Hastings has been recognized \n-72- COMPLA1NT FOR INJUNCT1VE RELIEF \n\n1  widely for its work on pro bono cases.  The American Lawyer recently ranked Paul \n2  Hastings second in the nation in the American Lawyer Pro Bono Report 0/2011.  In \n3  2010, the firm was honored as the Pro Bono Law FilTIl of the Year by Public \n4  Counsel, the world's largest pro bono public interest law fiITIl.  The Los Angeles \n5  office of Paul Hastings was awarded the 2010 Pro Bono Service A ward by the \n6  Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, as the top pro bono law finn in Los Angeles. \n7  Paul Hastings has extensive experience in class action litigation, including class \n8  action lawsuits involving civil rights.  In 2009, Paul Hastings worked with the \n9  ACLU of Southern California in a civil rights class action which rectified \n10  unconstitutional and unsafe conditions in an immigration detention center.  Paul \n11  Hastings has also recently argued and won a civil rights case before the U.S. \n12  Supreme Court. \n13  242.  Plaintiffs meet the requirement of Rule 23(b )(2), as Defendants \n14  have acted, or omitted to act, on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \n15  making injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n16  VI.  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n17  243.  Both of the named Plaintiffs have exhausted available \n18  administrative remedies. \n19  244.  On August 24,2011, Mr. Goodwin filled out an inmate \n20  complaint fonn stating, among other things, \"On August 24,2011, Deputy Luviano \n21  and Correctional Assistant Flannigan and other deputies beat me up.\"  The form \n22  was delivered that day to both Watch Commander Limon and Deputy Alvarez at \n23  Men's Central Jail. \n24  245.  No one from LASD has ever provided Mr. Goodwin with a \n25  response to the complaint or informed him .that the LASD was seeking an \n26  additional 15 days to complete its investigation of the complaint. \n27  246.  On August 24,2011 Mr. Rosas filled out an inmate complaint \n28  form stating, among other things, that on \"8/9/2011 Deputy Luviano punched me,\" \n-73- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  which was provided to Watch Commander Limon and Deputy Alvarez at Men's \n2  Central Jail. \n3  247.  A few days later Senior Deputy Lauderdale approached \n4  Mr. Rosas, showed him the complaint form and asked him what it was about.  At \n5  no point has any LASD personnel provided Mr. Rosas a response to the complaint \n6  or informed him that the LASD was seeking an additional 15 days to complete its \n7  investigation ofthe complaint. \n8  248.  LASD policy provides that the department shall investigate all \n9  complaints within 15 days of their being filed unless the department notifies the \n10  inmate in writing that it is seeking an additional 15 days to complete the \n11  investigation.  Both Plaintiffs filed their complaints more than 90 days ago without \n12  receiving any response from LASD personnel. \n13  VII.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n14  A.  Eighth Amendment To The United States Constitution; 42 U.S.c. \n15  Section 1983 \n16  249.  By reason of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 - 248, \n17  supra, plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin, and the class they represent, were deprived \n18  and continue to be deprived by Defendants of their rights, under the Eighth and \n19  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, to due process oflaw \n20  and to be free from gratuitous and excessive force, threats of gratuitous and \n21  excessive force, degrading and sadistic treatment. \n22  250.  The failures of Defendants Baca, Tanaka, and Burns to take \n23  appropriate steps to curb the widespread pattern of brutality in Men's Central Jail, \n24  the Twin Towers, and the IRC, as described in this Complaint, constitutes \n25  deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' basic need for reasonable protection from harm \n26  and violates Plaintiffs' rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, \n27  including physical abuse and intimidation, degrading, cruel, and sadistic treatment, \n28 \n-7 4- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE REUEF \n\n1  and the wanton and needless infliction of pain, as guaranteed to Plaintiffs by the \n2  Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n3  B.  Fourteenth Amendment To The United States Constitution; 42 \n4  U.S.c. Section 1983 \n5  251.  By reason of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 - 248, \n6  supra, plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin, and the class they represent, were deprived, \n7  and continue to be deprived, by Defendants of their right to due process and to be \n8  free from punishment without process, in the form of gratuitous and excessive \n9  force, threats of gratuitous and excessive force, and degrading, cruel and sadistic \n10  treatment, as guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n11  Constitution. \n12  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs request this Court as follows: \n14  l.  Declare that the continuing inaction of the supervisory defendants, as \n15  described  above,  violates  the  rights  of the  Plaintiff class  under  the  Eighth  and \n16  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n17  2.  Grant  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief,  enJommg \n18  Defendants, their successors, agents,  servants, employees, and all  those in active \n19  concert or participation with them, from subjecting inmates in the Jails to physical \n20  abuse and the threat of physical abuse; \n21  3.  Require these Defendants to formulate a remedy, subject to the court's \n22  approval and modification, if necessary, to end the pattern of excessive force and \n23  physical abuse in those j ails, including: \n24  (A)  adequate policy on the use offorce; \n25  (B)  adequate investigation of all use of force incidents and inmate-\n26  on-inmate violence, with investigations performed by personnel unconnected to the \n27  attack under investigation; \n28 \n-75- COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n1  (C)  appropriate training in use of force and prevention of inmate-on-\n2  inmate violence; \n3  (D)  appropriate discipline of staff members found to be involved in \n4  improper use  of force  incidents,  improper  threats  of violence  against  inmates; \n5  incitement of inmate-on-inmate attacks; or failure to report use offorce incidents; \n6  (E) appropriate selection and supervision of co=and and unifonned \n7  custodial staff. \n8  4.  Retain jurisdiction in this case until the unlawful conditions, practices, \n9  policies, acts, and omissions complained of herein no longer exist and this Court is \n10  satisfied that they will not recur; \n11  5.  Award the costs of this  action, including reasonable  attorneys'  fees; \n12  and \n13  \\\\\\ \n14  \\\\\\ \n15  \\\\\\ \n16  \\\\\\ \n17  \\\\\\ \n18  \\\\\\ \n19  \\\\\\ \n20  \\ \\\\ \n21  \\\\\\ \n22  \\\\\\ \n23  \\\\\\ \n24  \\\\\\ \n25  \\\\\\ \n26  \\\\\\ \n27  \\\\\\ \n28  \\\\\\ \n-76- COMPLAINT FOR lNJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\n6.

This \n6 Report takes into consideration the comments from the parties in accordance with \n7 Section V of the Settlement Agreement.

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the “Rosas” case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the “Panel”) will “prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n[developed by the Panel] (‘Reports’) at intervals the Panel shall determine.”  This Report sets \nforth the Panel’s assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the “Ninth \nReporting Period”), and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas case.  In \naccordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement, it takes into consideration comments \nreceived from County Counsel on June 17, 2021, and from Class Counsel on June 22, 2021, \nregarding the draft of the report that was sent to them on June 1, 2021.     \n   \n  In May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel “to develop a corrective action plan (‘Action \nPlan’) designed to ensure that [inmates] are not subject to excessive force in the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles” (the “Downtown Jail Complex”).  The plan developed by the Panel sets \nforth provisions in twenty-one areas that the Sheriff is required to implement in the Downtown \nJail Complex.  The plan was approved by the Court on April 7, 2016.  Under Paragraph VIII of \nthe Settlement Agreement, “[w]hen the Panel certifies that any recommendation of the Action \nPlan has been implemented, it shall commence a period of monitoring the Defendant’s \ncompliance with respect to that recommendation (‘Compliance Period’).”   As of November 1, \n2018, the Sheriff’s Department (the “Department”) has implemented 104 of the Panel’s 106 \nrecommendations.  The remaining two recommendations, Section 4.10 (expansion of conflict \nresolution training) and Section 9.1 (security checks), have been superseded by the Settlement \nAgreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in United States v. County of Los Angeles, et al., \nCV No. 15-05903 (JEMx) (the “DOJ case”).1   \n \n  In the Panel’s Eighth Report, we noted the continuing reduction in the number of force \nincidents during the first six months of 2020 in the Downtown Jail Complex, with an average of \n76 force incidents per month in these facilities in the first half of the year.2  These totals \ncompared favorably with the latter half of 2019, which saw an average of 107 force incidents per \nmonth, and with 2018, when the monthly average was 130.  We also noted that this positive \ntrend applied to Category 2 force incidents3 in the first half of 2020.  According to data provided \nby the Department, the number of Category 2 incidents fell from 25 per month in 2019 to 13 in \nthe first six months of 2020.  The decreases in Category 2 incidents were seen at all three of the \n \n1 The other recommendations in the Rosas Action Plan have been implemented in the \nother jail facilities outside of the Downtown Jail Complex pursuant to Paragraph 81 of \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the DOJ case. \n2 Since the publication of our Eighth Report, the Department has revised its data slightly \nfor the first half of 2020.  The current data reflects 441 total force incidents in the Downtown \njails during the first half of 2020, representing 73.5 incidents per month. \n3 Category 2 force encompasses most incidents with an “identifiable injury,” including \nrelatively minor injuries such as a cut or a bruise.  Force that is likely to, or does, result in severe \ninjuries is classified as a Category 3 incident.  Category 3 incidents have been relatively rare. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 4 of 30   Page ID #:4331\n \nDowntown jail facilities.  We noted in our Eighth Report that much of this decrease was \nundoubtedly attributable to the significant reduction in the inmate population in the Second \nQuarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n  In the second half of 2020, the use of force numbers increased slightly across all of the \nDowntown facilities, but are still well below the numbers we saw in 2018 and 2019.  According \nto the Department’s statistics, there were 516 uses of force across all three facilities, a 17% \nincrease from the first half of the year.  Most of this increase was due to increases in the number \nof Category 1 incidents at TTCF and MCJ.4  Category 2 incidents increased by 5% across the \nthree facilities.5  Notably, there were no Category 3 force incidents at any of the Downtown jail \nfacilities in the second half of 2020.6 \n \n  While the overall force numbers continue to trend downward, instances of problematic \nuses of force continue to occur in the Downtown jail facilities.  During the Ninth Reporting \nPeriod, the Panel reviewed 53 completed force packages that were selected by the Panel from a \ncomprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the Department.7  In more than 25% of the \nforce packages reviewed, the Panel found some aspect of the force used during the encounter that \nviolated the force prevention principles of Section 2.2 of the Action Plan.  In cases where some \nforce may be warranted, the Panel continues to see improper head strikes by Department \npersonnel.  Even more troubling, the Panel reviewed a small number of cases in the Fourth \nQuarter of 2020 where it appears force was used as discipline or corporal punishment – a \npractice that had seemed to have all but vanished within the Downtown jail facilities.  The Panel \n \n4 As they have in the past, Plaintiffs raise concerns about the Department’s classification \nof force incidents.  Plaintiffs’ Response, p. 4.  As we noted in our Eighth Report, the Panel has \nseen no evidence of systematic misclassification in the dozens of force incidents we review each \nquarter.  With respect to the single incident identified by Plaintiffs as having been misclassified \nas a Category 2 incident (as opposed to Category 3), we have reviewed the incident and concur \nin the Department’s classification. \n5 At TTCF, there was a 22% decrease in Category 2 incidents (from 31 to 24); at IRC \nthere was a 10% increase (from 21 to 23); and at MCJ there was a 30% increase (from 30 to 39).  \nThe Department has pointed to the sharp increase in state prison inmates housed in the County \njails due to public health precautions as contributing to the rise in force incidents, noting that \nstate prison inmates “currently make up more than 20% of the jail population and increase \ndifficulties and challenges in managing routine challenges, creating opportunities for force \navoidance, and put pressure on traditional living conditions issues that exacerbate tensions \nbetween inmates and staff.” Department Response, p. 1.   \n6 Plaintiffs point to a Category 3 incident the Panel reviewed in the Fourth Quarter of \n2020 as evidence of the lack of reliability of the Department’s overall force statistics.  Plaintiffs’ \nResponse, p. 4.  Although reviewed in the Fourth Quarter, the subject incident took place in \nApril 2020. \n7 The Panel reviewed 25 force packages in the Third Quarter of 2020 and 28 force \npackages in the Fourth Quarter of 2020.  As discussed below at pages 8-9, the Panel did not \nselect these force packages randomly or in proportion to the frequency with which various \ncategories of force occur.  Rather, the Panel selected for review the force incidents most likely to \ninvolve problematic uses of force. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 5 of 30   Page ID #:4332\n \nconsiders these cases to be outliers – the Department has made tremendous progress in \nimproving the culture at the Downtown jail facilities and the overwhelming majority of \ninteractions between Department staff and inmates are handled professionally and \nconscientiously.  Even where we have found fault with the tactics or the level of force used in a \nparticular situation, the Panel has almost never concluded that malicious motives were driving \nthe offending staff member.  We expect the Department to pay particular attention to these uses \nof force that appear motivated by anger or the desire for retribution. \n \n  Other issues raised by the Panel in prior reports persisted in the Ninth Reporting period, \nmost notably, the failure of the Department to mete out discipline in cases where force policies \nare violated, or Department personnel inaccurately describe force incidents in their written \nreports.  Although tremendous strides have been made by the Department in limiting improper \nuses of force and developing a culture that discourages bad practices and emphasizes more \npositive staff-inmate relationships, the Panel believes that further progress in eliminating \nimproper uses of force can only be achieved if deputies who clearly cross the line are disciplined.   \n \n     With regard to the non-force related provisions in the Action Plan, the Department \nsubmitted its Ninth Self-Assessment Status Report (the “Ninth Self-Assessment”) on March 15, \n2021, and augmented its self-assessment (the “Augmented Ninth Self-Assessment”) on April 15, \n2021.  During the Ninth Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed records posted by the Department \nto verify the Department’s self-assessments of its compliance with non-force provisions of the \nAction Plan.  The Panel’s evaluation of the provisions of the self-assessment reports are included \nin this Report.  All of the Department’s training results are subject to verification by auditors \nretained by the Panel.  \n \nDue to the restrictions and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Panel \nwas not able to visit the jails in the second half of 2020.  Accordingly, the Panel is not able to \noffer an assessment of the state of the relationship between Department personnel and inmates \nbeyond what can be gleaned from the data and our review of the selected force packages.  We \nhope to resume visits to the jails in the latter half of 2021. \n \n  The Department continued to cooperate fully with the Panel during the Ninth Reporting \nPeriod.  The Department and County Counsel answered our questions and responded to our \nrequests for documents and information.  They also engaged in constructive conversations with \nthe Panel about our findings regarding the use of force incidents we reviewed and the \nDepartment’s continuing efforts to implement the terms of the Rosas Action Plan.  We \nappreciate their responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, and courtesy in handling our \nmonitoring requests.        \n \n   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 6 of 30   Page ID #:4333\n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  A.  Leadership and Accountability \n \n  The recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that Custody \nbe headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the Sheriff be engaged \npersonally in the management of the jails, the Department’s managers be held accountable for \nany failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly report to the \nBoard of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and on its compliance with the Action Plan.    \n \n  The Department has been in Compliance with Sections 1.1 of the Action Plan since well \nbefore January 1, 2017.8  Custody has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of \nresponsibility since mid-2014.  It was under the direction of Assistant Sheriff Bruce Chase \nduring the Ninth Reporting Period.  The Panel found Assistant Sheriff Chase to be accessible, \nforthright and fully supportive of the work of the Panel.9 \n \n  The Panel met with Sheriff Villanueva by video conference in November 2020, and again \nin April 2021. The Department has provided the Panel with a log of the frequent meetings that \nSheriff Villanueva had with Assistant Sheriff Chase from July 2, 2020, through December 31, \n2020, to review use of force incidents, the use of less lethal weapons and personal weapons, cell \nextractions, Category 3 incidents and associated injuries, use of force against mentally ill \ninmates, dorm disturbances, gassing incidents, deployment of chemical agents, de-escalation of \nforce, suicide attempts and rescue force, inmates entering the facilities under the influence and \navailable detox housing units, facility security concerns, assaults on staff, and alternative tactical \napproaches to address current inmate populations.  The Panel is satisfied that the Sheriff is \npersonally engaged in the management of the Department’s Custody operations and the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 1.2 of the Action Plan. \n \nSection 1.3 of the Action Plan provides that Department managers should be held \naccountable should they fail to address use of force problems at the Downtown jail facilities.  \nThe Compliance Measures require the Department to provide a quarterly report that sets forth the \nnumber and rank of personnel found to have violated its use of force policies in the jails.  In the \n \n8 Use of the term Compliance in bold is a finding of compliance as of a certain date.  The \nPanel’s findings are set forth on the Appendix attached hereto.  For other provisions, the \nDepartment has either not achieved compliance or is no longer in compliance during this current \nreporting period.  Based upon the Panel’s findings, the Parties will determine whether the \nSettlement Agreement is subject to termination pursuant to Section VIII of the agreement.  As \nnoted in the Panel’s prior reports, the Panel encourages the “Parties to adopt a meaningful and \nachievable framework to determine the Department’s compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement” in the future.    \n9 The Panel was recently advised that Assistant Sheriff Chase has been re-assigned within \nthe Department and will be replaced by Assistant Sheriff Brendan Corbett, who was previously a \nChief in the Custody Division and prior to that was a Captain in the Division as well.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 7 of 30   Page ID #:4334\n \nThird Quarter of 2020, the Department reports two dispositions for founded violations of the \nDepartment’s use of force policies at IRC, one of which resulted in a 20-day suspension and the \nother a written reprimand.  There were no founded dispositions at TTCF or MCJ in the Third \nQuarter of 2020.  In the Fourth Quarter of 2020, there were nine founded dispositions for \nviolation of the Department’s use of force policies at MCJ.  Six of the involved employees \nreceived written reprimands, two received brief suspensions, and one deputy resigned.  There \nwere no founded dispositions at TTCF or IRC in the Fourth Quarter of 2020.   \n \nCompliance Measures for Section 1.3 also require the Department to provide data \nregarding overall force incidents and Category 3 incidents so the Panel can assess whether there \nhave been substantial increases and whether any such increases have been appropriately \naddressed by Unit Commanders and Commanders.  For the Third Quarter of 2020, each of the \nDowntown jail facilities experienced an increase in the total use of force incidents compared to \nthe low totals from the Second Quarter of 2020.  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, there \nwas a 42% increase in overall force incidents at IRC,10 a 19% increase at MCJ, and a 13% \nincrease at TTCF in the Third Quarter of 2020.  There were no Category 3 incidents at any of the \nDowntown jail facilities in the Third Quarter of 2020.  The Panel finds the Department in \ncompliance with this aspect of Section 1.3 of the Action Plan at all of the Downtown jail \nfacilities in the Third Quarter of 2020.  \n \n  For the Fourth Quarter of 2020, all three Downtown jail facilities experienced continued \nincreases in the number of force incidents.  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, there was \na 52% increase in force incidents at TTCF,11 a 23% increase at IRC, and a 6% increase at MCJ in \nthe Fourth Quarter of 2020.12  The Department’s posted Self-Assessment reveals no Category 3 \nincidents in the Fourth Quarter of 2020.   The Panel finds the Department in compliance with this \naspect of Section 1.3 of the Action Plan at all of the Downtown Jail facilities in the Fourth \nQuarter of 2020.   \n \nThe Department’s Self-Assessment report concludes that the Department was out of \ncompliance with Section 1.3 for the Fourth Quarter based on a discovered failure of TTCF to \ninvestigate an inmate grievance from June 2019 alleging force was used as retaliation.  Although \na subsequent investigation determined that the inmate’s claims were unfounded and Department \npersonnel acted appropriately, the Department correctly notes that the delay in processing this \n \n10 The Department attributes this increase to a 129% increase in the census at IRC and a \ndoubling of the average processing time of inmates coming through IRC due to the need to test \nfor COVID and the state prison moratorium on accepting newly remanded inmates.  \n11 The Department attributes the increase at TTCF to an increase in court activity and an \nincrease in the average daily inmate population. \n12 As noted above and in our Eighth Report, the substantial reduction in force incidents \nduring most of 2020 was likely related to the reduction in the jail population due to safety \nprecautions related to the pandemic.  In the Fourth Quarter of 2020, the inmate population in the \nDowntown Jails increased due to the large number of state prison inmates who remained in the \nCounty jails due to the state prison moratorium noted above. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 8 of 30   Page ID #:4335\n \nincident prevented a proper evaluation of the incident.  Nevertheless, the Panel does not believe \nthat a finding of non-compliance with Section 1.3 based on this incident is appropriate.13 \n \nWhile the Panel does not believe that a finding of non-compliance with Section 1.3 is \nappropriate based on a single failure to investigate promptly an inmate grievance (particularly \nwhere the grievance turns out to be wholly unfounded), we concur in the ultimate conclusion \nreached by the Department regarding non-compliance with Section 1.3.  The basis for our \ndetermination is the Department’s persistent reluctance to impose discipline in those cases where \nuse of force policies are violated.  The Panel continues to see cases involving violations of \npolicy, such as head punches for inmate control, that result in Departmental actions that do not \nreflect the seriousness of the offense.  The Panel has highlighted this shortcoming in prior reports \n(see Eighth Report, p. 5) but has not seen any meaningful change in the extent to which \nDepartment staff (and managers) are held accountable for violation of force policies.  The Panel \nis also concerned that in cases where the Panel has found a policy violation regarding use of \nforce, and where the supervisors or mid-managers reviewing the incident have failed to identify a \npolicy violation or even question the use of force, no action is ever taken against the supervisor \nand/or mid-manager.  Accordingly, the Panel finds the Department out of compliance with \nSection 1.3 of the Action Plan. \n \n  The Department was in Compliance with Section 1.4 in the Ninth Reporting Period.  On \nNovember 10, 2020, Assistant Sheriff Chase, a Commander in Custody Operations and the Unit \nCommander responsible for CCSB made a presentation to the Board of Supervisors on the \nDepartment’s compliance with the Rosas Action Plan.     \n \n  B.  Management Visits \n \n  Sections 10.1 and 10.2 require the Department’s leadership to tour each of the jail \nfacilities and document those visits.  The Department has previously asked the Panel to consider \nsuspending the requirements of these provisions during the pendency of the COVID-19 \nrestrictions.  The Panel did not record a finding for these provisions for the Second Quarter of \n2020, and will not report a finding for the Ninth Reporting Period due to the inability of the \nDepartment to safely conduct the required visits.  Beginning in the First Quarter of 2021, the \nPanel intends to assess compliance with these provisions, and will work with the Parties to \ndevelop technology-based alternatives to in-person visits if current pandemic conditions \npersist.14     \n \n  C.  Rotations and Transfers \n \n  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require the Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotation \npolicies and rotate personnel as required by the policies, and (2) audit each unit’s compliance \n \n13 The failure to investigate and track the allegation of force may constitute a violation of \nSections 5.1, 6.13, and/or 8.3. \n14 The Department reports in its Ninth Self-Assessment that, in February 2021, the \nDepartment adopted protocols to allow executives to “virtually visit” jails and provide feedback \nto staff regarding their observations while COVID-related safety precautions remain in place. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 9 of 30   Page ID #:4336\n \nwith its rotation policies.  The Department’s Ninth Augmented Self-Assessment reports that it \nachieved 99% Compliance in the Ninth Reporting Period.  Each of the Downtown jail facilities \nhas a reasonably current Unit Order setting forth its rotation policy and the source documents \nindicate that most Department personnel are rotated in Compliance with those policies.  The \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 18.1 and Section 18.2 through December 31, 2020.  \n   \n  The Department’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that it maintained 100% Compliance \nwith Section 21.1 as of July 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.  The Panel has reviewed the \nDepartment’s source documents stating the reasons for Deputy transfers to Custody during the \nNinth Reporting Period, which reflect that no member was transferred or assigned to Custody as \na sanction for problematic conduct.   \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 of the Action Plan requires the Department to “have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]” On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.  The Department’s Custody Force Manual satisfies Section 2.1 and includes specific \nprovisions that satisfy Sections 8.2 (Complaints of Retaliation), 17.2 (Pregnant Inmates), 20.1 \n(Types of Force), and 20.2 (Definition of Reactive Force) of the Action Plan.  The Department \nhas been in Compliance with these Sections since the Panel began monitoring the Department’s \ncompliance as of January 1, 2017. \n \n  The other recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department’s use of \nforce in Custody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Sections 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate’s medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Section 20.3 requires the Department to adopt use of force policies for Planned Force \n(such as cell extractions). \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 10 of 30   Page ID\n#:4337\n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department’s policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  \n \n  During the Eighth Reporting Period, the Department advised the Panel of several \nproposed changes to the policies that were previously approved by the Panel.  The Panel was \ngiven the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes.  Although most of the proposed \nchanges were acceptable, the Panel has advised the Department that some modifications are \nnecessary and recommended other modifications to existing policy.  During the Ninth Reporting \nperiod, the Panel continued to work with the Department with respect to proposed revisions to \nthe force policies, including revising the provision regarding prohibited uses of force.  The \nDepartment has been receptive and responsive to comments and suggestions raised by the Panel. \n        \nA.  Review of Force Incidents \n \n  The Action Plan requires that the Panel review selected force packages each quarter to \nassess whether the use of force was in compliance with Sections 2.2 through 2.13, 4.1 through \n4.5, 9.2, 9.3, and 17.5 (the “Force Provisions”) of the Action Plan.  As has been the practice of \nthe Panel, we reviewed the problematic incidents identified during our review with Custody \nCommanders, and took into consideration their comments in reaching the conclusions set forth in \nthis Report.  The Panel also met with Plaintiffs’ counsel to review the force incidents identified \nas problematic by the Panel, as well as additional incidents Plaintiffs’ counsel considered \nproblematic.15  The input of the Department and Plaintiffs’ counsel was extremely helpful in \nreviewing and assessing compliance with the Force Provisions. \n \nThe Department continues to struggle to complete its use of force investigations in a \ntimely manner but has worked diligently in the Ninth Reporting Period to complete the force \npackages requested by the Panel.  We are hopeful that with the filling of many of the Sergeant \nvacancies in Custody Division in early 2021 the pace of the Department’s use of force \ninvestigations will improve, and the Panel will be better able to assess progress in something \napproaching real time.  The Panel’s review of force cases with the Custody Division managers is \nmost effective when the cases are as recent as possible. If the Panel is reviewing cases that are \nmore than a year old, the value of the discussion between the Panel and the Department \nnecessarily decreases. \n \n1.  Third Quarter 2020 results \n \nPer the applicable Compliance Measures, the Panel selected 28 force incidents to review \nin the Third Quarter of 2020 and received and reviewed 25 of those force packages.  The \npackages were selected without input from the Department.  As has been the Panel’s approach in \n \n15 Plaintiffs have complained they are not able to determine the Department’s compliance \nwith various provisions of the Action Plan because of redactions by the Department to \ndocuments provided, as well as incomplete production of video records.  As we have noted in the \npast in response to identical complaints (see Seventh Report, n.3), these are issues for Plaintiffs \nto resolve with the Department and, if necessary, the Court. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 11 of 30   Page ID\n#:4338\n \npast reporting periods, the Panel selected for review the force incidents most likely to involve \nproblematic uses of force:  The Panel asked to review all Category 3 incidents16 (those involving \nforce that is likely to, or does, result in severe injuries) and most Category 2 incidents that \ninvolved strikes or kicks by Department personnel.  Thus, the universe of force incidents selected \nby the Panel included a disproportionate number of the more serious incidents involving the use \nof force by Department personnel.17    \n \nBased on the assessment of each provision across all of the force packages, the Panel \nconcluded that in the Third Quarter of 2020 the Department was not in Compliance with the \nfollowing provisions of the Action Plan applicable to the use of force by its members:  Force \nprevention principles (Section 2.2), head strikes or kicking inmates (Section 2.6), and calling \nsupervisors to the scene before engaging with recalcitrant inmates (Section 2.7).   The Panel \nfound that the Department was in Compliance in the Third Quarter of 2020 with the remaining \nForce Provisions of the Action Plan. \n \n  As in the past, the Panel’s main concern was that Department members sometimes \nreacted too quickly and should have taken advantage of “time and distance” to de-escalate the \nsituation and avoid using force altogether or to plan a potentially safer use of force.  The failure \nto call a supervisor when confronted with a recalcitrant inmate is a corollary of the need for \nDepartment members to take more time before using force to control a recalcitrant inmate.  \nNotwithstanding the Department’s continued acknowledgement that these issues must be \naddressed in its ongoing use of force refresher training, we continue to see instances of force that \ncould have been mitigated by taking advantage of time and distance and calling a supervisor to \nhelp de-escalate the incident. We also see cases where an inmate may not be recalcitrant but \nwhere a Deputy unnecessarily puts hands on an inmate, the inmate reacts to that, and a use of \nforce ensues.  \n \n  Although there were fewer cases in the Third Quarter of 2020 involving improper head \nstrikes this continues to be an issue for the Department.18  In many of the cases, the use of force \nwas justifiable under the circumstances, but the danger presented by the inmate (if any) did not \n \n16 The Panel asked to review both Category 3 incidents from 2020 that had not previously \nbeen requested.  One of those force packages was produced by the Department and reviewed \namong the incidents reviewed for the Fourth Quarter of 2020.  The Panel has been advised that \nthe remaining Category 3 force packages from 2020 are still being reviewed by the Internal \nAffairs Bureau. \n17 According to Use of Force statistics provided by the Department for the Ninth \nReporting Period, 83% of the force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex were either \nCategory 1 incidents or non-categorical incidents, and 17 % were Category 2 incidents.  There \nwere no Category 3 incidents.   \n18  The Panel has recommended in prior reports that head strikes be removed from the \n“Personal Weapon” Category in the Department’s Use of Force policies.  Punches to the head \nshould instead become its own category of “Head Strikes,” and Deputies should be required to \nexplain specifically why a head strike was necessary or occurred.  Policy, training, force \npackages, and supervisor reviews should reflect this change.  The Department has not yet \nresponded to this request. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 12 of 30   Page ID\n#:4339\n \njustify a head strike.  Head strikes should be reserved for situations where the inmate is “high \nrisk/assaultive.”  Yet, too often, head strikes are used as a control mechanism to subdue an \naggressive inmate.  Medical science informs us that some head blows are the ‘hidden injuries’ \nthat create or exacerbate mental illness.  Agencies nationwide have long moved away from \nacceptance of head strikes.  We encourage the Department to pay particular attention to this issue \nmoving forward.  \n \n2.  Fourth Quarter 2020 results \n \nIn the Fourth Quarter of 2020, the Panel reviewed 28 force incidents.  The Panel \nconcluded that the Department was not in compliance with the following provisions of the \nAction Plan applicable to the use of force by its members in the Fourth Quarter of 2020:  Force \nprevention principles (Section 2.2), force used as discipline (Section 2.4), head strikes or kicking \ninmates (Section 2.6), and calling supervisors to the scene before engaging with recalcitrant \ninmates (Section 2.7).  The Panel found that the Department was in Compliance in the Fourth \nQuarter of 2020 with the remaining Force Provisions of the Action Plan. \n \nThe Panel identified several cases during the Fourth Quarter where the use of force \nappeared motivated by a desire to punish the inmate for resistive or assaultive conduct.19  For \nexample, in one incident several deputies struggled to control a handcuffed inmate who resisted \nbeing placed in a suicide gown and then became assaultive when deputies tried to apply the \nWRAP device.  Although the inmate was handcuffed, he was able to grab and twist the fingers of \none deputy and forcefully grab the thigh of another deputy.  Several deputies used permissible \nforce to stop the assaults by the inmate and gain compliance.  The inmate then grabbed the \ngenitals of a deputy who was kneeling behind him to assist in applying the WRAP device.  In \nresponse to this violent assault, the deputy punched the inmate several times in the face, with at \nleast one of the blows coming after the deputy appeared to be free from the inmate’s grasp.  \nAnother deputy intervened to stop the punches by his colleague.  While much of the force used \nin this incident was justified by the inmate’s resistive and assaultive conduct, and the punches at \nissue were an immediate response to a serious assault by the inmate, the Panel concluded that the \nmost aggressive and violent punches were motivated by a desire for retribution against the \nassaultive inmate.  As noted above, this conduct, while aberrational, is particularly troubling to \nthe Panel.  \n \n  The Panel reviewed several cell extractions in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020 to \nassess the Department’s compliance with specific provisions that are applicable to the use of \nforce in those circumstances.  The Panel concluded that, in the Fourth Quarter of 2020, the \nDepartment was not in compliance with Section 4.1 of the Action Plan, related to having a \nmental health professional on-scene to attempt to resolve the situation. \n \n \n19 It is important to note that the cases of concern to the Panel all involved immediate \nreactions of Department members to assaultive conduct by inmates.  These were not cases where \na Department member sought out an inmate for retribution or punishment after a “cooling off” \nperiod. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 13 of 30   Page ID\n#:4340\n \n  Plaintiffs have identified several concerns this reporting period related to the force used \nby Department personnel in applying the WRAP device to inmates following force incidents.  As \nnoted below in the discussion regarding the restraint provisions of the Action Plan, the Panel \nworked with the Department in developing the policy related to the use of the WRAP device and \nintends to meet with the Department to discuss the implementation of that policy and the \nconcerns raised by Plaintiffs regarding the force used in relation to the application of the device.  \nTo date, we have not found the Department out of compliance with any provision of the Action \nPlan based on its use of the WRAP device. \n \nPlaintiffs identify three cases in which force was used against restrained inmates (two of \nwhich involved the application of the WRAP device) and urge a finding of non-compliance with \nrespect to Section 2.5.  While the Panel did identify a small number of cases in this reporting \nperiod where strikes or tasers were used on restrained inmates,20 the Panel determined, based on \na qualitative assessment of the totality of cases reviewed during the reporting period, that the \nDepartment was in compliance with Section 2.5.     \n \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining on use of force policies and on ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with \nrespect; and that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody-specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and in “identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.”  Section 12.1 requires that Custody Sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.    \n \n  The Department’s training results are subject to audit by the Panel’s auditors.  All of the \nDepartment’s reported results for the initial training of existing Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants and for new members set forth below have been verified by the Panel’s auditors based \nupon reviews of Department rosters and training records.  The auditors verified that the \nDepartment’s new members had received the required initial training from when it was first \noffered through the “as of” date reported by the Department for the completion of the initial \ntraining required for existing Deputies and Custody Assistants.  Accordingly, the Panel has \npreviously deemed the Department to be in compliance “as of” the date reported by the \nDepartment for the completion of the initial training required for existing personnel.  The \nDepartment’s continuing compliance with the training provisions is determined by its \ncompliance with the refresher training required every year or every other year.  \n \n \n \n \n \n20 The Panel disagrees with Plaintiffs’ contention that pressure applied to a restrained \ninmate implicates Section 2.5, which refers to strikes or the use of chemical agents or a Taser on \na restrained inmate. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 14 of 30   Page ID\n#:4341\n \n  A.  Use of Force Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, the Department was found to be in compliance with the training \nrequirements of Section 3.1.21  In the Eighth Reporting Period, the Department reported that \ncertain training classes were cancelled or modified due to COVID-19 safety restrictions and \nrequested that the Panel defer an assessment of this provision until the Ninth Reporting Period.  \nIn its Augmented Ninth Self-Assessment Report, the Department notes an inability to conduct \nthe required Section 3.1 training due to the state’s suspension of training courses in June 2020 \nand requests a six-month extension to train personnel and meet compliance with Section 3.1 \nbased on the course approved by the state in April 2021.  The Panel will maintain the \nCompliance assessment from the Seventh Reporting Period pending the year-end refresher \ntraining results for 2020.  The final 2020 results will be subject to verification by the Panel’s \nauditors.   \n \n  B.  Ethics and Professionalism Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 95% of the existing personnel received the initial four-hour training \ncourse in ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with respect as required by Section 3.2.  \n95% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required refresher \ncourse through December 31, 2018.  In its Augmented Ninth Self-Assessment Report, the \nDepartment notes an inability to conduct the required Section 3.2 training due to limited class \nsizes as a result of pandemic safety restrictions and budget cuts that have pulled instructors away \nfrom training activities to assist in custody facilities.  The Department has requested a six-month \nextension to conduct the 2020 assessment.  The Panel will maintain the Compliance assessment \nfrom the Seventh Reporting Period pending the year-end refresher training results for 2020.  The \nfinal 2020 results will be subject to verification by the Panel’s auditors. \n \n  C.  Mental Health Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies at the Downtown Jail Complex and in \nthe mental health unit at the Century Regional Detention Facility (“CRDF”) received the 32 \nhours of training on Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution Training (DeVRT), including the \neight hours of identifying and working with mentally ill inmates, required by Sections 4.6 and \n4.7.  Also as of that date, 98% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF, and all Deputies at the North \nCounty Correctional Facility (“NCCF”), and the Pitchess Detention Center (“PDC”) jails \nreceived the eight hours training in identifying and working with mentally ill inmates required by \nSection 4.7.   \n \n  The Seventh Self-Assessment reported that for 2019, 98% of the Deputy Sheriffs and \nCustody Assistants received the required refresher training22 for Section 4.6 and 96% of the \nDeputies received the required four hours of refresher training for Section 4.7.  The refresher \n \n21 The use of force training approved by the Panel includes the custody-based use of force \nscenarios, constituting Compliance with Section 3.4.  \n22 Eight hours every other year for Section 4.6 and four hours every other year for Section \n4.7. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 15 of 30   Page ID\n#:4342\n \nresults were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department was found to be in Compliance \nwith Section 4.6 and 4.7 as of December 31, 2019.  In its Augmented Ninth Self-Assessment \nReport, the Department notes an inability to conduct the required Section 4.6 and Section 4.7 \ntraining due to limited class sizes as a result of pandemic safety restrictions and budget cuts that \nhave pulled instructors away from training activities to assist in custody facilities.  The \nDepartment has requested a six-month extension to conduct the 2020 assessment.  The Panel will \nmaintain the Compliance assessment from the Seventh Reporting Period pending the year-end \nrefresher training results for 2020.  The final 2020 results will be subject to verification by the \nPanel’s auditors. \n \n  D.  New Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants \n \n  The Department has reported since the First Reporting Period that, beginning on July 1, \n2015, newly assigned Deputies have been required to complete a six-week Custody Operations \ncourse that includes training in use of force and ethics, professionalism and treating inmates with \nrespect, and new Custody Assistants have received training in these subjects during their \nAcademy training as required by Section 3.3.  The Department’s posted audit results reflect that \nthe Department has exceeded the 95% Compliance standard for new Deputies and new Custody \nAssistants for the Third Quarter of 2020.  These results have been verified by the Panel’s \nauditors and the Department is in Compliance with Section 3.3 through September 30, 2020.  In \nits Augmented Ninth Self-Assessment Report, the Department notes an inability to conduct the \nrequired Section 3.3 training for the Fourth Quarter of 2020 due to limited class sizes as a result \nof pandemic safety restrictions and budget cuts that have pulled instructors away from training \nactivities to assist in custody facilities.  The Department has requested a six-month extension to \nconduct the 2020 assessment. The Panel notes that the six weeks of Custody Operations training \nis fundamental and imperative for both new Deputies and new Custody Assistants and does not \nconcur with the decision to reassign the necessary trainers.  Thus, the Panel finds the Department \nin non-compliance with Section 3.3 for the Fourth Quarter of 2020. \n \n  The Department previously reported that 100% of new Deputies and Custody Assistants \nhad received the conflict resolution training (DeVRT) and training in “identifying and working \nwith mentally ill inmates” (“IIMI”) required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 in the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2019.  These results were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department was \nfound to be in Compliance with Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June 30, 2018 through December 31, \n2019.  The required DeVRT and IIMI training takes place after Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistant Academy graduations and prior to assuming duties at their unit of assignment.  The \nDepartment’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the new Deputies received the \nrequired training in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  The results for the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2020 have been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  The Department is in Compliance \nwith Sections 4.8 and 4.9 through December 31, 2020. \n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine “what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it ‘Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better;’ direct that the \nDepartment member undergo such additional training, counseling, or mentoring; and document \nthe action taken.”  The Department’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that there were no inmate \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 16 of 30   Page ID\n#:4343\n \ngrievances against staff involving use of force where the disposition was that it “Appears \nEmployee Conduct Could Have Been Better.”  The Department is in Compliance with Section \n3.5 as of December 31, 2020.   \n   \n  Section 3.6 requires Unit Commanders to review new Department members within six \nmonths of being initially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary \nperiod.  Based upon a random selection of personnel records, the Department reports that 78% of \nthe new Department members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6 in the last six months of \n2020, which is substantially below the 95% threshold for Compliance.  These results are \nconsistent with the lackluster results from earlier reporting periods, and suggest that the \nCorrective Action Plan and other measures implemented by the Department following prior non-\ncompliant quarters were not successful in ensuring compliance.  The Department reports in its \nNinth Self-Assessment Report that further briefings have been conducted to explain to Unit \nCommanders at each facility the importance of timely reviews.    \n \n  E.  Sergeant Training \n \n  Section 12.1 requires that all Custody Sergeants receive an initial 16-hour block of \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.  The Panel approved the 16-hour initial \ntraining course on February 24, 2017.  During the Fourth Quarter of 2016, the Department did \nnot reach compliance due to nine sergeants failing to receive the approved training within 90 \ndays after the course was approved; however, the Department has since demonstrated to the \nPanel that by the Third Quarter of 2019 virtually all of the Sergeants who initially missed the \nrequired training have completed their training.  These results have been confirmed by the \nauditors.  Since the Fourth Quarter of 2019, 100% of the Sergeants newly promoted in Custody \nreceived the required training.  These results have been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  \nAccordingly, the Panel finds the Department in Compliance with Section 12.1 as of the Third \nQuarter of 2019.23  The Department reports that there were no newly promoted Sergeants in the \nThird and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  The Department’s Augmented Ninth Self-Assessment \nreports that 97% of the Sergeants who were required to receive refresher training received the \nrequired refresher training in 2020.  The results for 2020 have been verified by the Panel’s \nauditors.        \n \n4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  Many of the recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are assessed by the \nPanel through a review of the completed force packages.  Other provisions are reported by the \nDepartment as follows:    \n \n  Section 5.1 requires the Department to track use of force investigations, reviews, and \nevaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of \ndiscrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The Department reports that 100% of \nthe force incidents in the Third Quarter of 2020 were timely entered into the database as \n \n23 The Appendix has been revised to reflect the accurate date of compliance. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 17 of 30   Page ID\n#:4344\n \nrequired by Section 5.1, and 96% were timely entered in the Fourth Quarter of 2020, \nwhich is above the 95% threshold required for Compliance.   \n \n  Section 8.3 requires that investigations of grievances claiming that Department members \nused force to retaliate against inmates be timely evaluated by the Custody Force Review \nCommittee (“CFRC”).  The Department reports that it achieved 100% Compliance with \nthis provision in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.24  \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents.  The \nCompliance Measure requires that “95% of the investigations reviewed by CFRT were \nnot delayed beyond the period permitted by law for imposing discipline.”  The \nDepartment previously reported that it achieved Compliance with Section 11.1 in the \nSecond Quarter of 2018.  Because there were no use of force incidents reviewed by \nCFRT in which there was a finding of a policy violation or misconduct in either the Fifth, \nSixth, Seventh, Eighth, or Ninth Reporting Periods, the predicate for determining \ncompliance with Section 11.1 did not exist in those periods and the Department remains \nin Compliance.   \n \n  Section 13.1 requires the Department to “have a firm policy of zero tolerance for acts of \ndishonesty or failure to report uses of force.”  Sections 13.1 and 13.2 require the \ndocumentation of the reasons and reports to the Inspector General whenever the \nDepartment does not terminate a member who has been found to have been dishonest, \nused excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”).  The \nDepartment’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that in the Third Quarter of 2020 one deputy \nwas found to have used excessive force during an incident in 2016, and another deputy \nwas found to have made false statements during an internal investigation.  Neither deputy \nwas terminated – the former was discharged due to an unrelated Internal Affairs \ninvestigation and the latter resigned.  The Inspector General was advised of both matters.  \nDuring the Fourth Quarter of 2020, one deputy was found to have made false statements \nto his supervisor and was placed on a formal performance review program.25  The \nInspector General was advised of the action.  The Department is in Compliance with \nSections 13.1 and 13.2 through December 31, 2020.26  \n \n24 As noted above, the handling of the inmate grievance noted by the Department in its \nself-assessment under Section 1.3 may constitute a violation of Section 8.3.  Nevertheless, the \nPanel concurs in the Department’s finding of overall compliance with Section 8.3. \n25 The Panel notes that the instances of dishonesty identified by the Department in its \nNinth Self-Assessment do not appear to relate to reported uses of force. \n26 The Panel has previously noted its concern that reviewed use of force packages include \nstaff reports that are inaccurate and self-serving, but which are not treated as “dishonesty” or \n“integrity” issues by the Department.  See Seventh Report (p. 18) and Eighth Report (p. 15).  In \nthis Report, the Panel has found the Department out of compliance with Sections 5.2 \n(Commanders’ reviews); 5.3 (unexplained discrepancies); and 15.3 (reports of force by other \nmembers), based in large part on reports that do not accurately describe the use of force or the \ninmate’s conduct that prompted the use of force.  Nevertheless, the Panel has deemed the \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 18 of 30   Page ID\n#:4345\n \n \nPlaintiffs object to the Panel’s finding of compliance with respect to Section 13.1, \nasserting that mere compliance with the Compliance Measures adopted by the Panel (and \nrevised in 2018) does not constitute compliance with this provision of the Action Plan. \n(Plaintiffs’ Response, p. 13).  Plaintiffs’ assessment of this provision relies on the first \nsentence of Section 13.1, which states: “The Department should have a firm policy of \nzero tolerance for acts of dishonesty or failure to report uses of force.”  However, the \nremainder of Section 13.1 suggests that the assessment of this “zero tolerance” policy \nshould be limited to whether the Department acts decisively in those cases where a \nmember has been found to have been dishonest, used excessive force, or violated PREA.  \nThe Compliance Measures adopted by the Panel follow this reading of the provision.  To \nthe extent there is a dispute about the reach of the Section 13.1, the parties should attempt \nto resolve that issue. \n  \n  Sections 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of inmates for \ncriminal prosecution arising from incidents involving the use of force by Department \nmembers and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of “officer misconduct that may \namount to criminal violations.”  The Department reports 100% in Compliance with \nSection 14.1 in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  With respect to Section 14.2, \nthere were four referrals to the District Attorney in the Third Quarter of 2020.  Two of the \nreferrals were within six months of the incident, and one referral was approximately 10 \nmonths after the incident.  The fourth incident, involving alleged workers compensation \nfraud by an employee, was not referred to the District Attorney until almost three years \nafter the incident.   In the Fourth Quarter of 2020, there was one referral to the District \nAttorney, involving MCJ employees alleged to have committed aggravated assault.  The \nmatter was referred two years after the incident.  The Department has not demonstrated \ngood cause for the lengthy delays in referring the aforementioned cases to the District \nAttorney.  Accordingly, the Department is not in compliance with Section 14.2 for the \nThird and Fourth Quarters of 2020.   \n   \n  A.  Third Quarter 2020 Results \n \n  The Panel reviewed 25 completed force packages in the Third Quarter of 2020 to assess \ncompliance with the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the reporting and investigation of \nforce incidents.  The Panel concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the \nfollowing provisions:  Commanders’ reviews (Section 5.2), unexplained discrepancies in reports \n(Section 5.3), location of inmate interviews (Section 12.2), failure to report force by other \nmembers (section 15.3) and separation of involved staff until completion of their reports (15.6).27   \n \nDepartment in compliance with Sections 13.1 and 13.2 based on the Department’s adherence to \nthe Compliance Measures applicable to those provisions.   \n27 As noted in our prior reports, the documentation provided by the Department is not \nsufficient for the Panel to determine the Department’s compliance with Section 15.6.  To achieve \ncompliance with Section 15.6, the supervisor must document that the members were separated \nand how this separation was accomplished. The Department has advised the Panel that it is now \nrequiring that information in the Supervisors’ reports. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 19 of 30   Page ID\n#:4346\n \n \nAs noted above, the Panel remains concerned that inaccurate reporting by Department \nstaff regarding uses of force is not being consistently identified and addressed.  Indeed, in the \nmajority of cases where the Panel has found the use of force to be out of policy there is at least \none report, either by the offending staff member or a witnessing staff member, that does not \naccurately describe the use of force or the inmate’s conduct that prompted the use of force.  The \nPanel recognizes that perceptions and memories will vary in these intense and fast-developing \nsituations, but there have been repeated instances in which staff reports are clearly contradicted \nby video evidence.28  Although supervisors will occasionally note discrepancies in reports or \npossible collaboration among staff in the preparation of the reports, we rarely see a robust \ndiscussion by reviewing commanders of inaccurate characterizations in reports, and never see \ndiscipline imposed for submission of false reports.    \n \nMore generally, while the Watch Commander and Unit Commander reviews are more \nsubstantive and probing than we saw in the early years of our monitoring, we are not consistently \nseeing rigorous reviews across all levels of the Department.  We continue to see improper uses of \nforce validated in the initial Supervisor’s review and one or both Commander reviews often \nconcur in the erroneous evaluation of the reviewing Sergeant.  This is an area where there has \nbeen improvement by the Department, but the Panel expects to see more consistent recognition \nof problematic uses of force at all levels of review.   \n     \n  B.  Fourth Quarter 2020 Results \n \n  The Panel reviewed 28 completed force packages in the Fourth Quarter of 2020.  The \nPanel concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the following provisions:  \nCommanders’ reviews (Section 5.2); unexplained discrepancies in reports (Section 5.3), location \nof inmate interviews (Section 12.2), presence at suspect interview of involved personnel (Section \n12.3), failure to report force by other members (section 15.3), and failure to note injuries (section \n15.4).  In addition, the information provided by the Department was not, in many cases, \nsufficient for the Panel to determine the Department’s compliance with the provision relating to \nthe separation of Department personnel after a force incident (Section 15.6).    \n \nPlaintiffs challenge the Panel’s finding of compliance with respect to Section 15.1, which \nrelates to the timeliness of reports.  The Panel reviews several types of reports prepared by the \nDepartment.  Section 15.1 relates to reports required of members who use or assist in force or \nsupervisors who direct force.  Those individuals are required to submit reports prior to the end of \nshift absent serious injury or other extenuating and documented reason for not doing so.  During \nthis reporting period, there were a very small number of late reports judged by this criterion. \n   \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  The Action Plan requires extensive changes in how the Department handles inmate \ngrievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016, the Department issued a new “Inmate \n \n28 The Panel routinely identifies for the Department instances of such false reporting at \nthe quarterly force review meetings. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 20 of 30   Page ID\n#:4347\n \nGrievance Manual” (Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual) to implement a new grievance \nsystem.  The Panel assessed the Department’s implementation of the new grievance system in \nthe Ninth Reporting Period as follows: \n \n  A.  Grievance Forms \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.6 require that separate forms for inmate grievances be reasonably \navailable to inmates and that the forms have specific check boxes.  Section 7.1 requires the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the \nDepartment’s Conflict Resolution Policy.29  The Panel has previously concluded that the forms \nmeeting the requirements of the Action Plan are reasonably available to inmates, and the \nDepartment remains in Compliance with those provisions relating to the availability of the \nrequired forms in printed or electronic format.   \n \n  One area of continuing concern is the significant backlog in processing grievances filed \nagainst staff, particularly at MCJ.  The Panel raised this issue in its Eighth Report, and has seen \nlittle change in this reporting period.  During the second half of 2020, there were 230 complaints \nagainst staff at MCJ that were received and assigned for review.  Only 25 of those complaints \nhad been resolved by the end of the Fourth Quarter of 2020 – approximately four cases per \nmonth.30  The Department’s data continues to reflect a bottleneck with the reviewing Sergeants \nat MCJ.  The Panel understands that staffing cuts within Custody Operations are contributing to \nthis backlog. The Department has taken steps in the First Quarter of 2021 to increase Sergeant \nstaffing in the Custody division, and expects to improve its processing of grievances in the next \nreporting period.  As we have noted in the past, the appropriate and prompt handling of \ngrievances against staff – perhaps more than any other type of grievance – is critical to \nmaintaining an appropriate culture within the jails and giving credibility to the grievance process.  \nWe look forward to seeing substantial improvement on this issue in the coming months. \n \n  Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of the Action Plan require that use of force and retaliation grievances \nagainst staff are brought to the attention of Unit Commanders and properly handled.  The \napplicable Compliance Measures require that grievances be brought to the Unit Commander within \n10 days of receipt.  Based upon a review of the relevant grievances in the randomly selected \nmonths, the Department reports that 89.5% use of force grievances were in Compliance with \nSection 6.4 in the Third Quarter of 202031 and 100% were in Compliance in the Fourth Quarter of \n2020.   Although the Department fell slightly below the 90% compliance measure threshold in the \nThird Quarter, the Panel finds the Department in Compliance with Section 6.4 for the Third and \n \n29 The Department reports that there were no grievances adjudicated by means of a \nConflict Resolution Meeting in the Third Quarter of 2020 and two Conflict Resolution Meetings \nin the Fourth Quarter of 2020. \n30 Although this is nearly double the number of grievances completed in the first half of \nthe year, the results are still woeful.  \n31 Two of 19 grievances were not provided to a Unit Commander within 10 days of \ncollection; however, the vast majority were processed within 5 days. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 21 of 30   Page ID\n#:4348\n \nFourth Quarters of 2020.32  The Department reports that 96% of the retaliation grievances in the \nThird Quarter and 100% in the Fourth Quarter of 2020 were in Compliance with Section 6.5.  The \nsource documents posted by the Department for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 have been reviewed by the \nPanel, which verified that these grievances were handled appropriately.  \n \n  B.  Emergency Grievances      \n \n  Sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the Action Plan set forth specific requirements for the \ndetermination, handling, and notifications of non-medical emergencies.  Section 6.7 requires: (1) \nDeputies to send any grievance marked “emergency” to a supervisor for review “as soon as \npossible;\" (2) supervisors to determine if “the situation requires immediate action to protect the \nlife or safety of the inmate;” (3) supervisors to notify watch commanders/shift supervisors of any \nnon-medical emergencies; (4) Watch Commanders/shift supervisors to immediately confirm the \nemergencies exist and take action “to protect the inmates;” and (5) Watch Commanders/shift \nsupervisors to notify the inmate in writing about “what action was taken to address the \nemergency.”  The Compliance Measures require that 95% of the grievances marked as \nemergencies “be reviewed and handled as required by [Section] 6.7.”  It is implicit in Section 6.7 \nthat a supervisor’s determination that the situation requires immediate action and a Watch \nCommander’s confirmation that emergencies exist will be reasonable.  Section 6.8 requires that \nif the Department determines that a non-medical emergency does not exist, the Department must \nnotify the inmate that it will be handled as a non-emergency grievance and document why it was \ndetermined not to be an emergency.   \n \nBased upon the review of the grievances marked “emergency” in the month randomly \nselected by the Panel for the Third Quarter of 2020, the Department reports there were 50 \ngrievances that met the criteria of Section 6.7, and in eight instances the inmates were not \nprovided with a written response to the grievance within the required five days.  This \nperformance falls below the threshold for compliance.  The Panel has reviewed each of the 50 \ngrievances produced from the Third Quarter of 2020 in which a grievance marked “emergency” \nwas downgraded.  The Panel identified only two instances where the grievance should have been \ntreated as emergent.      \n \nFor the Fourth Quarter of 2020, the Department reviewed 22 grievances that were \nhandled as emergent and found that in three cases the inmates were not provided with a written \nresponse to the grievance within the required five days.  The Department also reviewed 50 \ngrievances that were marked as “emergency” but handled as non-emergent and found that 100% \nof the grievances were properly downgraded.  The Panel has reviewed the source documents \nrelated to the selected grievances and determined that virtually all of the grievances downgraded \nto non-emergent in the Fourth Quarter of 2020 were appropriately downgraded by the \nDepartment.  Accordingly, the Panel agrees with the Department’s Self-Assessment that it was in \n \n32 The Panel rejects Plaintiffs’ contention that the Department should be found out of \ncompliance with Section 6.4 based on its self-identified failure to meet the 90% threshold of the \nCompliance Measure.  The reviewed documents reveal that the Department has been diligent in \nbringing force grievances to Unit Commanders, sufficient to establish compliance with the \nlanguage of Section 6.4.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 22 of 30   Page ID\n#:4349\n \nCompliance with Section 6.7 in the Fourth Quarter of 2020 and in Compliance with Section 6.8 \nin the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020. \n \n  C.  Inmate Grievance Coordinator \n \n  Section 6.9 requires that emergency grievances be forwarded to the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator.  Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 require the Inmate Grievance Coordinator to track the \nDepartment’s handling of inmate grievances, provide a monthly report to the Unit Commander \nand senior management in Custody on the status of inmate grievances, and analyze inmate \ngrievances for problematic trends.  The Department provided documentation to the Panel \nshowing that for the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020, the Inmate Grievance Coordinator \nreceived the information about emergency grievances required by Section 6.9 and prepared \ndetailed reports for managers as required by Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.  The Department is in \nCompliance with Sections 6.9, 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 through December 31, 2020. \n \n  The Panel met with the Inmate Grievance Coordinator during the Ninth Reporting Period \nto discuss the Department’s implementation of its grievance policies and procedures and overall \ntrends with respect to the Department’s handling of inmate grievances.  As previously reported, \nthe Panel believes that the structure of the grievance system developed by the Department under \nthe direction of an Inmate Grievance Coordinator is effectively and efficiently handling inmate \ngrievances and requests for service and that the Department is in Compliance with Section \n6.16.33 \n \n  D.  Handling of Grievances \n \nSections 6.10 and 6.12 require that grievances be collected daily, logged in, and tracked \nin an inmate grievance database.  The Compliance Measures for these provisions require that the \nDepartment review the first 25 consecutive grievances from MCJ and the first 25 consecutive \ngrievances from TTCF during the randomly selected month to determine if they were collected, \nreviewed and tracked as required.  The Department’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that 100% \nof the reviewed grievances were collected and reviewed within 24 hours and handled as required \nin both the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  The collection logs provided by the Department \nconfirm that all 50 of the grievances selected for review were collected and reviewed as required \nby Section 6.10.34  A review of the Unit Collection data for MCJ and TTCF during the selected \n \n33 Plaintiffs again raise an objection regarding the Panel’s finding with respect to Section \n6.16.  Plaintiffs’ Response, p. 11.  Long ago, the Panel made a determination that the structure of \ngrievance teams at the Downtown Jails proposed by the Department, including the appointment \nof a Grievance Coordinator responsible for supervising the grievance teams at all of the facilities, \nwas equivalent in function to the centralized system specified in the Action Plan and acceptable, \npending progress and specific results.   \n34 As noted in our Eighth Report, the Compliance Measure for Section 6.10 does not \nyield data sufficient to assess compliance with this provision.  For example, the first 25 \nconsecutive grievances at MCJ for the selected months were collected within the first three days \nof the month.  The fact that MCJ timely collected grievances from its collection boxes in those  \nfirst three days does not provide a meaningful measurement of the Department’s compliance \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 23 of 30   Page ID\n#:4350\n \nmonths reveals that MCJ collection compliance exceeded 95% for both quarters, and TTCF \nachieved 92% compliance in the selected month in the Third Quarter and 93% compliance in the \nselected month in the Fourth Quarter.  The Panel finds the Department in Compliance with \nSection 6.10 for the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020. \n \n  The Department’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the grievances at both \nMCJ and TTCF in the randomly selected months in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020 were \nentered into the database as required by Section 6.12.  The source documents for these results \nwere available to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 6.12 through December 31, 2020.  \n \n  Section 6.11 requires that the Custody Division Manual provide that failing to comply \nwith Department policies requiring proper handling of inmate grievances may be cause for \ndiscipline.  The Department reports that there was one claim that Department members failed to \nprovide grievance forms to an inmate upon request.  The Department provided to the Panel the \nrequired log reflecting this claim and the report of the investigation into the inmate’s claim, \nduring which the accused staff were all exonerated.  Accordingly, the Department is in \nCompliance with Section 6.11 through December 31, 2020.    \n \n  Section 8.1 prohibits Department personnel from retaliating against inmates.  The \nDepartment posted the results of the investigations approved by Unit Commanders in the \nrandomly selected months and the number of anti-retaliation grievances received and \ninvestigated in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  It reports that in the Third Quarter of \n2020 there were six grievances alleging retaliation resolved in the selected month, with no \nfindings of a violation of the anti-retaliation policy.  For the entire quarter, there were 59 anti-\nretaliation grievances received, no investigations completed, and no founded violations of the \nanti-retaliation policy.  In the Fourth Quarter of 2020 there were eight grievances alleging \nretaliation resolved in the selected month, with no findings of a violation of the anti-retaliation \npolicy.  For the entire quarter, there were 19 anti-retaliation grievances received, no \ninvestigations completed, and no founded violations of the anti-retaliation policy.  The Panel \nreviewed the investigative summaries that were posted by the Department of the anti-retaliation \ngrievances that Unit Commanders deemed unfounded in the random months of August and \nOctober 2020 and agrees with the Commanders’ assessments.35  The Panel finds that the \nDepartment has maintained Compliance with Section 8.1 through December 31, 2020. \n \n  The Panel has previously noted its disappointment regarding the pace of implementation \nof technology to electronically receive and track the Department’s handling of inmate grievances \nwithin the jails. (See Eighth Report, p. 21).  The plan was to install iPads in tamper-proof cases \nwithin the living units and to automate the grievance process, retaining paper grievance forms for \nthose inmates who preferred them.  Prior to installing grievance software, the iPads in TTCF \n \nwith Section 6.10.  As such, the Panel has reviewed (and will continue to review) the Unit \nCollection compliance data for the entire month to assess compliance with Section 6.10.   \n35 The grievances reviewed by the Panel were resolved by the Department during the \nselected months (August and October) and deemed to be unfounded.  These grievances were all \nreceived and investigated in prior quarters.    \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 24 of 30   Page ID\n#:4351\n \nwere outfitted with inmate request and information software so that questions about an inmate’s \naccount, court dates, medical appointments, and much more could be accessed and answered by \ninmates without staff involvement.  That was a huge success, with hundreds of thousands of \ninmate inquiries answered immediately, which removed a huge workload from frontline staff and \neliminated a great deal of inmate frustration when staff does not have time to get answers to \nthose questions.  The Panel was most optimistic about the Department expanding the program to \nthe other facilities and enhancing them with the grievance system capabilities, but a combination \nof technological challenges, indecision regarding the appropriate operating system and delays \ndue to COVID-19 and other health issues within the jails appears to have set the entire initiative \nback.  The Department reports that it continues to press forward on this initiative.  The Panel \nexpects the Department to re-double its efforts to more widely implement the electronic tablet \nprogram throughout the Downtown Jail Complex. \n \nE.  Deadlines    \n \n  Sections 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, and 6.20 set forth the deadlines for filing use of force and \nPREA grievances,36 the Department’s initial responses, inmates’ right to appeal, and the \nDepartment’s notifications of the results of the investigations.  The Department’s Ninth Self-\nAssessment reports that it adhered to the deadlines for these grievances in both the Third and \nFourth Quarters of 2020.  The Panel has reviewed the source materials provided by the \nDepartment and agrees that the Department is in Compliance with Sections 6.17, 6.18 and 6.20 \nthrough December 31, 2020.37  \n  \nAs previously noted by the Panel, however, the Department reports on the timeliness of \nresponses by Correctional Health Services to inmate grievances against the medical staff (e.g., \nlack of a timely response to a request for medical service), a metric required to achieve \nCompliance with Section 6.19.  The Panel recognizes that Correctional Health Services is under \na separate County agency but has suggested for some time that representatives from the Health \nDepartment participate in the grievance review with Department members and the Panel.  That \nhas not happened, but the health grievance notifications continue to fall substantially below \ncompliance. \n   \n  F.  Communications with Inmates \n \n  The Ninth Self-Assessment also reports that the Department adhered to the deadlines for \nadvising inmates of the results of adjudications as required by Section 7.2 for Third Quarter \n(96%) and the Fourth Quarter (91%) of 2020.  The posted source documents for these results \nwere available to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 7.2 through December 31, 2020.  \n \n36 Section 6.18 provides that there is no deadline for filing PREA grievances.   \n37 Plaintiffs acknowledge that Department policy aligns with the appropriate deadlines set \nforth in these provisions but points out that the grievance form provided to inmates reflects an \ninaccurate (shorter) deadline in certain cases.  The Panel will notify the Department that this \nissue has been identified by Plaintiffs as an error that needs correcting but will not find \nsubstantive non-compliance on Section 6.17 this reporting period. \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 25 of 30   Page ID\n#:4352\n \n   \n  Section 7.3 requires the Department to “ensure that there are adequate avenues for \nconstructive prisoner-staff communication[.]” The Department’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports \nthat the Department was in Compliance with Section 7.3 during both the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2020.  The Department provided logs of Town Hall meetings at MCJ and TTCF \nduring the randomly selected months the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020 that included Town \nHall meetings in special housing units as well as in General Population housing units.  Based on \nthese logs, the Panel is of the view that the Department has achieved Compliance with Section \n7.3 for the period July 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. \n     \n6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include “a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints” identified in this recommendation.  \nThe Department included such a separate section in the Manual, and is in Compliance with this \nrequirement of Section 17.1, effective December 1, 2015. \n   \n  Section 17.3 requires medical examinations of inmates placed in safety chairs and \nSection 17.4 requires safety checks of inmates in fixed restraints every twenty minutes.38  The \nCompliance Measures require the Department to provide the Panel “with a list of incidents in \nwhich inmates were placed in a Safety Chair, restrained to a fixed object for more than 20 \nminutes, subjected to security restraints for an extended length of time” in the Downtown Jail \nComplex.39   \n \n  During the Ninth Reporting Period, the Department provided the Inmate Safety Chair \nSecurity Check Logs for use of the safety chair and Fixed Restraint Logs at Downtown Jail \nComplex in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  With respect to safety chairs, the \nDepartment continues to fail to conduct and/or document the medical checks required by Section \n17.3, and in more than half of the cases in each quarter Department personnel either failed to \ncheck on the inmate every twenty minutes or failed to provide an adequate record of that check \nas required by Section 17.4.  Accordingly, the Panel finds the Department out of compliance \nwith each of those provisions. \n \n  Section 17.10 provides that medication cannot be used solely for security purposes.  The \nDepartment’s posted Self-Assessment, confirmed by a log of the Administration of Involuntary \nMedications, reports that every administration of involuntary medications was pursuant to court \norder and there were no instances in which medication was used solely for security purposes in \n \n38 Many situations that have in prior years involved the use of safety chair, transport \nchairs or gurneys, particularly for transportation of inmates after uses of force, have been \nsupplanted by use of the WRAP device. The Panel has worked with the Department on policy \ngoverning the use of the WRAP device and will work with the Department to develop \nappropriate measures to assess compliance with the Restraint Provisions of the Action Plan \nimpacted by the use of the WRAP device.  \n39 Sections 17.6 through 17.9 govern the application of multi-point restraints, which the \nPanel has been advised by the Department it does not use. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 26 of 30   Page ID\n#:4353\n \nthe Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.  Accordingly, the Department has been in Compliance \nwith Section 17.10 through December 31, 2020.  \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Section 19.1 requires the Department to develop an Early Warning System to identify \npotentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel approved the \nEmployee Review System (“ERS”) in July 2018, and it was implemented by the Department as a \npilot program in the Downtown Jail Complex on August 1, 2018, and in the rest of the jail \nfacilities as of November 1, 2018.  The Department has been in Compliance with Section 19.1 \nin the Downtown Jail Complex since August 1, 2018.   \n \n  Section 19.2 requires Compliance Lieutenants to review monthly reports generated by the \nERS and notify Unit Commanders and the Assistant Sheriff for Custody of the results within \nspecified time periods.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, Compliance Lieutenants must \nnotify the Unit Commander and Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations 90% of the time within \n10 days after reviewing monthly reports generated by the Early Warning System and 95% of the \ntime within 30 days.  The Department’s Ninth Self-Assessment reports that the Department \nachieved 100% Compliance with Section 19.2 in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020 at all \nthree Downtown jail facilities.  Based on the source documents provided, the Panel concludes \nthat the Department was in Compliance with Section 19.2 for the Third and Fourth Quarters of \n2020.  \n \nSection 19.3 requires Unit Commanders to determine whether problematic employees \nshould be placed on a performance mentoring program.  For each potentially problematic \nDepartment member identified through the Early Warning System, the Unit Commander must \nconsult with the appropriate Chief and document the reasons why any problematic members are \nnot placed on a performance mentoring program.  The supporting documents posted by the \nDepartment show that the Unit Commanders are reviewing the reports generated by the ERS and \nevaluating the incidents involving the potentially problematic Department members to determine \nwhether a performance mentoring program is appropriate.  The Department reports that Unit \nCommanders consult with the appropriate Chief on these issues, who indicates concurrence in \nthe respective recommendations in a written memorandum.  Accordingly, the Panel finds the \nDepartment was in Compliance with Section 19.3 in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2020.    \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 203   Filed 06/30/21   Page 27 of 30   Page ID\n#:4354\n \n          APPENDIX \n \nNO.

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the \"Rosas\" case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the \"Panel\") will \"prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n[developed by the Panel] ('Reports') at intervals the Panel shall determine.\"  This Report sets \nforth the Panel's assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from January 1, 2018, through September 30, 2018 (the \n\"Fourth Reporting Period\"),1 and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas \ncase.  It takes into consideration comments received from the Parties regarding the draft sent to \nthem on October 16, 2018, in accordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement.2\nIn May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel \"to develop a corrective action plan ('Action \nPlan') designed to ensure that [inmates] are not subject to excessive force in the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles\" (the \"Downtown Jail Complex\").3  Pursuant to Paragraph III of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Panel developed a Plan that was submitted to the Parties and the \nCourt in October 2014.4  The Plan sets forth provisions in twenty-one areas that the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff is required to implement in the Downtown Jail Complex.  The Plan was approved \nby the Court on April 7, 2016.  Under Paragraph VIII of the Settlement Agreement, \"[w]hen the \nPanel certifies that any recommendation of the Action Plan has been implemented, it shall \ncommence a period of monitoring the Defendant's compliance with respect to that \nrecommendation ('Compliance Period').\"   \nWith the introduction of the Employee Review System (\"ERS\") on August 1, 2018, to \nimplement Sections 19.1 through 19.3 of the Settlement Agreement, the Sheriff has implemented \n105 of the Panel's recommendations in the Downtown Jail Complex.5  The remaining two \nrecommendations, Section 4.10 (expansion of conflict resolution training) and Section 9.1 \n(security checks), have been superseded by the Settlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of \nResolution in United States v. County of Los Angeles, et al., CV No. 15-05903 (JEMx).   \nThe Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex on January 16 and 17, 2018, April 9 and \n10, 2018, and July 9 and 10, 2018.  The Panel spoke informally with inmates while touring the \n1 It is anticipated that in the future the Panel will report to the Court semi-annually on or \nbefore December 1 (for the second and third quarters) and on or before June 1 (for the fourth and \nfirst quarters).  \n2 Plaintiffs' Response to Monitors' Draft Report (\"Plaintiffs' Response\") was received on \nOctober 29, 2018.  Defendant's Response to Monitor's Fourth Draft Report was received on \nNovember 5, 2018. \n3 The jails in the Downtown Jail Complex are Men's Central Jail, the Twin Towers \nCorrectional Facility, and the Inmate Reception Center. \n4 In developing the plan, the Panel used the term \"Implementation Plan\" rather than \n\"Action Plan.\"  This report uses the terms \"Action Plan\" or \"Plan\" to refer to the Panel's plan. \n5 The Sheriff implemented the ERS in the rest of the jail facilities as of November 1, \n2018. \n1 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 4 of 21   Page ID #:4186\njails and also interviewed inmates identified by Plaintiffs outside the presence of Department \npersonnel.  The Panel debriefed the Custody leadership on the Panel's observations of conditions \nin the jails, and the issues raised by inmates during the interviews.  The Panel also reviewed \nforce packages and grievances pertaining to incidents involving the inmates who were \ninterviewed to determine if any of the incidents involved problematic force or misconduct by Los \nAngeles County Sheriff's Department (the \"Department\") personnel.    \nOn April 10, 2018, the Panel met with Sheriff Jim McDonnell to discuss his oversight of \nthe Department's jail operations; the Department's compliance with the Action Plan; the Panel's \nobservations concerning conditions in the Downtown Jail Complex; the nature and extent of the \nforce used by Department personnel in the jails; and the Panel's recommendation that the \nDepartment expand its use of direct supervision in housing units as an inmate management tool.  \nThe Panel also had multiple meetings with the Department's Inmate Grievance Coordinator and \nmet with the Inmate Grievance Teams at Men's Central Jail (\"MCJ\") and the Twin Towers \nCorrectional Facility (\"TTCF\") to review the Department's implementation of its new grievance \npolicies and procedures.   \nOn May 10, 2018, the Panel adopted a Revised Monitoring Plan and Compliance \nMeasures (the \"Revised Compliance Measures\"), effective April 1, 2018, that is organized \naround conceptually related topics.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Panel assesses \nthe Department's compliance with the provisions relating to the use, reporting, and investigation \nof force by selecting and reviewing 25 force packages each quarter.  Beginning with the Second \nQuarter of  2018, the Panel has qualitatively assessed the use, reporting and investigation of \nforce by Department members in each force package based upon the applicable provisions in the \nAction Plan (the \"vertical\" approach) and then determined compliance with the Plan based upon \nquantitative thresholds.  The Panel also has qualitatively assessed the Department's compliance \nwith each of the provisions of the Plan relating to the use, reporting, and investigation of force \nacross all of the force incidents reviewed by the Panel (the \"horizontal\" approach).    \nUnder the Revised Compliance Measures, the Department provides the Panel with self-\nassessments of its compliance with the non-force related provisions in the Action Plan,6 some of \nwhich (relating primarily to training) are subject to verification by auditors retained by the \nPanel.7  The Plaintiffs have expressed a concern that \"it is not clear that the Monitors may rely on \na self-assessment alone as to determine compliance with any Action Plan provision.  To do so \nappears at odds with the Monitors' duties, as spelled out in the Action Plan[.]\"  Plaintiffs' \nResponse, p. 2.  The Panel's findings pertaining to the non-force related provisions are not, \nhowever, \"based only on the LASD's reporting,\"  Id.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, \n6 The Department submitted its Self-Assessment Status Report on September 17, 2018, \nand its augmented Self-Assessment Status Report on October 1, 2018. \n7 Plaintiffs correctly note that the Department \"may only reach compliance after the \nMonitors verify the training requirements,\" but object to the Panel including \"all of these \nprovisions as in compliance in Appendix A to the Draft Fourth Report.\"  Plaintiffs' Response, pp. \n2-3.  The Panel has added a note to Appendix A to this Final Fourth Report, to indicate which\ncompliance findings are subject to verification by the Panel's auditors and to the Department's\ncontinuing compliance with the requirements for refresher training.\n2 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 5 of 21   Page ID #:4187\n \nthe Panel has \"the right to select the records that must be reviewed to determine the Department's \ncompliance with the Action Plan [and] to request and review additional records and categories of \nrecords as necessary to assess the Department's Compliance with specific provisions of the \nPlan[.]\"  During the Fourth Reporting Period, the Panel randomly selected and reviewed records \nposted by the Department to verify the Department's self-assessments of its compliance with \nvarious provisions.     \n   \n  Pursuant to the Panel's request, the Department developed a \"Use of Force Packet \nReview\" checklist to ensure that investigating Sergeants address all applicable provisions of the \nAction Plan and to facilitate the Panel's review of force packages under the Revised Compliance \nMeasures.  During the Fourth Reporting Period, the checklist was used primarily by the \nDepartment's Custody Compliance and Sustainability Bureau (\"CCSB\") to review force \npackages that were sent to the Panel.  Because the checklist was used as an \"after-the-fact\" \nreview of force packages rather than as a tool for Sergeants conducting investigations, neither \nCCSB nor the Panel were able to determine if the Department was in compliance with certain \nprovisions of the Plan (e.g., training on weapons, separation of deputies before writing reports, \ntimeliness of reports) in many cases because, as noted by Plaintiffs, \"the force packages and \ninvestigative packages did not have sufficient information.\"  Plaintiffs' Response, p. 3. \n \n  On October 29, 2018, the Department issued an Informational Bulletin to Sergeants \n\"tasked with the investigation of a force incident,\" stating that the \"Rosas Use of Force Packet \nReview is a mandatory component of the Department's Supervisor's Report on Use of Force (SH-\nR-438P).\"  The Panel believes that the use of the checklist by Sergeants who are conducting \nforce investigations will facilitate the Panel's review of the force packages and improve the \nDepartment's compliance with the Action Plan. \n \n  During the Fourth Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 43 completed force packages \nthat were selected by the Panel from a comprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the \nDepartment.  The packages were selected without input from the Department.  After reviewing \nthe completed force packages, the Panel met with Custody Commanders on two occasions to \ndiscuss force incidents that were of concern to the Panel.  The reporting of the force, the \nsupervisors' investigations, and the Commanders' reviews were also discussed in these meetings.   \n \n  One of the problems encountered by the Panel in reviewing force packages has been the \ndelay between the occurrence of the force incidents and the completion of the investigations, \nwhich was often over nine months.  In order to reduce the delay, the Department decided to \nfocus its investigative resources on force incidents occurring after January 1, 2017.  In addition, \nthe Department developed a plan for expediting the investigation of \"Non-Categorical Incidents\" \ninvolving minimal force that was captured on video by cameras in the jail facilities.  The \nDepartment adopted the plan after it was reviewed and approved by the Panel.  The focus on the \n2017 incidents and the expedited handling of the Non-Categorical Incidents resulted in \nshortening the lag time in the Third Reporting Period through December 31, 2017, but the Panel \nnoted an increase in the lag time in the first sixth months of the Fourth Reporting Period.  As a \nresult, for the Third Quarter of 2018, the Panel requested both pending and completed force \npackages, with the expectation that the Department would expedite the completion of the \npending force packages for review by the Panel during the Fourth Reporting Period.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 6 of 21   Page ID #:4188\n \nUnfortunately, due to the complexity of some of these investigations and the enhanced level of \nreview of these investigations by Commanders, the Department was not able to complete all of \nthe  pending investigations requested by the Panel before the end of the Fourth Reporting Period.  \nAs a result, the Panel only reviewed 20 of the 25 designated force incidents in the Third Quarter \nof 2018 after having reviewed 23 of the 25 designated force incidents in the Second Quarter of \n2018.  \n \n     There is one significant remaining issue that the Panel believes the Parties should \naddress.  Under the Settlement Agreement, all recommendations implemented during the same \nsix-month period are grouped together for purposes of determining compliance with the \n\"consecutive\" twelve-month period under the Action Plan, no matter how disparate the \nrecommendations may be.  The Panel urges the Parties to adopt a meaningful and achievable \nframework for determining the Department's compliance with this provision of the Settlement \nAgreement. \n \n  As has been the case since the beginning of the Initial Reporting Period, the \nCounty cooperated fully with the Panel during the Fourth Reporting Period.  The Department \nand County Counsel facilitated our visits and inmate interviews, answered our questions, \nresponded to our requests for documents and information, provided status reports regarding the \nimplementation of the grievance policies and the ERS, and engaged in constructive \nconversations about our findings regarding the use of force incidents we reviewed.  We \nappreciate their responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, and courtesy in handling our \nmonitoring requests.  Plaintiffs' counsel also has been fully cooperative with the Panel by \nidentifying inmates for the Panel to interview and discussing the issues relating to the Panel's \nmonitoring of the Department's compliance with the Action Plan.      \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 7 of 21   Page ID #:4189\n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \nIntroduction \n \n  Most of the Panel's work is centered on determining the Department’s compliance with \nover 100 specific requirements of the Settlement Agreement.  These individual provisions do \nnot, however, exist in a vacuum; rather, they are embedded in the culture and operation of Los \nAngeles County Jails.  After more than four years touring the Jails, interviewing staff and \ninmates, meeting with the Sheriff and the Custody Command staff, reviewing and approving \ntraining materials, and assessing force packages, the Panel is pleased to note two important \nchanges in Custody Operations that should not be overlooked in reviewing the Panel's report on \nthe Department's implementation of the specific provisions of the Action Plan as required by the \nSettlement Agreement. \n \n  First, the staff culture in the Jails has changed.  What had been a culture based upon \nenforcement now emphasizes communication, de-escalation, and the Department's responsibility \nfor the welfare of the inmates in its custody.  Changing an organization's culture is usually a \ndifficult and slow process.  This change has happened more quickly than might have been \npredicted, and it is the men and women of the Department who deserve credit for this change \nunder the leadership of the Sheriff and Custody Operations. \n \n  The second important change is that Department members do not appear to be using force \nto punish or retaliate against inmates or force that results in severe injuries (such as broken bones \nthat were too often the result of the force that was noted by the Citizens' Commission on Jail \nViolence).  That is not to say that all force incidents were in compliance with all of the \nprovisions of the Action Plan, but the Panel did not find situations in which inmates were beaten \nor where force was used in retaliation or as punishment.   \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  The recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that Custody \nbe headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the Sheriff be engaged \npersonally in the management of the jails, the Department's managers be held accountable for \nany failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly report to the \nBoard of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and on its compliance with the Action Plan.    \n \n  The Department has been in Compliance with Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the Action Plan \nsince well before January 1, 2017.8  Custody has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no \nother areas of responsibility since mid-2014.  It is currently under the direction of Assistant \nSheriff Kelly Harrington.  In April 2018, the Panel met with the Sheriff and reviewed his \noversight of the jail facilities and the Panel's findings and observations.  The Department has \nprovided the Panel with a log of the Sheriff's frequent meetings with Assistant Sheriff Harrington \n                                                 \n8 Use of the term Compliance in bold is a finding of Compliance as of a certain date, \nwhich in some instances are still subject to verification by the Panel's auditors.  These findings \nare set forth on the Appendix attached hereto. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 8 of 21   Page ID #:4190\n \nfrom July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, that include, among other things, the review of use of \nforce data and trends, suicide attempts and rescue force, deployment of chemical agents and \npersonal weapons, facility security concerns, assaults on staff, use of force against mentally ill \ninmates, and de-escalation techniques.   \n \n  The Department did not achieve Compliance with Section 1.3 in the Second Quarter of \n2018 because it was unable to assess \"whether supervisors appropriately addressed supervision \nof Department members involved in a substantial increase in force incidents[.]\"  It anticipates \nthat the ERS, which was implemented to establish the Early Warning System required by Section \n19, \"will now allow the Department to capture the information necessary to audit this report.\"   \n \n  The Department is in Compliance with Section 1.4 as of June 12, 2018, when the \nAssistant Sheriff for Custody Operations reported on the Department's use of force in the jails \nand its implementation of the Rosas Settlement Agreement to the Board of Supervisors.  It has \nalso provided the Panel with a copy of the transcript of the Department's presentation.  \n \n  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 as of June 30, 2018.  The \nSheriff and Assistant Sheriff visited the jail facilities as required by Section 10.1 as did the \nCaptains, Commanders, and Chiefs.  The Department documented these visits, along with the \nvisits by the Watch Commanders, as required by Section 10.2. \n \n  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require the Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotations \npolicies and (2) audit each unit’s compliance with its rotations policies.  The Department's \naugmented Self-Assessment reports 100% Compliance with rotation polices in each jail facility \nas required by Section 18.1.  The Department was, however, \"unable to assess\" Section 18.2 \nbecause, \"due to a programing error[,] the data obtained for use in the audit of the rotation policy \nwas flawed.\"  Augmented Self-Assessment Report, p. 2 \n   \n  The Department is in Compliance with Section 21.1 as of June 30, 2018.  As supported \nby the posted documentation, the Department reports that \"no member was transferred to \nCustody as a sanction for misconduct or a policy violation.\"   \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 of the Action Plan requires the Department to \"have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]\"  On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.  The Department maintains a separate, free-standing and logically organized Custody \nForce Manual that satisfies Section 2.1 and includes specific provisions that satisfy Sections 8.2 \n(Complaints of Retaliation), 17.2 (Pregnant Inmates), 20.1 (Types of Force), and 20.2 (Reactive \nForce) of the Action Plan.  The Department has been in Compliance with these Sections since \nthe Panel began monitoring the Department's compliance as of January 1, 2017. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 9 of 21   Page ID #:4191\n \n  The other recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department's use of \nforce in Custody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Sections 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate's medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Sections 20.1 through 20.3 require the Department to define Reactive Force and Planned \nForce and adopt use of force policies for Planned Force (such as cell extractions). \n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department's policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n    During the Fourth Reporting Period, the Panel undertook a number of efforts to monitor \nthe Department's use of force in the Downtown Jail Complex.  The Panel visited the jails on \nmultiple occasions, and interviewed inmates identified by Plaintiffs as having knowledge of, or \ncomplaints about, excessive use of force by Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants.  The Panel \nalso had informal discussions with a number of other inmates during these visits.  The Panel did \nnot hear complaints about excessive force by Department personnel in these informal \ndiscussions.  These inmates indicated that Department personnel have not used force to retaliate \nagainst, or punish, inmates, and they did not express any concerns about the force used by \nDepartment personnel.9  \n \n  The Panel reviewed 23 completed force packages to assess the Department's Compliance \nwith the use of force provisions in the Action Plan under the Revised Compliance Measures in \nthe Second Quarter of 2018.  The Department did not satisfy the threshold required to achieve \nCompliance with the use of force provisions in the Second Quarter of 2018.  Recognizing that \nthe cases the Panel reviewed do not constitute a random sample because the Panel focused \nprimarily on more serious Category 2 force incidents when the vast majority of force incidents \n                                                 \n9 Although some inmates have in the past expressed the belief that some Department \nmembers retaliate against inmates by imposing harsher disciplinary sanctions for founded \ninfractions, the Panel did not hear any such concerns from inmates during a recent site visit in the \nFifth Reporting Period. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 10 of 21   Page ID\n #:4192\n \nare Category 1 incidents or Non-Categorical Incidents,10 the Panel found force incidents in which \na Department member punched a recalcitrant inmate in the head or used a Taser against an \ninmate in restraints when, in the judgment of the Panel, the inmates were not assaultive and there \nwere other reasonable means to control the inmates’ behavior.11  These incidents, which the \nPanel found to be in violation of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of the Action Plan, were discussed with \nCommanders in Custody Operations following the Panel's visits to the Downtown Jail Complex \nin July 2018.12   \n \n  The Panel determined that the Department was in compliance with most of the other use \nof force provisions, except with the provision relating to escorting inmates involved in force \nincidents (Section 9.2).  In addition, the information provided by the Department was often not \nsufficient for the Panel to determine the Department's compliance with the provision relating to \nthe training on the use of authorized weapons (Section 2.10).    \n \n  In order to review 25 force packages in real time (that is, with less delay between the \nincident itself and the Panel’s review of the investigation), in the Third Quarter of 2018 the Panel \nselected 10 completed force packages and 15 pending investigations of more complex cases with \nthe understanding that the Department would expedite its review of the pending investigations so \nthat the Panel could review the completed force packages during the Fourth Reporting Period.  \nGiven the complexity of the cases and the enhanced level of review by Commanders, the \nDepartment was not able to complete all 15 of the pending investigations before the end of the \nquarter so the Panel only reviewed 20 completed force packages during the Third Quarter of \n2018.   \n \n  Of the 20 completed force packages the Panel reviewed, the Panel concluded that 15 \nwere in Compliance with the use of force provisions,13 and that the Department did not reach the \n90% threshold for Compliance with the Action Plan.  The Panel also concluded that the \nDepartment was not in compliance with the following specific provisions of the Action Plan:  \n                                                 \n10 In 2017, 84.5% of the force incidents in all of the jail facilities were either Category 1 \nincidents or Non-Categorical Incidents and 15.3% were Category 2 incidents.  There were only \nthree Category 3 incidents out of a total of 1901 incidents (one at the Inmate Reception Center, \none at MJC, and one at North County Correctional Facility). \n11 While acknowledging the Panel's concerns, the Department noted that very few force \nincidents involve either Tasers or punches to the head.  Based upon data provided by the \nDepartment, and excluding Non-Categorical Incidents, 1.7% of force incidents in the Downtown \nJail Facilities in the Second Quarter of 2018 involved the use of a Taser and less than 6% \ninvolved punches by Department personnel.   \n12 Plaintiff's Response notes \"specific examples of non-compliance with the Action Plan \nin several of the packages that [Class Counsel] has been able to review.\"  Plaintiffs' Response, p. \n4.  With one exception, these cases involve force incidents in 2016 that were not reviewed by the \nPanel during the Fourth Reporting Period.  With respect to the one case that involved a force \nincident in 2017, the Panel (and the Department) agrees with the Plaintiffs' conclusions that it \nviolated the Department's cell extraction policies.  Id., pp, 4-5. \n13 In the case involving the violation of the Department's cell extraction policies the force \nitself was not unreasonable.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 11 of 21   Page ID\n #:4193\n \nhead strikes (Section 2.6) and calling supervisors to the scene (Section 2.7), and it did not have \nsufficient information to determine the Department's compliance with the provision pertaining to \nthe use of authorized weapons (Section 2.10).14  The Panel's overarching concern was that \nDepartment members sometimes reacted too quickly in a confined environment instead waiting \nfor readily available backup resources and taking more time to plan on how to respond to a \nrecalcitrant inmate. \n \n  The Panel reviewed these incidents with Commanders in Custody Operations on the \nPanel's recent site visit during the Fifth Reporting Period.  Although the Commanders did not \nnecessarily agree that the force in these cases violated the Department's use of force polices, they \nnoted that they had ordered corrective action consisting of additional training of Department \npersonnel in several of these cases. \n \n  Although the Department was in compliance with other use of force provisions in the 20 \nforce packages reviewed by the Panel, under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Panel is \nsupposed to review 25 force packages to assess the Department's compliance with the use of \nforce provisions.  That the Panel was only able to review 20 force packages in the Third Quarter \nof 2018, precludes the Panel from finding the Department in compliance with these other force \nprovisions.15   \n \n  In order to review 25 force packages each quarter going forward, it appears that the Panel \nwill have to continue to rely on completed force packages for incidents that occurred up to \nalmost a year earlier.  The Panel is concerned, however, that reviewing force packages up to a \nyear in arrears will limit the usefulness of its findings regarding the Department's compliance \nwith its use of force policies.  Further, it appears from the most recent force tracker generated by \nthe Department that the Department is getting further behind in completing the investigations of \nthe more serious Category 2 force incidents.   \n \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining on use of force policies and on ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with \nrespect; and that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \n                                                 \n14 Plaintiffs note that Class Counsel \"has not been able to determine whether\" the \nDepartment complied with a number of other provisions of the Action Plan because force \npackages \"contain insufficient information to evaluate whether or not the LASD is in compliance \nwith certain Action Plan Provisions.\"  Plaintiffs' Response, p. 2.  This may because \"Class \nCounsel has received only videos for less than 20% of the force packages they have received.\"  \nId., p. 5.  The Panel received videos for all of the 43 force packages reviewed during the Fourth \nReporting Period and had sufficient information to evaluate the Department's compliance with \nalmost all of the use of force provisions in the Action Plan.       \n  15 The is also the case for the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force incidents.     \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 12 of 21   Page ID\n #:4194\n \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based, skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and on \"identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.\"  Section 12.1 requires that all Custody Sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.       \n \n  The Department reports that as of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing deputies and \nCustody Assistants in the downtown jails  received the one-time eight hour use of force training \nrequired by Section 3.1;16 and 95% received the one-time four hour training course in ethics, \nprofessionalism, and treating inmates with respect required by Section 3.2.  The Department also \nreports that as of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing deputies at the downtown jails and the \nmental health unit at the Century Regional Detention Facility (\"CRDF\") received the 32 hours of \ntraining on Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution Training, including eight hours of \nidentifying and working with mentally ill inmates, required by Sections 4.6 and 4.7; and 98% of \nthe additional existing deputies at CRDF, the North County Correctional Facility (\"NCCF\"), and \nthe Pitchess Detention Center jails received the eight hours training in identifying and working \nwith mentally ill inmates required by Section 4.7. \n \n  The Department reports that since the First Reporting Period beginning on July 1, 2015, \nnew deputies have been required to complete a six-week Custody Operations course that \nincludes training in ethics, professionalism and treating inmates with respect, and new Custody \nAssistants have received training in these subjects during their nine-week Academy training.  \nThe Department also reports that as of June 30, 2018, 95% of the new Deputies and 100% of the \nnew Custody Assistants have received the training required by Section 3.3.  The new Deputies \nalso have received the approved use of force and conflict resolution training in the Academy and \nthe Jail Continuum and new Custody Assistants have received use of force training and training \nin \"identifying and working with mentally ill inmates.\"  The Department reports that as of June \n30, 2018, 98% of new members have received the training required by Section 4.8 and 100% \nhave received the training required by Section 4.9. \n \n  The Department reports that as of June 30, 2018, 90.4% of the Sergeants assigned to \nCustody as of October 1, 2016,17 have received the 16 hours of training in conducting use of \nforce investigations required by Section 12.1. \n \n  The Department's reported training results are subject to verification by the Panel's \nauditors.  If verified by the auditors, the Department will have achieved Compliance with all of \nthe initial training requirements in the Action Plan.  In future reporting periods, the Panel will \nmonitor attendance at the mandated refresher courses, which is required to maintain Compliance \nwith the training provisions.    \n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \n                                                 \n16 The use of force training that was approved by the monitors includes the custody-based \nuse of force scenarios required by Section 3.4.  \n17 The Department reports that there were no Sergeants promoted to that position after \nOctober 1, 2016. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 13 of 21   Page ID\n #:4195\n \nwith a finding that it \"Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better.\"  The Department \nreports that there was one such case, and it was in Compliance with Section 3.5 as of June 30, \n2018.   \n \n  Section 3.6 requires Unit Commanders to review new Department members within six \nmonths of being initially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary \nperiod.  Based upon a random selection of personnel records, the Department reports that 73% of \nthe new Department members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6, which is below the 95% \nthreshold for Compliance.    \n \n4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  As discussed below, many of the recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the \nreporting and investigation of force used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are \nalso assessed by the Panel through a review of the completed force packages.  Other provisions \nare reported by the Department as follow:    \n \n  Section 5.1 requires the Department to track use of force investigations, reviews, and \nevaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of \ndiscrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The Department reports 92% \ncompliance, which is less than the 95% threshold for timely entering force incidents or \nallegations into the database.   \n \n  Section 8.3 requires that evaluations of investigations of inmate grievances that \nDepartment members used force to retaliate against inmates should be reviewed by the \nCustody Force Review Committee.  The Department reports that it is \"Non-Compliant\" \nwith this provision, and it is \"working on restructuring [CFRC's] scheduling to meet this \nprovision.\" \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents.  The \nDepartment's augmented Self-Assessment reports that it achieved Compliance with \nSection 11.1 in the Second Quarter of 2018 in that the Custody Force Rollout Team did \nnot delay the investigation of any of the force incidents \"beyond the period permitted by \nlaw for imposing discipline.\" \n \n  Sections 13.1 and 13.2 require the documentation of reasons and reports to the Office of \nInspector General whenever the Department does not terminate a member who has been \nfound to have been dishonest, used excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape \nElimination Act (“PREA”).  The Department reports that there were no incidents in the \nSecond Quarter of 2018 that were subject to Sections 13.1 and 13.2.  \n \n  Sections 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of an inmate for \ncriminal prosecution arising from an incident involving the use of force by a Department \nmember and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of \"officer misconduct that may \namount to criminal violations.\"  The Department reports 100% in Compliance with \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 14 of 21   Page ID\n #:4196\n \nSection 14.1 in the Second Quarter of 2018, and there \"were no criminal filings on \nDepartment personnel related to force for the 2nd Quarter of 2018.\" \n \n  For the Second Quarter of 2018, the Panel reviewed 23 completed force packages of \nincidents.  The Department did not satisfy the 90% threshold required by the Revised \nCompliance Measures for the reporting and investigation of force provisions in the Second \nQuarter of 2018.  Department members' own use of force reports were consistent with videotapes \nof incidents from Closed Circuit Television cameras, but they did not always report force used \nby other members or describe an inmate's visible injuries.  The Panel is cognizant, however, that \nsometimes Department members involved in a force incident may not be able to observe all of \nthe force used by other members.   \n \n  Also in the 23 completed force packages, some force reports were not timely or it could \nnot be determined if the reports were timely (Section 15.1), and the Panel could not always \ndetermine if the Department members involved in the force incidents were separated before they \nwrote their reports.  (Section 15.6.)  The Panel also noted that there were instances in which \ninmates were not interviewed away from other inmates.  (Section 12.2.)  Finally, the Panel asked \nthe Commanders to provide additional analyses of these issues in their reviews of the force \npackages.     \n   \n  For the Third Quarter of 2018, the Panel reviewed 20 completed force packages to assess \ncompliance with the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the reporting and investigation of \nforce incidents.  The Panel concluded that 17 (or 85%) were in Compliance with these \nprovisions, which was below the 90% threshold for Compliance.  The Panel again concluded that \nthe Department was not in compliance with the provision regarding the location of inmate \nwitness interviews.  In addition, the information provided by the Department was often not \nsufficient for the Panel to determine the Department's compliance with provisions relating to the \ntimeliness of reports, and the separation of Department personnel after a force incident.18  The \nPanel also noted a pattern whereby the Commanders engaged in more thorough reviews of the \ntactics leading up to the force incidents than the reasonableness of the actual force used by the \nmembers.  The Panel acknowledges, however, that Commanders have been responsive to Panel's \ncomments and the Commanders' reviews have been more helpful to the Panel in its more recent \nreviews of the force incidents.   \n \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  The Action Plan requires extensive changes in how the Department handles inmate \ngrievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016, the Department issued a new \"Inmate \nGrievance Manual\" (Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual) to implement a new grievance \nsystem.   \n \n                                                 \n18 The Panel anticipates that many of these issues will be resolved once Sergeants begin \nusing the checklist as intended to address all of the applicable provisions of the Rosas Action \nPlan.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 15 of 21   Page ID\n #:4197\n \n  The Panel assessed the Department's implementation of the new grievance system as \nfollows: \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.6 require that separate forms for inmate grievances be reasonably \navailable to inmates and that the forms have specific check boxes.  Section 7.1 requires the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the \nDepartment’s Conflict Resolution Policy.19  Based upon site visits, the Panel concluded that the \nforms meeting these requirements of the Action Plan are reasonably available to inmates.  \nSections 6.4 and 6.5 also require the Department to establish that use of force grievances and \nretaliation grievances against staff are brought to the attention of Unit Commanders and properly \nhandled.   Based upon a review of the relevant grievances in the randomly selected month of \nApril, the Department reports 100% Compliance with these provisions.  These results for \nSection 6.5 are still subject to verification by the Panel.     \n \n  Sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the Action Plan set forth specific requirements for the \ndetermination, handling, and notifications of non-medical emergencies.  Based upon the \nselection and review of the grievances marked \"emergency\" in the month randomly selected by \nthe Panel, the Department reports 100% Compliance with Section 6.7 and 98% Compliance with \nSection 6.8.20  The results for Sections 6.7 and 6.8 have been verified by the Panel.  Although \nsome of the grievances that the Department determined were non-emergent could be viewed as \nemergencies, the Department handled the grievances expeditiously as required by the nature of \nthe grievance.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with the provisions.   \n \n  Section 6.9 requires that emergency grievances be forwarded to the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator.  Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 require the Inmate Grievance Coordinator to track the \nDepartment's handling of inmate grievances, provide a monthly report to the Unit Commander \nand senior management in Custody on the status of inmate grievances, and analyze inmate \ngrievances for problematic trends.  During the Fourth Reporting Period, the Panel met with the \nDepartment's Inmate Grievance Coordinator on several occasions to discuss the significant \nprogress the Department has made in implementing the new grievance system and the reports \ngenerated for the Department's managers regarding inmate grievances and requests, grievances \nagainst staff, and trends at the different facilities.  The Department provided documentation \nshowing that the Inmate Grievance Coordinator received the information about emergency \ngrievances required by Section 6.9 and that detailed reports were prepared by the Inmate \nGrievance Coordinator for managers pursuant to the requirements of Sections 6.13, 6.14, and \n6.15.  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 6.9, 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15. as of June 30, \n2018.  \n \n  Sections 6.10 and 6.12 require that grievances be collected daily, logged in, and tracked \nin an inmate grievance database.  The Department reports that 84% of the grievances were \n                                                 \n19 The Department reports that only one grievance was resolved through the Conflict \nResolution Policy in the Second Quarter of 2018. \n20 The Department determined that the first 50 grievances marked \"emergency\" were not \nactually emergencies.  Thus the Department identified five grievances that were actual \nemergencies to determine that they were handled in accordance with Section 6.7.    \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 16 of 21   Page ID\n #:4198\n \ncollected timely, which is below the 95% threshold for Compliance with Section 6.10.  The \nDepartment also provided a spreadsheet showing that 100% of the grievances in the randomly \nselected months were entered into the database and handled as required by Section 6.12.  \nAccordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 6.12 as of June 30, 2018.   \n \n  Section 6.11 requires that the Custody Division Manual provide that failing to comply \nwith Department policies requiring proper handling of inmate grievances may be cause for \ndiscipline.  The Department reports that it \"did not complete any investigations for the relevant \ntype of grievances in Second Quarter 2018.\"   \n \n  Sections 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, and 7.2 set forth the deadlines for filing use of force and \nPREA grievances,21 the Department's initial responses, inmates' right to appeal, and the \nDepartment's notifications of the results of the investigations.  The Department provided reports \nreflecting that it adhered to these deadlines for all grievances selected pursuant to the applicable \nCompliance Measures during the Second Quarter of 2018 for Sections 6.17 (use of force),22 6.18 \n(PREA), 6.19 (initial response), and 6.20 (right to appeal).  The Panel agrees that the Department \nis in Compliance with Sections 6.17, 6.18, and 6.20 as of June 30, 2018, but the Panel believes \nthat more data and analysis is needed to determine whether the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 6.19.  The Department reports that it will expand the universe of grievances it will \nassess to determine if it is in Compliance with Section 6.19 beginning with the Third Quarter of \n2018. \n \n  The policies adopted by the Department for the new inmate grievance system do not \n\"establish a centralized unit with a sworn supervisor, custody assistants, and civilian personnel\" \nthat is \"co-located\" in TTCF and the Pitchess Detention Center as required by Section 6.16, \nalthough the policies do provide for additional centralized oversight.  Based upon interviews \nwith the Inmate Grievance Coordinator, meetings with the Inmate Grievance Teams, including \ninterviews by the Monitor in the DOJ case with Inmate Grievance Teams at the other facilities, \nthe Panel believes that the decentralized grievance system is effectively and efficiently handling \ninmate grievances and requests for service and, therefore, the Department is in Compliance with \nthis provision.   \n \n  Section 7.3 requires the Department to \"ensure that there are adequate avenues for \nconstructive prisoner-staff communication[.]\"  The Department provided logs of Town Hall \nmeeting and Prisoner Staff Communications at MCJ and TTCF during the randomly selected \nmonth of April.  The Panel is of the view that the Department is in Compliance with Section 7.3 \nas of June 30, 2018. \n \n  Section 8.1 prohibits Department personnel from retaliating against inmates.  The \nDepartment's summaries reflect that the Department is in Compliance with Section 8.1 as of \nJune 30, 2018, in that discipline was imposed for the one founded grievance in the First Quarter \n                                                 \n21 Section 6.18 provides that there is no deadline for filing PREA grievances.   \n22 The Department reports that it accepts all use of force investigations.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 17 of 21   Page ID\n #:4199\n \nof 2018 and for the two founded grievances in the Second Quarter of 2018.23  The discipline in \nthese cases consisted of lower level Performance Log Entries, which is imposed when the \nmember's conduct is not egregious or malicious, and it is considered to be a training issue. \n \n6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include \"a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints\" identified in this recommendation.  \nThe Department included such a separate section in the Manual, effective December 1, 2015. \n   \n  Sections 17.1, 17.3, 17.4, and 17.6 through 17.9 (the \"Restraint Provisions\") of the \nAction Plan require the Department to provide the Panel \"with a list of incidents in which \ninmates were placed in a Safety Chair, restrained to a fixed object for more than 20 minutes, \nsubjected to security restraints for an extended length of time. . .or subjected to a multi-point \nrestraint in the Downtown Jail Complex[.]\"  To assess Compliance, the Panel is supposed to \n\"select generally 25 incidents involving Security Restraints\" from the list supplied by the \nDepartment to assess the Department's compliance with the security restraint provisions.   \n \n  During the Fourth Reporting Period, the Department generated a list of incidents \ninvolving the use of a Safety Chair, but the list did not include the other Security Restraints listed \nabove.  The Department reports that it \"is currently working to document\" the use of the other \nsecurity restraints, which it anticipates providing to the Panel in the next reporting period.   \n \n  Section 17.10 provides that medication cannot be used solely for security purposes.  The \nDepartment provided a log of the Administration of Involuntary Medications in the Second \nQuarter of 2018, which shows all of the medication was administered pursuant to a Court Order \nfor inmates incompetent to stand trial or in response to a petition for a lack of capacity to refuse \nmedications.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 17.10 as of June 30, \n2018.  \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Sections 19.1 through 19.3 require the Department to develop a formal Early Warning \nSystem to identify potentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel \nmet with the Department during the Fourth Reporting Period to review and discuss the ERS \n                                                 \n23 Although the supporting documents for the grievances against staff show the results of \nthe investigations, they do not show how the grievances were investigated or the basis of the \nDepartment's findings or discipline.  As a result, the Panel is unable to qualitatively assess the \nDepartment's reported conclusions regarding the actions of the employees that were the subject \nof the inmates' grievances.  In the future, the Department should summarize or describe the \ninvestigations and the basis for its findings, which can be done for a random sample, depending \non the number of these investigations.  In addition, the Panel had questions about the \nDepartment's responses to inmates stating that the Department was unable to make a \ndetermination regarding the inmates' grievances, in cases where the Department had determined \nthat staff performance could have been better or should have been different. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 18 of 21   Page ID\n #:4200\n \nproposed by the Department to establish the Early Warning System.  The Panel approved the \nERS in July and it was implemented by the Department on August 1, 2018, as a pilot program in \nthe Downtown Jail Complex.  It was implemented in the rest of the jail facilities effective \nNovember 1, 2018.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 19.1 in the \nDowntown Jail Complex as of August 1, 2018.  The Department did not report to the Monitors \nthe results of its reviews of the ERS for the required notifications and consultations during last \ntwo months of the Fourth Reporting Period.     \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 195   Filed 11/15/18   Page 19 of 21   Page ID\n #:4201\n \n          APPENDIX \n \nNO.

INTRODUCTION \n \n  Correctional officers should strike inmates‟ heads only as a matter of last resort.  \nBut in the Los Angeles County Jails, that is not the reality.   \n  As explained below, there is clear evidence that the Los Angeles County Sheriff‟s \nDepartment (“LASD”) deputies have used head strikes with alarming regularity in the \nLos Angeles County jails.  In many of those incidents the head strikes have caused \nsignificant injuries.  The manner and frequency of such head strikes strongly suggests an \ninappropriate use of force by deputies.   \n  In recent years, Los Angeles Sheriff‟s deputies have stomped on inmates‟ heads, \neven  after  shackling  those  inmates‟  hands.    They  have  bashed  inmates‟  faces  into \nconcrete walls.  They have fractured inmates‟ facial bones – noses, jaws, cheekbones, or \neye sockets.  The ACLU is aware of least 11 inmates who have had their facial bones \nbroken by LASD deputies in the past three years.  One inmate has lost vision in one eye.  \nOthers have undergone surgery. \n  Sixty-four people have made sworn statements describing incidents in which \ndeputies targeted inmates‟ heads for attack between 2009 and 2012.  These are not mere \nunsubstantiated complaints.1  The ACLU has corroborated 12 of these allegations of head \ninjuries with secondary evidence, such as medical records, photographic documentation, \nor civilian reports.  In several other instances, inmate witnesses have corroborated reports \nof deputy-on-inmate head strikes.   \n  If history is any guide, LASD will respond to this evidence by attacking the ACLU2 \nand blaming inmates.  They will argue that inmates‟ accounts of deputies using \n                                                        \n1 Fifty-four declarants are inmates or former inmates; one is a visitor to MCJ; four \ndeclarants are civilian eyewitnesses; five are inmates or former inmates who witnessed \ndeputies striking other inmates‟ heads. \n2 The day after the ACLU published its September 2011 report on deputy on inmate \nabuse in the jails, which included accounts of deputies beating inmates from two jails \nchaplains, a volunteer jail tutor, and a jail monitor, Sheriff Baca stated, “[t]ruth is hard to \nfind if you‟re in a rush, and the ACLU obviously felt a rush to get the report out. They \ndon‟t have any substantial proof other than accusations,” available at \nhttp://www.scpr.org/news/2011/09/29/29150/la-sheriff-baca-dismisses-aclu-report-jail-\nbrutali/. \n1 \n \nPage 5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 4 of 13   Page ID #:1735\nunjustified force are false,3 and they will allege that inmates were the aggressors.4  But \neven assuming that the LASD is correct that the inmates were aggressive towards \ndeputies, the attempt to blame inmates does not absolve the LASD from its use of \nexcessive and illegal force.  For even where inmates are the aggressors, the fundamental \nwidely recognized rule regarding use of force by a custodial officer is that head strikes \nare almost never permissible.  Accordingly, head injuries should be an exceedingly rare \nconsequence of a use of force incident, even when inmates are aggressive.    \n  The reasons for this rule are clear:  deputy-on-inmate head strikes are unnecessarily \ndangerous to both inmates and deputies.  According to Steve Martin, a former \ncorrectional officer and a nationally recognized corrections expert: “because closed fist \nhead strikes, strikes to the head with blunt objects, using force so that inmates‟ heads \nstrike solid objects such as walls or floors, and/or kicks [to the head] by deputies produce \nneedless and oftentimes serious injuries (and oftentimes corresponding officer hand \ninjuries), and such tactics are not typically as effective in neutralizing inmate resistance \n                                                        \n3 In September 2011, an LASD spokesperson responded to a third ACLU report detailing \nscores of incidents of deputy on inmate abuse by saying that department thoroughly \ninvestigated all complaints of abuse that it received and that most were unsubstantiated. \nSee Jennifer Medina, Report Details Wide Abuse in Los Angeles Jail System, NY Times, \nSept. 28, 2011, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/us/aclu-suit-details-\nwide-abuse-in-los-angeles-jail-system.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&hp.  In May 2010, the \nLASD spokesperson responded to an ACLU report containing numerous sworn \nstatements of deputy abuse of inmates by stating that they were “absolutely false.”  See \nACLU: LA County jail guards perpetuate violence, KPCC Radio, May 5, 2010 available \nat http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/05/05/14828/aclu-says-la-county-jail-guard-\nperpetuate-violence/. \n4 \"‟Most of our uses of force, even when they're inappropriate, are provoked by the \ninmate,‟ [LASD Commander James] Hellmold said. „That's the reality of the job.‟” Jack \nLeonard and Robert Faturechi, D.A. In the Dark On Jail Probes, Los Angeles Times, \nDec. 4, 2011 available at \nhttp://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/04/local/la-me-jails-da-20111205.  In fact, the Los \nAngeles Citizens‟ Commission on Jail Violence has found that even according to the \nLASD‟s own statistics, in the majority of cases (57%) in 2011 where deputies used force \nagainst inmates, the inmates had not assaulted the deputies.   Finding available at \nhttp://ccjv.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CCJV-090712-Exhibits.pdf./ The \nCommission also found that “LASD personnel have used force against inmates \ndisproportionate to the threat posed, or when there was no threat at all.”   Id.  (emphasis \nadded).  The Commission also found the LASD‟s “Process for Reviewing and \nInvestigating Force Incidents Is Not Effective” and that “[t]here are multiple deficiencies \nin LASD‟s Investigatory Process.” Id.  . \n2 \n \nPage 6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 5 of 13   Page ID #:1736\nas many other approved tactics that are less potentially injurious, such hard impact strikes \nto the head should be very infrequently used.”5  Deputies should only employ hard strikes \nto the head in situations “in which the inmate is engaged in aggravated active physical \naggression (officer(s) is subject to death or great bodily harm) and other less injurious \ntactics are impracticable.”6   \n  According to Mr. Martin, the impropriety of head strikes and the frequency with \nwhich inmates in the County jails suffered injuries to their heads “are strong evidence \nthat Los Angeles Sheriffs frequently used excessive and unreasonable force, even if the \ndeputies had used force on the injured inmates because those inmates had been \naggressive towards, or assaulted the deputies.”7  \n \nII.  METHODOLOGY  \n \n  Over the years, the ACLU Foundation of Southern California received and collected \nseveral thousand complaints and reports from inmates, including inmate declarations, in \nthe Los Angeles County Jail system in the past year.  The ACLU receives these \ncomplaints as a result of its monitoring role in the jails: pursuant to a series of court-\napproved agreements between the ACLU and the LASD, the ACLU has monitored \nconditions in the county jails since 1985.  The ACLU has greater access to jail facilities \nthan the general public; thus, ACLU representatives are able to speak with inmates and \nobserve jail conditions first-hand. \n  As part of their monitoring efforts, representatives from the ACLU‟s Jails Project \nregularly visit the jail facilities and process inmate complaints.  In addition, inmates and \nfamily members of inmates frequently write letters and make phone calls to the ACLU to \nmake complaints about scores of issues, including deputy-on-inmate assaults.  Signs \nposted in common areas of the jail facilities tell inmates that they may contact the \nACLU‟s Jails Project with complaints about jail conditions.   \n  The information in this report comes from the thousands of complaints the ACLU \nreceived in the past four years, in addition to the dozens of jail tours and face-to-face \n                                                        \n5 Declaration of Steve Martin, ¶ 21 (September 21, 2012). \n6 Martin Decl., ¶ 21.  \n7 Martin Decl., ¶ 25. \n \n3 \n \nPage 7\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 6 of 13   Page ID #:1737\ninterviews with inmates ACLU representatives conducted.  Medical records, witness \naccounts, and photographs also provide documentation of deputy-on-inmate head strikes \nin the jail system.   \n  The report‟s findings are also based on the observations of an expert:  Steve Martin, a \nformer correctional officer who is now a correctional consultant who has been retained as \na corrections expert by, among others, the United States Department of Justice‟s Civil \nRights Division.  Mr. Martin has reviewed and/or helped develop use of force policies \nand practices for scores of confinement operations throughout the United States and its \nterritories, including for the United States government.  In addition, Mr. Martin has \nserved as the court-appointed monitor in class-action lawsuits regarding use of force \nclaims in jails and prisons, and jointly monitored the New York City Department of \nCorrections over use of force at its jail on Rikers Island.   \n  Mr. Martin reviewed a random sample of the reports of head injuries the ACLU has \ngathered, analyzing 19 uses of force incidents (roughly one-third of the total).  For each \nincident, he reviewed inmate declarations and any supporting documentation, such as \nphotographs of injuries and medical records.  \n  The head injuries and attacks detailed in this report are not exhaustive.  They simply \nrepresent the experiences of those inmates who brought their beatings and injuries to the \nattention of the ACLU.  As the ACLU has demonstrated in the past, many inmates are too \nfearful of deputy retaliation to report acts of deputy-on-inmate violence,8 are threatened \nby deputies with more beatings,9 are not taken to the medical clinic or hospital when they \nask the deputies for medical attention,10 or deputies tell them that they need to say that \n                                                        \n8 See Sarah Liebowitz, Peter Eliasberg, Margaret Winter, & Esther Lim, “Cruel and \nUsual Punishment:  How a Savage Gang of Deputies Controls LA County Jails” (2011), \nfiled in Rutherford v.

SEVERE HEAD INJURIES RESULTING FROM HEAD STRIKES ARE \nPREVALENT IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAILS \n \n  The types of injuries inmates have suffered evidence the extent of deputy-on-\ninmate head strikes in the Los Angeles County Jails.  In the last three years, inmates have \nsubmitted sworn statements documenting the following: \n  Deputies have broken facial bones of at least 11 inmates.12  \n  Deputies have blinded an inmate in one eye.13  \n  Deputies have sent three inmates to the operating room.14   \n  Deputies have left 14 inmates with facial gashes – often just above their eyes – \nso deep they required sutures.15   \n  “[T]he number and extent of head injuries sustained in these use of force incidents \nstrongly suggest that LACJ deputies at alarming levels too frequently employ hard impact \nhead strikes during use of force incidents,” Mr. Martin concluded after reviewing a \nrandom sample of the incidents of deputy-on-inmate head strikes documented by the \nACLU.16  The injury reports, Mr. Martin said, “reflected an exceedingly high incidence \nof head injuries many of which included multiple head injuries to the same inmate.  \n                                                        \n11 Declaration of Mr. Y, ¶ 23 (July 5, 2011); Declaration of Mr. VV, ¶ 8 (March 28, \n2011). \n12 Declaration of Mr. R, ¶ 24 (Apr. 12, 2011); Declaration of Mr. K, ¶ 8 (July 14, 2010); \nDeclaration of Mr. L, ¶ 7 (July 20, 2010); Declaration of Mr. XX, ¶¶ 15-16 (Apr. 4, \n2012); Declaration of Mr. FF, ¶¶ 30-32 (Apr. 19, 2011); Declaration of Mr. J, ¶ 11 (July \n26, 2010); Declaration of Mr. ZZ, ¶ 31 (Feb. 24, 2012); Declaration of Mr. G, ¶ 14 (Oct. \n21, 2009); Declaration of Mr. MM, ¶ 52 (June 22, 2011); Declaration of Mr. OO, ¶¶ 14-\n15 (Aug. 22 2011); Declaration of Mr. PP, ¶ 6 (May 10, 2010). \n13 Declaration of Mr. BB, ¶ 28 (Apr. 12, 2011). \n14 Mr. BB Decl., ¶ 28; Mr. FF Decl., ¶¶ 30-32; Mr. J Decl., ¶ 11. \n15 Declaration of Mr. D , ¶ 6 (Oct. 23, 2009); Declaration of Mr. T, ¶ 11 (Aug. 2, 2011); \nDeclaration of Mr. UU , ¶¶ 17-18 (Oct. 28, 2011); Declaration of Mr. Z, ¶ 31 (Nov. 24, \n2010); Mr. BB Decl., ¶ 28; Declaration of Mr. EE,¶ 20 (Aug. 4, 2011); Declaration of \nMr. A, ¶ 6 (June 24, 2009); Declaration of Mr. H, ¶ 7 (Oct. 26, 2009); Mr. XX Decl., ¶¶ \n15-16; Mr. FF Decl., ¶¶ 30-32; Declaration of Mr. F, ¶ 6 (June 16, 2009); Declaration of  \nMr. NN, ¶ 50 (Aug. 22, 2011); Declaration of Mr. EEE, ¶¶ 10, 13 (Jan. 1, 2012); Mr. E, ¶ \n8 (Oct. 7, 2009). \n16 Martin Decl., ¶ 14. \n5 \n \nPage 9\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 8 of 13   Page ID #:1739\nMoreover, many of these injuries required medical procedures such as suturing and \nstaples.  Some of the inmates sustained facial fractures and tooth injuries while others \nrequired hospitalization to attend their injuries.”17  \n  The sworn statements, photographs, and medical records that are being submitted to \nthe Court today demonstrate both the seriousness of the injuries resulting from deputy-\non-inmate head strikes in the Los Angeles County jails and the frequency with which \nthey occur.  In addition, the ACLU has recently obtained a declination memorandum \nfrom the Los Angeles County District Attorney‟s office that summarizes LASD \ninvestigators‟ findings on use of force by LASD personnel against an inmate that \ninvolved an LASD supervisor directing deputies to strike an inmate in the head, even \nthough the inmate was lying on the ground and there were four to six LASD personnel \nsurrounding him when the supervisor gave the order to strike the inmate in the head.  \nFinally, internal LASD memoranda from the last few years also discuss inmates who had \nhead injuries in the wake of force used by deputies.18   \n  Several of the most severe injuries are briefly described below: \n \n    Declaration of Mr. FF, dated April 19, 2011, ¶¶ 14-15, ¶¶ 30-34 (Deputy punched \nthe side of inmate‟s face; threw inmate to floor and repeatedly kicked inmate‟s \nhead, jaw, and ear.  Inmate suffered a fractured jaw, which was wired shut for one \nmonth to heal.  Inmate required surgery to remove the lens from his eye.  Inmate \nneeds future eye surgeries, including the insertion of a tube to drain fluid from his \neye; a doctor told inmate that his vision may be permanently impaired.  Inmate \nreceived stitches to the inside of his ear);  \n \n    Declaration of Mr. J, dated, July 26, 2010, ¶ 4, ¶¶ 8-11 (Deputy punched inmate \nin head with closed fist; two deputies then repeatedly punched inmate in the face \n                                                        \n17 Martin Decl., ¶ 14. \n18 See Memorandum of Captain Gregory H. Johnson, January 23, 2010 at page 1 (noting \ninmate suffered bruises on left and right sides of his head); id. at page 2 (noting inmate \nsuffered significant injuries to his right cheek); id. at page 3 (noting inmate, whose jaw \nhad been wired shut due to a prior incident, suffered injuries to his head and jaw); id. \n(noting deputy elbowed inmate in the face); id. at page 4 (noting inmate had been kicked \nin the face); id. at page 5 (noting inmate suffered bruising on his forehead and two large \nred knots on the top of his head); See Memorandum of Lieutenant Mark A. McCorkle, \nNovember 23, 2009 at page 3 (noting “[r]epeated blows to the head of inmates, causing \ninjury to deputies” as one of most prolific tactical and policy issues observed in review of \nmore than 100 use of force incidents between 2005 and 2009 in Men‟s Central Jail). \n \n6 \n \nPage 10\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 9 of 13   Page ID #:1740\nand head, causing the inmate to lose consciousness.  When the inmate regained \nconsciousness, the deputies were still attacking him.  Inmate needed surgery to \nremove a hematoma in his ear.  He suffered facial fractures, a chipped tooth, and \nother trauma); \n \n    Declaration of Mr. BB, dated April 12, 2011, ¶¶ 15-17, ¶ 28 (Deputies repeatedly \npunched, hit, and kicked inmate in the head and body.  Deputies ignored inmate‟s \ncomplaints about blurry vision and a swollen head.  When they finally allowed \nhim to see a doctor, the doctor diagnosed a detached retina and performed \nsurgery);   \n \n    Declination memorandum re: multiple deputies use of force on Gabriel Carrillo \nduring Mr. Carrillo‟s visit to Men‟s Central Jail, dated April 6, 2012 (an LASD \nsergeant directed deputies to strike Mr. Carrillo in the head with “personal \nweapons.”  At the time of the order, Mr. Carrillo was already surrounded by at \nleast five deputies.  The attack left Mr. Carrillo with a broken nose, a swollen eye \nwith ecchymosis, and other facial trauma, including a gash over his right eyebrow \nthat required stitches.) \n \nDeputy-on-inmate head strikes have resulted in at least 11 inmates suffering broken \nfacial bones in the last three years, including fractured jaws, noses, cheekbones, and eye \nsockets.19  Several of the attacks are detailed below: \n    Declaration of Mr. K, dated July 14, 2010, ¶¶ 5-8 (Deputies hit inmate‟s head and \nneck.  Although inmate did not initiate the altercation, deputies alleged that he \ndid, and more deputies joined the attack.  Deputies broke inmate‟s nose.  They \ncaused an artery in his brain to swell.  They tore a ligament in inmate‟s ankle);  \n \n    Declaration of Mr. R, dated April 12, 2011, ¶¶ 6-16, ¶ 24 (After inmate cursed at \na deputy for denying the inmate dinner and putting the inmate on lockdown, the \ndeputy punched the inmate in the eye with a closed fist and repeatedly kneed \ninmate in the face.  Other deputies joined the attack.  One deputy stepped on \ninmate‟s face.  Inmate was left with a broken nose, a gash on his forehead, and a \nswollen eye); \n \n    Declaration of Mr. ZZ, dated March 13, 2012, ¶¶ 22-29, ¶ 31 (Deputies repeatedly \npunched inmate in the head and ear.  Inmate suffered a fracture near the bottom of \nhis right eye.  He needed stitches on his forehead.  His ear bled for more than a \nday following the attack). \n \nFourteen inmates have reported wounds grave enough to require sutures or staples.  \nSeveral of these wounds are described in detail below: \n                                                        \n19 Many others have suffered broken bones in other parts of their bodies as a result of use \nof force by deputies. \n7 \n \nPage 11\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 10 of 13   Page ID\n #:1741\n    Declaration of Mr. NN, dated August 22, 2011, ¶ 2, ¶ 31, ¶¶ 36-45, ¶ 50 (After \ndeputy accused inmate of calling him “gay,” he slammed inmate‟s face into a \ncement wall.  Inmate lost consciousness.  When he came to, he was handcuffed.  \nA deputy was sitting on his back, punching his face and bringing a closed fist \ndown on the back of his head.  Deputies then used a Taser gun on inmate, while \ncontinuing to beat him.  Inmate suffered a concussion, and needed 35 stitches to \nhis forehead); \n \n    Declaration of Mr. H, dated October 26, 2009, ¶¶ 6-9 (After inmate complained \nabout not receiving showers, deputies punched him in the face, eventually beating \nhim so severely that inmate required stitches on his eyebrow, staples on his head, \nand surgery on his knee.  In addition, he suffered a broken leg.  Inmate was \nhandcuffed during the entire assault); \n \n    Declaration of Mr. BB, dated August 2, 2011, ¶ 9, ¶¶ 20-22 (Two deputies \nrepeatedly punched and kicked inmate‟s head, face, and body while inmate lay on \nthe ground, and slammed his face into the ground.  In addition to suffering a \nbroken collarbone, inmate needed stitches above both eyebrows and bruises under \nhis eyes.  Inmate suffered dizziness and a ringing sound in his ear). \n \n \nIV.  PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIRM MANY OF THE \nINMATE STATEMENTS ABOUT SIGNIFICANT HEAD INJURIES   \n \n  Independent evidence corroborates many of the deputy-on-inmate head strikes the \nACLU has documented over the past three years. 20 For 1221 of the most severe head \ninjuries inmates have reported, the ACLU has obtained medical records, photographs, or \ncivilian witness reports that substantiate the inmates‟ accounts.  In addition, inmate \nwitnesses have corroborated several other reports of deputy-on-inmate head strikes.   \nWhen confronted with accounts of deputy-on-inmate attacks, the LASD has a \ncommon refrain: Blame the inmates or claim they are lying.22  But the corroborating \ndocuments the ACLU has gathered demonstrate that the use of force is excessive \n                                                        \n20 While the frequency of head strikes and head injuries appears to have declined since \nSeptember/October 2011 when the Los Angeles Times reported that the FBI is \ninvestigating deputy abuse in the jails, the ACLU issued its September 2011 report, and \nthe Board of Supervisors appointed the Citizens‟ Commission on Jail Violence, the \nACLU has nonetheless received three reports of head strikes by deputies since that time.   \n21 Declaration of Mr. S; Declaration of Scott Budnick, See Declination memorandum \nconcerning use of force by deputies on Gabriel Carrillo and photograph; Declaration of \nMr. Y; Mr. BB Decl.; Mr. EE Decl.; Mr. H Decl.; Declaration of Paulino Juarez; Mr. FF \nDecl.; Mr. ZZ Decl.; Mr. F Decl.; Mr. NN Decl. \n22 See footnotes 1, 2, supra. \n8 \n \nPage 12\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 11 of 13   Page ID\n #:1742\nregardless of the purported provocation, and that inmates clearly are not lying about \nsuffering severe head injuries at the hands of LASD deputies.  Several attacks for which \nthe ACLU has obtained corroborating evidence are described below: \n    Declaration of Esther Lim, ACLU of Southern California Jails Project \nCoordinator, dated July 27, 2011, ¶ 3, ¶¶ 6-8 (After receiving a report that \ndeputies had beaten inmate Mr. BB, Ms. Lim visited him in the Los Angeles \nMedical Center.  Ms. Lim reported that the sclera in both of Mr. BB‟s eyes were \ncompletely red.  He had dark bruises under both eyes, stitches over both \neyebrows, a swollen lip, a broken collarbone, and bruising on his body.  Ms. \nLim‟s account corroborated the injuries Mr. BB reported receiving; Declaration of \nMr. BB, dated August 2, 2011, ¶ 9, 20-22); \n \n    Photographs and medical records of Mr. NN, dated March 29, 2011 (Photographs \nof Mr. NN taken March 29, 2011, show a large sutured wound on Mr. NN‟s \nforehead.  These photographs support the account Mr. NN gave in a declaration, \ndated August 22, 2011, ¶¶ 36-45, ¶ 50, in which Mr. NN recounted how a deputy \nslammed his face into a cement wall, and deputies then punched his face and \nhead.  Mr. NN reported suffering a concussion and needing 35 stitches to his \nforehead.  Mr. NN‟s account is further substantiated by four declarations from \ninmate witnesses23); \n \n    Medical records of Mr. FF, dated July 2010 (Medical records from Los Angeles \nMedical Center substantiate the injuries Mr. FF reported receiving at the hands of \ndeputies in his declaration, dated April 19, 2011, ¶¶ 14-15, ¶¶ 30-34, in which he \nreported suffering a fractured jaw, surgery to remove the lens from his eye, and \nstitches to the inside of his ear). \n \n \nV.  WHEN DEPUTIES MUST USE FORCE AGAINST INMATES, THEY \nHAVE MORE APPROPRIATE TACTICS AT THEIR DISPOSAL THAN HEAD \nSTRIKES, WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS CONSTITUTE UNREASONABLE AND \nEXCESSIVE FORCE \n \n  There may be situations that warrant deputy-on-inmate force, such as inmate-on-\ndeputy assaults.  But even when force is warranted, according to Mr. Martin, head strikes \nare not the answer.  There are ways of handling aggressive inmates without causing such \nsevere – and potentially lasting – injury.  When the deputies use closed fist strikes, they \nalso risk significant injury to their own hands.  Furthermore, head strikes are not as \n                                                        \n23 Declaration of Mr. GGG, ¶¶ 12-13 (Aug. 19, 2011); Declaration of Mr. HHH, ¶¶ 12-19 \n(Aug. 19, 2011); Declaration of Mr. III, ¶¶ 5-20 (Aug. 19, 2011); Declaration of Mr. JJJ, \n¶¶ 9-18 (Aug. 19, 2011). \n9 \n \nPage 13\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 12 of 13   Page ID\n #:1743\neffective as other types of force in restraining inmates.  \n  The “goal in every situation in which force is appropriate is to bring the situation \nunder control as quickly as possible by restraining the inmate,” said Mr. Martin.24  “Head \nstrikes are improper both because they create a far greater risk of severe injury than other \nwell-accepted tactics, and they are less effective means of restraining or immobilizing the \ninmate than these tactics.”25   \n  According to Mr. Martin, the tactics deputies should rely on in situations \ndemanding force include: joint locks, pressure points, arm bars, wrist locks, and strikes to \nmuscled areas of the body, such as thighs.  “Such defensive tactics are intended to \nneutralize the inmate‟s aggression and facilitate restraint without creating a needless risk \nof serious injury to either the inmate or the officer,” Mr. Martin said.26  \n  The severe head injuries detailed in this report evidence the fact that Los Angeles \nSheriff‟s Department deputies frequently strike inmates in the head, using “excessive and \nunreasonable force,” Mr. Martin said.27  Even if the situations described in this report \nwarranted the use of force, according to Mr. Martin, deputies are unnecessarily \nimperiling inmates‟ health.   \nVI.  CONCLUSION \n  The prevalence of head strikes and head injuries strongly support the recent \npreliminary findings of the Citizens‟ Commission on Jail Violence, which the Board of \nSupervisors appointed shortly after the ACLU‟s September 28, 2011 report on deputy-on-\ninmate abuse.28  In particular, the use of unnecessary and dangerous force as \ndemonstrated by the prevalence of head strikes and severe head injuries supports the \nfollowing key findings of the Commission: \n  LASD personnel have used force against inmates disproportionate to the threat \nposed or when there was no threat at all; \n  LASD does not have a comprehensive, integrated and understandable use of force \npolicy; \n  A “force first” approach has been used as a means of discipline and to establish \nauthority rather than a last-resort response to assaultive behavior; \n                                                        \n24 Martin Decl. ¶ 24. \n25 Id. \n26 Id. \n27 Martin Decl. ¶ 25. \n28 See footnote 8, above \n10 \n \nPage 14\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 79-1   Filed 09/28/12   Page 13 of 13   Page ID\n #:1744\n  LASD training for custody is far below both industry best practices and training \nstandards in other correction systems; \n  There is substantial evidence of failures in reporting, investigating and \ndisciplining use of force in the jails; and \n  The miniscule number of unreasonable force findings casts doubt on the integrity \nof the investigatory process.29 \n \n                                                        \n29 Findings available at http://ccjv.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CCJV-\n090712-Exhibits.pdf. \n11 \n \nPage 15",

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the \"Rosas\" case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the \"Panel\") will \"prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n[developed by the Panel] ('Reports') at intervals the Panel shall determine.\"  This Report sets \nforth the Panel's assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from January 1, 2019, through June 30, 2019 (the \"Sixth \nReporting Period\"), and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas case.  In \naccordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement, it takes into consideration comments \nreceived from the Parties on November 20, 2019,1 regarding the draft of the report that was sent \nto them on October 29, 2019.     \n   \n  In May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel \"to develop a corrective action plan ('Action \nPlan') designed to ensure that [inmates] are not subject to excessive force in the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles\" (the \"Downtown Jail Complex\").  The plan developed by the Panel sets \nforth provisions in twenty-one areas that the Sheriff is required to implement in the Downtown \nJail Complex.  The plan was approved by the Court on April 7, 2016.  Under Paragraph VIII of \nthe Settlement Agreement, \"[w]hen the Panel certifies that any recommendation of the Action \nPlan has been implemented, it shall commence a period of monitoring the Defendant's \ncompliance with respect to that recommendation ('Compliance Period').\"   \n \n  As of November 1, 2018, the Sheriff's Department has implemented 104 of the Panel's \n106 recommendations.  The remaining two recommendations, Section 4.10 (expansion of \nconflict resolution training) and Section 9.1 (security checks), have been superseded by the \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in United States v. County of Los \nAngeles, et al., CV No. 15-05903 (JEMx) (the \"DOJ case\").2   \n \n  The Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex during the Sixth Reporting Period on \nFebruary 21-22, 2019, and again on April 29-30, 2019.  As in the past, the Panel spoke \ninformally with inmates and Department personnel while touring the jails.  The Panel debriefed \nthe Custody leadership on the Panel's observations of conditions in the jails, and the issues raised \nby inmates during the interviews.  The Panel also interviewed inmates identified by Plaintiffs \nregarding force incidents and grievances involving these inmates.    \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs' November 20, 2019 Letter reiterates many of their prior concerns regarding \naccess to video footage, redactions in documents provided to Class Counsel, the Panel's use of its \nRevised Compliance Measures to assess the Department's Compliance, and the Panel's reliance \non the Department's self-assessments.  See Plaintiff's Letter, pp. 1, n. 2, pp. 3-4, 5.  The Panel \naddressed these concerns in its Fifth Report, see pp. 3, 5, 13, and will not repeat its responses \nhere, except to note that the Panel encourages the County to provide Class Counsel with the \nsame camera angles and information in the force packages provided to the Panel.   \n2 The other recommendations in the Rosas Action Plan have been implemented in the \nother jail facilities outside of the Downtown Jail Complex pursuant to Paragraph 81 of \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the DOJ case. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 4 of 27   Page ID #:4241\n \n \n  As noted in the Panel's Fifth Report, on February 22, 2019, the Panel met with Sheriff \nAlex Villanueva to discuss his vision for the Department, the Panel's monitoring activities, and \nthe importance of the Sheriff's role in ensuring that the reforms instituted by the Department \ncontinue and Department personnel are held accountable for their conduct. The Panel again met \nwith Sheriff Villanueva on October 21, 2019 for an update on Custody Operations after he had \nbeen in office for over 10 months.   \n \n  On April 8, 2019, the Panel expressed its concerns in writing to Sheriff Villanueva \nregarding the reinstatement of former Deputies who had been terminated for misconduct.  \nAccording to published reports, soon after Sheriff Villanueva took office in December 2018, the \nDepartment attempted to reinstate \"two deputies [who had been] fired for misconduct – one \naccused of assaulting and harassing a woman and lying about it, the other for using unreasonable \nforce during an arrest.\"  (Los Angeles Times, \"L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva Reinstates \nFour More Fired Deputies,\" April 5, 2019.)  The Department attempted to reinstate the Deputy \naccused of dishonesty, notwithstanding that his termination had been upheld by the Civil Service \nCommission.  As the Panel advised the Sheriff, the reinstatement of Deputies who engaged in \nacts of dishonesty or excessive force is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Citizens' \nCommission on Jail Violence (\"CCJV\") and the provisions in the Action Plan that were \npromulgated to further implement CCJV's recommendations.3   \n  During the Sixth Reporting Period, the Interim Inspector General reported \"a sharp \nincrease in the number of administrative investigations that the Department was inactivating.\"  \n(Office of Inspector General, \"Report-Back on LASD Internal Administrative Investigations and \nDispositions of Disciplinary Actions,\" April 11, 2019, p. 2.)4  At the same time, there was a \n\"marked decrease\" in the number of administrative investigations in the First Quarter of 2019 as \ncompared to the same time period in prior years.  (Id., p. 3, n. 4.)  A subsequent report of the \nInspector General noted that the \"number of inactivated cases has since decreased [in the months \nof March through May 2019] and is more in line with past administrations.\"5 (Office of Inspector \nGeneral, \"Report-Back on LASD Internal Administrative Investigations and Dispositions of \nDisciplinary Actions for March, April and May 2019,\" July 22, 2019, p. 1.)  That report also \nnotes, however, that \"the Department has reduced the number of administrative investigations it \ninitiates.  Based on information provided by the Department, the number of administrative \ninvestigations initiated from January through May 2019 is the lowest at any time during the last \nten years, a period that spans the administrations of [the last three] sheriffs[.]\"  (Id.) \n \n  The Panel met with the Department's Inmate Grievance Coordinator during both of the \nPanel's site visits in the Sixth Reporting Period to discuss the Department's implementation of its \nnew grievance policies and procedures, and review the Inmate Grievance Coordinator's reports to \n                                                 \n3 Neither of the deputies were members of the Department's Custody Division at the time \nof the underlying misconduct or when they were fired for their misconduct.   \n4 See Panel's Fifth Report, p. 5.   \n5 This is likely because most of the inactivated investigations in December 2018 through \nFebruary 2019 were initiated under former Sheriff Jim McDonnell and because there was the \n\"marked decrease\" in the number of administrative investigations initiated in the First Quarter of \n2019.  With fewer investigations, there were fewer to inactivate.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 5 of 27   Page ID #:4242\n \nCustody commanders.  As in the past, the Panel was impressed with the progress the Department \ncontinues to make in its handling of inmate grievances and requests.   \n \n  During the Sixth Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 50 completed force packages that \nwere selected by the Panel from a comprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the \nDepartment.  The Panel also reviewed additional force packages involving cell extractions to \nensure that all of the force provisions of the Action Plan were reviewed during the Sixth \nReporting Period.  The packages were selected without input from the Department.6  After \nreviewing the completed force packages, the Panel met with Custody Commanders to discuss the \nforce incidents that were of concern to the Panel.  The reporting of the force, the supervisors' \ninvestigations, and the Commanders' reviews were also discussed in these meetings.  The Panel \nalso received a letter from Class Counsel regarding the force packages reviewed by the Panel in \nthe First Quarter of 2019, and met with Class Counsel to review issues they had identified in the \nforce packages reviewed by the Panel in the Second Quarter of 2019.  The Panel's analysis of \nthese packages set forth in this Report reflects the input from both the Custody Commanders and \nClass Counsel. \n \n     Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Department provides the Panel with self-\nassessments of its compliance with the non-force related provisions in the Action Plan.  The \nDepartment submitted its Sixth Self-Assessment Status Report (the \"Sixth Self-Assessment\") on \nSeptember 16, 2019, and augmented its self-assessment (the \"Augmented Sixth Self-\nAssessment\") on October 10, 2019.  During the Sixth Reporting Period, the Panel randomly \nselected and reviewed records posted by the Department to verify the Department's self-\nassessments of its compliance with non-force provisions of the Action Plan.  All of the \nDepartment's training results are subject to verification by auditors retained by the Panel.  \n \n  As has been the case since the beginning of the Initial Reporting Period, the \nDepartment cooperated fully with the Panel during the Sixth Reporting Period.  The Department \nand County Counsel facilitated our visits and inmate interviews, answered our questions, \nresponded to our requests for documents and information, and provided status reports regarding \nthe implementation of the grievance policies and the Early Warning System known as the \nEmployee Review System (\"ERS\").  They also engaged in constructive conversations with the \nPanel about our findings regarding the use of force incidents we had reviewed and the \nDepartment's continuing efforts to implement the terms of the Rosas Action Plan.  We appreciate \ntheir responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, and courtesy in handling our monitoring \nrequests.  Plaintiffs' counsel also has been fully cooperative with the Panel by identifying \ninmates for the Panel to interview and facilitating those interviews; reviewing and commenting \non the Department's use of force packages; and raising and discussing issues relating to the \nPanel's monitoring of the Department's compliance with the Action Plan.      \n                                                 \n6 Most of the force incidents reviewed by the Panel in the Sixth Reporting Period \noccurred during the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 6 of 27   Page ID #:4243\n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n  In the Panel's Fifth Report, we again noted the positive changes in the staff culture, and \nwe reported that we did not observe anything in our November 2018 site visit that caused  \nconcerns regarding the staff culture or changed patterns of use of force by Department members.  \nDuring the Panel's October 21, 2019 meeting with Sheriff Villanueva, he acknowledged the \nimportance of avoiding the use of force and using force only as a last resort. \n \n  During the Sixth Reporting Period, the Panel interviewed two inmates identified by Class \nCounsel about troubling force incidents in 2018, which are discussed below.  We did not, \nhowever, hear complaints about excessive force in informal conversations with other inmates \nduring our site visits in February and April 2019 following the election of Sheriff Villanueva.  \nAs in the past, the inmates consistently told us that excessive force was not an issue and \nconditions were much better than when they previously had been incarcerated in the County \nJails.   \n \n  In the Panel's Fifth Report, we noted a reduction in the number of force incidents in the \nsecond half of 2018 in the Downtown Jail Complex, where there was an average of 117 force \nincidents per month in comparison to an average of 144 incidents per month in the first six \nmonths of 2018.7  While the overall trend continued in the first half of 2019, with an average of \n115 force incidents per month in these facilities, the mix was different.  The number of Category \n2 force incidents increased from a total of 122 incidents in the second half of 2018 to 152 in the \nfirst half of 2019.8  At the same time, the number of minor \"non-categorical incidents\" (\"NCI's\")9 \ndecreased from a total of 193 to 113.  Excluding NCIs, there were 84 \"categorical\" force \nincidents10 per month in the Downtown Jail Complex in the second half of 2018 and 96 force \nincidents per month in the first half of 2019, which is a 14.3% increase.11  Although the number \nof categorical force incidents in the first half of 2019 is similar to the number of such incidents in \nthe first half of 2018,12 on an annualized basis there is a 10% increase in the number of Category \n2 incidents in 2019 and a 4.9% increase in the total number of categorical force incidents.13  To \n                                                 \n7 See Panel's Fifth Report, p. 10.  These figures are based upon statistics provided by the \nDepartment. \n8 Category 2 force encompasses most incidents with an \"identifiable injury,\" including \nrelatively minor injuries such as a cut or a bruise.  Force that is likely to, or does, result in severe \ninjuries is classified as a Category 3 incident.  Fortunately, there have been very few Category 3 \nforce incidents (under 0.2% of all force incidents) since the Court approved the Rosas Action \nPlan in 2016.   \n9 \"Non-categorical incidents\" (\"NCI\") are minor uses of force that are used to control \ninmates, are captured on video, and do not result in injuries or complaints of pain. \n10 \"Categorical\" force incidents are those incidents classified as Category 1, 2, or 3.   \n11 Most of this increase was in the First Quarter of 2019.  There was a 6.4% decrease in \nthe number of categorical force incidents in the Second Quarter of 2019.   \n12 There was an average of 99 categorical force incidents per month in the Downtown Jail \nComplex in the first half of 2018. \n13 This is because of the significant decrease in categorical force incidents in the second \nhalf of 2018 to 85.5 incidents per month in the Downtown Jail Complex. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 7 of 27   Page ID #:4244\n \nthe Department’s credit, the most serious Category 3 force incidents have been, and continue to \nbe, so infrequent that trends over time are not meaningful. \n \n  In addition to the use of force statistics, the Department provided the Panel with reports \nof \"prevented use of force\" incidents for the Downtown Jail Facilities that identify the \nDepartment members who were able to avoid or prevent the use of force.  There were a total of \n4,800 reported \"prevented use of force\" incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex in 2018 as \ncompared to a total of 1,565 reported uses of force, and 2,721 prevented use of force incidents in \nthe first half of 2019 as compared to 693 uses of force in these facilities.  These reports reflect \nthat the Department is able to avoid the use of force in the overwhelming majority of court-\nordered cell extractions and transfers of inmates to the Pitchess Detention Center in the northern \npart of the County, circumstances in which the potential need to use force is always present.  \nThey also reflect specific instances in which the Department members used DeVRT or verbal \ncommands to induce recalcitrant inmates to exit their cells (for medical or mental health \nservices) or return to their cells (after court appearances or receiving such services) or to quell \ndisturbances or break up fights among inmates.  That the Department is tracking this information \nreflects the importance it places on its members avoiding the use of force whenever possible.     \n \n  As in the past, the Panel interviewed inmates who complained to Class Counsel about \nexcessive force and misconduct by Sheriff's Department personnel.  Following the interviews, \nthe Panel requested and reviewed grievances submitted by the inmates and the force packages for \nthe incidents.  One of the incidents was a Category 3 incident in which the inmate sustained an \norbital fracture as a result of fight with a Deputy.  There were contradictory accounts given by \nthe inmate and other inmate witnesses, on the one hand, and the Department personnel, on the \nother.  The Panel could not resolve these differing accounts or determine if the force was out of \npolicy because the fight occurred in a caged area between Deputy stations leading to rows of \ncells that did not have a camera.  After reviewing this incident, a member of the Panel worked \nwith the Department to identify other similar caged areas that lacked cameras and additional \nareas where cameras should be placed.  The Panel urges the County to install cameras in these \nareas at MCJ;14 this is even more important now that the County intends to continue to use MCJ \nfor the foreseeable future.  \n \n  The Panel cannot stress enough the importance of having cameras in all of the common \nareas of the County's jails.  The vast majority of the force incidents have been captured on CCTV \nvideos that are sufficiently clear to resolve contradictory accounts.  Further, the cameras deter \nassaults by inmates and excessive force by Department personnel.   \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  The recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that Custody \nbe headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the Sheriff be engaged \npersonally in the management of the jails, the Department's managers be held accountable for \n                                                 \n14 A second incident involved a chemical sprayed into a cell by a Deputy who believed an \ninmate was about to throw a liquid substance at him.  The Panel could not resolve the \ncontradictory accounts because there are no cameras in, or pointed into, individual cells. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 8 of 27   Page ID #:4245\n \nany failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly report to the \nBoard of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and on its compliance with the Action Plan.    \n \n  The Department has been in Compliance with Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the Action Plan \nsince well before January 1, 2017.15  Custody has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no \nother areas of responsibility since mid-2014.  It was under the direction of Assistant Sheriff \nRobert Olmsted during the entire Sixth Reporting Period.  During the Panel's meeting with the \nSheriff on October 21, 2019, we were advised that Assistant Sheriff Olmsted will be stepping \ndown in December 2019.  Consistent with CCJV's recommendations, the Panel strongly urges \nthe Sheriff to appoint \"an individual with experience in managing a large corrections facility or \nrunning a corrections department\" as the new Assistant Sheriff over Custody.   \n \n  On February 22, 2019, the Panel met with Sheriff Villanueva, and reviewed his oversight \nof the jail facilities and the Panel's findings and observations.  The Department has provided the \nPanel with a log of the frequent meetings that Sheriff Villanueva had with Assistant Sheriff \nOlmsted from January 1, 2019, through June 30, 2019, to review use of force data and trends, \nsuicide attempts and rescue force, deployment of chemical agents and personal weapons, facility \nsecurity concerns, assaults on staff, use of force against mentally ill inmates, and de-escalation \ntechniques.  When the Panel met with the Sheriff on October 21, 2019, he stated that he regularly \nmeets with Custody personnel during tours of the jails, and he acknowledged the importance of \nconveying to them that force must only be used as a last resort. \n \n  In the First Quarter of 2019, there were two founded dispositions for violations of the \nDepartment's use of force policies in the Downtown Jail Complex, which resulted in one \nsuspension and one written reprimand.  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, there was a \n66.7% increase in force incidents at IRC, a 63.6% increase at MCJ, and a 1.6% increase at TTCF \nin the First Quarter of 2019.  Although the percentage increases are concerning, there was a \ndramatic decrease in the number of force incidents in IRC and MCJ from the Third Quarter to \nthe Fourth Quarter of 2018, and the number of force incidents at IRC in the First Quarter of 2019 \nwas the same as in the Third Quarter of 2018.  Overall, there was a 30.7% increase in the number \nof categorical force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex in the First Quarter of 2019.   \n \n  The IRC Unit Commander explained that there was a \"mass changeover in supervision\" \nand \"an increase of over 8,000 new bookings\" in the First Quarter of 2019.  The MCJ Unit \nCommander explained that \"MCJ has implemented new practices to mitigate, manage and reduce \nthe probability of force incidents from re-occurring,\" including orientation for new personnel by \nthe MCJ Compliance Team and additional supervision during inmate movement. \n                                                 \n15 Use of the term Compliance in bold is a finding of Compliance as of a certain date.  \nThe Panel's findings are set forth on the Appendix attached hereto.  For other provisions, the \nDepartment has either not achieved Compliance or is no longer in Compliance during this \ncurrent reporting period.  Based upon the Panel's findings, the parties will determine whether the \nSettlement Agreement is subject to termination pursuant to Section VIII of the agreement.  As \nnoted in the Panel's prior reports, the Panel encourages the \"Parties to adopt a meaningful and \nachievable framework to determine the Department's compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement\" in the future.    \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 9 of 27   Page ID #:4246\n \n \n  There were two founded dispositions for violations of the Department's use of force \npolicies in the Second Quarter of 2019, which resulted in written reprimands.  One of the force \nincidents occurred in November 2014, but the investigation was not completed until 2019 \nbecause one of the accused members, a Custody Assistant who had failed to report a use of force \nhe witnessed, was on military leave for much of 2016 through 2019.  The Custody Assistant \nreceived a written reprimand that was reduced from a proposed five day suspension.  The other \nfive Department members involved in that same incident received suspensions that were imposed \nin 2017.  In light of the decrease in the number of Internal Affairs Bureau investigations noted by \nthe Inspector General, see p. 2, supra, and the discipline imposed on the other Department \nmembers in this case, the decision to reduce the discipline imposed on the Custody Assistant \nmay reflect a relaxation of the Department's disciplinary standards that is of concern to the Panel. \n   \n  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, in the Second Quarter of 2019 there was a \n25.4% decrease in the number of force incidents at TTCF and a 7.4% decrease at MCJ, but there \nwas a 32% increase in the number of force incidents in IRC. There were no significant increases \nin Category 3 incidents in that quarter (there was only one incident, which was at MCJ).   \n \n  The IRC Unit Commander explained that the \"increase in uses of force [in IRC] has been \nprimarily attributed to the lack of a force review team, which has created a large administrative \nburden on line supervis[ors]. . . [who] have been spending a significant portion of their shift \nworking on administrative tasks and not in the deputy work stations.\"16  He reported an increase \nby over 1,000 new bookings as compared to the Second Quarter of 2018, which \"caused \nlogistical challenges\" that increased the \"risk that inmates with mental health and/or behavior \nissues may decompensate or act out in frustration because of the delay, increasing the likelihood \nof a use of force.\"  He reported that \"IRC has reassigned one (1) sergeant to the force review \nteam\" to address this problem, which \"should free the line supervisors to work directly with \npersonnel under their supervision more frequently.\"  An area Commander \"concur[red]\" with \nthese \"findings and recommendations,\" which were approved by a Custody Division Chief. \n \n  As reflected in the significant decrease in the number of categorical force incidents at \nMCJ in the Second Quarter of 2019, the Panel believes that the MCJ Unit Commander took steps \nto address the spike in force incidents in the First Quarter of 2019, although the number of force \nincidents in the Second Quarter of 2019 (100) is still significantly higher than the number of \nincidents during the Third Quarter (83) and the Fourth Quarter of 2018 (66).17  The Panel is, \n                                                 \n16 In the Panel's meeting with the Sheriff on October 21, 2019, he indicated that the \nDepartment does not have enough sergeants to provide both the necessary first line supervision \nand timely complete unit level investigations of force incidents.  Without commenting on budget \nor funding issues, the Panel observes that additional Sergeants would facilitate the Department's \nability to perform both of these functions, which are essential to ensure that Department \nmembers adhere to the use of force provisions in the Action Plan.   \n17 The Panel disagrees with Plaintiffs' assertion that this is inconsistent with the Panel's \nfindings regarding the Department's Compliance with Sections 13.1 and 13.2.  See Plaintiffs \nLetter, p. 6.  The Panel does not believe the a Unit Commander's failure to report why a member \nwho was placed on a Unit Performance Mentoring Program was not terminated or to advise the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 10 of 27   Page ID\n#:4247\n \nhowever, concerned about the increases at IRC over the first two quarters of 2019,18 and \nquestions whether re-assigning one Sergeant is sufficient to address these increases.  The \nDepartment reports that in the First and Second Quarters of 2019 it achieved Compliance with \nSection 1.3, which requires Unit Commanders to address use of force problems in their facilities. \nThe Panel is of the view, however, that this finding should be limited to TTCF and MCJ. \n \n  Plaintiffs identified four force packages that they assert reflect dishonest conduct by \nDepartment employees who were not punished by supervisors for \"such dishonesty.\"  See \nPlaintiffs' Letter, p. 7.  They \"infer dishonesty from severe discrepancies between a LASD \nemployee's description of a use of force incident and the video of the incident.\"  Id.  The Panel \nagrees with the Plaintiffs' assessment of one of the force incidents, but does not agree with \nPlaintiffs' conclusions that there is \"brazen inaccuracy\" in the other force packages.  The Panel \ndoes not disagree, however, that the Department must \"vigorously police\" any inaccurate force \nreports and the Panel \"must meticulously review force packages and other documents submitted \nby [the Department] for indices of dishonesty.\"  Id. \n \n  The Department is in Compliance with Section 1.4.  The Assistant Sheriff for Custody \nOperations under Sheriff McDonnell reported on the Department's use of force in the jails and its \nimplementation of the Rosas Settlement Agreement to the Board of Supervisors on June 12, \n2018.  Because Sheriff Alex Villanueva assumed office on December 3, 2018, the Panel agreed \nthat the presentation to the Board scheduled for December 11, 2018 could be continued to \nJanuary 2019.  The Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations and a Commander in Custody made \na presentation to the Board on January 15, 2019.  The Department provided the Panel with a \ncopy of the transcript of the Department's presentation on that date.  After multiple continuances \nthat were not always within the Department's control, on September 10, 2019, a Commander in \nCustody Operations and the Unit Commander responsible for the Custody Compliance and \nSustainability Bureau (\"CCSB\") made a presentation to the Board of Supervisors on the \nDepartment's Compliance with the Rosas Action Plan through the First Quarter of 2019.19  One \nof the Panel's members attended the Department's presentation to the Board and responded to \nquestions from the Supervisors.  In order to maintain Compliance with Section 1.4, the \nDepartment needs to make another report to the Board no later than the First Quarter of 2020 on \nits Compliance through the Third Quarter of 2019 and every six months thereafter.   \n \n  Sections 10.1 and 10.2 require the Department's leadership to tour each of the jail \nfacilities and document those visits.  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that it  \nmaintained Compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 as of June 30, 2018, through June 30, 2019.  \n                                                 \nInspector General means that the Commander failed to address the increase in the number of \nforce incidents at MCJ.     \n18 From 39 incidents in the Fourth Quarter of 2018 to 86 incidents in the Second Quarter \nof 2019.  Going back further, there were 65 incidents in the Third Quarter of 2018.  Taking an \naverage of 52 force incidents per quarter, the 86 force incidents represents a 65% increase in \nforce incidents since the last reporting period. \n19 Although the Commander was an articulate and well-prepared spokesperson for the \nDepartment, no one from senior leadership in the Custody Division was present to answer the \nBoard's questions.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 11 of 27   Page ID\n#:4248\n \nThe Sheriff and Assistant Sheriff visited the jail facilities as required by Section 10.1, as did the \nCaptains, Commanders, and Chiefs.20  The Department documented these visits, along with visits \nby Watch Commanders, as required by Section 10.2.  The Panel has reviewed the source \ndocuments provided by the Department and verified the results reported by the Department. \n \n  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require the Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotation \npolicies and rotate personnel as required by the policies, and (2) audit each unit’s compliance \nwith its rotation policies.  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports 99% Compliance \nwith Section 18.1, and 99% Compliance with Section 18.2 in the Sixth Reporting Period. The \nPanel has reviewed the source documents provided by the Department and verified the results \nreported by the Department.  Unit Commanders are rotating non-exempt personnel found to be \n\"out of Compliance\" in audits of the unit's compliance with its rotations policies.21  \n   \n  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that it maintained 100% Compliance \nwith Section 21.1 as of June 30, 2018, through June 30, 2019.  The Panel has reviewed the \nsource documents provided by the Department, which reflect that no member was transferred or \nassigned to Custody as a sanction for problematic conduct.   \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 of the Action Plan requires the Department to \"have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]\"  On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.  The Department's Custody Force Manual satisfies Section 2.1 and includes specific \nprovisions that satisfy Sections 8.2 (Complaints of Retaliation), 17.2 (Pregnant Inmates), 20.1 \n(Types of Force), and 20.2 (Definition of Reactive Force) of the Action Plan.  The Department \nhas been in Compliance with these Sections since the Panel began monitoring the Department's \ncompliance as of January 1, 2017. \n \n  The other recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department's use of \nforce in Custody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Sections 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n                                                 \n20 Where there is more than one Unit Commander or Commander for a facility, the \nDepartment's posted audit results combine the tours by all of assigned commanders for that \nfacility.   \n21 The Department's posted audit results reflect that one Deputy who has been in a 36-\nmonth rotation position in IRC for 72 months has been out on leave and a second Deputy in the \nposition for 44 months was moved \"following previous audit findings.\"  The other Deputies who \nhad been in their positions for upwards of 79 to 98 months, see Panel's Fifth Report, p. 8, n. 11, \nwere rotated out during the Fifth Reporting Period.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 12 of 27   Page ID\n#:4249\n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate's medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Section 20.3 requires the Department to adopt use of force policies for Planned Force \n(such as cell extractions). \n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department's policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  The Department has made some changes and/or additions to the policies that were \napproved by the Panel in 2015.  Some of the changes were reviewed by the Monitor and the \nDepartment of Justice in the DOJ case, and reflect their comments in that case, but they were not \nreviewed by the entire Rosas Panel.  The Panel has compared the current version of the Custody \nDivision Manual, dated August 16, 2019, with the version dated October 15, 2015, that was \napproved by the Panel.  Although most of the changes are acceptable, the Panel has advised the \nDepartment that some modifications are necessary and recommended other modifications.22        \n     \n  Per the applicable Compliance Measures, the Panel selected 25 force incidents to review \nin the First Quarter of 2019 without any input from the Department.  As in the past, the universe \nof force incidents selected by the Panel includes a disproportionate number of the more serious \nCategory 2 incidents involving the use of personnel weapons (punches) by Department \npersonnel.  According to Use of Force statistics provided by the Department for the Sixth \nReporting Period, 82.2% of the force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex were either \nCategory 1 incidents or Non-Categorical incidents, and 17.7% were Category 2 incidents.  \n \n  To reduce the lag time between the occurrence of the force incidents and the completion \nof the force investigations, the Panel requested both completed and pending force investigations, \nwith the expectation that the Department would expedite the completion of the pending force \npackages before the end of the First Quarter of 2019.  The Department was able to complete all \nof the pending investigations requested by the Panel before the end of the First Quarter of 2019, \nand the Panel reviewed 25 completed force packages in that quarter.   \n \n  The Panel concluded that 22 of the 25 completed force packages reviewed in the First \nQuarter of 2019 were in Compliance with the use of force provisions of the Action Plan, which is \n                                                 \n22 The Panel appreciates that the Department has indicated that it will ensure that Rosas-\nrelated changes will be submitted to the Panel in the future and it is \"working to address\" the \nmodifications and recommendations \"referenced by the Panel.\" \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 13 of 27   Page ID\n#:4250\n \nslightly below the 90% \"vertical\" threshold for Compliance with the Action Plan.  The Panel also \nconcluded that the Department was not in compliance with the following specific provisions of \nthe Action Plan:  force prevention principles (Section 2.2), head strikes (Section 2.6), and the use \nof chemical weapons and Tasers (Section 2.12).23  As in the past, the Panel's main concern was \nthat Department members sometimes reacted too quickly and should have taken advantage of \n\"time and distance\" to de-escalate the situation and avoid using force altogether or to plan a \npotentially safer use of force.  The Panel reiterates its view that additional improvement can be \nachieved by the Department to avoid force altogether in some confrontational situations. \n \n  In the Second Quarter of 2019, the Panel again reviewed 25 force incidents, consisting of \na combination of investigations that were already completed and pending investigations that \nwere completed during the period.  The Panel concluded that 20 of the 25 packages reviewed \nwere in Compliance with the use of force provisions, and that the Department did not reach the \n90% \"vertical\" threshold for Compliance with the Action Plan.  The Panel also concluded that \nthe Department was not in compliance with the following provisions of the Action Plan:  force \nprevention principles (Section 2.2) and calling supervisors before handling recalcitrant inmates \n(Section 2.7).  The failure to call a supervisor when confronted with a recalcitrant inmate is a \nvariant on the need for Department members to take more time before using force to control a \nrecalcitrant inmate.   \n \n  The Panel also reviewed four cell extractions in the Second Quarter of 2019, to assess the \nDepartment's compliance with specific provisions that are applicable to the use of force in those \ncircumstances (e.g., checking medical records before using force (Section 2.13), consulting with \nMental Health Professionals (Section 4.1), Cooling Off periods (Section 4.4), Mental Health \nProvider's Order (Section 4. 5), and Planned uses of force protocols (Section 20.3)).  The Panel \ndid not find any issues with the minimal force used in the cell extractions and the Department \nfollowed all of the applicable protocols for use of force in those circumstances. \n \n  The Panel again reviewed the problematic incidents with Custody Commanders during \nthe Panel's site visits, and took into consideration their comments in reaching the conclusions set \nforth in this Report.  During the Panel’s meetings with Commanders, the Panel again \nrecommended that the Department use ankle restraints when moving high risk inmates to \nincrease safety for staff and other inmates. The Department's training bureau has undertaken to \nresearch these kinds of restraints.   \n \n  The Panel received a letter from Plaintiffs' counsel, dated May 13, 2019, setting forth \nPlaintiffs' comments and concerns regarding the force packages the Panel had reviewed in the \nFirst Quarter of 2019.  The Panel also met with Plaintiffs' counsel on October 1, 2019, to review \ntheir comments and concerns regarding the force packages the Panel had reviewed in the Second \nQuarter of 2019.  The Panel took into consideration Plaintiffs' comments and concerns in \nreaching the conclusions in this report.   \n \n                                                 \n23 The Panel also found that the Department was not in compliance with 20.3 pertaining \nto the planned use of force protocols, but the universe of cases was too small to generate \nmeaningful results.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 14 of 27   Page ID\n#:4251\n \n  It is perhaps not surprising that the parties have widely divergent views on whether the \nuse of force was appropriate in a number of cases, but the Panel has found the parties' input to \nhave been very helpful. \n   \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining on use of force policies and on ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with \nrespect; and that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody-specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based, skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and in \"identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.\"  Section 12.1 requires that Custody Sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.    \n \n  The Department's training results are subject to audit by the Panel's auditors.  All of the \nDepartment's reported results for the initial training of existing Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants and for new members set forth below have been verified by the Panel's auditors based \nupon reviews of Department rosters and training records.  The auditors verified that the \nDepartment's new members had received the required initial training from when it was first \noffered through the \"as of\" date reported by the Department for the completion of the initial \ntraining required for existing Deputies and Custody Assistants.  Accordingly, the Panel has \ndeemed the Department to be in Compliance \"as of\" the date reported by the Department for the \ncompletion of the initial training required for existing personnel.  Going forward, the \nDepartment's continuing Compliance with the training provisions will be based upon its \nCompliance with the refresher training required every year or every other year.   \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies and Custody Assistants in the \nDowntown Jail Complex had received the initial eight-hour use of force training required by \nSection 3.1.24  96% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required \nrefresher course through December 31, 2018.25  The refresher results for the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2018 have been verified by the Panel's auditors and the Department is in \nCompliance with Section 3.1 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The \nDepartment's Augmented Sixth Self-Assessment reports that its \"preliminary assessment results\" \nas of June 30, 2019, indicate that 90% of the Deputies and Custody Assistants completed the \nrequired use of force refresher course in the Sixth Reporting Period.  The final results will be \nsubject to verification by the Panel's auditors. \n \n                                                 \n24 The use of force training that was approved by the Panel includes the custody-based \nuse of force scenarios in Compliance with Section 3.4.  \n25 The Panel granted the Department extensions for Deputies who received the basic use \nof force training in 2017 and 2018 for completion of the initial refresher courses.  The Panel \nexpects Department personnel to complete future refresher courses before the end of December \nof the years in which they are required.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 15 of 27   Page ID\n#:4252\n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 95% of the existing personnel received the initial four-hour training \ncourse in ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with respect as required by Section 3.2.  \n95% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required refresher \ncourse through December 31, 2018.  The refresher results for the Third and Fourth Quarters of \n2018 have been verified by the Panel's auditors and the Department is in Compliance with \nSection 3.2 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Department's Augmented \nSixth Self-Assessment reports that its \"preliminary assessment results\" as of June 30, 2019 \nindicate that 96% of the Deputies and Custody Assistants completed the required ethics refresher \ncourse in the Sixth Reporting Period.  The final results will be subject to verification by the \nPanel's auditors. \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies at the Downtown Jail Complex and in \nthe mental health unit at the Century Regional Detention Facility (\"CRDF\") received the 32 \nhours of training on Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution Training (DeVRT), including the \neight hours of identifying and working with mentally ill inmates, required by Sections 4.6 and \n4.7.  Also as of that date, 98% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF, and all Deputies at the North \nCounty Correctional Facility (\"NCCF\"), and the Pitchess Detention Center (\"PDC\") jails \nreceived the eight hours training in identifying and working with mentally ill inmates required by \nSection 4.7.   \n \n  96% of the Deputies in the Downtown Jail Complex and the mental health unit at CRDF \nand 97% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF and the Deputies at the other facilities received the \nrequired refresher training for the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018. The refresher results have \nbeen verified and the Department is in Compliance with Section 4.6 and 4.7 as of June 30, 2018, \nthrough December 31, 2018.  The Department's Augmented Sixth Self-Assessment reports that \nits \"preliminary assessment results\" as of June 30, 2019 indicate that 98% of the Deputies and \nCustody Assistants the completed the refresher course required by Section 4.6 and 92% \ncompleted the refresher course required by Section 4.7 in the Sixth Reporting Period.  The final \nresults will be subject to verification by the Panel's auditors.  \n \n  The Department has reported since the First Reporting Period that, beginning on July 1, \n2015, newly assigned Deputies have been required to complete a six-week Custody Operations \ncourse that includes training in use of force and ethics, professionalism and treating inmates with \nrespect, and new Custody Assistants have received training in these subjects during their \nAcademy training.  The Department's posted audit results reflect that the Department has \nexceeded the 95% Compliance standard for new Deputies through May 2019 and for new \nCustody Assistants through June 2019.  These results have been verified by the Panel's auditors \nand the Department is in Compliance with Section 3.3 as of June 30, 2018 through June 30, \n2019.26 \n \n  The Department previously reported that 98% of new Deputies had received the approved \nconflict resolution training in the Academy and the Jail Continuum, and 100% of newly assigned \nCustody Assistants had received the conflict resolution training (DeVRT) and training in \n                                                 \n26  There were no Deputy graduations in March or June 2019 and no Custody Assistant \ngraduations in January through March 2019 or May 2019. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 16 of 27   Page ID\n#:4253\n \n\"identifying and working with mentally ill inmates\" required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June \n30, 2018.  The Department's posted audit results reflect that 100% of new Deputies received the \ntraining required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 in the First Quarter of 2019, and 98/100% of newly \nassigned Deputies27 and 100% Custody Assistants received the required training in the Second \nQuarter of 2019.  These results have been verified by the Panel's auditors and the Department is \nin Compliance with Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June 30, 2018 through June 30, 2019. \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 90.4% of the Sergeants \nassigned to Custody as of October 1, 2016, had received the 16 hours of training in conducting \nuse of force investigations required by Section 12.1.28  These results have been verified by the \nPanel's auditors. The Department's posted audit results report that 100% of the Sergeants newly \npromoted in Custody in the Second Quarter of 2019 received the required training.29  For the \nperiod October 1, 2016, through March 31, 2018, the Department’s posted results reflect partial \ncompliance.  The resulting cumulative compliance for newly promoted Sergeants through the \nSecond Quarter of 2019 falls under the 95% compliance standard.  These cumulative results are \nsubject to verification by the Panel's auditors once the Department achieves the 95% threshold.  \nThe Department's Augmented Sixth Self-Assessment reports that \"preliminary assessment \nresults\" as of June 30, 2019 indicate that 93% of the Sergeants who completed the initial training \nreceived the required training refresher course in the Sixth Reporting Period. The final results \nwill be subject to verification by the Panel's auditors.     \n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine \"what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it 'Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better;' direct that the \nDepartment member undergo such additional training, counseling, or mentoring; and document \nthe action taken.\"  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that there were no such cases \nin the First or Second Quarters of 2019.   \n   \n  Section 3.6 requires Unit Commanders to review new Department members within six \nmonths of being initially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary \nperiod.  Based upon a random selection of personnel records, the Department reports that 68% of \nthe new Department members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6 in the first six months of \n2019, which is below the 95% threshold for Compliance.    \n \n4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  Many of the recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are assessed by the \nPanel through a review of the completed force packages.  Other provisions are reported by the \nDepartment as follow:   \n \n                                                 \n27 98% in the April 2019 class and 100% in the May 2019 class. \n28 See Self-Assessment Status Report, September 2018, p. 13. \n29 There were no newly promoted Sergeants in the First Quarter of 2019. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 17 of 27   Page ID\n#:4254\n \n  Section 5.1 requires the Department to track use of force investigations, reviews, and \nevaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of \ndiscrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The Department reports that 94% of \nthe force incidents in the First Quarter of 2019 were timely entered into the database as \nrequired by Section 5.1, and 91% were timely entered in the Second Quarter of 2019, \nwhich is below the 95% threshold required for Compliance.   \n \n  Section 8.3 requires investigations of inmate grievances that Department members used \nforce to retaliate against inmates be timely evaluated by the Custody Force Review \nCommittee.  The Department reports that it did not achieve Compliance with this \nprovision in either the First or Second Quarters of 2019.  The Department reports that a \nCorrective Action Plan (\"CAP\") \"has been issued\" to \"improve. . .tracking and \nscheduling[.]\" \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents.  The \nCompliance Measure requires that \"95% of the investigations reviewed by CFRT were \nnot delayed beyond the period permitted by law for imposing discipline.\"  The \nDepartment previously reported that that it achieved Compliance with Section 11.1 in \nthe Second Quarter of 2018.  Because there were no use of force incidents reviewed by \nCFRT in which there was a finding of a policy violation or misconduct in either the Fifth \nor Sixth Reporting Periods, the predicate for determining compliance with Section 11.1 \ndid not exist in those periods.   \n \n  Section 13.1 requires the Department to \"have a firm policy of zero tolerance for acts of \ndishonesty or failure to report uses of force.\"  Section 13.1 and 13.2 require the \ndocumentation of the reasons and reports to the Inspector General whenever the \nDepartment does not terminate a member who has been found to have been dishonest, \nused excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act (\"PREA\").  The \nDepartment reports that there were no incidents in the First Quarter of 2019 that were \nsubject to Sections 13.1 and 13.2.30  In the Second Quarter of 2019, the Department \ndetermined that a Department member had failed to report a force incident that occurred \nin April 2018 and issued a written reprimand.  On September 17, 2019, a Captain in MCJ \napproved a recommendation that the member \"be placed on the Unit Performance \nMentoring Program.\"  The documents submitted by the Department do not, however, \nreflect \"the reasons why the member was not terminated\" as required by Section 13.1 or \nshow that a report was submitted to the Inspector General as required by Section 13.2.31        \n                                                 \n30 As the Panel previously stated, it agrees with Plaintiffs that the Department \"cannot \nhave a policy of zero tolerance for dishonesty or failure to report if it terminates ongoing \ninvestigations of personnel alleged to have engaged in those forms of misconduct.\"  Plaintiffs' \nLetter, dated November 20, 2019, p. 3; see Panel's Fifth Report, p. 6.   \n31 As noted above, see pp. 6-7, supra, in the Second Quarter of 2019, the Department also \nfound that a second member had failed to report the use of force by another department member \nfour and a half years earlier in November 2014.  The investigation was not completed until the \nSecond Quarter of 2019 because the member who failed to report the force was on Military \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 18 of 27   Page ID\n#:4255\n \n \n  Sections 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of inmates for \ncriminal prosecution arising from incidents involving the use of force by Department \nmembers and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of \"officer misconduct that may \namount to criminal violations.\"  The Department reports 100% in Compliance with \nSection 14.1 in the First Quarter of 2019, and 96% in the Second Quarter of 2019.  With \nrespect to Section 14.2, there was one timely criminal referral to the District Attorney 14 \ndays after the Department learned of the incident in the First Quarter of 2019, and \"no \nreferrals of a Department member for possible prosecution for alleged misconduct that \nmay amount to a criminal violation for the 2nd Quarter, 2019.\"  Accordingly, the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 14.2 as of the Third Quarter of 2018, through \nthe Second Quarter of 2019.   \n   \n  The Panel reviewed 25 completed force packages in the First Quarter of 2019 to assess \ncompliance with the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the reporting and investigation of \nforce incidents.  The Panel concluded that 22 out of the 25 (or 88%) were in Compliance with \nthese provisions, which was below the 90% \"vertical\" threshold for Compliance.  The Panel \nconcluded that the Department was not in compliance with the provision regarding the \nCommanders' reviews (Section 5.2) and the reporting of the observation of visible injuries or the \nlack of such injuries (Section 15.4).  In addition, the information provided by the Department \nwas often not sufficient for the Panel to determine the Department's compliance with the \nprovision relating to the separation of Department personnel after a force incident (Section 15.6).     \n \n  The Panel concluded that 21 of the 25 (or 84%) completed force packages reviewed in \nthe Second Quarter of 2019 were in Compliance, which is below the 90% \"vertical\" threshold for \nCompliance.  The Panel concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the provision \nregarding the location of inmate interviews (Section 12.2) and the reporting of visible injuries \n(Section 15.4).  In addition, the information provided by the Department was not, in many cases, \nsufficient for the Panel to determine the Department's compliance with the provision relating to  \nthe separation of Department personnel after a force incident (Section 15.6).     \n   \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  The Action Plan requires extensive changes in how the Department handles inmate \ngrievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016, the Department issued a new \"Inmate \nGrievance Manual\" (Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual) to implement a new grievance \nsystem.  The Panel assessed the Department's implementation of the new grievance system as \nfollows: \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.6 require that separate forms for inmate grievances be reasonably \navailable to inmates and that the forms have specific check boxes.  Section 7.1 requires the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the \nDepartment’s Conflict Resolution Policy.  Based upon site visits during the Sixth Reporting \n                                                 \nLeave.  He received a written reprimand, but has not been placed on a performance mentoring \nplan because he is currently on active duty in the Army.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 19 of 27   Page ID\n#:4256\n \nPeriod, the Panel concluded that the forms meeting these requirements of the Action Plan are \nreasonably available to inmates, and the Department remains in Compliance with those \nprovisions relating to the availability of the required forms.   \n \n  The Department is required to establish that use of force grievances (Section 6.4) and \nretaliation grievances (Section 6.5) against staff are brought to the attention of Unit Commanders \nwithin 10 days and properly handled.  Based upon a review of the relevant grievances in the \nrandomly selected month, the Department reports that 83% of the use of force grievances were in \nCompliance with Section 6.4 in the First Quarter of 2019, which is below the 90% threshold for \nCompliance and 92% were in Compliance in the Second Quarter of 2019, which exceeds the \nthreshold for Compliance.  The Department also reports that 97% of the retaliation grievances \nwere in Compliance with Section 6.5 in the First Quarter of 2019 and 100% in the Second \nQuarter of 2019.  The source documents posted by the Department for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 have \nbeen reviewed by the Panel, which verified that these grievances were handled appropriately.       \n \n  Sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the Action Plan set forth specific requirements for the \ndetermination, handling, and notifications of non-medical emergencies.  Based upon the \nselection and review of the grievances marked \"emergency\" in the month randomly selected by \nthe Panel, the Department reports \"there were no grievances that met the criteria of Provision 6.7 \nduring the randomly selected months. . . . All 50 grievances in each quarter were downgraded per \nCustody Division policy and assessed in Provision 6.8.\"  The Department reports 100% \nCompliance with Section 6.8 for the First Quarter of 2019, and 99% Compliance in the Second \nQuarter of 2019.  The source documents posted by the Department for Sections 6.7 and 6.8 have \nbeen reviewed by the Panel, which verified that it was appropriate to deem these grievances as \nnon-emergent.  As in the past, the Department handled non-emergent grievances expeditiously as \nrequired by the nature of the grievance. Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with \nthese provisions for the period July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019.   \n \n  Section 6.9 requires that emergency grievances be forwarded to the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator.  Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 require the Inmate Grievance Coordinator to track the \nDepartment's handling of inmate grievances, provide a monthly report to the Unit Commander \nand senior management in Custody on the status of inmate grievances, and analyze inmate \ngrievances for problematic trends.  The Panel met with the Department's Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator during both site visits in the Sixth Reporting Period to review the Department's \nimplementation of the new grievance system and the reports generated for the Department's \nmanagers.  The Department provided documentation to the Panel showing that for the First and \nSecond Quarters of 2019, the Inmate Grievance Coordinator received the information about \nemergency grievances required by Section 6.9 and prepared detailed reports for managers as \nrequired by Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 6.9, \n6.13, 6.14, and 6.15, as of July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019.  \n \n  Sections 6.10 and 6.12 require that grievances be collected daily, logged in, and tracked \nin an inmate grievance database.  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that 98% of \nthe grievances were collected and reviewed with 24 hours in the First Quarter of 2019 and 96% \nin the Second Quarter of 2019.  The source documents for these results posted by the Department \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 20 of 27   Page ID\n#:4257\n \nwere reviewed by the Panel and support the Department's reported findings.  Accordingly, the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 6.10 as of January 1, 2019, through June 30, 2019. \n \n  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that 98% of the grievances in the \nrandomly selected months in the First Quarter of 2019 were entered into the database and \nhandled as required by Section 6.12, and 100% of the grievances were entered and tracked in the \ndatabase in the Second Quarter of 2019.  Again, the source documents for these results were \navailable to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with \nSection 6.12 as of the July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019.     \n \n  Section 6.11 requires that the Custody Division Manual provide that failing to comply \nwith Department policies requiring proper handling of inmate grievances may be cause for \ndiscipline.  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that \"[n]o Department members \nwere found to have violated the grievance policy during the [Sixth] reporting period.\" \n \n  Sections 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, and 7.2 set forth the deadlines for filing use of force and \nPREA grievances,32 the Department's initial responses, inmates' right to appeal, and the \nDepartment's notifications of the results of the investigations.  The Department's Sixth Self-\nAssessment reports that it adhered to the deadlines for these grievances in both the First and \nSecond Quarters of 2019.  It also reports that it adhered to the deadlines for advising inmates of \nthe results of adjudications as required by Section 7.2 for the First Quarter of 2019, but not the \nSecond Quarter of 2019.  The posted source documents for these results were reviewed by the \nPanel and support the Department's reported findings. The Panel agrees that the Department is in \nCompliance with Sections 6.18 and 6.20 as of July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019.   \n \n  The Department's Self-Assessment reports it was in Compliance with Section 6.19 in the \nSecond Quarter of 2019 because it responded to 92% of grievances against staff and 96% of \ngrievances not against staff within 15 days.  At the time that the Panel developed the Action \nPlan, the Medical Services Bureau was part of the Sheriff's Department and subject to the \nfifteen-day notification requirement in Section 6.19.  Although medical is now part of \nCorrectional Health Services within the Department of Health Services, it must still respond to \ninmate grievances against the medical staff  (e.g., lack of a timely response to a request for \nmedical services) within 15 days, and report its compliance with this requirement to the Panel.    \n \n  As previously reported, the Panel believes that the decentralized grievance system \ndeveloped by the Department under the direction of an Inmate Grievance Coordinator is \neffectively and efficiently handling inmate grievances and requests for service and that the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 6.16.33 \n \n                                                 \n32 Section 6.18 provides that there is no deadline for filing PREA grievances.   \n33 The Plaintiffs again assert that the Panel has \"overstepped the bounds of [its] authority.  \nSee Plaintiffs' Letter, p. 8.  As the Panel previously reported, it \"believes that the current system \nis consistent with the intention of the Panel in drafting Section 6.16 as it 'is effectively and \nefficiently handling inmate grievances and requests for service.'\"  See Panel's Fifth Report, p. 20.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 21 of 27   Page ID\n#:4258\n \n  Section 7.3 requires the Department to \"ensure that there are adequate avenues for \nconstructive prisoner-staff communication[.]\"  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports \nthat the Department was in Compliance with Section 7.3 during both the First and Second \nQuarters of 2019.  The Department provided logs of Town Hall meetings at MCJ and TTCF \nduring the randomly selected months of March and April 2019.  Per Compliance Measure 7.3-1, \nthe Town Hall assessments are limited to the General Population housing units, and the logs \nprovided by the Department for those housing units reflect that relatively few General Population \ninmates attended the meetings.  The logs provided for the Second Quarter of 2019 reflect, \nhowever, that there were Town Hall meetings in special housing units (discipline/administrative \nsegregation, mental health, and high security) and that more inmates attended the meetings in \nthese units.  Based upon these logs, the Panel is of the view that the Department has achieved \nCompliance with Section 7.3 in the Second Quarter of 2019, with the understanding that in the \nfuture the Department will provide logs for special units as well as general population units and \nTown Hall meeting reports for 10% of all the inmates who attended the Town Hall meetings. \n \n  The Monitors have long suggested converting, where possible, to direct supervision to \nenhance safety and security.  Implementation of the principles and practices of direct supervision \nwould help the Department remain in compliance with Section 7.3 as the program ensures direct \ncommunication between inmates and staff, 16 hours a day, seven days a week.  In addition, \nDeputies and Custody Assistants would be well-positioned to prevent inmate on inmate violence, \nand quickly call for backup and intervene when it occurs, among other well-documented \nadvantages.   \n \n  Section 8.1 prohibits Department personnel from retaliating against inmates.  The \nDepartment previously reported that it was in Compliance with Section 8.1 as of March 31, \n2018, through December 31, 2018.34  The Department posted the results of the investigations \napproved by Unit Commanders in the randomly selected months and the number of anti-\nretaliation grievances received and investigated in the First and Second Quarters of 2019.  It \nreports that there were no founded violations of the anti-retaliation policy in either quarter.  The \nPanel finds that the Department has maintained Compliance with Section 8.1 through June 30, \n2019. \n   \n  The Panel agrees with the Plaintiffs that it cannot \"rely exclusively on the results of \nLASD's self-reporting, without conducting any independent investigation on [its] own\" to \nestablish Compliance with Section 8.1.  See Plaintiffs' Letter, p. 4.  Plaintiffs erroneously state, \nhowever, that the Panel concluded that the Department \"maintained compliance with Section 8.1 \ndespite the fact that it did not review any supporting documents whatsoever.\"  Id., p. 8.  The \nPanel reviewed the investigative summaries that were posted by the Department of the anti-\nretaliation grievances that Unit Commanders deemed unfounded in the random months of March \nand April 2019.35 \n \n                                                 \n34  Discipline was imposed for the one founded grievance in the First Quarter of 2018 and \nfor the two founded grievances in the Second Quarter of 2018.  There were no founded \nviolations of the anti-retaliation policy in the Third or Fourth Quarters of 2018. \n35 The investigative summaries included reports of interviews of inmates and staff.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 22 of 27   Page ID\n#:4259\n \n  6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include \"a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints\" identified in this recommendation.  \nThe Department included such a separate section in the Manual, and is in Compliance with this \nrequirement of Section 17.1, effective December 1, 2015. \n   \n  Sections 17.1, 17.3, 17.4, and 17.6 through 17.9 (the \"Restraint Provisions\") of the \nAction Plan require the Department to provide the Panel \"with a list of incidents in which \ninmates were placed in a Safety Chair, restrained to a fixed object for more than 20 minutes, \nsubjected to security restraints for an extended length of time. . .or subjected to a multi-point \nrestraint in the Downtown Jail Complex[.]\"  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Panel \nis supposed to select and review 25 incidents involving Security Restraints from the \nDepartment's list to assess the Department's compliance with the security restraint provisions.   \n \n  During the Sixth Reporting Period, the Department generated a list of incidents involving \nthe use of a Safety Chair and Fixed Restraints in the Downtown Jail Complex in the First Quarter \nof 2019, and provided the Inmate Safety Chair Security Check Logs for use of the safety chair at \nTTCF and IRC in the First and Second Quarters of 2019.  The Department also provided Safety \nCheck Logs for at least some of the safety chair uses at MCJ in the Second Quarter of 2019.  \nThere were no logs for the use of fixed restraints in areas not under direct observation of \nDepartment members.   \n \n  The Panel does not believe that it needs to review force packages to assess the \nDepartment's compliance with the Restraint Provisions of the Action Plan, but it does need a \ncomplete list of all uses of the safety chair and all uses of fixed restraints in areas not under \nconstant, direct observation, and security check logs showing that the inmates were checked at \nleast every 15 minutes and that medical professionals performed necessary vitals checks.    \n \n  In most instances, the safety chair is used at TTCF and IRC to transport mentally ill \ninmates to court without any uses of force. The Inmate Safety Chair Security Check Logs for the \ninmates at TTCF reflect that Department personnel are, in the vast majority of cases, checking on \nthe inmates every twenty minutes as required by Section 17.4, although in some cases the \nDeputies did not provide any details regarding the inmate's condition, the authorization for \nkeeping the inmate in the chair for more than two hours was missing, or the release time was not \nindicated.  These issues were less prevalent in the Inmate Safety Chair Security Check Logs for \nIRC.36  Further, there is no indication that medical professionals are performing any vitals checks \neven though inmates are often in the safety chairs for several hours while they are transported to \ncourt, attend the court proceedings, and are then transported back to TTCF.  Periodic vitals \nchecks are necessary in order to establish compliance with Section 17.3 even if the inmate does \nnot struggle and force is not used to place the inmate in the chair.37   \n                                                 \n36 In some cases at both TTCF and IRC, the observations occurred at the exact same time \nintervals (e.g., 15 minutes), which the Panel believes is problematic.   \n37 It is the Panel's understanding that the County and the Department do not use \"multi-\npoint restraints,\" which are subject to Section 17.6 through 17.9 of the Action Plan.    \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 23 of 27   Page ID\n#:4260\n \n \n  Section 17.10 provides that medication cannot be used solely for security purposes.  The \nDepartment's Self-Assessment, confirmed by a log of the Administration of Involuntary \nMedications, reports that there were no instances in which medication was used solely for \nsecurity purposes in the First and Second Quarters of 2019.  Accordingly, the Department has \nbeen in Compliance with Section 17.10 as of July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019.  \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Section 19.1 requires the Department to develop an Early Warning System to identify \npotentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel approved the ERS in \nJuly 2018, and it was implemented by the Department as a pilot program in the Downtown Jail \nComplex on August 1, 2018, and in the rest of the jail facilities as of November 1, 2018.  The \nDepartment has been in Compliance with Section 19.1 in the Downtown Jail Complex since \nAugust 1, 2018.   \n \n  Section 19.2 requires Compliance Lieutenants to review monthly reports generated by the \nERS and notify Unit Commanders and the Assistant Sheriff for Custody of the results, and \nSection 19.3 requires Unit Commanders to determine whether problematic employees should be \nplaced on performance mentoring program.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, \nCompliance Lieutenants must notify the Unit Commander and Assistant Sheriff for Custody \nOperations 90% of the time within 10 days after reviewing monthly reports generated by the \nEarly Warning System and 95% of the time within 30 days.  For each potentially problematic \nDepartment member identified through the Early Warning System, the Unit Commander must \nconsult with the appropriate Chief and document the reasons why any problematic members are \nnot placed on a performance mentoring program. \n \n  The Department's Sixth Self-Assessment reports that the Department achieved \nCompliance with Sections 19.2 and 19.3 in the First and Second Quarters of 2019 at all facilities \nin the Downtown Jail Complex.  The supporting documents posted by the Department show that \nthe ERS generates a Monthly Report that is reviewed by the Unit Commander, who makes the \nrequired notifications to a Chief and Assistant Sheriff.  Based upon the Unit Commanders' \nreviews of the incidents identified through the ERS, there were reassignments of duties, \nadditional formal training, assignment of a mentoring sergeant, and requests for administrative \ninvestigations.  It is apparent that Department commanders are reviewing the reports generated \nby the ERS and the incidents involving the potentially problematic Department members \nidentified by the ERS.  Although there is some variation in how often the Unit Commanders \ndecide that additional action is warranted, they are all reviewing the incidents involving their \npotentially problematic members and it appears that the ERS is working as intended.38  \nAccording, the Panel finds the Department was in Compliance with Section 19.2 and 19.3 in the \nFirst and Second Quarters of 2019.     \n                                                 \n38 One Unit Commander favored additional training while another favored mentoring.  \nThe Command staff in the Sheriff's Department should ensure that the Unit Commanders are \ntaken a consistent approach in deciding what additional action is warranted.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 199   Filed 11/26/19   Page 24 of 27   Page ID\n#:4261\n \n          APPENDIX \n \nNO.

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the “Rosas” case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the “Panel”) will “prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n[developed by the Panel] (‘Reports’) at intervals the Panel shall determine.”  This Report sets \nforth the Panel’s assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019 (the \n“Seventh Reporting Period”), and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas \ncase.  In accordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement, it takes into consideration \ncomments received from the Parties on May 15, 2020, regarding the draft of this report that was \nsent to them on May 1, 2020.     \n   \n  In May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel “to develop a corrective action plan (‘Action \nPlan’) designed to ensure that [inmates] are not subject to excessive force in the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles” (the “Downtown Jail Complex”).  The plan developed by the Panel sets \nforth provisions in twenty-one areas that the Sheriff is required to implement in the Downtown \nJail Complex.  The plan was approved by the Court on April 7, 2016.  Under Paragraph VIII of \nthe Settlement Agreement, “[w]hen the Panel certifies that any recommendation of the Action \nPlan has been implemented, it shall commence a period of monitoring the Defendant’s \ncompliance with respect to that recommendation (‘Compliance Period’).”   \n \n  The Sheriff’s Department (the “Department”) implemented 104 of the Panel’s 106 \nrecommendations as of November 1, 2018.  The remaining two recommendations, Section 4.10 \n(expansion of conflict resolution training) and Section 9.1 (security checks), have been \nsuperseded by the Settlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in United States v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, et al., CV No. 15-05903 (JEMx) (the “DOJ case”).1   \n \n  The Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex during the Seventh Reporting Period on \nAugust 13-14, 2019, and again on December 16-17, 2019.  As in the past, the Panel spoke \ninformally with inmates and Department personnel while touring the jails.  The Panel debriefed \nthe Custody leadership on the Panel’s observations of conditions in the jails, and the issues raised \nby inmates during the interviews.  As noted in the Panel’s Sixth Report, the Panel also met with \nSheriff Villanueva on October 21, 2019 for an update on Custody Operations after his first ten \nmonths in office.     \n \n  The Panel continues to have some concerns about the reduction in the number of Internal \nAffairs investigations first noted by the Office of Inspector General.  For the nine-month period \nending September 30, 2019, there were 226 investigations by the Internal Affairs Bureau for the \nentire Department in comparison to 414 investigations during the same nine-month period in \n2018.  This is by far the fewest such investigations for any year going back to 2010 (and is even \n                                                 \n1 The other recommendations in the Rosas Action Plan have been implemented in the \nother jail facilities outside of the Downtown Jail Complex pursuant to Paragraph 81 of \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the DOJ case. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 4 of 31   Page ID #:4270\n \nsignificantly fewer than in the two years prior to the investigation of the Citizens’ Commission \non Jail Violence).  (Office of Inspector General, “Report-Back on LASD Internal Administrative \nInvestigations and Dispositions of Disciplinary Actions for March, April and May 2019,” July \n22, 2019, p. 1.)    \n  With respect to the Custody Division, the Department reports that there were 170 \nadministrative investigations initiated in 2018 and 108 in 2019.  Although there was “a \nsignificant outlier in the 2018 cases” because there were 20 administrative investigations \ninitiated in response to a single incident at NCCF in March 2018, there was still a drop-off of \nmore than 20% in the number of administrative investigations from 2018 to 2019.  It should be \nnoted, however, that there were 53 internal affairs investigations initiated in the period from July \nthrough December 2018 and 64 investigations initiated in the same period in 2019.  The Panel \ndoes not share the Plaintiffs’ bald conclusion that the year-to-year reduction in administrative \ninvestigations necessarily means that the Department “has run afoul of its obligations to enforce \nthe provisions of the Settlement Agreement among its personnel.”  Plaintiffs’ Response to \nMonitors’ Draft Seventh Report, dated May 15, 2010 (“Plaintiffs’ Resp.”), p. 2. \n  Although not directly responsive to the Panel’s concerns regarding the Department’s \ncommitment to vigorously investigate allegations of misconduct, the Department reports that it \n“has taken proactive steps to guide staff in situations that have been identified by the Panel and \nthe Department as problematic,” which it “hopes. . .will have a direct correlation to the reduction \nof forces based on poor tactical decision-making.”  Defendant’s Response to Monitor’s Seventh \nDraft Report (“Defendant’s Resp.”), p. 1.  The Panel commends the Department’s continued \ncommitment to addressing these issues. \n \n  During the Seventh Reporting Period, the Department transferred the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator to another position in the Department.  Under his leadership, the Department made \nsignificant progress in its implementation of the grievance provisions of the Rosas Action Plan \nand the use of technology to receive and track the Department handling of inmate grievances.  \nThe Panel met with the outgoing Inmate Grievance Coordinator and his replacement during site \nvisits in the Seventh Reporting Period to discuss the Department’s implementation of its \ngrievance policies and procedures.  Although the Department continued to make progress in its \nhandling of inmate grievances and requests during the Seventh Reporting Period, the Panel is \nconcerned that the loss of the Inmate Grievance Coordinator’s leadership, experience, and \nexpertise will impact the Department’s ability to achieve Compliance with all of the grievance \nprovisions of the Action Plan in the near future.  This is not intended as a reflection on the new \nleadership, but a recognition of the challenges they face in replacing an outstanding Inmate \nGrievance Coordinator. \n \n  During the Seventh Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 50 completed force packages \nthat were selected by the Panel from a comprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the \nDepartment and Internal Affairs investigations of three force incidents.  The Panel also reviewed \nadditional force packages involving cell extractions to ensure that all of the force provisions of \nthe Action Plan were reviewed during the Seventh Reporting Period.  The force packages were \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 5 of 31   Page ID #:4271\n \nselected without input from the Department.2  After reviewing the completed force packages, the \nPanel met with Custody Commanders on December 17, 2019 and February 28, 2020, to discuss \nthe force incidents that were of concern to the Panel.  The reporting of the force, the supervisors’ \ninvestigations, and the Commanders’ reviews were also discussed in these meetings. \n   \n     Due to the coronavirus-related travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders, the Panel was \nunable to meet with Class Counsel as scheduled on March 20, 2020 to review issues they had \nidentified in the force packages reviewed by the Panel in the Seventh Reporting Period, and  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel did not respond to the Panel’s effort to follow-up on their suggestion to \nreview the incidents through a video conference.  Although the Panel has found input from both \nparties to be helpful in its analysis of the Force Packages, given the uncertainties of the \npandemic, the Panel was not able to delay this report pending a meeting with Class Counsel.  \nThe Panel believes that it needs to report to the Court and the parties at least every six months so \nthat its assessments of the Department’s compliance are reasonably current, even if this means \nthe Panel does not have the benefit of input from Plaintiffs’ Counsel.3  \n \n  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Department provides the Panel with self-\nassessments of its compliance with the non-force related provisions in the Action Plan.  The \nDepartment submitted its Seventh Self-Assessment Status Report (the “Seventh Self-\nAssessment”) on March 16, 2020, and augmented its self-assessment (the “Augmented Seventh \nSelf-Assessment”) on April 1, 2019.  During the Seventh Reporting Period, the Panel randomly \nselected and reviewed records posted by the Department to verify the Department’s self-\nassessments of its compliance with non-force provisions of the Action Plan.  All of the \nDepartment’s training results are subject to verification by auditors retained by the Panel. \n \n  Plaintiffs express concern with the Panel’s “reliance on [the Department’s] self- \nassessments to assess compliance” and “seemingly exclusive reliance on the results of [the \nDepartment’s] self-reporting – without any independent verification of the accuracy of such \nreporting.”  Plaintiffs’ Resp., pp 3, 4.  The Panel does not, however, simply take the \nDepartment’s self-assessments at face value.  Either the Panel’s members review the \nDepartment’s source documents themselves or the Panel’s auditors verify the Department’s \nresults (mostly with respect to the training provisions of the Action Plan).  The Panel’s auditors \nreview training records provided by the Department and, when necessary, request additional \ninformation and documentation to verify the Department’s results.  The Panel is satisfied that the \nauditors are rigorously reviewing the Department’s source documentation.    \n \n  The only example cited by Plaintiffs of the Panel’s purported “exclusive reliance” on the \nDepartment’s reported results concerns the handling of use of force grievances as required by \n                                                 \n2 Most of the force incidents reviewed by the Panel in the Seventh Reporting Period \noccurred during the First and Second Quarters of 2019.   \n3 Plaintiffs again complain that they are not able determine the Department’s compliance \nwith various provisions because of redactions applied by the Department to “documents provided \nto Class Counsel” and the video records they received “make it difficult—if not impossible—to \nassess the use of force employed.”  Plaintiffs’ Resp., pp. 5,6.  These are issues for Plaintiffs to \nresolve with the Department and, if necessary, with the Court.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 6 of 31   Page ID #:4272\n \nSection 6.4.  Id., p. 4.  Plaintiffs quote the first sentence in the paragraph in the draft report \nregarding the Department’s reported results for Section 6.4, but omit and ignore the third \nparagraph of the draft, which expressly states that “[t]he source documents posted by the \nDepartment for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 have been reviewed by the Panel.”  See Panel’s Draft \nReport, dated May 1, 2017, p. 17, and p. 20, infra.  \n \n  During the Seventh Reporting Period, there was considerable turnover in the leadership \nof the Department’s Custody Operations.  There were Acting Commanders over several \nfacilities, Acting Chiefs, and a new Assistant Sheriff, who took over the leadership of Custody in \nDecember 2019.  The Sheriff appointed new Commanders and Chiefs in Custody as of the \nbeginning of 2020.  The Panel believes that the turnover in Custody’s leadership impacted the \nDepartment’s efforts to achieve compliance with various provisions of the Action Plan in 2019.  \nThe new Custody leadership has plans to enhance training and revise policies to address some of \nthe concerns that have been expressed by the Panel, and it will be important that the Department \nhave enough time to implement and assess the efficacy of the new training and policies.   \n \n  Notwithstanding the turnover in the Custody leadership, the Department continued to \ncooperate fully with the Panel during the Seventh Reporting Period.  The Department and \nCounty Counsel facilitated our visits and inmate interviews, answered our questions, and \nresponded to our requests for documents and information.  They also engaged in constructive \nconversations with the Panel about our findings regarding the use of force incidents we had \nreviewed and the Department’s continuing efforts to implement the terms of the Rosas Action \nPlan.  We appreciate their responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, feedback and \ncomments on the Panel’s draft report, and courtesy in handling our monitoring requests.   \n \n         \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 7 of 31   Page ID #:4273\n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n  The Panel spoke to a number of inmates during our site visits in the Seventh Reporting \nPeriod.  Although we heard some complaints about the responsiveness to grievances and the \nadequacy of medical care, as in the past, the inmates consistently told us that excessive force was \nnot an issue in the County Jails.   \n \n  In the Panel’s Sixth Report, we noted that the reduction in the number of force incidents \nin the second half of 2018 in the Downtown Jail Complex continued in the first half of 2019, \nwith an average of 115 force incidents per month in these facilities, but the mix of incidents was \ndifferent.4  This trend continued in the second half of 2019, with an average of 107 force \nincidents per month.  For the year, the number of force incidents was 111 per month in 2019 in \ncomparison to 130 per month in 2018, a decrease of 14.6%.  Category 2 force incidents, \nhowever, increased 8.7% from a total of 23 per month in 2018 to 25 per month in 2019.5  At the \nsame time, the number of minor “non-categorical incidents” (“NCI’s”)6 decreased 54% from a \ntotal of 37 per month in 2018 to 17 per month in 2019.  Excluding NCIs, “categorical” force \nincidents7 were roughly the same:  93 “categorical” force incidents per month in 2018 and 94 \nsuch force incidents per month in 2019.   \n \nPlaintiffs report that they “remain incredulous regarding the 54% decrease of non-\ncategorical incidents” and “worry that NCIs are being systematically underreported.”  Plaintiffs’ \nResp., p. 3.  The Panel does not share Plaintiffs’ concern because the vast majority of force \nincidents are captured on CCTV cameras and the adverse consequences to Department members \nfor failing to report force far outweigh any perceived benefit to not reporting a minor use of \nforce.  The Panel believes that it is equally likely that the Department has de-escalated a greater \nnumber of incidents.  The Panel’s concern is that in the same period, the number of Category 2 \nforce incidents increased, which may indicate a trend towards Department members using higher \nlevels of force.  \n \n  The number of Category 3 incidents initially reported by the Department increased from \none at MCJ in 2018 to five in 2019.8  There were no Category 3 cases at either IRC or TTCF in \n2018 and 2019.  Category 3 cases initially reported represented 1.07% of the force incidents at \nMCJ and 0.3% of the force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex in 2019.  Although the \npercentage increase in Category 3 incidents at MCJ was substantial, given the small numbers it is \nnot statistically significant.  As of the date of this Report, the Panel has reviewed three of the \n                                                 \n4 See Panel’s Sixth Report, p. 4.  These figures are based upon statistics provided by the \nDepartment.   \n5 Category 2 force encompasses most incidents with an “identifiable injury,” including \nrelatively minor injuries such as a cut or a bruise.  Force that is likely to, or does, result in severe \ninjuries is classified as a Category 3 incident.    \n6 “Non-categorical incidents” (“NCI”) are minor uses of force that are used to control \ninmates, are captured on video, and do not result in injuries or complaints of pain. \n7 “Categorical” force incidents are those incidents classified as Category 1, 2, or 3.   \n8 The Department subsequently “downgraded” two of the incidents from Category 3 to \nCategory 2 because the inmates’ “injuries related to pre-existing conditions.” \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 8 of 31   Page ID #:4274\n \nCategory 3 cases and found that the force in all three cases was in compliance with the Action \nPlan and the Department’s policies.   \n \n  In addition to the use of force statistics, the Department provided the Panel with reports \nof “prevented use of force” incidents for the Downtown Jail Facilities that identify the \nDepartment members who were able to avoid or prevent the use of force in situations where \nforce has often been used.  According to the Department’s reports, in 2018 there were 1,565 \nreported uses of force and 4,800 reported “prevented use of force” incidents in the Downtown \nJail Complex.  In 2019, there were 1,334 reported uses of force and 6,134 prevented use of force \nincidents in the Downtown Jail Complex.  In other words, according to the Department’s data, as \nthe reported uses of force in the Downtown Jail Facilities have declined by approximately 15%, \nthe reported “prevented use of force” incidents have increased by approximately 28%. \n \n  These reports reflect that the Department is able to avoid the use of force in the \noverwhelming majority of court-ordered cell extractions and transfers of inmates to the Pitchess \nDetention Center in the northern part of the County, circumstances in which the potential need to \nuse force is always present.  They also reflect specific instances in which the Department \nmembers used DeVRT or verbal efforts to induce recalcitrant inmates to exit their cells (for \nmedical or mental health services or in response to court orders), return to their cells (after \nreceiving such services, court appearances, or outdoor recreation), or comply with directives \n(e.g., change into jail clothes).  Members also used these techniques to stop inmates from \nengaging in self-inflicted violence, break-up fights, or quell disturbances.       \n \n  As noted in the Panel’s Fifth Report, the Panel reviewed a Category 3 force incident in a \ncaged area between Deputy stations, but it could not resolve contradictory accounts given by \ninmates and Department personnel because the force was not captured on camera.  After \nreviewing this incident, a member of the Panel worked with the Department to identify other \nsimilar caged areas that lacked cameras and other areas where cameras should be placed.  \nAlthough the Department installed cameras in some of the identified areas, it did not install them \nin the caged areas at MCJ that are similar to where the Category 3 force incident took place.  The \nDepartment reports there was a “misunderstanding on the coverage requested” and “MCJ \nindicates that they would complete the caged area installation based on the feedback from the \nPanel.”  Defendant’s Resp., p. 3.  The Panel urges the County to install cameras in these caged \nareas at MCJ as soon as possible.  \n \n  The Panel reiterates that it cannot stress enough the importance of having cameras in all \nof the common areas of the County’s jails.  The vast majority of the force incidents have been \ncaptured on CCTV videos that are sufficiently clear to show the nature and extent of the force \nused by Department members and to enable the Panel to assess the reasonableness of the force.  \nFurther, the cameras deter assaults by inmates and excessive force by Department personnel.  \n \n  As Plaintiffs’ note, the incidents captured on CCTV cameras do not have audio, which \nwould certainly help to evaluate the Department’s “compliance with key provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement.”  Plaintiffs’ Response, p. 1.  There is, however, nothing in the Settlement \nAgreements in either the Rosas or DOJ case that require the CCTV cameras to have audio and \nthe Panel does not agree with Plaintiffs’ suggestion that it is “impossible” to evaluate these \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 9 of 31   Page ID #:4275\n \nprovisions without audio recordings.  The force packages produced by the Department include \nwritten force reports by Department members, recorded interviews of inmate suspects and \nwitnesses, and Commanders’ reviews.  In the Monitors’ experiences with numerous other \nagencies, it is not an industry standard to install audio on fixed cameras.     \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  A.  Leadership and Accountability \n \n  The recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that Custody \nbe headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the Sheriff be engaged \npersonally in the management of the jails, the Department’s managers be held accountable for \nany failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly report to the \nBoard of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and on its compliance with the Action Plan.    \n \n  The Department has been in Compliance with Sections 1.1 of the Action Plan since well \nbefore January 1, 2017.9  Custody has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of \nresponsibility since mid-2014.  It was under the direction of Assistant Sheriff Robert Olmsted \nduring most of the Seventh Reporting Period.  Following his retirement, he was replaced on \nDecember 15, 2019 by Bruce Chase.  Although Assistant Sheriff Chase does not have the \n“experience in managing a large corrections facility or running a corrections department” outside \nthe Department as recommended by the Citizens’ Commission on Jail Violence, he was formerly \nthe Captain of the Custody Compliance and Sustainability Bureau (CCSB) and a Chief in \nCustody Operations, has extensive knowledge of the requirements of the Rosas Action Plan, and \nhas expressed to the Panel his commitment to the reforms mandated by the Plan. \n \n  On October 21, 2019, the Panel met with Sheriff Villanueva and reviewed his oversight \nof the jail facilities and the Panel’s findings and observations.  As noted in the Panel’s Sixth \nReport, the Sheriff stated that he regularly meets with Custody personnel during tours of the \njails, and he acknowledged the importance of conveying that force must only be used as a last \nresort.  Sheriff Villanueva also committed to the Panel that he would increase the frequency with \nwhich he meets staff at shift change briefings and that he would use those meetings to underscore \nthe importance of the Rosas provisions. \n \n  The Department has provided the Panel with a log of the frequent meetings that Sheriff \nVillanueva had with Assistant Sheriff Olmsted from July 1, 2019, through October 23, 2019, to \nreview use of force data and trends, suicide attempts and rescue force, deployment of chemical \nagents and personal weapons, facility security concerns, assaults on staff, use of force against \n                                                 \n9 Use of the term Compliance in bold is a finding of compliance as of beginning of the \nquarter in which the Department achieves Compliance.  The Panel’s findings are set forth on the \nAppendix attached hereto.  Based upon the Panel’s findings, the parties will determine whether \nthe Settlement Agreement is subject to termination pursuant to Section VIII of the agreement.  \nAs noted in the Panel’s prior reports, the Panel encourages the “Parties to adopt a meaningful \nand achievable framework to determine the Department’s compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement” in the future.    \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 10 of 31   Page ID\n#:4276\n \nmentally ill inmates, and de-escalation techniques.  Although it does not appear that the Sheriff \nmet with Assistant Sheriff Olmsted after October 23, 2019, and the Department did not provide a \nlog of any meetings with Assistant Sheriff Chase through the end of the Seventh Reporting \nperiod in December 2019, based upon the Panel’s meeting with the Sheriff, the logs provided by \nthe Department, and the Sheriff’s visits to the Downtown Jail facilities in the Fourth Quarter of \n2019, the Panel is satisfied that the Sheriff is personally engaged in the management of the \nDepartment’s Custody operations and the Department is in Compliance with Section 1.2 of the \nAction Plan.  The Panel disagrees with Plaintiffs’ assertion that the absence of documented \nmeetings over the last two months of 2019 means that the Sheriff was not personally engaged in \nthe management of the jails during the Seventh Reporting Period.  See Plaintiffs’ Resp., p. 9. \n \n  In the Third Quarter of 2019, there was one founded disposition for violations of the \nDepartment’s use of force policies arising out of a 2017 incident in MCJ, which resulted in a \nfive-day suspension.  There were no founded dispositions at TTCF or IRC in the Third Quarter \nof 2019.  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, there was a 3.4% increase in force incidents \nat IRC, a 14.8% increase at MCJ, and a 5.3% increase at TTCF in the Third Quarter of 2019 \nfrom the Second Quarter of 2019.  Overall, there was an 8.1% quarterly increase in force \nincidents in the Downtown Jail Complex, which is below the 25% threshold that triggers a \nDepartment assessment under Compliance Measure 1.3.  Accordingly, the Department was in \nCompliance with Section 1.3 of the Action Plan at all of the Downtown Jail facilities in the \nThird Quarter of 2019.   \n \n  In the Fourth Quarter of 2019, there were two founded dispositions for violation of the \nDepartment’s use of force policies by failing to call a supervisor in one instance at MCJ and \nfailing to maintain adequate distance resulting in the use of a chemical spray on a recalcitrant \ninmate at IRC.  The Department imposed written reprimands in both cases.  Excluding non-\ncategorical force incidents, there was a 13.2% decrease in force incidents at IRC, a 22.4% \ndecrease at MCJ, and a 21.7% decrease at TTCF in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 from the Third \nQuarter of 2019.  There was an increase in the number of Category 3 incidents from none in the \nThird Quarter of 2019 to two in the Fourth Quarter; both incidents are under investigation by \nIAB, but do not appear to raise concerns about a pattern of excessive force.  Accordingly, the \nDepartment remained in Compliance with Section 1.3 of the Action Plan at all of the Downtown \nJail facilities in the Fourth Quarter of 2019.  \n   \n  The Department was in Compliance with Section 1.4 in the Seventh Reporting Period.  \nOn September 10, 2019, a Commander in Custody Operations and the Unit Commander \nresponsible for CCSB made a presentation to the Board of Supervisors on the Department’s \nCompliance with the Rosas Action Plan through the First Quarter of 2019.  One of the Panel’s \nmembers attended the Department’s presentation to the Board and responded to questions from \nthe Supervisors.  On March 4, 2020, Assistant Sheriff Chase, along with the Commander and \nCaptain in charge of CCSB, made a report to the Board of Supervisors on the Department’s \ncompliance through the Second Quarter of 2019.  We note, however, that the report was \nsomewhat cursory, and the Supervisors appeared to want more detailed and meaningful \ninformation.  The Department reports that it “will ensure the Supervisors’ questions are taken \ninto consideration in how the presentation [of the next report] is drafted.”  Defendant’s Resp., p. \n3. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 11 of 31   Page ID\n#:4277\n \n \n  B.  Management Visits \n \n  Sections 10.1 and 10.2 require the Department’s leadership to tour each of the jail \nfacilities and document those visits.  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that it  \nmaintained Compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 as of July 1, 2019, through December 31, \n2019, with 100% of the required visits by the Sheriff and Assistant Sheriff, as well as by the \nCaptains, Commanders, and Chiefs.10  The Department documented these visits, along with visits \nby Watch Commanders, as required by Section 10.2.  It appears, however, that the Sheriff only \nspent four minutes in TTCF (in module 172) and five minutes in IRC.  While the Panel \nrecognizes that the Sheriff has a myriad of responsibilities, the Compliance Measures only \nrequire him to visit each of the Downtown Jail facilities once a quarter.  In the Fourth Quarter of \n2019, it appears that he visited each of these facilities for 45 minutes each and then visited MCJ \non Christmas Day.  The Panel has reviewed the source documents provided by the Department \nand verified the other results reported by the Department and concluded that the Department has \nmaintained Compliance with Section 10.1 as of October 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019,11 \nand with Section 10.2 as of July 1, 2019, through December 1, 2019. \n \n  C.  Rotations and Transfers \n \n  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require the Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotation \npolicies and rotate personnel as required by the policies, and (2) audit each unit’s compliance \nwith its rotation policies.  The Department’s Seventh Augmented Self-Assessment reports that it \nachieved 98% Compliance in the Seventh Reporting Period.  Each of the Downtown Jail \nfacilities has a reasonably current Unit Order setting forth its rotation policy and the source \ndocuments indicate that most Department personnel are rotated in Compliance with those \npolicies.  The Department is in Compliance with Section 18.1 as of July 1, 2018, through \nDecember 31, 2019 and with Section 18.2 as of January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. \n   \n  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that it maintained 100% Compliance \nwith Section 21.1 as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.  The Panel has reviewed the \nDepartment’s source documents stating the reasons for Deputy transfers to Custody during the \nSeventh Reporting Period, which reflect that no member was transferred or assigned to Custody \nas a sanction for problematic conduct.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10 Where there is more than one Unit Commander or Commander for a facility, the \nDepartment’s posted audit results combine the tours by all of assigned commanders for that \nfacility.   \n11 The Panel agrees with Plaintiffs that the Sheriff’s visits in the Third Quarter of 2019 \nwere insufficient to satisfy Section 10.1.  This is why the Department’s Compliance with this \nprovision is as of the beginning of the Fourth Quarter of 2019, while its Compliance with Section \n10.2 has continued from an earlier period.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 12 of 31   Page ID\n#:4278\n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 of the Action Plan requires the Department to “have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]”  On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.  The Department’s Custody Force Manual satisfies Section 2.1 and includes specific \nprovisions that satisfy Sections 8.2 (Complaints of Retaliation), 17.2 (Pregnant Inmates), 20.1 \n(Types of Force), and 20.2 (Definition of Reactive Force) of the Action Plan.  The Department \nhas been in Compliance with these Sections since the Panel began monitoring the Department’s \ncompliance as of January 1, 2017. \n \n  The other recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department’s use of \nforce in Custody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Sections 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate’s medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Section 20.3 requires the Department to adopt use of force policies for Planned Force \n(such as cell extractions). \n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department’s policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  In prior reporting periods, the Department made some changes and/or additions to the \npolicies that were approved by the Panel in 2015.  Some of the changes were reviewed by the \nMonitor and the Department of Justice in the DOJ case, and reflect their comments in that case, \nbut they were not reviewed by the entire Rosas Panel.  The Panel has compared the current \nversion of the Custody Division Manual, dated August 16, 2019, with the version dated October \n15, 2015, that was approved by the Panel.  Although most of the changes were acceptable, the \nPanel has advised the Department that some modifications are necessary and recommended other \nmodifications.  By letter dated January 14, 2020, the Department notified the Panel that it had \nmade a change requested by the Panel and another that was recommended.  The Department also \nadvised the Panel that it was considering the Panel’s other recommendations.  The Panel expects \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 13 of 31   Page ID\n#:4279\n \nthat any future policy changes that impact the Rosas provisions will be submitted to the Panel for \nits review before the changes are implemented. \n     \n  A.   Third Quarter 2019 Results \n \n  Per the applicable Compliance Measures, the Panel selected 25 force incidents to review \nin the Third Quarter of 2019 without any input from the Department.  In addition, the Panel \nreviewed three cases investigated by the Internal Affairs Bureau during the Seventh Reporting \nPeriod.  As in the past, the universe of 25 force incidents selected by the Panel included a \ndisproportionate number of the more serious Category 2 incidents, particularly those involving \nthe use of personal weapons (punches) by Department personnel.  \n \n  The Panel recommends that head strikes be removed from the “Personal Weapon” \nCategory in the Department’s Use of Force policies.  Punches to the head should instead become \nits own category of “Head Strikes,” and Deputies should be required to explain specifically why \na head strike was necessary or occurred.  Training, force packages, and supervisor reviews \nshould also reflect this change in the Department’s policies.12        \n \n  As in the past, Plaintiffs have objected to the Panel’s “use of a vertical assessment to \ndetermine LASD’s compliance with the Action Plan and Settlement Agreement.”  \nNotwithstanding that Plaintiffs recognize that this “allows [the Panel] to evaluate the overall \nquality of force packages that implicate several Plan provisions,” they assert that the “vertical \nassessment is inconsistent with the Monitor’s responsibilities under the Plan” and “the \nSettlement Agreement, into which the Plan is incorporated.”  Plaintiffs’ Resp., p. 6. \n \n  As the Panel has previously explained, Plaintiff’s concern is “unfounded” because the \nPanel has undertaken both a “vertical assessment. . . of the reasonableness of each use of force \nincident taking into consideration all of the applicable provisions of the Action Plan” and also a \n“horizontal assessment of the Department’s compliance with each of the applicable provisions of \nthe Plan[.]”13  Nevertheless, based upon Plaintiffs’ objections that the vertical assessment \n“cannot form the basis of any determination under the Settlement Agreement as to the \nDepartment’s compliance [with the Action Plan],” Plaintiffs’ Resp., pp. 6-7, the Panel has \ndecided to eliminate the vertical assessments and rely exclusively on its horizontal assessment to \nreport the Department’s compliance with each of the provisions of the Action Plan applicable to \nthe Department’s use, reporting, and investigation of force by its members as requested by \nPlaintiffs.  The Panel does, however, intend to continue to meet with the Department’s \nCommanders to review force packages the Panel deems problematic. \n \n  Based upon the horizontal assessments of each provision across all of the force packages, \nthe Panel concluded that in the Third Quarter of 2019 the Department was not in Compliance \n                                                 \n12 According to Use of Force statistics provided by the Department for the Seventh  \nReporting Period, 77% of the force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex were either \nCategory 1 incidents or Non-Categorical incidents, 22.7 % were Category 2 incidents, and 0.3% \nwere Category 3 incidents.   \n13 See Panel’s Fifth Report, p. 11 (emphasis in original). \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 14 of 31   Page ID\n#:4280\n \nwith the following provisions of the Action Plan applicable to the use of force by its members:  \nforce prevention principles (Section 2.2), calling supervisors to the scene before handling \nrecalcitrant inmates (Section 2.7), and checking medical records (Section 2.13).  Because the \nPanel is no longer using the vertical assessments as a threshold for determining the Department’s \ncompliance with the use of force provisions, the Panel found that the Department was in \nCompliance as of the Third Quarter of 2019 with the remaining provisions of the Action Plan \npertaining to the Department’s use of force in Custody Operations not involving cell \nextractions.14 \n \n  As in the past, the Panel’s main concern was that Department members sometimes \nreacted too quickly and should have taken advantage of “time and distance” to de-escalate the \nsituation and avoid using force altogether or to plan a potentially safer use of force.  The failure \nto call a supervisor when confronted with a recalcitrant inmate is a variant on the need for \nDepartment members to take more time before using force to control a recalcitrant inmate.  The \nDepartment has shared with the Panel its intention to focus on these issue in its ongoing use of \nforce refresher training required by the Action Plan, and has shown the Panel videos it has \ncreated to emphasize taking advantage of time and distance and calling a supervisor to help de-\nescalate an incident whenever possible or to direct deputies when de-escalation efforts have not \nserved as an effective deterrent. \n \n  B.  Fourth Quarter 2019 Results \n \n  In the Fourth Quarter of 2019, the Panel again reviewed 25 force incidents, consisting of \na combination of investigations that were already completed and pending investigations that \nwere completed during the period.  Based upon the Panel’s assessments of each of the provisions \nin the Action Plan, the Panel concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the \nfollowing provisions of the Action Plan in the Fourth Quarter of 2019:  Force Prevention \nPrinciples (Section 2.2), Head Strikes (Section 2.6), Calling Supervisors (Section 2.7) and \nEscorting Inmates by Involved Deputies (Section 9.2).15  Based upon the Panel’s review across \nthe 25 force packages, the Panel found that the Department was in Compliance with the \nremaining use of force provisions not specifically applicable to cell extractions.  \n \n  The Panel also reviewed four cell extractions in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 to assess the \nDepartment’s compliance with specific provisions that are applicable to the use of force in those \ncircumstances (e.g., checking medical records before using force (Section 2.13), consulting with \nMental Health Professionals (Section 4.1), Use of Chemical Spray on Mentally Ill Inmates \n(Section 4.3), Cooling Off periods (Section 4.4), Mental Health Provider’s Order (Section 4. 5), \nand Planned uses of force protocols (Section 20.3)).  The Panel did not find any issues with the \n                                                 \n14 The provisions pertaining to the cell extractions were evaluated in the Fourth Quarter \nof 2019, and the Department’s Compliance with those provisions begins in that quarter. \n15 Section 9.2 prohibits involved Deputies from escorting inmates against whom force \nwas used from the scene of the incident.  Although the Panel reviewed instances in which this \nprovision was violated during this reporting period, the escorts are always videotaped and the \nPanel did not see any instance in which a Deputy involved in the force incident used additional \nforce while escorting the inmate away from the scene.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 15 of 31   Page ID\n#:4281\n \nminimal force used in the reviewed cell extractions and the Department followed all of the \napplicable protocols for use of force in those circumstances.  Accordingly, the Panel found that \nthe Department was in Compliance with those provisions as of the Fourth Quarter of 2019. \n \n  As has been the practice of the Panel, we reviewed the problematic incidents identified \nduring our review with Custody Commanders during the Panel’s site visits, and took into \nconsideration their comments in reaching the conclusions set forth in this Report.  During the \nPanel’s meetings with Commanders, the Panel again recommended that the Department use \nankle restraints when moving high risk inmates to increase safety for staff and other inmates, \nwhich the “Department continues to evaluate” for the movement of high-risk inmates.”  \n   \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining on use of force policies and on ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with \nrespect; and that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody-specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and in “identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.”  Section 12.1 requires that Custody Sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.    \n \n  The Department’s training results are subject to audit by the Panel’s auditors.  All of the \nDepartment’s reported results for the initial training of existing Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants and for new members set forth below have been verified by the Panel’s auditors based \nupon reviews of Department rosters and training records.  The auditors verified that the \nDepartment’s new members had received the required initial training from when it was first \noffered through the “as of” date reported by the Department for the completion of the initial \ntraining required for existing Deputies and Custody Assistants.  Accordingly, the Panel has \ndeemed the Department to be in Compliance “as of” the date reported by the Department for the \ncompletion of the initial training required for existing personnel.  Beginning in the Seventh \nReporting Period, the Department’s continuing Compliance with the training provisions is \ndetermined by its Compliance with the refresher training required every year or every other year. \nThe results are subject to verification by the Panel’s auditors. \n \n  A.  Use of Force Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies and Custody Assistants in the \nDowntown Jail Complex had received the initial eight-hour use of force training required by \nSection 3.1.16  96% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required \nrefresher course through December 31, 2018.17  The refresher results for the Third and Fourth \n                                                 \n16 The use of force training that was approved by the Panel includes the custody-based \nuse of force scenarios in Compliance with Section 3.4.  \n17 The Panel granted the Department extensions for Deputies who received the basic use \nof force training in 2017 and 2018 for completion of the initial refresher courses.  The Panel \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 16 of 31   Page ID\n#:4282\n \nQuarters of 2018 were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 3.1 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Department’s \nAugmented Seventh Self-Assessment reports that 94% of the Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants received the required refresher training in 2019.  The results are subject to verification \nby the Panel’s auditors. \n \n  B.  Ethics and Professionalism Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 95% of the existing personnel received the initial four-hour training \ncourse in ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with respect as required by Section 3.2.  \n95% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required refresher \ncourse through December 31, 2018.  The refresher results for the Third and Fourth Quarters of \n2018 were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department is in Compliance with Section \n3.2 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Seventh Augmented Self-Assessment \nreports that 95% of the Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants received the required refresher \ntraining in 2019.  The results have been verified by the Panel’s auditors. \n \n  C.  Mental Health Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies at the Downtown Jail Complex and in \nthe mental health unit at the Century Regional Detention Facility (“CRDF”) received the 32 \nhours of training on Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution Training (DeVRT), including the \neight hours of identifying and working with mentally ill inmates, required by Sections 4.6 and \n4.7.  Also as of that date, 98% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF, and all Deputies at the North \nCounty Correctional Facility (“NCCF”), and the Pitchess Detention Center (“PDC”) jails \nreceived the eight-hour training in identifying and working with mentally ill inmates required by \nSection 4.7.   \n \n  96% of the Deputies in the Downtown Jail Complex and the mental health unit at CRDF \nand 97% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF and the Deputies at the other facilities received the \nrequired refresher training18 for the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018.  The refresher results \nwere verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department is in Compliance with Section 4.6 and \n4.7 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Seventh Augmented Self-Assessment \nreports that for Section 4.6, 98% of the Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants received the \nrequired refresher training in 2019.  The Seventh Self-Assessment reports that for Section 4.7, \n96% of the Deputies received the required four hours of refresher training in 2019. These results \nhave been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \nexpects Department personnel to complete future refresher courses before the end of December \nof the years in which they are required.   \n18 Eight hours every other year for Section 4.6 and four hours every other year for Section \n4.7. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 17 of 31   Page ID\n#:4283\n \n  D.  New Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants \n \n  The Department has reported since the First Reporting Period that, beginning on July 1, \n2015, newly assigned Deputies have been required to complete a six-week Custody Operations \ncourse that includes training in use of force and ethics, professionalism and treating inmates with \nrespect, and new Custody Assistants have received training in these subjects during their \nAcademy training as required by Section 3.3.  The Department’s posted audit results reflect that \nthe Department has exceeded the 95% Compliance standard for new Deputies and new Custody \nAssistants for the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.19  The results were verified by the Panel’s \nauditors and the Department is in Compliance with Section 3.3 as of June 30, 2018, through \nDecember 31, 2019. \n \n  The Department previously reported that 98% of new Deputies had received the approved \nconflict resolution training in the Academy and the Jail Continuum, and 100% of newly assigned \nCustody Assistants had received the conflict resolution training (DeVRT) and training in \n“identifying and working with mentally ill inmates” required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June \n30, 2018, and that 100% of new Deputies received the training in the First Quarter of 2019, and \n98/100% of newly assigned Deputies and 100% Custody Assistants received the required \ntraining in the Second Quarter of 2019.20  These results were verified by the Panel’s auditors and \nthe Department is in Compliance with Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June 30, 2018 through June 30, \n2019.  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the new Deputies and \nnew Custody Assistants received the required training in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.  \nThese results have been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  \n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine “what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it ‘Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better;’ direct that the \nDepartment member undergo such additional training, counseling, or mentoring; and document \nthe action taken.”  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that there was one \ndisposition with this finding in the Third Quarter of 2019 and, “with the concurrence of the Unit \nCommander, it was recommended that the officer attend a ‘Force Refresher’ and a ‘Critical \nDecision Making’ class.”  There were no such cases in the Fourth Quarter of 2019.  The \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 3.5 as of July 1, 2019.   \n   \n  Section 3.6 requires Unit Commanders to review new Department members within six \nmonths of being initially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary \nperiod.  Based upon a random selection of personnel records, the Department reports that 68% of \nthe new Department members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6 in the first six months of \n2019, which is below the 95% threshold for Compliance.  The Department’s Augmented Seventh \nSelf-Assessment reports only 45% of the new members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6 \n                                                 \n19 There were no Deputy Sheriff graduations in September 2019 and no Custody \nAssistant graduations in July, September, October and November 2019. \n20 There were no newly assigned Custody Assistants in the First Quarter of 2019 or May \nof 2019. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 18 of 31   Page ID\n#:4284\n \nin the last six months of 2019.21  These results are troubling since they suggest that Unit \nCommanders are not vigorously reviewing new Department members before they receive greater \njob security after the completion of their probationary periods.  This makes it more difficult for \nthe Department to terminate problematic employees who should have been identified during their \nprobationary periods.22   \n \n  E.  Sergeant Training \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 90.4% of the Sergeants \nassigned to Custody as of October 1, 2016, had received the 16 hours of training in conducting \nuse of force investigations required by Section 12.1.  These results were verified by the Panel’s \nauditors.  The Department’s posted audit results report that 100% of the Sergeants newly \npromoted in Custody in the Second and Third Quarters of 2019 received the required training.23  \nThe results for the Second and Third Quarters of 2019 have been verified by the Panel’s auditors.     \nThe resulting cumulative compliance for newly promoted Sergeants through the Third Quarter of \n2019 falls under the 95% compliance threshold.   \n \n  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the Sergeants who were \nrequired to receive refresher training received the required refresher training in 2019.  The results \nfor 2019 have been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  \n \n4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  Many of the recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are assessed by the \nPanel through a review of the completed force packages.  Other provisions are reported by the \nDepartment as follows:    \n \n  Section 5.1 requires the Department to track use of force investigations, reviews, and \nevaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of \ndiscrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The Department reports that 89% of the force \nincidents in the Third Quarter of 2019 were timely entered into the database as required by \nSection 5.1, and 96% were timely entered in the Fourth Quarter of 2019, which is above the 95% \nthreshold required for Compliance as of the Fourth Quarter of 2019.24   \n                                                 \n21 60% were reviewed with 60 months and 80% within one year.  The Department reports \nthat 50% of the non-compliant six-month assessments were only a day late, which means that \n80% were reviewed within one day of the six-month requirement.  It also reports that four of the \none-year evaluations were not compliant because “paperwork [was] not readily available due to \nemployee resignations and movement.” \n22 The Department reports that a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) will be issued to address \nthese problems and that the Downtown Jail facilities “were briefed on the importance of ensuring \nall documents are completed in a timely manner, retained, and readily available when requested.” \n23 There were no newly promoted Sergeants in the First or Fourth Quarters of 2019. \n24 Plaintiffs response to the draft of this report states that the Panel’s “finding of \ncompliance for Section 5.1 appears to suffer from an arithmetic error.” Plaintiffs’ Resp., p 10. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 19 of 31   Page ID\n#:4285\n \n \n  Section 8.3 requires that investigations of grievances claiming that Department members \nused force to retaliate against inmates be timely evaluated by the Custody Force Review \nCommittee (“CFRC”).  The Department reports that it achieved Compliance with this provision \nin both the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.  The source documents reflect that all of these \nretaliation grievances were timely evaluated by CFRC. \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents.  The Compliance \nMeasure requires that “95% of the investigations reviewed by CFRT were not delayed beyond \nthe period permitted by law for imposing discipline.”  The Department previously reported that it \nachieved Compliance with Section 11.1 in the Second Quarter of 2018.  Because there were no \nuse of force incidents reviewed by CFRT in which there was a finding of a policy violation or \nmisconduct in either the Fifth, Sixth, or Seventh Reporting Periods, the predicate for determining \ncompliance with Section 11.1 did not exist in those periods and the Department remains in \nCompliance.   \n \n  Section 13.1 and 13.2 require the Department to document why “a member who is found \nto have been dishonest, used excessive force, or violated [the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act] \nPREA” was not terminated; place the member on a performance review program; and send a \nreport to the Inspector General.  In the Second Quarter of 2019, the Department found that two \nDepartment members had failed to report force incidents that occurred in November 2014 and \nApril 2018, and issued written reprimands.  On September 17, 2019, a Captain in MCJ approved \na recommendation that one of the members “be placed on the Unit Performance Mentoring \nProgram;” the second member was on military leave.25  \n \n  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that there were no incidents in the \nThird Quarter of 2019 that were subject to Section 13.1 and 13.2.  The Department’s posted Self-\nAssessment reports that one Department member who engaged in acts of dishonesty was \nterminated in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 and the Office of Inspector General was notified on \nMarch 20, 2020 of the termination.26  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 13.1 and \n13.2 as of the Fourth Quarter of 2019.   \n \nThe predicate for Sections 13.1 and 13.2 and the pertinent Compliance Measures is a \nDepartment finding that a member was “dishonest, used excessive force, or violated PREA.”   \n                                                 \nPlaintiffs mistakenly assumed that the Compliance finding was for the entire Seventh Reporting \nPeriod.  The Panel has revised this paragraph to make it clearer that the Compliance is only as of \nthe Fourth Quarter 2019. \n  25 The documents submitted by the Department did not reflect that a report was submitted \nto the Inspector General because “failure to report force” was included in Section 13.1, but not \n13.2.  Notwithstanding the absence of a clear directive in Section 13.2, the Department reports \nthat, going forward, it “will ensure the requirements of 13.1 are included in the letters to the OIG \nrequired under 13.2.”  Defendant’s Resp., p. 4. \n26 In the future, the Department should promptly advise the OIG of actions taken against \nmembers found to have used excessive force, engaged in acts of dishonesty, or violated PREA.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 20 of 31   Page ID\n#:4286\n \nContrary to Plaintiffs objections, Plaintiffs’ Resp., pp 11-12, these sections do not involve \ninternal investigations where the Department did not find, but arguably should have found, such \na violation.  The accuracy and truthfulness of force reports and Commanders’ reviews of those \nreports are covered by Sections 5.2 (Commanders’ Reviews); 5.3 (unexplained discrepancies); \n15.3 (reports of force by other members); 15.4 (reports of inmate’s injuries); and 15.7 (reports \nreflecting individual perceptions).  The Panel agrees with Plaintiffs that it “must vigorously \npolice use of force packages with dishonest or recklessly inaccurate reports,” Plaintiffs’ Resp., p. \n12, but not under Sections 13.1 and 13.2. \n \nSections 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of inmates for \ncriminal prosecution arising from incidents involving the use of force by Department members \nand (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of “officer misconduct that may amount to \ncriminal violations.”  The Department reports 97% in Compliance with Section 14.1 in the Third \nQuarter of 2019, and 100% in the Fourth Quarter of 2019.27  With respect to Section 14.2, there \nwere “no referrals of a Department member for possible prosecution for alleged misconduct that \nmay amount to a criminal violation for Quarter 3, 2019.”  The Department’s Augmented Seventh \nSelf-Assessment reports that 100% of the incidents were timely referred in the Fourth Quarter of \n2019.28  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 14.2 as of the Third \nQuarter of 2018, through the Fourth Quarter of 2019.   \n   \n  A.  Third Quarter 2019 Results \n \n  The Panel reviewed 25 completed force packages in both the Third and Fourth Quarters \nof 2019 to assess compliance with the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force incidents.29  The Panel concluded that the Department was not in \ncompliance with the provision regarding the Commanders’ reviews (Section 5.2), the timeliness \nof force reports (Section 15.1), the reporting of the observation of visible injuries or the lack of \nsuch injuries (Section 15.4), and photographs of members’ injuries.  In addition, the \ndocumentation provided by the Department was not sufficient for the Panel to determine the \nDepartment’s compliance with the provision relating to the separation of Department personnel \nafter a force incident (Section 15.6).  In order to achieve compliance with Section 15.6, \nseparation of Department members to write their use of force reports, the supervisor must \ndocument that the members were separated and how this separation was accomplished.  The \n                                                 \n27 Although the source documents reflect the dates that the Unit Commanders reviewed \nthe criminal reports and authorized them to “be submitted for prosecution,” the documents do not \nreflect when the referrals were received by the District Attorney as referenced in the summaries \nsubmitted by the Department.   \n28 There were five incidents that were submitted by the Internal Criminal Investigations \nBureau (“ICIB”) to the District Attorney in the Fourth Quarter of 2019.  Two of the referrals \nwere within six months of the dates the Department learned of the incidents; two were within a \nyear, and one was within two years.  All were within the three-year statute of limitations in \nSection 801 of the California Penal Code.  \n29 The Panel did not include in its assessment the three IAB cases that were ultimately \nreviewed by the Executive Force Review Committee (“EFRC”) but focused on the unit-level \nforce investigations and Commander reviews.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 21 of 31   Page ID\n#:4287\n \nDepartment was in Compliance with the remaining provisions relating to the Investigation and \nReporting of force incidents.   \n \n  B.  Fourth Quarter 2019 Results \n \n  The Panel also reviewed 25 completed force packages in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 for \nCompliance with the reporting and investigation provisions of the Action Plan.  The Panel \nconcluded that the Department was not in compliance with the provision regarding \nCommanders’ reviews (Section 5.2), and the timeliness of force reports (Section 15.1).  In \naddition, the information provided by the Department was not, in many cases, sufficient for the \nPanel to determine the Department’s compliance with the provision relating to the separation of \nDepartment personnel after a force incident (Section 15.6).  The Department was in Compliance \nwith the remaining provisions relating to the Investigation and Reporting of force incidents.  \n \nAlthough Plaintiffs state that they “have identified force packages where [Department \nmembers] appear to dishonestly present their uses of force,” they cite only one case involving a \nforce incident that took place in 2018 and that was reviewed by the Panel in the Fourth Quarter \nof 2019.  See Plaintiffs’ Resp., pp. 11-12.  In that case, Plaintiffs reference a “Supervisor’s report \nacknowledging the deputy’s false statement that he entered into the inmate’s cell with another \ndeputy and stating that no chokehold or carotid restraint used despite video showing such.”  Id., \np. 12 n. 18.  To the contrary, neither the Sergeant who conducted the force investigation nor any \nof the Commanders who reviewed the force and the investigation found that the deputy had \nmade any false statements or that he had used a chokehold or carotid restraint.  In reviewing the \nforce package, the Panel did not find that the deputy had been dishonest or had used excessive \nforce. \n   \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  The Action Plan requires extensive changes in how the Department handles inmate \ngrievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016, the Department issued a new “Inmate \nGrievance Manual” (Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual) to implement a new grievance \nsystem.  The Panel assessed the Department’s implementation of the new grievance system in \nthe Seventh Reporting Period as follows: \n \n  A.  Grievance Forms \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.6 require that separate forms for inmate grievances be reasonably \navailable to inmates and that the forms have specific check boxes.  Section 7.1 requires the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the \nDepartment’s Conflict Resolution Policy.30  Based upon site visits during the Seventh Reporting \nPeriod, the Panel concluded that the forms meeting these requirements of the Action Plan are \n                                                 \n30 The Department reports that there were “no grievances against staff complaints \nadjudicated [in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019] in which a Conflict Resolution Meeting \nwas conducted.” \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 22 of 31   Page ID\n#:4288\n \nreasonably available to inmates, and the Department remains in Compliance with those \nprovisions relating to the availability of the required forms in printed or electronic format.   \n \n  Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of the Action Plan require that use of force grievances and retaliation \ngrievances against staff are brought to the attention of Unit Commanders within 10 days and \nproperly handled.  Based upon a review of the relevant grievances in the randomly selected \nmonth, the Department reports that 100% of the use of force grievances were in Compliance with \nSection 6.4 in the Third Quarter of 2019 and 90% were in Compliance in the Second Quarter of \n2019, which meets the threshold for Compliance.  The Department also reports that 100% of the \nretaliation grievances in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019 were in Compliance with \nSection 6.5.  The source documents posted by the Department for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 have been \nreviewed by the Panel, which verified that these grievances were handled appropriately.  \n \n  B.  Emergency Grievances      \n \n  Sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the Action Plan set forth specific requirements for the \ndetermination, handling, and notifications of non-medical emergencies.  Section 6.7 requires: (1) \nDeputies to send any grievance marked “emergency” to a supervisor for review “as soon as \npossible;” (2) supervisors to determine if “the situation requires immediate action to protect the \nlife or safety of the inmate;” (3) supervisors to notify watch commanders/shift supervisors of any \nnon-medical emergencies; (4) watch commanders/shift supervisors to immediately confirm the \nemergencies exist and take action “to protect the inmates;” and (5) watch commanders/shift \nsupervisors to notify the inmate in writing about “what action was taken to address the \nemergency.”  The Compliance Measures require that 95% of the grievances marked as \nemergencies “be reviewed and handled as required by [Section] 6.7.”  It is implicit in Section 6.7 \nthat a supervisor’s determination that the situation requires immediate action and a watch \ncommander’s confirmation that emergencies exist will be reasonable.   \n \nSection 6.8 requires that if a non-medical emergency does not exist, the Department must \n(1) notify the inmate that it will be handed as a non-emergency grievance and (2) “document \nwhy it was determined not to be an emergency.”  The Compliance Measure requires that 90% of \nthe non-emergencies be “handled as required by 6.8” and that the inmate is notified within five \ndays of the non-emergency determination.   \n \nBased upon the selection and review of the grievances marked “emergency” in the \nmonths randomly selected by the Panel, the Department reports “there were no grievances that \nmet the criteria of [Section] 6.7 during the randomly selected months” in the Seventh Reporting \nPeriod.  All 50 grievances in each quarter were downgraded per Custody Division policy and \nassessed in accordance with Section 6.8.  The Panel reviewed the 50 grievances assessed by the \nDepartment for the Third Quarter of 2019 and determined that two of the grievances should have \nbeen handled as emergencies.  Thus, 96% of the grievances were properly handled by the \nDepartment as non-emergencies, which is above the threshold for Compliance in the Third \nQuarter of 2019.31  The Panel also reviewed the 50 cases assessed by the Department for the \n                                                 \n31 In one of the two cases, the Department appears to have handled the grievance as an \nemergency notwithstanding the non-emergency determination.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 23 of 31   Page ID\n#:4289\n \nFourth Quarter of 2019 and determined that one of the grievances should have been handled as \nan emergency and that 98% of the grievances were properly handled as non-emergencies.  \nAccordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 6.7 for the period July 1, 2018, \nthrough December 31, 2019.  Nevertheless, the Panel agrees with Plaintiffs that, going forward, \nthe Department must provide better explanations for downgrades of “emergency” grievances to \nnon-emergencies.  A conclusory statement that the grievance was deemed not to be an \nemergency is not sufficient if, on its face, the grievance suggests that there is some urgency to it. \n \nThe Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports 96% Compliance with the \nnotification provisions of Section 6.8 for the Third Quarter of 2019, and 94% Compliance in the \nFourth Quarter of 2019.  The source documents posted by the Department for Section 6.8 reflect \nthat inmates are notified that their grievances are being handled as non-emergencies, but often do \nnot document the reasons for the downgrade as required by Section 6.8.  Accordingly, the Panel \nis not able to assess the Department’s compliance with Section 6.8. \n \n  C.  Inmate Grievance Coordinator \n \n  Section 6.9 requires that emergency grievances be forwarded to the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator.  Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 require the Inmate Grievance Coordinator to track the \nDepartment’s handling of inmate grievances, provide a monthly report to the Unit Commander \nand senior management in Custody on the status of inmate grievances, and analyze inmate \ngrievances for problematic trends.  The Panel met with the Department’s Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator during both site visits in the Seventh Reporting Period to review the Department’s \nimplementation of the new grievance system and the reports generated for the Department’s \nmanagers.  The Department provided documentation to the Panel showing that for the Third and \nFourth Quarters of 2019, the Inmate Grievance Coordinator received the information about \nemergency grievances required by Section 6.9 and prepared detailed reports for managers as \nrequired by Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.32  The Department is in Compliance with Sections \n6.9, 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15, as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.  \n \n  The Panel believes that the structure of the grievance system developed by the \nDepartment under the overall direction of an Inmate Grievance Coordinator who monitors each \nfacility’s compliance with the grievance provisions of the Action Plan is effectively and \nefficiently handling inmate grievances and requests for service.  The Panel believes that it is \nsufficiently centralized to be in Compliance with Section 6.16.  Plaintiffs once again object to \nthe Panel’s finding on the grounds that the Panel has “overstepped the bounds of [its] authority.”  \nThe Panel disagrees; Plaintiffs’ remedy under the Settlement Agreement is to address this with \nthe Court. \n \n                                                 \n32 While those reports are very detailed, they would be improved if they included the \noutcomes of grievances (percentage sustained, percentage denied, other findings) and the \noutcomes of appeals broken down by type of grievance and facility. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 24 of 31   Page ID\n#:4290\n \n  D.  Handling of Grievances \n \n  Sections 6.10 and 6.12 require that grievances be collected daily, logged in, and tracked \nin an inmate grievance database.  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that 100% \nof the grievances were collected and reviewed within 24 hours and handled as required in both \nthe Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.  The source documents for these results posted by the \nDepartment were reviewed by the Panel and support the Department’s reported findings.  \nAccordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 6.10 as of January 1, 2019, through \nDecember 31, 2019. \n \n  The Department’s posted Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the grievances at both \nMCJ and TTCF in the randomly selected months in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019 were \nentered into the database as required by Section 6.12.  Again, the source documents for these \nresults were available to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in \nCompliance with Section 6.12 as of the July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.  \n \n  Section 6.11 requires that the Custody Division Manual provide that failing to comply \nwith Department policies requiring proper handling of inmate grievances may be cause for \ndiscipline.  The Department reports that there were two claims that Department members \nimproperly handled inmate grievances during the Seventh Reporting Period, but no members \nwere found to have violated the grievance policy.  The source documents do not, however, \ninclude the basis for the Department’s findings in those two cases.33   \n \n  Section 8.1 prohibits Department personnel from retaliating against inmates.  The \nDepartment previously reported that it was in Compliance with Section 8.1 as of March 31, \n2018, through June 30, 2018.  The Department posted the results of the investigations approved \nby Unit Commanders in the randomly selected months and the number of anti-retaliation \ngrievances received and investigated in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.  It reports that \nthere were no founded violations of the anti-retaliation policy in either quarter.  Accordingly, the \nDepartment has maintained Compliance with Section 8.1 through December 31, 2019.   \n \n  Plaintiffs complain that the Panel concluded the Department “maintained compliance \nwith Section 8.1, even though it did not review any supporting documents whatsoever.  The \n[Panel] must ensure not only that discipline is imposed, but also that [the Department] comes to \nreasonable conclusions in its investigations and metes out appropriate punishments.”  Plaintiffs’ \nResp. p. 11 (cite omitted).  The Department’s “posted results of the investigations approved by \nUnit Commanders in the randomly selected months” summarized the investigations and the basis \nof the Unit Commanders’ findings that there were no violations of the anti-retaliation provisions.  \nThe Panel reviewed these summaries and determined that the investigations and conclusions \nwere reasonable.  It will be incumbent upon the Department to continue to provide the Panel \nwith the investigations approved by the Unit Commanders in the randomly selected months (up \nto a maximum of the first 25 investigations approved) so that the Panel can continue to assess the \n                                                 \n33 Plaintiffs assert that the Panel’s “finding of compliance with Section 6.11 is unfounded \nat this time.”  Plaintiffs’ Resp., p. 10.  The Panel did not, however, find the Department in \nCompliance with Section 6.11.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 25 of 31   Page ID\n#:4291\n \nreasonableness of the Department’s investigations and conclusions regarding retaliation \ngrievances.  \n \n  E.  Deadlines    \n \n  Sections 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, and 6.20 set forth the deadlines for filing use of force and \nPREA grievances,34 the Department’s initial responses, inmates’ right to appeal, and the \nDepartment’s notifications of the results of the investigations.  The Department’s Seventh Self-\nAssessment reports that it adhered to the deadlines for these grievances in both the Third and \nFourth Quarters of 2019.  The Department achieved 100% compliance with all of these \nprovisions in both quarters except that “no items were identified for the Department’s self-\nassessment universe” for Section 6.17 in the Third Quarter of 2019 and there was 96% \nCompliance with Section 6.19 in the Fourth Quarter of 2019.  The Panel agrees that the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 6.17 as of October 1, 2019, through December 31, \n2019 and Sections 6.18 and 6.20 as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.  As previously \nnoted by the Panel, however, the Department needs to report on the timeliness of responses by \nCorrectional Health Services to inmate grievances against the medical staff (e.g., lack of a timely \nresponse to a request for medical service) to achieve Compliance with Section 6.19. \n \n  The Seventh Self-Assessment also reports that the Department adhered to the deadlines \nfor advising inmates of the results of adjudications as required by Section 7.2 for Third Quarter \n(92%) and the Fourth Quarter (96%) of 2019.  The posted source documents for these results \nwere available to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 7.2 as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.  \n   \n  F.  Communications with Inmates   \n   \n  Section 7.3 requires the Department to “ensure that there are adequate avenues for \nconstructive prisoner-staff communication[.]”  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment \nreports that the Department was in Compliance with Section 7.3 during both the Third and \nFourth Quarters of 2019.  The Department provided logs of Town Hall meetings at MCJ and \nTTCF during the randomly selected months the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019 that included \nTown Hall meetings in special housing units as well as in General Population housing units.  \nBased upon these logs, the Panel is of the view that the Department has achieved Compliance \nwith Section 7.3 in the for the period April 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. \n     \n6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include “a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints” identified in this recommendation.  \nThe Department included such a separate section in the Manual and is in Compliance with this \nrequirement of Section 17.1, effective December 1, 2015. \n   \n                                                 \n34 Section 6.18 provides that there is no deadline for filing PREA grievances.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 26 of 31   Page ID\n#:4292\n \n  Section 17.3 requires medical examinations of inmates placed in safety chairs and \nSection 17.4 requires safety checks of inmates in fixed restraints every twenty minutes.  Periodic \nvitals checks are necessary in order to establish Compliance with Section 17.3, even if the inmate \ndoes not struggle and force is not used to place the inmate in the chair.  \n \n  The Compliance Measures require the Department to provide the Panel “with a list of \nincidents in which inmates were placed in a Safety Chair, restrained to a fixed object for more \nthan 20 minutes, or subjected to security restraints for an extended length of time” in the \nDowntown Jail Complex.35   \n \n  During the Seventh Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed the Inmate Safety Chair \nSecurity Check Logs and Fixed Restraint logs at Downtown Jail Complex provided by the \nDepartment for the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.  The Inmate Safety Chair Security Check \nLogs and fixed restraint logs reflect that Department personnel are, in the majority of cases, \nchecking on the inmates every twenty minutes as required by Section 17.4, although in some \ncases the Deputies did not provide any details regarding the inmate’s condition, the authorization \nfor keeping the inmate in the chair for more than two hours, or the release time.  Department \npersonnel also used a variety of forms that make it difficult for the Panel to verify the results and \nconfirm its Compliance with Section 17.4.   \n \n  Finally, there is no indication that medical professionals are performing any vitals checks \neven though inmates are often in the safety chairs for several hours while they are transported to \ncourt, attend the court proceedings, and are then transported back to TTCF.  The Department \nreports that the “Custody Division intends to work with the Court Services Division and the \ncriminal courts to ensure inmates do not remain in the safety chairs for longer than absolutely \nnecessary.”     \n \n  Section 17.10 provides that medication cannot be used solely for security purposes.  The \nDepartment’s posted Self-Assessment, confirmed by a log of the Administration of Involuntary \nMedications, reports that the overwhelming majority of involuntary medications were pursuant \nto court orders and there were no instances in which medication was used solely for security \npurposes in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.  Accordingly, the Department has been in \nCompliance with Section 17.10 as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.  \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Section 19.1 requires the Department to develop an Early Warning System to identify \npotentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel approved the \nEmployee Review System (“ERS”) in July 2018, and it was implemented by the Department as a \npilot program in the Downtown Jail Complex on August 1, 2018, and in the rest of the jail \nfacilities as of November 1, 2018.  The Department has been in Compliance with Section 19.1 \nin the Downtown Jail Complex since August 1, 2018.   \n \n                                                 \n35 Sections 17.6 through 17.9 govern the application of multi-point restraints, which the \nPanel has been advised by the Department it does not use. \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 27 of 31   Page ID\n#:4293\n \n  Section 19.2 requires Compliance Lieutenants to review monthly reports generated by the \nERS and notify Unit Commanders and the Assistant Sheriff for Custody of the results, and \nSection 19.3 requires Unit Commanders to determine whether problematic employees should be \nplaced on performance mentoring program.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, \nCompliance Lieutenants must notify the Unit Commander and Assistant Sheriff for Custody \nOperations 90% of the time within 10 days after reviewing monthly reports generated by the \nEarly Warning System and 95% of the time within 30 days.  For each potentially problematic \nDepartment member identified through the Early Warning System, the Unit Commander must \nconsult with the appropriate Chief and document the reasons why any problematic members are \nnot placed on a performance mentoring program. \n \n  The Department’s Seventh Self-Assessment reports that the Department achieved \nCompliance with Sections 19.2 and 19.3 in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019 at all facilities \nin the Downtown Jail Complex.  The supporting documents posted by the Department show that \nthe ERS generates a Monthly Report that is reviewed by the Unit Commander, who makes the \nrequired notifications to a Chief and Assistant Sheriff.  Based upon the Unit Commanders’ \nreviews of the incidents identified through the ERS, there were reassignments of duties, \nadditional training in a “force concepts class,” and requests for administrative investigations.  It \nis apparent that Department commanders are reviewing the reports generated by the ERS and the \nincidents involving the potentially problematic Department members identified by the ERS.  \nAlthough there is still some variation in how often the Unit Commanders decide that additional \naction is warranted and what action they take, they are all reviewing the incidents involving their \npotentially problematic members.  Accordingly, the Panel finds the Department was in \nCompliance with Section 19.2 in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2019.     \n \n  With respect to Section 19.3, it is apparent that the Unit Commanders are, in consultation \nwith the appropriate Chiefs, evaluating members who are identified through the ERS.  The Panel \nis concerned, however, that there is a lack of detail regarding the reason why the TTCF Unit \nCommander decided no action was necessary for the TTCF members identified in the ERS and \nwhy the MCJ Commander decided that training was appropriate in some cases.36  The reasons \nfor the reassignments of personnel at IRC were adequately explained.  The Department reports \nthat it “is looking at developing guidelines for Unit Commanders to utilize for deciding \ncorrective actions[.]”   \n   \n                                                 \n36 The Panel assumes that this “force concepts class” recommended by the MCJ Unit \nCommander is different than the annual use of force refresher class required by Section 3.1 of \nevery Department member.  The annual refresher course is not appropriate as a remedial measure \nfor individuals with disproportionate number of use of force situations.  The Department needs to \nprovide the Panel with the specifics of this class before the Panel can conclude that the course is \nan appropriate remedial measure.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 201   Filed 06/01/20   Page 28 of 31   Page ID\n#:4294\n \n    \n \n            APPENDIX \n \nNO.

This action is brought pursuant to the Eighth and Fourteenth \n3  Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This \n4  Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). \n5  2.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the \n6  Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S. C.§ 1391. \n7  II~  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n8.  3.  Plaintiffs Alex Rosas and Jonathan Goodwin are inmates in the \n9  custody of Sheriff Leroy Baca in the Los Angeles County Jails.  Rosas and \n10  Goodwin have been beaten and threatened with violence by deputies of the Los \n11  Angeles County Sheriffs Department (the \"Department\" or \"LASD\").  Mr. Rosas \n12- and Mr. Goodwin have also witnessed deputies beating other inmates.  The abuse \n13  that Rosas and Goodwin suffered and witnessed is typical of the abuse inflicted by \n14  deputies on countless other inmates in the jails, and is part of a pattern and practice \n15  of deputy-on-inmate violence that has persisted for many years.  In the last few \n16  years alone, there have been dozens of documented cases of extreme and unjustified \n17  violence by deputies against inmates;  Defendant and other high ranking officials at \n18  the Department1 are-aware of the culture of deputy violence that pervades the Jails \n19  but have failed to take reasonable measures to remedy the problem.  Plaintiffs \n20  charge Sheriff Leroy Baca (\"Defendant\" or \"Sheriff Baca\"? with violations of \n21 -\n1 Plaintiffs named Undersheriff Paul Tanaka (\"Tanaka\")~Assistant Sheriff Cecil \nRhambo (\"13hambo'),, and Chief o.f C:usto~y Operations vermis Bums (\"Bums\") as_ \n22 \ndefendants m the ongmal Complamt m this case.  Tanaka, Rhambo, and Bmns are \nnot named as defendants in this First Amended Complaint because the Court \n23  dismissed those defendants and ordered Plaintiffs to submit a new complaint \nconsistent with the Court's ruling of dismissal.

Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves \n3  and other current and future inmates in the Los Angeles County Jails, seeking \n4  injunctive and declaratory relief. \n5  4.  Los Angeles County has the largest jail system in the world, \n6  with an average daily population of approximately 15,900 inmates.  The great \n7  majority of the inmates are pre-trial detainees who.are not being held pursuant to a \n8  criminal conviction.  Large numbers of inmates in the jails have_not committed, and \n9  are not charged with, with violent offenses.  There are inmates held in the jails on \n10  Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) holds, charges of public intoxication, \n11  traffic violations, and warrants for failure to appear on a wide variety of minor \n12  offenses.3  Indeed a number of the inmates whose beatings ar.e described in this \n13  First Amended Complaint were being detained on non-violent misdemeanors, \n14  improper warrants and other minor offenses.  See Paragraphs_6 7-68, 157.  Deputy \n1 S  violence against inmates in the Los Angeles County Jails is commonplace, but it is. \n16  especially pervasive in three facilities that comprise a single complex on Bauchet \n17  Street in downtown Los Angeles:  Men's Central Jail, Twin Towers Correctional \n18  Facility (\"TICF\") and the Inmate Rec~ption Center (\"IRC\") (collectively, \"the \n19  Jails\"). \n20  5.  Irimates in the Jails live in fear of deputy violence.  It is typical \n21  for deputies to subject unresisting inmates to grossly excessive force by slamming \n. \n~ \n22  inmates' heads into walls, punching them in the face with their fists, kicking them \n23  with their boots, and shooting them multiple tiilles with their tasers - and for these \n24  beatings to result in serious injuries to the inmates, including broken legs, fractured \n25  eye sockets, shattered jaws, broken teeth, severe head injuries, nerve damage, \n26  3 Los An_geles County Jail Overcrowding Reduction Report, at xvi Vera Institute of \nJustice, September 2011 (\"Vera staff observed arraignrp.ents for people who spent \n27  one or two nights in jail for FTA on charges of not paying a $1.50 metro fare.  Vera \nwas told that some judicial officers routinely set bail at $50,000 for one FTA, and \n-28  -jail sentences for FTA forjay walking and failure to pay traffic fines.\") . . \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \n-2-\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 4 of 83   Page ID #:916\n1  dislocated-joints, collapsed lungs, and wounds requiring dozens of stitches and \n2  ·staples.  Deputies sadistically beat inmates with serious mental illness.  They have \n3  beaten inmates who are already in fragile medical condition, including inmates in \n4  wheelch~irs. Deputies have beaten inmates for asking for medical treatment, for \n5  the color of their skin, or for no apparent reason at all.  Deputies also enlist and \n6  encourage other inmates to carry out savage attacks. \n7  6.  Many of the beatings that.routinely occur in the jails ·are far \n8  more severe than the infamous 1991 beating ofRodney King by members of the \n9  Los Angeles Police Department.  The violence is not the work of a few rogue \n10  deputies. Rather, it is a systemic problem that has continued unchecked for \n.1 1 \ndecades . \n.12 \n7.  Many deputies belong to gangs inside the Jails.  Like members \n13  of street gangs, these deputies sport tattoos to signal their gang membership.  They \n14  beat up inmates to gain prestige among their peers, and \"earn their ink\" by breaking \n15  inmates' bones.  They seek to control the Jails, and to a significant degree they do \n16  control the areas where they work. \n17  8. · ·  The \"3000 Boys\" is one such deputy gang, named for the third \n18  floor ofMen's Central Jail where its members work.  Members of the 3000 Boys, \n19  who sport a \"3000\" tattoo on the backs of their necks, inflict violence on inmates, \n20  foment violence among inmates, and even deploy violence on other deputies who \n21 ·  resist their abusive practices.  A similar deputy gang operates on the second floor of \n22  Men's Central Jail.  On information and belief, members of the \"2000 Boys\" \n23  . designate their gang membership with tattoos of a Roman numeral \"II\" on their \n24  legs.  Violent deputy gangs have operated in the LASD at least since the 1980s and \n25  perhaps since the early 1970s.  The 3000 Boys and 2000 Boys have been operating \n26  with the Defendant's knowledge and acquiescence. \n27  9.  The Defendant's ongoing failure to halt these abuses has \n28  communicated to the deputy gangs that they can carry out brutal assaults on inmates \n-3- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINTIJNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 5 of 83   Page ID #:917\n1  with impunity.  In fact, the Defendant's permissiveness has so emboldened the \n2  deputy gangs that they have begtm to carry out their brutal assaults on inmates more \n3  and more openly, and even in the presence of civilian volunteer workers in the Jails. \n4  Jail chaplains and the court-appointed jail monitors of the American Civil Liberties \n5  Union (\"ACLU'')\"have provided eyewitness accounts of deputies beating non-\n6  resisting inmates in the Jails. \n7  10.  There is a widespread fear among inmates of reporting deputy \n8  misdeeds to the ACLU or anyone else, because deputies ·regularly retaliate against \n9  those who lodge complaints, with·b  eatings, strip searches, body cavity searches, \n10  destructive cell shake-downs, confiscation of belongings, and trumped-up. \n11  disciplinary and criminal charges. \n12  11.  Defendant and all of the high-ranking officials in the \n13  Department are aware - and,\" in the case of at least three of them, have been aware \n14  for years- of the pattern of deputy violence, intimidation, and retaliation against \n15  inmates.  It has been publicly reported, documented, and condemned on scores of \n16  occasions during the past twenty years.  Starting in 2006, a captain and a now-\n17  retired commander, both in the custody division, have reported to SheriffBaca and \n18  other high ranking officials at the Department problems with deputy gangs and \n19  deputies using excessive and unnecessary force, but the Defendant did not take \n20  appropriate steps to address the problem.  SheriffBaca, Undersheriff Tanaka, Chief \n21  Burns, and other sup~rvisors in these jails and at the highest levels of the \n22  Department have acquiesced in, fostered, and implicitly authorized the abuse by \n23  failing to promulgate adequate policies on the use of force, failing to adequately \n24  train and supervise deputies in the face of historical and continued· evidence of \n25  abuse, failing to conduct meaningful investigations of reports of excessive force, \n26  failing to hold guilty deputies accountable, and ignoring evidence that deputies and \n27  other Department officials are covering up incidents of excessive force. \n28 · \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \n-4-\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 6 of 83   Page ID #:918\n1  12.  In 1992, the prestigious Kolts Commission-'- formed at the \n2  behest of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to conduct a review of the \n3  policies, practices, and procedures of the Sheriffs Department - issued a scathing \n4  report documenting numerous incidents of excessive force, lax discipline, and the \n5  presence of deputy gangs.  The Kolts Report resulted in the appointment of Special \n6  Counsel to the Board of Supervisors for Oversightofthe Sheriffs Department, \n7  -Merrick Bobb.  Bobb issued 30 semi-annual reports between 1993 and 2011.  The \n8  County's Office of Independent Review (\"OIR\"), headed by Michael Gennaco, has \n9  repeatedly reported incidents of serious abuse to SheriffBaca.  The ACLU, which \n-10  serves as class counsel to all detainees in Los Angeles County Jails in Rutherford v. \n11  Baca, No. 75-04111 (C.D. Cal.), and which has been appointed by the District \n12 ·  Court in that case to monitor conditions in the Los Angeles County Jails, has \n13  submitted multiple reports to SheriffBaca over several years, documenting more \n14  than 70 cases of extreme deputy-on-inmate violence. \n.  -\n15  13.  Despite SheriffBaca's actual knowledge of this pattern of \n16  violence and cover-ups, he has failed over a period of many years to take \n17  -reasonable measures to halt the abuses.  Even now that the pervasiveness and the \n18  extraordinary brutality of the deputy-on-inmate abus.e has become common \n19  knowledge through the release of reports by the ACLU, SheriffBaca has left in \n20  place his principal subordinates in charge of supervising the Custody Division of \n21  the Sheriffs Department, Undersheriff Paul Tanaka and Chief Bums, who have \n22  day-to-day responsibility fot ensuring the inmates' safety, and under whose regime \n23  this pattern of abuse has flourished. \n24  14.  The ultimate goal of this lawsuit is to end the longstanding \n25  -pattern ofdeputy-on-inmate abuse by requiring the Defendant to put in place a \n26  system of accountability, which they have for so long failed to do.  That system \n27- must include, at min1mum, adequate policies on the use of force, proper training on \n28  the policies, proper supervisi-on of deputies, thorough review of use of force \n-5- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 7 of 83   Page ID #:919\n1  incidents) and appropriate discipline for improper use of force or failure to report its \n2  use. \n3  ill.  PARTIES \n· 4  15.  Plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin are inmates in the custody of the \n5  LASD who were previously housed in Men) s Central Jail and ·are currently housed \n6  in Twin Towers.  Plaintiffs have been subjected to deputy violence and threats of \n7  violence and they have witnessed deputies violently abusing other inmates.  They \n8  are at continuing risk of being subjected to deputy violence as a result of the \n9  Defendant)s acts and omissions. \n10  16.  Defendant Leroy Baca has been the Sheriff of Los Angeles \n11  County since 1998.  As Sheriff, he is the chief executive officer of the LASD. By \n12  California law, the Sheriff is answerable for the safekeeping of the inmates in his \n13  custody.  Cal. Gov)t Code§§ 26605, 26610; Cal. Penal Code§ 4006.  SheriffBaca \n14  is responsible for the management and control of all Los Angeles County Jails, and \n15  for all matters relating to the selection, supervision, promotion, training, and \n16  discipline of the uniformed staff) including the supervisory security staff) of the \n17  County Jails.  He is also responsible for the care, .custody) and control of all inmates \n18  housed in the County Jails.  SheriffBacais regularly provided with reports of \n19  applications of force, allegations of unreported and excessive use of force, and \n20  other breaches of security in the County Jails.  Plaintiffs sue SheriffBaca in his \n21  official capacity. \n22  17.  SheriffBaca is sued in his official capacity for declaratory and \n23  injunctive relief.  At all times referred to in this First Amended Complaint, the \n24  Defendant was acting within the scope of his employment as an employee of the \n25  · Department, and acting under color of state and muniCipal law. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-6- .

There Is A Longstanding, Pervasive, And Notorious Culture, \n3  Pattern, And Practice Of Deputv Violence Against Inmates In The \n4  Los Angeles County Jails \n. 5 \n18.  There is a longstanding pattern and practice in the Los Angeles \n6  County Jails, and particularly in the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles, of \n7  deputy-on-inmate violence and deputy-instigated inmate-on-inmate abuse. \n8  Multiple oversight and monitoring agencies, including the U.S. Department of \n9  Justice, the.LASD's OIR, the Special Counsel to the Los Angeles County Board of \n10  Supervisors for oversight of the Sheriffs Department, and the ACLU, have issued \n11  reports on the use of excessive force and other abuses by the LASD against the \n12  inmates in its custody and in many cases made recommendations to address the \n13  problem. \n14  19.  According to Thomas Parker, a former FBI agent and Assistant \n15  Special Agent in Charge ofthe Bureau's Los Angeles Field Office, who oversaw \n16  the FBI investigation into the force, \"There is at least a two-decade history of \n17  corruption within the ranks of the LASD .. .. [N]o one at the command level ... \n18  · appears to have been held accountable and appropriately punished for failure to \n19  properly supervise and manage their subordinate personnel and resources.  In my \n20  opinion, this has provided the 'seedbed' for continued lax supervision, violence, \n21  and corruption Within LASD and the county jails it administers.\"  SheriffBaca and \n22  other LASD.officials have \"essentially abdicated their responsibilities to provide a \n23  safe; secure, and corruption-free incarceration environment within the Los Angeles \n24  ·County Jail System.\"  The result, Mr. Parker concluded, is a pattern of irimates \n25  \"suffering severe injuries, maiming, and death, some caused by fellow inmates, but \n26  most often at the hands of, or with the acquiescence or assistance of, the deputy \n27  sheriffs who are their keepers.\" Mr. Parker states, \"I have never experienced any \n28 \n-7- .

In May 1990, the Los Angeles Times published an investigative \n4  report disclosing that excessive force cases represented three-fourths. of all major \n5  legal settlements and jury awards over a three-year period; that half of the deputies \n6  involved.in major cases had been sued in the past for brutality; and that one training \n7  officer had been sued ten times in ten years.  The newspaper quoted sources \n8  familiar with the Department who claimed that a code of silence made deputies \n9  reluctant to testify against fellow officers, even those who repeatedly used \n10  excessive force.  The Department kept no separate records of the deputies who were \n11  sued for excessive force or the outcomes of the suits.4 \n12  21.  In 1989, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors formed a \n13  blue-ribbon commissio.n to conducta review of\"the policies, practices and \n14  procedures of the Sherif.Ps Department, including recruitment, training, job \n15  performance and evaluation, record keeping and management practices, as they \n16  relate to allegations of excessive force, the community sensitivity of deputies and \n17  the Department's citizen complaint procedure.\"  The Board of Supervisors  . \n18  appointed the late Judge James G. Kolts (\"Kolts\") as Special Cotmsel to the Board. \n19  Kolts was a former star prosecutor and a highly respected former Los Angeles \n20  County Superior Court judge.  The team Kolts assembled for this project becatne \n21  known as the Kolts Commission.  In July 1992, after an extensive investigation, the \n22  Kolts Commission issued a scathing 359-page report (the \"Kolts Report\").5  The \n23  Kolts Report detailed a history of excessive use of fore~ and lax discipline withiri. \n24 \n25 \n4 Merrick Bobb, Police Assessment Resource Center {\"P ARC\") 1Oth Semiannual \n26  Reportl2 (Feb. 1999) (citing D~l Kelley & Victor Merina, Al1l eged Brutality by \nDeputies Costs County:  Law En orcement: ·Excessive-Force Lawsuits Have Nearly \n27  Doubled in Recent Years.

In January 1993, the Board of Supervisors passed a resolution to \n4  carry out the recommendations of the Kolts Commission, and the Board retained \n5  Special Counsel, Merrick J. Bobb, to monitor LASD's compliance with the Kolts \n6  Report and to report to the Board semi-annually regarding such compliance.7  Bobb \n7  continues to serve to this day as Special Counsel to the Los Angeles County Board \n8  of Supervisors, and remains the Board of Supervisors' morutor of the LASD and its \n9  operations.8 \n10  23.  In his fourth Semiannual Report, dated June 1995, Special \n11  Counsel Bobb reported the following: \n12  24.- \"[W]e continued to find too many cases involving unnecessary \n13  force in responses to verbal taunts or passive noncompliance.  Most of these \n14  incidents arose in the jails, where we found a substantial number of instances where \n15  deputies appear to over-react to apparently slight provocations, like stepping out of \n16  the chow line, by shoving the inmate against the wall or slapping him in the face.\" \n17  Further, the use of \"transparently phony pretext[ s] ('the suspect stared at me \n18  aggressively') to justify .or excuse unnecessary or excessiye force ... is still \n19  practiced to an uncomfortable and unacceptable degree in the custody setting.;'9 \n20  25.  \"[W]e do not believe that The Department has yet implemented \n21  the Kolts recommendations with respect to force investigations.\"10 \n22  26.  \"In its analysis of over 1,000 force-related investigations \n23  spanning a five-year period, the Kolts Report concluded that the Department was \n24  too lenient ill the way it disciplined officers found to have engaged in excessive \n25  force.

In a 1997letter from the Acting Assistant Attorney General of \n6  the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ('.'DOJ\") to the then-Los \n'  . \n7  Angeles County Executive, Joanne Sturges, the DOJ reported that \"Inmates who are \n8  mentally ill or housed in mental health housing are subject to an unacceptably high \n9  risk of physical abuse and other mistreatment at the hands of other inmates and \n10  custodial staff.  Moreover, the Jail does not adequately investigate allegations of \n11  abuse against its inmates.\"13  The DOJ reported that they had \"received numerous \n12  reports from inmates and advocates regarding serious physical abuse of inmates in \n.  . \n13  mental health housing ... including kicks, punches, beatings, and sexual assaults. \n14  Although the Jail claims that it has discounted some of these claims·. .. the \n15  investigation of these claims was inadequate and serious questions remain \n16  regarding the extent of physical abuse of mentally ill inmates.  We agree with \n17  Special Counsel Merrick Bobb's finding that in the Jail 'there is callous treatment \n18.

In his tenth Semiannual Report, dated February 1999, Special \n4  Counsel Bobb pointed to a long list of recent crises on the custody side of the \n5 .  Department, including \"troubling inmate deaths at the hands of custody \n6  personnel[,]\" \"inmate on inmate violence[,]\" and \"vigilante-like behavior at Twin \n7  Towers.\"17 \n8  29.  On December 19, 2002, the Los Angeles County and the United \n9  States entered into a Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Ment~l Health \n1 0 ·  Services at the Los Angeles County Jail (\"MOA\"). 18  Sheriff Baca was one of the \n11  signers-of the MOA, which was entered into \"to avoid potential litigation \n12  concerning the mental health services at the Jail.\"19  Among the provisions in the \n13  MOA were ones addressing training of correctional staff in \"professional and \n14  humane treatment of mentally ill inmates,\" and the prevention and investigation of \n15  abuse ofmentally ill inmates?0 \n16  30.  In March 2003, the US DOJ sent to County Counsel a \n17  compliance letter on the 2002 MOA about treatment of the mentally ill.  The letter \n18  concluded that the Sheriffs Department was not in compliance with the \n-19  requirement of the MOA that LASD \"provide mandatory orientation and continuing \n20  competency-based training for correctional staff in the identification and custodial \n21  care ofmeritally ill inmates including, but not necessarily limited to \n22  a.  interpreting or responding to bizarre or aberrant behaviors, \n23  b.  recognizing and responding to indications of suicidal thoughts, \n24  c.  proper suicide observation, \n25 \n16 Id. at 18.  _  -\n26  17 Merrick Bobb, supra note 2; at 17.  -\n18 Memorandum of Agr~ement Between the United States and Los Angeles County, \n27  California Regarding Mental Health Services at the Los Angeles County Jail. \nJd.  -\n19 \n28  !d. \n20 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \n-11-\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 13 of 83   Page ID #:925\n1  d.  recognizing common side effects of psychotropic medications, \n2  e.  professional and humane treatment of mentally ill inmates, arid \n3  .response to mental health crises including suicide intervention \n4  and cell extractions.\" \n5  31.  ·  In November 2004, Special Counsel Merrick Bobb presented to \n6  SheriffBaca and the Board of SuperVisors a confidential report fmding that \"Los \n7  Angeles County's largest jail is so outdated, understaffed and riddled with security \n8  flaws that it jeopardizes the lives of guards and inmates.\"21  The report concluded \n9  that Men's Central Jail suffers from \"lax supervision and a long-standing jail \n10  culture that has shortchanged accountability for inmate safety and security.\"22 \n11  32.  In his nineteenth Semiannual Report, dated February 2005, \n12  Special Counsel Merrick Bobb noted: \n13  From  the  Kolts  Report  onward,  there  has  been  a \n14  paradoxical  cont;radiction  between  Internal  Affairs \n15  investigations  that exonerated the  officer  and  litigation \n16  arising  out  of the  same  incident  that  cost the  County · \n17  substantial money in settlement  and judgments.

In his report· \n. 6  Dr. ~upers made a number of conclusions including:  \"[A]t theLos Angeles \n7  County Jail the claims by prisoners [of abuse by deputies] are so widespread, and \n8 .  the reports of abuse so consistent among multiple reporters, that jt seems very likely \n9  there is an unacceptably high incidence of custodial abuse.  Multiple prisoners have \n10 ·  told me about abuse they have undergone or witnessed, and most say it is \n11  disproportionately directed at prisoners with serious mental illness.\"25  Dr. Kupers \n12  also opined that the problem \"is made worse by inappropriate un-diagnosing and· \n13  consignment of prisoners suffering from serious mental illness to general \n14  population housing. \"26  Dr. Kupers further found that \"there seems to be very little \n15  . mental health training for most other officers, and given the fact that officers work \n16  over-time in most as.signments, this means that prisoners with mental illness outside \n17  .of Tower 1 are often guarded by officers wjth little or no training in mental \n18  health.\"27  He aJso found \"disturbing evidence of custodial abuse of prisoners with \n19  serious mental illness,\" ari.d \"crowding and idleness at every level[] further \n· 20  exacerbate the problems.\"28 \n21  34.

In April2010, a Los Angeles County Sheriffs deputy, Joshua \n7  Sather, who had graduated at the top of his recruit class, resigned after only a Jew \n8  weeks on the job, alleging that a supervisor made him beat up a mentally ill jail \n9  inmate . .S  ather was the sole Honor Recruit in his graduating -class from the \n10  academy, and had been-recognized for his leadership and other abilities.  As with \n11  virtually all rookies, his first assignment was jail duty.  On March 22, 2010, Sather \n12  was working on the sixth floor mental health ward ofTwin Towers.  At some point \n13  during Sather's shift, he, his supervisor and other deputies used force on a mentally \n14  ill inmate.  Soon afterward, Sather, crying and distraught, called his uncle, a veteran \n15  Sheriff's detective, and told him that he had. participated in an unjustified beating, \n16  that shortly before the beating his supervisor said, \"We're gohna go in and teach \n17  this guy a lesson,\" and that the attack had been covered up.  Sather's uncle \n30 \n18  confronted the supervisor about making his nephew \"beat up 'dings.\"' Sheriff's \n19  officials launched an investigation and determined that an.uncooperative inmate. \n20  had been subdue_d by force~ but concluded that no misconduct had occurred. \n21  36.  In May 2010, the ACLU National Prison Project and the ACLU \n22  of Southern California submitted to SheriffBaca and to the Rutherford Court the \n23  ACLU's \"Annual Report on Conditions Inside Los Angeles County Jail - 2008-\n24  2009.\"31  The report included declarations documenting scores of complaints fr~m. \n25  29 Jd. at 49. ·  .  . \n30  L.4. \nRobert Faturechi,  County Dep_uty Says He Was Forced to Beat Mentally El \n26\" \nInmate, Los Angeles TunesiOct. 7, 2011.  .  .  .  .  . \n31 \nMary Tiedeman & Daniel Bailon, ACLU National Prison Project & ACLU. of \n27  Southern  Annual Report on Conditions Inside Los Angeles County Jail-\nCalif01nia~ \n2008-2009 (May 5, 2010)~ filed in Rutherford v.

The report also \n3  documented a persistent pattern of retaliation and threats of retaliation by deputies \n4  against inmates who protested the conditions of their confmement. \n5  37.  In September 2010, the ACLU National Prison Project and the \n6  ACLU of Southern California sub:mitted to SheriffBaca and filed with the · \n7.  Rutherford Court the ACLU's \"Interim Report on Conditions in the Los Angeles \n8  County Jails.\"32  That report stated: \n9  The ACLU's 2009 Annual Report describes the pervasive \n10  pattern of violence that we observed in Men's Central Jail \n11  (MCJ) in 2009.  During the first eight months of2010, the \n12  violence  has  continued  unabated.  One  aspect  of the \n13  violence we discussed in our 2009 report was deputies' \n14  use of excessive and unjustified force, which continues to \n15  date:  in the five-month period 'from  March 10 through \n16  August 10, 2010, we received more than 70 complaints of \n17  excessive  and/o  r  unjustified  force,  or  retaliation  by \n18  deputies  against  prisoners,  or  both.  Twenty  of  the \n19  . prisoners making these complaints have provided  with \nW3 \n20  sworn written statements.33 \n21  38.  In December 2010, the media reported on a large-scale brawl at \n22  an LASD Christmas party at a  hall in Montebello.  The brawl was between \nbanque~ \n23  members of the 3000 Boys (the deputy gang discussed above in Paragraph 8) and \n·24  other deputies who worked in Men's Central Jail.

It wasn't their unit.  It was \n4  their friendship and their drinking. ''34 \n5  39.  The OIR, however, disagreed, stating, \"Perhaps most concerning \n6  is the evidence that jail supervisors apparently lmew about the use of 'gang-like' \n7  signs and other troubling behavior well before the eruption of violence at the \n8  Christmas party .\"35 \n9  40.  On September 25,·2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \n10  FBI was conducting a criminal investigation into deputy abuse at the Jails.36\n· \n11  41.  On September 28, 2011, the ACLU filed an Annual Report in \n12  . Rutherford v. Baca, reporting seventy cases of extreme deputy abuse in the \n13  previous year, including accountS by civilian eyewitnesses of savage deputy \n14  beatings of inmates in the Jails. 37 \n15  42.  On October 13, 2011, the OIR issued a report stating that the \n16  Sheriffs Department has failed over many years to follow through on proposals to \n17  address violence in the Jails. 38 \n18  43.  ·In eaily December 2011, Robert Olmsted, a retired top LASD \n19  official who had been the Captain in charge ofMen's Central Jail before being \n20  promoted to Commander in the LASD's Custody Division, and who oversaw both \n21  Men's Central Jail and  Towers, publicly disclosed that SheriffBaca and other \nTw~n \n22  senior Department staff, including Tanaka and Bums, have long had actual \n23 \n34 KTLA Special Report: The Gang Behind the Badge?

Olmsted had \n· 2  repeatedly informed Baca, Tanaka, and Burns of such problems, and tried to raise \n3 .  red flags about shoddy investigations that allowed deputies to escape scrutiny for \n4  . using force.  Olmsted had also voiced concerns to them about deputies forming \n5  gang-like aggressive clig_ues.  Chief Bums told Olmsted that it was impossible to \n. 6  change the deputy culture in Men's Central Jail.

See Paragraphs 194 - 200, for further discussion of Olmsted and his \n9  perspective on the problems in the Jails. \n10  44.  On January 10, 2012 SheriffBaca testified to the Board of \n11  Supervisors that use of force often arises when inmates have been declassified from \n12  mental health housing in TTCF Tower 1 to be returned to Men's Central Jail.  This \n13  practice of improperly declassifying mentally ill inmates from mental health \n14  housing in Tower 1 and placing them in general population in MCJ is one that · \n15  Dr. Kupers identified almost four years earlier as resulting in the abuse of mentally \n16  ill inmates. \n17  45.  On January 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \n18  Sheriff's Department had admitted that use of force against inmates in the Los \n19  Angeles County jails was disproportionately directed at inmates with mental illriess. \n20  \"Los Angeles County jailers are more likely to use .force against mentally ill  · \n21  inmates than other prisoners, according to a new Sheriff's Department report that \n22  acknowledges the lockups rieed specially trained staff to reduce the violence.\"39 \n23  This admission comes almost four years after Dr. Kupers concluded that deputy on \n· 24  inmate abuse was disproportionately directed at mentally ill inmates, that deputies \n25  lacked proper training in dealing with the mentally ill, and recommended that \"[a]ll \n26 \n27 \n39 Jack Leonard & Robert Faturechi, L.A.

Representative Examples Of Deputy Violence Against Inmates \n10  47.  Degrading, cruel, and sadistic deputy attacks on inmates are not \n11  isolated incidents at the Jails; they are commonplace.  Time and again, numerous \n12 ·  deputies attack one inmate.  Even .as the inmate lies motionless on the ground, new . \n13  deputies are summoned by radio and join in the attack.  In the course of a beating, it \n14  is a common practice for deputies to yell \"Stop fighting!\" or \"Stop resisting!\" to an \n15- inmate who is neither fighting nor resisting.  This practice is an effort to fabricate a \n. 16  reason to blame the inmates for the attacks. \n17  a. \n18  48.  On September 24, 2011, Mr. A was lying down on the floor of \n19  his pod in Twin Towers suffering frorri a migraine headache and vertigo.

Deputy Alatorre pulled down Mr. A's pants below the \n3  buttocks and verbally taunted him, while Deputy Ewell sat on Mr. A's legs right \n4  below his exposed buttocks.  Deputy Alatorre pushed Mr. A's face against the wall, \n5  hitting his forehead, and then placed Mr. A in a stress position for several minutes \n6  by pushing his knee or boot into Mr. A's back.  Although Mr. A was still suffering \n7  from the migraine and vertigo, in addition to an injured back and an arm that felt \n8  like it was broken, the deputies waved off medical staff from helping Mr. A. \n9  50.  One day later, Mr. A was given twenty-five days in disciplinary \n10  segregation as a result of the. incident.  Mr. A was 48 years old at the time of the \n11  beating. \n12  b.

In July 2011, when Macario Garcia was housed in Men's \n14  Central Jail, Deputy Chavez came to his cell and told him to get up because he had \n15  an appointment with an eye doctor. Deputy Chavez handcuffed him from behind \n16  and then escorted Mr. Garcia out, ofhis cell.  Deputy Wiener was standing inside \n17  the gated deputy's control booth next to the cell door controls. \n18  52.

One deputy shoved Mr. Johnson's \n9  head against the wall, while two others begari. punching him in the torso, knocking \n10  the wind out of him.  The deputies then took Mr. Johnson to an area where other \n11  inmates were ·handing out bedding and ordered him to help.

In the hallway, Deputy Navarro ordered Mr. Jones to strip \n23  naked and bend over.  Deputy Navarro yelled that this was his floor, and he would \n24  do whatever he wanted.  Deputy Navarro shone his flashlight at Mr. Jones's rear \n25  and another deputy put his finger in Mr. Jones's anus, as other deputies looked on \n26  and laughed.

Deputy Assaults Against Inmates For Rules Infractions Or \n2  Perceived Slights \n3  126.  Deputies often beat inmates for minor rules infractions or \n- 4  perceived.$lights.

First, \n6  Deputy Jackson kicked Mr. Griscavage and contorted his shoulders in a manner that \n-7  :caused him pain.  Deputy Jackson then handcuffed Mr. Griscavage and led him \n8  .a way from the pod.  Shortly thereafter an eyewitness saw a deputy push Mr. · \n9  Griscavage causing him to fall down.  Then at least four deputies began to beat him. \n10  The deputies knocked Mr. Griscavage unconscious, and he woke up in the hospital \n11  with severe lacerations, a broken nose, a chipped tooth, and bruises on his head. \n12  Three days later, deputies moved Mr. Griscavage to' the disciplinary segregation \n13  uriit for alleged  on a deputy.\" \n'~assault \n14  127.

One deputy stomped on Mr. Mannings's hand with his boot, \n20  shattering his knuclde .. The deputies repeatedly kicked Mr. Mannings' s body while \n21  yelling, \"Stop resisting,\" even though he was not resisting in any way.  The _ \n22 ·  deputies handcuffed Mr. Mannings and continued to kick his-body and face.

Deputies' Use Of Inmates As Pawns To Inflict Violence On Other \n4  Inmates \n5  128.  Deputies regularly pit inmates against other inmates, using them \n· 6 ·  as pawns to carry out acts of violence.  Deputies sometimes instigate violence \n7  between inmates by allowing inmates from rival garigs to have physical access to \n8  each other (for example, by opening up their cell doors from the deputy control \n9  booth), or by fomenting discord (for example, by mentioning an inmate's gang \n1 0  affiliation to inmates from a rival gang, or stating in front of other inmates that an \n11  inmate is a sex offender). \n12  129.  In March 2011, four inmates beat and sexually assaulted another \n13  inmate after an LASD custody assistant opened the door to the victim's cell.  The \n14 ·  controls to open cell doors are located inside a locked control booth accessible only \n15  to deputies and custody assistants.  After the cell door was opened, two inmates \n16 .  went inside and began punching the victim.  An inmate witness heard the victim \nan \n17  screaming for several ininutes.  Later that evening, the witness heard  inmate say \n18  that the victim was going to be sexually assaulted with a broomstick. The victim's \n19  cell door was once again opened and four inmates entered, one of them carrying a \n20  broomstick.  The witness heard the victim screaming and saw a broomstick handle \n21  with blood on it sticking out of the cell.  Later, the witness saw the ~ictim being \n22  esc01ied away fron1: the cell by a deputy; there was a large amount of blood on the \n23  victim's pants.  · \n24  130.  Deputies in Men's Central Jail allowed other inmates to assault \n25  Donald Shorts.  Mr. Shorts is a former gang member and was frequently the target \n26  of assaults from members of his former gang.  In June 2010, two inmates who were \n27  housed in a different module approached Mr. Shorts's cell.  The only way they \n28  C<?uld have appe·ared at this cell is if deputies opened the gates.· One of the inmates \n-41- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 43 of 83   Page ID #:955\n·1  then yelled to the deputies to open Mr. Shorts's cell door.  The deputies complied, \n2  and the two inmates entered the cell and assaulted Mr. Shorts, beating him with \n3  their fists and cutting his face and chest with a shank (a homemade knife).  The next \n4  day, deputies charged Mr. Shorts with possession of a shank, fighting, and \n5  insubordination to staff. \n6  131.  In March 2011, a deputy marched Jeremiah Wilkerson past \n7  members of a rival gang, telling them, \"This is a Norteno.  If the door's 'racked' \n8  [opened] you know what to do.\"  Mr. Wilkerson believed the deputy was trying to \n9  make him a target for an attack in retaliation for an earlier altercation. \n10  132.  Cameron Saul, a former inmate who now works as a drug \n11  treatment counselor, served as a \"house mouse\" (a liaison between inmates and \n12  deputies) for part of his time in Men's Central Jail, and reported to the deputies \n13  about inmates who were causing problems.  On several occasions, deputies told \n14  Mr. Saul that\" inmates should \"handle the problem,\" and that Mr. Saul should line \n15  up at least two inmates to say that the problem-causing inmate had \"slipped in the \n16  shower,\" in case that inmate complained following the attack.  Mr. Saul later \n17  witnessed other inmates take so-called problem inmates to the back of the module \n18  and attack them, without deputies intervening to prevent the attack. \n19  133.  A deputy placed Mr. T, an inmate who had been in protective \n20  custody, in the general population tank; where he was viciously attacked by other \n21  inmates.  Mr. T suffered contusions on his head, a busted lip, blurry vision, .a \n22  swollen ear, ·and severe ervotional trauma. \n23  134.  Michael Topete heard someone yelling, \"Help, they're killing \n· 24  me.!\" while someone else was yelling \"Shut the fuck up!\"  The next morning, \n25  Mr.· Topete heard other inmates say, \"They killed the rapist.\"  In an unrelated \n26  incident; deputies placed Mr. Topete, who had previously been in protective \n27  . custody, in the general population, where he was attacked by other inmates. \n28 \n.  -42- FIRST .AiviENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 44 of 83   Page ID #:956\n1  135.  On several occasions, deputies placed Rodolpho Mendoza, who \n2  was in protective custody, with inmates from the general population, who attacked \n3  him. \n4  136.  In 2009, Therin McGuire witnessed deputies ordering two \n5  inmates to beat up a third inmate in MCJ. \n6  H.  Even Civilians Have Witnessed Deputy Violence Against Inmates \n7  137.  Unchecked deputy-on-inmate violence in Men's Central Jail and.  \n.8   Twin Towers has become so pervasive and routine in recent  that deputies \ny~ars \n9  carry out savage attacks even in the presence of civilian eye witnesses.  Thomas \n10  Parker, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field \n11  Office noted that the phenomenon of deputies beating inmates in areas visible to \n12  civilians suggests that \"the culture of deputy violence in the Jails has become so \n13  hardened and pervasive that deputies feel emboldened to carry out their attacks \n14  even in non~secluded areas.\" \n15  13 8.  In February 2009, Jails Chaplain Paulino Juarez witnessed a \n16  beating on the 3000 floor in Men's Central Jail.  Chaplain Juarez was visiting \n17  ·inmates as part ofhis ministry, when he heard the sounds of someone being beaten. \n18  When he walked towards the noises, he saw three deputies, including Deputies \n19  Ramirez and Aguilar, in a hallway pounding the face and body of an inmate who \n20  stood with his back to the wall.  The inmate appeared to be handcuffed; he was \n21  neither raising his hands to protect himself,:n  or resisting in any way. The deputies \n22  punched the inmate until he collapsed face-first on the ground, at which point they· \n23  began kicking him in the head and body.  Until this point, the inmate had implored \n24  . the deputies to stop.  On the ground, he fell silent.  Though the inmate was \n25  apparently unconscious, deputies continued to punch and kick him, and yelled, \n26  \"Stop fightmg!\" \n27  139.  A deputy fmally noticed that Chaplain Juarez was watching the \n28  attack and made signs to the others to stop the beating. But a call had gone out to \n-43- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 45 of 83   Page ID #:957\n1  other deputies to join in the attack, and two more· deputies entered the hallway and \n2  began to kick the motionless inmate.  One deputy stomped on the inmate's back. \n3  Those deputies who had noticed Chaplain Juarez motioned to the other deputies to \n4  alert them to his presence. \n5  140.  ·At the end of the beating there was a puddle ofblood some two \n6  feet in diameter around the inmate's head.  Chaplain Juarez was overwhelmed with \n7  ·fear, worried deputies would harm him.  Several eyed him in a threatening way. \n8  Some said \"rat\" and \"motherfucker\" when he passed them in the jail over the next \n9  few days. · \n10  141. · Chaplain Juarez wrote a detailed report of the incident, which he \n11  gave to a sergeant and his supervisor at the archdiocese, and he was interviewed by \n12  the LASD.  Two years passed before he heard anything from the LASD about .the \n13  beating.  In a June 2011 meeting among employees ofthe archdiocese and \n14  personnel from OIR, Chaplain Juarez was told that the case had been resolved \n15  internally, and that news of the beating had never reached Sheriff Baca.  After the \n16  meeting with 0~ a representative of SheriffBaca's office contacted the Catholic \n17  chaplains to set up a meeting with the Sheriff. \n18  142.  In July 2011, SheriffBaca told. Chaplain Juarez that the detailed \n19  report Chaplain Juarez had written and delivered to the LASD was not included in \n20  the LASD's file on the incident.  The file that SheriffBaca read aloud from \n21  described Chaplain Jwirez· as \"exaggerating\" the details of the beating.  The \n22  description of the attack in the LASD file from which Sheriff Baca read aloud \n23  seemed to describe a totally different incident from the one Chaplain Juarez had \n24  . witnessed:  the file said the inmate was schizophrenic and that deputies had to strike \n25  him a few times with their fists to get him into his cell.  SheriffBaca seemed \n26  v.nconcemed, stating simply that \"punches are allowed but kicks are not a:llowed in \n27  my department.\" \n28 \n-44- F~STAMffiNDEDCO~LMNTFOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 46 of 83   Page ID #:958\n1  143.  In.February 2011, another Jail Chaplain, Chaplain Doe, was \n2  wallcing towards the chaplain's office on the third floor of Men's Central Jail, when \n3  he saw four or five deputies repeatedly kicking an inmate.  The inmate lay \n4  motionless, face-down on the ground. His hands appeared to be tucked behind his \n5  back, where they remained throughout the attack.  The inmate pleaded with the \n6  deputies to stop, yelling, \"Help me!\"  After the deputies continuousiy kicked the \n7  inmate for between two and three minutes, the deputies ordered Chaplain Doe to \n8  . leave the scene.  Chaplain Doe was afraid that if he tried to stop the beating or even \n9  asked the deputies to stop, they would hurt him.  Although Chaplain Doe could no . \n10  longer see the beating at this point, he could still hear the \"thumping\" sounds of the \n11  deputies kicking the inmate, and the inmate's cries for help.  Eventually the inmate \n12  fell silent but the kicks continued for about another minute.  Neither LASD nor the \n13  OIR ever questioned Chaplain Doe about the incident, even though a sergeant\" and \n14  numerous deputies were aware that he was an eyewitness to the beating. \n15  144.  On January 24, 2011, Esther Lirri, the ACLU Jails Project \n16 .  Coordinator, witnessed the savage beating of an immobile, seemingly unconscious \n17  inmate in Twin Towers.  At the time, Ms. Lim was meeting with another inmate in \n18  the facility's attorney room.  When.she heard whatsounded like a fight in the \n19  Staging Area, she·l ooked through the windows dividing-the attorney room and the \n20  Staging Area and saw the attack in progress.  Deputies Ochoa and Hirsch \n21  · repeatedly punched and kneed an inmate who lay face-down and inert on the floor. \n22  The inmate was so still that Ms. Lim thought he looked like \"a mannequin that was \n23  being used as a punching bag.\"  But the deputies persisted in their attack, with one \n24  of them shocking the inmate again and again with a taser gun.  Although the inmate \n25  never moved from his spot on the ground, the deputies repeatedly yelled, \"Stop· \n26  fighting!\" and \"Stop resisting!\" \n27 \n28 \n-45- FIRST AJMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 47 of 83   Page ID #:959\n1  145.  Scott Budnick, a civilian volunteer who mentors young inmates,. \n2  witnessed five deputy-on-inmate beatings at Men's Central Jail over a three-year \n3  period. \n4  146.  In early 2007, Mr. Budnick witnessed an incident in which \n5  approximately seven deputies used a taser grm repeatedly on an inmate who was \n6  lying on the grormd motionless.  When Mr. Budnick told a deputy what he had \n7  seen, the deputy replied, \"Yeah, we fuck these guys up all the time.\" \n8  147.  In 2008, while Mr. Budnick waited outside the classroom where \n9  he taught inmates, he saw a deputy pull an inmate out of a line, strip search him in \n10  full view of numerous people, and then smash his head into the wall with such force \n11  that Mr. Budnick heard a loud crack.  The inmate had not attacked or threatened the \n12  deputy in any way before the attack. \n13  148.  ·In December 2008, again while standing outside his classroom, \n14  Mr. Budnick saw three deputies stop and strip search an inmate who was walking. \n15  down the hall.  The deputies forcefully twisted the inmate's arm behind his back \n16  and shoved him to the ground.  The inmate had not attacked or threatened the \n17.  deputies in any way. \n18  149.  In or about July 2009, Mr. Budnick saw several deputies tarmt \n19  . an inmate who asked them for directions to the inmate's mo.dule.  The ·deputies then \n20  twisted the inmate's aim behind his back, grabbed the inmate's head and put it \n21  against the wall, and then pushed the inmate's face into the wall. \n22  150.  In 2009, Mr. Budnick witnessed three deputies kicking and \n23  punching an inmate.  When the inmate fell down, the deputies continued attacking \n· 24  him while he lay on the floor.  The deputies repeatedly yelled \"Stop resisting!\"-\n25  even though Mr. Budnick could seethatthe inmate was not moving, much less \n26  resisting. \n27  151.  Several chaplains cautioned Mr. Budnick not to report one \n28  incident of abuse that he witnessed, telling him that if he reported the incident, he \nFffiSTAMENDEDCOMYLNNTFOR \n-46-\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 48 of 83   Page ID #:960\n1  would no longer be allowed to volunteer.  The chaplains said that they refrained \n· 2  . from reporting incidents ofabuse out of fear of losing their jobs.  Several civilians \n.3  also said that they were afraid to intervene in the deputy-on-inmate attacks they \n4  witnessed, for fear if they tried to stop the attacks, deputies would assault them. \n5  152.  Mr. Budnick did report the July 2009 incident to Sergeant \n6  Renfro, who promised to \"get into this immediately.\"  Mr. Budnick, however, was \n7  never interviewed about what he had observed.  He never heard back from the \n8  sergeant, or anyone else at the LASD or OIR, about an investigation into his \n.9  allegations of deputy violence. \n10  I.  The Pattern OfDeputv-On-Inmate Violence In The Jails Has Been \n.  . \n11  Ongoing For At Least A Dozen Years \n12  153.  In July 2009, after Phillip Westby got into an argument with \n13  another inmate in Twin Towers, deputies pulled him out of his c.ell and slammed · \n14  his head into the wall.  Deputy O'Hardy handcuffed Mr. Westby and then ·slammed \n15  his head into the wall two more times.  Deputies O'Hardy and Sandoval then led \n16  Mr. Westby into the Outdoor Recreation area where they repeatedly punched him in \n17  the·head, neck, and back, and then threw him to the ground.  Mr: Westby worried \n18  that his ribs were broken, but did not seek medical help because he feared \n19  retaliation from the deputi-es.  It took Mr. Westby's bruises almost two weeks to \n20  heal. \n21  154.  In October 2008., Deputy Cinderelli.handcuffed Drequinn \n22  Johnson to transport him to al~gal visit.  Deputy Cinderelli stopped Mr. Johnson in \n· 23  the hallway, near Deputy Grant, who was considered a \"rookie\" deputy.  Deputy \n24  Cinderelli said to Deputy Grant, \"This is training, this is when you get your first \n25  force,\" meaning his first use of force incident.  Deputy Cinderelli then shoved \n26  Mr. Johnson against the wall and began punching him.  Mr. Johnson, who was still \n2 7  handcuffed, fell to the ground, and Deputy Grant joined Deputy Cinderelli in \n28  punching and kicking him.  .Two other deputies came over and joined the melee. \n-47- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 49 of 83   Page ID #:961\n1  The deputies shot Mr. Johnson with ataser twice in the arm.  After the incident, \n2  Mr. Johnson was unable to see out of his left eye for about two weeks.  When . \n3  ·deputies interviewed Mr. Johnson about the incident, he said he did not remember \n4  what had happened, because he was afraid the deputies would hurt him again. \n5  155.  In February 2008, after Peter Johnson, who uses a wheelchair, \n6  complained about jail conditions, Deputies Ochoa, Reynoso, and Saldivar pulled \n7  him off his bed and kicked and kneed his ribs, back, and neck.  The deputies later \n8  shot pepper spray into Mr. Johnson's face and caused him to fall out of his \n9  wheelchair.  The assault occurred in the wheelchair module in Men's Central Jail. \n10  156.  On or about December 30, 2007, a deputy repeatedly slammed \n11  Robert Powell's head into the wall, scratching and bruising his forehead; and left \n12  him outside in the cold.  At the time, Mr. Powell was 58 years old. \n13  157.  In June 2006, a deputy assaulted ami raped Frank Mendoza, a \n14  gay inmate,. in Twin Towers.  Earlier in the day, the same deputy was escorting a · \n15  line of inmates including Mr. Mendoza and said to.them \"you all walk like girls.\" \n16  When Mr. Mendoza said to another inmate in the line, \"There's a male who's \n· 17  unsure of his masculinity,\" the deputy grabbed Mr. Mendoza, shoved him against \n18  the wall, and threatened him stating, \"You better watch it.  I will show you my \n19  masculinity.  I will come get you.\"  Later that day, when the inillates returned to \n20  their pod, Mr. Mendoza's cell door was left open.  Shortly after the deputy in the \n21  tower outside the pod left his post, the deputy who had previously threatened \n22  Mr. Mendoza forced him into his cell, tore off his clothes, threw him to the ground, \n23 .  shoved a gag in his mouth and raped him.  After the rape was over, Mr. Mendoza \n24  lay shivering and naked in his cell until another deputy found him and asked what \n25  had happened.  After Mr. Mendoza reported that he had been raped, the deputy \n26  responded, \"I do not see anything wrong with you.\"  No LASD personnel · \n27  interviewed Mr. Mendoza about the incident or took any forensic evidence to \n28  investigate whether he had been raped.  Mr. Mendoza had been arrested for public \n-48- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 50 of 83   Page ID #:962\n1  drunkenness and was being held in LA County jail on a warrant for failure to \n2  appear that later proved to have been issued in error. \n3  158.

On October 10, 2003, he was \n5  in jail on a charge that ultimately resulted in a reversed conviction.  Mi. Rocha was . \n6  in a holding cell being processed for entry into the jail, when he observed a man in \n7  · his late 50's or early 60's, who appeared .to be mentally ill, on his hands and knees. \n8  Mr. Rocha saw a deputy race over, kick the man in the head, and start punching \n9  him.  Almost immediately, about four or five other deputies came over and joined \n10  in the assault, punching, stomping, and kicking the man while he lay on his \n11  stoinach·on the floor, not resisting and not even trying to shield himself from the \n. 12  deputies' blows.  The assault left the man bleeding from his face and the top ofhis \n13  head, with one of his eyes swollen shut. \n14  J.  Victims Of Deputy Abuse Experience Intimidation And \n15  Retaliation \n16  159.  There is a widespread fear among inmates at Men's Central Jail \n17  and Twin Towers of reporting deputy misdeeds to the ACLU, or anyone else, . \n18  because deputies regularly retaliate against those who lodge complaints.  When \n19  inmates complain about mistreatment, deputies respond with punishment:  strip \n20  searches, body cavity searches, destructive cell shake-downs, confiscation of their \n21  belongings, or solitary confinement.  If inmates complain of being beaten, the . \n22  Sheriffs Department will likely bring false disciplinary charges against them for \n23  assault against the deputies who beat them, and in some cases hand them over for \n24  criminal prosecution on the bogus charges. \n25'  160.  In March 2011, after Mr. U told a nurse that a deputy had earlier \n26  refused to take him to his medical appointment, the deputy said to Mr. U, \"I can \n. 27  make it that you slip in the shower next time and need serious medical attention.\" \n28 \n-49- FIRST AMENDED COM:PLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 51 of 83   Page ID #:963\n1  161.  In January 2011, two deputies verbally and physically assaulted \n2  Shawn Meyers in an elevator for his interactions with ACLU representatives.  The \n3  deputies slammed Mr. Meyers, who uses a wheelchair, against the wall, and said, \n4  \"That's your warnirig.'' \n5  162.  In January 2011, Deputy Carbajal overheard inmate Mani Sadri \n6  complain about being threatened by another deputy.  Deputy Carbajal warned \n7  Mr. Sadri not to complain any more to ACLU, and threatened to have other inmates \n8  kill him.  Deputy Carbajal said, \"Don't complain to anyone if you want to make it . \n9  out ofhere alive.\" \n10  163. ' In November and December 2010, in.the Twin Towers, deputies \n11  repeatedly threatened Mr. V, whose criminal case had received extensive media \n12  coverage . .O  n one occasion, a module officer refused to give Mr. Va blanket, \n13  saying he. did not \"give them to murderers.\"  Another deputy told him, \"[S]o you're \n14  [Mr. V].  I can't wait to get you to my floor.\"  When Mr. V was transferred to \n15  Men's Central Jail, Deputies Ibarra and another deputy repeatedly asked him what · \n16  he was in jail for, and punched his ribs lintil he answered.  They called Mr. V a \n17  \"piece of shit,\" told him he would not receive basic necessities such as food, and \n18  said they would tum him over \"to the Southsiders,\" which Mr. V understood as a \n19  threat to tum: him over to the Southsiders gang.  Deputy Ibarra told him not to \n20  complain about the incident, or the deputy would \"go in your cell and beat you up \n21 \npersonally~\" \n22  164.  In June 2010, after Robert Dragusica spoke with the ACLU \n. 23  about violence inside Men's Central Jail, deputies began threatening and \n24  intimidating him.  The behavior of the deputies caused Mr. Dragusica to refuse two \n25  opportunities to speak with the ACLU again, because he was scared of what the \n26  deputies might do.  After eventually speaking with the ACLU a second time, \n27  deputies sent Mr. Dragusica to disciplinary segregation for a fabricated contraband \n28  charge. \n-50- FIRST AMENDED C011PLAJNTFOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 52 of 83   Page ID #:964\n1  165.  Deputies sent another inmate to beat  Benson in \nEmrnanu~l \n2  May 2009, after he reported that a guard had assaulted him the day before. A \n3  deputy opened the door to Mr. Benson's cell in Men's Central Jail and allowed the \n4  other inmate to enter.  The inmate punched Mr. Benson twice in the face and told \n5  him he was sent because Mr. Benson reported the deputy's attack.  Mr. Benson did \n6  -not request medical treatment in fear of further retaliation. \n7  166.  In March 2009, deputies severely beat Daysuan Rushing in \n8  retaliation for his speaking to the ACLU.  After Mr. Rushing spoke with an ACLU \n9  representative who visited his row, deputies delayed him as he returned from a \n10    court appearance.  Mr. Rushing, who was restrained in waistchains, was forced up \n11  against a wall with his legs spread.  Deputy Zuniga slapped the back of his head \n12  twice and then kicked Mr. Rushing's leg, causing him to fall to th~ ground.  Deputy \n13- Zuniga and another officer began punching and kicking Mr. Rushing, and hit him \n14  repeatedly in the face and knees with a flashlight.  The deputies then pepper \n15  sprayed Mr. Rushing in the face and threw him down a flight of stairs.  While \n16  Mr. Rushing was laying on the ground bleeding, Deputy Zuniga said, \"You fucking \n17  whiners, tell this to the ACLU, I dare you.\"  As a result of the beating, Mr. Rushing \n18  received stitches on both sides of his face. \n19  167.  Deputies beat Mr. Win Men's Central Jail and he was \n20  subsequently refused pain medication that he.w  as supposed to receive, because he-\n21  had complained to the ACLU. \n22  168.  SheriffBaca and Chief Burns have long been aware of the \n23  Department's practice of retaliating against inmates, including a pattern of arresting \n24  the victims of staff beatings and initiating their prosecution for assault, without any . \n25  meaningful internal-investigation ofthe facts surrounding the incident.  In 2010, the \n26  ACLU filed in Rutherford a motion for a protective order asking that Defendant and \n27  his agents be enjoined from retaliating against inmates for speaking with the \n28  ACLU. _That motion was accompanied by  declarations attesting to \nn~merous \n-51- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 53 of 83   Page ID #:965\n1  incidents of retallation, including retaliation in the form of physical abuse.  Despite \n2  this knowledge, Defendant and other high ranking officials at the Department have \n3  denied that retaliation is· a significant problem and have failed to adequately \n4  investigate the problem .. Instead, they have tolerated and encouraged staff to \n5  continue to arrest and request prosecution of inmates beaten in the jails.  Their \n6 ·  continued acquiescence.i n this practice manifests deliberate indifference toward the \n7  rights of the Plaintiffs and all other inmates in the Jails. \n8  i69. ·In a November 2010 declaration, ChiefBurns made a \n9  categorical statement under oath that \"every allegation of retaliation\" that the \n10  ACLU had brought to LASD's attention that the Department had investigated \"has \n11  been determined to be without merit. ... [T]he Department takes allegations of \n12  retaliation and other deputy misconduct extremely seriously and such claims are \n13  always thoroughly investigated.\"42  On information and belief, this statement was \n14  false and Chief Burns lmew it was false at the time he made it. \n15  170.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that Undersheriff \n16  Tanaka is also aware of this pattern of retaliation. \n17  171.  In its October 2011 report, the OIR stated that expectations that \n18  custody personnel will not engage in retaliation and the use of excessive force is not \n19  \"consistently reinforced up the chain of command\": \n.. \n20  \"[T]he key to preventing questionable force incidents and \n21  ensuring the fair treatment of inmates is in the hands ·of \n22  line-level supervisors.

Supervisory Officials Have Condoned A Pattern Of Inadequate \n6  Investigations And Cover·-Ups \n7  172.  The LASD brushes aside most inmate reports of violence.  The \n8'  Department's apparent indifference to such complaints gives deputies a sense of \n9  unchecked autonomy in the way they perform their jobs.  Incidents of deputy-on-\n10    inmate violence, after nominal or no investigation by LASD, are routinely reported \n11  by deputies as an unprovoked inmate-on-deputy assault, and if an inmate complains \n12  of being beaten or injured by jail deputies, those complaints are almost universally \n13  declared unfounded.  Most of these complaints get \"resolved\" at the lowest levels in \n14  . the LASD.  Proper reporting procedures are routinely ignored. \n· 15  173.  Corrections expert Toni V. Bair reviewed the investigative \n16  procedures and policies of the Los Angeles County Jails and found them to be \n17  \"grossly substandard.\"44  For example, during the investigation ofUse ·of Force \n18  incidents the supervisor of the attacking deputies often interviews the inmate \n19·  victim, rather than an independent supervisor.45 \n20  174.  This practice is permitted hy LASD·policy, even though it is \n21  considered unacceptable and unprofessional by corrections experts. \n22 .  175.  Moreover, LASD sergeants and lieutenants often permit the very \n23  officers accused of assault to be present during the interview of the inmate for the \n24 ·  use of force investigation, a tactic that has the purpose and effect of intimidating the \n25  inmate and imp'acting his testimony.

Mr. Bair declared that \n2  this practice is \"unheard of in professionally conducted investigations and \n3  interviews,\" and stated that \"It is no wonder that the prisoner frequently ... alters \n4  his story so as not to implicate the officer(s) involved in the incident.\"46 \n5  17 6.  Even though permitting a deputy who was involved in a force \n_6   incident ·with an inmate to be present during the interview of the inmate is grossly \n7  unprofessional, LASD policy did not forbid this practice until the ACLU's 2011 \n8  report revealed how frequently involved deputies were present during inmate \n9  interviews. \n10  177.  The Los Angeles Times recently reported that according to an \n11  internal LASD memorandum, deputies were \"were crafting narratives 'dramatized \n12  to justify' force and delaying using weapons such as pepper spray that could end \n13  fights 'to dispense appropriate jailhouse justice. \"'47 \n14  178.  In 2011, a correctional expert in an inmate's excessive force \n15  case against Sheriff Baca noted-both false reports by deputies and the complete \n16  absence of an after-the-fact review of a serial cell extraction in Men's Central Jail, \n17  in which deputies injured a number ofinmates.48  The report stated, among other \n18  things,-that with respect to the deputies' documentation ofthe use of force, \"some \n19  crucial reports are missing, others are substantially incomplete and still other \n20  reports are inaccunite or false.\"49  In addition, the report stated:  \"One of the most \n21  disturbing aspects of this incident is that there was apparently not so much as a \n22  cursory review of the situation, let alone a serious investigation\" by supervisors of \n23 \n24 \n25  46 Jd. ,-r 16.  - - -\n47 Robert Faturechi &  Jack Leonard, SheriffB  aca Was Warned about Jail Pf!JJ.Uties \n26  Conduct, Retiree Says, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 1, 2011 [hereinafter Sheri.JJ Baca \nfras Warned].  · _ \n27  4  Expert Report of Jeffrey Schwartz, Feb. 8, 2011, filed in Ramirez v.

In its 2011 report, the OIR stated \"too often we have found\" that \n4  \"the investigations of force incidents that result in less serious or no apparent . \n5  injuries to the inmate\" are \"lackluster, sometimes slanted, and insufficiently \n6  thorough.,51 \n7  180.  Former FBI Executive Thomas Parker concluded that there are \nn \n8  \"systemic institutional actions to cover  up\" the longstanding pattern of unchecked \n9  deputy-on-inmate violence at the jails. \n10  181.  The institutional cover-ups often take the form of filing criminal \n11  charges against inmate victims o{deputy violence.  The odds are low of an inmate \n12  winning an acquittal against the sworn testimony of deputy witnesses.  A criminal \n13  conviction of the inmate for his ~'assault\" on the deputy- in reality, the deputy's \n14  · assault on the inmate - results in a complete immunization of the deputy assailants \n15  and the Department for from civil liability for the assault. \n16  182.  In January 2011, James Parker, an inmate whom ACLU Jails \n17  Project Coordinator Esther Lim witnessed being brutally beaten and tasered by \n18  Deputies Ochoa and Hirsch, was subsequently charged with battery against a peace \n19  officer and resisting a peace officer.  For additional examples of trumped-up \n20  charges filed against victims of deputy abuse, see, e.g., Paragraphs 51 - 57 \n21  (Macario Garcia), 112 (Mr. M), and 122 (Evan Tutt) above. \n22  183.  The Department has even charged visitors to the Jails in this \n23  fashion.  As discussed in Paragraph 66, Gabriel Carillo was assaulted by deputies \n24  while visiting his brother in Men's Central Jail in February 201 L  In April, 2001, \n25  he was charged with resisting and officer and battery. 2  The District Attorney later \n5\n26 \n50 Jd. at 20. \n27  51 Los Angeles County Office of Ind~endent Review, supra note 31, at 4. \n52 The People v.

In contrast, LASD frequentiy chooses not to forward tci the \n5  . District Attorney information about deputies who have been disciplined or even \n6  terminated for using excessive force against inmates.  As the Los Angeles Times \n7  reported:  \"In several cases in recent years, deputies who were disciplined or even \n· 8  fired for abusing inmates escaped criminal scrutiny ·because Sheriffs Department \n9  officials chose not to give the evidence to the district attorney's office, opting to. \n10  handle the cases internally.\"53 \n11  L.  Defendant Has Actual Knowledge Of Deputy Violence And Has \n12  Failed To Take Reasonable Measures To Avert It \n13  185.  Rampant violence at the Jails has resulted from a failure of \n14  leadership at the top level of the Department.  Such a pervasive, deeply-entrenched, \n15  and notorious pattern of excessive force could not have continued unabated over a \n16  period of many years without a code of silence .on the part of front-line and \n17  supervisory staff, combined with management staffs failure to require \n18  accountability, and thei:r;- engaging in outright cover-up.54 \n19  186.  ·Despite overwhelming evidence of the culture of deputy-on \n20  inmate violence, SheriffBaca, Undersheriff Tanaka, and ChiefBums have \n21  stubbornly refused.t o acknowledge the problem.  They and their spokespeople have \n22  publicly taken the position that victims' allegations have been investigated \n23  thoroughly and found to be false, and they have attacked the credibility of civilian \n24  witnesses to deputy violence.

Sheriff Baca has failed or refused to hold accountable high-\n8  ranking supervisors in the face of significant nonfeasance and malfeasance by these \n9  supervisors and by the officers they oversee.  Both Chief of Custody Operations \n10  Bums and Undersheriff Tanaka remain in the positions they held, or have been \n11  promoted, despite the epidemic of deputy on inmate abuse in the jails that Sheriff \n12  Baca is aware occurred over the past years. \n13  188.  With rare exception, deputies whose misconduct is brought to \n14  the attention of supervisory personnel continue to work With inmates in \n15  Department-operated jails without any substantial disciplinary (:lction being taken \n16  against them. \n17  189.  The fact that physical abuse by officers remains unchecked and \n18  unrestrained leads the staff to believe that inmates may be beaten with impunity. \n19  SheriffBaca's actions and omissions have created the perception among high-\n20  ranking supervisors in the Sheriffs Department that a supervisor who turns a blind \n21  eye towards evidence of staff misuse of force and fails to investigate incidents in \n22  which  are injured by staff will suffer no damage to his or her career. \n~ates· \n23  190.  In September 2011, the release ofthe ACLU's annual report on \n24  the Los Angeles County Jails, detailing some seventy recent instances of extreme \n25  deputy violence against inmates and other serious abuse of inmates, and press \n26  reports of an FBI probe involving deputy violence in the Jails, set off a media \n.. \n27  storm.  SheriffBaca.responded by dismissing ari.y possibility of a systemic problem, \n28 \n-57- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 59 of 83   Page ID #:971\n1  and with wildly inconsistent and self-serving statements about his lack of \n2  awareness of the problem. \n3  191.  SheriffBaca first flatly denied the existence ofa systemic \n4 · · problem.  Nicole Nishida, one of the sheriffs spokespersons, said that the \n5  department thoroughly investigated all complaints of abuse that it received and that \n6  most were unsubstantiated.5 5 \n7  192.  As public criticism ofSheriffBaca continued to mount, and new \n8  allegations surfaced, the Sheriff acknowledged there were widespread problem but \n9  claimed that he had not been aware of its .existence.  As reported on October 10, \n10  2011, Defendant Baca stated:  \"We are going to look into this and we welcome \n11  anyone to look ir).to it as well.\"  He contended that \"[t]he widespread problem can't \n.12  be defmed until. we know what all the is~ues are. \"56 \n13  193.  On October 16, 2011, the Sheriff told the Los Angeles Times that \n14  his command staff occasionally left him in the dark about the Jails' problems.  \"I \n15  wasn't ignoring the jails.  I just didn't know,\" Baca said.  \"People can say, 'What \n16  the hell kind of leader is that?' The truth is I should've known.  So now I do \n17  know.\" 57 \n18  194.  Finally, in early December 2011, it came to light that Sheriff \n19  Baca and other senior officials in LASD had in fact known of the pattern of \n20  widespread deputy violence in the Jails for years.  Robert Olmsted, a retired top \n21  LASD official with supervisory authority over Men's Central Jail, had repeatedly \n22  informed Sheriff Baca of such problems.

He \n8  also  voiced  concern about  deputies  forming  aggressive \n9  cliques. \n10  He alleged that two top officials rebuffed him, telling him \n11  it was  impossible  to change  the  deputy  culture  in  the \n12  downtown L.A. lockup, an antiquated-facility that houses \n13  some of the county's most dangerous inmates. \n14  Olmsted, a  32-year department veteran who retired late \n15  last year,  had commissioned  several  corifidential audits \n16  and  internal  memos  that  found  serious  problems  with \n17  excessive force and iri.adequate supervision in the jail.  He \n18  said top sheriff's officials seemed not to take his· concerns \n19  seriously. \n20 \n21  \"It's frustrating knowing that this never, ever needed to \n22  have occurred,\" Olmsted said.  \"There was a systematic \n23  failure of leadership.\" \n24 \n25  Olmsted said he twice  approached Baca to  discus-s  the \n. 26  problems at Men's Central Jail.  The first time was at _a \n27  department barbecue.  .Baca, he said, told him he would \n28  be in touch but never followed up.· \n-59- F~STAMENDEDCON.WLMNTFOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 61 of 83   Page ID #:973\n1  Months later, Olmsted said, he spoke to the sheriff at a \n2  charity food giveaway.  The event occurred soon after a \n3  group  of Men's  Ceritral  Jail  deputies  had been  caught \n4  fighting  each  other  at  an. off-duty,  department  holiday \n5  party.  After the brawl, sheriffs officials said some ofthe \n6  deputies  had  formed ·a  clique  whose  members  flashed \n7  gang-like hand signs. \n8  Olmsted said he told the sheriff he wanted to discuss how \n9  to  improve  supervision  at  the  jail  to  prevent  similar \n10  problems in the futu~e.  Baca, he said, agreed to talk but \n11  again never followed through.58 \n12  195.  Commander-Olmsted raised the issue ofunchecked violence not \n.  . \n13  only with Defendant Baca but also with Tana.k~: \n14  Bums, he  said, told him the jail's  culture could not be \n. 15  changed.  Frustrated, Olmsted said he took his concerns in \n16  the  summer  of  2010  to  Asst.  Sheriff  Marvin  0. \n: 17  Cavanaugh, who was sympathetic but told him the same \n18  thing.  He also spoke to then-Asst. Sheriff Paul Tanaka, \n19  who as undersheriff now runs the day-to-day operations \n20 .  of the department. 59 \n21  196.  Witness LA reported:  \"In a series of interviews with the LA \n22  Justice Report, Olmsted [stated]-... '[T]he real problem is how departmental \n23  leadership allowed this jail situation to occur.\"'  \"The problems inside the jail were \n24  ignored by the Sheriff's command staff.

Commander Olmsted also found, as early as 2009, that reported \n2  use of force was not being properly investigated and the official paperwork \n3  reporting incidents of deputy force at Men's Central Jail-the so-called \"use of \n4  force packets\" - ·were not being properly prepared: \n5  198.  Olmsted found that; not only were many force packages not \n6  being investigated, the-ones that were cleared were often given only cursory  · \n7  examination.  Ohnsted had one qfhis lieutenants pull30 force reports at random · \n8  that were in various stages of oversight.  A second lietenant [sic], Mark McCorkle, \n9  analyzed them.  All were either signed off on, or were on the verge of being \n10  cleared.  Yet of that group of30, 18 uses of force were questionable in nature and \n11  conceivably fell outside of department policy.61  Commander Ohnsted raised the \n12  issue of inadequate investigations of use of force with command staff, including \n13  Bums and Tanaka- all of whom ignored the issue.  Olmsted took McCorkle's \n14  finding regarding inadequate.,use of force investigations up the chain of command. \n15  to Custody Chief Dennis Bums, Assistant Sheriff in charge of custody, Marvin \n16  Cavanaugh, and Paul Tanaka.  No action was taken.62 \n17  \"19.9.  In response to these latest revelations from Commander \n18  Olmsted, SheriffBaca, rather than. accepting responsibility, publicly laid the blame \n19  on Commander Olmsted for not solving the problem.

According to Commander Olmsted, when he took the evidence \n8  of inadequate investigations of use of force incidents to Chief Bums, ChiefBums \n9  did not deny there was a problem, but told Olmsted that the jail's culture·could riot \n1 0  be changed. 65 \n11  201.  Despite their knowledge of the serious problem of improper and \n12  excessive use of force in the jails, Defendant and other high ranking officials at the \n13  Department have repeatedly failed to take reasonable steps to_a ddress the problem. \n14  202.  Defendant and other high railking officials at the Department \n15  have failed to put in place adequate policies governing use of force.  The \n16  Department's policies are grossly lacking in specificity about typical force \n17  scenarios that are likely to arise in the jails and the proper way for custody \n18  personnel to handle those situations. \n19  203.  The force policies rem:airi severely inadequate even after the few \n20  changes to force poliCies that the Defendant and other high ranking officials at the \n21  Department have implemented since the release of the ACLU's 2011 report. \n22  204 ..  The insufficiency of the force policies makes it almost \n23  impossible to train deputies adequately on the proper use of force. \n24  205.

Sheriff Baca, Undersheriff Tanaka, and Chief Bums have failed \n6  to implement a system for identifying, logging, and tracking incidents of use of \n7  force by deputies and complaints by inmates of use of force by deputies in the LA . \n8  County jail. \n9  207.  For the past five years, the Los Angeles Police Department has· \n10  had a computerized system, TEEMS II, capable of both tracking use of force \n11  information and providing early warning by identifying officers involved in \n12  multiple use of force incidents.  Even though LAPD and numerous other law \n13  enforcement agencies have such tracking and early warning systems, on \n14  information and belief, Defendant and the Department either have not designed \n15  their Facility Automated Tracking System (F.A.S.T.) or Personnel Performance \n16  Index to perform this function for deputies working in the Custody Division, or \n17  they have failed to obtain this information from orie or both systems, to reduce the \n18  number of incidents of excessive or unnecessary use of force in the Jails. Nor have \n19  they created a system that tracks inmate complaints about use off orce by deputies \n20  in the jails. \n21  208.  Bums·has been and is aware of the failures of the Department's \n.22  tracking systems.  When the ACLU sought a court order in 2010 requiring that \n23  complaints of retaliation, including identifying the officer(s) who are the subject of \n24  such allegations be tracked in F.A.S.T, Ch~efBurns submitted a sworn declaration \n25  to the Court stating, \"the FAST was not designed properly to track information \n26  about deputy misconduct.\" \n27 \n66 L.A.

A tracking system of this kind is a basic tool for ensuring that all \n2  incidents. of use of force are properly reviewed and investigated and are commonly \n3  used by large jail systems.· The lack of such a·system makes it difficult to compile \n4  the essential data to detect and address problematic patterns of use of force as they \n5  develop. \n6  210.  ShefiffBaca, Tanaka, and Bums have failed to develop and \n7  implement a policy of zero-tolerance for deputy violence and abuse of inmates. \n8  Then-Assistant Sheriff Tanaka was informed as far back as 2006 by the Captain of \n9  Men's Central Jail that there was a problem with improper use of force by deputies \n10  at Men's Central Jail.  At that time, Captain Clark also expressed concern about \n11  deputy gangs in the jail to  When.C  aptain Clark proposed to set up a \nTanaka~ \n12  rotation system to attempt to break up the deputy gangs, Tanaka transferred Clark  . \n13  out ofMen;s Central Jail. \nMr. \n14  211.  When Assistant Sheriff Tanaka informed  Olmsted that he \n15  was being made the Captain in charge ofMen's Central JaH, Tanaka told Olmsted \n16  . that use of force was a problem in the jail. \n17  212.  When SheriffBaca promoted Olmsted to Commander in the \n18  Custody Division, then Assistant Sheriff Tanaka arranged for Dan Cruz to become \n19  the Captain at MCJ, even though it was well-known within the LASD that Cruz had \n20  been transferred out of the Lennox Station for being about 18 months behind on his \n21  paperwork, including his review of use-of-force complaints.  Tanaka nonetheless \na \n22  placed him in  facility where he knew there were problems with use of force. \n23  213.  Although SheriffBaca and other high ranking officials at the . \n24  Department have been repeatedly warned that use of force by deputies is \n25  disproportionately directed at inmates with mental illtiess, the Defendant has failed \n26  to implement numerous recommendations on training and other appropriate steps to \n27  reduce force against mentally ill inmates made by experts. \n28 \n-64- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 66 of 83   Page ID #:978\n.1  214.  SheriffBaca and other high ranking officials at the Department \n2  have abjectly failed to develop policies that address the problem of endemic \n3  brutality in the Jails.  Policies regarding use of force, investigationofuse of force, \n4  discipline for deputies who have used excessive force or failed to report use of \n5  force, supervisors who have mishandled investigations of force, and training of \n6  deputies and supervisors all fail to meaningfully address the problem.  When \n7  allegations of deputy violence arise, they are infrequently investigated, and deputies \n8  are rarely disciplined.  The Defendant has failed to require the Department to track \n9  incidents ·of violence, even though systems for doing so are readily available and \n10    commonly used.  In this way, the Defendant has fostered a pattern and practice of \n11  deputy violence against inmates, which places inmates at a significant, ongoing risk \n12  of serious and irreparable injury.  Deputies and supervisors alike have come believe \n13  . that committing abuse (or failing to investigate abuse) will have absolutely no \n14  impact on one's career.  As a result, physical abuse by deputies continues \n15  unchecked.  The persistent failure or refusal of SheriffBaca and the other high \n16  ranking officials to supervise deputies properly or take action to curb the \n17  misconduct demonstrates the Defendant's deliberate indifference to the Plaintiffs' \n18  right to reasonable protection from harm. \nv. \n19  CLASS ACTIONALLEGATIONS \n20  215.  Plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin bring this action, pursuant to \n21 ·  Federal Rules of Civil Procedtire 23(a) and (b )(2), on behalf of all present and \n22  future imnates confined in the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles:  Men's \n23  Central Jail, Twin Towers, and the IRC.  Inmates assigned to Men's Central Jail \n24  and Twin Towers spend some period of time in the IRC, ·and it is commonplace for \n25  inmates to be transferred back and forth between Men's Central Jail and Twin \n26  Towers.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent meets the requirements of Rule \n27  23 as follows: \n28 \n-65- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 67 of 83   Page ID #:979\n1  A.  NUMEROSITY \n2  216.  The class meets the numerosity requirement ofRule 23(a)(1). \n3  There are more than 4,000 inmates confined within Men's Central Jail and about \n4  2,800 inmates in the Twin Towers at any given time.  Between 500 to 1,000 men \n5  are processed into or out of the jails through the IRC on any given day.  The \n6  membership of the class continuously changes, rendering joinder of all members \n7  impracticable.  The inclusion within the class of future inmates in the downtown \n8  Jail Complex also makes joinder of all members impracticable. \n9  B.  COMMONALITY \n10  217.  The class meets the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). \n11  Questions of law and fact presented by the named plaintiffs are common to other · \n12  members of the class.  The common contentions that unite the claims of the class \n13  inciude the following: \n14  (A)  There is an unlawful pattern and practice at the Jails of \n15  excessive physical violence used by Sheriffs deputies against inmates. \n16  (B)  There is an unlawful pattern and practice at the Jails of \n17  Sheriffs deputies enlisting and encouraging inmates to carry out savage attacks \n18  against other inmates and promoting inmate-on-inmate violence. \n19  (C)  There is an unlawful pattern and practi~e at the Jails of \n20  Sheriffs deputies using violence and threats of violence to coerce false statements \n21  from inmates, to cover up unlawful violence and to intimidate inma:tes and thereby \n' \n22  prevent inmates from making complaints or otherwise reporting abuse at these \n23  facilities. \n24  (D)  SheriffBaca,.UndersheriffTanaka, Assistant Sheriff \n25  Rhambo, and Chief Burns are aware of and deliberately indifferent to the use of \n26  excessive force by correctional officers and the enlisting and encouraging of \n27  inmates to carry out savage attacks in the Jails.  They acquiesce in and condone this \n28  conduct by failing to investigate it, failing to take reasonable measures to end the \n-66- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 68 of 83   Page ID #:980\n1  culture of deputy violence that fosters it, failing to punish deputies who engage in-\n2  it, protecting those deputies from criminal prosecution, and rewarding such deputies \n3  for their conduct. \nc. \n4  TYPICALITY \n5  218.  Plaintiffs meet the typicality requirement ofRule 23(a)(3), \n6  since, as alleged below, the claims of the Plaintiffs are typical ofthose ofthe class. \n7  219.  Plaintiff.Alex Rosas, twenty-four years old, is currently housed \n8  in Twin Towers.68  On July 22, 2011, Mr. Rosas witnessed a group of deputies, \n9 - including Deputies Luviano, GU:errerro, Bearer; and Ibarra, severely beating a non-\n10  resisting inmate, Arturo Fernandez, who was clad only in boxer shorts and had his \n11  hands cuffed behind his back.  As the deputies pwnmeled the handcuffed \n-12  Fernandez, they shouted that he was resisting, although he-was not.  The deputies \n·13  · then dragged Fernandez away. \n14  220.  An hour after Mr. Rosas witnessed the beating, Deputies Ibarra \n15  and Luviano came to his·cell and warned him, \"You better not say an-ything.\" \n-16  Mr. Rosas told the deputies that he had not seen anything.  Mr. Rosas was afraid \n17   that they would hurt him or arrange for other inmates to attack him. \n18  221.  A few days later~ Deputies Ibarra and Luviano again came to \n19  Mr. Rosas's cell and threatened him not to say anything.  Terrified that something \n20  would happen to him, Mr. Rosas told them again that he had not seen anything. \n21.  222.  On August 9, 2011, Deputies Bearer and Ibarra came to \n22  Mr. Rosas's cell and told him to -\"cuff up,\" meaning to allow himself to be \n23  · handcuffed.  When Mr. Rosas asked the deputies· why he needed to be cuffed, they \n24  responded that another inmate had given them a tip that Mr. Rosas had \"something\" \n25  in his cell and that they were \"going to toss up your cell.\"  The deputies handcuffed · \n. 26  him and sat him outside in the main hallway. \n27  68 LASD has transferred all Men's Central Jail inmates who submitted affidavits t~. \n· the Court in Ruther~'ord v. Baca to a singl-e unit in the Twin Towers, as of October \n. 28  5  2011. .

A few minutes later the deputies moved Mr. Rosas away from \n2  the door and out of the sightline of other inmates.  They told him they had found a \n3  \"slicer\" - a razor fashioned into a weapon- in his cell.  Mr. Rosas told the deputies \n4  that he had not altered any razors and that the weapon did not belong to him. \n5  Deputy Luviano asked Mr. Rosas, \"Why are you lying to my deputies?\" Mr. Rosas \n6  responded~ \"I'm not lying, sir.\"  The deputies punched him in the back of the head \n7  four or five times and told Mr. Rosas he would be going to the \"hole\" - disciplinary \n8  solitary confinement- for possessing the slicer. \n9  224.  Later, deputies carne to Mr. Rosas's cell with the disciplinary \n10  paperwork.  They told Mr. Rosas that if he admitted on the form that he had the \nJ 1  slicer they would \"make this easier\" for him and would not \"add on any charges.\" \n12  He understoodtpis to mean that if he lied and said he possessed a slicer then he \n13  would not be taken to disciplinary segregation and the deputies would not falsely \n.  .  '  . \n14  charge him with assault on an officer.  Mr~ Rosas refused to sign the paperwork, \n15  and the deputies escorted him to the hole. \n16  225.  Mr. Rosas asked Deputy Reza for a complaint form, butDeputy \n17  Reza refused to give him one.  Mr. Rosas told the deputy he would ask the \n18  afternoon shift deputies for a complaint form and Deputy_R eza responded that he \n19  would tell the afternoon shift not to give him the form.  When Mr. Rosas asked the \n20  afternoon shift deputies for the complaint form, they too refused to give him a form. \n21  226.  Plaintiff Jonathan Goodwin, 29 years old, is in an inmate in· \n22  Los Angeles County Jails.  He is currently housed in Twin Towers. \n23  227.  On July 22,2011, when Mr. Goodwin was housed at Men's \n24  Central Jail on the 3000 floor, he saw several deputies running towards a row of \n25  cells.  He saw deputies leading inmate Arturo Fernandez in handcuffs and then \n26  punching him and slamming him to the ground.  Mr. Fernandez fell on his face,_ \n27  with his hands cuffed behind his back.  Several deputies, including Deputies \n·28  Luviano and Ibarra, punched Mr. Fernandez on his lower back and the sides of his \n-68- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 70 of 83   Page ID #:982\n1  torso.  Another deputy kneed Mr. Fernandez in the back, as if pressing the air out of \n2  his lungs.  Mr. Fernandez yelled that he couldn't breathe.  The deputies told him to _ \n3  \"Shut the fuck up!\"  After the group of deputies punched and kicked Mr. Fernandez \n4  countless times, Deputies Ibarra and Luviano escorted Mr. Fernandez out of the \n5  housing module. \n6  228.  On August 10, 2011, Deputy Luviano came to Mr. Goodwin's \n7  -cell and told him to \"cuff up.\"  When Mr. Goodwin asked why, Deputy Luviano \n8 ·  responded that it was because he could \"do whatever the fuck I want\" and that \n9  Mr. Qoodwin \"got no rights.\"  Deputy Luviano handcuffed Mr. Goodwin behlnd \n10  his back and escorted him to the hallway. \n11  . 229.  In the hallway, Deputy Luviano pushed Mr. Goodwin against \n12  the wall and kicked his legs open.  Correctional Assistant Flannigan then \n13  approached and kicked Mr. Goodwin's ankle and punched his lower back.  Deputy \n14  Luviano punched Mr. Goodwin in the back of the head.  Other inmates exclaimed \n15  that they saw what Deputy Luviano as doing.  Custody Assistant Flannigan yelled \n16  down the row; \"You saw.that?  Whatcha ·gonna do about it?\"  Deputy Luviano and \n17  Correctional Assistant W endlent then pulled Mr. Goodwin out of the view of other. \n18  inmates. Deputy Luviano repeatedly punched Mr. Goodwin on the back ofthe \n19  head, even when other deputies walked into the area. \n20  230.  Deputy Luviano then moved around Mr. Goodwin and began to \n21  punch him repeatedly in the jaw.  Mr. Goodwin sank to the ground and tried to roll \n22  away from Deputy Luviano.  Deputy Luviano continued to punch him in the jaw, \n23  and other deputies then joined in the beating. \n24  231.  The deputies continued to beat Mr. Goodwin until Deputy \n25  Ujolla and Sergeant Soto entered the room and escorted him away.  Mr. Goodwin \n26  told Deputy Bearer and Sergeant Soto that the deputies had beaten him. \n27  Mr. Goodwin was later interviewed on camera and repeatedhis account of the \n28 \n-69- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 71 of 83   Page ID #:983\n1  incident.  During the interview, Mr. Goodwin felt that Sergeant Soto was trying to \n2  misstate the facts and put words in his mouth to make it appear that he was lying. \n3  232.  Deputies took Mr. Goodwin to the medical clinic,.where he \n4  reported that he was experiencing pain in his jaw and back molars.  Medical staff \n5  told Mr. Goodwin there was swelling in his head, yet he received no medical \n6  treatment.  Later that night, Mr. Goodwin lost a back molar that had been knocked \n7  loose during the attack. \n8  233.  On August 12, 2011, staff charged Mr. Goodwin with \n9  possession of contraband, insubordination and causing a disturbance, profanity \n10  toward staff and inmates, and refusal to follow orders. \nn  D.  ADEQUACY. OF REPRESENTATION \n12  234.  Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives and thus meet the. \n13  ·requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).  Rosas and Goodwin are presently incarcerated \n14  within the Jails at issue in this case, they have rio conflict of interest with other \n15  class members, and they will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.· \n16  They are represented by highly qualified ·and experienced counsel:  The ACLU \n17  National Prison Projed, the ACLU of Southern California, and Paul Hastings, LLP, \n18  as alleged below. \n. \n. \n19  235.  The ACLU National Prison Project and the ACLU of Southern \n20  California already serve as class cotinsel for all prisoners in the Los Angeles \n21  . County Jails in Rutherford v. Baca, a case concerning over-crowding in the Jails. \n22  . The ACLU also serves as court-appointed monitor in that case, and over a period of \n23  more than five years has conducted weekly or bi-weekly monitoring tours of Men's \n24 ·  Central Jail.  Class counsel has sought to obtain discovery on deputy-on-inmate \n25  abuse in Rutherford and moved to compel production of that discovery after the \n26  Defendant refused to tum it over.  The Court has never ruled on that motion to \n27  compel, which was submitted in December 2010.  Class counsel has also informed \n28  the Court of its intent to litigate the issue of deputy violence in an evidentiary \n-70- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 72 of 83   Page ID #:984\n-\n-\n1  hearing in Rutherford, but the Court has questioned whether the scope of the \n2  Rutherford judgment encompasses that issue.  The ACLU is thus uniquely well \n3  acquainted with the issues of deputy violence in the Jails and well equipped to \n4  litigate those claims.  Their work in Rutherford on the issues of deputy violence and \n5  overcrowding helped trigger a broad criminal investigation by the FBI and the U.S. \n6  Attorney's office, and was a key factor in the decision of the County Board of \n\"7  Supervisors in November 2011 to convene a Commission to study the causes of \n8  deputy violence in the Jails. \n9  236.  Plaintiffs' co-lead counsel Margaret Winter is the Associate \n10  Director of the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. \n11  Since 1973, the ACLU National Prison Project has been the only organization \n12  litigatmg prisoners' rights cases throughout the nation.  Attorney Winter has \n13  litigated prisoners' rights cases, most of them class actions, in federal courts in \n14  Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, Idaho, Maryland, \n15  Delaware, and Vermont, and in the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth,  and Eleventh \n16  Circuit Courts of Appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court.  She has argued and won a \n17  prisoner's rights case in the U.S. Supreme Court.  Since 2007, Winter has served as \n18  co-lead class counsel for all the inmates in Los Angeles County Jails in \n19  · Rutherford v. Baca \n20  237.  Plaintiffs' co-lead counsel Peter Eliasberg is the Legal Director \n21  ofthe ACLU Foundation of Southern California.  Since its founding in 1923, the \n22  ACLU of Southern California has been litigating a broad variety of civil rights \n23  cases, including prisoners' rights cases.  Attorney Eliasberg has been lead counsel \n24  or co-lead counsel ill numerous federal civil rights class actions in the Central \n25  District of California and has been lead counsel in civil rights matters before the \n26 ·  United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the California Supreme Court, \n27  and the United States Supreme Court, and has argued a case before the U.S. \n·28 \n-71- FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR \n,  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF · \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 73 of 83   Page ID #:985\n1  Supreme Court.  Since 2009, Eliasberg has served as co-lead class counsel for all \n2  the inmates in Los Angeles County Jails in Rutherford v. Baca. \n3  238.  Paul Hastings LLP is an international law fum with 18 offices. \n4  Paul Hastings cunently has 1,029 attorneys  including 148 attorneys in \nworldwide~ \n5  the Los Angeles office.  Paul Hastings is a global law firm and has sufficient \n6  resources to adequately represent the class.  Paul Hastings has been recognized \n7  widely for its work on pro bono cases.  The American Lawyer recently ranked Paul \n8  Hastings second in the nation in the American Lawyer Pro Bono Report of2011.  In \n9  2010, the fum was honored as the Pro Bono Law Firm of the Year by Public \n10  Counsel, the world's largest pro bono· public interest law firm.  The Los Angeles \n11  office ofPaul Hastings was awarded the 2010 Pro Bono Service Award by the \n12  Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, as the top pro bono law firm in Los Angeles. \n13  Paul Hastings has extensive experience in class action litigation, including class \n14  action lawsuits involving civil rights.  In 2009, Paul H~stingsworked with the \n15  ACLU of Southern California in a civil rights class action which rectified \n16  · unconstitutional and unsafe conditions in an immigration detention center.  Paul \n17  Hastings has also recently argued and won a civil rights case before the U.S. \n18  Supreme Court. \n19  · 239.  Plaintiffs meet the requirement of Rule 23(b)(2), as the \n20  Defendant has acted, or omitted to act, on grounds generally applicable to the class, \n21  thereby making injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n22  VI.  EXHAUSTION OF ADMlNISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n23  240.  Both of the named Plaintiffs have exhausted available \n24  administrative remedies. \n25  241.  On-August 24,2011, Mr. Goodwin filled out an inmate · \n26  complaint form stating, among other things, \"On August 24, 2011, Deputy Luviano \n27  and Correctional Assistant Flannigan and other deputies beat me up.\"  The form \n28 \n-72-.  FIRST AMENDED COMPLA1NT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 74 of 83   Page ID #:986\n1  was delivered that day to both Watch Commander Limon and Deputy Alvarez at \n2  Men's Central Jail. \n3  242.  No one from LASD has ever provided Mr. Goodwin with a \n4  response to the complaint or informed him that-the LASD was seeking an \n5  additional 15 days to complete its investigation of the complaint. \n6  243.  On August 24, 2011 Mr. Rosas filled out an inmate complaint \n7  form stating, among other things,. that on \"8/9/20 11 Deputy Luviano punched me,\" \n8  which was provided to Watch Commander Limon and Deputy Alvarez at Men's \n9  Central Jail. \n10  244.  A few days later.Senior Deputy Lauderdale approached \n11  Mr. Rosas, showed him the complaint form and asked him what it was about.  At \n12  no point has any LASD personnel provided Mr. Rosas a response to the complaint \n13  or informed him that the LASD was seeking an additional 15 days to complete its \n14  ·investigation of the complaint. \n15  245.  LASD policy provides that the department shall investigate all \n16  · complaints within 15 days of their being filed unless the department notifies the \n17  inmate in writing that it is seeking an additional 15 days to complete the \n18  investigation.  Both Plaintiffs filed their complaints more than 90 days ago without \n19  receiving any response from LASD personnel. \n20  VII.  CLAilVIS FOR RELIEF \n21  A.  Eighth Amendment To The United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. \n22  Section 1983 \n23  246.  By reason of the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 - 245, \n24  supra, plaintiffs Rosas and Goodwin, and the class they represent, were deprived. \n25  and continue to be deprived by the Defendant of their rights, under the Eighth ·and \n26  Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, to due process of law \n27  and to be free from gratuitous and excessive force, threats of gratuitous and \n28  excessive force, degrading and sadistic treatment. \n-73- FIRST AMENDED COiviPLAINT FOR \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 32   Filed 04/03/12   Page 75 of 83   Page ID #:987\n.-. \n1  247.  The failures of SheriffBaca,  and Bums to take \nTanak~, \n2  appropriate steps to curb the widespread pattern of brutality iri l\\!Ien's Central Jail, \n3  the Twin Towers, and the IRC, as described in this First Amended Complaint, \n4  constitutes deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' basic needfor reasonable protection \n.  . \n5·  from harm and violates Plaintiffs' rights to be free from cruel and unusual \n6  punishment, including physical abuse and intimidation, degrading, cruel, and \n7  sadistic treatment, and the wanton and needless infliction of pain,  guaranteed to \na~ \n8  Plaintiffs by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n9  Constitution. \n10  B.

CV 12-00428 DDP\nGOODWIN on behalf of themselves \n12  and of those similarly situated,  ORDER APPROVING CLASS \nSETTLEMENT, RETAINING \n13  Plaintiffs,  JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE \nTERMS OF SETTLEMENT \n14  vs.  AGREEMENT, DISMISSING \nACTION \n15  Jim McDonnell, Sheriff of Los Angeles \nCounty, in his official capacity, \n16  (DOCKET NUMBER 130) \nDefendant. \n17 \nHonorable Dean D. Pregerson \n18   Ctrm:  3 \n19   \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n   \n \n \n \n\n \n1  This matter came before the Court on Plaintiffs’ unopposed Motion for Final \n2  Approval of the Settlement Agreement, which was entered into between Plaintiff \n3  Alex Rosas on behalf of himself and the Plaintiff Class and Defendant \n4  (collectively, the “Parties”).   \n5  The Court certified a class defined as “all present and future inmates \n6  confined in the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles” (the “Plaintiff Class”) \n7  under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by order dated June 7, \n8  2012.  This Court entered an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement \n9  (the “Settlement Agreement”) on January 23, 2015 in which it approved the form \n10  and provision of notice of the Settlement Agreement to the Plaintiff Class, \n11  established the procedure and deadlines for members of the Plaintiff Class to \n12  object to the Settlement Agreement, and set forth other deadlines relating to the \n13  hearing for final approval of the Settlement Agreement (the “Fairness Hearing”).   \n14  Having received and considered the one written objection submitted by a \n15  member of the Plaintiff Class related to the Settlement Agreement, having held a \n16  Fairness Hearing on April 20, 2015, having reviewed the filings, documents, orders \n17  and/or admissible evidence which are currently filed of record with the Court, and \n18  having considered the arguments of counsel for the Parties, the Court hereby \n19  ORDERS as follows: \n20  1.  NOTICE PURSUANT TO RULE 23(e)(1).  Reasonable notice of the \n21  Settlement Agreement was provided to members of the Plaintiff Class in the \n22  manner directed by the Court by separate Order dated January 23, 2015.  Members \n23  of the Plaintiff Class were then afforded an opportunity to submit comments and \n24  objections to the Court concerning the Settlement Agreement.  The Court held a \n25  Fairness Hearing pursuant to Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n26  on April 20, 2015, at which it heard arguments by counsel for the Parties and a \n27  statement in support of the Settlement Agreement by a former inmate at Men’s \n28 \n-1- \n \n \n \n\n \n1  Central Jail. \n2  2.  RULE 23(e)(2) FINDINGS.  The Court makes the following findings \n3  pursuant to Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: \n4  a)  The Parties engaged in substantial motion practice before initiating \n5  settlement negotiations. \n6  b) The Settlement Agreement is the product of a lengthy, hard-fought and \n7  non-collusive negotiation process that began more than two years ago \n8  between counsel for the Plaintiff Class (“Class Counsel”) and for the \n9  Defendant. \n10  c)  Class Counsel reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents produced \n11  by Defendant and conferred repeatedly with their experts about those \n12  documents before settlement was reached. \n13  d) Any trial of this matter would have been lengthy, expensive, and involved \n14  testimony from numerous fact witnesses and experts. \n15  e)  The Settlement Agreement sets forth a comprehensive approach to \n16  addressing the allegations of a pattern of excessive force set forth in \n17  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint. \n18  Accordingly, the Court finds that the Settlement Agreement is fair, \n19  reasonable, and adequate. \n20  3.  COURT’S ADOPTION OF THE TERMS OF THE \n21  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.  The Court hereby adopts and incorporates by \n22  reference the terms of the Settlement Agreement entered into between the Parties, \n23  including the Implementation Plan developed by Richard Drooyan, Jeffrey \n24  Schwartz, and Robert Houston (“the Expert Panel”) attached thereto.  A copy of the \n25  Settlement Agreement, with the Implementation Plan, is attached hereto as \n26  Exhibit A.  \n27  4.  APPOINTMENT OF AN EXPERT PANEL TO DEVELOP AND \n28 \n-2- \n \n \n \n\n \n1  EVALUATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.  \n2  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Court previously appointed the Expert \n3  Panel, pursuant to Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, to develop an \n4  Implementation Plan designed to ensure that members of the Plaintiff Class are not \n5  subjected to excessive force in Men’s Central Jail, Twin Towers Correctional \n6  Facility, and the Inmate Reception Center (collectively, “the Jail Complex in \n7  downtown Los Angeles”).  The Court hereby appoints the Expert Panel to monitor \n8  and advise the Court on Defendant’s compliance with the Implementation Plan.   \n9  5.  DEFENDANT’S COMPLIANCE WITH THE \n10  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS OF \n11  THE EXPERT PANEL.  Defendant must comply with and implement the \n12  Implementation Plan, as modified by the Court, as soon as reasonably practicable.  \n13  6.  CLASS COUNSEL’S FEES AND EXPENSES.  The $950,000 \n14  Defendant agreed to pay to resolve Class Counsel’s attorneys’ fees and costs is well \n15  below Class Counsel’s lodestar and is reasonable in light of the time spent on the \n16  matter, the complexity of the matter, and the skill and expertise Class Counsel \n17  demonstrated in representing the Plaintiff Class. \n18  a.  Defendant shall tender to Class Counsel a warrant in the amount \n19  of $950,000 made payable to “ACLU Foundation of Southern California” within \n20  45 days, which shall constitute payment for any and all attorneys’ fees and \n21  expenses incurred, charged and/or otherwise generated by Class Counsel from the \n22  inception of the litigation through the date of entry of this Order.1  Class Counsel \n23  shall provide to Defendant any and all paperwork and information including, \n24 \n                                                 \n25  1 In evaluating the reasonableness of the amount agreed to by the Parties, the Court has reviewed \nthe declarations of John Durrant, Peter Eliasberg, Christian Lebano, Esther Lim, and Margaret \n26 \nWinter filed in support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of Settlement explaining Class \nCounsel’s fees, costs, and billing methodology, and has considered a number of factors including \n27 \n(1) the time and labor required, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (3) the \nskill requisite to perform the legal service properly, (4) the results obtained, (5) the experience, \n28 \nreputation, and ability of the attorneys, and (6) the ‘undesirability’ of the case. \n-3- \n \n \n \n\n \n1  without limitation, a duly executed W-9 IRS form, prior to receiving said payment.  \n2  b.  Defendant will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to Class \n3  Counsel for ongoing work to ensure compliance with the Settlement Agreement.  \n4  The amount of fees and costs due to Class Counsel under this paragraph will be \n5  determined on a semi-annual basis for the duration of the Court’s jurisdiction over \n6  the Settlement Agreement.  The Parties will try to reach agreement on these semi-\n7  annual fee awards and submit a stipulation for the Court’s approval.  If the Parties \n8  are unable to reach agreement on a semi-annual fee award, Class Counsel will \n9  submit a motion for reasonable attorneys’ fees, and the Court will determine the \n10  appropriate amount of fees.  Under no circumstances shall Class Counsel be entitled \n11  to payment of more than $30,000 per year in attorneys’ fees and costs to ensure \n12  compliance with the Settlement Agreement, exclusive of any fees and costs \n13  reasonably incurred to oppose any motion to modify or terminate the Settlement \n14  Agreement by Defendant pursuant to Paragraph XII(2) of the Settlement \n15  Agreement. \n16  7.  DISMISSAL OF THE CIVIL ACTION.  Upon the entry of this \n17  Order, the Clerk for the United States District Court for the Central District of \n18  California is hereby directed to administratively close this case and enter a \n19  dismissal of the Civil Action with prejudice. \n20  8.  COURT’S RETENTION OF JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE \n21  THE ORDER.  Notwithstanding the provision in Paragraph 7 above, the Court \n22  shall retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the provisions of the Settlement \n23  Agreement or modifying it in accordance with Section XIV(6) of that agreement.  \n24  9.  NO APPEAL.  All Parties have waived all rights to seek any appeal \n25  from and/or appellate review of this Order. \n26  10.  FINDINGS PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).  The Court \n27  specifically finds that, although this matter was not actually litigated or resolved on \n28 \n-4- \n \n \n \n\n \n1  the merits, the relief in this Order is narrowly drawn, extends no further than \n2  necessary to correct the alleged violations of the Federal rights, and is the least \n3  intrusive means necessary to correct the alleged violations of the Federal rights.   \n4  Nothing contained in this Order or the Settlement Agreement shall be \n5  construed as an admission of any kind by the County of Los Angeles, any \n6  Defendant and/or any agent, employee, officer and/or representative of the Los \n7  Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.  This Order shall not be admissible in any \n8  court, except to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  \n9  The Clerk of the Court is DIRECTED to enter this document on the civil \n10  docket as a Final Judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n11  Procedure. \n12  This case is closed. \n13  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n14   \n15  Dated:  April 21, 2015  By:           \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n16 \n  HON. DEAN D. PREGERSON \n17   \n \n18 \n19  Submitted by: \nPeter Eliasberg \n20  Attorney for Plaintiff Class \n21   \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n-5- \n \n \n ",

      "text": " \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE OF CLAIMS \n \nRECITALS \n \nA.  This Settlement Agreement and Release (“Agreement”) is made and entered into on \nor about September 26, 2014, by and between Plaintiff Alex Rosas on behalf of himself and the \nPlaintiff Class, as defined below, on the one hand, and Defendant Sheriff John L. Scott, in his \nofficial capacity (“Defendant”), on the other hand, (collectively, “the Parties”) with reference to \nthe following facts: \n \nB.  Plaintiffs Alex Rosas and Jonathan Goodwin (“Named Plaintiffs”) filed a \nComplaint, and thereafter a First Amended Complaint (“Complaint”) in the United States \nDistrict Court, Central District of California, entitled Alex Rosas, et al. v. Leroy D. Baca, Case \nNo. CV 12-00428 DDP, which arose out of certain alleged acts and/or omissions by Defendant \n(“the Civil Action”).  In the Civil Action, Plaintiffs sought certain declaratory and injunctive \nrelief against Defendant as a result of purported events that occurred at Men’s Central Jail \n(“MCJ”), Twin Towers Correctional Facility (“TTCF”), and the Inmate Reception Center \n(“IRC”) (collectively, “the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles”), and that allegedly resulted \nin injuries to the Plaintiff Class; \n  \nC.  On or about June 7, 2012, the Court entered an order granting Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, certifying a \ndeclaratory/injunctive relief class that, for purposes of this Agreement, is defined as “all inmates, \nnow and in the future, in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department in the Jail \nComplex in downtown Los Angeles” (“the Plaintiff Class”); \n \nD.  Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are represented by court-appointed class \ncounsel, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, and \nPaul Hastings LLP (collectively, “Class Counsel”); and, \n \nE.  The Parties desire to settle all of the claims arising out of the Civil Action which \nNamed Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have or may have against Defendant, including its \nemployees, representatives, and agents, both named and unnamed, as of the date of this \nAgreement.  \n \nIT IS THEREFORE AGREED BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS FOLLOWS: \n \nI.  AGREEMENT CONTINGENT ON APPROVAL BY THE COURT AND THE \nBOARD OF SUPERVISORS. \n1.  This Agreement and the obligations of the Parties thereunder are contingent upon the \nfinal approval by the Court, as set forth below. \n \n2.  This Agreement and the obligations of the Parties thereunder also are contingent upon the \napproval by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (“the Board”), as set forth below.   \n \n1 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \n3.  In the event that:  (1) this Agreement does not receive approval by the Board; (2) this \nAgreement does not receive final approval by the Court; or (3) any appeal of the Court’s final \napproval of this Agreement is filed and not upheld on appeal, then this Agreement shall be of no \nforce or effect and shall not be admissible in any court for any reason, except that Defendant \nagrees to pay reasonable compensation to the Panel, as defined below, for services rendered as of \nthat date. \n \nII.  APPOINTMENT OF A PANEL TO DEVELOP A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN \nAND EVALUATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN. \n1.  The Court will appoint Richard Drooyan, Jeffrey Schwartz, and Robert Houston (“the \nPanel”), pursuant to Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, to develop a corrective action \nplan (“Action Plan”) designed to ensure that the Plaintiff Class are not subjected to excessive \nforce in the Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles, and to monitor and advise the Court on \nDefendant’s compliance with the Action Plan.   \n \n2.  The Panel will be entitled to reasonable compensation in an amount approved by the \nBoard and the Court.  Defendant will bear the cost of the compensation of the Panel.   \n \n3.  In the event Mr. Drooyan becomes unavailable during the term of this Agreement, then \nDefendant will select his replacement.  If Mr. Schwartz becomes unavailable during the term of \nthis Agreement, then Class Counsel will select his replacement.  If Mr. Houston becomes \nunavailable during the term of this Agreement, then the Parties will meet and confer to reach \nagreement regarding a replacement.   \nIII.  DEVELOPMENT AND SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE ACTION PLAN. \n1.  By October 6, 2014, at latest, the Panel will submit the Action Plan to the Court for its \nreview and approval. \n \n2.  In developing the Action Plan, the Panel may consider provisions relating to Use of Force \nPolicies, Practices and Documentation; Training and Professional Development Related to Use \nof Force; Use of Force on Prisoners with Mental Illness and other Special Needs Populations; \nSecurity Policies and Practices; and any such other areas regarding use of force as they may \ndeem necessary.  In developing the Action Plan, the Panel will make best efforts to make it \nconsistent with the recommendations of the Citizen’s Commission on Jail Violence, which \nDefendant is already in the process of implementing.  In developing the Action Plan, the Panel \nwill make its best estimates as to how long it should take Defendant to implement each \nrecommendation and include those estimates in its Action Plan. \n \n3.  Prior to submitting the Action Plan to the Court, the Panel will provide a draft of the \nAction Plan to the Parties for their review and comment.  After input from the Parties, the Panel \nmay, in their discretion, revise the draft Action Plan.  Within 30 days of the Panel providing a \nfinal version of the Action Plan to the Parties, counsel for Defendant shall submit the Action \nPlan and this Agreement to the Board for its review and consideration with respect to whether to \napprove the Agreement.  Within 60 days of the Panel providing a final version of the Action Plan \nto the Parties, the Board shall decide whether it will approve the Agreement.  If the Board \n2 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \napproves the Agreement, the Parties will seek preliminary and then final approval of this \nAgreement with the Court as set forth below.  If the Board fails to indicate its approval or \ndisapproval of the Agreement within 60 days of the Panel providing a final version of the Action \nPlan to the Parties, the Agreement will be deemed rejected at which time either Party may \nrequest confirmation from the Court that settlement discussions have ended.   \n \nIV.  CLASS NOTICE AND SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS HEARING. \nThe following procedures will govern the Court’s preliminary and final approval of this \nAgreement and notice to the Plaintiff Class: \n \n1.  Within 21 days of any approval of the Action Plan and the Agreement by the Board, the \nParties will file a joint stipulation requesting that the Court grant preliminary approval of this \nAgreement, as well as approve the notice to the Plaintiff Class.  The Parties will submit the \nproposed forms of all notices and other documents necessary to implement this Agreement to the \nCourt, including the final Action Plan.  The Parties will translate the proposed class notice into \nSpanish.  Defendant will provide notice of the proposed settlement to the appropriate federal and \nstate officials, as required by the Class Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”) codified at 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1715. \n2.  If the Court grants preliminary approval of this Agreement and approves the notice to the \nPlaintiff Class, the Parties will take the following steps to effect notice of this Agreement as \nrequired by the CAFA: \n \na.  Defendant will promptly post a copy of the notice to the Plaintiff Class in both \nEnglish and Spanish in the common area of all housing units in MCJ and TTCF and \nin places in the IRC where inmates who are being processed into the jails can read \nthem; \nb.  Defendant will post copies of the notice to the Plaintiff Class in both English and \nSpanish in places where K-10 inmates and inmates in disciplinary segregation in MCJ \nand TTCF can read them.  Defendant will provide copies of the notice upon request to \nK-10 inmates and inmates who have been in disciplinary segregation in MCJ and \nTTCF for more than 10 days during the notice period.  Defendant will bear the cost of \ntranslating, printing, posting, and distributing the notice to the Plaintiff Class; and \nc.  Defendant and Class Counsel promptly will post a copy of the notice to the Plaintiff \nClass in both English and Spanish on their respective websites. \n3.  Objecting to the Settlement.  The notice to the Plaintiff Class will provide that class \nmembers (“Class Members”) who wish to object to the Agreement prior to the fairness hearing \nmay do so by filing with the Court a written statement objecting to the Agreement.   \n \n4.  Fairness Hearing:  On or after the later of:  (1) 51 days of the posting of the notice to the \nPlaintiff Class, or (2) 90 days of the last date of service of the proposed settlement on the \nappropriate federal and state officials as required by CAFA, the Court will conduct a hearing for \nfinal approval of this Agreement (“the Fairness Hearing”).  No Class Member will be entitled to \n3 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \nbe heard at the Fairness Hearing (whether individually or through separate counsel) unless \nwritten notice of the Class Member’s intention to appear at the Fairness Hearing is served on \ncounsel for the Parties no later than 21 days prior to the Fairness Hearing.  The Court, in its \ndiscretion, may determine which Class Members, if any, who have requested to appear will be \nentitled to appear and be heard at the Fairness Hearing.  No Class Member may object to this \nAgreement, unless copies of any written objections or briefs are filed with the Court and served \non counsel for the Parties no later than 21 days prior to the Fairness Hearing.  Class Members \nwho fail to file and serve timely objections in the manner specified above will be deemed to have \nwaived any objections and will be foreclosed from making any objection (whether by appeal or \notherwise) to this Agreement or the Court’s approval thereof.   \n \n5.  In the event that the Court grants final approval of this Agreement, it shall enter an order: \n(1) memorializing its final approval of this Agreement; (2) granting costs and attorneys’ fees to \nClass Counsel as set forth in Section XIII; (3) dismissing the Civil Action, with prejudice \n(including, without limitation, dismissal in favor of Defendant and all of its employees, \nrepresentatives, and agents, both named and unnamed); and (4) retaining jurisdiction for the \npurpose of enforcing the provisions of this Agreement or modifying it in accordance with \nSection XIV(6) below.  The Parties shall bear their own costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees \nincurred in the Civil Action, except as otherwise provided herein.   \n \nV.  PERIODIC REPORTS BY THE PANEL.  \nThe Panel will prepare and submit to the Parties and the Court periodic reports evaluating \nDefendant’s compliance with the Action Plan (“Reports”) at intervals the Panel shall \ndetermine.  The Panel will provide the Reports to the Parties in draft form prior to submission \nto the Court, will consider the Parties’ comments, and may in its discretion make responsive \nchanges before submitting the Reports to the Court.  The Reports shall state that they are \ncreated for purposes of this settlement.  The Reports may not be used against Defendant in any \nother legal proceeding for any purpose.     \n \nVI.  INSPECTION BY CLASS COUNSEL. \nOn reasonable notice, Class Counsel will have reasonable access to the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles, including without limitation staff, inmates, and documents, for \ninspection to evaluate compliance with the Action Plan.  Class Counsel shall provide \nDefendant’s counsel with 10 days’ notice before any document request and 4 days’ notice before \nany on-site inspection.  Defendant’s counsel shall have the right to be present for any jail \ninspection and/or discussion with Sheriff’s Department personnel.  Defendant reserves the right \nto object, whether on privilege grounds or otherwise, to any document request made by Class \nCounsel.  The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes concerning \nobjections to document requests from Class Counsel and if the dispute cannot be resolved, to \nsubmit the issue to the Court for resolution.  Any information or documents obtained by Class \nCounsel under this section may be used solely for purposes of this action and may not be used in \nany other action for any purpose.  Nothing in this section shall restrict monitoring activities by \nthe ACLU (such as readily available access to Title 15 logs) in Rutherford v. Scott, Case No. CV \n75-04111-DDP. \n \n4 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \n \nVII.  RELEASE. \n1.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and as separate consideration for the \nagreements contained herein, Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class hereby absolutely, fully \nand forever release, relieve, waive, relinquish, and discharge Defendant and its successors, \npredecessors, related entities, departments, subsidiaries, representatives, assigns, agents, partners, \nofficers, directors, managers, insurers, shareholders, employees, and attorneys, including, \nwithout limitation, the Board and Lawrence Beach Allen & Choi, A Professional Corporation, \nand each of them (“Released Parties”), of, and from, any and all known claims for equitable \nrelief, subject to the following limitations:  (i) this waiver shall not apply to claims based on acts \nor omissions arising after the date of execution of this Agreement; and (ii) this waiver shall be \nlimited to the allegations made in the Complaint (which do not include claims for damages).  \n \n2.  Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class acknowledge their intention that, upon execution \nby the Parties and approval by the Court, this Agreement, except as expressly provided for \nherein, shall be effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction and settlement of and as a bar \nto all of the claims in the Civil Action.  Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class acknowledge \nthat they have been informed by their attorneys, or otherwise have been informed of, and that \nthey are familiar with, Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, which provides \nas follows: \n \nA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to \nexist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have \nmaterially affected his settlement with the debtor. \n \nNamed Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class hereby waive and relinquish all rights and benefits \nagainst the Released Parties that they have or may have under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of \nthe State of California, subject to the following limitations:  (i) this waiver shall not apply to \nclaims based on acts or omissions arising after the date of execution of this Agreement; and (ii) \nthis waiver shall be limited to the allegations made in the Complaint (which do not include \nclaims for damages). \n \n3.  Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class agree, represent, and warrant that they \nunderstand that the Civil Action involves arguable and disputed questions of fact and law, that \nthe liability of Defendant for the alleged acts in the Civil Action is disputed, and that the \nconsideration provided herein is not to be construed as an admission of liability by Defendant, \nwhich is expressly denied, and that this Agreement arises from compromise. \nVIII.  TERMINATION.  \n1.  After the final approval of this Agreement by the Court, Defendant will implement each \nand every recommendation from the Panel contained in the Action Plan as soon as reasonably \npracticable. When the Panel certifies that any recommendation of the Action Plan has been \nimplemented, it shall commence a period of monitoring the Defendant’s compliance with respect \nto that recommendation (“Compliance Period”).  It is anticipated that there will be multiple \nCompliance Periods for the various recommendations contained in the Action Plan, and that \n5 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \nDefendant will implement and be judged to be in compliance with numerous recommendations \nin six months or less from the submission of the Action Plan to the Court, others in six to twelve \nmonths from the submission of the Action Plan to the Court, and there is a possibility that \nDefendant may be judged to have come into compliance with others more than twelve months \nfrom the submission of the Action Plan to the Court.  If, after the Panel reports that the \nDefendant has initially reached compliance, the Panel subsequently reports that Defendant has \nfallen out of compliance, Plaintiffs may make a motion to the Court for contempt, but only after \nhaving engaged in a good faith attempt to resolve the issue of noncompliance with Defendant’s \ncounsel and having allowed a reasonable period to cure noncompliance.  The Court may exercise \nits equitable powers to fashion relief, including ordering compliance and extending the \ncompliance period, consistent with the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”).  Alternatively, \nPlaintiffs may request that the Panel propose a remedial plan, which may include an extension of \nthe compliance period, consistent with the PLRA, for the Court’s approval. \n2.  Defendant may seek to terminate this Agreement through application to the Court, \nconsistent with the PLRA, at such time as all of the following conditions have been satisfied: \n            (a) For those recommendations that the Panel certifies the Defendant has \nimplemented in six months or less after the submission of the Action Plan to the Court: (i) \nDefendant must sustain compliance with each of those recommendations for either a period of at \nleast 18 consecutive months or satisfy any alternative requirements imposed pursuant to \nParagraph 1 above; and (ii) Defendant must sustain simultaneous compliance with all those \nrecommendations for a period of at least 12 consecutive months prior to filing a motion to \nterminate; \n           (b) For those recommendations that the Panel certifies the Defendant has \nimplemented in six to twelve months after the submission of the Action Plan to the Court: (i) \nDefendant must sustain compliance with each of those recommendations for either a period of at \nleast 18 consecutive months or satisfy any alternative requirements imposed pursuant to \nParagraph 1 above; and (ii) Defendant must sustain simultaneous compliance with all those \nrecommendations for a period of at least 12 consecutive months prior to filing a motion to \nterminate; and \n          (c) For those recommendations that the Panel certifies the Defendant has \nimplemented in more than twelve months after the submission of the Action Plan to the Court: (i) \nDefendant must sustain compliance with each of those recommendations for either a period of at \nleast 18 consecutive months or satisfy any alternative requirements imposed pursuant to \nParagraph 1 above; and (ii) Defendant must sustain simultaneous compliance with all those \nrecommendations for a period of at least 12 consecutive months prior to filing a motion to \nterminate. \nThe period of simultaneous compliance for the recommendations that Defendant \nimplements in six months or less need not run concurrently with the period of simultaneous \ncompliance for the recommendations that Defendant implements in six to twelve months.  \nNeither of those periods needs to run concurrently with the period of simultaneous compliance \n6 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \nfor the recommendations that Defendant implements in more than twelve months if those \nrecommendations that were implemented more than twelve months after submission of the \nAction Plan to the Court were ones the panel estimated in its Action Plan would take more than \n12 months to implement.  However, if Defendant fails to implement within 12 months one or \nmore recommendations that the Panel estimated could be implemented in 12 months or less, \nDefendant must maintain simultaneous compliance with those recommendations and the \nrecommendations that were implemented in six to twelve months after the submission of the \nAction Plan to the Court for a period of at least 12 consecutive months prior to filing a motion to \nterminate. \n \nIX.  PLAINTIFFS’ AND THE PLAINTIFF CLASS’S ALLEGATIONS, \nDEFENDANT’S DENIALS, AND LACK OF ADMISSION OF LIABILITY. \nIn the Civil Action, Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class allege that they have been subjected \nto a pattern of grossly excessive force, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution.  Defendant generally and specifically denies all Named Plaintiffs’ \nand the Plaintiff Class’s allegations.  It is understood that this Agreement is not an admission of \nany liability or wrongdoing on the part of Defendant and/or its employees, agents and former \nemployees and agents of Defendant or any other persons. \n \n \nX.  AGREEMENT CONDITIONAL ON FINDINGS BY THE COURT PURSUANT \nTO 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) \nThis Agreement will become null and void unless the Court, in its Stipulated Order and Final \nJudgment, makes findings that although this matter was not actually litigated or resolved on the \nmerits, the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the alleged \nviolations of the Federal rights, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the alleged \nviolations of the Federal rights.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).  Notwithstanding any other term \nof this Agreement, the Parties stipulate that Defendant expressly disclaims and does not admit \nthat Defendant is committing any violation of any Federal right.  Except to enforce this \nAgreement, this Section of this Agreement shall not be admissible against Defendant in any \ncourt for any purpose. \n \nXI.  REPRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSION OF THIS AGREEMENT \nIn entering this Agreement, Plaintiff Alex Rosas, on behalf of himself and the Plaintiff Class, \nrepresents that he has relied upon the advice of Class Counsel, who are the attorneys of his own \nchoice, concerning the legal and other consequences of this Agreement; that the terms of this \nAgreement have been completely read and explained to him by Class Counsel; and the terms of \nthis Agreement are fully understood and voluntarily accepted by him.  Plaintiff Alex Rosas \nhereby further represents that he has not received or relied upon any legal or other advice from \nDefendant, Defendant’s representatives, and/or attorneys. \n \n \n7 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \nXII.  WARRANTY OF CAPACITY TO EXECUTE AGREEMENT. \nPlaintiff Alex Rosas, on behalf of himself and the Plaintiff Class, represents and warrants that no \nother person(s) or entity has, or has had, any interest in the claims, demands, obligations, or \ncauses of action referred to in this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth herein; that he has \nthe sole right and exclusive authority to execute this Agreement; and that he has not sold, \nassigned, transferred, conveyed or otherwise disposed of any of the claims, demands, obligations \nor causes of action referred to in this Agreement. \n \nXIII.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS. \n1.  Assuming this Agreement is approved by the Court and the Board, and is upheld on \nappeal (if any), within 45 days of the later of the Court’s final approval of the Agreement or the \nresolution of any appeal, Defendant shall tender to Class Counsel a warrant in the amount of \n$950,000 made payable to “ACLU Foundation of Southern California” for full and final \nsatisfaction of any and all claims by Named Plaintiffs, the Plaintiff Class, and Class Counsel for \nattorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs related to the Civil Action.  Class Counsel acknowledge and \nagree to provide to Defendant any and all paperwork and information including, without \nlimitation, a duly executed W-9 IRS form, prior to receiving said payment. \n \n2.  Defendant will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to Class Counsel for ongoing \nwork to ensure compliance with this Agreement.  The amount of fees and costs due to Class \nCounsel under this paragraph will be determined on a semi-annual basis for the duration of the \nCourt’s jurisdiction over this Agreement.  The Parties will try to reach agreement on these semi-\nannual fee awards and submit a stipulation for the Court’s approval.  If the Parties are unable to \nreach agreement on a semi-annual fee award, Class Counsel will submit a motion for reasonable \nattorneys’ fees, and the Court will determine the appropriate amount of fees.  Under no \ncircumstances shall Class Counsel be entitled to payment of more than $30,000 per year in \nattorneys’ fees and costs to ensure compliance with this Agreement, exclusive of any fees and \ncosts reasonably incurred to oppose any motion to modify or terminate this Agreement by \nDefendant. \n \n3.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if it becomes necessary for the \nPlaintiffs to incur additional legal fees in connection with a motion for contempt, the Court may \naward reasonable fees. \n \nXIV.  MISCELLANEOUS. \n1.   Counterparts.   \n \nThis Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be \ndeemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. \n \n2.   California Law.   \n \nThis Agreement shall be interpreted under and pursuant to the laws of the State of California \nand not construed for or against any party. \n8 \nHOA.1098696.2 \n \n\n \n \n3.   Successors and Assigns.   \n \nAll of the terms and provisions contained herein shall inure to the benefit of and shall be \nbinding upon the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and \nassigns. \n \n4.   Parties in Interest. \n \nNothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or \nremedies under or by reason of this Agreement on any persons other than the Parties and their \nrespective successors and assigns, nor is anything in this Agreement intended to relieve or \ndischarge the obligation or liability of any third persons to any party to this Agreement, nor shall \nany provision give any third person any right of subrogation or action over or against any party \nto this Agreement. \n \n5.

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the “Rosas” case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the “Panel”) will “prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n[developed by the Panel] (‘Reports’) at intervals the Panel shall determine.”  This Report sets \nforth the Panel’s assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020 (the “Eighth \nReporting Period”), and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas case.  In \naccordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement, it takes into consideration comments \nreceived from the Parties on December 14 and 15, 2020, regarding the draft of the report that \nwas sent to them on December 1, 2020.   \nIn May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel “to develop a corrective action plan (‘Action \nPlan’) designed to ensure that [inmates] are not subject to excessive force in the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles” (the “Downtown Jail Complex”).  The plan developed by the Panel sets \nforth provisions in twenty-one areas that the Sheriff is required to implement in the Downtown \nJail Complex.  The plan was approved by the Court on April 7, 2016.  Under Paragraph VIII of \nthe Settlement Agreement, “[w]hen the Panel certifies that any recommendation of the Action \nPlan has been implemented, it shall commence a period of monitoring the Defendant’s \ncompliance with respect to that recommendation (‘Compliance Period’).”   \nAs of November 1, 2018, the Sheriff’s Department (the “Department”) has implemented \n104 of the Panel’s 106 recommendations.  The remaining two recommendations, Section 4.10 \n(expansion of conflict resolution training) and Section 9.1 (security checks), have been \nsuperseded by the Settlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in United States v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, et al., CV No. 15-05903 (JEMx) (the “DOJ case”).1   \nThe Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex during the Eighth Reporting Period on \nFebruary 27 and 28, 2020.2  During that visit, the Panel spoke to a number of inmates in the \nDowntown Jail Complex.  Although we heard some complaints about the responsiveness of staff \nand adequacy of medical care, as in the past, the inmates interviewed consistently told us that \nexcessive force was not an issue in the County Jails.  The Panel continues to sense a positive \nculture regarding the treatment of inmates and the use of force within the jails.  The importance \nof this finding should not be underestimated.  When the Panel’s work began in 2014, the \nDowntown jails had achieved considerable notoriety and it was clear that the beating of inmates \nhad to stop and the staff culture – then anti-inmate and enforcement-oriented – had to change.  It \nhas.  The beatings stopped years ago, and the jail culture has become service-oriented and \nremains so.  Those changes were accomplished by the men and women of the Department and \n1 The other recommendations in the Rosas Action Plan have been implemented in the \nother jail facilities outside of the Downtown Jail Complex pursuant to Paragraph 81 of \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the DOJ case. \n2 Due to restrictions and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Panel \nwas not able to visit the jails in the Second Quarter of 2020. \n1 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 4 of 30   Page ID #:4301\n \nthat, too, should not be lost in assessing the Department’s progress since the Panel commenced \nits work. \n   \nIn the Panel’s Seventh Report, we noted the continuing reduction in the number of force \nincidents in 2019 in the Downtown Jail Complex, with an average of 115 force incidents per \nmonth in these facilities in the first half of the year and an average of 107 force incidents per \nmonth in the second half of the year.  These statistics compared favorably to 2018, when the \nmonthly average was 130.  We noted with concern, however, that while the total number of force \nincidents decreased in 2019, the number of Category 2 force incidents3 increased 8.7% from a \ntotal of 23 per month in 2018 to 25 per month in 2019.  The decrease in total force incidents \nfrom 2018 to 2019 was attributable almost entirely to the substantial decrease in the number of \nminor “non-categorical incidents.”4  \n \n  In the first half of 2020, not only has the positive trend with respect to the total number of \nforce incidents continued, but the number of Category 2 force incidents has decreased \nsubstantially from 2019.  According to data provided by the Department, during the Eighth \nReporting Period, the total number of force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex was 454, an \naverage of 76 per month.  This represents a 29% decrease from the second half of 2019, and a \n41% decrease from 2018.  With respect to Category 2 incidents, the monthly average has \ndropped from 25 in 2019 to 13 in the first six months of 2020.  This represents a 48% decrease in \nCategory 2 incidents.  The decreases in Category 2 incidents from the Seventh Reporting Period \nwere seen at all three of the Downtown jail facilities.5   \n \n  The numbers with respect to Category 3 force incidents are not definitive.  According to \nthe Department’s posted self-assessment, there were four Category 3 cases in 2019, all of which \noccurred at the MCJ facility.6  In the first half of 2020, there was one Category 3 case at TTCF \nand three cases at MCJ.  While Category 3 incidents will remain a focus of the Panel because of \ntheir severity, the small overall numbers of such incidents prevent drawing reliable conclusions \nabout changes over time.7 \n \n  During the Eighth Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 49 completed force packages \nthat were selected by the Panel from a comprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the \nDepartment.  The Panel selected 29 force packages for review in the First Quarter of 2020 and \nreceived 27 of those force packages.  In the Second Quarter of 2020, the Panel received 22 of the \n                                                 \n3 Category 2 force encompasses most incidents with an “identifiable injury,” including \nrelatively minor injuries such as a cut or a bruise.  Force that is likely to, or does, result in severe \ninjuries is classified as a Category 3 incident.    \n4 “Non-categorical incidents” are minor uses of force that are used to control inmates, are \ncaptured on video, and do not result in injuries or complaints of pain. \n5 Much of this decrease is undoubtedly attributable to the significant reduction in the \ninmate population in the Second Quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The positive \nresults were also present in the first three months of the year, but to a much lesser extent.  \n6 There were no Category 3 cases at either IRC or TTCF in 2018 or 2019.   \n7 The Panel does not share Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Category 3 data as reflecting \na “disturbing” trend.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 5 of 30   Page ID #:4302\n \n26 requested force packages.8  Although the force incidents at issue occurred primarily in 2019, \nthe Department was not able to complete its investigations regarding many of the force incidents \nin time for the Panel to evaluate the cases during the Eighth Reporting Period.  The inability of \nthe Department to complete its use of force investigations in a timely manner has substantially \nimpacted the Panel’s ability to assess and review force packages.  For several years, the Panel \nhas identified 25 cases near the beginning of a quarter, and the Department has usually been able \nto complete most, if not all, of those identified cases that were in progress and then sent the Panel \nall 25 cases in time for the Panel to review them and then meet with the Custody managers about \nproblematic cases early in the next quarter.  Essentially, the Panel’s review process was self-\ncontained, quarter by quarter. That has now been lost.  Cases identified for first quarter review \nwere still arriving in the second and third quarters.  Importantly, that makes it more difficult to \nassess progress over time.  The Panel has recently discussed this issue with the Sheriff and with \nthe Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations, and in its response to the Panel’s draft report the \nDepartment has outlined a series of concrete steps designed to improve the timeliness of \ncompletion of force packages.  The Panel looks forward to working with the Department to \naddress this situation.  \n \n     Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Department provides the Panel with self-\nassessments of its compliance with the non-force related provisions in the Action Plan.  The \nDepartment submitted its Eighth Self-Assessment Status Report (the “Eighth Self-Assessment”) \non September 15, 2020, and augmented its self-assessment (the “Augmented Eighth Self-\nAssessment”) on October 20, 2020.  During the Eighth Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed \nrecords posted by the Department to verify the Department’s self-assessments of its compliance \nwith non-force provisions of the Action Plan.  All of the Department’s training results are subject \nto verification by auditors retained by the Panel.  \n \n  During the Seventh Reporting Period, a new Assistant Sheriff took over the leadership of \nthe Department’s Custody Operations.  Under the new Custody leadership, the Department \ncontinued to cooperate fully with the Panel during the Eighth Reporting Period.  The Department \nand County Counsel facilitated our visits and inmate interviews, answered our questions, and \nresponded to our requests for documents and information.  They also engaged in constructive \nconversations with the Panel about our findings regarding the use of force incidents we reviewed \nand the Department’s continuing efforts to implement the terms of the Rosas Action Plan.  We \nappreciate their responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, and courtesy in handling our \nmonitoring requests.   \n \n         \n                                                 \n8 One additional package from the Second Quarter list was received in late-October and \nwill be reviewed during the Ninth Reporting period. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 6 of 30   Page ID #:4303\n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  A.  Leadership and Accountability \n \n  The recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that Custody \nbe headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the Sheriff be engaged \npersonally in the management of the jails, the Department’s managers be held accountable for \nany failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly report to the \nBoard of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and on its compliance with the Action Plan.    \n \n  The Department has been in Compliance with Sections 1.1 of the Action Plan since well \nbefore January 1, 2017.9  Custody has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of \nresponsibility since mid-2014.  It was under the direction of Assistant Sheriff Bruce Chase \nduring the Eighth Reporting Period.  Although Assistant Sheriff Chase does not have the \n“experience in managing a large corrections facility or running a corrections department” outside \nthe Department as recommended by the Citizens’ Commission on Jail Violence, he was formerly \nthe Captain of the Custody Compliance and Sustainability Bureau (CCSB) and a Chief in \nCustody Operations, has extensive knowledge of the requirements of the Rosas Action Plan, and \nhas expressed to the Panel his commitment to the reforms mandated by the Plan.  The Panel has \nfound Assistant Sheriff Chase to be accessible, forthright and fully supportive of the work of the \nPanel. \n \n  Due to COVID-related restrictions, the Panel was not able to meet with Sheriff \nVillanueva during the first half of 2020.10  The Department has provided the Panel with a log of \nthe frequent meetings that Sheriff Villanueva had with Assistant Sheriff Chase from January 8, \n2020, through June 30, 2020, to review use of force incidents, the use of less lethal weapons and \npersonal weapons, cell extractions, Category 3 incidents and associated injuries, use of force \nagainst mentally ill inmates, dorm disturbances, gassing incidents, deployment of chemical \nagents, de-escalation of force, suicide attempts and rescue force, inmates entering the facilities \nunder the influence and available detox housing units, facility security concerns, assaults on \nstaff, and alternative tactical approaches to address current inmate populations.  The Panel is \nsatisfied that the Sheriff is personally engaged in the management of the Department’s Custody \noperations and the Department is in Compliance with Section 1.2 of the Action Plan. \n                                                 \n9 Use of the term Compliance in bold is a finding of compliance as of a certain date.  The \nPanel’s findings are set forth on the Appendix attached hereto.  For other provisions, the \nDepartment has either not achieved compliance or is no longer in compliance during this current \nreporting period.  Based upon the Panel’s findings, the Parties will determine whether the \nSettlement Agreement is subject to termination pursuant to Section VIII of the agreement.  As \nnoted in the Panel’s prior reports, the Panel encourages the “Parties to adopt a meaningful and \nachievable framework to determine the Department’s compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement” in the future.    \n10 The Panel met with the Sheriff by video conference on November 3, 2020. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 7 of 30   Page ID #:4304\n \n \nSection 1.3 of the Action Plan provides that Department managers should be held \naccountable should they fail to address use of force problems at the Department’s jail facilities.  \nThe Compliance Measures require the Department to provide a quarterly report that sets forth the \nnumber and rank of personnel found to have violated its use of force policies in the jails.  In the \nFirst Quarter of 2020, the Department reports one disposition for a founded violation of the \nDepartment’s use of force policies arising out of a 2019 incident in MCJ, which resulted in a \nwritten reprimand.  There were no founded dispositions at TTCF or IRC in the First Quarter of \n2020.  In the Second Quarter of 2020, there were no founded dispositions for violation of the \nDepartment’s use of force policies at any of the Downtown jail facilities.  While this report \nsatisfies the applicable Compliance Measure, the Panel is concerned that reports of “founded \ndispositions of violations of the Department’s use of force policies” do not provide the data \nnecessary for the Panel to assess whether Department managers are appropriately addressing use \nof force policies at the jails.  The Panel is aware, based on its review of force packages, of \ninstances in which violations of the Department’s use of force policies did not result in findings \nof violations or disciplinary action for founded violations.  The Panel has expressed concern for \nseveral reporting periods that the Department relies too heavily on remedial training rather than \ndiscipline in situations where the Department agrees that use of force policies have been \nviolated.  The Panel has also seen numerous cases involving violations of policy, such as head \npunches for inmate control, that result in outcomes that do not reflect the seriousness of the \noffense.  We look forward to working with the Department to evaluate additional data and \nmetrics to assess the Department’s compliance with Section 1.3 going forward.11 \n \nCompliance Measures for Section 1.3 also require the Department to provide data \nregarding overall force incidents and Category 3 incidents so the Panel can assess whether there \nhave been substantial increases and whether any such increases have been appropriately \naddressed by Unit Commanders and Commanders.  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, \nthere was a 21.5% decrease in overall force incidents at IRC, an 8.9% decrease at MCJ, and a \n5.6% increase at TTCF in the First Quarter of 2020.  With respect to Category 3 incidents, there \nwas an increase from two incidents in the Fourth Quarter of 2019 to four incidents in the First \nQuarter of 2020.12  While this represents a 100% increase, the Category 3 incidents do not appear \nto raise concerns about a pattern of excessive force given the nature of the incidents and the \nrelatively small number of them.  Command Staff at the two impacted facilities appear to have \ntaken appropriate measures to address the modest increases in Category 3 incidents.  \nAccordingly, the Department was in Compliance with Section 1.3 of the Action Plan at all of the \nDowntown jail facilities in the First Quarter of 2020.   \n \n  For the Second Quarter of 2020, all three Downtown jail facilities experienced a \nsubstantial decrease in force incidents.  Excluding non-categorical force incidents, there was a \n                                                 \n11 Both the Department and Plaintiffs have commented on this section of the Panel’s draft \nreport, highlighting the significance of this critical component of the Action Plan.  While the \nPanel stands by its finding of Compliance with respect to Section 1.3, we reiterate our intention \nto look beyond the narrow Compliance Measures currently in place to assess compliance with \nthis provision.  \n12 There were three Category 3 incidents at MCJ and one at TTCF. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 8 of 30   Page ID #:4305\n \n50% decrease in force incidents at IRC, a 2.4% decrease at MCJ, and a 28% decrease at TTCF in \nthe Second Quarter of 2020.13  The Department’s posted Self-Assessment reveals no Category 3 \nincidents in the Second Quarter of 2020.   Accordingly, the Department was in Compliance with \nSection 1.3 of the Action Plan at all of the Downtown Jail facilities in the Second Quarter of \n2020.   \n \n  The Department was in Compliance with Section 1.4 in the Eighth Reporting Period.  On \nMarch 4, 2020, Assistant Sheriff Chase, a Commander in Custody Operations and the Unit \nCommander responsible for CCSB made a presentation to the Board of Supervisors on the \nDepartment’s compliance with the Rosas Action Plan through the Fourth Quarter of 2019.     \n \n  B.  Management Visits \n \n  Sections 10.1 and 10.2 require the Department’s leadership to tour each of the jail \nfacilities and document those visits.  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that it  \nmaintained Compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 as of January 1, 2020, through March 17, \n2020,14 with 100% of the required visits by the Sheriff and Assistant Sheriff, as well as by the \nCaptains, Commanders, and Chiefs.15  The Department documented these visits, along with visits \nby Watch Commanders, as required by Section 10.2.  The Panel notes that the logs reflect very \nbrief visits to each of the Downtown jail facilities by the Sheriff on one day (March 3, 2020).  \nWhile we recognize that the Sheriff has a myriad of responsibilities, and COVID-19 restrictions \nlimited his access to the facilities during this reporting period, this is the second consecutive \nreporting period where we have noted the Sheriff’s limited presence at the jails.16  The Panel has \nreviewed the source documents provided by the Department and verified the other results \nreported by the Department. \n \nThe Department has asked the Panel to consider suspending the requirements of these \nprovisions during the pendency of the COVID-19 restrictions.  Plaintiffs suggest the Panel “hold \nfindings of compliance in abeyance” for this reporting period.  The Panel will not record a \nfinding for these provisions for the Second Quarter of 2020 or the upcoming Ninth Reporting \nPeriod due to the inability of the Department to safely conduct the required visits.  Beginning in \n                                                 \n13 As noted above, these marked decreases are likely attributable to the reduction in \ninmate population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n14 The Panel has been advised that Executive Tours for the ranks of Commander and \nabove were suspended on March 17, 2020, due to safety concerns related to COVID-19.  The \nPanel accepts this justification for the failure to conduct the required Executive visits in the \nSecond Quarter of 2020. \n15 Where there is more than one Unit Commander or Commander for a facility, the \nDepartment’s posted audit results combine the tours by all of assigned commanders for that \nfacility.   \n16 The Department notes that Unit Commanders frequently walk their facilities and relay \nany concerns to Custody Division Executives.  The Panel has no concerns in this regard – our \nconcern stems from the limited presence of the Sheriff at the jails.  On that issue, we endorse the \nPlaintiffs’ suggestion that the Department explore other options for greater direct involvement by \nthe Sheriff at the jails in the event physical visits continue to present health or safety issues. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 9 of 30   Page ID #:4306\n \nthe First Quarter of 2021, the Panel intends to assess compliance with these provisions, and will \nwork with the Parties to develop technology-based alternatives to in-person visits if current \npandemic conditions persist.     \n \n  C.  Rotations and Transfers \n \n  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require the Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotation \npolicies and rotate personnel as required by the policies, and (2) audit each unit’s compliance \nwith its rotation policies.  The Department’s Eighth Augmented Self-Assessment reports that it \nachieved 99% Compliance in the Eighth Reporting Period.  Each of the Downtown jail facilities \nhas a reasonably current Unit Order setting forth its rotation policy and the source documents \nindicate that most Department personnel are rotated in Compliance with those policies.  The \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 18.1 and Section 18.2 through June 30, 2020.  \n   \n  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that it maintained 100% Compliance \nwith Section 21.1 as of January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020.  The Panel has reviewed the \nDepartment’s source documents stating the reasons for Deputy transfers to Custody during the \nEighth Reporting Period, which reflect that no member was transferred or assigned to Custody as \na sanction for problematic conduct.   \n \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 of the Action Plan requires the Department to “have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]”  On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.  The Department’s Custody Force Manual satisfies Section 2.1 and includes specific \nprovisions that satisfy Sections 8.2 (Complaints of Retaliation), 17.2 (Pregnant Inmates), 20.1 \n(Types of Force), and 20.2 (Definition of Reactive Force) of the Action Plan.  The Department \nhas been in Compliance with these Sections since the Panel began monitoring the Department’s \ncompliance as of January 1, 2017. \n \n  The other recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department’s use of \nforce in Custody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Sections 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 10 of 30   Page ID\n#:4307\n \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate’s medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Section 20.3 requires the Department to adopt use of force policies for Planned Force \n(such as cell extractions). \n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department’s policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  During the Eighth Reporting Period, the Department advised the Panel of several \nproposed changes to the policies that were previously approved by the Panel.  The Panel was \ngiven the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes.  Although most of the proposed \nchanges were acceptable, the Panel has advised the Department that some modifications are \nnecessary and recommended other modifications to existing policy.  The Panel provided those \ncomments in writing to the Department on September 15, 2020.  The Panel has not yet been \nadvised by the Department whether the changes requested and suggested by the Panel have been \nor will be made.        \n \nA.  Review of Force Incidents \n \n  The Action Plan requires that the Panel review selected force packages each quarter to \nassess whether the use of force was in compliance with Sections 2.2 through 2.13, 4.1 through \n4.5, 9.2, 9.3, and 17.5 (the “Force Provisions”) of the Action Plan.  In prior reporting periods, the \nPanel has conducted a “vertical assessment” of each reviewed use of force to assess the \nreasonableness of the use of force “taking into consideration all of the applicable provisions of \nthe Action Plan” and also a “horizontal assessment of the Department’s compliance with each of \nthe applicable provisions of the Plan.”17  Plaintiffs had objected to the use of the vertical \nassessment.18  In its Seventh Report, the Panel decided to eliminate the vertical assessment and \nrely exclusively on its horizontal assessment to report the Department’s compliance with each of \nthe provisions of the Action Plan applicable to the Department’s use, reporting, and investigation \nof force by its members as requested by Plaintiffs.  The Panel continues with that approach in \nthis Report. \n \n  As has been the practice of the Panel, we reviewed the problematic incidents identified \nduring our review with Custody Commanders, and took into consideration their comments in \nreaching the conclusions set forth in this Report.  The Panel also met with Plaintiffs’ counsel to \nreview the force incidents identified as problematic by the Panel, as well as additional incidents \nPlaintiffs’ counsel considered problematic.  The input of the Department and Plaintiffs’ counsel \nwas extremely helpful in reviewing and assessing compliance with the Force Provisions. \n \n                                                 \n17 See Panel’s Fifth Report, p. 11 (emphasis in original). \n18 See Plaintiffs’ Response to Sixth Report, p. 3. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 11 of 30   Page ID\n#:4308\n \n  Plaintiffs have raised certain objections regarding the Panel’s reliance on the \nDepartment’s data and the Department’s classification of force incidents.  Plaintiffs’ Response, \npp. 3-4.  The Panel has noted in this report, as in prior reports, the steps it takes to review and \nverify the information provided by the Department.  There are situations, however, where the  \nPanel takes at face value representations made by the Department, including whether there have \nbeen any complaints involving use of force that were resolved with an “Appears Employee \nConduct Could Have Been Better” finding.19  There is no way for the Panel to independently \nverify the Department’s self-reporting in all areas without greatly increasing the staff and budget \nof the Panel, and the Department has given the Panel no reason to question the data it provides.  \nWith respect to the classification of force incidents, there has been no change in the policy \ndefinitions of the respective force categories, and the Panel has seen no evidence of systematic \nmisclassification in the dozens of force incidents we review each quarter. \n \n1.  First Quarter 2020 results \n \nPer the applicable Compliance Measures, the Panel selected 29 force incidents to review \nin the First Quarter of 2020 and received and reviewed 27 of those force packages.20  The \npackages were selected without input from the Department.  As has been the Panel’s approach in \npast reporting periods, the Panel selected for review the force incidents most likely to involve \nproblematic uses of force:  The Panel asked to review all Category 3 incidents21 (those involving \nforce that is likely to, or does, result in severe injuries) and most Category 2 incidents that \ninvolved strikes or kicks by Department personnel.  Thus, the universe of force incidents selected \nby the Panel included a disproportionate number of the more serious incidents involving the use \nof force by Department personnel.22    \n \nBased on the assessment of each provision across all of the force packages, the Panel \nconcluded that in the First Quarter of 2020 the Department was not in Compliance with the \nfollowing provisions of the Action Plan applicable to the use of force by its members:  Force \nprevention principles (Section 2.2), head strikes or kicking inmates (Section 2.6), and calling \nsupervisors to the scene before engaging with recalcitrant inmates (Section 2.7).   The Panel \nfound that the Department was in Compliance as of the First Quarter of 2020 with the remaining \nForce Provisions of the Action Plan. \n                                                 \n19 Plaintiffs suggests that the Panel improperly relied on the Department’s representation \nthat there were no such complaints in the reporting period in assessing compliance with Section \n3.5. \n20 Most of the force incidents reviewed by the Panel in the Eighth Reporting Period \noccurred during the latter half of 2019.   \n21 The Panel asked to review all four of the Category 3 incidents from 2019.  Only two of \nthose force packages were produced by the Department.  The Panel has been advised that the \nremaining Category 3 force packages from 2019 are still being reviewed by the Internal Affairs \nBureau. \n22 According to Use of Force statistics provided by the Department for the Eighth  \nReporting Period, 81.5% of the force incidents in the Downtown Jail Complex were either \nCategory 1 incidents or non-categorical incidents, 17.6 % were Category 2 incidents, and 0.9% \nwere Category 3 incidents.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 12 of 30   Page ID\n#:4309\n \n \n  As in the past, the Panel’s main concern was that Department members sometimes \nreacted too quickly and should have taken advantage of “time and distance” to de-escalate the \nsituation and avoid using force altogether or to plan a potentially safer use of force.  The failure \nto call a supervisor when confronted with a recalcitrant inmate is a corollary of the need for \nDepartment members to take more time before using force to control a recalcitrant inmate.  The \nDepartment has shared with the Panel its intention to focus on these issues in its ongoing use of \nforce refresher training required by the Action Plan, and has shown the Panel videos it has \ncreated to emphasize taking advantage of time and distance and calling a supervisor to help de-\nescalate an incident whenever possible or to direct deputies when de-escalation efforts have not \nserved as an effective deterrent.  The Panel appreciates the Department’s emphasis on improving \nin this area. \n \n  The other persistent problem regarding the use of force identified by the Panel is the \nimproper use of head strikes.23  The Panel found 10 cases in the First Quarter where personnel \ninappropriately struck an inmate in the head.  These incidents occurred at all three jail facilities \nunder a variety of different circumstances.  In many of the cases, the use of force was justifiable \nunder the circumstances, but the danger presented by the inmate (if any) did not justify a head \nstrike.  Head strikes should be reserved for situations where the inmate is “high risk/assaultive.”  \nYet, too often, head strikes are used as a control mechanism to subdue an aggressive inmate.  \nMedical science informs us that head blows are the ‘hidden injuries’ that create or exacerbate \nmental illness.  Agencies nationwide have long moved away from acceptance of head strikes.  \nWe encourage the Department to pay particular attention to this issue moving forward. \n \nPlaintiffs identify several cases in which force was used against restrained inmates, and \ncorrectly note that the Panel determined that the force used in certain of these cases was \nexcessive.  The Panel determined, however, based on a qualitative assessment of the totality of \ncases reviewed during the reporting period, that the Department was in compliance with Section \n2.5.   \n \n  Plaintiffs contend that the Department is out of compliance with Section 2.8, relating to \npreventing excessive force by other Department personnel.  The Panel believes Plaintiffs are \nmisconstruing this provision.  Section 2.8 requires Department members witnessing excessive \nforce to stop, reduce or control the force being used.  The cases cited by Plaintiffs involve \nincidents where multiple Department members were involved in efforts to restrain or subdue an \ninmate, and force was used by one or more of the Department members.  Some of these cases \ninvolved the use of excessive force, which the Panel has found to violate Section 2.2 and/or \nSection 2.6.  However, in the view of the Panel, none of these incidents presented a situation \n                                                 \n23  The Panel has recommended in prior reports that head strikes be removed from the \n“Personal Weapon” Category in the Department’s Use of Force policies.  Punches to the head \nshould instead become its own category of “Head Strikes,” and Deputies should be required to \nexplain specifically why a head strike was necessary or occurred.  Policy, training, force \npackages, and supervisor reviews should reflect this change.  The Department has not yet \nresponded to this recommendation. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 13 of 30   Page ID\n#:4310\n \nwhere one Department member had the opportunity to stop or reduce the force used by another \nDepartment member and failed to do so. \n \n2.  Second Quarter 2020 results \n \n  In the Second Quarter of 2020, the Panel reviewed 22 force incidents.  The Panel \nconcluded that the Department was not in compliance with the same provisions of the Action \nPlan noted with respect to the First Quarter of 2020:  Force prevention principles (Section 2.2), \nhead strikes or kicking inmates (Section 2.6), and calling supervisors to the scene before \nengaging with recalcitrant inmates (Section 2.7).  The Panel found that the Department was in \nCompliance as of the Second Quarter of 2020 with the remaining Force Provisions of the Action \nPlan. \n \n  The Panel reviewed only one cell extraction in the Second Quarter of 2020 to assess the \nDepartment’s compliance with specific provisions that are applicable to the use of force in those \ncircumstances.24  In that one case, the Panel found the Department’s use of force to be \nappropriate and reasonable, but the documentation did not establish compliance with the \nprovisions related to mental health professional on-scene to attempt to resolve the situation \n(Section 4.1), cooling off periods (Section 4.4), and mental health provider’s order (Section 4.5).  \nHowever, given the sample size of one, the Panel has not determined the Department’s \ncompliance with these provisions in the Second Quarter of 2020.  Instead, the Panel will consider \nthis case with others in the Ninth Reporting period.    \n \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining on use of force policies and on ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with \nrespect; and that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody-specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and in “identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.”  Section 12.1 requires that Custody Sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.    \n \n  The Department’s training results are subject to audit by the Panel’s auditors.  All of the \nDepartment’s reported results for the initial training of existing Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants and for new members set forth below have been verified by the Panel’s auditors based \nupon reviews of Department rosters and training records.  The auditors verified that the \nDepartment’s new members had received the required initial training from when it was first \noffered through the “as of” date reported by the Department for the completion of the initial \ntraining required for existing Deputies and Custody Assistants.  Accordingly, the Panel has \npreviously deemed the Department to be in compliance “as of” the date reported by the \nDepartment for the completion of the initial training required for existing personnel.  Beginning \n                                                 \n24 In the past, including the First Quarter of 2020, the Department has typically provided \nthe Panel at least three cell extraction cases each quarter. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 14 of 30   Page ID\n#:4311\n \nin this Eighth Reporting Period, the Department’s continuing compliance with the training \nprovisions is determined by its compliance with the refresher training required every year or \nevery other year.  \n \n  A.  Use of Force Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies and Custody Assistants in the \nDowntown Jail Complex had received the initial eight-hour use of force training required by \nSection 3.1.25  96% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required \nrefresher course through December 31, 2018.26  The refresher results for the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2018 were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 3.1 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Department’s \nAugmented Seventh Self-Assessment reported that 94% of the Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants received the required refresher training in 2019.  These results have been verified by \nthe Panel’s auditors.  The Panel will maintain the Compliance assessment from the Seventh \nReporting Period pending the year-end refresher training results for 2020.27  The final 2020 \nresults will be subject to verification by the Panel’s auditors. \n \n  B.  Ethics and Professionalism Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 95% of the existing personnel received the initial four-hour training \ncourse in ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with respect as required by Section 3.2.  \n95% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required refresher \ncourse through December 31, 2018.  The refresher results for the Third and Fourth Quarters of \n2018 were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department is in Compliance with Section \n3.2 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Seventh Augmented Self-Assessment \nreported that 95% of the Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants received the required refresher \ntraining in 2019, and that result was verified by the Panel’s auditors.  The Panel will maintain the \nCompliance assessment from the Seventh Reporting Period pending the year-end refresher \ntraining results for 2020.  The final 2020 results will be subject to verification by the Panel’s \nauditors. \n \n \n                                                 \n25 The use of force training approved by the Panel includes the custody-based use of force \nscenarios, constituting Compliance with Section 3.4.  \n26 The Panel granted the Department extensions for Deputies who received the basic use \nof force training in 2017 and 2018 for completion of the initial refresher courses.  The Panel \nexpects Department personnel to complete future refresher courses before the end of December \nof the years in which they are required.   \n27 The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that certain training classes were \ncancelled or modified due to COVID-19 safety restrictions as of March 17, 2020, and that it may \nbe difficult for the Department to train as many personnel during 2020 as would have been \ntrained absent the pandemic.  These limitations may impact the Department’s ability to comply \nwith training provisions of the Action Plan, and will be considered and addressed in the Panel’s \nNinth Report. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 15 of 30   Page ID\n#:4312\n \n  C.  Mental Health Training \n \n  As of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing Deputies at the Downtown Jail Complex and in \nthe mental health unit at the Century Regional Detention Facility (“CRDF”) received the 32 \nhours of training on Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution Training (DeVRT), including the \neight hours of identifying and working with mentally ill inmates, required by Sections 4.6 and \n4.7.  Also as of that date, 98% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF, and all Deputies at the North \nCounty Correctional Facility (“NCCF”), and the Pitchess Detention Center (“PDC”) jails \nreceived the eight hours training in identifying and working with mentally ill inmates required by \nSection 4.7.   \n \n  The Seventh Self-Assessment reported that for 2019, 98% of the Deputy Sheriffs and \nCustody Assistants received the required refresher training28 for Section 4.6 and 96% of the \nDeputies received the required four hours of refresher training for Section 4.7.  The refresher \nresults were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department was found to be in Compliance \nwith Section 4.6 and 4.7 as of December 31, 2019.  The Panel will maintain the Compliance \nassessment from the Seventh Reporting Period pending the year-end refresher training results for \n2020.  The final 2020 results will be subject to verification by the Panel’s auditors. \n \n  D.  New Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants \n \n  The Department has reported since the First Reporting Period that, beginning on July 1, \n2015, newly assigned Deputies have been required to complete a six-week Custody Operations \ncourse that includes training in use of force and ethics, professionalism and treating inmates with \nrespect, and new Custody Assistants have received training in these subjects during their \nAcademy training as required by Section 3.3.  The Department’s posted audit results reflect that \nthe Department has exceeded the 95% Compliance standard for new Deputies and new Custody \nAssistants for the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  These results have been verified by the \nPanel’s auditors and the Department is in Compliance with Section 3.3 through June 30, 2020. \n \n  The Department previously reported that 100% of new Deputies and Custody Assistants \nhad received the conflict resolution training (DeVRT) and training in “identifying and working \nwith mentally ill inmates” (“IIMI”) required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 in the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2019.  These results were verified by the Panel’s auditors and the Department was \nfound to be in Compliance with Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June 30, 2018 through December 31, \n2019.  The required DeVRT and IIMI training takes place after Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistant Academy graduations and prior to assuming duties at their unit of assignment.  The \nDepartment’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the new Deputies received the \nrequired training in the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  The Department further reports that \nthere were no Custody Assistant Academy graduations during the First or Second Quarters of \n2020.  The results for the First and Second Quarters of 2020 have been verified by the Panel’s \nauditors.  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 4.8 and 4.9 through June 30, 2020. \n \n                                                 \n28 Eight hours every other year for Section 4.6 and four hours every other year for Section \n4.7. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 16 of 30   Page ID\n#:4313\n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine “what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it ‘Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better;’ direct that the \nDepartment member undergo such additional training, counseling, or mentoring; and document \nthe action taken.”  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that there were no inmate \ngrievances against staff involving use of force where the disposition was that it “Appears \nEmployee Conduct Could Have Been Better.”  The Department is in Compliance with Section \n3.5 as of June 30, 2020.   \n   \n  Section 3.6 requires Unit Commanders to review new Department members within six \nmonths of being initially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary \nperiod.  Based upon a random selection of personnel records, the Department reports that 68% of \nthe new Department members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6 in the first six months of \n2020, which is below the 95% threshold for Compliance.  These results are consistent with the \nlackluster results from the Seventh Reporting Period, and suggest that the Corrective Action Plan \nand other measures implemented by the Department following prior non-compliant quarters were \nnot successful in ensuring compliance.  The Department reports in its Eighth Self-Assessment \nReport that further briefings have been conducted to explain to Unit Commanders at each facility \nthe importance of timely reviews.    \n \n  E.  Sergeant Training \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 90.4% of the Sergeants \nassigned to Custody as of October 1, 2016, had received the 16 hours of training in conducting \nuse of force investigations required by Section 12.1.  These results were verified by the Panel’s \nauditors.  The Department’s posted audit results report that 100% of the Sergeants newly \npromoted in Custody in the First Quarter of 2020 received the required training.  These results \nhave been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  The Department reports that the sole promoted \nSergeant in the Second Quarter of 2020 received the required training in October 2020, the \nearliest opportunity to do so in light of COVID-19 restrictions on in-person classes.  This \ntraining has been verified by the Panel’s auditors.  The resulting cumulative compliance for \nnewly promoted Sergeants through the Second Quarter of 2020 remains under the 95% \ncompliance threshold.   \n \n  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that the Department will submit its \nannual results for Sergeants who were required to receive refresher training in 2020 in the Ninth \nReporting Period.  These results will be subject to verification by the Panel's auditors.     \n \n   4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  Many of the recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are assessed by the \nPanel through a review of the completed force packages.  Other provisions are reported by the \nDepartment as follows:    \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 17 of 30   Page ID\n#:4314\n \n  Section 5.1 requires the Department to track use of force investigations, reviews, and \nevaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of \ndiscrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The Department reports that 100% of \nthe force incidents in the First Quarter of 2020 were timely entered into the database as \nrequired by Section 5.1, and 96% were timely entered in the Second Quarter of 2020, \nwhich is above the 95% threshold required for Compliance.   \n \n  Section 8.3 requires that investigations of grievances claiming that Department members \nused force to retaliate against inmates be timely evaluated by the Custody Force Review \nCommittee (“CFRC”).  The Department reports that it achieved Compliance with this \nprovision in the First Quarter of 2020, but did not achieve compliance in the Second \nQuarter of 2020 due to two of the seven grievances covered by this provision not being \npresented to the CFRC within 30 days of the Unit Commander’s evaluation.  The \nDepartment reports that it has provided further instruction to the custody facilities to \nimprove timeliness of review by CFRC. \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents.  The \nCompliance Measure requires that “95% of the investigations reviewed by CFRT were \nnot delayed beyond the period permitted by law for imposing discipline.”  The \nDepartment previously reported that it achieved Compliance with Section 11.1 in the \nSecond Quarter of 2018.  Because there were no use of force incidents reviewed by \nCFRT in which there was a finding of a policy violation or misconduct in either the Fifth,  \nSixth, Seventh, or Eighth Reporting Periods, the predicate for determining compliance \nwith Section 11.1 did not exist in those periods and the Department remains in \nCompliance.   \n \n  Section 13.1 requires the Department to “have a firm policy of zero tolerance for acts of \ndishonesty or failure to report uses of force.”  Sections 13.1 and 13.2 require the \ndocumentation of the reasons and reports to the Inspector General whenever the \nDepartment does not terminate a member who has been found to have been dishonest, \nused excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”).  The \nDepartment’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that in the First Quarter of 2020 a Custody \nAssistant was terminated for dishonesty in connection with an internal investigation.  The \nInspector General was advised of this action.  There were no incidents in the Second \nQuarter of 2020 that were subject to Section 13.1 and 13.2.  The Department is in \nCompliance with Sections 13.1 and 13.2 through June 30, 2020.29   \n  \n                                                 \n29 The Panel remains concerned that reviewed use of force packages sometimes reflect \nDeputy reports that are inaccurate and self-serving, but which are not treated as “dishonesty” or \n“integrity” issues by the Department.  See Seventh Report, p. 18.  The Panel is not ready to \nconclude, as urged by Plaintiffs in their response to a draft of this Report, that every failure to \ndiscipline a Deputy who writes an inaccurate report regarding a force incident constitutes a \nviolation of Section 13.1.  However, the Panel believes a more rigorous review of this issue by \nthe Department would improve accuracy and candor in use of force reports. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 18 of 30   Page ID\n#:4315\n \n  Sections 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of inmates for \ncriminal prosecution arising from incidents involving the use of force by Department \nmembers and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of “officer misconduct that may \namount to criminal violations.”  The Department reports 100% in Compliance with \nSection 14.1 in the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  With respect to Section 14.2, \nthere was one timely referral of a Department member for possible prosecution for \nalleged misconduct that may amount to a criminal violation in each of the First and \nSecond Quarters of 2020.   Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section \n14.2 as of the Third Quarter of 2018, through the Second Quarter of 2020.   \n \n   \n  A.  First Quarter 2020 Results \n \n  The Panel reviewed 27 completed force packages in the First Quarter of 2020 to assess \ncompliance with the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the reporting and investigation of \nforce incidents.  The Panel concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the \nfollowing provisions:  Commanders’ reviews (Section 5.2), unexplained discrepancies in reports \n(Section 5.3), location of inmate interviews (Section 12.2), the timeliness of force reports \n(Section 15.1), and the reporting of the observation of visible injuries or the lack of such injuries \n(Section 15.4).  In addition, the documentation provided by the Department was not sufficient for \nthe Panel to determine the Department’s compliance with the provision relating to the separation \nof Department personnel after a force incident (Section 15.6).  In order to achieve compliance \nwith Section 15.6, the supervisor must document that the members were separated and how this \nseparation was accomplished.  \n \n  As in the past, the Panel has found the Department out of compliance with Section 5.2, \nrelating to the evaluation of force incidents by appropriate Commanders, based on the fact that \nwe are not consistently seeing rigorous reviews across all levels of the Department.  We continue \nto see improper uses of force validated in the initial Supervisor’s review, and while the Watch \nCommander and Unit Commander reviews are more substantive and probing than we saw in the \nearly years of our monitoring, one or both Commander reviews often concur in the erroneous \nevaluation of the reviewing Sergeant.  This is an area where there has been improvement by the \nDepartment, but the Panel expects to see more consistent recognition of problematic uses of \nforce at all levels of review.   \n     \n  B.  Second Quarter 2020 Results \n \n  The Panel reviewed 22 completed force packages in the Second Quarter of 2020.  The \nPanel concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the following provisions:  \nCommanders’ reviews (Section 5.2), unexplained discrepancies in reports (Section 5.3), location \nof inmate interviews (Section 12.2), timeliness of force reports (Section 15.1), and failure to \nreport force by other members (Section 15.3).  In addition, the information provided by the \nDepartment was not, in many cases, sufficient for the Panel to determine the Department’s \ncompliance with the provision relating to the separation of Department personnel after a force \nincident (Section 15.6).    \n   \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 19 of 30   Page ID\n#:4316\n \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  The Action Plan requires extensive changes in how the Department handles inmate \ngrievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016, the Department issued a new “Inmate \nGrievance Manual” (Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual) to implement a new grievance \nsystem.  The Panel assessed the Department’s implementation of the new grievance system in \nthe Eighth Reporting Period as follows: \n \n  A.  Grievance Forms \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.6 require that separate forms for inmate grievances be reasonably \navailable to inmates and that the forms have specific check boxes.  Section 7.1 requires the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the \nDepartment’s Conflict Resolution Policy.30  The Panel has previously concluded that the forms \nmeeting the requirements of the Action Plan are reasonably available to inmates, and the \nDepartment remains in Compliance with those provisions relating to the availability of the \nrequired forms in printed or electronic format.   \n \n  One area of concern identified during this reporting period is the significant backlog in \nprocessing grievances filed against staff, particularly at MCJ.  During the first six months of \n2020, there were 264 complaints against staff that were received and assigned for review.  Only \n13 of those complaints had been resolved by the end of the Second Quarter of 2020 – fewer than \nthree cases per month.  The Department’s data suggests that the bottleneck is with the reviewing \nSergeants at MCJ.  The Panel understands that recent staffing cuts within Custody Operations \nmay be contributing to this backlog.  Regardless of the reason, the Department must improve its \nprocessing of complaints against staff.  The appropriate and prompt handling of these types of \ngrievances – perhaps more than any other type of grievance – is critical to maintaining an \nappropriate culture within the jails and giving credibility to the grievance process.  We \nunderstand that the Department has addressed this issue with its team at MCJ, and that the \nDepartment intends to take substantial steps to increase the number of Sergeants in Custody \nDivision in the First Quarter of 2021.  We look forward to seeing substantial improvement on \nthis issue in the coming months. \n \n  Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of the Action Plan require that use of force grievances and retaliation \ngrievances against staff are brought to the attention of Unit Commanders within 10 days and \nproperly handled.  Based upon a review of the relevant grievances in the randomly selected \nmonths, the Department reports that 100% of the use of force grievances were in Compliance \nwith Section 6.4 in the First and Second Quarters of 2020, which meets the threshold for \nCompliance.  The Department also reports that 100% of the retaliation grievances in the First \nand Second Quarters of 2020 were in Compliance with Section 6.5.  The source documents \n                                                 \n30 The Department reports that there were no grievances adjudicated by means of a \nConflict Resolution Meeting in the First Quarter of 2020 and two Conflict Resolution Meetings \nin the Second Quarter of 2020. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 20 of 30   Page ID\n#:4317\n \nposted by the Department for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 have been reviewed by the Panel, which \nverified that these grievances were handled appropriately.  \n \n  B.  Emergency Grievances      \n \n  Sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the Action Plan set forth specific requirements for the \ndetermination, handling, and notifications of non-medical emergencies.  Section 6.7 requires: (1) \nDeputies to send any grievance marked “emergency” to a supervisor for review “as soon as \npossible;\" (2) supervisors to determine if “the situation requires immediate action to protect the \nlife or safety of the inmate;” (3) supervisors to notify watch commanders/shift supervisors of any \nnon-medical emergencies; (4) Watch Commanders/shift supervisors to immediately confirm the \nemergencies exist and take action “to protect the inmates;” and (5) Watch Commanders/shift \nsupervisors to notify the inmate in writing about “what action was taken to address the \nemergency.”  The Compliance Measures require that 95% of the grievances marked as \nemergencies “be reviewed and handled as required by [Section] 6.7.”  It is implicit in Section 6.7 \nthat a supervisor’s determination that the situation requires immediate action and a Watch \nCommander’s confirmation that emergencies exist will be reasonable.  Section 6.8 requires that \nif the Department determines that a non-medical emergency does not exist, the Department must \nnotify the inmate that it will be handled as a non-emergency grievance and document why it was \ndetermined not to be an emergency.   \n \nBased upon the review of the grievances marked “emergency” in the month randomly \nselected by the Panel for the First Quarter of 2020, the Department reports there were only two \ngrievances that met the criteria of Section 6.7,31 and that both of these grievances were properly \nhandled under Section 6.7.32  The Panel has reviewed each of the 50 grievances produced from \nthe First Quarter of 2020.  The Panel agrees that the two grievances handled as emergencies were \nhandled consistent with Section 6.7.  However, the Panel is concerned that the Department may \nbe too quick to reject inmate characterizations of grievances as “emergencies” where there is a \npossibility of danger to the life or safety of the inmate.  In several cases, grievances were \ndowngraded to “non-emergent” upon initial review, but nevertheless promptly and appropriately \naddressed by the Department.  While the inmates’ claims of potential danger may be exaggerated \nin many of these cases, the seemingly reflexive response of downgrading the grievance, but then \npromptly addressing it, seems unnecessary and potentially dangerous.   \n \n                                                 \n31 The source documents provided by the Department reveal that there were more than 50 \ngrievances marked “emergency” by inmates during the selected month.  However, in assessing \ncompliance with Section 6.7, the Department appears to have reviewed only the two grievances \nduring the selected month that were properly characterized as emergent.  The grievances the \nDepartment treated as non-emergent appear to have been assessed in the context of Section 6.8 \ncompliance.  The Panel believes that the Section 6.7 assessment requires a review of whether the \n“downgrade” of a grievance marked “emergency” was proper, and has reviewed the \nDepartment’s Section 6.8 source materials to conduct this assessment. \n32 As part of its Section 6.8 analysis, the Department concluded that all 50 of the \nreviewed grievance were properly downgraded to non-emergent. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 21 of 30   Page ID\n#:4318\n \nBoth the Department and Plaintiffs have commented on the Panel’s observations \nregarding the treatment of emergency grievances, with the Department offering clarification \nregarding its procedures for evaluating such grievances and noting its practice of treating as an \nemergency any complaint that identifies “potentially dangerous” concerns or issues.  The Panel \nreiterates its observations that the Department consistently addresses grievances in a timely \nmanner, but, in some cases, has adopted an overly narrow view of whether the concern raised is \n“potentially dangerous.”  We believe that close cases should be resolved in favor of treating the \ngrievance as an emergency. \n \nFor the Second Quarter of 2020, the Department reviewed 50 grievances that were \nhandled as emergent33 and found that all of them were properly handled.  The Department also \nreviewed 50 grievances that were marked as “emergency” but handled as non-emergent and \nfound that 100% of the grievances were properly downgraded.  The Panel has reviewed the \nsource documents related to the selected grievances and determined that the grievances handled \nas emergent and those downgraded to non-emergent in the Second Quarter of 2020 were \nappropriately handled by the Department. \n \nAccordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 6.7 and Section 6.8 for the \nperiod January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020.   \n \n  C.  Inmate Grievance Coordinator \n \n  During the Seventh Reporting Period, the Department appointed a new Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator to continue implementation of the grievance provisions of the Rosas Action Plan \nand the use of technology to receive and track the Department handling of inmate grievances.  \nThe Panel met with the Inmate Grievance Coordinator twice during the Eighth Reporting Period \nto discuss the Department’s implementation of its grievance policies and procedures.  \n \nSection 6.9 requires that emergency grievances be forwarded to the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator.  Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 require the Inmate Grievance Coordinator to track the \nDepartment’s handling of inmate grievances, provide a monthly report to the Unit Commander \nand senior management in Custody on the status of inmate grievances, and analyze inmate \ngrievances for problematic trends.  The Department provided documentation to the Panel \nshowing that for the First and Second Quarters of 2020, the Inmate Grievance Coordinator \nreceived the information about emergency grievances required by Section 6.9 and prepared \ndetailed reports for managers as required by Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.  The Department is in \nCompliance with Sections 6.9, 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 through June 30, 2020. \n \n  As previously reported, the Panel believes that the structure of the grievance system \ndeveloped by the Department under the direction of an Inmate Grievance Coordinator is \n                                                 \n33 The marked increase in the number of grievances handled as “emergent” in the Second \nQuarter of 2020 is due to a policy decision by the Department to handle as an emergency any \ngrievance that referenced COVID-19.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 22 of 30   Page ID\n#:4319\n \neffectively and efficiently handling inmate grievances and requests for service and that the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 6.16.34 \n \n  D.  Handling of Grievances \n \nSections 6.10 and 6.12 require that grievances be collected daily, logged in, and tracked \nin an inmate grievance database.  The Compliance Measures for these provisions require that the \nDepartment review the first 25 consecutive grievances from MCJ and the first 25 consecutive \ngrievances from TTCF during the randomly selected month to determine if they were collected, \nreviewed and tracked as required.  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that 100% \nof the reviewed grievances were collected and reviewed within 24 hours and handled as required \nin both the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  The source documents posted by the Department \nreflect that, while the 50 reviewed grievances were collected in a timely manner, there were \nnumerous days during the selected months where grievances were not collected from boxes at \nboth facilities.35  Accordingly, the Department is not in Compliance with Section 6.10 for the \nFirst and Second Quarters of 2020. \n \nThe Department has objected to this finding of non-compliance as unfair because it is \nbased on information outside that required to be provided under the applicable Compliance \nMeasure.  (Department’s Response, pp. 6-7.)  The Panel disagrees.  The Department’s failure to \ncomply with Section 6.10, which requires that grievances be collected on at least a daily basis, is \nundisputed.  Although the Revised Monitoring Plan and Compliance Measures sets forth a \nmechanism for assessing compliance with this provision, it also states that “[t]he Monitors \nreserve the right . . . to request and review additional records and categories of records as \nnecessary to assess the Department’s Compliance with specific provisions of the Plan.”  The \nrecords relied upon by the Panel to assess compliance with Section 6.10 were appropriately \nconsidered.   \n \n  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that 100% of the grievances at both \nMCJ and TTCF in the randomly selected months in the First and Second Quarters of 2020 were \nentered into the database as required by Section 6.12.  The source documents for these results \nwere available to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 6.12 through June 30, 2020.  \n                                                 \n34 As they have in the past, Plaintiffs contend that the Department is out of compliance \nwith Section 6.16 because it has not implemented a centralized grievance unit.  For the reasons \nset forth in the Seventh Report, the Panel disagrees.  See Seventh Report, p. 21. \n35 The Panel notes that the Compliance Measure for Section 6.10 may not yield data \nsufficient to assess compliance with this provision.  For example, the first 25 consecutive \ngrievances at MCJ for the selected months were collected within the first several days of the \nmonth.  If, as was the case during the First and Second Quarters of 2020, MCJ timely collected \ngrievances from its collection boxes in the first week of the month, but failed to collect \ngrievances on several days during the remainder of the month, the review called for by the \nCompliance Measure would not reveal that shortcoming.  The Panel appreciates the Department \nproviding collection data beyond that required by the Compliance Measure to allow the Panel to \nproperly assess the Department’s collection efforts. \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 23 of 30   Page ID\n#:4320\n \n \n  Section 6.11 requires that the Custody Division Manual provide that failing to comply \nwith Department policies requiring proper handling of inmate grievances may be cause for \ndiscipline.  The Department reports that there were two claims that Department members \nimproperly handled inmate grievances resolved during the Eighth Reporting Period.  In neither \ncase was the member found to have violated the grievance policy.  Accordingly, the Department \nis in Compliance with Section 6.11 through June 30, 2020.    \n \n  Section 8.1 prohibits Department personnel from retaliating against inmates.  The \nDepartment posted the results of the investigations approved by Unit Commanders in the \nrandomly selected months and the number of anti-retaliation grievances received and \ninvestigated in the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  It reports that in the First Quarter of 2020 \nthere were six grievances alleging retaliation resolved in the selected month, with no findings of \na violation of the anti-retaliation policy.  For the entire quarter, there were 56 anti-retaliation \ngrievances received, two investigations completed, and no founded violations of the anti-\nretaliation policy.  In the Second Quarter of 2020 there were four grievances alleging retaliation \nresolved in the selected month, with no findings of a violation of the anti-retaliation policy.  For \nthe entire quarter, there were 52 anti-retaliation grievances received, two investigations \ncompleted, and no founded violations of the anti-retaliation policy.  The Panel reviewed the \ninvestigative summaries that were posted by the Department of the anti-retaliation grievances \nthat Unit Commanders deemed unfounded in the random months of February and May 2020 and \nagrees with the Commanders’ assessments.  The Panel finds that the Department has maintained \nCompliance with Section 8.1 through June 30, 2020. \n \nAlthough the Department continues to make progress in its handling of inmate grievances \nand requests, the Panel is disappointed that the Department appears to have lost momentum with \nrespect to the use of technology to electronically receive and track the Department’s handling of \ninmate grievances within the jails.  The plan was to install iPads in tamper-proof cases within the \nliving units and to automate the grievance process, retaining paper grievance forms for those \ninmates that preferred them.  Prior to installing grievance software, the iPads in TTCF were \noutfitted with inmate request and information software so that questions about an inmate’s \naccount, court dates, medical appointments, and much more could be accessed and answered by \ninmates without staff involvement.  That was a huge success, with hundreds of thousands of \ninmate inquiries answered immediately, which removed a huge workload from frontline staff and \neliminated a great deal of inmate frustration when staff does not have time to get answers to \nthose questions.  The Panel was most optimistic about the Department expanding the program to \nthe other facilities and enhancing them with the grievance system capabilities, but a combination \nof technological challenges, indecision regarding the appropriate operating system and delays \ndue to COVID-19 and other health issues within the jails appears to have set the entire initiative \nback.  The Department reports that it continues to press forward on this initiative.  The Panel \nexpects the Department to re-double its efforts to more widely implement the electronic tablet \nprogram throughout the Downtown Jail Complex. \n   \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 24 of 30   Page ID\n#:4321\n \n  E.  Deadlines    \n \n  Sections 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, and 6.20 set forth the deadlines for filing use of force and \nPREA grievances,36 the Department’s initial responses, inmates’ right to appeal, and the \nDepartment’s notifications of the results of the investigations.  The Department’s Eighth Self-\nAssessment reports that it adhered to the deadlines for these grievances in both the First and \nSecond Quarters of 2020.  The Panel agrees that the Department is in Compliance with Sections \n6.17, 6.18 and 6.20 through June 30, 2020.  As previously noted by the Panel, however, the \nDepartment reports on the timeliness of responses by Correctional Health Services to inmate \ngrievances against the medical staff  (e.g., lack of a timely response to a request for medical \nservice), a metric required in order to achieve Compliance with Section 6.19.  The Panel \nrecognizes that Jail Health Services is under a separate County agency, but has suggested for \nsome time that representatives from the Health Department participate in the grievance review \nwith Department members and the Panel.  That has not happened, but the health grievance \nnotifications continue to fall substantially below compliance. \n   \n  F.  Communications with Inmates \n \n  The Eighth Self-Assessment also reports that the Department adhered to the deadlines for \nadvising inmates of the results of adjudications as required by Section 7.2 for First Quarter \n(95%) and the Second Quarter (100%) of 2020.  The posted source documents for these results \nwere available to, and reviewed by, the Panel.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance \nwith Section 7.2 through June 30, 2020.  \n   \n  Section 7.3 requires the Department to “ensure that there are adequate avenues for \nconstructive prisoner-staff communication[.]”  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports \nthat the Department was in Compliance with Section 7.3 during both the First and Second \nQuarters of 2020.  The Department provided logs of Town Hall meetings at MCJ and TTCF \nduring the randomly selected months the First and Second Quarters of 2020 that included Town \nHall meetings in special housing units as well as in General Population housing units.  Based on \nthese logs, the Panel is of the view that the Department has achieved Compliance with Section \n7.3 for the period January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020. \n     \n6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include “a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints” identified in this recommendation.  \nThe Department included such a separate section in the Manual, and is in Compliance with this \nrequirement of Section 17.1, effective December 1, 2015. \n   \n  Section 17.3 requires medical examinations of inmates placed in safety chairs and \nSection 17.4 requires safety checks of inmates in fixed restraints every twenty minutes.  The \nCompliance Measures require the Department to provide the Panel “with a list of incidents in \nwhich inmates were placed in a Safety Chair, restrained to a fixed object for more than 20 \n                                                 \n36 Section 6.18 provides that there is no deadline for filing PREA grievances.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 25 of 30   Page ID\n#:4322\n \nminutes, subjected to security restraints for an extended length of time” in the Downtown Jail \nComplex.37   \n \n  During the Eighth Reporting Period, the Department provided the Inmate Safety Chair \nSecurity Check Logs for use of the safety chair and Fixed Restraint Logs at Downtown Jail \nComplex in the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  The Inmate Safety Chair Security Check \nLogs and Fixed Restraint Logs reflect that Department personnel are, in the majority of cases, \nchecking on the inmates every twenty minutes as required by Section 17.4, although in some \ncases the Deputies did not provide any details regarding the inmate’s condition, the authorization \nfor keeping the inmate in the chair for more than two hours, or the release time.  Further, there is \nno indication that medical professionals are performing any vitals checks even though inmates \nare often in the safety chairs for several hours while they are transported to court, attend the court \nproceedings, and are then transported back to the facilities.  Periodic vitals checks are necessary \nin order to establish Compliance with Section 17.3 even if the inmate does not struggle and force \nis not used to place the inmate in the chair.   \n \n  Section 17.10 provides that medication cannot be used solely for security purposes.  The \nDepartment’s posted Self-Assessment, confirmed by a log of the Administration of Involuntary \nMedications, reports that the overwhelming majority of involuntary medications were pursuant \nto court orders and there were no instances in which medication was used solely for security \npurposes in the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  Accordingly, the Department has been in \nCompliance with Section 17.10 through June 30, 2020.  \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Section 19.1 requires the Department to develop an Early Warning System to identify \npotentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel approved the \nEmployee Review System (“ERS”) in July 2018, and it was implemented by the Department as a \npilot program in the Downtown Jail Complex on August 1, 2018, and in the rest of the jail \nfacilities as of November 1, 2018.  The Department has been in Compliance with Section 19.1 \nin the Downtown Jail Complex since August 1, 2018.   \n \n  Section 19.2 requires Compliance Lieutenants to review monthly reports generated by the \nERS and notify Unit Commanders and the Assistant Sheriff for Custody of the results within \nspecified time periods.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, Compliance Lieutenants must \nnotify the Unit Commander and Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations 90% of the time within \n10 days after reviewing monthly reports generated by the Early Warning System and 95% of the \ntime within 30 days.  The Department’s Eighth Self-Assessment reports that the Department \nachieved Compliance with Section 19.2 in the First and Second Quarters of 2020 at all three \n                                                 \n37 Sections 17.6 through 17.9 govern the application of multi-point restraints, which the \nPanel has been advised by the Department it does not use. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 26 of 30   Page ID\n#:4323\n \nDowntown jail facilities.38  Based on the source documents provided, the Panel concludes that \nthe Department was in Compliance with Section 19.2 for the First and Second Quarters of 2020.  \n \nSection 19.3 requires Unit Commanders to determine whether problematic employees \nshould be placed on a performance mentoring program.  For each potentially problematic \nDepartment member identified through the Early Warning System, the Unit Commander must \nconsult with the appropriate Chief and document the reasons why any problematic members are \nnot placed on a performance mentoring program.  Based on the documents provided, it appears \nthat Unit Commanders are notifying their appropriate Chief of those instances in which \nemployees are not placed on a performance mentoring program, but they are not engaging in the \nrequired consultation with the Chief.  Moreover, Unit Commanders at MCJ are not properly \ndocumenting the reasons identified employees are not being placed on performance mentoring \nprograms.  Instead, MCJ tends to assign any employee identified by the EWS to some form of \nremedial training, either “force concepts” or “use of force refresher.”39  The only exceptions \nappear to be situations in which there is an administrative investigation in progress.  The Panel \nfinds the Department to be out of compliance on Section 19.3.    \n                                                 \n38 The Department reports a delay in providing the January 2020 monthly report for \nTTCF to the Division Chief; however, this delay did not impact its compliance with the Section \n19.2 deadlines. \n39 The Panel has previously expressed concern about lack of clarity regarding the \nspecifics of the “force concepts” training assigned by MCJ Unit Commanders.  See Seventh \nReport, p. 25, n.36 (noting that the annual refresher course required by Section 3.1 is not \nappropriate as a remedial measure for individuals with disproportionate number of use of force \nsituations).   \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 202   Filed 01/04/21   Page 27 of 30   Page ID\n#:4324\n \n          APPENDIX \n \nNO.

Introduction\n25 Presently before the court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class\n26 Certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Having considered the\n27 submissions of the parties and heard oral argument, the court\n28 grants the motion and adopts the following order.  The court notes \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 2 of 11   Page ID #:1321\n1 that the threshold for satisfying class certification requirements\n2 is relatively low.  See Parkinson v. Hyundai Motor Am., 258 F.R.D.\n3 580, 594 (C.D. Cal. 2008).  The granting of this class\n4 certification motion is a procedural step allowing this matter to\n5 go forward.  It is not intended, and does not constitute an opinion\n6 on the ultimate merits of the lawsuit.\n7 The court has great confidence in the leadership and integrity\n8 of both sides to this dispute.  The parties have proved to be\n9 effective partners in crafting cooperative solutions to issues\n10 raised in other, related matters before this court.  Nothing in\n11 this order shall be read to discourage the parties from continuing\n12 to pursue collaborative efforts to address jail-related matters of\n13 mutual concern.\n14 I. Background \n15 The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has the\n16 responsibility of running the largest and likely most challenging\n17 jail system in the country.  It is a system which admits and\n18 discharges over 150,000 inmates a year and is responsible, among\n19 other matters, for delivering inmates to courthouses located\n20 throughout the county.  The inmate population is comprised of\n21 individuals charged with crimes ranging from misdemeanors to\n22 homicides, and includes pre-trial detainees, inmates who have been\n23 convicted and sentenced, and, under California’s “realignment”\n24 program, an increasing number of state prisoners.\n25 A substantial portion of the inmate population has serious\n26 medical and mental health needs, disability issues, and drug and\n27 alcohol dependency problems.  While many inmates are non-violent or\n28 low-level offenders, a significant number are hard-core gang\n2\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 3 of 11   Page ID #:1322\n1 members or present other serious security threats.  Inmates are\n2 often housed in outdated facilities that are long past their life\n3 cycles, and were never designed to accommodate inmates as numerous\n4 and complex as today’s jail population.  It is in this context,\n5 against a challenging backdrop of dwindling fiscal resources and an\n6 increasing inmate population, that the Sheriff’s Department has\n7 endeavored to fulfill its custodial responsibilities to both\n8 inmates and the public. \n9 The American Civil Liberties Union’s mission, in part, is to\n10 protect inmates’ constitutional rights, and further to ensure that\n11 inmates are housed in a safe, humane environment that provides\n12 opportunities for rehabilitation.  Consistent with these interests,\n13 the ACLU’s monitors have, by order of this court and with the\n14 cooperation of the Sheriff’s Department, had access to the jail,\n15 inmates, and senior Sheriff’s Department jail supervisors.\n16 The Sheriff’s Department and the ACLU have a long history of\n17 both litigation and collaboration on jail-related matters.  During\n18 some of that history, this court has decided contested issues and\n19 worked with the parties to identify and resolve issues of mutual\n20 concern, often without the need of formal litigation.  The Los\n21 Angeles County Office of Independent Review has also been of great\n22 assistance to the court and the parties in resolving disputes.\n23 Here, the ACLU, on behalf of Plaintiffs, has presented\n24 evidence to the court and to the Sheriff’s Department of alleged\n25 instances of deputy-on-inmate and inmate-on-inmate altercations. \n26 The ACLU asserts that such examples are the result of deficiencies\n27 in the management of the jail system.  (First Amended Complaint ¶¶\n28 3, 13.)\n3\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 4 of 11   Page ID #:1323\n1 The Sheriff’s Department has acknowledged the ACLU’s concerns,\n2 and has made commendable efforts to implement positive jail reforms\n3 and new initiatives, such as the establishment of new investigatory\n4 and management task forces.  The ACLU has made significant\n5 contributions to these reform efforts.  The court has no doubt that\n6 the Sheriff’s Department and the ACLU sincerely share the common\n7 goal of making the downtown Los Angeles jail the best possible\n8 facility.\n9 The court recognizes that, while the Sheriff’s Department and\n10 ACLU continue to work together to achieve this common goal,\n11 differences may arise requiring a judicial resolution.  This\n12 lawsuit is a vehicle by which the plaintiffs may seek relief. \n13 Here, Plaintiffs seek only declaratory and injunctive relief on\n14 behalf of themselves and other current and future inmates in the\n15 downtown Los Angeles Jail Complex.1  (FAC ¶¶ 3, 215.)  The\n16 plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages.\n17 III. Legal Standard\n18 The party seeking class certification bears the burden of\n19 showing that each of the four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at\n20 least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) are met.  See Hanon v.\n21 Dataprods. Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508-09 (9th Cir. 1992).  Rule 23(a)\n22 sets forth four prerequisites for class certification:\n23 (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members\nis impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact\n24 common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative  parties  are  typical  of  the  claims  or\n25 defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties\n26\n27\n1 The Jail Complex is comprised of three interconnected\nfacilities: Men’s Central Jail, Twin Towers Correctional Facility,\n28\nand the Inmate Reception Center (collectively, “the Jails”).\n4\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 5 of 11   Page ID #:1324\n1 will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass.\n2\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see also Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508. \n3\nThese four requirements are often referred to as numerosity,\n4\ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.  See General Tel. Co.\n5\nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982).  In determining the\n6\npropriety of a class action, the question is not whether the\n7\nplaintiff has stated a cause of action or will prevail on the\n8\nmerits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 are\n9\nmet.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178\n10\n(1974).  This court, therefore, considers the merits of the\n11\nunderlying claim to the extent that the merits overlap with\n12\nthe Rule 23(a) requirements, but will not conduct a “mini-\n13\ntrial” or determine at this stage whether Plaintiffs could\n14\nactually prevail.   Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d\n15\n970, 981, 983 n.8 (9th Cir. 2011).\n16\nIV. Discussion\n17\nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)\n18\n1. Numerosity\n19\nPlaintiffs must first demonstrate that “the class is so\n20\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed.\n21\nR. Civ. P. Rule 23(a)(1).  The Jails currently house\n22\nthousands of inmates, and are certain to house many more in\n23\nthe future.  The court therefore agrees with Plaintiffs’\n24\nundisputed assertion that the numerosity requirement has been\n25\nsatisfied.\n26\n2. Commonality\n27\n28\n5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 6 of 11   Page ID #:1325\n1 Second, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate that “there are\n2 questions of law or fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ.\n3 P. 23(a)(2).  “Rule 23(a)(2) has been construed permissively.\n4 All questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy\n5 the rule. The existence of shared legal issues with divergent\n6 factual predicates is sufficient . . . .”  Hanlon v. Chrysler\n7 Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998).  Indeed, “even a\n8 single common question will do,” so long as that question has\n9 the capacity to generate a common answer “apt to drive the\n10 resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\n11 Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551, 2556 (2011) (citations, internal\n12 quotations, and alterations omitted).\n13 Defendant argues that the commonality requirement is\n14 lacking here because “most class members have not been harmed\n15 in any way,” and that the “common denominator” of having been\n16 subjected to the risk of misconduct is insufficient.  (Opp.\n17 at 4-5.)  In a civil rights suit such as this one, however,\n18 “commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a\n19 system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the\n20 putative class members.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849,\n21 868 (9th Cir. 2001) abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v.\n22 California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005).  Under such circumstances,\n23 individual factual differences among class members pose no\n24 obstacle to commonality.  Id.; see also Spalding v. City of\n25 Oakland, No. C11-2867 THE, 2012 WL 994644 at *2 (N.D. Cal.\n26 March 23, 2012).\n27 Here, Plaintiffs contend that Sheriff’s department\n28 supervisors knew of, and were deliberately indifferent to, a\n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 7 of 11   Page ID #:1326\n1 pattern or practice of deputies using or threatening violence\n2 against inmates and facilitating inmate-on-inmate violence. \n3 As a result, Plaintiffs assert, all class members are at\n4 significant risk of excessive violence at the hands of\n5 deputies.  Resolution of these common questions is likely to\n6 yield a common answer to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\n7 issues Plaintiffs have raised on behalf of all inmates.  Rule\n8 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement is, therefore, satisfied.\n9 3. Typicality\n10 Rule 23(a) also requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that\n11 “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\n12 typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R.\n13 Civ. P. 23(a)(3). “[R]epresentative claims are ‘typical’ if\n14 they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class\n15 members; they need not be substantially identical.”   Hanlon,\n16 150 F.3d at 1020.  The complaint alleges that named Plaintiff\n17 Rosas was threatened by Sheriff’s deputies after witnessing a\n18 display of excessive force against another inmate, and was\n19 later himself the target of violence.  (FAC ¶¶ 220-223.)  The\n20 complaint also alleges that named Plaintiff Goodwin was\n21 physically assaulted by deputies without provocation.  (FAC\n22 ¶¶ 228-231.)  While the precise nature of the injuries\n23 suffered by the named Plaintiffs may differ from those\n24 suffered by other class members, the complaint alleges that\n25 the same pattern and practice of violence, and deliberate\n26 indifference thereto, exposes every class member, including\n27 the named Plaintiffs, to the same risk of violent attack. \n28\n7\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 8 of 11   Page ID #:1327\n1 Plaintiffs’ claims are therefore typical of the claims of\n2 absent class members.\n3 4. Adequacy\n4 Finally, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that \"the\n5 representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\n6 interests of the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n7 “Resolution of two questions determines legal adequacy: (1)\n8 do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts\n9 of interest with other class members and (2) will the named\n10 plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously\n11 on behalf of the class?”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.\n12 Defendant points to no conflict of interest among\n13 Plaintiffs’ counsel, but asserts that counsel is nevertheless\n14 inadequate by dint of alleged misconduct in a related case. \n15 (Opp. at 5.)  Defendant’s contention is without merit.\n16 Defendant also argues that named Plaintiffs Goodwin and\n17 Rosas are inadequate class representatives because they have\n18 not shown that they are likely to suffer from unlawful\n19 deputy-on-inmate violence in the future, and therefore lack\n20 Article III standing.2  (Opp. At 6-7.)  In order to\n21 demonstrate an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing,\n22 a plaintiff must demonstrate an “invasion of a legally\n23 protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized,\n24 and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” \n25 D’Lil v. Best W. Encina Lodge & Suites, 538 F.3d 1031, 1036\n26\n27\n2 This argument also serves as the basis for Defendant’s\nseparately filed Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amended\n28\nComplaint (Dkt. No. 45).\n8\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 9 of 11   Page ID #:1328\n1 (9th Cir. 2008), citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\n2 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  Defendant argues that the named\n3 Plaintiffs have not shown an imminent harm.\n4 To support his argument, Defendant relies primarily upon\n5 City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  In Lyons,\n6 a plaintiff sought injunctive relief after police officers\n7 allegedly applied a chokehold on the plaintiff at a traffic\n8 stop, without provocation.  Lyons, 461 U.S. at 97.   The\n9 Court held that because the plaintiff could not show a real\n10 and immediate threat that he would again be stopped and\n11 placed in a chokehold, he could not make a showing of\n12 irreparable injury and, therefore, lacked standing to pursue\n13 injunctive relief.  Id. at 105, 111.\n14 Lyons, however, is readily distinguishable.  Unlike the\n15 plaintiff in Lyons, who could do no more than speculate that\n16 he might someday once again interact with law enforcement\n17 officers, Plaintiffs here remain incarcerated in the Jails,\n18 and will necessarily come into frequent contact with\n19 Sheriff’s deputies, including some of the very deputies who\n20 are alleged to have engaged in unlawful violent activity. \n21 Furthermore, Plaintiffs here have alleged a widespread\n22 pattern of violence and indifference to that violence,\n23 supported by numerous declarations from inmates, experts, and\n24 civilian witnesses.  Where defendants have engaged in a\n25 pattern of injurious acts in the past, “there is a sufficient\n26 possibility that they will engage in them in the near future\n27 to satisfy the ‘realistic repetition’ requirement” necessary\n28 to demonstrate an actual injury.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 861;\n9\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 10 of 11   Page ID #:1329\n1 see also LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1324 (9th Cir.\n2 1985) (distinguishing Lyons from case involving a standard\n3 pattern of unconstitutional behavior).  Having alleged a\n4 pattern of unlawful behavior that is likely to recur, the\n5 named Plaintiffs here have demonstrated injury in fact, and\n6 are adequate class representatives.\n7 B. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)\n8 A party seeking class certification must also\n9 demonstrate that at least one of the following three\n10 conditions is satisfied: (1) the prosecution of separate\n11 actions would create a risk of: (a) inconsistent or varying\n12 adjudications, or (b) individual adjudications dispositive of\n13 the interests of other members not a party to those\n14 adjudications; (2) the party opposing the class has acted or\n15 refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class;\n16 or (3) questions of law or fact common to the members of the\n17 class predominate over any questions affecting only\n18 individual members, and a class action is superior to other\n19 available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of\n20 the controversy.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b); Dukes v.\n21 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 580 (9th Cir. 2010) (en\n22 banc).\n23 As noted above, Plaintiffs here seek certification under\n24 Rule 23(b)(2).  Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have\n25 provided no evidence whatsoever that Rule 23(b)(2) is\n26 satisfied.  (Opp. at 3.)  The FAC clearly alleges, however,\n27 that Sheriff’s command and supervisory staff have been and\n28 remain aware of the alleged pattern and practice of unlawful\n10\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 54    Filed 06/07/12   Page 11 of 11   Page ID #:1330\n1 violence and are deliberately indifferent to it.  The\n2 complaint further alleges that multiple deputies ignored\n3 named Plaintiff Rosas’ requests for a complaint form.  (FAC ¶\n4 223.)  Plaintiffs have also submitted expert declarations\n5 stating that Defendant has failed to rein in deputies’\n6 abusive behavior.  (See, e.g., Declaration of Thomas Parker\n7 in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶\n8 10).  In light of these allegations, the court is satisfied\n9 that Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that the party\n10 opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\n11 generally applicable to the class.\n12 V. Conclusion\n13 For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s Motion to\n14 Certify Class is GRANTED.3  The court hereby certifies a class\n15 comprised of all present and future inmates confined in the\n16 Jail Complex in downtown Los Angeles, pursuant to Federal\n17 Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  The court reiterates that\n18 the certification of the plaintiff class has no bearing on\n19 the viability or veracity of Plaintiffs’ claims.  The court\n20 remains available to assist the parties in mediating\n21 disputes, while recognizing the possibility that further\n22 litigation may also be necessary. \n23 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n24\n25 Dated: June 7, 2012\nDEAN D. PREGERSON\n26 United States District Judge\n27\n3 For the reasons discussed in Section III.A.4, supra,\n28\nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss the FAC is DENIED.\n11",

Any such disclosure shall \n11 be construed as a violation of this Order.  \n12   D.  Inadvertent Disclosure.   \n13 If the Designating Party inadvertently produces any Confidential \n14 Information without designating it as such, it may be remedied by:  (1) promptly \n15 notifying the other parties of the error; and (2) providing a substitute copy of the \n16 Confidential Information with a proper legend.  In that event, the parties receiving \n17 the inadvertently produced undesignated Confidential Information will:  (1) return \n18 the previously produced Confidential Information and destroy all copies thereof; \n19 and (2) if the Party had already disseminated the Confidential Information to any \n20 person, the Party will notify all such persons in writing of the need to promptly \n21 return such Confidential Information and not to further disseminate it.   \n22 E.  Additional Limitations on the Use of Confidential Information.   \n23 So long as the confidentiality obligations imposed by this Order remain in \n24 place (or as required by subsequent order of this Court): \n25   the Confidential Information may be used solely for the settlement or \n26 litigation of this action and may not be used for any other purpose of \n27 any kind, including for the litigation any other action (related or \n28\n   6 \n \nRosas v Baca – Rosas Proposed Order re DRAFT protective order\n \n\n \n1 otherwise), except to the extent authorized by subsequent order of this \n2 Court; \n3   No Confidential Information or copies thereof, nor any transcript, \n4 quotation, paraphrase, summary, or other description containing \n5 Confidential Information, shall be reproduced, disseminated, or \n6 disclosed to any person or used for any purpose except in accordance \n7 with this Stipulation and Order or by further Order of the Court.

No Waiver of Objections.   \n5 Nothing in this Stipulation and Order constitutes any decision by the Court \n6 concerning discovery disputes or the admission into evidence of any specific \n7 document or testimony or liability for payment of any costs of production or \n8 reproduction of documents.  This Order also does not constitute a waiver by any \n9 Party of any right to object to discovery or admission into evidence of any \n10 document, record, testimony or other information that is subject to this Order.  \n11 Nor does Defendant waive any privileges that may or may not apply, including, \n12 but not limited to, the investigatory files or official information privileges, see, \n13 e.g., Weiner v. FBI, 943 F. 2d 972, 985 (9th Cir. 1991), or Miller v. Pancucci, 141 \n14 F.R.D. 292 (C.D. Cal. 1992), by entering into this Order.   In addition, the \n15 inadvertent production or disclosure of Confidential Information shall be without \n16 prejudice to any claim of privilege, and the Designating Party shall not be held to \n17 have waived any rights by such inadvertent production.   \n18 J.  Subpoena for Confidential Information.   \n19 In the event that the Receiving Party receives a subpoena, discovery \n20 request, or other legal process seeking production of Confidential Information, \n21 the Receiving Party must give prompt written notice to the Designating Party.  \n22 The Receiving Party shall inform the person or entity seeking the information of \n23 the existence of this Stipulation and Order and shall not produce the Confidential \n24 Information absent a court order requiring such production.   \n25 K.  Modification.   \n26 For good cause, any Party may seek a modification of this Order, first by \n27 attempting to obtain the consent of the other parties to such modification, and \n28 then, absent consent, by application to this Court.   \n   9 \n \nRosas v Baca – Rosas Proposed Order re DRAFT protective order\n \n\n \n1 L.  Return of Confidential Information.   \n2 No more than thirty (30) calendar days after the resolution of this action, the \n3 Receiving Party and every other person and/or entity who received originals or \n4 copies of the Confidential Information shall return all originals and copies of the \n5 Confidential Information, and material derived therefrom, including, but not limited \n6 to, all log(s) of persons authorized to review the protected documents and the \n7 written statement(s) acknowledging the terms and provisions of this Order pursuant \n8 to Paragraph V – G of this Order, to the Designating Party care of:  \n9   Paul B.

CV 12-00428 DDP\n11 \nGOODWIN on behalf of themselves \nand of those similarly situated,  ORDER PRELIMINARILY \n12 \nAPPROVING PARTIES’ \nPlaintiff,  PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n13 \nvs. \n14 \nHonorable Dean D. Pregerson \nJim McDonnell, Sheriff of Los Angeles   Ctrm:  3 \n15 \nCounty, in his official capacity,   \n[LINK TO DOCKET NUMBER 110] \n16 \nDefendant. \n17 \n \n \n18 \n19  Pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule 23”), \n20  the Parties jointly move the Court to grant preliminary approval to the proposed \n21  settlement agreement (“the Settlement”), attached as Exhibits A and B to the \n22  Motion (docket number 110), and to approve the Parties’ proposed Notice to \n23  members of the Plaintiff Class (“Class Members”), attached as Exhibit C to the \n24  Motion.  Based on the entire record before the Court, the Court finds: \n25  The Settlement is the result of extensive arms-length negotiations between \n26  the Parties.  After reviewing the terms of the Settlement in light of the record and of \n27  controlling legal authority, the Court finds the Settlement is sufficiently reasonable, \n28  adequate, fair, and consistent with relevant federal law to warrant preliminary \n-1-   \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-SH   Document 111   Filed 01/23/15   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #:2459\n \n1  approval and provision of notice to Class Members of a hearing for final approval \n2  of the Settlement (“the Fairness Hearing”). \n3  The Court also finds that the form of Notice (Exhibit C) constitutes due and \n4  sufficient notice of the Settlement to all persons entitled to receive notice required \n5  by due process and Rule 23.  The Court further finds that the method of delivery of \n6  notice proposed by the Parties, namely, posting copies of the Notice in certain areas \n7  in the jails where inmates can read them, providing copies of the Notice upon \n8  request to certain inmates in disciplinary segregation, and posting copies of the \n9  Notice on the Parties’ respective websites by February 6, 2015, at least 39 days \n10  before the deadline for filing objections as provided by Rule 23(e)(2) to be the most \n11  effective and practicable manner of notice under the circumstances. \n12   \n13  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: \n14  1.  The Settlement  as Exhibits A and B is PRELIMINARILY \n15  APPROVED.  Final approval of the Settlement is subject to a hearing and to review \n16  by the Court of any objections submitted by Class Members to the terms of the \n17  Settlement. \n18  2.

This Report is based \nupon the Panel’s reviews of policies, procedures and directives proposed and/or \nimplemented by the Department, multiple tours of the jails, numerous meetings \nwith Department personnel, reviews of training courses, and the “Self-Assessment \nStatus Report December 2015” (the “Self-Assessment”) submitted by the Los \nAngeles Sheriff’s Department (the “Department”) to the Panel on January 5, 2016, \nwhich the Panel urges the Department to provide to Class Counsel, if it has not \nalready done so.   This Report also takes into consideration the comments of the \nCounty and the Plaintiffs in the Rosas case as well as  some of the activities that \nthe Sheriff and the Department have undertaken to implement provisions of the \nAction Plan after the end of the Initial Reporting Period.   \n \n  The Agreement provides that “[w]hen the Panel certifies that any \nrecommendation of the Action Plan has been implemented, it shall commence a \nperiod of monitoring the Defendant’s compliance with respect to the \nrecommendation (‘Compliance Period’).”   On December 11, 2015, the Panel \ncertified that as of November 18, 2015, the Department had “adopted policies, \ndirectives, and practices that implement” the 67 recommendations in the Action \nPlan.2  The policies and directives were reviewed and approved by the Panel, and \nthe Department provided the Panel with internal communications to verify that the \n                                                 \n1 In October 2014, the Panel submitted an Implementation Plan to the Parties and the \nCourt as required under the Agreement.  This Report uses the term “Action Plan,” which is used \nby the Parties in the Agreement to refer to the Implementation Plan. \n2 The “practices” were existing practices that were not the subject of a new policy or \ndirective.  As with the new policies and directives, the Panel will monitor the Department’s \nadherence to existing practices that satisfy provisions of the Action.  \n- 1 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 4 of 16   Page ID #:3571\npolicies and directives were communicated to Department personnel before \nNovember 18, 2015.  In addition, the Department implemented the Panel’s \nrecommendation regarding ethics training for existing personnel in the six month \nperiod prior to the Initial Reporting Period.  \n \n  We agree, as Plaintiffs suggest, that “policies required in the Action Plan are \nthe first step” and “sustained implementation of the policies and trainings will, \nhowever, serve as the true indicator of [the Department’s] progress.”  Plaintiff’s \nComments at 1.  Prior to certifying the Department’s policies that implemented \nmany of the 67 recommendations, the Panel reviewed and commented on \nnumerous drafts submitted by the Department, and took into consideration the \nlanguage of specific provisions of the Action Plan, the practicality of implementing \nother provisions, and the extent to which the proposed policies, individually and \ncollectively, adequately addressed these recommendations.   Although the \nDepartment should consider seriously any further revisions that Plaintiffs may \nsuggest to enhance the existing policies so as “to ensure that prisoners ‘are not \nsubjected to excessive force in the Jail Complex,’”  Plaintiff’s Comments at 1.  \nQuoting Action Plan at 2, the Panel believes that the policies it certified satisfy \nthose portions of the requirements of the Action Plan.    \n \n  There are an additional 35 recommendations in the Action Plan that were not \nimplemented by the Department in the Initial Reporting Period.  There are also two  \nrecommendations in the Action Plan that have been superseded by the Joint \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the United States of \nAmerica v. County of Los Angeles, et al., No. 2:15-cv-05903 (the “DOJ case”) \npending before this Court.3 \n \n  The Parties have agreed to use December 1, 2015 as the date by which the \nPanel will commence its monitoring of the Department’s compliance with the \nPanel’s recommendations that were implemented by the Department during the \nInitial Reporting Period.  The Panel is still in the process of attempting to develop \nCompliance Measures by which it will determine the Department’s compliance \nwith these recommendations for the 12-month and 18-month periods required \nunder the Agreement. \n \n  The Panel believes that  the Department has made substantial progress in \nimplementing the recommendations of the Action Plan and reforming its Custody \n                                                 \n3 §4.10 pertains to the extension of the Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution \ntraining to additional Department members in Custody Operations and §9.1 pertains to Safety \nChecks, both of which are governed by terms of the Settlement Agreement in the DOJ case. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 5 of 16   Page ID #:3572\nOperations.  We have had a constructive dialogue with, and the cooperation of, \nDepartment and County Counsel personnel responsible for the implementation of \nthe recommendations in the Action Plan, toured the jails on multiple occasions, \nand have had numerous conversations with both inmates and staff.  It is our strong \nimpression that the Department has achieved a positive change in the culture in the \njails with enhanced supervision, training, and professionalism, and we note that \nthere has been a significant reduction in uses of force resulting in serious injuries, \ngreater management accountability, and improved inmate-staff communications.  \nThe implementation of the recommendations in the Action Plan is, of course, only \nthe first phase, and the monitoring of these recommendations will present its own \nchallenges that will require the continuing cooperation of the Department.   \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 6 of 16   Page ID #:3573\nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  The four recommendations in this section (§1.1 through §1.4) of the Action \nPlan require that Custody Operations be headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no \nother areas of responsibility; the Sheriff be personally engaged in management of \nthe Department’s jail facilities; Department managers be held accountable for any \nfailures to address force problems in the jails; and the Department regularly report \nto the Board of Supervisors on use of force and its compliance with the Action \nPlan.  Custody Operations has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other \nareas of responsibility since well before December 1, 2015, and is continuing this \nstructure under the new Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations who was hired to \nreplace Assistant Sheriff Terri McDonald.   \n \n  The Department also provided policies regarding the responsibilities of the \nSheriff, the Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operation, and command staff, and \ndescribed reporting practices to implement each of these provisions, effective \nDecember 1, 2015.  These policies did not explicitly state that Unit Commanders \n“will be ‘held accountable should they fail to address use of force problems’” in \ntheir jail facilities, and the Department has agreed to revise the policies to \nincorporate the language from §1.3 of the Action Plan as requested by Plaintiff’s \nCounsel.  The Panel does not believe that it is necessary for the Department to set \nforth in advance what penalties may be imposed if commanders do not address \nforce problems in the jails, as long as the Department does, in fact, hold them \naccountable if they fail to address problems in their facilities. \n \n  The Panel has also discussed with County Counsel the County’s reporting to \nthe Board of Supervisors, and we have advised County Counsel that we expect the \nCounty to make public reports to the Board at least quarterly on the Department’s \nuse of force and the implementation of the Action Plan.   Although it is possible \nthat, in response to these public reports, the Board may raise issues about incidents \nthat are the subject of litigation and that may be discussed in closed session under \nCalifornia law, the  Department must publicly report on its compliance efforts.  \nThe Panel expects to review the County’s reports to the Board to ensure that they \naccurately reflect the Panel’s understanding of the status of the County’s \nimplementation of the Action Plan. \n \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 7 of 16   Page ID #:3574\n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  The first recommendation in this section (§2.1) requires the Department to \n“have a separate, revised, free-standing, and logically organized Custody Force \nManual for Custody Operations[.]”  On October 16, 2015, the Department \nprovided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with separate sections \non Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-\nInvolved Shootings.  This implements §2.1, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  The remaining twelve recommendations (§2.2 through §2.13) require the \nDepartment to adopt new use of force policies for Custody Operations.   As noted \nin the introduction to this report, over the course of a number of months, the \nDepartment submitted drafts of proposed use of force polices to the Panel to \nimplement these recommendations.   The Panel reviewed the drafts, required \nchanges where appropriate, and ultimately approved use of force policies for \nCustody Operations that implement these recommendations, effective December 1, \n2015.  Although, as noted by Plaintiffs, the Department’s policies do not always \nuse “the specific language” set forth in the Action Plan (e.g., §§ 2.6, 2.8 and 2.10), \nnothing in the Agreement or the Action Plan requires that the Department’s \npolicies track the exact wording in the Action Plan.  The Panel believes that the \nDepartment’s policy to implement Section 2.6 satisfies the intent of the section as \nwritten, the policy to implement Section 2.8 imposes a duty on Department \nmembers that is reasonable and practical, and the policy to implement Section 2.10 \nis reflected in several provisions.  See 7-01/020.0 (“Department members may only \nuse authorized weapons for which they have been trained to promote a safe and \neffective response to situations”); 7-08/000.00 (“deployment of special weapons \n(which have been authorized by the Department)”); 7-08/010.00 (list of authorized \nspecial weapons and chemical agents). \n \n  Beginning in the next reporting period from, the Panel will review random \ncompleted “force packages” for force incidents after December 1, 2015, obtain \nreports from the Department,4 tour the basin facilities, and interview inmates and \nstaff to assess the Department’s continuing Compliance with the specific use of \nforce recommendations during the Compliance Period.5 \n                                                 \n4 The underlying data upon which the Department’s reports are based will be subject to \naudit by the Panel.  \n5 The process for assessing the Department’s continuing Compliance with other policies \nadopted by the Department to implement other provisions of the Action Plan discussed below \nwill be similar.   \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 8 of 16   Page ID #:3575\n3.  Training and Professional Development Related to Use of Force \n \n  The first four recommendations of this section (§3.1 through §3.4) require \nthat Department members receive training in use of force policies, ethics, \nprofessionalism, and treating inmates with respect, and new Department members \nreceive additional Custody specific training in these areas in the Academy or the \nJail Continuum in Custody Operations.      \n \n  The Self-Assessment reports that the Department has waited to develop its \nuse of force training until after the Panel approved the new use of force policies, \nand it anticipates offering the course in early 2016.  The monitors have not yet \nreviewed either the curriculum or the training materials for the use of force \ntraining.   \n \n  The Panel reviewed the Department’s proposed Ethics curriculum and \ntraining materials, attended several training sessions, and approved the \nDepartment’s Ethics training in May 2015.  The Department had initiated ongoing \nin-service training prior to Panel approval of the curriculum or the training itself, \nbut the panel determined that the changes in the training ultimately approved \nshould not require those staff already trained to repeat the course.  As the \nDepartment notes, for existing personnel, Compliance will be determined for a \nparticular subject matter when a certain percentage of the existing personnel who \nare on duty as of the date  the training  is approved by the Panel have received the \nrequired training.6  Thus, compliance with §3.2, which requires such Ethics \ntraining for existing personnel, will be determined when a certain percentage (still \nto be determined by the Panel) of the existing personnel as of May 1, 2015, have \nreceived the Ethics training and have attended the refresher course as required by \nthe Action Plan until the Agreement is terminated. \n \n  The Department reports that new deputies are required to complete a six-\nweek Jail Operations and Jail Operations Continuum course that includes custody-\nspecific, scenario based use-of-force training and training in ethics, \nprofessionalism and treating inmates with respect, and that new Custody Assistants \nreceive training in these subjects during their nine-week Academy training.  The \nPanel has not reviewed the curriculum or training materials for Jail Operations and \nJail Operations Continuum in these subjects.  For new personnel, Compliance will \n                                                 \n6 This formula only applies to the initial training of existing personnel, and is subject to \nconfirming that existing personnel receive refresher training as required by the Action Plan until \nthe Agreement is terminated under Section VIII, ¶2.   \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 9 of 16   Page ID #:3576\nbe determined as a percentage of the new members  in Custody Operations who \nhave received the new training.     \n \n  §3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine what additional training, \ncounseling or mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving \nthe use of force is resolved with a finding that it “Appears Employee Conduct \nCould Have Been Better.”  The Department provided the Panel with a draft policy \nto implement this recommendation, which it anticipates will be published in the \nnext reporting period as part of the Department’s revision of its policies and \nprocedures for handling inmate requests and grievances discussed below.  The \nPanel recommends that the Department provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with drafts of \nrevised policies for handling inmate requests and grievances for Counsel’s input \nbefore finalizing and adopting these policies. \n   \n  The Department issued 3-01/020.15 to require unit commanders  to review \nnew Department members within 90 days months of being initially assigned to a \nUnit and again before the end of their probationary period, to implement §3.6.  The \nPanel certified the Department’s implementation of §3.6 as of December 1, 2015, \nas the policy technically meets the requirement of §3.6 that the initial assessment \nbe within “six months of [a probationary employee] being assigned to Custody.”  \nThe Panel, however, shares the Plaintiff’s concern, that “[n]inety days may be an \ninsufficient time in which to assess and employee’s conduct,” and the Department \nhas agreed to extend the 90-day period to six months for the initial probationary \nreview.   \n \n  Compliance with §3.6 will require that Unit Commanders conduct \nmeaningful and thorough assessments of the probationary employee’s performance \nwithin 90 days of the initial assignment and again “30 days prior to the end of the \nprobationary period.”   The Panel will randomly review initial and final \nassessments of probationary employees to assess compliance with this provision.   \n \n \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 10 of 16   Page ID\n #:3577\n4.  Use of Force on Mentally Ill Prisoners and Other Special Needs \nPopulations \n \n  The first five recommendations (§4.1 through §4.5) require the Department \nto adopt specific use of force policies for Custody Operations for dealing with \nmentally ill prisoners.   The Panel reviewed drafts of Department use of force \npolicies to implement these recommendations, required changes where appropriate, \nand ultimately approved the policies, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n  The next four recommendations (§4.6 through §4.9) require the Department \nto provide Custody-specific, scenario-based, skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and on \n“identifying and working with mentally ill inmates.”  On November 6, 2015, with \ninput from a Subject Matter Expert in the DOJ case, the Panel approved the \ncurriculum for the “De-escalation & Verbal Resolution Training (“DeVRT”) that \nthe Department developed to address these recommendations.   \n \n  The Department provided the Panel with training materials for DeVRT on \nDecember 28, 2015.  The Panel provided its comments to the Department on \nFebruary 2, 2016, and  met with the Department on March 4, 2016, to review the \ntraining materials.  Following that meeting, the Panel approved the Department’s \nDeVRT training materials.   \n \n  Although, as reported by the Department, 427 Department members have \nreceived DeVRT training as of December 31, 2015.  The Panel has advised the \nDepartment that these members may have to undergo some additional training in \nsubjects included in the approved DeVRT curriculum that were not covered in the \nDeVRT training that occurred before the Panel approved the curriculum and \ntraining materials.  At the meeting on March 4, 2016, the Department agreed that \nin 2017 these Department members will attend the first eight-hour refresher course, \nwhich will consist of the additional subjects added to the DeVRT training after \nNovember 6, 2015.  Compliance will be determined once the required percentage \nof Department members have received the required DeVRT training though the 32-\nhour course and the eight-hour refresher course.  The members who received \nDeVRT training before the Panel approved the Department’s DeVRT training \nmaterials will be included in the denominator of the formula to calculate a \ncompliance percentage, but will not be included in the numerator until they have \ncompleted the eight-hour refresher course.   \n \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 11 of 16   Page ID\n #:3578\n  The final recommendation in this section (§4.10) is moot because the \nextension of the training in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution to \nadditional personnel is required by the Settlement Agreement in the DOJ case.  \n \n5.  Data Tracking and Reporting of Force Incidents \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§5.1 through §5.3) require the \nDepartment to track use of force investigations, reviews, and evaluations; provide \nfor appropriate reviews of the evaluations of force incidents; and conduct \nadditional investigation of discrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The \nPanel reviewed drafts of Department policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved \nthe policies, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n6.  Inmate Grievances and Other Complaints of Excessive Force \n \n  The recommendations in this section (§6.1 through §6.20) require extensive \nchanges in how the Department handles inmate grievances and requests for \nservice.   As noted in the Self-Assessment, on December 1, 2015, the Department \nsubmitted to the Panel a series of new policies that substantially revised the \nDepartment’s inmate grievance system.   On December 21, 2015, the Panel met \nwith the leadership from the Custody Division Grievance Team to review the \npolicies.  The Department has submitted successive drafts of the revised policies to \nthe Panel for review and comments, and incorporated nearly all the Panel’s \nrecommendations7 as well as recommendations of the Office of Inspector General.    \nThe Panel recommends that the Department provide the latest drafts of these \npolicies to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their review and comment before finally \nadopting these policies.  With the exception of one recommendation discussed \nbelow, the Panel anticipates that the policies issued by Department in the next \nreporting period will substantially overhaul the inmate grievance system and \nimplement the recommendations in section six of the Action Plan. \n \n  The policies reviewed by the Panel for the inmate grievance system \ncontemplated by the Department do not “establish a centralized unit with sworn \npersonnel, custody assistants, and civilian personnel” that would be “co-located” in \nthe Twin Towers Correctional Facility and the Pitchess Detention Center as \nrequired by §6.16, although they do provide for some additional centralized \noversight.  Based upon the policies reviewed by the Panel and conversations with \n                                                 \n7 The Department has provided reasonable explanations in those instances in which it did \nnot adopt the Panel’s recommendations.   \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 12 of 16   Page ID\n #:3579\nDepartment personnel about these policies, the Panel recognizes that the \nDepartment has given a great deal of consideration about how best to organize the \ninmate grievance system going forward.   The Panel has advised the Department \nthat it will defer to the Department’s judgment on the organization of the system \nwith the understanding that the Panel reserves the right to re-visit the Department’s \ncompliance with §6.16 if the Panel concludes that the Department is not effectively \nand efficiently handling inmate grievances and requests for service.  \n \n7.  Inmate Supervision, Staff Inmate Relations, and Communications with \nPrisoners  \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§7.1 through §7.3) require the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting \navailable under the Department’s Conflict Resolution Policy; advise inmates of the \nresults of Department investigations of inmate grievances; and ensure adequate \navenues for constructive prisoner-staff communications.  The Panel reviewed \ndrafts of Department policies to implement these recommendations, required \nchanges where appropriate, and ultimately approved the policies, effective \nDecember 1, 2015. \n \n8.  Retaliation Against Inmates \n \n  Two of the recommendations in this section (§8.1 and §8.3) require the \nDepartment to prohibit personnel from retaliating against inmates and require the \nCustody Force Review Committee to review evaluations of investigations of \ninmate grievances that force was used to retaliate against the inmate.  The Panel \nreviewed drafts of Department policies to implement these recommendations, \nrequired changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved the policies, effective \nDecember 1, 2015.   \n \n  The remaining section (§8.2)  has not yet been implemented by the \nDepartment.  It requires the Department to combine policies pertaining to \n“Complaints of Retaliation” into one section in the Custody Division Manual, \nwhich the Department plans as part of the overhaul of the inmate grievance system \nin the next Reporting Period. \n \n9.  Security Practices \n \n  The first recommendation in this section (§9.1), which pertains to cell \nchecks, is moot because it is covered by the Settlement Agreement in the DOJ \ncase.  The remaining two recommendations (§9.2 and §9.3) require the \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 13 of 16   Page ID\n #:3580\nDepartment’s use of force policies to provide that (1) staff members involved in a \nforce incident should not escort the inmate to medical, holding or segregation after \nthe incident and (2) Department members have a duty to protect inmates and to \nintervene as soon as it is reasonably safe to do so.  Although the Panel reviewed \ndrafts of Department policies to implement these recommendations, required \nchanges where appropriate, and ultimately approved the policies, effective \nDecember 1, 2015, they do not track the language of §9.3.  As requested by \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel, the Department has advised us that it will add language \nconsistent with this section to its Force Prevention Principles. \n \n10.  Management Presence in Housing Units \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§10.1 and §10.2) require senior \nmanagers to periodically tour the jails and the Department to document visits by \nmanagers (above the rank of Sergeants) in electronic records or visitor logs.  The \nPanel reviewed drafts of Department policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved \nthe policies, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n11.  Management Review of Force Incidents & Data \n \n  The single recommendation in this section (§11.1) requires that the Custody \nForce Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing the correctness of evaluations of \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of such incidents.  The \nPanel reviewed drafts of the Department policy to implement this \nrecommendations and approved the policy, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n12.  Reviews and Investigations of Force Incidents \n \n  The first recommendation in this section (§12.1) requires that all Custody \nSergeants receive additional training in conducting force investigations and \nreviewing force reports.  The Department has not yet implemented this provision.  \nThe Department has provided the Panel with a course outline entitled Supervisor \nOrientation on Use of Force Investigations and Documentation, as well as \npowerpoint training materials.  The Panel has provided its comments to the \nDepartment on these materials, which the Department is considering.  The Panel \nanticipates that the Department will begin providing the additional training to \nCustody Sergeants in the next Reporting Period. \n \n  The next three recommendations (§12.2 through §12.4) require the \nDepartment to adopt policies and practices regarding the interviewing of inmates in \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 14 of 16   Page ID\n #:3581\nconnection with force incidents and the escorting of inmates involved in such \nincidents.  The Panel reviewed drafts of the Department policy to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved \nthe polices, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n  The final recommendation requires that use of force investigative packages \nshould have a standard order and format.  Based upon the policy adopted by the \nDepartment, the Panel determined that the Department has implemented this \nrecommendation, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n13.  Disposition of Use of Force Reviews and Staff Discipline Issues \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§13.1 and §13.2) require the \ndocumentation of reasons and reporting to the Office of Inspector General \nwhenever the Department does not terminate a member who has been found to \nhave been dishonest, used excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape \nElimination Act (“PREA”).  The Department did not implement these \nrecommendations during the First Reporting Period.  The Panel anticipates that the \nDepartment will implement these recommendations in the next Reporting Period. \n \n \n14.  Criminal Referrals and External Reviews of Use of Force Incidents \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§14.1 and §14.2) require (1) an \nadditional review of referrals of an inmate for criminal prosecution arising from an \nincident involving the use of force by a Department members and (2) timely \nreferrals to the District Attorney of “officer misconduct that may amount to \ncriminal violations.”  The Panel reviewed and approved the Department directive \nto implement §14.1, effective December 1, 2015.  The Department considers the \ntimely referrals to the District Attorney’s office to be a practice in place as of \nDecember 1, 2015, which will be subject to monitoring by the Panel  to assess the \ntimeliness of the Department’s referrals for criminal prosecution. \n \n15.  Documentation and Recording of Force Incidents \n \n  The seven recommendations in this section (§15.1 through §15.7) require the \nDepartment to have specific polices and procedures regarding the reporting of \nforce incidents by Department members, the separation of Department members \nbefore writing reports of force incidents, and the review of force reports by Watch \nCommanders/Supervising Lieutenants and Unit Commanders.  The Panel reviewed \ndrafts of Department policies to implement these recommendations, required \n- 12 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 15 of 16   Page ID\n #:3582\nchanges where appropriate, and ultimately approved the policies, effective \nDecember 1, 2015. \n \n16.  Health Care Assessments and Documentation Following Force Incidents \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§16.1 through §16.3) require the \nDepartment to have policies for medical assessments of inmates and Department \nmembers involved in force incidents.  The Panel reviewed drafts of Department \npolicies to implement these recommendations, required changes where appropriate, \nand ultimately approved the policies, effective December 1, 2015.  The \nDepartment has advised the Panel that it will revise 7-07/000 to make it clear that \nthe documented medical assessment of the inmate must be completed “as soon as \npractical” as requested by Plaintiff’s Counsel. \n \n17.  Use of Restraints \n \n   The first recommendation in this section (§17.1) requires that the Custody \nForce Manual include “a separate section that sets forth the general principles \ngoverning the  use of restraints” identified in this recommendation.”  This \nDepartment has included such a separate section in the Manual, which implements \n§17.1, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  The remaining nine recommendations (§17.2 through §17.10) require the \nDepartment to adopt specific policies for the use of restraints in Custody \nOperations.   The Panel reviewed  drafts of use of force policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved \npolicies that implement these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  With \nrespect to the comments of Plaintiff’s Counsel, 7-03/030.00 does have the \n“limiting language” in the first paragraph that is required to address the \nrequirement of §17.7 that “multi-point restraints8 may only be ordered where an \ninmate poses an immediate threat of serious harm to himself or others,” and it is \nreasonable to allow them to be used when it is “necessary to provide medical care \nas determined by medical staff.”  It also provides in the first paragraph that \n“[u]nder no circumstances should custody personnel request that “medical staff \nmedicate an inmate for security purposes” as required by §17.10.  The Panel \nbelieves that the Department’s policy, which requires the “use of medically \nordered restraint devices” to be “determined by medical or mental health staff,” is \nmore restrictive than what is set forth in §17.9, which would permit a shift \n                                                 \n8 Multi-point restraints are a category of Medically Ordered Restraint Devices under this \npolicy. \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 141   Filed 04/07/16   Page 16 of 16   Page ID\n #:3583\nsupervisor to authorize the use of a multi-point restraint if medical or mental health \nprofessionals are not available.            \n \n18.  Adequate Staffing and Staff Rotations \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§18.1 and §18.2) require the \nDepartment to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotations policies and (2) audit each \nunit’s compliance with its rotations policies.  The existing policies did not require \nrotations of personnel among different jails.  The Panel reviewed the drafts and \napproved the policy for Custody Operations that implements these two \nrecommendations, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n19.  Early Warning System Related to Use of Force \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§19.1 through §19.3) require the \nDepartment to develop a formal Early Warning System to identify potentially \nproblematic employees based upon objective criteria.   The Department reports that \nit “anticipates that substantive provisions related to the Early Warning System will \nbe ready for monitoring in late 2016.” \n \n20.  Protocols for Planned Use of Force \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§20.1 through §20.3) require the \nDepartment to have two categories of force:  Reactive Force and Planned Force.  \nThe Panel reviewed the drafts of Department policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations that implements these three \nrecommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  We note, however, that the force \npackages we have reviewed refer to force as “Directed” force and “Rescue” force \nrather than using the terms and “Reactive Force” and “Planned Force,” which are \nrequired in order for the Department to establish compliance with several of the \nPanel’s recommendations.   \n \n21.  Organizational Culture Related to Use of Force \n \n  The recommendation in this section (§21.1) requires that the Department’s \npolicies “provide that the Department will not transfer or assign a staff member to \nCustody as a formal or informal sanction for problem employees.”   The \nDepartment reports that it “anticipates that policy consistent with this \nrecommendation will be revised and published in the second quarter of 2016.”       \n \n- 14 - ",

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the \"Rosas\" case) provides that the \nCourt-appointed Monitors (the \"Panel\") will \"prepare and submit to the Parties and the Court \nperiodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan ('Reports') [developed \nby the Panel] at intervals the Panel shall determine.\"  This Report sets forth the status of, and \nassesses, the implementation of the provisions of the Action Plan (the \"Plan\") during the period \nfrom January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016 (the \"Second Reporting Period\"), and is \ncreated for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas case.   \n \n  This Report  takes into consideration letters received from the Parties in response to the \ndraft of this report submitted to the Parties in accordance with Section V of the Agreement.  By \nletter dated February 2, 2017, counsel for Plaintiffs responded to Defendant's comments on the \ndraft report, but advised the Panel that \"Plaintiffs' ability to comment meaningfully [on the draft \nreport] is hampered by Defendant's refusal to provide any of the documents\" Plaintiffs previously \nrequested.  The Panel understands that County has objected to the scope of Plaintiffs' document \nrequests.  The Panel also understands that the Parties are attempting to negotiate a resolution of \nthis issue.  The Panel encourages the Parties to reach agreement on the relevant documents and \ninformation Plaintiffs need to be able to assess the Panel's conclusions about the Department's \ncompliance with the Action Plan.  In May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel \"to prepare an \nAction Plan relating to certain policies and practices employed in the Los Angeles County Jails\" \nin downtown Los Angeles (the \"Downtown Jail Complex\")1 in areas of concern to the Parties.  \nPursuant to Paragraph III of the Agreement, the Panel developed a Plan that was submitted to the \nParties and the Court in October 2014.2  The Plan sets forth provisions that the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff is required to implement in the twenty-one areas discussed in this Report \npertaining to the use of force by members of the Sheriff's Department (the \"Department\") in the \nDowntown Jail Complex.     \n \n  The Agreement contemplated that many of the provisions of the Plan would be \nimplemented within six months after the Panel submitted the Plan to the Court and the parties,3 \nbut the Agreement did not receive Final Approval from this Court until April 21, 2015.  Further, \nas discussed in the Panel's Report submitted to the Court on April 7, 2016, for the Initial \nReporting Period from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the Agreement contemplates a \ntwo-step process of Department's \"implementation\" of the Panel's recommendations followed by \nthe Panel's monitoring the Department's \"compliance.\"  It provides that \"[w]hen the Panel \ncertifies that any recommendation of the Action Plan has been implemented, it shall commence a \nperiod of monitoring the Defendant's compliance with respect to that recommendation \n('Compliance Period').\"  Agreement, Paragraph VIII.  Thus, for example, the Department must \n                                                 \n1 The jails in the Downtown Jail Complex are Men's Central Jail (\"MCJ\"), the Twin \nTowers Correctional Facility (\"TTCF\") and the Inmate Reception Center (\"IRC\"). \n2 The Panel used the term \"Implementation Plan\" rather than \"Action Plan.\" \n3 See Paragraph VIII(1) (\"It is anticipated. . .that Defendant will implement and be judged \nto be in compliance with numerous recommendations in six months or less from the submission \nof the Action Plan to the Court\"). \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 4 of 15   Page ID #:3603\nfirst adopt new use of force policies that implement the recommendations in Section 2 of the \nPlan.  Once the Panel certifies that the Department has adopted the required policies, the Panel \nmonitors the Department's use of force in the Downtown Jail Complex to assess its compliance \nwith these policies.   \n \n  Although the Agreement contemplates the Panel will commence its monitoring new \npolicies once it certifies that they have been adopted by the Department, the Panel recognized \nthat the Department also needed to develop and commence the new training required by the \nAction Plan before the Panel could assess the Department's compliance with these policies.  For \nexample, the Department needed to commence the new training required by Sections 3 \n(\"Training and Professional Development Related to Use of Force\") and 4 (specialized training \non the \"Use of Force on Mentally Ill Prisoners and Other Special Needs Populations\") of the \nAction Plan before the Panel commenced monitoring compliance with policies encompassed in \nSection 2 (\"Use of Force Policies and Practices\"), Section 9 (\"Security Practices\"), Section 15 \n(\"Documentation and Recording of Force Incidents\"), and Section 17 (\"Use of Restraints\").  \nSimilarly, the Panel concluded that the Department needed to develop new training \"in \nconducting use of force investigations\" and \"the new protocols for conducting such \ninvestigations\" required by Section 12.1 before it commenced monitoring of the protocols that \nwere adopted to implement the rest of Section 12 (\"Reviews and Investigations of Use of Force \nIncidents\"), Section 15 (\"Documentation and Recording of Force Incidents\"), and Section 16 \n(\"Health Care Assessments\"). \n \n  The Panel also recognized that the Parties needed a set of Compliance Measures by \nwhich the Panel would measure the Department's compliance with the policies adopted to \nimplement the Action Plan.  Unlike in United States of America v. County of Los Angeles and \nLos Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, CV No. 15-05903 (the \"DOJ case\"), the Parties in \nthe Rosas case did not agree on Compliance Measures before they entered into the Settlement \nAgreement.  Thus the Panel needed to develop Compliance Measures for the 105 provisions in \nthe 21 different subject matter areas in the Plan that covered training, policies, and practices, \nwith input from the parties to ensure that the final Compliance Measures were both meaningful \nand achievable.  The complex and time-consuming process to develop and finalize the \nCompliance Measures took several months before the Panel concluded that the Compliance \nMeasures satisfied this criteria.  The Panel gave both Parties several opportunities to critique and \ncomment on the various drafts of the Compliance Measures, and incorporated many of the \nchanges requested by the Parties.  On November 17, 2016, the Panel adopted the final \nCompliance Measures that they will use to determine the Department's compliance with the \nprovisions of the Plan for the twelve- and eighteen-month periods required by the Settlement \nAgreement. \n \n  As noted in the Panel's First Report, on December 11, 2015, the Panel certified that the \nDepartment had \"adopted policies, directives, and practices that implement\" 67 of the \nrecommendations in the Action Plan, including all of the use of force related policy \nrecommendations.  Pursuant to agreement of the parties, the certification was as of December 1, \n2015.  Also during the First Reporting Period, the Panel approved the Department's Ethics \ntraining program, although it omitted the program from its December 11, 2015 certification.   \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 5 of 15   Page ID #:3604\n  On December 19, 2016, the Panel certified that the Department adopted policies, \ndirectives, and practices to implement another 33 recommendations in nine areas during the \nSecond Reporting Period from January 1, 2016.  At the same time, the Panel also certified the \nDepartment's Ethics training program.   \n \n  As of December 19, 2016, the Department has implemented 101 of the recommendations \nin the Plan.  The Panel is of the view that two of the recommendations, §4.10 (expansion of \nconflict resolution training) and §9.1 (security checks), have been superseded by the Settlement \nAgreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the DOJ case, but there is a disagreement \namong the parties about whether the Panel is required to monitor the Department's compliance \nwith §9.1, which sets forth requirements for safety checks that are encompassed by the terms of \nthe Settlement Agreement in the DOJ case.  Absent instructions to the contrary from the Court, \nthe Panel is not intending to monitor the Department's safety checks that are being monitored in \nthe DOJ case. \n \n  There are four additional recommendations that have not been implemented by the \nDepartment as of December 31, 2016, pertaining to the use of force investigations training \nrequired by §12.1, and development of a formal Early Warning System as required by §§19.1 \nthrough 19.3.  The Panel met with the Department on December 19, 2016, to discuss concerns \nabout the use of force investigations training and to receive a status report on the Early Warning \nSystem set forth in this report. \n \n  There is one significant remaining issue that the Panel believes the parties need to \nresolve.  Under the Settlement Agreement, all recommendations implemented during the same \nsix-month period are grouped together for purposes of determining compliance with the \n\"consecutive\" twelve-month period, no matter how disparate the recommendations may be.  \nUnder this \"cross-collateralization,\" a failure to comply with a recommendation in one area \nduring a twelve-month period means that the twelve-month time period starts over for all \nrecommendations that were implemented in the same six-month period.  This is the case \nregardless of the relationship between the recommendations implemented in the same period. \n \n  Plaintiffs have expressed the view that, under the Agreement, the Department must \ndemonstrate compliance with all of the 105 recommendations for twelve consecutive months \nbecause not all of the recommendations were implemented within twelve months after the Plan \nwas submitted to the parties and the Court, notwithstanding that there was no Final Approval of \nthe Settlement Agreement for six months after the Plan was submitted.  Based upon the many \nnew policies and systems the Department is implementing across 21 categories in the Action \nPlan, the additional training required, and the Compliance percentages that the Department is \nrequired to meet, the Panel is doubtful that, despite the Department's best efforts, it will be able \nto comply with all 105 recommendations for twelve consecutive months in the foreseeable \nfuture.  \n \n  As noted by Plaintiffs, in a meeting with the Parties last year the Panel expressed the \nview that \"it is appropriate to consider organizing the compliance groupings (buckets) in a \ndifferent way from that set out in the Settlement\" rather than \"grouping them based on the time \nof implementation.\"  Plaintiffs report that they have \"agreed to amend the termination provision \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 6 of 15   Page ID #:3605\nby changing to subject matter buckets,\" and that that the Parties \"are in the process of negotiating \nhow to amend the consent decree provision on compliance and termination.\"  The Panel urges \nthe parties to develop a meaningful and achievable framework for determining the Department's \ncompliance under the Settlement Agreement. \n \n  As discussed in more detail below, during the Second Reporting Period, the Panel visited \nthe jails in the Downtown Jail Complex on multiple occasions and met with inmates and staff \nduring those visits, observed training several sessions, and met with the leadership of Custody \noperations on several occasions to provide feedback on the Panel's observations.  The Panel also \nreviewed force packages pertaining to incidents involving inmates who were interviewed by the \nPanel and/or identified by Plaintiffs as having potentially problematic issues.  The Panel also \nreviewed and recommended revisions to the Department's curriculum and training materials for \nthe Conflict Resolution (known as DeVRT), and use of force training programs.  The Panel’s \nrecommendations were generally well received by the Department and both those training \nprograms were approved.  The Panel also reviewed and commented on the use of force \ninvestigations training, but did not finally approve that training during the Second Reporting \nPeriod.  The Panel also attended training sessions for DeVRT and for the new use of force \npolicies, and made a number of suggestions for enhancing the training sessions.   \n \n  The Panel also reviewed multiple drafts of policies adopted by the Department to create a \nsubstantially revamped new system for the handling of inmate grievances and requests.  The \nPanel recommended a number of revisions to the grievance system and policies, which were \ngenerally adopted by the Department.  The Panel ultimately approved the new grievance system, \nwhich was implemented by the Department on July 15, 2016.   \n \n  Finally, as noted, the Panel drafted and revised proposed Compliance Measures to set \nforth how the Panel would determine the Department's compliance the Action Plan.  On \nNovember 17, 2016, the Panel promulgated Compliance Measures for the 105 recommendations \nthat will be the subject of the Panel's monitoring activities beginning as of January 1, 2017. \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 7 of 15   Page ID #:3606\n \n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  The four recommendations in this section (§1.1 through §1.4) of the Action Plan require \nthat Custody Operations be headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, \nthe Sheriff be personally engaged in management of the Department’s jail facilities, Department \nmanagers be held accountable for any failures to address force problems in the jails, and the \nDepartment regularly report to the Board of Supervisors on use of force and its compliance with \nthe Action Plan.  Custody Operations has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other \nareas of responsibility since well before December 1, 2015, and is continuing this structure under \nKelly Harrington, the new Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations, who was hired to replace \nAssistant Sheriff Terri McDonald.   \n \n  The Department also provided policies regarding the responsibilities of the Sheriff, the \nAssistant Sheriff for Custody Operation, and command staff, and described reporting practices to \nimplement each of these provisions, effective December 1, 2015.  The Department has since \nrevised CDM 2-01/030.00 to address the requirements of §1.3 of the Action Plan to require Unit \nCommanders to be \"held accountable should they fail to address use of force problems\" in their \njail facilities. \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  The first recommendation in this section (§2.1) requires the Department to \"have a \nseparate, revised, free-standing, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody \nOperations[.]\"  On October 16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody \nOperations Force Manual with separate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with \nSpecial Populations, Restraints, Escorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special \nWeapons, and Deputy-Involved Shootings.  This implements §2.1, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  The remaining twelve recommendations (§2.2 through §2.13) require the Department to \nadopt new use of force policies for Custody Operations.  The Department submitted multiple \ndrafts of proposed use of force polices to the Panel to implement these recommendations.  The \nPanel reviewed the drafts, required changes where appropriate, and ultimately approved use of \nforce policies for Custody Operations that implement these recommendations, effective \nDecember 1, 2015.   \n \n  During the Second Reporting Period, the Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex on \nmultiple occasions, interviewed inmates identified by Plaintiffs as individuals with knowledge of \nor complaints about excessive use of force by Department personnel, and talked to many other \ninmates generally about these issues.  The Panel also reviewed force packages regarding \nincidents involving the inmates identified by Plaintiffs and did not find any instances of \nexcessive force by Department personnel in these force packages.  Although there were some \ncomplaints from the other inmates about, for example, food and responsiveness to grievances, \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 8 of 15   Page ID #:3607\nwith one exception, the Panel did not hear complaints from them about excessive use of force by \nDepartment personnel.  With respect to the one exception, the Department's records seemed to \nrefute the inmate's claim as to where and when the force incident took place.  A number of \ninmates who had been in the jails in the past volunteered that, with respect to the use of force, \n\"things were a lot better\" in the jails this time around, and that Deputy interactions with the \ninmates were more positive and respectful, and reflect a fundamental and positive change in the \nculture in the Downtown Jail Complex and the interactions between staff and the inmate \npopulations.    \n \n  Because the Compliance Measures were not issued and the use of force training was not \napproved until the fourth quarter of 2016, the Panel did not randomly select force packages for \nreview in the Second Reporting Period.  As of January 1, 2017, the Panel commenced \nmonitoring the Department's compliance with the Compliance Measures by reviewing completed \nforce packages for force incidents in 2016.   \n \n3.  Training and Professional Development Related to Use of Force \n \n  The first four recommendations of this section (§3.1 through §3.4) require that \nDepartment members receive training in use of force policies; and ethics, professionalism, and \ntreating inmates with respect; and that new Department members receive additional Custody \nspecific training in these areas in the Academy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.        \n \n  The Panel reviewed the Department’s proposed Ethics curriculum and training materials, \nattended several training sessions, and approved the Department’s Ethics training in May 2015.  \nAlthough not certified until December 2016, compliance with §3.2, which requires such ethics \ntraining for existing personnel, will be determined when 90% of the existing personnel as of May \n1, 2015, have received the ethics training and attended the refresher course as required by the \nAction Plan until the Agreement is terminated. \n \n  During the Second Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed the Department's proposed \ncurriculum and training materials for its use of force policies, and attend a training session in \nDecember 2016.  The Panel certified the Department's compliance with §3.1, which requires \nsuch training for existing personnel, as of December 16, 2016.  Compliance with §3.1 will be \ndetermined when 90% of the existing personnel as of October 1, 2016, have received the use of \nforce training and have attended the refresher course as required by the Plan until the Agreement \nis terminated. \n \n  In the First Reporting Period, the Department reported that new deputies are required to \ncomplete a six-week Jail Operations and Jail Operations Continuum course that includes \ncustody-specific, scenario-based use-of-force training and training in ethics, professionalism and \ntreating inmates with respect, and that new Custody Assistants receive training in these subjects \nduring their nine-week Academy training.  For the ethics and use of force training of new \npersonnel, compliance will require that 95% of the new members assigned to Custody \nOperations after July 1, 2015 receive the training.     \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 9 of 15   Page ID #:3608\n  §3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine what additional training, counseling or \nmentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it \"Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better.\"  The Department \nadopted a policy in CDM 8-01/020.00 as part of its new grievance system to implement this \nrecommendation, which was approved by the Panel and certified as of December 19, 2016.    \n \n  To implement §3.6, the Department issued 3-01/020.15 to require unit commanders  to \nreview new Department members within 90 days of being initially assigned to a Unit and again \nbefore the end of their probationary period.  The Panel certified the Department’s \nimplementation of §3.6 as of December 1, 2015, as the policy technically meets the requirement \nof §3.6 that the initial assessment be within \"six months of [a probationary employee] being \nassigned to Custody.\"  In the Panel's First Report, the Panel noted a concern expressed by \nPlaintiffs that \"[n]inety days may be an insufficient time in which to assess and an employee’s \nconduct.\"  As a result, the Department agreed to extend the 90-day period to six months for  \ninitial probationary review; it adopted a new Department-wide policy on September 22, 2016 in \nthe Manual of Policy and Procedures, but had not yet finalized a revised 3-01/020.15 for the \nCustody Operations as of the end of the Second Reporting Period.  Compliance with §3.6 will \nrequire that Unit Commanders conduct meaningful and thorough assessments of the probationary \nemployees performance within six months of the initial assignment and again \"30 days prior to \nthe end of the probationary period.\"  The Panel will randomly review initial and final \nassessments of probationary employees to assess compliance with this provision.   \n \n4.  Use of Force on Mentally Ill Prisoners and Other Special Needs Populations \n \n  The first five recommendations (§4.1 through §4.5) require the Department to adopt \nspecific use of force policies for Custody Operations for dealing with mentally ill prisoners.  The \nPanel reviewed drafts of Department use of force policies to implement these recommendations, \nrequired changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had implemented these \nrecommendations, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n  The next four recommendations (§4.6 through §4.9) require the Department to provide \nCustody-specific, scenario-based, skill development training for existing and new personnel in \nCrisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and on \"identifying and working with mentally ill \ninmates.\"  On March 4, 2016, the Panel approved the Department's \"De-escalation & Verbal \nResolution Training\" (\"DeVRT\") materials to implement these recommendations.  Many \nDepartment members have commented that they found the DeVRT training to be very valuable \nand have used what they learned in the training to avoid having to use force in potentially \nproblematic situations. \n \n  At a meeting on March 4, 2016, it was agreed that Department members who received \nthe DeVRT training before it was finally approved will attend the first eight-hour refresher \ncourse that is required every other year, and that the refresher course will include the additional \nsubjects added to the DeVRT training after November 6, 2015.  Compliance will be determined \nonce 90% of Department members in Custody as of July 1, 2015 have received the required \nDeVRT training.  The members who received DeVRT training before the Panel approved the \nDepartment’s DeVRT training materials will be included in the denominator of the formula to \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 10 of 15   Page ID\n #:3609\ncalculate a compliance percentage, but will not be included in the numerator until they have \ncompleted the eight-hour refresher course.  In addition 95% of new members sworn in after July \n1, 2015, must take the course and, if they took the course before the final materials were \napproved, they must attend the first eight-hour refresher course.   \n \n  The final recommendation in this section (§4.10) is moot because the extension of the \ntraining in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution to additional personnel is required by the \nSettlement Agreement in the DOJ case.  \n \n5.  Data Tracking and Reporting of Force Incidents \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§5.1 through §5.3) require the Department to \ntrack use of force investigations, reviews, and evaluations; provide for appropriate reviews of the \nevaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of discrepancies and \nunexplained tactical decisions.  The Panel certified that the Department had adopted policies to \nimplement these recommendations effective December 1, 2015.  Monitoring will begin as of \nJanuary 1, 2017.   \n \n6.  Inmate Grievances and Other Complaints of Excessive Force \n \n  The recommendations in this section (§6.1 through §6.20) require extensive changes in \nhow the Department handles inmate grievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016 the \nDepartment issued a new \"Inmate Grievance Manual,\" which is Volume 8 of the Custody \nDivision Manual, to implement a new grievance system.  It was approved by the Panel after \nextensive discussions with the Department and reviews of multiple drafts of the policies \nultimately adopted by the Department.  On December 19, 2016, the Panel certified that the \nDepartment had adopted policies and practices to implement the recommendations in this \nsection.  Monitoring of the grievance system will commence as of January 1, 2017, now that the \nDepartment has had nearly six months to implement the new system.   \n \n  One issue that remains to be resolved is whether grievances about the timeliness of \nmedical care are subject to monitoring by the Panel.  There is no disagreement that grievances \nabout the timeliness of the Department's delivery of requests for medical care are subject to \nmonitoring, and the Panel does not believe that it is qualified to assess grievances about the \nquality of medical care.  Absent agreement of the parties, the Panel intends to monitor all \ngrievances about the timeliness of medical care. \n \n  The policies adopted by the Department for the new inmate grievance system do not \n\"establish a centralized unit with sworn personnel, custody assistants, and civilian personnel\" \nthat would be \"co-located\" in the Twin Towers Correctional Facility and the Pitchess Detention \nCenter as required by §6.16, although they do provide for some additional centralized oversight.  \nAs the Panel stated in its initial Report to the Court, it is willing to defer to the Department’s \njudgment on the organization of the grievance system with the understanding that the Panel \nreserves the right to re-visit the Department’s compliance with §6.16 if the Department is not \neffectively and efficiently handling inmate grievances and requests for service.  \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 11 of 15   Page ID\n #:3610\n \n \n7.  Inmate Supervision, Staff Inmate Relations, and Communications with Prisoners  \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§7.1 through §7.3) require the Department to \nadvise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the Department’s \nConflict Resolution Policy; advise inmates of the results of Department investigations of inmate \ngrievances; and ensure adequate avenues for constructive prisoner-staff communications.  The \nPanel certified that the Department adopted policies and practices to implement these \nrecommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  Because these policies are, in effect, part of the \ngrievance system, the Panel delayed monitoring until the Panel commences monitoring the new \ngrievance system. \n \n8.  Retaliation Against Inmates \n \n  Two of the recommendations in this section (§8.1 and §8.3) require the Department to \nprohibit personnel from retaliating against inmates and require the Custody Force Review \nCommittee to review evaluations of investigations of inmate grievances that force was used to \nretaliate against the inmate.  The Panel certified that the Department adopted policies to \nimplement these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  The remaining section (§8.2) requires the Department to combine polices pertaining to \n\"Complaints of Retaliation\" into one section in the Custody Division Manual.  On July 15, 2016, \nthe Department adopted a revised policy in CDM §8-03/050 (Grievance of Retaliation) as part of \nthe inmate new grievance system.  On December 19, 2016, the Panel certified that the \nDepartment had implemented this recommendation. \n \n9.  Security Practices \n \n  The Panel is of the view that the first recommendation in this section (§9.1), which \npertains to cell checks, is moot because it is covered by the Settlement Agreement in the DOJ \ncase, and is being monitored in that case.  The Panel notes that Plaintiffs object to the Panel's \nposition and believe that \"the monitors should still monitor compliance with that provision, as \namended through the US DOJ agreement.\"  Absent a directive from the Court, the Panel is not \nintending to monitor compliance with §9.1.  \n \n  The remaining two recommendations (§9.2 and §9.3) require the Department’s use of \nforce policies to provide that (1) staff members involved in a force incident should not escort the \ninmate to medical, holding or segregation after the incident and (2) Department members have a \nduty to protect inmates and to intervene as soon as it is reasonably safe to do so.  The Panel \nreviewed drafts of Department policies to implement these recommendations, required changes \nwhere appropriate, and ultimately approved the policies, effective December 1, 2015.  The \nDepartment has now added language consistent with §9.3 to CDM §7-01.010 (Force Prevention \nPrinciples) to track the language of §9.3. \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 12 of 15   Page ID\n #:3611\n \n \n10.  Management Presence in Housing Units \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§10.1 and §10.2) require senior managers to \nperiodically tour the jails and the Department to document visits by managers (above the rank of \nSergeants) in electronic records or visitor logs.  The Panel certified that the Department adopted \npolicies to implement these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  Monitoring will \ncommence as of January 1, 2017. \n \n11.  Management Review of Force Incidents & Data \n \n  The single recommendation in this section (§11.1) requires that the Custody Force \nRollout Team’s involvement in reviewing the correctness of evaluations of force incidents not \ndelay the Department’s investigation of such incidents.  The Panel certified that the Department \nadopted policies to implement this recommendation, effective December 1, 2015.  Monitoring \nwill commence as of January 1, 2017. \n \n12.  Reviews and Investigations of Force Incidents \n \n  The first recommendation in this section (§12.1) requires that all Custody Sergeants \nreceive additional training in conducting force investigations and reviewing force reports.  The \nPanel has reviewed the Department curriculum, training materials, and training to implement this \nrecommendation, and met with the Department on December 15, 2016, to discuss some lingering \nconcerns.  The Panel has been working with the Department to enhance the training, and the \nDepartment reports that is has incorporated the Panel's recent suggestions in the training.  The \nPanel is scheduled to attend an investigative training session for sergeants later this month.  Once \nthe training is approved, compliance will be determined as set forth in the Compliance Measures \nwhen 90% of the Sergeants assigned to Custody Operations as of October 1, 2016, have received \nthe training.  In addition, 95% of the Sergeants promoted after that date must receive the training. \n \n  The next three recommendations (§12.2 through §12.4) require the Department to adopt \npolicies and practices regarding the interviewing of inmates in connection with force incidents \nand the escorting of inmates involved in such incidents.  The Panel certified that the Department \nadopted policies to implement these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  Although \nthe Panel has not approved the force investigations training course, the Panel believes that \nmonitoring of these recommendations should commence as of January 1, 2017. \n \n  The final recommendation requires that use of force investigative packages should have a \nstandard order and format.  The Panel certified that the Department adopted a policy to \nimplement this recommendation, effective December 1, 2015.  All of the force packages \nreviewed by the Panel during the Second Reporting Period, including the force packages \nreviewed by the Monitor in the DOJ case during this period, have had a consistent order and \nformat. \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 13 of 15   Page ID\n #:3612\n \n \n13.  Disposition of Use of Force Reviews and Staff Discipline Issues \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§13.1 and §13.2) require the documentation of \nreasons and reporting to the Office of Inspector General whenever the Department does not \nterminate a member who has been found to have been dishonest, used excessive force, or \nviolated the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”).  During the Second Reporting Period, the \nDepartment adopted CDM §4-10/005.00 to implement these recommendations.  The Panel \ncertified the Department's implementation of these recommendations as of December 16, 2016.  \nMonitoring of these recommendations will commence as of January 1, 2017. \n \n14.  Criminal Referrals and External Reviews of Use of Force Incidents \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§14.1 and §14.2) require (1) an additional \nreview of referrals of an inmate for criminal prosecution arising from an incident involving the \nuse of force by a Department member and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of \"officer \nmisconduct that may amount to criminal violations.\"  The Panel certified that the Department \ndirective 15-006 implemented §14.1, effective December 1, 2015.  The Department considers the \ntimely referrals to the District Attorney’s office to be a practice in place as of December 1, 2015.  \nMonitoring of these recommendations will commence as of January 1, 2017.  \n \n15.  Documentation and Recording of Force Incidents \n \n  The seven recommendations in this section (§15.1 through §15.7) require the Department \nto have specific policies and procedures regarding the reporting of force incidents by Department \nmembers, the separation of Department members before writing reports of force incidents, and \nthe review of force reports by Watch Commanders/Supervising Lieutenants and Unit \nCommanders.  The Panel certified that the Department adopted policies to implement these \nrecommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  Monitoring of these recommendations will \ncommence as of January 1, 2017. \n \n16.  Health Care Assessments and Documentation Following Force Incidents \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§16.1 through §16.3) require the Department \nto have policies for medical assessments of inmates and Department members involved in force \nincidents.  The Panel certified that the Department adopted policies to implement these \nrecommendations, effective December 1, 2015.  The Department has now  revised CDM 7-\n07/000.00, as requested by Plaintiffs' counsel, to make it clear that the documented medical \nassessment of the inmate must be completed \"as soon as practical.\"   \n \n17.  Use of Restraints \n \n  The first recommendation in this section (§17.1) requires that the Custody Force Manual \ninclude \"a separate section that sets forth the general principles governing the use of restraints\" \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 14 of 15   Page ID\n #:3613\nidentified in this recommendation.  This Department included such a separate section in the \nManual, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n  The remaining nine recommendations (§17.2 through §17.10) require the Department to \nadopt specific policies for the use of restraints in Custody Operations.  The Panel certified that \nthe Department adopted policies that implement these recommendations, effective December 1, \n2015.  Monitoring of these recommendations will commence as of January 1, 2017.         \n \n18.  Adequate Staffing and Staff Rotations \n \n  The two recommendations in this section (§18.1 and §18.2) require the Department to (1) \nmaintain Custody-wide rotations policies and (2) audit each unit’s compliance with its rotations \npolicies.  The Panel certified that the Department adopted a policy for Custody Operations that \nimplements these two recommendations effective December 1, 2015.  Monitoring of these \nrecommendations will commence as of January 1, 2017.  \n \n19.  Early Warning System Related to Use of Force \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§19.1 through §19.3) require the Department \nto develop a formal Early Warning System to identify potentially problematic employees based \nupon objective criteria.  The Panel met with the Department on December 15, 2016, to discuss \nthe status of the  Early Warning System.  In order to develop a usable system in the next \nreporting period, the Department is rebuilding the current Personal Performance Index (\"PPI\") \nbased system on a new WEB-based platform that will be able to generate reports on a unit basis \nand identify potentially problematic employees.  The Department reports that \"the new platform \nhas been completed and is in the testing stages.\"  Although it will not automatically generate \n\"alerts,\" the Panel believes that it can function as an effective Early Warning System as long as \nthe Department requires Compliance Lieutenants to generate, and Unit Commanders to review, \ntailored reports at least monthly.  Monitoring of the Early Warning System will require the \nDepartment to provide evidence that the reports are generated and reviewed timely.   \n \n20.  Protocols for Planned Use of Force \n \n  The three recommendations in this section (§20.1 through §20.3) require the Department \nto have two categories of force:  Reactive Force and Planned Force.  The Panel certified that the \nDepartment adopted policies to implement these recommendations effective December 1, 2015.  \nThe Panel noted, however, that the force packages we reviewed during the Second Reporting \nPeriod continue to refer to force as \"Directed Force\" and \"Rescue Force\" rather than just using \nthe terms \"Reactive Force\" and \"Planned Force.\"  The Department has explained that these terms \nare used for statistical purposes and are not referenced in the Department's use of force policies.   \n \n  The Panel believes the comingling of these terms will confuse staff because the Action \nPlan requires \"planned\" and \"reactive\" force, which are used in the Department's policies.  The \nPanel has recommended that the Department remove all references to force other than reactive or \nplanned from procedures, curriculum, use of force forms, and supervisor review documents.  The \nDepartment, however, remains of the view that it is appropriate to \"to continue to use 'directed' \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 148   Filed 03/01/17   Page 15 of 15   Page ID\n #:3614\nand 'rescue' force to collect data and to further categorize, where relevant, the primary categories \nof Planned and Reactive Force\" and that they \"are important indicators to those who evaluate \nforce statistics.\"   \n \n21.  Organizational Culture Related to Use of Force \n \n  This section (§21.1) requires that the Department’s policies \"provide that the Department \nwill not transfer or assign a staff member to Custody as a sanction for problem employees.\"  On \nSeptember 22, 2016, the Department adopted CDM §3-02/020.50, which the Panel certified \neffective December 16, 2016.  Monitoring will commence on January 1, 2017. \n \n \n \n \n13 \n ",

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the \"Rosas\" case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the \"Panel\") will \"prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n('Reports') [developed by the Panel] at intervals the Panel shall determine.\"  This Report sets \nforth the Panel's assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017 (the \n\"Third Reporting Period\"), and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas case.  \nIt takes into consideration comments received from the Parties regarding the draft sent to them \non March 2, 2018, in accordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement.    \nIn May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel \"to prepare an Action Plan relating to certain \npolicies and practices employed in the Los Angeles County Jails\" in downtown Los Angeles (the \n\"Downtown Jail Complex\")1 in areas of concern to the Parties.  Pursuant to Paragraph III of the \nAgreement, the Panel developed an Implementation Plan that was submitted to the Parties and \nthe Court in October 2014.2  The Plan sets forth provisions that the Los Angeles County Sheriff \nis required to implement in twenty-one areas by members of the Sheriff's Department (the \n\"Department\") in the Downtown Jail Complex.  The Plan was approved by the Court on April 7, \n2016.     \nThe Settlement Agreement contemplates a two-step process involving the Department's \n\"implementation\" of the Panel's recommendations followed by the Panel's monitoring of the \nDepartment's \"compliance\" with the recommendations.  It provides that \"[w]hen the Panel \ncertifies that any recommendation of the Action Plan has been implemented, it shall commence a \nperiod of monitoring the Defendant's compliance with respect to that recommendation \n('Compliance Period').\"  Agreement, Paragraph VIII.     \nThe Department has implemented 102 of the Panel's recommendations through \nDecember 31, 2017.3  Two of the recommendations, Section 4.10 (expansion of conflict \nresolution training) and Section 9.1 (security checks), have been superseded by the Settlement \nAgreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the case filed by the United States Department \nof Justice.  There are three additional recommendations pertaining to the development of the \nEarly Warning System required by Sections 19.1 through 19.3 that have not been implemented \nby the Department as of December 31, 2017.     \n1 The jails in the Downtown Jail Complex are Men's Central Jail (\"MCJ\"), the Twin \nTowers Correctional Facility (\"TTCF\") and the Inmate Reception Center (\"IRC\"). \n2 In developing the plan, the Panel used the term \"Implementation Plan\" rather than \n\"Action Plan.\"  This report uses the terms \"Action Plan\" or \"Plan\" to refer to the Panel's plan. \n3 The Panel has certified the Department's implementation of 101 of the Panel's \nrecommendations.  Although not formally certified,  the Panel approved the Department's \nimplementation of Paragraph 12.1, which requires that Custody sergeants receive 16 hours of \ntraining in conducting force investigations, after attending training sessions in February 2017. \n1 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 4 of 15   Page ID #:4103\n \n  Although the Agreement contemplates that the Panel will commence its monitoring of the \nDepartment's new policies once it has certified that the policies have been adopted by the \nDepartment, the Panel recognized that the Department needed to develop and commence new \ntraining before the Panel could assess the Department's compliance with the new policies.  \nDuring the Third Reporting Period, the Panel attended several training sessions and approved the \nDepartment's force investigations training, and reviewed and approved the Department's \ncurriculum and training materials for the refresher training courses in ethics, conflict resolution \n(known as DeVRT), and use of force required by the Plan.4   \n \n  The Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex on March 21, 2017 through March 23, \n2017, June 21, 2017 through June 22, 2017, August 31, 2017, and November 9, 2017.  The Panel \nspoke informally with inmates while touring the jails and also conducted formal interviews with \ninmates that were not in the presence of Department personnel.  The Panel debriefed the Custody \nleadership on the Panel's observations of conditions in the jails, and the issues raised by inmates \nduring the interviews.  The Panel also reviewed force packages and grievances pertaining to \nincidents involving the inmates who were interviewed by the Panel to determine if any of the \nincidents involved problematic force or misconduct by Department personnel.    \n \n  On June 21, 2017 the Panel met with Sheriff Jim McDonnell to discuss his oversight of \nthe Department's jail operations; the Department's implementation of, and compliance with, the \nAction Plan recommendations; and the Panel's observations concerning conditions in the \nDowntown Jail Complex and the nature and extent of the force used by Department personnel \nagainst inmates in the jails.  The Panel also had multiple meeting with the Department's Inmate \nGrievance Coordinator and met with the Inmate Grievance Teams at Men's Central Jail (\"MCJ\") \nand the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (\"TTCF\") to review the Department's implementation \nof its new grievance polices.  As discussed below, the Panel noted progress in the Department's \ntracking and handling of inmate grievances. \n \n  During the Third Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 75 completed force packages that \nwere selected by the Panel from a comprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the \nDepartment.  The packages were selected without input from the Department.  The Panel \nsubsequently met with Custody Commanders to review the force that was used in incidents that \nwere of concern to the Panel.  The reporting of the force, the supervisors' investigations, and the \ncommanders' reviews were also discussed with the Commanders.  Although there were issues \nwith the Department's tactics in some cases that may have contributed to the use of force that \ncould have been avoided, the Panel found only one incident where the force may have been \nexcessive.   \n \n  One of the problems encountered by the Panel in reviewing the force packages was the \ndelay between the dates of the force incidents and the completion of the force packages, which \nwas often over nine months.  This meant that the Panel was reviewing uses of force by \nDepartment members who had not received the new DeVRT and use of force training and force \ninvestigations were conducted by sergeants who had not received the new investigations training, \nwhich limited the usefulness of the feedback the Panel could provide to the Department.  In order \n                                                 \n4 The use of force refresher training was approved in January 2018. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 5 of 15   Page ID #:4104\n \nto reduce the delay, the Department decided to focus its investigative resources on force \nincidents occurring after January 1, 2017.  In addition, it decided that incidents captured on \nvideotape that involve minimal force,5 no injuries to inmates, and no evidence of misconduct \nwould be subject to more limited investigations and expedited reviews.  The Department \ndedicated considerable efforts to developing the plan for the investigation of these \"Non-\nCategorical Incidents,\" which the Department adopted after it was reviewed and approved by the \nPanel.6  The focus on the 2017 incidents and expedited handling of the Non-Categorical \nIncidents has resulted in shortening the lag time and allowing the Panel to review the force \nsooner, often within six months of the incident.  \n    \n  In the course of reviewing force packages and monitoring the Department's compliance \nwith the provisions in the Action Plan, it became apparent to the Panel that the existing 108-page \nMonitoring Plan was unwieldly and unworkable to assess the Department's Compliance with the \n100+ provisions of the Action Plan.  For example, some provisions relating to the use, reporting \nor investigation of force were subject to the Panel's direct reviews of force packages selected by \nthe Panel, and other provisions were subject to the Panel's audits of reviews by the Department \nof other randomly selected force packages.  Since the Compliance Measures are not part of the \nSettlement Agreement or the Action Plan, after several meetings and discussions with the \nParties, the Panel decided to revise the Compliance Measures for the purpose of assessing the \nDepartment's compliance with the Action Plan.   \n \n  The Panel proposed revised Compliance Measures to the Parties on December 19, 2017.  \nAlthough there are 21 areas in the Action Plan, the revised Compliance Measures are organized \naround conceptually related topics.  Under the revised Compliance Measures, the Panel will \nqualitatively assess the use, reporting and investigation of force by Department members based \nupon the applicable provisions in the Action Plan (the \"vertical\" approach) and then determine \ncompliance with the Plan based upon quantitative thresholds.  The Panel will also assess the \nDepartment's compliance with specific provisions of the Plan across all of the force incidents \n(the \"horizontal\" approach).  The Panel believes that this \"hybrid\" approach will facilitate the \nPanel's monitoring and reporting of the  Department's compliance with each of the provisions of \nthe Action Plan. \n \n  The Panel received comments about the revised Compliance Measures from the County \nby letter dated December 26, 2017, and from Plaintiffs' counsel by letter dated January 18, 2018.  \nPursuant to the Panel's request, to facilitate the Panel's review of force packages under the \nrevised Compliance Measures and ensure that the investigating sergeants address all applicable \nprovisions of the Action Plan, the Department developed a \"Use of Force Packet Review\" \nchecklist that tracks the Plan.  The checklist is currently used by the Department to review the \nforce packages that are sent to the Panel, and it is intended to be used by sergeants who conduct \nforce investigations in 2018.      \n \n                                                 \n5 For example, when a Deputy uses a firm grip to guide a passively resisting inmate back \ninto a cell.  \n6 The Panel understands that the plan was also reviewed and approved by the Office of \nInspector General. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 6 of 15   Page ID #:4105\n \n  As of the date of the filing of this Report, the Panel has not issued the revised \nCompliance Measures pending the resolution of an on-going dispute between the Parties over \nPlaintiffs' access to the Department's records.  In early 2017, Plaintiffs' Counsel advised the \nPanel that their \"ability to comment meaningfully [on the draft the Panel's Second Report] is \nhampered by Defendant's refusal to provide any of the documents\" Plaintiffs previously \nrequested.  During discussions regarding the Panel's proposal to revise the Compliance \nMeasures, Plaintiffs' Counsel reiterated their concerns that they would be unable to assess the \nPanel's conclusions regarding the Department's compliance with the revised measures without \noff-site access to the information reviewed and relied upon by the Panel.  Without intending to \ncomment on the merits of the Parties' positions, the Panel is planning to wait until the \noutstanding discovery disputes are resolved before issuing the revised Compliance Measures.     \n \n  There is one other significant remaining issue from last year that the Panel believes the \nParties still need to resolve.  Under the Settlement Agreement, all recommendations \nimplemented during the same six-month period are grouped together for purposes of determining \ncompliance with the \"consecutive\" twelve-month period, no matter how disparate the \nrecommendations may be.  Under this \"cross-collateralization,\" a failure to comply with a \nrecommendation in one area during a twelve-month period means that the twelve-month time \nperiod starts over for all recommendations that were implemented in the same six-month period.  \nThis is the case regardless of the relationship between the recommendations implemented in the \nsame period.  The Panel remains of the view that it is appropriate to organize the compliance \nbuckets by grouping related provisions rather than by grouping unrelated provisions based on \nwhen they were implemented.  The Panel urges the Parties to adopt a meaningful and achievable \nframework for determining the Department's compliance under the Settlement Agreement. \n \n  Although the Panel has not formally assessed the Department's compliance with each of \nthe provisions of the Action Plan in the Third Reporting Period, the Panel was actively involved \nin monitoring the Department's efforts to address the provisions of the Action Plan through \nreviewing force packages, touring the Downtown Jail Complex, interviewing inmates, reviewing \nthe new grievance system, and meetings with the Department's Command staff.  This Report sets \nforth the Panel's conclusions regarding the status of the Department's compliance with the \nprovisions of the Action Plan in the seven areas discussed below.  It is anticipated that the Panel \nwill begin to formally and quantitatively monitor the Department's compliance with the \nprovisions of the Action Plan in the next reporting period.   \n \n  As has been the case since the beginning of the Initial Reporting Period, the \nCounty cooperated completely with the Panel during the Third Reporting Period.  The \nDepartment and County Counsel facilitated our visits and inmate interviews, answered our \nquestions, responded to our requests for documents and information, provided status reports \nregarding the implementation of the grievance policies and the Early Warning System, and \nengaged in constructive conversations with us about our findings regarding the use of force \nincidents we reviewed.  We appreciate their responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, and \ncourtesy in handling our monitoring requests.  Plaintiffs' counsel also has been fully cooperative \nwith the Panel by identifying inmates for the Panel to interview and discussing the issues relating \nto the Panel's monitoring of the Department's compliance with the Action Plan.     \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 7 of 15   Page ID #:4106\n \n \n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  The four recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that \nCustody Operations be headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the \nSheriff be engaged personally in the management of the jails, the Department's managers be held \naccountable for any failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly \nreport to the Board of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and its compliance with the \nAction Plan.   \n \n  The Department has provided policies regarding the responsibilities of the Sheriff, the \nAssistant Sheriff for Custody Operation, and the command staff, and it has described reporting \npractices to implement each of these provisions, effective December 1, 2015.  Custody \nOperations has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility since \nwell before December 1, 2015.  It is currently under the direction of Kelly Harrington, the \nAssistant Sheriff for Custody Operations.   \n \n  In June 2017, the Panel met with Sheriff Jim McDonnell and reviewed his oversight of \nthe jail facilities and the Panel's findings and observations.  The Department has provided the \nPanel with a log of the Sheriff's meetings with Assistant Sheriff Harrington over the period \nJanuary 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, to review use of force data and trends, training of \nDepartment personnel, the Panel's observations, the Board of Supervisors' inquiries, the \nDepartment's tracking and monitoring systems, and inmate deaths.  \n \n  The Department has implemented revised CDM 2-01/030.00 to address the requirements \nof §1.3 of the Action Plan that require Unit Commanders to be \"held accountable should they fail \nto address use of force problems\" in their jail facilities.  Consistent with the use of force statistics \nthe Department has provided to the Panel, the Department reports that \"none of the facilities had \na substantial increase of 25% in overall force incidents, nor did any facility have a substantial \nincrease in Category 3 force incidents\" in the fourth quarter of 2017.   \n \n  The Department reports that the Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations reported on the \nDepartment's use of force in the jails to the Board of Supervisors on August 15, 2017, and \nanticipates the next report to the Board \"will occur in the upcoming months.\"   \n \n  There are a number of other provisions in the Action Plan that relate to the \nresponsibilities of management in Custody Operations.  Sections 10.1 and 10.2 require senior \nmanagers to periodically tour the jails and the Department to document visits by managers \n(above the rank of Sergeants) in electronic records or visitor logs.  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require \nthe Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotations policies and (2) audit each unit’s \ncompliance with its rotations policies.  Section 21.1 requires that the Department’s policies \n\"provide that the Department will not transfer or assign a staff member to Custody as a sanction \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 8 of 15   Page ID #:4107\n \nfor problem employees.\"  The Panel has certified that the Department adopted policies to \nimplement these additional management recommendations.  \n \n  The Department reports that in the fourth quarter of 2017, \"Senior Manager's completed \n75 tours [of the Downtown Jail Complex]\" and \"the Department did not transfer any Department \nmembers to Custody as a sanction for misconduct or a policy violation,\" but the Panel has not \nindependently verified the Department's reported results.  \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 in the Action Plan requires the Department to \"have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]\"  On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.   \n \n  The recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department use of force in \nCustody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Section 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new use \nof force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate's medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Sections 20.1 through 20.3 require the Department to define Reactive Force and Planned \nForce and adopt use of force policies for Planned Force (such as cell extractions). \n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department's policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015. \n \n    During the Third Reporting Period, the Panel undertook a number of efforts to monitor \nthe Department's use of force in the Downtown Jail Complex.  The Panel visited the jails on \nmultiple occasions, and interviewed inmates identified by Plaintiffs as having knowledge of, or \ncomplaints about, excessive use of force by Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants.  The Panel \nreviewed force packages regarding specific incidents identified by these inmates, which included \nreviewing video footage of these incidents, but the Panel did not find any instances of excessive \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 9 of 15   Page ID #:4108\n \nforce by Department personnel in these incidents.  The Panel also talked informally with many \nother inmates about, among other things, the use of force in the jails by Department personnel.  \nAs in the past, the Panel did not hear complaints in these informal discussions about excessive \nuse of force by Department personnel.  These inmates acknowledged that Department personnel \ndid not use force to retaliate against or punish inmates, although some inmates complained that \nDepartment personnel used other means (such as discipline) to retaliate against inmates.  Some \nof the inmates interviewed thought that instances of retaliation that did not involve force were \nbecoming more prevalent because the widespread presence of cameras largely precluded \nDepartment personnel from using force to retaliate against inmates.  The Panel is concerned that \nthese comments may reflect a change in the culture in the Downtown Jail Complex and in the \nattitude of Department personnel towards the inmate populations.    \n \n  In the Third Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 75 completed force packages of \nincidents that occurred in 2016 and the first six months of 2017.  There was one case about \nwhich the Panel expressed concerns to Department Commanders that the force used by \nDepartment personnel may have been excessive.  As this was the only one of the cases reviewed \nby the Panel in which the force incident was not captured on one of the closed circuit television \ncameras,7 it is not possible to conclude definitely whether the force was reasonable.  In some \nother cases, the Panel found that the Department's use of force was reasonable, but may not have \nbeen necessary if the Department personnel had used communication skills from the DeVRT \ntraining, had maintained greater distance from the inmate, or waited the arrival of other \npersonnel.  With the one possible exception, the problematic force incidents reviewed by the \nPanel involved tactical issues rather than excessive or unreasonable force.  In the other force \npackages, the force complied with the provisions applicable to the force that was used and the \nPanel concluded that the force was reasonable.  Some of the force packages were, however, not \nin compliance with the provision related to checking medical records before using chemical \nsprays and Tasers, and the force packages did not always report on the training of members on \nthe weapons used as required by the Action Plan. \n \n  Among the positive aspects noted by the Panel were that (1) the number of Department \nmembers involved in force incidents was limited to those necessary to control the inmates and \n(2) the sergeants on scene did a good job controlling the number of personnel involved and the \nextent of the force used.  To put the Panel’s findings on Use of Force practices during the Third \nReporting Period into perspective, the situation in the Downtown Jails is significantly improved \nin comparison to the years reviewed by the Citizen Commission on Jail Violence.  There are no \nallegations of multiple Deputies involved in beating inmates or using force to retaliate against \ninmates, serious Category 3 uses of force are almost non-existent, and inmates continue to \ncomment on the changes in use of force in the Jails from the “old days.”  The Panel has observed \nmanagement working consistently and aggressively to achieve these important reforms.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7 A second force incident involving the same inmate after he had been transported to the \nmedical clinic was captured on the closed circuit cameras.  The second use of force was \nreasonable and consistent with the Department's use of force policies. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 10 of 15   Page ID\n #:4109\n \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining in use of force policies and in ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with respect; \nand that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based, skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and on \"identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.\"  Section 12.1 requires that all Custody sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.       \n \n  The Panel reviewed the Department’s proposed ethics curriculum and training materials, \nattended several training sessions, and approved the Department’s ethics training required by \nSection 3.2 in May 2015.  On March 4, 2016, the Panel approved the Department's \"De-\nescalation & Verbal Resolution Training\" (\"DeVRT\") materials to implement the \nrecommendations in Sections 4.6 through 4.9.8  The Panel reviewed the Department's proposed \ncurriculum and training materials for its use of force policies, and attended a training session in \nDecember 2016.  The Panel certified the Department's use of force training complied with \nSection 3.1 as of December 16, 2016.  During the Third Reporting Period, the Panel approved \nthe Department's 16-hour use of force investigation training, and also reviewed and approved the \nDepartment's curriculum and training materials for the ethics and conflict resolution refresher \ntraining courses, and reviewed the curriculum and training materials for the use of force and use \nof force investigations refresher training courses. \n \n  Since the First Reporting Period beginning on July 1, 2015, new deputies have been  \nrequired to complete a six-week Custody Operations course that includes training in ethics, \nprofessionalism and treating inmates with respect, and new Custody Assistants have received \ntraining in these subjects during their nine-week Academy training.  The new deputies also have \nreceived the approved use of force and conflict resolution training in the Academy and the Jail \nContinuum and new Custody Assistants have received use of force training and training in \n\"identifying and working with mentally ill inmates.\"  \n \n  During the Third Reporting Period, existing deputies continued to receive the approved \nethics and conflict resolution training.  Beginning in November 2016 and continuing through the \nThird Reporting Period, they received the  training in the Department's new use of force policies \nthat was approved by the Panel.  Beginning on February 24, 2017 and continuing through the \nThird Reporting Period, sergeants in Custody received the approved training in conducting force \ninvestigations.  The Department reports that it has \"trained 1263 deputies in DeVRT[,] which \nincludes training in 'identifying and working with mentally ill inmates,' 1715 deputies and \ncustody assistants in the Custody Use of Force training, 1632 deputies and custody assistants in \nEthics, and 119 of 128 sergeants in the Supervisors Use of Force Report Writing and \nDocumentation at the Downtown Jail Complex.\"  The Panel intends to retain auditors to audit \n                                                 \n8 For Department members who received the DeVRT training before it was finally \napproved, the first eight-hour refresher course that is required every other year will include the \nadditional subjects added to the DeVRT training after November 6, 2015. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 11 of 15   Page ID\n #:4110\n \nand verify the Department's reported training results after the revised Compliance Measures are \nissued. \n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it \"Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better.\"  Section 3.6 \nrequires unit commanders to review new Department members within six months of being \ninitially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary period.  The \nDepartment has adopted policies that implement Sections 3.5 and 3.6, and it reports that \"in the \nFourth Quarter of 2017, there were no inmates grievances that directly resulted in a finding of \n'Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better.'\"   \n \n4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  The recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the reporting and investigation of \nforce used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are summarized as follows:    \n \n  Section 4.2 requires the Department’s policies to require supervisors investigating the use \nof force by Department members to interview any mental health professionals who \nattempted to resolve the incident without force.  \n \n  Sections 5.1 through 5.3 require the Department to track use of force investigations, \nreviews, and evaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional \ninvestigation of discrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  \n \n  Section 8.3 requires that evaluations of investigations of inmate grievances that \nDepartment members used force to retaliate against inmates should be reviewed by the \nCustody Force Review Committee. \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents. \n \n  Sections 12.2 through 12.5 require the Department to adopt policies and practices \nregarding the interviewing of suspects and inmate witnesses in connection with force \nincidents, the supervisors who conduct the investigations, and the order and format of the \nforce packages. \n \n  Sections 13.1 and 13.2 require the documentation of reasons and reports to the Office of \nInspector General whenever the Department does not terminate a member who has been \nfound to have been dishonest, used excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape \nElimination Act (“PREA”).   \n \n  Section 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of an inmate for \ncriminal prosecution arising from an incident involving the use of force by a Department \nmember and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of \"officer misconduct that may \namount to criminal violations.\"  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 12 of 15   Page ID\n #:4111\n \n \n  Sections 15.1 through 15.7 require the Department to have specific policies and \nprocedures regarding the reporting of force by Department members and the review of \nforce reports by Watch Commanders/Supervising Lieutenants and Unit Commanders.   \n \n  Sections 16.1 through 16.3 require the Department to have medical assessments of \ninmates and Department members involved in force incidents.    \n \nThe Panel reviewed drafts of the Department's policies to implement these recommendations, \nrequired changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had adopted policies to \nimplement these recommendations effective December 1, 2015.  \n \n  As noted above, in the Third Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 75 completed force \npackages of incidents that occurred in 2016 and the first six months of 2017.  The Panel found \nthat Department members' reports of the force they used or witnessed reflected their individual \nperceptions, they reported the force by other members, and the reports were consistent with the \nvideotapes of the incidents from the Closed Circuit Television cameras located throughout the \ncommon areas in the jails.  The Panel noted, however, the members often failed to describe \ninjuries suffered by the inmate as required by the Action Plan, and the Panel was not able to \ndetermine whether the members were separated before they submitted their written reports, as \nalso required by the Plan.  With one exception, every incident was depicted on video (and \nusually by more than one camera), although there were a few instances in which it was difficult \nto see exactly what happened because of the camera angles or the distance between the camera \nand the incident.  In addition, because the CCTV cameras do not have sound, the videos cannot \nalways establish what precipitated the incident.   \n \n  The Panel also found that investigators adhered to policies for the investigation of force \nincidents, which require inmate witnesses to be interviewed away from other inmates and \nsuspects to be interviewed away from the members who used the force, although the interviews \nof witnesses and suspects were often somewhat superficial.  The investigators tended to focus on \nthe suspects' injuries, which is certainly of paramount concern, and gave short-shrift to the \nsuspects' version of the incident.  This may be, in part, because of the availability of video \nevidence, which in most cases clearly shows what happened and usually corroborated the force \nreported by Department members.  In addition, the investigations in late 2016 and early 2017 \nwere conducted by sergeants who had not taken the new use of force investigations training \napproved by the Panel and first offered in late February 2017.  It may, however, also reflect the \npossibility of an inherent bias in favor of an organization's own personnel, in this case the \nDepartment's personnel involved in the force incident.  Although this bias is not unexpected, it is \nincumbent upon the Department and its investigators to make every effort to conduct fair and \nimpartial investigations for the purpose of determining the facts rather than exonerating \nDepartment members. \n  \n  The Panel has experienced difficulties in determining the Department's compliance with \nsome of the provisions (e.g., separation of deputies, timeliness of reports), which may addressed \nwith the use of a checklist that includes all of the provisions of the Action Plan relating to the \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 13 of 15   Page ID\n #:4112\n \nuse, reporting, and investigation of force.  This will help ensure that investigating sergeants \naddress each of the provisions applicable to each force incident in the force package. \n \n  The Panel noted that some of the commanders who reviewed problematic force incidents \nfailed to identify and analyze potential issues with the force used by the Department personnel.  \nEven though the Panel determined that the commanders' conclusions in these cases were not \nunreasonable, the commanders did not analyze sufficiently the tactics and alternatives to the \nforce, or explain the basis for their conclusions that the force was consistent with Department \npolicy.  During a January 2018 monitoring visit, the Panel noted that the reviews by commanders \nwere improved.  The Panel certainly benefits from a more in-depth analysis of these incidents by \nexperienced law enforcement command staff.   \n \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.20 require extensive changes in how the Department handles \ninmate grievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016 the Department issued a new \n\"Inmate Grievance Manual,\" which is Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual, to implement a \nnew grievance system.  It was approved by the Panel after extensive discussions with the \nDepartment and reviews of multiple drafts of the grievance policies.  On December 19, 2016, the \nPanel certified that the Department had adopted policies and practices to implement the \nrecommendations in this section.   \n \n  Section 7.1 through 7.3 require the Department to advise inmates of the voluntary \nConflict Resolution Meeting available under the Department’s Conflict Resolution Policy; advise \ninmates of the results of Department investigations of inmate grievances; and ensure adequate \navenues for constructive prisoner-staff communications.  Section 8.1 requires the Department to \nprohibit personnel from retaliating against inmates.9  The Panel certified that the Department \nadopted policies and practices to implement these recommendations, effective December 1, \n2015.  These policies are part of the grievance system, and will be monitored by the Panel as part \nof the new grievance system. \n \n  During the Third Reporting Period, the Department began to implement the new \ngrievance system, which is a significant challenge given the volume of inmate grievances and \nrequests.  The Panel met with Department's Inmate Grievance Coordinator on several occasions \nto discuss the progress the Department has made in implementing the new system and the reports \ngenerated for the Department's managers regarding inmate grievances and requests, grievances \nagainst staff, and trends at the different facilities.  The Inmate Grievance Coordinator described \nthe Department's plans for the use of iPADs to facilitate the handling of inmate grievances and \nrequests,10 and he reviewed the reports generated for the Department's managers.  The Panel also \n                                                 \n9 Section 8.2 requires the Department to combine polices pertaining to \"Complaints of \nRetaliation\" into one section in the Custody Division Manual.  On July 15, 2016, the Department \nadopted a revised policy in CDM §8-03/050 (Grievance of Retaliation) as part of the inmate new \ngrievance system. \n10 The Department reports that there \"are currently 130 iPads through the facilities and \nthe Department anticipates adding more.\"  As noted by the Department, the iPads \"provide a \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 14 of 15   Page ID\n #:4113\n \nmet with the Inmate Grievance Teams at MCJ and TTCF to assess how the teams are handling \nand tracking inmate grievances and requests at their facilities to ensure that the Department is \nresponding timely.  The Panel believes that the Department is making progress in implementing \na new grievance system to facilitate timely responses that appropriately address inmate \ngrievances and requests, although Plaintiffs report that they have identified \"new and continuing \nproblems with the inmate grievance system.\"    \n   \n  The policies adopted by the Department for the new inmate grievance system do not \n\"establish a centralized unit with sworn personnel, custody assistants, and civilian personnel\" \nthat would be \"co-located\" in the Twin Towers Correctional Facility and the Pitchess Detention \nCenter as required by §6.16, although they do provide for some additional centralized oversight.  \nBased upon interviews with the Inmate Grievance Coordinator, meetings with the Inmate \nGrievance Teams, including interviews by the Monitor in the DOJ case with Inmate Grievance \nTeams at the other facilities,11 the Panel believes that the decentralized grievance system can \neffectively and efficiently handle inmate grievances and requests for service, but the Panel is \nprepared to visit this issue if necessary.   \n \n  Grievances about and requests for medical series are, upon receipt by the Department, \nforwarded directly to the County's Medical Department.  The Panel decided it would not monitor \nthe appropriateness of the medical response to grievances and requests because the Panel does \nnot have the expertise to judge medical diagnostic or treatment issues.  The Panel will, however, \nmonitor the timeliness of response to medical grievances.   \n \n  Inmate grievances about staff conduct, including staff use of force, are subject to a \nlengthy internal investigation process that usually exceeds the 15-day response requirement for \ngrievances against staff.  This is because of the volume and the time it takes to thoroughly \ninvestigate most of these grievances.  The Panel has approved a procedure involving notifying \nthe inmates that the grievances would not be answered in 15 days, but were being reviewed.12 \n \n6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include \"a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints\" identified in this recommendation.  \nThis Department included such a separate section in the Manual, effective December 1, 2015.   \n \n                                                 \nwealth of information to the inmates, including responses to requests for various information[.]\"  \nPlaintiffs are concerned, however, about \"the limited availability to inmates of IPads because of \nscarce out of cell time\" and \"the poor functionality of the IPads caused by the horrific WiFi \naccess in the jails[.]\" \n11 The Monitor in the DOJ case met with the Inmate Grievance teams at the Century \nRegional Detention Facility, the North County Correctional Center, and the Pitchess Detention \nCenter and reviewed the logs of outstanding grievances at these facilities.   \n12 The Department reports that beginning in July 2017, it \"began to conduct weekly \nmeetings with each facility\" focused on outstanding grievances against staff, and that 96% of the \ninvestigations of these grievances received in 2017 had been completed as of January 2018. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 181   Filed 03/22/18   Page 15 of 15   Page ID\n #:4114\n \n  Sections 17.2 through 17.4 and 17.6 through 17.10 require the Department to adopt \nspecific policies for the use of restraints in Custody Operations.  The Panel certified that the \nDepartment adopted policies that implement these recommendations, effective December 1, \n2015.   \n \n  Some of the 75 force packages reviewed by the Panel during the Third Reporting Period \ninvolved force on inmates who were controlled on the ground or placed in restraints, which \nrequired the Department to take steps to minimize breathing problems and medical distress.  The \nPanel did not observe any problematic instances in which inmates experienced these problems, \nbut the Panel recognizes that it will need to examine a larger pool of force packages involving \nincidents in which inmates were subjected to specific security restraints (such as multi-point \nrestraints and Safety Chairs) to be able assess the Department's compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan pertaining to the use of restraints.       \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Sections 19.1 through 19.3 require the Department to develop a formal Early Warning \nSystem to identify potentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel \nagain met with the Department during the Third Reporting Period to discuss the status of the \nEarly Warning System, and the Department provided the factors considered in evaluating \nwhether a \"use of force is potentially problematic,\" which are among the factors that should be \nincluded in a robust Early Warning System.  Although \"the new platform\" was in the testing \nstages\" in the Second Reporting Period, the system was not in use during the Third Reporting \nPeriod. \n \n \n13 \n ",

Leroy Baca, Case No. CV 12-00248-DPP (the \"Rosas\" case) \nprovides that the Court-appointed Monitors (the \"Panel\") will \"prepare and submit to the Parties \nand the Court periodic reports evaluating Defendant’s compliance with the Action Plan \n[developed by the Panel] ('Reports') at intervals the Panel shall determine.\"  This Report sets \nforth the Panel's assessment of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan during the period from July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018 (the \"Fifth \nReporting Period\"), and it is created for the purposes of the settlement of the Rosas case.  In \naccordance with Paragraph V of the Settlement Agreement, it takes into consideration comments \nreceived from the Parties on May 13, 2019, regarding the draft of the report that was sent to them \non April 25, 2019.  The Report also includes reference to some events that occurred after the end \nof the Fifth Reporting Period that the Panel believes have potential impact on Custody \nOperations and reforms mandated by the Settlement Agreement. \n \n  Although the Panel anticipated that it would submit semi-annual reports to the Court on \nor before June 1 (for the fourth quarter of each year and the first quarter of the following year) \nand December 1 (for the second and third quarters),1 the Sheriff's Department's (the \n\"Department\") most recent Self-Assessment Status Report encompasses the Third and Fourth \nQuarters of 2018.2  In order to align the Panel's reports with the Department's time periods, the \nPanel has included in this Report its use of force analysis undertaken in the Third Quarter of \n2018, which was in the Panel's Fourth Report, as well as its analysis in the Fourth Quarter of \n2018.  This will allow the Fifth Report and the Panel's future monitoring reports to coincide with \nthe Department's Self-Assessment reports. \n   \n  In May 2014, the Parties retained the Panel \"to develop a corrective action plan ('Action \nPlan') designed to ensure that [inmates] are not subject to excessive force in the Jail Complex in \ndowntown Los Angeles\" (the \"Downtown Jail Complex\").3  The Implementation Plan developed \nby the Panel (referred to in the Settlement Agreement as an \"Action Plan\") sets forth provisions \nin twenty-one areas that the Los Angeles County Sheriff is required to implement in the \nDowntown Jail Complex.  The Plan was approved by the Court on April 7, 2016.  Under \nParagraph VIII of the Settlement Agreement, \"[w]hen the Panel certifies that any \nrecommendation of the Action Plan has been implemented, it shall commence a period of \nmonitoring the Defendant's compliance with respect to that recommendation ('Compliance \nPeriod').\"   \n \n  As of November 1, 2018, the Sheriff's Department implemented 104 of the Panel's 106 \nrecommendations.  The remaining two recommendations, Section 4.10 (expansion of conflict \nresolution training) and Section 9.1 (security checks), have been superseded by the Settlement \n                                                 \n1 See Panel's Fourth Report, p. 1.   \n2 The Department's Self-Assessment was submitted on March 15, 2019, and Augmented \non March 29, 2019. \n  3 The jails in the Downtown Jail Complex are Men's Central Jail, the Twin Towers \nCorrectional Facility, and the Inmate Reception Center.    \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 4 of 28   Page ID #:4213\n \nAgreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in United States v. County of Los Angeles, et al., \nCV No. 15-05903 (JEMx) (the \"DOJ case\").4   \n \n  The Panel visited the Downtown Jail Complex during the Fifth Reporting Period on July \n9 and 10, 2018, and again on November 1 and 2, 2018.  As in the past, the Panel spoke \ninformally with inmates and Department personnel while touring the jails.  The Panel debriefed \nthe Custody leadership on the Panel's observations of conditions in the jails, and the issues raised \nby inmates during the interviews.      \n \n  On November 1, 2018, the Panel met with Sheriff Jim McDonnell to discuss his oversight \nof the Department's jail operations; the Department's compliance with the Action Plan; the \nPanel's observations concerning conditions in the Downtown Jail Complex; the nature and extent \nof the force used by Department personnel in the jails; and the Panel's recommendation that the \nDepartment expand its use of direct supervision in housing units as an inmate management tool.  \nOn February 22, 2019, during the next reporting period, the Panel met with Sheriff Alex \nVillanueva to discuss his vision for the Department and the Panel's monitoring activities and \nobservations about his role in ensuring that the reforms instituted by the Department continue \nand that Department personnel are held accountable for their conduct.   \n \n  The Panel also had several meetings during the Fifth Reporting Period with the \nDepartment's Inmate Grievance Coordinator and the Inmate Grievance Teams at Men's Central \nJail (\"MCJ\") and the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (\"TTCF\") to review the Department's \nimplementation of its new grievance policies and procedures.   \n \n  On May 10, 2018, the Panel adopted a Revised Monitoring Plan and Compliance \nMeasures (the \"Revised Compliance Measures\"), effective April 1, 2018, that is organized \naround conceptually related topics.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Panel assesses \nthe Department's compliance with the provisions relating to the use, reporting, and investigation \nof force by selecting and reviewing 25 force packages each quarter.   \n     \n  Pursuant to the Panel's request, the Department developed a \"Use of Force Packet \nReview\" checklist to ensure that investigating Sergeants address all applicable provisions of the \nAction Plan and to facilitate the Panel's review of force packages under the Revised Compliance \nMeasures.  On October 29, 2018, the Department issued an Informational Bulletin to Sergeants \n\"tasked with the investigation of a force incident,\" stating that \"The Rosas Use of Force Packet \nReview is a mandatory component of the Department's Supervisor's Report on Use of Force (SH-\nR-438P).\"  The entries on the checklist need to be supported by reports or other documents in the \nforce packages.  Because most of the force incidents reviewed by the Panel during the Third and \nFourth Quarters of 2018 occurred before October 29, 2018, the checklist was used primarily by \nthe Department's Custody Compliance and Sustainability Bureau (\"CCSB\") to review force \npackages before they were sent to the Panel during the Fifth Reporting Period.     \n \n                                                 \n4 The other recommendations in the Rosas Action Plan have been implemented in the \nother jail facilities outside of the Downtown Jail Complex pursuant to Paragraph 81 of \nSettlement Agreement and Stipulated Order of Resolution in the DOJ case. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 5 of 28   Page ID #:4214\n \n  During the Fifth Reporting Period, the Panel reviewed 44 completed force packages that \nwere selected by the Panel from a comprehensive list of force incidents compiled by the \nDepartment.  The packages were selected without input from the Department.5  After reviewing \nthe completed force packages, the Panel met with Custody Commanders after the end of each \nquarter to discuss the force incidents that were of concern to the Panel.  The reporting of the \nforce, the supervisors' investigations, and the Commanders' reviews were also discussed in these \nmeetings.  The Panel subsequently met with Class Counsel to review issues they had identified in \nthe 24 force packages reviewed by the Panel in the Fourth Quarter of 2018.6  This Report reflects \nthe input from both the Custody Commanders and Class Counsel. \n \n     Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Department provides the Panel with self-\nassessments of its compliance with the non-force related provisions in the Action Plan.  All of \nthe Department's results for the training required by the Action Plan are subject to verification by \nauditors retained by the Panel.  Others provisions are subject to verification by the Panel, which \nhas \"the right to select the records that must be reviewed to determine the Department's \ncompliance with the Action Plan [and] to request and review additional records and categories of \nrecords as necessary to assess the Department's Compliance with specific provisions of the \nPlan[.]\"  During the Fifth Reporting Period, as reflected below, the Panel randomly selected and \nreviewed records posted by the Department to verify the Department's self-assessments of its \ncompliance with various provisions.  \n \n  Plaintiff's May 13, 2019 response to the Panel's draft of this Report (\"Plaintiffs' \nResponse\") expresses considerable concern about the Class Counsel's lack of access to County \nrecords.7  The Panel encourages the County to provide Class Counsel with the documentation \nthey need to evaluate the Panel's reports as the Panel appreciates the input it received from the \nparties regarding the draft of this Report.  Nevertheless, this is an issue for the parties to resolve. \nThe Panel believes that it has sufficient information from the Department's documentation and \nSelf-Assessments; the parties' comments to the draft Report, and the Panel's site visits and \ninterviews to make the compliance and non-compliance findings set forth in the Report in \naccordance with Article VIII of the Settlement Agreement. \n \n     \n                                                 \n5 Most of the force incidents reviewed by the Panel in the Fifth Reporting Period \noccurred during the First and Second Quarters of 2018.   \n6 The Panel also discussed with Class Counsel the issues they identified in the force \npackages the Panel reviewed in the First Quarter of 2019, which will be reflected in the Panel's \nnext report to the Court. \n7 See Plaintiffs' Response, p. 3 (expressing concern about the Panel's reliance on the \nDepartment's Self-Assessments because of \"Class Counsel's inability to evaluate compliance \nwith numerous Action Plan provisions due to insufficient data\"); p. 4 (noting that \"deficiencies \n[in existing information] cannot be cured unless the [Department] substantially decreases the \nredactions it applies to the document provided to Class Counsel\"); p. 5 (noting that the Panel has \n\"access to substantially more data than Class Counsel\"); and p. 5 n. 5 (\"Stated differently, Class \nCounsel is not receiving the information which it needs to evaluate the LASD's compliance with \nthe Action Plan\").   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 6 of 28   Page ID #:4215\n \n \n  As has been the case since the beginning of the Initial Reporting Period, the \nDepartment cooperated fully with the Panel during the Fifth Reporting Period.  The Department \nand County Counsel facilitated our visits and inmate interviews, answered our questions, \nresponded to our requests for documents and information, and provided status reports regarding \nthe implementation of the grievance policies and the Early Warning System known as the \nEmployee Review System (\"ERS\").  They also engaged in constructive conversations with the \nPanel about our findings regarding the use of force incidents we had reviewed and the \nDepartment's continuing efforts to implement the terms of the Rosas Action Plan.  We appreciate \ntheir responsiveness, transparency, professionalism, and courtesy in handling our monitoring \nrequests.  Plaintiffs' counsel also has been fully cooperative with the Panel by identifying \ninmates for the Panel to interview and facilitating those interviews; reviewing and commenting \non the Department's use of force packages; and raising and discussing issues relating to the \nPanel's monitoring of the Department's compliance with the Action Plan.      \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 7 of 28   Page ID #:4216\n \nACTION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION \n \n  In the Panel's Fourth Report dated December 1, 2018, for the period from January 1, \n2018, through September 30, 2018, we noted that the staff culture in the jails had changed and \nDepartment members were not using force to punish or retaliate against inmates or force that \nresulted in severe injuries.  During a site visit in November, the Panel did not observe anything \nthat caused any concerns regarding the staff culture or the use of force by Department members.   \nThis is consistent with the observations of the new Assistant Sheriff for Custody who took over \ncustody operations on December 3, 2018.  In his introductory remarks to the Board of \nSupervisors on January 15, 2019, he stated: \n \nI have been asked to come back from retirement and after running the Custody \nDivision, and I can tell you there's a difference between night and day.  I am very \nfamiliar with the Rosas decision and the [Citizens' Commission on Jail Violence] \nC.C.J.V. and walking into the environment and see the changes that have been \nmade now is extremely incredible, and we're going to attempt to sustain [that] \nprocess.   \n \nHe closed by stating, \"Although we're not completely there yet, we are going to continue to \nmove forward in that direction.\"  In addition to having an Assistant Sheriff who is committed to \nimplementing the provisions of the Action Plan, the Department needs a strong, experienced \nCommand Staff in Custody with extensive knowledge of the provisions to achieve and maintain \nCompliance with the Plan for the periods required by the Settlement Agreement.  \n \n  Notwithstanding this cause for optimism, there are some recent developments that are of \nconcern to the Panel.  According to published reports, the Department has reinstated \"two \ndeputies fired for misconduct – one accused of assaulting and harassing a woman and lying \nabout it, the other for using unreasonable force during an arrest.\"  (Los Angeles Times, \"L.A. \nCounty Sheriff Alex Villanueva Reinstates Four More Fired Deputies,\" April 5, 2019.)  The \nDeputy accused of dishonesty was rehired by the Department, notwithstanding that his \ntermination had been upheld by the Civil Service Commission.  Although these Deputies were \nnot members of the Department's Custody Division at the time of the incidents at issue in these \ncases, the Panel is concerned that the reinstatement of Deputies who have been fired for \ndishonesty or excessive use of force sends the wrong message to Department personnel about the \nDepartment's commitments to the on-going reforms in the jails, and to holding Department \npersonnel accountable for such misconduct in the future.   \n \n  Of additional concern is a recent Report of the Interim Inspector General, which \n\"observed a sharp increase in the number of administrative investigations that the Department \nwas inactivating.\"  (Office of Inspector General, \"Report-Back on LASD Internal Administrative \nInvestigations and Dispositions of Disciplinary Actions,\" April 11, 2019, p. 2.)  At the same \ntime, there was a \"marked decrease\" in the number of administrative investigations in the first \nquarter of 2019 as compared to the same time period in prior years.  (Id., p. 3, n. 4.)  According \nto the Report, \"31 investigations appear to have been inactivated based on [a] new directive or \ndirection, as they do not appear to be in conformance with Department policy,\" and in 20 of \nthese deactivated investigations, \"the employees' alleged conduct appears to have been in \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 8 of 28   Page ID #:4217\n \nviolation of Department policy.\"  (Id., p. 3.)  Some of the problematic dispositions identified by \nthe Inspector General's Report involved Department members in Custody operations who failed \nto report force, made false statements, improperly used fixed restraints, failed to timely rescue a \nvictim inmate, conducted inadequate safety checks, and improperly imposed discipline.  \nAlthough these may be isolated cases, the Panel is nevertheless concerned with these instances of \napparent misconduct.  The Panel agrees with the Plaintiffs' observation in their response to the \nPanel's report, that the Department \"cannot have a policy of zero tolerance for dishonesty or \nfailure to report force if it terminates ongoing investigations of personnel alleged to have \nengaged in those forms of misconduct.\"  (Plaintiffs' Response, p. 2.) \n \n  While the Panel recognizes that the Department historically has deactivated \nadministrative investigations for various reasons, the \"sharp increase\" in deactivated \ninvestigations coupled with the \"marked decrease\" in the number of these investigations, calls \ninto question the extent to which the Department will hold Deputies accountable for misconduct, \nincluding in particular dishonesty and excessive use of force, in the future.  Coupled with the \nreinstatements discussed above, the signal it sends to the Custody staff about the direction of the \nDepartment is of concern to the Panel.  \n \n  The change in the Department's approach to discipline is reflected in its response to the \nPanel's draft of this Report, which states that:  \n \n[i]n determining the specific discipline to be issued in a given case, the \nDepartment is taking a holistic approach and addressing systemic shortcomings \nwhich impact staff behavior (e.g., where there is a need for additional training, \nimprovements in policies or procedures, or additional staff or other resources, \netc.). This change in approach increases flexibility for Division leadership without \nreducing consistency in enforcing Department policy or firmness in implementing \ndiscipline when warranted. \n \n(Defendants' Response, p. 2.) \n \n  The Panel understands the need for some \"flexibility\" with respect to the imposition of \ndiscipline to ensure that the punishment is proportionate to the misconduct or violations of \nDepartment policies.  The Panel is concerned, however, about a \"holistic approach\" that seeks to \naddress \"systemic shortcomings\" rather than the Department member's conduct and that will \ninevitably lead to inconsistencies and a lack of \"firmness in implementing discipline when \nwarranted.\"  Such an approach will undermine confidence in the fairness of the disciplinary \nsystem if some members will be punished while others will receive training or mentoring for \nsimilar violations.  It will also undermine the effectiveness of the system to deter misconduct if \nthe consequences for misconduct are likely to be training or mentoring in lieu of discipline.  In \nmany cases, the combination of discipline and training can provide the most impactful outcome.  \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 9 of 28   Page ID #:4218\n \n1.  Leadership, Administration and Management \n \n  The recommendations in Sections 1.1 through 1.4 of the Action Plan require that Custody \nbe headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no other areas of responsibility, the Sheriff be engaged \npersonally in the management of the jails, the Department's managers be held accountable for \nany failures to address force problems in the jails, and the Department regularly report to the \nBoard of Supervisors on the use of force in the jails and on its compliance with the Action Plan.    \n \n  The Department has been in Compliance with Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of the Action Plan \nsince well before January 1, 2017.8  Custody has been headed by an Assistant Sheriff with no \nother areas of responsibility since mid-2014.  It is was under the direction of Assistant Sheriff \nKelly Harrington during most of the Fifth Reporting Period until December 2, 2018, and then for \nthe last month of the reporting period under Assistant Sheriff Robert Olmsted after Sheriff Alex \nVillanueva took office on December 3, 2018.   \n \n  On November 1, 2018, the Panel met with then Sheriff Jim McDonnell, and reviewed his \noversight of the jail facilities and the Panel's findings and observations.  The Department has \nprovided the Panel with a log of the frequent meetings that Sheriff McDonnell and Sheriff \nVillanueva had with the Assistant Sheriffs for Custody Operations from July 1, 2018, through \nDecember 31, 2018, that reviewed use of force data and trends, suicide attempts and rescue \nforce, deployment of chemical agents and personal weapons, facility security concerns, assaults \non staff, use of force against mentally ill inmates, and de-escalation techniques.   \n \n  The Department achieved Compliance with Section 1.3 in the Third Quarter of 2018. \nThere was only one founded disposition for a violation of the Department's use of force policies \nand there were no significant increases in force incidents generally, or Category 3 incidents \nspecifically, in that quarter, and the number of force incidents was down from the prior quarter in \nthe Downtown Jail Complex.  In the Fourth Quarter of 2018 there were no founded dispositions \nfor violations of the Department's use of force policies and one pending investigation.  There \nwere no significant increases in force incidents or Category 3 incidents and the number of force \nincidents was once again down from the prior quarter in each of the facilities.9    \n \n                                                 \n8 Use of the term Compliance in bold is a finding of Compliance as of a certain date, \nwhich in some instances are still subject to verification by the Panel's auditors.  The Panel's \nfindings are set forth on the Appendix attached hereto.  For other provisions, the Department has \neither not achieved Compliance or is no longer in Compliance during this current reporting \nperiod.  Based upon the Panel's findings, the parties will determine whether the Settlement \nAgreement is subject to termination pursuant to Section VIII of the agreement.  As noted in the \nPanel's prior reports, the Panel encourages the \"Parties to adopt a meaningful and achievable \nframework to determine the Department's compliance with the Settlement Agreement\" in the \nfuture.    \n9 Per agreement with the Monitors, the Department's handling of Deputies who have \nmore than a 25% increase in uses of force will be assessed under Sections 19.2 and 19.3, which \ncovers the Department's Employee Review System.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 10 of 28   Page ID\n #:4219\n \n  Plaintiffs question this finding in light of the Panel's stated concern about \"the reluctance \nof reviewing Commanders to find a [problematic] use of force out of policy [and] instead find \nthat troubling incidents raise performance and training issues.\"  See Plaintiffs' Response, p. 6; \nand p. 16, infra.  The Panel believes that it should assess the Commander reviews of Unit \nCommander evaluations  under Section 5.2, which specifies the Commanders responsible for \nreviews of individual incidents, rather than under Section 1.3, which is focused on the nature and \nextent of force incidents in each of the jails, rather than on individual incidents.  Based upon the \nnumber and types of force incidents in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018, it does not appear \nthat the Department has failed to hold Commanders' accountable for force problems in the jails. \n \n  The Department is in Compliance with Section 1.4 as of June 12, 2018, when the \nAssistant Sheriff for Custody Operations reported on the Department's use of force in the jails \nand its implementation of the Rosas Settlement Agreement to the Board of Supervisors.  Because \nSheriff Alex Villanueva assumed office on December 3, 2018, the Panel agreed that the \npresentation to the Board scheduled for December 11, 2018 could be continued to January 2019.  \nThe Assistant Sheriff for Custody Operations and a Commander in Custody made a presentation \nto the Board on January 15, 2019.  The Department provided the Panel with a copy of the \ntranscript of the Department's presentation on that date, and it is in compliance through January \n15, 2019.  \n \n  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 as of June 30, 2018, \nthrough December 31, 2018.  The Sheriff and Assistant Sheriff visited the jail facilities as \nrequired by Section 10.1, as did the Captains, Commanders, and Chiefs.  The Department \ndocumented these visits, along with visits by Watch Commanders, as required by Section 10.2.  \nThe Panel has reviewed the source documents provided by the Department and verified the \nresults reported by the Panel. \n \n  Sections 18.1 and 18.2 require the Department to (1) maintain Custody-wide rotation \npolicies and rotate personnel as required by the policies, and (2) audit each unit’s compliance \nwith its rotation policies.  The Department's Augmented Self-Assessment reports 100% \nCompliance with Section 18.1, and 94% Compliance with Section 18.2 in the Fifth Reporting \nPeriod.  It appears, however, that the Department may have misconstrued Section 18.1 as being \nlimited to requiring each jail to maintaining a rotation policy.  Nevertheless, the Department met \nthe 90% threshold for Compliance because 94% of the Department personnel in the Downtown \nJail facilities were rotated in accordance with the units' policies.10  Further it appears that the \nDepartment assessed whether each of the facilities was in compliance with its rotation policies \nand analyzed the circumstances for \"non-compliance and the corrective action.\"  The Panel has \nreviewed the source documents provided by the Department and verified the results reported by \nthe Panel.11   \n                                                 \n10 The Rotation Polices for each of the Downtown Jail Facilities was updated in January \n2019.   \n11 Although IRC was in compliance with its rotation policies in most instances, the Panel \nnotes that at least five deputies in specialized positions subject to 36-months rotation were in \nthose positions for upwards of 79 to 98 months (that is, from three and a half to five years after \nthe end of the 36 month period). \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 11 of 28   Page ID\n #:4220\n \n   \n  The Department's Self-Assessment reports 100% Compliance with Section 21.1 as of \nJune 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Panel has reviewed the source documents \nprovided by the Department and verified that no member was transferred or assigned to Custody \nas a sanction for problematic conduct.   \n \n2.  Use of Force Policies and Practices \n \n  Section 2.1 of the Action Plan requires the Department to \"have a separate, revised, free-\nstanding, and logically organized Custody Force Manual for Custody Operations[.]\"  On October \n16, 2015, the Department provided the Panel with a Custody Operations Force Manual with \nseparate sections on Use of Force Policy, Use of Force with Special Populations, Restraints, \nEscorting, Chemical Agents, Reporting, Review, Special Weapons, and Deputy-Involved \nShootings.  The Department's Custody Force Manual satisfies Section 2.1 and includes specific \nprovisions that satisfy Sections 8.2 (Complaints of Retaliation), 17.2 (Pregnant Inmates), 20.1 \n(Types of Force), and 20.2 (Definition of Reactive Force) of the Action Plan.  The Department \nhas been in Compliance with these Sections since the Panel began monitoring the Department's \ncompliance as of January 1, 2017. \n \n  The other recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the Department's use of \nforce in Custody Operations are summarized as follows: \n \n  Sections 2.2 through 2.13 require the Department to adopt a comprehensive set of new \nuse of force policies for Custody Operations.   \n \n  Sections 4.1 through 4.5 require the Department to adopt specific use of force policies for \ndealing with mentally ill prisoners.   \n \n  Sections 9.2 through 9.3 require the Department to adopt specific policies for escorting \ninmates after force incidents and intervening to protect inmates as soon as it is reasonably \nsafe to do so.   \n \n  Section 17.5 requires the Department to adopt policies for minimizing the risk of an \ninmate's medical distress during and after a force incident. \n \n  Section 20.3 requires the Department to adopt use of force policies for Planned Force \n(such as cell extractions). \n \nThe Panel reviewed multiple drafts of the Department's policies to implement these \nrecommendations, required changes where appropriate, and certified that the Department had \nimplemented these recommendations, effective December 1, 2015.     \n \n  As noted in the Panel's Fourth Report, the lag time between the occurrence of the force \nincidents and the completion of the investigations has made it difficult for the Department to \nproduce, and for the Panel to review, recent force incidents.  For the Third Quarter of 2018, the \nPanel requested both pending and completed force packages, with the expectation that the \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 12 of 28   Page ID\n #:4221\n \nDepartment would expedite the completion of the pending force packages for review by the \nPanel during the Fourth Reporting Period.  Unfortunately, due to the complexity of some of these \ninvestigations and the enhanced level of review of these investigations by Commanders, the \nDepartment was not able to complete all of the pending investigations requested by the Panel \nbefore the end of the Fourth Reporting Period.  As a result, the Panel only reviewed 20 of the 25 \ndesignated force incidents in the Third Quarter of 2018.   \n \n  It should be noted that the universe of force incidents selected by the Panel includes a \ndisproportionate number of the more serious Category 2 incidents involving the use of personnel \nweapons (punches) by Department personnel.  According to Use of Force statistics provided by \nthe Department for the calendar year 2018, 82.4% of the force incidents in the Downtown Jail \nComplex were either Category 1 incidents or Non-Categorical incidents, and 17.4% were \nCategory 2 incidents.  Further, many of the Category 2 incidents did not involve significant \nforce, but were nevertheless identified as Category 2 incidents based upon a complaint of pain or \na relatively minor head injury such as a cut or bruise.  There were also two Category 3 incidents, \nboth of which were at MCJ.  Notably, there was a significant reduction in the number of force \nincidents in the Downtown Jail Facilities in the second half of 2018, where there was an average \nof 117 force incidents per month, in contrast to the first six months of the year, where there was \nan average of 144 incidents per month. \n \n  As reported in the Panel's Fourth Report, 15 of the 20 completed force packages reviewed \nby the Panel in the Third Quarter of 2018 were in Compliance with the use of force provisions12 \nand the Department did not reach the 90% \"vertical\" threshold for Compliance with the Action \nPlan.  The Panel also concluded that the Department was not in compliance with the following \nspecific provisions of the Action Plan:  head strikes (Section 2.6) and calling supervisors to the \nscene (Section 2.7), and it did not have sufficient information to determine the Department's \ncompliance with the provision pertaining to the use of authorized weapons (Section 2.10).  The \nPanel's overarching concern was that Department members sometimes reacted too quickly in a \nconfined environment instead of waiting for readily available backup resources and taking more \ntime to respond to a recalcitrant inmate.  There were incidents where Department members could \nhave taken advantage of \"time and distance\" to de-escalate the situation and avoid using force \naltogether or to plan a potentially safer use of force.    \n \n  In the Fourth Quarter of 2018, the Panel reviewed 24 force incidents, consisting of a \ncombination of investigations that were already completed and pending investigations that were \ncompleted during the period.  The Panel concluded that 19 of the 24 packages reviewed were in \nCompliance with the use of force provisions, and that the Department did not reach the 90% \n\"vertical\" threshold for Compliance with the Action Plan.  The Panel also concluded that the \nDepartment was not in compliance with the following provisions of the Action Plan:  force \nprevention principles (Section 2.2), head strikes (Section 2.6) and use of chemical agents and \nTasers (Sections 2.10 and 11).  It should be noted, however, as pointed out by the Department in \nits response to the Panel's draft of this Report, force incidents involving head strikes or Tasers \nmade \"up less than 1 and 3 percent of the total uses of force\" during the second half of 2018.  \n                                                 \n12 In the case involving the violation of the Department's cell extraction policies the force \nitself was not unreasonable.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 13 of 28   Page ID\n #:4222\n \nFurther, incidents involving personal weapons (punches) \"made up only five percent of total uses \nof force.\"  (Defendant's Response, p. 3.)  \n \n  The Panel has an on-going concern about Department members using punches to control \nresisting inmates, which often occurs when the inmates are on the ground and Department \nmembers are trying to handcuff them.  Using punches when necessary to defend against \nassaultive inmates who pose a serious risk of injury to the Department members is, of course, \nwell-within Department policies.   \n \n  The Panel reviewed the problematic incidents with Custody Commanders during the \nPanel's site visits.  Although the Commanders did not necessarily agree that the force in these \ncases violated the Department's use of force polices, they noted that they had ordered corrective \naction consisting of additional training of Department personnel in several of these cases.  \nDuring the Panel’s meetings with Commanders, the Panel recommended that the Department use \nankle restraints when moving high risk inmates to increase safety for staff and other inmates. \n \n  Plaintiffs' Response to the draft of this Report expressed concern about the \"use of a \nvertical assessment to determine [the Department's] compliance with the Action Plan and \nSettlement Agreement.\"  (Plaintiffs' Response, p. 3.)13  Their concern is unfounded.  The use of \nthe vertical assessment gives a realistic assessment of the reasonableness of each use of force \nincident taking into consideration all of the applicable provisions of the Action Plan, and the \nDepartment is required to establish that 90% of the force incidents satisfy that vertical \nassessment.  The Panel also undertakes a horizontal assessment of the Department's compliance \nwith each of the applicable provisions of the Plan, which is not based upon a percentage \nthreshold.  Once the Department meets the 90% threshold for the vertical assessments, the Panel \nreports on its horizontal assessments of the Department's compliance with each applicable \nprovision.  Since the Department did not reach the 90% threshold for the vertical assessment \nduring the Fifth Reporting Period, this Report only discusses the Panel's horizontal assessments \nof provisions that are of particular concern to the Panel.14  By employing both methods of \nassessment, the Panel believes that it is holding the Department to a high standard of compliance. \n \n                                                 \n13 Plaintiffs also acknowledge, however, that it is the Panel's \"prerogative\" to draft the \nrevised Compliance Measures.  (Plaintiffs' Letter, p. 2.)  Although it would be easier for the \nPanel to simply provide its subjective assessment of the Department's compliance with each of \nthe provisions in the Action Plan, the Panel believed that it was important to develop Compliance \nMeasures so that the Department would have an understanding of what is required to achieve \ncompliance, and both parties would know how the Panel is determining Compliance.    \n14 There were some provisions for which the Panel was unable to conduct a horizontal \nassessment, which is a prerequisite to finding Compliance with the Use of Force Provisions.  For \nexample, one problem noted by the Panel was the lack of enough cases involving planned use of \nforce and cell extractions involving mentally ill inmates, which precluded the Panel from \nconducting horizontal assessments of Sections 4.1 through 4.5 (Use of Force on Mentally Ill \nInmates).  In future reporting periods, the Panel will select a random sample of such cases from a \nseparate list that the Department has now generated.      \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 14 of 28   Page ID\n #:4223\n \n  The Department's response to the draft of this Report urged the Panel to take the \nDepartment's \"thorough investigations, and the variety of counseling, education, training and \ndiscipline that often results from them, into consideration in determining the Department's \ncompliance with its Rosas obligations.\"  (Department's Response, p. 4.)  While the Panel does \ntake into consideration the quality of the investigations and the discipline imposed, the Panel is \nconcerned that the Department is often reluctant to find violations that should be subject to \ndiscipline; the Panel does not view \"counseling, education, [and] training\" to be \"forms of \ndiscipline.\"  It may be, as suggested by the Department, that Commanders at all levels will be \nless reluctant to find misconduct or policy violations going forward if there is greater flexibility \nin the imposition of discipline.  The Panel believes that the imposition of discipline sends a \nmessage regarding accountability quite apart from the harshness of the specific penalty.       \n \n  The statistics are consistent with what the Panel observed during the Fifth Reporting \nPeriod.  The Panel visited the jails on two occasions, and had discussions with a number of \ninmates during these visits.  Once again, the Panel did not hear complaints from inmates in these \nformal discussions about excessive force by Department personnel.  These inmates indicated that \nDepartment personnel have not used force to retaliate against, or punish, inmates, and they often \nvolunteered that they did not encounter the excessive use of force that had been present in the \njails years ago.  \n \n3.  Training \n \n  Sections 3.1 through 3.4 of the Action Plan require that Department members receive \ntraining on use of force policies and on ethics, professionalism, and treating inmates with \nrespect; and that new Department members receive six weeks of Custody-specific training in the \nAcademy or the Jail Continuum in Custody Operations.  Sections 4.6 through 4.9 require the \nDepartment to provide Custody-specific, scenario-based, skill development training for existing \nand new personnel in Crisis Intervention and Conflict Resolution and in \"identifying and \nworking with mentally ill inmates.\"  Section 12.1 requires that Custody Sergeants receive \ntraining in conducting use of force investigations.    \n \n  The Department's training results are subject to audit by the Panel's auditors.  All of the \nDepartment's reported results for the initial training of existing Deputy Sheriffs and Custody \nAssistants and for new members in the Jail Operations Continuum or the Academies set forth \nbelow have been verified by the Panel's auditors.  The auditors verified that the Department's \nnew members had received the required initial training from when it was first offered through the \n\"as of\" date reported by the Department for the completion of the initial training required for \nexisting Deputies.  Accordingly, the Panel has deemed the Department to be in Compliance \"as \nof\" the date reported by the Department for the completion of the initial training required for \nexisting Deputies.    \n \n  Going forward, the Department is required to provide refresher training annually or every \nother year in each of the areas required by Sections 3.1 through 3.4 and 4.6 through 4.9 of the \nAction Plan.  The Department's reported results on the initial refresher training have been \nverified by the auditors so that the Department is still in Compliance with the training provisions \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 15 of 28   Page ID\n #:4224\n \nas set forth below.  The Department's reports on future refresher training will also be subject to \nverification by the Panel's auditors.     \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing \nDeputies and Custody Assistants in the Downtown Jail Complex had received the initial eight-\nhour use of force training required by Section 3.1.15  The Department's most recent Self-\nAssessment reports that 96% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed \nthe required refresher course.16  The Department is in Compliance with Section 3.1 as of June \n30, 2018. \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 95% of the existing \npersonnel received the initial four-hour training course in ethics, professionalism, and treating \ninmates with respect as required by Section 3.2.  The Department's most recent Self-Assessment \nreports that 95% of the trained Deputy Sheriffs and Custody Assistants completed the required \nrefresher course.  The Department is in Compliance with Section 3.2 as of June 30, 2018. \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 97% of the existing \nDeputies at the Downtown Jail Complex and the mental health unit at the Century Regional \nDetention Facility (\"CRDF\") received the 32 hours of training on Crisis Intervention and \nConflict Resolution Training, including the eight hours of identifying and working with mentally \nill inmates, required by Sections 4.6 and 4.7; and 98% of the remaining Deputies at CRDF, and \nall Deputies at the North County Correctional Facility (\"NCCF\"), and the Pitchess Detention \nCenter (\"PDC\") jails received the eight hours training in identifying and working with mentally \nill inmates required by Section 4.7.  The Department's recent Self-Assessments report that 96% \nof the Deputies in the Downtown Jail Complex and the mental health unit at CRDF and 97% of \nthe remaining Deputies at CRDF and the Deputies at the other facilities received the required \nrefresher training as of December 31, 2018.  The Department is in Compliance with Section 4.6 \nand 4.7 as of June 30, 2018.  \n \n  The Department has reported since the First Reporting Period that, beginning on July 1, \n2015, newly assigned Deputies have been required to complete a six-week Custody Operations \ncourse that includes training in use of force and ethics, professionalism and treating inmates with \nrespect, and new Custody Assistants have received training in these subjects during their \nAcademy training.  The Department reported that as of June 30, 2018, 95% of the new Deputies \nand 100% of the new Custody Assistants have received the six weeks of custody training \n                                                 \n15 The use of force training that was approved by the Panel includes the custody-based \nuse of force scenarios in Compliance with Section 3.4.  \n16 The Panel granted the Department extensions for Deputies who received the basic use \nof force training in 2017 and 2018 for completion of the initial refresher courses.  The Panel \nexpects Department personnel to complete future refresher courses before the end of December \nof the years in which they are required.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 16 of 28   Page ID\n #:4225\n \nrequired by Section 3.3.17  The Department is in Compliance with Section 3.3 as of June 30, \n2018.18 \n \n  The Department previously reported that 98% of new Deputies had received the approved \nconflict resolution training in the Academy and the Jail Continuum, and 100% of newly assigned \nCustody Assistants had received the conflict resolution (DeVRT) training and training in \n\"identifying and working with mentally ill inmates\" required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 as of June \n30, 2018.  The Department Self-Assessment reports that 98% of new Deputies and 100% of new \nCustody Assistants received the training required by Sections 4.8 and 4.9 in the Third Quarter of \n2018, and 100% of newly assigned Deputies and Custody Assistants received the required \ntraining in the Fourth Quarter of 2018.  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 4.8 and \n4.9 as of June 30, 2018. \n \n  The Department previously reported that as of June 30, 2018, 90.4% of the Sergeants \nassigned to Custody as of October 1, 2016, had received the 16 hours of training in conducting \nuse of force investigations required by Section 12.1.  The Department's Self-Assessment reports \nthat 91% of the existing Sergeants have received the required refresher training and that 97% of \nthe Sergeants newly promoted in Custody in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018 have \nreceived the required training.   \n \n  Section 3.5 requires Unit Commanders to determine \"what additional training, counseling \nor mentoring may be required when a personnel complaint involving the use of force is resolved \nwith a finding that it 'Appears Employee Conduct Could Have Been Better;' direct that the \nDepartment member undergo such additional training, counseling, or mentoring; and document \nthe action taken.\"  The Department's Self -Assessment reports that there was one such case in the \nSecond Quarter of 2018, which was in Compliance with Section 3.5; no such cases in the Third \nQuarter of 2018; and two such cases in the Fourth Quarter of 2018, both of which were in \nCompliance.  The supporting documentation initially provided by the Department, however, only \nshowed the required \"additional training\" for one of the two cases in the Fourth Quarter of 2018.  \nSubsequently, the Department submitted documentation showing that there was a debriefing \nafter the force incident in the second case.   \n \n  Focusing on the \"may be required\" language in Section 3.5, the Department's response to \nthe draft of this Report suggests that it can be satisfied by the usual debriefing that occurs after a \nforce incident.  (Defendant's Response, p. 4.)  The Panel disagrees with this interpretation; \nSection 3.5 requires the Unit Commander to determine \"what additional training, counseling, or \nmentoring may be required,\" direct the member to \"undergo such additional training, counseling \n                                                 \n17 New Deputies are also required to undergo the refresher training each year or each two \nyears after they have been assigned to a custody facility.  The refresher training results for new \nDeputies are included in the refresher training results for existing Deputies because they are no \nlonger considered to be new Deputies when they are required to undergo the refresher training. \n18 The Department's most recent Self-Assessments report that 96% of newly assigned \nDeputies and 100% of newly assigned Custody Assistants received the required training in use of \nforce and ethics in the Third Quarter of 2018 and 100% of the newly assigned Deputies and \nCustody Assistants received the required training during the Fourth Quarter of 2018. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 17 of 28   Page ID\n #:4226\n \nor mentoring,\" and document it.  Section 3.5 requires something more than a debriefing when a \nmember's conduct \"Could Have Been Better,\" and the Department was out of compliance with \nSection 3.5 as of the end of the Fifth Reporting Period.   \n \n  Section 3.6 requires Unit Commanders to review new Department members within six \nmonths of being initially assigned to Custody and again before the end of their probationary \nperiod.  Based upon a random selection of personnel records, the Department reports that 89.3% \nof the new Department members were reviewed as required by Section 3.6 in the second six \nmonths of 2018, which is below the 95% threshold for Compliance.    \n \n4.  Reporting and Investigation of Force Incidents \n \n  Many of the recommendations in the Action Plan that pertain to the reporting and \ninvestigation of force used by Department personnel in Custody Operations are assessed by the \nPanel through a review of the completed force packages.  Other provisions are reported by the \nDepartment as follow:   \n \n  Section 5.1 requires the Department to track use of force investigations, reviews, and \nevaluations; review evaluations of force incidents; and conduct additional investigation of \ndiscrepancies and unexplained tactical decisions.  The Department reports 92% of the \nforce incidents in the Third Quarter of 2018 were timely entered into the database as \nrequired by Section 5.1, and 95% were timely entered in the Fourth Quarter of 2018, \nwhich equals the 95% threshold required for Compliance as of the end of the Fourth \nQuarter.  The Panel has reviewed the source documents provided by the Department and \nverified the results reported by the Department.19   \n \n  Section 8.3 requires that investigations of inmate grievances that Department members \nused force to retaliate against inmates should be evaluated by the Custody Force Review \nCommittee.  The Department reports that it did not achieve Compliance with this \nprovision in either the Third or Fourth Quarters of 2018.   \n \n  Section 11.1 requires that the Custody Force Rollout Team’s involvement in reviewing \nforce incidents not delay the Department’s investigation of the force incidents.  The \nCompliance Measure requires that \"95% of the investigations reviewed by CFRT were \nnot delayed beyond the period permitted by law for imposing discipline.  The Department \npreviously reported that that it achieved Compliance with Section 11.1 in the Second \nQuarter of 2018.  Because there were no use of force incidents in which there was a \nfinding of a policy violation or misconduct in either the Third or Fourth Quarters of 2018, \n                                                 \n19The Department's Self-Assessment finding for the Fourth Quarter of 2018 is based upon \na finding that more than 95% of the incidents were entered into the database \"within two hours \nafter the end of the shift.\"  The Panel agreed to this modification to account for force incidents \nthat occur at the end of a shift.  The Panel notes that the Department's supporting documents \nreflect that the vast majority of incidents are entered into the database within or shortly two hours \nafter the incident. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 18 of 28   Page ID\n #:4227\n \nthe predicate for determining compliance with Section 11.1 did not exist in those \nquarters, and therefore it remains in Compliance with this provision.   \n \n  Section 13.1 requires the Department to \"have a firm policy of zero tolerance for acts of \ndishonesty or failure to report uses of force.\"  Section 13.1 and 13.2 require the \ndocumentation of reasons and reports to the Office of Inspector General whenever the \nDepartment does not terminate a member who has been found to have been dishonest, \nused excessive force, or violated the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act (\"PREA\").  The \nDepartment reports that there were no incidents in the Third or Fourth Quarters of 2018 \nthat were subject to Sections 13.1 and 13.2, and therefore it remains in Compliance with \nthese provisions.      \n \n  Sections 14.1 and 14.2 require (1) an additional review of referrals of inmates for \ncriminal prosecution arising from incidents involving the use of force by Department \nmembers and (2) timely referrals to the District Attorney of \"officer misconduct that may \namount to criminal violations.\"  The Department reports 100% in Compliance with \nSection 14.1 in the Third Quarter of 2018, and 96% in the Fourth Quarter of 2018.  With \nrespect to Section 14.2, there was one timely criminal referral to the District Attorney in \nthe Third Quarter of 2018, and \"no criminal filings on Department personnel related to \nforce for the Fourth Quarter of 2018.\"20  The one case that was referred to the District \nAttorney in the Third Quarter of 2018 concerned an incident that occurred two years \nearlier.  The incident was under investigation by the Internal Criminal Investigations \nBureau during that time and was referred well-within the statute of limitations.  \nAccordingly, the Department is in Compliance with Section 14. 2 as of the Third Quarter \nof 2018.   \n   \n  As noted in the Panel's Fourth Report, the Panel reviewed 20 (rather than the required 25) \ncompleted force packages in the Third Quarter of 2018 to assess compliance with the provisions \nof the Action Plan relating to the reporting and investigation of force incidents.  The Panel \nconcluded that 17 out of the 20 (or 85%) were in Compliance with these provisions, which was \nbelow the 90% \"vertical\" threshold for Compliance.  The Panel concluded that the Department \nwas not in compliance with the provision regarding the location of inmate witness interviews \n(Section 12.2).  In addition, the information provided by the Department was often not sufficient \nfor the Panel to determine the Department's compliance with provisions relating to the timeliness \nof reports (Section 15.2), and the separation of Department personnel after a force incident \n(Section 15.6).     \n \n  The Panel concluded that 20 of the 24 completed force packages reviewed in the Fourth \nQuarter of 2018 were in Compliance, which is below the 90% \"vertical\" threshold for \n                                                 \n20 The Panel notes that Section 14.2 is not limited to force incidents.  In its response to \nthe draft of this Report, the Department states that its \"reporting in this category is limited to \nreferrals to the District Attorney's Office by the Department of alleged misconduct by members \nof the Custody Division, those referrals are not limited to incidents involving the use of force.\"  \n(Department's Response, p. 6.)  The Panel agrees that 14.2 is limited to members of Custody \nDivision and is not limited to incidents involving the use of force.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 19 of 28   Page ID\n #:4228\n \nCompliance.  The Panel is concerned that reviewing Commanders are reluctant to find a use of \nforce out of policy (and therefore subject to discipline) even when they acknowledge that the \nforce was problematic, and they will instead find that troubling incidents raise performance and \ntraining issues.  The Panel also notes that the Department did not achieve Compliance with the \nrequirement for the timely completion of force reports (Section 15.2), and the Panel was unable \nto determine if the Department was in Compliance with the requirement that personnel be \nseparated prior to completing their required reports (Section 15.6). \n \n  Plaintiffs' May 13, 2019 response to the draft of this Report states that \"Class Counsel has \nidentified several force packages where [Department] employees appear to dishonestly present \ntheir uses of force but supervisors who review the report do not appear to address—or punish—\nsuch dishonesty.\"  (Plaintiffs' Response, p. 6.)  Plaintiffs cite three force incidents in their \nresponse.  (Id., n. 8).  These cases were reviewed by the Panel in the Fourth Quarter of 2018, and \nthe Panel's vertical assessments found that the reporting/investigations of these incidents were \nnot in compliance with the Action Plan, although the Panel did not conclude that the issues of \nconcern involved dishonesty.  It should be noted however, that in the Fourth Quarter of 2018 the \nPanel found only one additional case that was not in compliance with the reporting/investigation \nprovisions.  While 20 out of 24 cases (83.6%) in compliance is below the 90% threshold for \nCompliance, the vast majority of the cases reviewed by the Panel did not have the problems \nidentified by the Plaintiffs.     \n \n5.  Inmate Grievances  \n \n  The Action Plan requires extensive changes in how the Department handles inmate \ngrievances and requests for service.  On July 15, 2016, the Department issued a new \"Inmate \nGrievance Manual\" (Volume 8 of the Custody Division Manual) to implement a new grievance \nsystem.  The Panel assessed the Department's implementation of the new grievance system as \nfollows: \n \n  Sections 6.1 through 6.6 require that separate forms for inmate grievances be reasonably \navailable to inmates and that the forms have specific check boxes.  Section 7.1 requires the \nDepartment to advise inmates of the voluntary Conflict Resolution Meeting available under the \nDepartment’s Conflict Resolution Policy.21  Based upon site visits during the Fifth Reporting \nPeriod, the Panel concluded that the forms meeting these requirements of the Action Plan are still \nreasonably available to inmates, and the Department is in Compliance with those provisions \nrelating to the availability of the required forms.   \n \n  Sections 6.4 and 6.5 also require the Department to establish that use of force grievances \nand retaliation grievances against staff are brought to the attention of Unit Commanders within \n10 days and properly handled.  Based upon a review of the relevant grievances in the randomly \n                                                 \n21 Although the grievance forms have the required notification right above the inmate's \nsignature, the Department reports that no grievances were resolved through the Conflict \nResolution Policy in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018.  The Panel encourages the \nDepartment to seek alternative means of communicating the availability of the voluntary Conflict \nResolution Policy.    \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 20 of 28   Page ID\n #:4229\n \nselected month, the Department reports 100% Compliance with these provisions in the Third \nQuarter of 2018.  The Department also reports that it achieved the 90% threshold for \nCompliance for Section 6.4 in the Fourth Quarter of 2018, but the Augmented Self-Assessment \nreports that it only achieved Partial Compliance for Section 6.5 in that quarter because the \nrelevant grievances against staff were not brought timely to the Unit Commander at MCJ.       \n \n  Sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the Action Plan set forth specific requirements for the \ndetermination, handling, and notifications of non-medical emergencies.  Based upon the \nselection and review of the grievances marked \"emergency\" in the month randomly selected by \nthe Panel, the Department reports 100% Compliance with Sections 6.7 and 6.8 for the Third and \nFourth Quarters of 2018.22  The results for Sections 6.7 and 6.8 have been verified by the Panel.  \nAlthough some of the grievances that the Department determined were non-emergent could be \nviewed as more pressing, the Department handled the grievances expeditiously as required by the \nnature of the grievance.  Accordingly, the Department is in Compliance with these provisions \nfor the period July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018.   \n \n  Section 6.9 requires that emergency grievances be forwarded to the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator.  Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15 require the Inmate Grievance Coordinator to track the \nDepartment's handling of inmate grievances, provide a monthly report to the Unit Commander \nand senior management in Custody on the status of inmate grievances, and analyze inmate \ngrievances for problematic trends.  The Panel met with the Department's Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator during both site visits in the Fifth Reporting Period to review the Department's \nimplementation of the new grievance system and the reports generated for the Department's \nmanagers regarding inmate grievances and requests, grievances against staff, and trends at the \ndifferent facilities.  The Department provided documentation to the Panel showing that for the \nThird and Fourth Quarters of 2018, the Inmate Grievance Coordinator received the information \nabout emergency grievances required by Section 6.9 and prepared detailed reports for managers \nrequired by Sections 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.  The Department is in Compliance with Sections 6.9, \n6.13, 6.14, and 6.15, as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  \n \n  Sections 6.10 and 6.12 require that grievances be collected daily, logged in, and tracked \nin an inmate grievance database.  The Department's Augmented Self-Assessment reports that \n94% of the grievances were collected timely in the Third Quarter of 2018 and 85% in the Fourth \nQuarter of 2018,23 which is below the 95% threshold for Compliance with Section 6.10.  The \nDepartment reports that 100% of the grievances in the randomly selected months in the Third \nQuarter of 2018 were entered into the database and handled as required by Section 6.12.  The \nDepartment also reports that 98% of the grievances were entered and tracked in the database and \n                                                 \n22 The Department determined that the first 50 grievances marked \"emergency\" were not \nactually emergencies.  The Department identified only four grievances in September 2018 that \nwere actual emergencies and determined that they were handled in accordance with Section 6.7.    \n23 The Department reports that its Fourth Quarter 2018 results \"were non-compliant due \nto 'programming errors' that prevented its scanners from properly recording the time the \ngrievances were collected from the locked grievance boxes.\" \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 21 of 28   Page ID\n #:4230\n \n100% were reviewed within 24 hours in the Fourth Quarter of 2018.  Accordingly, the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 6.12 as of the Third Quarter 2018.24     \n \nSection 6.11 requires that the Custody Division Manual provide that failing to comply \nwith Department policies requiring proper handling of inmate grievances may be cause for \ndiscipline.  The Department previously reported that it \"did not complete any investigations for \nthe relevant type of grievances in Second Quarter 2018.\"  For the Fifth Reporting Period, the \nDepartment reports that one such incident was identified, but it was subsequently \"determined \nthe grievance did not meet the requirements of 6.11.\"  The Panel notes, however, that the Interim \nInspector General's April 11, 2019 report indicates that a supervisor \"located over 200 inmate \nrequests/grievances in drawers, some of which were about a year old and had not been \naddressed.\"   \n \nThe Department reports that it \"took very seriously [this] incident identified by OIG.\"  \nThe Inmate Grievance Coordinator \"was tasked with personally inspecting all of the drawers of \neach grievance sergeant at every facility via unannounced visits to ensure that the situation \ndescribed was an isolated incident.  Further, the Department began hosting town halls for \ninmates specifically focused on the grievance process.\"   \n \nThe Department is also working to make the \"grievance process accessible by inmates \nelectronically. . .without the involvement of custody staff[.]\"  During a recent site visit, members \nof the Panel were impressed with a demonstration of the system by an inmate in TTCF.  Once \nimplemented throughout the County jails, it will expedite the handling of inmate grievances and \nrequests and \"dramatically reduce the involvement of custody staff\" in the process.  The Inmate \nGrievance Coordinator's best, although admittedly rough, estimate was that the entire grievance \nprocess will be available electronically to inmates in 24 months. \n \nThe Department's progress was reflected in comments from inmates in recent site visits.  \nThe complaints from inmates heard by the Panel tended to focus on the substance of the response \nto a grievance rather than a lack of response.  This allowed for discussions of the essence of an \ninmate's concerns rather than a lack of response. \n \n  Sections 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, and 7.2 set forth the deadlines for filing use of force and \nPREA grievances,25 the Department's initial responses, inmates' right to appeal, and the \nDepartment's notifications of the results of the investigations.  The Department previously \nprovided reports reflecting that it adhered to these deadlines for all grievances selected pursuant \n                                                 \n24 The Panel had concerns that the source documents do not always support the \nDepartment's findings because the dates stamped on the grievances are not consistent with the \n\"Grievance Reviewed\" date in the Department's electronic records.  In response, the Department \n\"explained that the collecting sergeants initially review the grievances to determine if immediate \naction is required.  They stamp each grievance with a date and time that reflects both the \ncollection and initial review.  The [review] date in the electronic records is, however, the last \ndate the grievance was reviewed.\"  The Department acknowledged the \"confusion and has \nrevised its audit tools. . .to better clarify this process.\" \n25 Section 6.18 provides that there is no deadline for filing PREA grievances.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 22 of 28   Page ID\n #:4231\n \nto the applicable Compliance Measures during the Second Quarter of 2018 for Sections 6.17 (use \nof force),26 6.18 (PREA), and 6.20 (right to appeal).  The Department's Self-Assessment reports \nthat it has adhered to these deadlines for these grievances in both the Third and Fourth Quarters \nof 2018.  It also reports that it adhered to the deadlines for advising inmates of adjudications as \nrequired by Section 7.2 for the Fourth Quarter of 2018.  The documentation provided by the \nDepartment supports its reported findings, and the Panel agrees that the Department is in \nCompliance with Sections 6.17, 6.18, and 6.20 as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, \nand with Section 7.2 as of October 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  The Department's \nAugmented Self-Assessment reports it was not in Compliance with Section 6.19 because it did \nnot achieve the 90% threshold for responding to grievances that are not against staff within 15 \ndays. \n \n  The policies adopted by the Department for the new inmate grievance system do not \n\"establish a centralized unit with a sworn supervisor, custody assistants, and civilian personnel\" \nthat is \"co-located\" in TTCF and PDC as required by Section 6.16.  The policies do, however, \nprovide for additional centralized oversight.  Based upon interviews with the Inmate Grievance \nCoordinator, meetings with the Inmate Grievance Teams, including interviews by the Monitor in \nthe DOJ case with Inmate Grievance Teams at the other facilities, the Panel believes that the \ndecentralized grievance system is effectively and efficiently handling inmate grievances and \nrequests for service with quicker resolutions and, therefore, the Department is in Compliance \nwith this provision. \n \n  The Panel found the Department in Compliance with Section 6.16 in the draft of its \nFourth Report, which was submitted to the parties on October 17, 2018, and filed with the Court \non November 15, 2018.  Plaintiffs' response to the Panel's draft of the Fourth Report, dated \nOctober 29, 2018, did not object to this finding.  In their response to the Panel's draft of the Fifth \nReport, dated May 13, 2019, Plaintiffs have objected to this finding because the \"Monitors have \noverstepped the bounds of their authority\" and \"must receive the Court's approval\" if it wants to \n\"redraft Section 6.16 of the Action Plan.\"  (Plaintiffs' Response, p. 7.)  The Panel disagrees with \nthe Plaintiffs' assertion that this constitutes a re-draft; the Department has a centralized unit \nunder the direction of an Inmate Grievance Coordinator and it has Inmate Grievance Teams at \neach of the Downtown Jail Facilities as well as at CRDF, NCCF and PDC North (for both North \nand South).  The Panel believes that current system is consistent with the intention of the Panel \nin drafting Section 6.16 as long as it \"is effectively and efficiently handling inmate grievances \nand requests for service.\"27   \n \n  Section 7.3 requires the Department to \"ensure that there are adequate avenues for \nconstructive prisoner-staff communication[.]\"  The Department's Self-Assessment reports that \nthe Department was in Compliance with Section 7.3 during both the Third and Fourth Quarters \nof 2018.  The Department provided logs of Town Hall meetings at MCJ and TTCF during the \n                                                 \n26 The Department previously reported that it accepts all use of force investigations.   \n27 Panel does not, however, have any objection if the parties want to propose a revision of \nSection 6.16 as long as it provides for an effective and efficient system.

The Panel is of the view that the \nDepartment is in Compliance with Section 7.3 as of June 30, 2018, through December 31, 2018. \n \n  Section 8.1 prohibits Department personnel from retaliating against inmates.  The \nDepartment previously reported summaries reflect that the Department was in Compliance with \nSection 8.1 as of March 31, 2018, in that discipline was imposed for the one founded grievance \nin the First Quarter of 2018 and for the two founded grievances in the Second Quarter of 2018.28  \nThe Department reports that there were no founded violations of the anti-retaliation policy in the \nThird or Fourth Quarters of 2018.  The Department subsequently reported that it \"incorrectly \nidentified and reported two events as \"Founded\" violations of the Anti-Retaliation policy, when \nin fact there was no such violation.\"  In these cases, several Department members received a \nPerformance Log Entry (\"PLE\") because their conduct, while not a violation of the policy,  \n\"could or should have been better.\"29 \n \n  The Plaintiffs have expressed a concern about the enforcement of the Anti-Retaliation \nnow that the Department has reverted back to the 2012 disciplinary guidelines in light of a court \ndecision invalidating subsequent guidelines.  (Plaintiff's Letter, p. 2.)  The Panel believes, \nhowever, that the Department has ample authority to discipline members for violations of the \nAnti-Retaliation Policy, which are likely to violate other Department and Custody manual \nprovisions as well, even if there is no specific guideline range for retaliating against inmates.  \nThe County reports that the Department's Anti-Retaliation Policy has been \"in place since \nFebruary 2012, before the September 2012 guidelines were adopted.  Discipline for violations of \nthat policy under the 2012 guidelines are considered under the rubric of 'Performance to \nStandards' which provides for a discipline range of '[written reprimand] to discharge.'\" \n \n6.  Use of Restraints \n \n  Section 17.1 requires that the Custody Force Manual include \"a separate section that sets \nforth the general principles governing the use of restraints\" identified in this recommendation.  \nThe Department included such a separate section in the Manual, and is in Compliance with this \nrequirement of Section 17.1, effective December 1, 2015. \n   \n  Sections 17.1, 17.3, 17.4, and 17.6 through 17.9 (the \"Restraint Provisions\") of the \nAction Plan require the Department to provide the Panel \"with a list of incidents in which \n                                                 \n28 Plaintiffs assert that the Panel should review how the grievances were investigated or \nthe basis of the Department's findings of a violation of the anti-retaliation policy and the PLE.  \n(Plaintiffs' Response, p. 7.)  Neither Section 8.1 nor the Compliance Measures require the \nDepartment to provide this information.  Further, the Panel will be in a position to assess the \nreasonable of any discipline imposed based upon the Department's finding.   \n29 The Panel does not consider a PLE to be discipline.  A Unit Performance Log signed by a \nDepartment Member in the source documents provided by the Department states that the \nmember was \"counseled\" about the violation and \"understood that any further violation may \nresult in disciplinary action.\"      \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 24 of 28   Page ID\n #:4233\n \ninmates were placed in a Safety Chair, restrained to a fixed object for more than 20 minutes, \nsubjected to security restraints for an extended length of time. . .or subjected to a multi-point \nrestraint in the Downtown Jail Complex[.]\"  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, the Panel \nis supposed to select and review 25 incidents involving Security Restraints from the \nDepartment's list to assess the Department's compliance with the security restraint provisions.   \n \n  During the Fifth Reporting Period, the Department generated a list of incidents involving \nthe use of a Safety Chair, but the list did not include other Security Restraints used by the \nDepartment.  On March 28, 2018, the Department submitted a proposed revision to the \nDepartment's policy on Fixed Restraints\" (CDM 7-03/000.05), which will require that, \"no later \nthan twenty (20) minutes after the application of [a] fixed restraint, Department personnel shall \ninitiate documentation of the inmate's monitoring in the Fixed Restraint Log[.]\"  Once the \nproposed policy is implemented, the Department should be able to provide the Rosas Monitors \nwith a complete list of incidents involving the use of Security Restraints, from which the \nMonitors will select 25 incidents to review for compliance with these provisions.   \n \n  Section 17.10 provides that medication cannot be used solely for security purposes.  The \nDepartment's Self-Assessment, confirmed by a log of the Administration of Involuntary \nMedications, reports that there were no instances in which medication was used solely for \nsecurity purposes in the Third and Fourth Quarters of 2018.  Accordingly, the Department has \nbeen in Compliance with Section 17.10 as of July 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018.  \n \n7.  Early Warning System  \n \n  Section 19.1 requires the Department to develop an Early Warning System to identify \npotentially problematic employees based upon objective criteria.  The Panel met with the \nDepartment during the Fourth Reporting Period to review and discuss the Department's proposed \nERS.  The Panel approved the ERS in July 2018, and it was implemented by the Department as a \npilot program in the Downtown Jail Complex on August 1, 2018, and in the rest of the jail \nfacilities as of November 1, 2018.  The Department is in Compliance with Section 19.1 in the \nDowntown Jail Complex as of August 1, 2018.   \n \n  Section 19.2 requires Compliance Lieutenants to review monthly reports generated by the \nERS and notify Unit Commanders and the Assistant Sheriff for Custody of the results, and \nSection 19.3 requires Unit Commanders to determine whether problematic employees should be \nplaced on performance mentoring program.  Under the Revised Compliance Measures, \nCompliance Lieutenants must notify the Unit Commander and Assistant Sheriff for Custody \nOperations 90% of the time within 10 days after reviewing monthly reports generated by the \nEarly Warning System and 95% of the time within 30 days.  For each potentially problematic \nDepartment member identified through the Early Warning System, the Unit Commander must \nconsult with the appropriate Chief and document the reasons why any problematic members are \nnot placed on a performance mentoring program 95% of the time. \n \n  The Department's Self-Assessment reports that the Department achieved Compliance \nwith Section 19.2 in the Third Quarter of 2018 at all facilities in the Downtown Jail Complex, \nbut did not achieve Compliance in the Fourth Quarter of 2018 at MCJ or the Inmate Reception \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 25 of 28   Page ID\n #:4234\n \nCenter (\"IRC\").  Similarly, the Self-Assessment reports that the Department achieved \nCompliance with Section 19.3 in the Third Quarter of 2018 at all facilities, but not in the Fourth \nQuarter of 2018 at MCJ or IRC.     \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00428-DDP-MRW   Document 198   Filed 05/31/19   Page 26 of 28   Page ID\n #:4235\n \n          APPENDIX \n \nNO.
