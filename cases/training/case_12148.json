    "summary": "<p>On July 1, 2008, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act.  The plaintiffs asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief, specifically asking the release of certain records that had previously been requested. The case was assigned to Judge James Robertson.</p><p>News reports raised the possibility that law enforcement officers were, at least in some circumstances, obtaining cell phone tracking data directly from mobile carriers without obtaining warrants for probable cause from the court.  The plaintiffs claimed that on November 29, 2007, they filed FOIA requests with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (both part of the DOJ), asking for expedited processing and seeking records about the government's tracking of the location of individuals' mobile phones without first obtaining a warrant based on probable cause.  The requests sought all records about defendant's policies, procedures, and practices for obtaining mobile phone location information for law enforcement purposes.  They also sought all information on criminal prosecutions of particular individuals who were tracked using mobile phone location data where the government did not secure a prior warrant based on probable cause.  Nine months later, plaintiffs claim that defendant never gave them a complete response, failing to reply to administrative appeals, and that DOJ failed to release the records.</p><p>Plaintiffs sought an order for defendant to immediately process and provide all outstanding requested records; an injunction from defendant's charging plaintiffs processing fees; a declaratory judgment that the ACLU qualifies as a \"representative of the news media\" for purposes of fee assessments under the FOIA; and an award for plaintiffs' costs and attorneys' fees.</p><p>Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.  On March 26, 2010, the Court (Judge James Robertson) granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, as to the identified case names and docket numbers of criminal prosecutions of persons who have been convicted or have entered public guilty pleas.  The Court, however, denied the plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment as to the production of docket information in prosecutions of those who were acquitted or whose cases were dismissed or sealed, and denied their request for disclosure of case names in \"draft application\" and \"template application\" documents.  ACLU v. Dep't of Justice, 698 F. Supp. 2d 163 (D.D.C. 2010).</p><p>On September 6, 2011, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion.  ACLU v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 655 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The Court (in an opinion by Judge Merrick Garland) affirmed the district court's order requiring the disclosure of docket information from criminal cases in which the government prosecuted individuals after obtaining a warrant for cell phone data without showing probable cause, and where those individuals were ultimately convicted or entered public guilty pleas.  The Court, however, vacated the remainder of the district court's decision and remanded the case for further development of the record and reconsideration.  The Court noted that FOIA includes a strong presumption in favor of disclosure.  Here, the Court found that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the marginal privacy intrusion that may occur.  However, because the lower court drew a distinction between the permissible and impermissible documents in a way that neither side briefed, the case was remanded to develop the record further to see how many cases existed in the different categories and to gain more information about some of them.   The Court also noted that, at oral argument, defendant's counsel had suggested that defendant might be able to provide plaintiffs with the data they really want, rather than disclosing the individual documents.  The Court said that might be the basis for a settlement, but that the Court could not consider it because it was not raised in the appellate briefs nor in the district court proceedings.</p><p>The case proceeded after reassignment to Judge Jackson, and in April 2012 the defendant moved for summary judgment, which the Court eventually granted on February 15, 2013. The Court explained the case had been remanded solely for the purpose of determining whether withheld records were from cases that resulted in acquittal or that were dismissed or sealed.  923 F. Supp. 2d 310, 313. The Court's initial grant of summary judgment, that is, had not been overturned--or even criticized--in the appellate opinion. Id. at 314. Subsequent information provided by the defendant to the Court revealed the withheld records were from two cases that resulted in acquittal and four that resulted in dismissal. Id. at 313. These facts, the Court held, did not affect the initial grant of summary judgment, and thus it merited reaffirmation. Id. at 311.</p><p>Plaintiffs again appealed, arguing disclosure about criminal prosecution is not an invasion of privacy. Thus, plaintiffs contended, defendant could not have demonstrated such a disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and the district court had therefore erred in granting summary judgment. Oral argument was held February 20, 2014. On August 20, 2014, the Court of Appeals (Circuit Judges Kavanaugh, Tatel, and dissenting, Brown) affirmed the district court's judgment. The district court dismissed the case with prejudice on February 27, 2015. 700 F.3d 927. The case is now closed.</p>",

After the ACLU filed a lawsuit, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to both sides, demanding disclosure of some categories of documents and shielding other categories.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the part of the judgment which compelled disclosure and remanded the remainder of the opinion for further development of the record.  On remand, the Court reaffirmed its grant of summary judgment for the defendant, finding new information disclosed by the defendant did not affect the initial grant.  The plaintiffs again appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.",

As is relevant to this appeal, the plaintiffs requested \nrecords relating to: \n[I] The case name, docket number, and court of all \ncriminal prosecutions, current or past, of individuals \nwho were tracked using mobile location data, where \nthe government did not first secure a warrant based on \nprobable cause for such data, [and] \n[2]  Policies, procedures, and practices followed to \nobtain mobile phone location information  for  law \nenforcement purposes. \nApp.20,28. \n>when the government wants to track an individual's location \nthrough his or her cell phone, it submits an application to a judge \n(usually  a  magistrate  judge)  seeking  an  order  compelling  a \ntelecommunications company to provide access to the location data. \nThe plaintiffs contend that \"[p ]rosecutors appear to routinely take the \nview that the government can obtain cell site location information \nwithout a warrant, by simply presenting to a magistrate 'specific and \narticulable facts showing ... reasonable grounds to believe that ... the \nrecords or other information sought, are relevant and material to an \nongoing  criminal  investigation.'\"  ACLU  Br.  9  (quoting  In  re \nApplication of u.s. for an  Order for Disclosure of Telecomms. \nRecords & Authorizing Use ofP en Register & Trap & Trace, 405 F. \nSupp. 2d 435,444 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d»). \n\n4 \nOn July 1, 2008, the plaintiffs brought suit against the \nDepartment of Justice  (DOJ) to compel production of the \nrequested records.  See  FOrA,  5  U.S.C.  §  552(a)(4)(B). \nThereafter, the Department agreed to conduct a search for the \nrequested case names, docket numbers, and courts (\"docket \ninformation'').  It did this by first asking the relevant U.S. \nAttorneys' Offices to identify applications granted by judges (or \nmagistrate judges), on or after September 12,2001, to permit the \ngovernment  to  obtain  cell  phone  location  data  from \ntelecommunications companies, where the judge did not make \na determination of probable cause. It then asked those offices to \nprovide  the  docket  information for  any case in which an \nindividual was prosecuted after such an application was granted. \nThis inquiry generated a list of docket information for 255 \ncriminal prosecutions.  Def. 's Statement of Material Facts Not \nin Dispute at 3-4 (App. 37-38).  The Department then withheld \nthe list from disclosure,  asserting that it fell within FOlA \nExemptions 6 and 7(C).  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6), (7)(C).' \nThe Justice Department also produced a  Vaughn  index \ndescribing documents responsive to the plaintiffs' request for \n\"policies, procedures,  and practices,\" and invoking various \nFOlA exemptions to justify the redaction or withholding of \nsome of those documents. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, \n826-28 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  Among the documents listed in the \nVaughn index was a \"Draft Application\" to engage in cell phone \ntracking (Document 22), which the Department withheld in full, \n3A  lthough FOlA only requires a government agency to disclose \n\"agency records improperly withheld,\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), and \ndoes not \"impose[] [any] duty on the agency to create records,\" \nFor.ham v. Harris, 445 U.S. 169, 186 (1980), the Justice Department \ndid not resist compiling or disclosing the list on that ground --perhaps \nbecause it preferred producing the list (ifit came to that) to producing \nthe documents from which the list was created. \n\n5 \nand  a  \"Template Application\"  (Document  29),  which  the \nDepartment produced after redacting the docket number.  App. \n52, 54.  The plaintiffs objected to the withholding of the case \nname in Document 22, and of the docket numbers in both \n4 \nDocuments 22 and 29.\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In \nassessing the Justice Department's invocation of Exemptions 6 \nand 7(C), the district court began by \"allocat[ing] a greater \nprivacy interest to persons who were acquitted, or whose cases \nwere  dismissed or sealed  (and remain under  seal),  and a \nconsiderably  lesser privacy  interest  to  persons  who  were \nconvicted, or who entered public guilty pleas.\" ACLU v. Dep 'f \nofJ ustice, 698 F. Supp. 2d 163, 166 (D.D.C. 2010).  The court \nheld that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the privacy \ninterest in the second category but not in the first. Accordingly, \nthe court ordered the Department to release the requested docket \ninfonnation only in cases that ended in convictions or public \nguilty pleas. ld. \nWith respect to the two government applications for cell \nphone  data,  the  court  concluded that the  Department had \nproperly withheld the case name and docket numbers under \nExemption 7(C).  In light of the plaintiffs' concession that any \npersonally identifiable infonnation about surveillance targets \nwho had not yet been prosecuted could be redacted from the \ncase  name,  the  court  refused  to  order  the  ''meaningless \nproduction\" of a case name in which \"nothing would be left but \nvariants  of the  phrase  'In re:  Application  for  Cell  Site \n40ther documents listed in the index, or portions thereof, were \neither produced to the plaintiffs' satisfaction before the district court \nruled, see ACLU v. Dep't of Justice, 698 F. Supp. 2d 163, 165 n.1 \n(D.D.C. 2010), or are no longer at issue on this appeal, ACLU Br. 4 \nn.2, 30 n.21. \n\n6 \nAuthority. '\"  ld.  at  166-67.  The  court  also  rejected  the \nplaintiffs'  argument  that,  because  such  applications  are \ninvariably filed under seal, disclosure oft he applications' docket \nnumbers  would  not  reveal  any  personally  identifYing \ninfonnation.  The court found that disclosure \"could reveal \nsurveillance targets yet to be prosecuted, ... either because the \ncases are not actually sealed, or because the plaintiffs' promised \nmotion to unseal could be successful.\" ld. at 167. \nBoth parties appeal. The Justice Department challenges the \nportion of the district court's decision directing it to release \ndocket  information  in  prosecutions  of persons  who  were \nconvicted  or  entered  public  guilty  pleas.  The  plaintiffs \nchallenge the portion of the decision denying their request to \nrequire the production of docket information in prosecutions of \npersons who were acquitted, or whose cases were dismissed or \nsealed (and remain under seal). The plaintiffs also challenge the \ncourt's denial of their request to require disclosure of the case \nname in the \"Draft Application\" (Document 22), and the docket \nnumbers in both that document and the \"Template Application\" \n(Document 29). \nII \nWe review the district court's disposition on summary \njudgment de novo.  See Students Against Genocide v. Dep't of \nState, 257 F.3d 828, 833-34 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  \"In the FOIA \ncontext this requires that we ascertain whether the agency has \nsustained  its  burden  of demonstrating  that  the  documents \nrequested are ... exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\" \nGallant v. NLRB, 26 F.3d 168, 171  (D.C. Cir. 1994); see 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (stating that ''the burden is on the agency \nto sustain its action\"). \n\n7 \nFOIA was intended \"to pierce the veil of administrative \nsecrecy  and to  open agency  action to  the  light of public \nscrutiny.\"  Dep't of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 \n(1976) (intemal quotation marks omitted). \"Although Congress \nenumerated nine exemptions from the disclosure requirement, \n'these limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that \ndisclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.'\" \nNat'/ Ass 'n ofH  ome Builders v. Norton, 309 F.3d 26,32 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (quoting Rose, 425 U.S. at 361).  \"At all times[,l \ncourts  must bear in mind that  FOIA mandates  a  'strong \npresumption in favor of disclosure,'\" id. (quoting U.S. Dep 't of \nState v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173 (1991», \"and that the statutory \nexemptions,  which  are  exclusive,  are  to  be  'narrowly \nconstrued,'\" id.  (quoting Rose, 425 U.S.  at 361).  As the \nSupreme Court reminded appellate courts just this year, it has \n\"often noted the Act's goal of broad disclosure and insisted that \nthe exemptions be given a narrow compass.\" Milner v. Dep'l of \nthe Navy,  131  S.  Ct. 1259,  1265 (2011) (intemal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nFOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) seek to protect the privacy of \nindividuals  identified  in  certain  agency  records.  Under \nExemption 6, \"personnel and medical files and similar files\" \nmay be withheld if disclosure  \"would constitute  a  clearly \nunwarranted  invasion  of  personal  privacy.\"  5  U.S.C. \n§ 552(b)(6).  Under Exemption 7(C), \"records or information \ncompiled for law enforcement purposes\" may be withheld \"to \nthe extent that\" disclosure \"could reasonably be expected to \nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b) (7)(C). Although the Justice Department relied \non both exemptions in the district court, we need ouly consider \nwhether it properly invoked Exemption 7(C).  The plaintiffs \nconcede that the requested records are subject to that exemption \nbecause  they  are  \"records  compiled  for  law  enforcement \npurposes.\" See A CLU, 698 F. Supp. 2d at 165 n.2. And because \n\n8 \nExemption  7(C)  pennits  withholding  of  such  records  if \ndisclosure  would  constitute  an  ''unwarranted''  invasion  of \npersonal  privacy,  while  Exemption  6  requires  a  \"clearly \nunwarranted\" invasion to justify nondisclosure, \"Exemption \n7(C) is more protective of privacy than Exemption 6\" and thus \nestablishes a lower bar for withholding material.  U.S. Dep 't of \nDefense v. FLRA, 510 U.S. 487, 496 n.6 (1994); see also Nat 'I \nArchives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 165-66 \n(2003).' \nIn deciding whether the release of particular information \nconstitutes  an  ''unwarranted''  invasion  of privacy  under \nExemption  7(C),  we  \"must balance  the  public  interest  in \ndisclosure against the [privacy1  i nterest Congress intended the \nExemption to protect.\"  U.S.  Dep't of Justice v.  Reporters \nComm.for Freedom oft he Press, 489 U.S. 749, 776 (1989); see \nFavish, 541 U.S. at 171; Ray, 502 U.S. at 175 (quoting Rose, \n425 U.S. at 372).  The public interest that must be weighed in \nthis balance is the extent to which disclosure advances ''the basic \npurpose of the Freedom of Information Act 'to open agency \naction to the light of public scrutiny,'\" Reporters Comm., 489 \nU.S. at 772 (quoting Rose, 425 U.S. at 372), thereby furthering \n''the citizens' right to be informed about 'what their government \nis up to, '\" id. at 773. \nIn this Part, we examine the material the district court \nordered the Justice Department to disclose: docket information \n(case name, docket number, and court) from criminal cases in \nwhich  the  government prosecuted  individuals  after judges \n'As a consequence, we do not address the parties' dueling post \nargumentletters discussing the manner in which the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision in Milner, see 131 S. Ct at 1271, which narrowly \nconstrued the term ''personnel'' in FOIA Exemption 2, affects the \nproper construction ofFOIA Exemption 6. \n\n9 \ngranted applications for cell phone location data without a \ndetermination of probable cause, and in which those individuals \nwere subsequently convicted or entered public guilty pleas. In \nSubpart A we consider the privacy interest and in Subpart B the \npublic interest attendant to disclosure. In Part III, we consider \nthe  material  that  the  district  court  declined  to  order the \nDepartment to disclose. \nA \n1.  The first question we must ask is whether there is any \nprivacy interest at stake here.  In a given case, after all, the \ndisclosure of the docket number, case name, and court may \nalone reveal little or nothing about an individual:  the number \nand court plainly would not, and although the case name might \n(ifi t included more thanjust a relatively common last name), by \nitself it would disclose neither the charges nor the disposition. \nNonetheless, in evaluating the privacy impact of the release of \ninformation, the courts have taken into consideration potential \nderivative uses of that information.6  And here, it would take \n'SeeDep'tojDejensev.

CiT. \n1989); see also infra note 15. As we explained in NARFE v. Homer: \nIn virtually every case in which a privacy concern is \nimplicated,  someone  must  take  steps  after  the  initial \ndisclosure in order to briog about the untoward effect. \nDisclosure does not, literally by itself, constitute a harm; it \nis the requester's (or another's) reaction to the disclosure \nthat can stieg.  This is only more obvious where disclosure \nof the infonnation invades someone's privacy not because \nitis embarrassing but because it invites unwanted intrusions. \nWhere there is a substantial probability that disclosure will \n\n10 \nlittle work for an interested person to use the docket infonnation \non the government's list to look up the underlying case files in \nthe public records oft he courts, and therein find the infonnation \nof interest.  Although this can be done manually, it can also be \nreadily accomplished using the federal court system's own \npublic-access  database,  Public  Access  to  Court  Electronic \nRecords  (PACER),'  or private  databases  like  Westlaw  or \nLexisNexis.  Indeed, the plaintiffs have made clear that they \nintend to use the docket infonnation in this way. ACLU Reply \nBr.23-24. \nThere is also the question of just how much of a privacy \ninterest a defendant retains regarding the facts of his or her \nconviction or public gnilty plea.  We tend to agree with the \ndistrict court that the disclosure of convictions and public pleas \nis at the lower end oft he privacy spectrum. The parties agree as \nwell.  See ACLU Reply Br. 11; DOJ Br. 19.  This is not to say \nthat a convicted defendant has no privacy interest in the facts of \nhis conviction.  As the government points out, disclosure of a \ncriminal conviction may be \"embarrassing [and] stigmatizing,\" \nand may endanger one's prospects \"for successful reintegration \ninto the community.\"  DOJ Br. 20-21, 26.  But it is to say that \nthose interests are weaker than for individuals who have been \nacquitted or whose cases have been dismissed. Accord ACLU \nReply Br. 11; DOJ Br. 19.  And they are plainly substantially \ncause an interference with personal privacy, it matters not \nthat there may be two or three links in the causal chain. \n879 F.2d at 878. \n'PACER, provided by the federal judiciary, \"is an electronic \npublic access service that allows users to obtain case and docket \ninformation from  [all]  federal  appellate, district and bankruptcy \ncourts.\"  PACER:  Public  Access  to  Court Electronic  Records, \nhttp://www.pacer.gov. \n\n11 \nweaker than the privacy interests of individuals who have been \ninvestigated but never publicly charged at all.

Cir. 1981) (\"Typically, the decision not to \nprosecute insulates individuals who have been investigated but \nnot charged from th[ e1   rather significant intrusion into their \nlives\" occasioned by public indictment.).' \nNonetheless, there is no real dispute that the scope of \nExemption 7(C) can extend even to convictions and public \npleas. In U.S. Department ofJ ustice v. Reporters Committee for \nFreedom oft he Press, the Supreme Court held that release oft he \ncontents of an FBI ''rap sheet\" -- which may have included a \nrecord oft he subject's convictions --constituted an unwarranted \ninvasion of personal privacy under FOIA Exemption 7(C). See \n489 U.S. at 780.  The Court held \"as a categorical matter\" that \n\"a  third  party's  request  for  law  enforcement  records  or \ninfonnation about a private citizen can reasonably be expected \nto invade that citizen's privacy,\" and that such records may \n'The Justice Department correctly notes this court has held that \ndisclosure of records revealing that an individual was involved or \nmentioned in a law enforcement investigation implicates a significant \nprivacy interest. See Schrecker v. U.S. Dep '/ ofJ ustice, 349 F .3d 657, \n661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Safecard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d \n1197, 1205 (D.C. Cir. 1991); Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755,767 \n(D.C.

But in those cases, the subjects of the court's concem \nwere individuals who had never been charged, let alone convicted. \nMoreover, we again note that the question in this case is not whether \na convicted defendant has any privacy interests, but rather how much \nof an interest he has in the public-record facts of his conviction. \n\n12 \ntherefore not be disclosed in the absence of a cognizable public \ninterest.  ld.  As the docket numbers and case names the \nplaintiffs seek constitute \"law enforcement ... information\" that \nwill (through derivative use) identify private citizens who have \nbeen criminally prosecuted, disclosure implicates those citizens' \nprivacy interests. \n2.  The privacy interests at stake in this case, however, are \nconsiderably weaker than those at issue inReporters Committee. \nThe law enforcement records at issue there were rap sheets that \nrevealed the subjects' \"date ofb irth and physical characteristics, \nas  well  as  a  history  of arrests,  charges,  convictions,  and \nincarcerations\" in every jurisdiction in the country. 489 U.S. at \n752.  And they covered the subject's entire life:  the FBI \nnormally preserved a rap sheet until its subject turned eighty \nyears old. ld. \nHere, the information sought is quite different. As already \nnoted, the list alone contains little that is personal.  But even if \nthe  docket  information  is  used  to  find  the  underlying \nproceedings, for any particular individual it most likely would \nreveal only a single prosecution, rather than a comprehensive \nscorecard of the person's entire criminal history.'  It would \ndisclose only information conceruing a conviction or plea; it \nwould not disclose mere charges or arrests.  It would disclose \nonly information that has already been the subject of a public \nproceeding (either a trial or public guilty plea), rather than \nactions (like arrests) that may not have taken place in public. It \nwould disclose only information that is available in public \nrecords, which post-indictment filings always are and arrests \n'Disclosure would reveal more than one prosecution only ift here \nwere multiple prosecutions of the same individual among the 255 \nprosecutions listed. The Justice Department has not suggested that is \nthe case. \n\n13 \nmay not be.  Cf Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 754 n.2 (noting \ntbat in 47 states, ''nonconviction data cannot be disclosed at all \nfor non-criminal justice purposes, or may be disclosed only in \nnarrowly defined circumstances, for specified purposes\").10 \nFinally, the information at issue here is all less than (and \nprobably quite  a  bit less  tban)  ten years old,I I unlike the \nReporters Committee rap sheets tbat recorded a  lifetime of \neverytbing from major crimes to youthful indiscretions. \nThe fact that information about these proceedings is readily \navailable to the public reduces further still the incursion on \nprivacy resulting from disclosure. In Reporters Committee, the \n\"'The Justice Department insists  that these  distinctions  are \nirrelevant. After all, it notes, ''the infonnation that the Court held had \nbeen properly protected\" in Reporters Committee \"related to a single \nindividual, Charles Medico, who mayor may not have actually been \nprosecuted,\" and ''nowhere did the Court suggest that 'rap sheets' of \nindividuals who had only been prosecuted on one occasion could not \nbe withheld.\" DOJ Br. 24-25. But Reporters Committee considered \nrap sheets as \"a categorical matter\"  -- \"without regard to individual \ncircumstances\" --and barred disclosure in the absence ofa  cognizable \npublic interest because of''the practical obscurity\" of their contents. \n489 U.S. at 780.  As noted in Part II.A.3 below, the factors that \nrendered rap sheet information practically obscure do not apply to the \nindividual public prosecutions at issue in this case. \nliThe Justice Department compiled the list ofd ocket infonnation \nby asking U.S. Attorneys' Offices about applications for location data \nthat were granted after September 12, 2001.  Def.'s Statement of \nMaterial Facts Not in Dispute at 3 (App. 37); see Oral Arg. Recording \n23:48-24:04.  Since the docket information at issue here comes only \nfrom cases that subsequently led to indictments, and hence that had to \nhave been filed after that date, and then only when the indictments led \nto pleas or convictions, which had to have come later still, it is likely \nthat the infonnation at issue relates to cases that are substantially less \nthan ten years old. \n\n14 \nCourt recognized that \"the extent of the protection accorded a \nprivacy right at common law rested in part on the degree of \ndissemination  of  the  allegedly  private  fac!,\"  and  that \n\"information may be classified as 'private' if it is ... not freely \navailable to the public.\"  ld. at 763-64.  It further noted that, \nalthough \"one did not necessarily forfeit a privacy interest in \nmatters made part of the public record, ... the privacy interest \n[in such matters] was diminished.\"  ld. at 764 n.15; see id. \n(\"[Tlhe interests in privacyf ade when the information involved \nalready appears on the public record.\" (quoting Cox Broad. \nCorp. v.

Cir.  1997) (affirming \nagency's decision to release documents identifying individuals \nresponsible for regulatory violations because their Exemption 6 \nprivacy interests were '''minor' ... given that these individuals \nhave  been  identified  in  public  documents  filed  with  the \nCommission\"). \n3.  Of course, information that is technically public may be \n\"practical[ly] obscur[e].\"  Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 762, \n780 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Reporters Committee \nheld that, in such circumstances, an individual's privacy interest \nin limiting disclosure or dissemination of information does not \ndisappear just because it was once publicly released. ld. at 762-\n63, 780.  But unlike the rap sheet information in Reporters \nCommittee,  the  information at issue here is not practically \nobscure. \nIn Reporters Committee, the Court emphasized that there is \nan important \"distinction, in terms ofp ersonal privacy, between \nscattered disclosure oft he bits of information contained in a rap \nsheet and revelation of the rap sheet as a whole.\" ld. at 764; see \nUnited States v. Maynard, 615 F.3d 544,561 (D.C. Cir. 2010). \nIndeed, the Court noted that \"[t]he very fact that federal funds \nhave been spent to prepare . . . these criminal-history files \n\n15 \ndemonstrates that [even1  t he individual items of information in \nthe summaries would not otherwise be 'freely available' either \nto the officials who have access to the underlying files or to the \ngeneral public.\"  489 U.S. at 764.  What set rap sheets apart \nfrom other records implicating personal privacy, then, was ''the \ncompilation ofo therwise hard-to-obtain information,\" including \n\"information that would otherwise have surely been forgotten \nlong before a person attains age 80, when the FBI's rap sheets \nare discarded.\" ld. at 764,771. \"Plainly,\" the Court said, ''there \nis a vast difference between the public records that might be \nfound after a diligent search ofc ourthouse files, county archives, \nand  local  police  stations  throughout  the  country  and  a \ncomputerized sununary located in a single clearinghouse of \ninformation.\" ld. at 764.  This conclusion, the Court declared, \nwas  further  \"supported by the web of federal  [and  state1   \nstatutory and regulatory provisions that limit[] the disclosure of \nrap-sheet information.\" ld. at 764-65. \nIn this case, however, disclosure will reveal only the \"bits,\" \nnot the ''whole.'' At; already discussed, the most that disclosure \nis likely to lead to is the fact of a single conviction, not a \ncomprehensive scorecard of a person's entire criminal history \nacross multiple jurisdictions. Nor is there a web of statutory or \nregulatory  policies  obscuring  that  information,  nor  much \nexpense nor logistical difficulty in gathering it. To the contrary, \ncomputerized government services like PA  CERmake it possible \nto access court filings concerning any federal defendant from the \ncomfort of one's home or office, quite uulike the \"diligent \nsearch of courthouse files, county archives, and local police \nstations throughout the country\" that a citizen would have had \nto undertake to replicate the contents of a rap sheet, Reporters \nComm., 489 U.S. at 764.  In addition, newspapers regularly \nreport on federal prosecutions, and their accounts can easily be \nfound on the internet. Indeed, by routinely issuing press releases \nthat name the individuals that it has indicted, and then naming \n\n16 \nthem again when they plead guilty or are convicted, the Justice \nDepartment has itself made the process infinitely easier.!2  If \nsomeone wants to know whether his neighbor or potential \nemployee has been indicted for, convicted of, or pled guilty to \na federal offense, he may well  find out by simply entering a \nGoogle search for that person's name.13 Nor is there the kind of \ntemporal obscurity the Court found in Reporters Committee, \nwhere many of the incidents on the rap sheets, even if once \npublic,  ''would  otherwise  have  surely  been  forgotten.\" \nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 771.  As we have noted, the \nprosecutions  at issue  here  are  likely to have  taken  place \nconsiderably less than ten years ago. \nWe also disagree with the Department's suggestion that the \ndisclosures  sought  here  will  draw  renewed  attention  to \nindividuals in a way that the initial disclosures did not.  It is \nlittle more than speculation to suggest that friends or associates \nwho  did not learn of a  conviction at the time it occurred \n12The  Justice  Department  insists  that  \"the  fact  that  the \ngovernment voluntarily chooses to inform the  public  of certain \nprosecutorial activities that it deems newsworthy does not meao that \nit is insensitive to the FOIA privacy interests of the individuals it \nprosecutes.\"  DOJ Reply Br. 4.  But no  one is  questioning the \ngovernment's sensitivity. We point out the Department's press release \npractice not to pass judgment on it, but to show that it has further \ndiminished whatever practical obscurity there might have been with \nrespect to the names of indicted aod convicted individuals. \n13Google searches for variations of the phrase ''the United States \nAttorney. .. announced the indictment of,\" restricted to the last ten \nyears, yield thousaods of results.  The same is true of searches \nsubstituting \"conviction\" or \"guilty plea\" for ''indictment.'' A review \nof the first twenty pages of results for each such search shows that \nthey consist primarily of news reports or press releases that identify \nthe names aod charged offenses of indicted or convicted individuals. \n\n17 \n(whether through press accounts, press releases, or other means) \nwill hear of it for the first time merely because the Justice \nDepartment releases a list of docket numbers, courts, and case \nnames.  See Norton, 309 F.3d at 34-35 (discounting the import \nof an asserted interference with personal privacy because the \nagency failed to show that such interference \"[was] likely to \noccur\").  Such a list is surely less likely to draw attention to a \nname than was the initial press coverage of an indictment and \nconviction. Nor are we persuaded that, when a person has \nalready been publicly charged and convicted of a  federal \noffense, disclosure of that person's name on a list of persons \nwhose cell phones were tracked will materially increase the \nnumber of his or her possible future friends and associates who \nwill be exposed to the information.\" \nThe Justice Department maintains that the information the \nplaintiffs  seek  is  practically obscure  because  they  cannot \nidentify the prosecutions in which they are interested without the \ngovernment's assistance.  But all that is practically obscure is \ninformation regarding the government's policy --that is, which \nprosecutions involve the Department's use of warrantless cell \nphone tracking, and what the underlying records show about that \npolicy. What is not obscure is information that raises issues of \npersonal privacy  -- that is, the fact that particular individuals \nhave been convicted of or pled guilty to crimes.  Reporters \nCommittee was concerned solely about the latter; any interest in \nkeeping the government's own policies obscure runs directly \ncounter to FOIA's central purpose. \n14This is not to discount the possibility that a FOIA request might \nbe worded in such a way as to generate a list of convictions that, \nbecause ofp articularly stigmatic associations or otherwise, could draw \nspecial attention to the names on the list and so create heightened \nprivacy concerns.  But the government has made no such argument \nwith respect to the list of docket infonnation at issue in this case. \n\n18 \n4. Finally, the Department calls our attention to a derivative \nuse of the requested material that it regards as particularly \nharmful to privacy interests: the plaintiffs' suggestion that they \nmay contact convicted \"defendants and/or their counsel to \ndetermine whether [the1  d efendants ever learned that they were \nthe targets ofw  arrantless cell phone tracking.\" ACLUReply Br. \n24.  There is no doubt that the courts have held that the risk of \nunwanted contact following a FOlA disclosure is a privacy \ninterest that must be weighed in the privacy interest/public \ninterest balance.

Ray,  502 U.S.  at  175-77, offers  a \nparticularly inatructive comparison. In that case, the requesters sought \nthe government's unredacted sunnnaries ofi nterviews ofonsuccessful \nHaitian asylum seekers.  Those summaries contained not only the \ninterviewees'  names  and  addresses,  but  also  \"highly  personal \ninformation regarding marital and employment statos, children,living \nconditions and attempts to enter the Uuited States.\"  Id.  at 175. \n\n19 \ncourts found that the privacy impact outweighed the public \ninterest in disclosure because the public interest was either \nnegligible or non-existent.16 As we discuss in Subpart B below, \nthe public interest in disclosure is substantially higher in this \ncase and more than sufficient to tip the scales against the \nmarginal privacy intrusion that could occur. \n5. In sum, although the disclosure at issue here is sufficient \nto warrant consideration under Exemption 7(C) because it would \ncompromise more than a de minimis privacy interest, it would \nMoreover,  because the interviewees had \"left their homeland in \nviolation of Haitian law[,] ... the ptivacy interest in protecting these \nindividuals from any retaliatory action that ntight result from a \nrenewed interest in their aborted attempts to entigrate\" had to be \n\"given great weight.\"  Id.  at 176-77.  On these bases, the Court \nconcluded that \"disclosure of the interviewees' names would be a \nsignificant invasion of their ptivacy because it would subject them to \npossible  embarrassment  and  retaliatory  action,\"  and  that  the \nrequesters'  ''intent  to  interview  the  retomees  magnifie[d]  the \nimportance of maintaining the confidentiality of their identities.\" Id. \nat 177 & n.12. \n16Dep't ofD  efense v.

At most, it \nwill simply provide one more place in which a computerized \nsearch will find the same person's name and conviction -- and \neven that is only on the assumption that someone takes the \ndocket information from the list, looks up the underlying cases, \nand then puts that underlying information on the internet. \nB \nOn the other side oft he balance, we find a significant public \ninterest in disclosure, something altogether absent in Reporters \nCommittee.

As the plaintiffs note, with respect to wiretapping \nCongress has balanced privacy interests with law enforcement \nneeds by permitting the government to use that technique for \nonly the more serious offenses, see 18 U.S.C. § 2516, and the \nplaintiffs (and others) may decide to argue for similar legislation \nto govern cell phone tracking.  Disclosure would also provide \ninformation regarding how often prosecutions against people \nwho have been tracked are successful, thus shedding some light \non the efficacy of the technique and whether pursuing it is \nworthwhile in light of the privacy implications.  Information \nfrom suppression hearings in these cases could provide further \ninsight regarding the efficacy of the technique by revealing \nwhether courts  suppress  its  fruits,  and would disclose the \nstandard or standards the government uses to justify warrantless \ntracking.  Infonnation from suppression hearings would also \nprovide facts regarding the duration of tracking and the quality \nof tracking data, facts that would infonn the public discussion \nconcerning the intrusiveness of this investigative tool. \nThere are obviously many caveats about the value of the \ninfonnation that might be derived from the requested disclosure. \nFourth Amendment), and United States v.

And for a host of \nother reasons, the sample of prosecutions at issue here may be \nunrepresentative of the Justice Department's overall practice. \nBut the fact that the data will not be perfect does not mean that \nthere is no public interest in their disclosure. \nNor are we persuaded by the government's contention that \nthe  interest in informing the public  discussion is  deficient \nbecause the plaintiffs have insufficient evidence that disclosure \nwill show government wrongdoing. Whether the government's \ntracking  policy  is  legal  or illegal,  proper or improper,  is \nirrelevant to this case. It is true that, where \"the public interest \nbeing  asserted  is  to  show  that  responsible  officials  acted \nnegligently or otherwise improperly in the performance oft heir \nduties, the requester must establish more than a bare suspicion \nin order to obtain disclosure.\" Favish, 541 U.S. at 174. But the \nplaintiffs are not (or at least not only) seeking to show that the \ngovernment's tracking policy is legally improper,22 but rather to \nshow what that policy is and how effective or intrusive it is. \n\"[M]atters of substantive law enforcement policy . .  . are \nproperly the subject of public concern,\" whether or not the \npolicy in question is lawful. Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 766 \nn.l8. \nFinally,  the  Justice  Department  contends  that  the \nincremental contribution of disclosure to the public interest is \nnegligible \"given the extensive public attention that this issue is \nalready receiving.\"  DOJ Br. 32.  This is nothing more than a \nCatch-22  argument:  if public  attention were  not already \n\"That distinguishes this case from cases like our recent decision \nin Blackwell v. FBI, 2011 WL 2600831 (D.C. Cir. July I, 2011). \n\n25 \nfocused, the government would argue that shows there is no \npublic interest in disclosure; because there is public attention, it \nargues that no more is needed.23  But there is no doubt that much \nof the information the plaintiffs seek to develop from the FOIA \ndisclosure here --the connection between tracking applications \nand actual prosecutions --is not currently in the public domain. \nFor the reasons stated above, there is also no doubt that the \ninformation interested parties can derive from that connection \nwill yield further information about the government's policy that \nis not now readily available. The fact that the public already has \nsome information does not mean that more will not advance the \npublic interest. \n2. The Department protests that, because any benefit to the \npublic  interest  accrues  from  derivative  use  of the  docket \ninformation and not from that information itself, that benefit \ncannot be considered as part oft he public interest analysis. And \nit is true that the case names and docket numbers standing alone \ngenerate no public benefit; only through derivative uses can \ninformation valuable to the public be obtained.  But this court \ntakes derivative uses into account in evaluating the impact of \ndisclosure on the public interest,  just as both this court and the \n24 \n23See JOSEPH HELLER, CATCH-22, at 46 (paperback ed. 2004) \n(\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified \nthat a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were \nreal and immediate was the process of a rational mind.

But this \nis only half true.  In Ray, it was the government, not the Court, \nthat did the questioning: \"The Government,\" the Court reported, \n\"argues  that  we  should  adopt  a  categorical  rule  entirely \nexcluding  the  interest  in  such  use  from  the  process  of \nbalancing.\" 502 U.S. at 178.

In Getman v. NLRB, 450 F.2d 670 (D.C.

See Painting & Drywall \nWork Pres. Fund, 936 F.2d at 1303 (noting that \"a relevant public \ninterest could exist where 'the names ofc urrent workers might provide \nleads  for  an  investigative  reporter  seeking  to  ferret  out  what \ngovernment is up to,'\" but fmding that there was an alternative way to \nobtain the information and that FOIA disclosure did not offer a \nsignificant  enough  advantage  to  \"outweigh  the  ... workers' \nsignificant privacy interest\" (quoting FLRA v.

See Reporters \nComm., 489 U.S. at 771 (\"[T]he rights of the two press respondents in \nthis case are no different from those that might be asserted by any \nother third party, such as  a neighbor or prospective employer[, \nbecause,] [a]s we have repeatedly stated, Congress clearly intended the \nFOIA to give any member of the public as much right to disclosure as \none with a  special interest\"  in a particular document.

But the Department \nneglects to mention the remainder of Justice Scalia's analysis: \n\"[D]erivative use on the public-benefits side, and derivative use \non the personal-privacy side must surely go together.\" 502 U.S. \nat 181. \"[T]here is no plausible reason,\" he said, \"to allow it for \nthe one and bar itfor the other.\" ld. \nAccordingly, even under the authority the government cites, \nifw  e may not consider derivative use in determining the impact \nof disclosure on the public interest side, we also may not \nconsider  it in determining  disclosure's  impact  on privacy \ninterests. And without derivative use, the Department would fail \nto meet the threshold for invoking Exemption 7(C) at all. Ifwe \ndo not consider the possibility that the plaintiffs or others will \nfollow the path from the list of docket information to the \nunderlying court records, the ouly question left is whether there \nis any privacy interest in a list of docket numbers, case names, \nand courts. Oft hese , only uncommon names (e.g., United States \nv. Merrick Garland, rather than United States v. John Smith) \nwould  have  any  chance  at  all  of identifying  particular \nindividuals, and the district court could eliminate even that \npossibility by redacting the names.  That would stillieave the \nplaintiffs with all they need (the docket number and court) to \npursue their planned derivative use, but it would extinguish any \nprivacy interest. And if there is no privacy interest, Exemption \n7(C) simply does not apply.  Perhaps  for this reason, the \nDepartment acknowledged at oral argument that, ifw  e consider \nderivative use for evaluating privacy concerns, we must do the \nsame for the public interest. See Oral Arg. Recording 27: 16-:37. \nIn sum, because disclosure oft he information considered in \nthis Part would \"shed[] light on [the government's] performance \nof its  statutory  duties,\" it \"falls  squarely within  [FOIA's] \nstatutory purpose.\" Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 773. And in \nlight of the strength of the public interest in disclosure and the \n\n29 \nrelative weakness of the privacy interests at stake, we conclude \nthat production of the requested information will not constitute \nan \"unwarranted\" invasion ofp ersonal privacy under Exemption \n7(C). \nill \nIn this Part, we consider the plaintiffs' challenge to the \ndistrict court's refusal to direct the government to produce: (A) \nthe list of docket information for criminal cases in which the \ndefendants were acquitted, or for cases that were dismissed or \nsealed (and remain under seal); and (B) the case name in the \n\"Draft Application\" (Document 22), and the docket numbers in \nboth that document and the \"Template Application\" (Document \n29).  As  to  both,  we conclude that  a remand for  further \ndevelopment of the record is in order. \nA \nIn balancing the public and private interests implicated by \ndisclosure of the Department's list of docket information, the \ndistrict  court  found  dispositive  the  distinction  between \nindictments resulting in convictions or guilty pleas, and those \nresulting in acquittals or dismissals, or cases that remain sealed. \nAs we noted in Part II, this distinction makes some intuitive \nsense, as both parties agree that the disclosure of information \nregarding acquittals, dismissal of charges, or sealed cases raises \ngreater privacy concerns than the disclosure of information \nregarding public convictions or public pleas. See ACLU Reply \nBr. 11; DOJ Br. 19; Oral Arg. Recording 38:10 (agreement by \nplaintiffs' counsel that there is a distinction between the privacy \ninterest implicated by disclosure ofc onvictions and public guilty \npleas  and  that  implicated  by  disclosure  of acquittals  and \ndismissals).  But whether that is enough of a distinction to \n\n30 \njustify withholding under Exemption 7(C) is a harder question. \nIt is a question we need not answer today. \nThe plaintiffs acknowledge that: \nThis case is in an odd posture because neither party \nargued below that the district court should split the \ndifference by withholding some docket information \nand disclosing other docket information.  The district \ncourt sua sponte devised its distinction between cases \nending in conviction or guilty pleas and cases resulting \nin acquittal or dismissal or that remain sealed. \nACLU Reply Br. 3 n.3.  As a consequence, the record does not \nreveal whether there are any cases that fall  into the latter \ncategory. At oral argument, neither party could tell us whether \nthere are any, and the Justice Department acknowledged that it \nis possible there are none. See Oral Arg. Recording 22: 1O . \nRather than attempt to resolve a question that may turn out \nto be purely academic, we conclude that the better course is to \nvacate this portion oft he district court's decision and remand the \ncase for that court to determine whether any of the docket \nnumbers refer to cases in which the defendants were acquitted, \nor to cases that were dismissed or sealed (and remain sealed). \nThe court may develop this information by requiring affidavits \nof the government or additional entries in the government's \nVaughn  index.  See  Oral  Arg.  Recording  22:57 \n(acknowledgment by government counsel that the district court \nmay resolve the question by insisting on a more detailed Vaughn \nindex that would indicate the status of the cases).  Needless to \nsay, if there are no such cases, that will resolve this particular \nrequest. \n\n31 \nB \nThe plaintiffs also seek disclosure oft he docket number and \ncase name (with personally identifiable information redacted) of \none application to engage in warrantless cell phone tracking that \nthe government withheld in full (Document 22), and the docket \nnumber of another application that the government produced in \npartially redacted form (Document 29). The plaintiffs intend to \nuse this infonnation to locate the applications and the underlying \ncase files, and to move to unseal them if they are currently \nsealed.  ACLU Br. 32.  The district court was concerned that, \namong other things, this disclosure \"could reveal surveillance \ntargets yet to be prosecuted, ... either because the cases are not \nactually sealed, or because the plaintiffs' promised motion to \nunseal could be successful.\" ACLU, 698 F. Supp. 2d at 167. \nOnce again, the record is inadequate to resolve this issue. \nThe Vaughn  index labels the documents as, respectively, a \n\"Draft Application\"  and a  \"Template Application,\"  which \nsuggests they are internal drafts containing infonnation that may \nbe  covered  by  the  deliberative-process  or  work-product \nprivileges  cognizable under FOIA Exemption 5,  5  U.S.C. \n§ 552(b)(5).  See Rockwell Int'[ Corp. v. U.S. Dep't ofJ ustice, \n235 F.3d 598, 601  (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Indeed, although the \ndistrict  court  did  not  address  Exemption  5,  the  Justice \nDepartment asserted that exemption in the district court and \nmentions the exemption in its appellate brief.  See DOJ Br. 43 \nn.6.  The plaintiffs counter that the fact that each document \nbears a docket number \"suggest[s 1  t hat it was likely filed with a \ncourt,\" and hence does not constitute work product. ACLU Br. \n30. When asked at oral argument, however, Department counsel \nstated that the status of both documents is unclear, and that he \ndid not know whether either application was ever filed in court. \nSee Oral Arg. Recording 34:20-35:36. \n\n32 \nThe plaintiffs' appellate briefs do not argue for disclosure \nofd ocuments that are merely drafts or templates. They ask only \nfor  disclosure  of docket  information  in  \"cases  in  which \nprosecutors filed an application for warrantless  cell phone \nlocation  tracking.\"  ACLU  Br.  12  (emphasis  added). \nAccordingly, if neither Document 22 nor Document 29 fits that \ndescription, this issue, too, will resolve itself. \nBut even if the applications were filed, we do not know \nwhether they relate to pre-indictment investigations or to cases \nthat have already been indicted. Nor do we know whether, even \nift he latter, there are still ongoing investigations regarding other \ntargets oft he applications. Indeed, the district court worried that \ndisclosure could \"lead to release of personally identifiable \ninformation about surveillance targets who have yet to be \nprosecuted.\" ACLU, 698 F. Supp. 2d at 166. These distinctions \nmay be significant and may, depending on the facts, warrant \nwithholding  under  (inter  alia)  Exemption  7(A)  -- as  law \nenforcement records, the disclosure ofw  hich \"could reasonably \nbe expected to  interfere with enforcement proceedings,\"  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b )(7)(A). The government asserted this exemption \nin the district court as well. \nNor do we know whether, if filed, the applications are \ncurrently under seal. See ACLU Reply Br. 35 (\"Plaintiffs have \nno way of detennining whether the docket numbers correspond \nto sealed cases or whether the targets were indicted.\").  The \ndistrict court thought there was a possibility that \"the cases are \nnot actually sealed.\"  ACLU, 696 F. Supp. 2d at 167.27  This \nraises  still  further  problems,  including the  possibility that \nfollowing the docket information could lead the plaintiffs or \n27A  s we have noted, the district court was also concerned that, \neven if sealed, ''the ACLU's promised motion to uoseal could be \nsuccessful.\" ACLU, 698 F. Supp. 2d at 167. \n\n33 \nothers to applications that disclose not only the identities of \nconvicted defendants, but also of acquitted or uncharged third \nparties.  As we noted above, it is one thing to disclose the \nidentities of targets who were eventually convicted in public \nproceedings; but the privacy calculus becomes increasingly \nmore  significant  if disclosure  extends  to  those  who  were \nacquitted, or tu those whose activities were never the focus of \npublic  attention,  such  as  uncharged  investigative  subjects, \nwituesses, or bystanders.  Cf Favish, 541 U.S. at 166 (noting \nthat \"[t]here is special reason\" to protect data regarding \"persons \ninterviewed as witnesses or initial suspects\" as \"to which the \npublic does not have a general right of access in the ordinary \ncourse\"); Schrecker v. U.S. Dep't ofJ ustice, 349 F.3d 657, 666 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2003)  (holding  that  \"persons  involved  in  law \nenforcement investigations -- witnesses, informants, and the \ninvestigating agents --have a substantial interest in seeing that \ntheir participation remains secret\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted». \nIn their reply brief, the plaintiffs suggest that \"[i]f anything \nhinges on the characterization of the record, this Court shonld \nremand to  the  district  court  for  consideration  in the  first \ninstance.\" ACLU Reply Br. 35 n.12.  Because we think quite a \nlot may hinge on the record, we accept this suggestion. We will \nvacate and remand this portion oft he district court's decision as \nwell, and direct the court to determine the status of the two \nwithheld documents with respect to the distinctions described \nabove.  The court may develop this information by requiring \naffidavits of the government or additional entries in the Vaughn \nindex,  or  by  in  camera  examination  of the  underlying \ndocuments.  See Mays v. DEA, 234 F.3d 1324, 1328 (D.C. Cir. \n2000) (remanding where the Vaughn index was insufficient for \nthe court to tell \"whether and to what extent release of the \n'investigative details ' [to which the index] referred ... would \nreveal the identity or otherwise implicate the privacy interests of \n\n34 \nany third party,\" and noting that on remand ''the district court \nmay review the disputed documents in camera in order to make \nthis determination\"). \nIV \nOne final  note.  At oral argument, Justice Department \ncounsel suggested that, rather than producing the requested \ndocuments,  the  Department  might be  able  to  provide  the \nplaintiffs with more of the data they are really interested in \nwithout disclosing information that could intrude upon personal \nprivacy.  lIDs might include, counsel suggested, information \nsuch as the nature of the charges in all 255  cases on the \ngovernment's list, whether suppression motions were filed in \nthose cases, and the outcome of both the motions and the \nprosecutions. See Oral Arg. Recording 22: 15-:33; 29:46-31 :28. \nlIDs is an interesting offer, in part because it could require \nthe Department to provide certain information -- by using the \ndocket  information  and  PACER  to  find  the  underlying \ndocuments,  and  then  extracting  information  from  those \ndocuments  and  creating  a  summary document  -- that  the \nplaintiffs might not be able to obtain through a FOIA request. \nSee Forsham v. Harris, 445 U.S. 169, 186 (1980) (noting that \nFOIA does not \"impose[] [any] duty on the agency to create \nrecords\").  As such, it might provide the basis for a settlement \nof this case.  But it is not a suggestion that we can consider on \nthis appeal.  Among other things, it was raised neither in the \nDepartment's appellate briefs nor --to the best ofo ur knowledge \n-- in the district court proceedings. \nv \nWe affirm that portion of the district court's decision \ndirecting disclosure of docket information from criminal cases \n\n35 \nin which the government prosecuted individuals after judges \ngranted  applications  for  cell  phone  location  data  without \ndetermining probable cause, and in which those individuals were \nultimately convicted or entered public guilty pleas. We vacate \nand remand the remainder oft he district court's decision for that \ncourt to develop the factual information discussed in Part ill \nabove and, thereafter, to reconsider the appropriate disposition \nof the remaining aspects of the case. \nSo ordered.

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 \nU.S.c. § 552, and the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act,  28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 & \n2202, seeking the immediate processing and release of agency records requested by \nplaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union \nFoundation (collectively \"ACLU\") from defendant Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). \n2.  On November 29,2007, the ACLU filed FOIA requests (\"Requests\") \nwith the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and the Executive Office for \nUnited States Attorneys (\"EOUSA\"), which are part ofDOJ.  The ACLU asked for \nexpedited processing of its Requests, which sought records about the government's \ntracking of the location of individuals' mobile phones without first obtaining a \nwarrant based on probable cause.  Specifically, the Requests sought the release of all \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 15   Filed 09/19/08   Page 2 of 12\nrecords pertaining to defendant's policies, procedures and practices followed to \nobtain mobile phone location information for law enforcement purposes and, in \nparticular, information on criminal prosecutions of individuals who were tracked \nusing mobile phone location data where the government did not first secure a \nwarrant based on probable cause. \n3.  The ACLU submitted the Requests after court decisions and media \nreports revealed that defendant claims not to need probable cause to obtain real-time \ntracking information and that some EOUSA field offices were violating a DO] \n\"internal recommendation\" that \"federal prosecutors seek warrants based on \nprobable cause to obtain precise location data in private areas.\"] News reports raised \nthe possibility that on at least some occasions, law enforcement officers obtain \ntracking data directly from mobile carriers without any court involvement.  Media \nreports and court decisions indicated that the DEA has utilized cell phone location \ntracking on numerous occasions. \n4.  The information now in the public domain suggests that defendant may \nbe engaging in unauthorized and potentially unconstitutional tracking of individuals \nthrough their mobile phones.  Information pertaining to the DOl's procedures for \nobtaining real-time tracking information is vital to the public's understanding of the \nprivacy risks of carrying a mobile phone and of, more generally, the government's \nexpansive view of its surveillance powers.

Plaintiffs are entitled to a response to their Requests and to a timely \nrelease of the records sought.  DEA ignored the ACLU's request for expedited \nprocessing.  EOUSA declined to expedite the processing of plaintiffs' request. \nAlthough it has been nine months since the initial filing ofthe Requests, plaintiffs \nhave only received an incomplete response and defendant has failed to release the \nrecords requested. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n6.

Recent court decisions and media reports reveal that law enforcement \nofficers, frequently from the Drug Enforcement Administration, are routinely asking \ncourts to compel mobile carriers to provide them with information that enables them \nto locate individuals through their cell phones.  Ellen Nakashima, Cellp hone \nTracking Powers on Request, Washington Post, Page AOI, Nov. 23, 2007.  Known \nas real-time tracking, this procedure allows officials to home in on individuals by \ntracking their mobile phones, capable of pinpointing the target to within 30 feet.  Id. \nII.  Over the past few years, the government's tactics in obtaining real-time \ntracking information have garnered increasing attention.  Specifically, news \nreporters and legal experts have indicated growing concern that the government is \ncircumventing legal procedures for obtaining warrants based on probable cause \nwhen enlisting telephone companies to furnish information.2  On November 29, \n2 See, e.g., Brendan I.

Nonetheless, a growing number of reports reveal that the government \nclaims not to need probable cause to obtain real-time tracking information.  Publicly \navailable court decisions disclose that federal officials who do petition a court for an \norder are frequently using a standard lower than probable cause, replacing it with a \n\"reasonable relevance\" standard, which requires only a simple showing of \n\"articulable relevance to an ongoing investigation.\"  E.g., In Re Us. Order Dir. A \nProvo Of Elec. Commun., 534 F. Supp. 2d 585, 587 (W.O. Pa. 2008) (concluding that \nthe 'reasonable relevance' standard was unconstitutional and that officials must \nshow probable cause).4 \n14.  Information on government practices and procedures in obtaining real-\ntime tracking data is lacking.  It is not publicly known whether the government \nroutinely obtains mobile phone location information without any court supervision. \nYet, the implications for the public are vast: over 240 million Americans carry \nmobile phones and the number is steadily increasing.  CTTA-The Wireless \nAssociation-Survey Results June 2007, available at \nhttp://www.ctia.orglmedialpress/body.cfmlpridIl717. \n15.  The limited information currently available about the government's \ntracking practices raises serious questions about whether the government is \ncomplying with the law and the Constitution.  Several courts have held that the \ngovernment lacks authority to track individuals without first obtaining a warrant \nbased on probable cause.5 \n4 See also. e.g. Nakashima, supra note 1, at A01; Ramasastry, supra note 2, at I; Sovocool and Jamberdino, \nsupra note 2, at 2. \n6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 15   Filed 09/19/08   Page 7 of 12\n16.

On November 29,2007, the ACLU filed ForA requests with the DEA \nand the EOUSA seeking the release of records relating to government use of \ninformation from mobile carriers to track the location of individuals' mobile phones. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs sought records reflecting the policies, procedures and \npractices followed to obtain mobile phone location information for law enforcement \npurposes (\"Question 1\" ); the \"internal recommendation\" that \"federal prosecutors \nseek warrants based on probable cause to obtain precise location data in private \nareas,\" as described in the Washington Post article, supra, at AOI (\"Question 2\"); \nany violations of the \"internal recommendation\" (\"Question 3\"); the number of times \nthe government has applied for a court order, based on less than probable cause, \nauthorizing it to obtain mobile phone location information, and whether such \napplications were successful (\"Question 4\"); and records reflecting the case name, \ndocket number, and court of all criminal prosecutions, current or past, of individuals \nwho were tracked using mobile location data, where the government did not first \nu.s. \n5 See. e.g. In Re  Order Dir. A Provo Of Elec. Commun., 534 F. Supp. 2d 585, 587, (W.o. Pa 2008); In \nthe Matter oft he Application oft he UNITED STATES ofA  mericafor ORDERS A UTHORIZING the \nINSTALLATION and Use of PEN REGISTERS and Caller Identification Devices on Telephone Numbers \n[Sealed] and [Sealed], 416 F.

Md. 2006) (\"Unless and until Congress takes further \naction, the court may only authorize disclosure of prospective cell site information upon a showing of \nprobable cause pursuant to Rule 41.\"); In the Matter of an APPLICATION OF THE UNITED STATES FOR \nAN ORDER (I) A UTHORIZING THE USE OF A PEN REGISTER AND A TRAP AND TRACE DEVICE \nand (2) Authorizing Release ofS ubscriber Information and/or Cell Site I'lformation, 396 F.

In its request \n6 \nwith the EOUSA, the ACLU asked that 18 offices be searched\n18.  Plaintiffs requested expedited processing under the applicable provisions \nof the ForA and defendant DOJ's regulations.  They also sought both a limitation of \nprocessing fees as a \"representative of the news media\" and a waiver of all costs on \nthe grounds that disclosure of the requested information in this case would contribute \nto the public understanding of the privacy risks of carrying a mobile phone and of \nthe \"operations and activities ofthe government\" in tracking individuals through cell \nphones. \nAgency Responses \n19.  On May 30, 2008, plaintiffs received a letter from DEA denying their \nRequest.  On July 24, 2008, plaintiffs timely filed an administrative appeal. \nPlaintiffs have yet to receive a response.  DEA is in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), which requires that all agencies make a determination with \nrespect to any appeal within twenty days. \n20.  The EOUSA responded on December 7, 2007.  It denied the ACLU's \nrequest for expedited processing.  The letter stated that the agency had divided the \n7 \nRequest into 19 parts and that each of the 18 offices indicated by the ACLU were \ndirected to reply to Questions 2-4 of the Request.  A separate assignment number \nwas given to what the EOUSA called \"Third Party Tracking Cases,\" which dealt \n6 Office of Legal Programs, General Counsel's Office, Directors' Office, Southern District of California, \nNorthern District of California, Central District of California, Eastern District of California, the District of \nColumbia, Northern District oflndiana, Southern District oflndiana, Eastern District of Louisiana, Western \nDistrict of Louisiana, Middle District of Louisiana, District of New Jersey, Northern District of Florida, \nMiddle District of Florida, Southern District of Florida, and District of Nevada. \n7 Although the letter itself claims to divide the request into 16 parts, there are actually 19 parts, each given \nits own assignment number. \n8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 15   Filed 09/19/08   Page 9 of 12\nsolely with Question 5 of the FOIA request seeking records regarding criminal \nprosecutions. \n21.  By letter of December 12,2007, the EOUSA responded specifically to \nthe \"Third Party Tracking Cases\" request.  In the letter, the EOUSA declined to \nrespond to the question, claiming that, pursuant to EOUSA policy, the office could \nneither \"confirm nor deny that records concerning living third parties exist\" on the \ngrounds that the disclosure of such information would constitute an \"unwarranted \ninvasion of personal privacy.\"  On February 6,2008, the ACLU appealed this \ndecision but has yet to receive a response.  The EOUSA is in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(6)(A)(ii) requiring that all agencies make a determination with respect to \nany appeal within twenty days. \n22.  By letter of January 24, 2008, the EOUSA responded to the request \nassigned to the District of Nevada, 07-4136.  In the letter, the EOUSA denied the \nACLU's request for a fee reduction, determining that the ACLU did not meet the \nrequirements to be designated a \"media requester for FOIA fee purposes.\" It further \ndenied the request for a fee waiver, concluding that disclosure of the information \nrequested would not \"contribute significantly to public understanding ofthe \noperations and activities of the government.\"  Based on these conclusions, the \nEOUSA demanded an advance payment in order to continue processing the request \nfor the District of Nevada.  On March 12,2008, the ACLU appealed the EOUSA's \ndecision regarding request 07-4136, but has yet to receive a response. The EOUSA \nis in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii) requiring that all agencies make a \ndetermination with respect to any appeal within twenty days. \n9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 15   Filed 09/19/08   Page 10 of 12\n23.  Three offices-the Eastern District of Louisiana, Southern District of \nFlorida, and District of New Jersey-denied plaintiffs' Request, stating that they had \nno responsive records.  Plaintiffs timely filed administrative appeals, but received no \nresponses.  These components are in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), which \nrequires that all agencies make a determination with respect to any appeal within \ntwenty days. \n24.  As ofthe date that plaintiffs filed suit, five offices failed to respond to \n8 \nplaintiffs' request. \n25.  With regard to the five offices that did not respond by the time plaintiffs \nfiled suit (the Northern District of California, the Central District of California, the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Middle District of Louisiana and the Northern District of \nIndiana) and the six requests the denial of which the ACLU appealed (the DEA and, \nwith regard to EOUSA, Question 5, the District of Nevada, the Eastern District of \nLouisiana, the Southern District of Florida, and the District of New Jersey), \ndefendant is improperly withholding the records sought by plaintiffs' Request. \n26.  Nine offices denied plaintiffs' Request in whole or in part and plaintiffs \n9 \nchose not to appeal These requests are not before this Court. \nCause of Action \n27.  Defendant's failure to make promptly available the records sought by \nplaintiffs' Requests violates the ForA, 5 U.S.c. § 552(a)(3)(A), and defendant's \ncorresponding regulations. \n8 The Northern District of California, Central District of California, District of Columbia, the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana, and the Northern District of Indiana. \n9 These offices are the Office of Legal Programs, General Counsel's Office, Southern District of California, \nEastern District of California, Southern District oflndiana, Western District of Louisiana, the Director's \nOffice, the Northern District of Florida, and the Middle District of Florida. \n10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 15   Filed 09/19/08   Page 11 of 12\n28.

US.  Department of Justice,  655  F.3d  I \n(D.C. Cir. 201 I) (ACLU I), this court held that the Freedom of \nInformation Act required the Justice Department to disclose \ncase names and docket numbers for prosecutions in which the \ngovernment had obtained cellular phone tracking data without \na warrant and the defendant had ultimately been convicted. \nThe  court  left  open  the  question  whether  the  Department \nwould also have to  disclose  docket  information for  similar \nprosecutions in which the defendant had been acquitted or had \nthe charges dismissed. Now squarely facing just that question, \nwe  conclude  that  given  the  substantial  privacy  interest \nindividuals  have  in  controlling  information  concerning \ncriminal  charges  for  which  they  were  not  convicted,  the \nDepartment has properly withheld this information. \nI. \nIn  order to  \"open agency action  to  the  light of public \nscrutiny,\" Department of the Air Force v.  Rose, 425 U.S. 352, \n361 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted), FOIA requires \nfederal agencies, \"upon request, to make 'promptly available \nto  any  person'  any  'records'  so  long  as  the  request \n'reasonably describes such records,\"' Assassination Archives \n& Research Center v.  CIA, 334 F.3d 55, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2003) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)). This broad statutory mandate \nis  subject to  certain  enumerated  exemptions.  See  5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(b)(l)-(9).  At  issue  here  is  FOIA  Exemption  7(C), \nwhich  provides  that  an  agency  may  withhold  \"records  or \ninformation  compiled  for  law  enforcement  purposes\"  if \ndisclosure  \"could  reasonably  be  expected  to  constitute  an \nunwarranted  invasion of personal  privacy.\" Jd.  § 552(b)(7). \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 3 of 32\n3 \nDetermining whether an invasion of privacy is \"unwarranted\" \nwithin  the  meaning  of Exemption  7(C)  requires,  as  the \nSupreme  Court  held  in  US.  Department  of Justice  v. \nReporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, \n776  (1989),  \"balanc[ing]  the  public  interest  in  disclosure \nagainst  the  interest  [in  privacy]  Congress  intended  the \nExemption to protect.\" \nIn  Reporters Committee, the Supreme Court considered \nthe applicability of Exemption 7(C) to a request for an alleged \nmob figure's \"rap sheet\"-a document compiled by the FBI \nthat \"contain[ ed] certain descriptive information, such as date \nof birth and physical characteristics, as well as a history of \narrests, charges, convictions, and incarcerations.\" Id.  at 752. \nHolding that the disclosure of such rap sheets  implicates a \nsubstantial privacy interest, id. at 771, the Court rejected the \ncontention  that  any  interest  in  avoiding  disclosure \n\"approaches zero\" simply because \"events summarized in  a \nrap sheet have been previously disclosed to the public,\" id. at \n762-63. The Court explained that an individual's interest in \nprivacy  \"encompass[es]  the  individual's  control  of \ninformation concerning his or her person,\" id.  at 763, even \nthough \"the information may have been at one time public,\" \nid.  at 767.  Disclosure of a rap sheet, the Court found,  was \nparticularly  troubling  because  it  would  in  one  fell  swoop \nbring to light many facts about a person that might otherwise \nbe subject to little public scrutiny. See id.  at 769-71; see also \nid.  at 764 (emphasizing the \"distinction, in terms of personal \nprivacy,  between  scattered  disclosure  of  the  bits  of \ninformation contained in a rap sheet and revelation of the rap \nsheet as a whole\"). On the other side of the balance, the Court \nfound  the  public  interest  in  disclosure  to  be  fairly  limited \nbecause  a  rap  sheet  would  reveal  little  about  \"the \nGovernment's activities.\" !d. at 754. Thus, the Court held \"as \na categorical matter\" that granting a \"third party's request for \n\n' \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 4 of 32\n4 \nJaw  enforcement  records  or  information  about  a  private \ncitizen\"  that  \"seeks  no  'official  information'  about  a \nGovernment  agency'·  would  constitute  an  '\"unwarranted\"' \ninvasion ofprivacy.ld. at 780. \nThe case now before us arose after the  American Civil \nLiberties Union learned that federal law enforcement agencies \nwere,  without first  securing a warrant,  obtaining data from \ncellular phone companies that could be used to track phone \nusers' whereabouts. The ACLU filed FOlA requests with the \nDrug Enforcement Administration and the Executive Office \nfor  United  States  Attorneys,  seeking,  among  other  things, \nrecords related to: 'The case name, docket number, and court \nof all  criminal  prosecutions, current or past,  of individuals \nwho  were  tracked  using  mobile  location  data,  where  the \ngovernment did not first secure a warrant based on probable \ncause for such data.\" To compel production of these records, \nthe ACLU then sued the Department of Justice. \nIn response, the Department identified a large number of \nprosecutions-the total  count is  currently 229-in which  a \njudge had, since September 200 I, granted the government's \napplication to obtain cell phone location data without making \na probable cause determination. The Department refused to \ntum  this  list of cases over to  the  ACLU,  claiming that the \ninformation fell within FOIA Exemption 7(C). \nThe  parties  each  moved  for  summary judgment.  The \ndistrict court, then Judge Robertson, concluded that each of \nthe individuals who had been prosecuted in these cases had a \nprivacy  interest  in  preventing  disclosure  of the  requested \ninformation.  The  court  went  on  to  draw  a  distinction  that \nneither  party  had  directly  advanced,  according  \"a  greater \nprivacy  interest  to  persons  who  were  acquitted,  or whose \ncases were dismissed or sealed (and remain under seal), and a \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/1I: I 4   Page 5 of 32\n5 \nconsiderably  lesser  privacy  interest  to  persons  who  were \nconvicted,  or who  entered  public  guilty  pleas.\"  American \nCivil Liberties Union  v.  US.  Department of Justice,  698 F. \nSupp.  2d  163,  166  (D.D.C.  201 0).  Determining  that  \"the \npublic has a substantial interest in the subject of cell phone \ntracking\" that would be advanced by the requested disclosure, \nthe  court  held  that  \"the  public  interest  in  'what  the \ngovernment  is  up  to'  outweighs  the  privacy  interests  of \npersons who have been convicted of crimes or have entered \npublic guilty pleas; but ... the privacy interests of persons \nwho have been acquitted, or whose cases have been  sealed \nand remain under seal, or whose charges have been dismissed, \noutweigh the public interest in disclosure of their names and \ncase numbers.\" !d.  The  district court therefore  directed  the \nDepartment to  disclose  the  requested  information  regarding \nprosecutions  in  which  the  government  had  secured  a \nconviction  but  permitted  it  to  withhold  the  information \nregarding the remaining cases. \nBoth sides appealed, and this court affirmed in part. We \nbegan our analysis by noting that, although the ACLU sought \nonly  the  case  name,  court,  and  docket  number  of these \nprosecutions,  courts  \"evaluating  the  privacy  impact  of the \nrelease  of information  .  .  . have  taken  into  consideration \npotential derivative uses of that information.\" ACLU I,  655 \nF .3d at 7. The derivative uses to be made with the requested \ndocket information were fairly substantial: with \"little work,\" \nsomeone could \"look up the underlying case files in the public \nrecords of the courts,\" id., and could even attempt to contact \nthe  defendants,  or  their  attorneys,  directly,  id.  at  11-12. \nNevertheless,  we  concluded  that,  with  respect  to  those \ndefendants  who  had  ultimately  been  convicted,  disclosure \n\"would compromise more than a de minimis privacy interest, \n[but]  it would not compromise much  more.\" /d.  at  12.  We \nemphasized  that,  unlike  in  Reporters  Committee,  the \n\nr: \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 6 of 32\n6 \nrequested  infonnation pertained only  to  a single,  relatively \nrecent prosecution, the details of which were already \"readily \navailable  to  the  public\"  and  not  at  all  '\"practical[ly] \nobscure[].\"' Jd.  at 9 (quoting Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. \nat 762) (alteration in original). As for the public interest, we \ndetennined that disclosure would have the significant benefit \nof \"shedding  light  on  the  scope  and  effectiveness  of cell \nphone tracking as a law enforcement tool,\" helping to \"inform \n[the]  ongoing  public  policy  discussion\"  regarding  the \npropriety of warrantless cell  phone tracking. Jd.  at 13. \"[I]n \nlight  of the  strength  of [this]  public  interest  ... and  the \nrelative weakness of the privacy interests at stake,\" we held \nthat the district court had correctly rejected the Department's \ncontention that production of this docket infonnation would \nrepresent  an  '\"unwarranted'  invasion  of  privacy  under \nExemption 7(C).\" ld. at 16. \nSignificantly,  however,  we  did  not  affinn  the  district \ncourt's  holding  that  infonnation  regarding  acquittals, \ndismissals, or sealed cases could be withheld. We did observe \nthat the distinction the district court had drawn \"makes some \nintuitive sense,  as  both  parties agree that the  disclosure  of \ninfonnation  regarding  [such  cases]  raises  greater  privacy \nconcerns than the disclosure of infonnation regarding public \nconvictions or public pleas.\" Id.  at  17.  But,  we  continued, \n\"whether that is enough of a distinction to justify withholding \nunder Exemption 7(C) is a harder question.\" I d.  Because it \nwas unclear from the record whether there were any cases that \nfell  within  this  category,  we  opted  to  forgo  resolving  the \nissue,  instead  vacating  this  portion  of the  district  court's \ndecision  and  \"remand[ing]  the  case  for  th[ e]  court  to \ndetermine whether any of the docket numbers refer to cases in \nwhich the defendants were acquitted, or to  cases that were \ndismissed or sealed.\" Id. \n\nI,\",  \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 7 of 32\n7 \nFollowing  our  remand,  the  Department  identified  214 \nprosecutions that had resulted in convictions or public guilty \npleas and released the docket information for these cases. This \nleft a total of fifteen prosecutions that were responsive to the \nACLU's request and had ended in dismissals or acquittals, or \nhad  been sealed.  Because the ACLU  did  not challenge the \nDepartment's authority to withhold the information regarding \nsealed cases, only six remain at issue~four of which were \nresolved  by  dismissal  and  two  that  ended  in  acquittal. \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v.  US. Department ofJ ustice, \n923 F. Supp. 2d 310, 313 (D.D.C. 2013). Having established \nthat  these  six  cases  in  fact  existed,  Judge  Amy  Berman \nJackson,  to  whom  the  case  was  assigned  after  Judge \nRobertson's  retirement,  again  granted  the  Department's \nmotion for summary judgment. !d. at 314. \nThe ACLU appeals, thus presenting us with the \"harder \nquestion\"  we  were  previously able  to  avoid. ACLU I,  655 \nF.3d at 17. Our review is de novo. \"In the FOIA context this \nrequires that we ascertain whether the agency has sustained its \nburden of demonstrating that the documents requested are ... \nexempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\" !d.  at 5 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nII. \nAs  in our previous decision, we begin by assessing the \nprivacy  interest  at  stake.  The  Department  argues  that \n\"prosecuted-but-not-convicted individuals are ... in a similar \nposition  to  persons  investigated  or  arrested  but  not \nprosecuted,\"  and  that  this  court  has  \"accord[ ed]  a  strong \nprivacy interest to such individuals.\" Appellee's Br.  19. The \nACLU argues that the privacy interests of defendants whose \nprosecutions  resulted  in  dismissals  or  acquittals  are  only \n\"marginally  greater\"  than  those  of defendants  who  were \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 8 of 32\n8 \nconvicted-which, as we held in our prior decision, are nearly \nde minimis. Appellants' Br. 20. Each party overstates its case. \nIt  is  true,  as  the  Department  observes,  that  we  have \nregularly concluded that individuals have a \"strong interest\" \nin  avoiding  disclosure  of  their  involvement  in  \"alleged \ncriminal activity.\" Filzgibbon v. CIA, 911  F.2d 755, 767 (D.C. \nCir.  1990) (internal  quotation marks omitted); accord,  e.g., \nPeople for  the  Ethical  Treatment  of Animals  v.  National \nInstitute of Health, No. 12-5183, slip op. at 9 (D.C. Cir. Mar. \n14, 2014 );  Fund for Constitutional Government v.  National \nArchives &  Records Service,  656 F.2d 856,  866  (D.C.  Cir. \n1981 ). Those decisions, however, dealt with individuals who \nwere  either  the  subject  of  or  involved  in  government \ninvestigations of criminal activity but never charged with a \ncrime.  See  ACLU I,  655  F.3d  at  7  n.8.  Such  individuals' \nprivacy interests are strong in part because disclosure would \n\"reveal[] to the public that the individual had been the subject \nof an ... investigation.\" Baez v.  US.  Department of Justice, \n647  F.2d  1328,  1338  (D.C.  Cir.  1980)  (emphasis  added); \naccord,  e.g., Branch v.  FBI, 658 F.  Supp. 204, 209 (D.D.C. \n1987).  The  privacy  interest  in  preventing  disclosure  is \ndiminished, however, if the fact of someone's involvement in \nalleged criminal activity is already a matter of public record \nas  will  be  the  case  when  a  defendant  was  indicted.  See \nReporters Commil/ee, 489 U.S. at 763; ACLU I, 655 F.3d at 7 \n& n.8. Thus, we disagree with the Department that those who \nhave been acquitted or had their cases dismissed and whose \ninvolvement  in  alleged  criminal  activity  has  already  been \npublicly revealed are in the same situation as those who were \nnever charged in the first place. \nWe  likewise  disagree  with  the  ACLU that the  privacy \ninterests of defendants who were indicted but not convicted \nare essentially indistinguishable from those of defendants who \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 9 of 32\n9 \nwere  convicted.  To  be  sure,  many  of  the  factors  we \nconsidered important in concluding that convicted defendants \nhave a relatively weak privacy interest are equally applicable \nto those individuals whose interests we now consider here. In \nparticular,  just  as  was  true  with  respect  to  convicted \ndefendants,  the  requested  docket  information  regarding \ndefendants  who  were  charged  but  not  convicted  would \n\"disclose only information that has already been the subject of \na public proceeding,\" is \"available in public records,\" ACLU \nI, 655 F.3d at 8, and is likely readily accessible by the public \nthrough \"computerized government services like PACER\" or \neven a simple \"Google search for that person's name,\" id.  at \nI 0. Indeed, as we have observed, this prior public exposure is \nprecisely what distinguishes the  individuals whose  interests \nwe  consider  in  this  case  from  those  who  have  been \ninvestigated  but not  charged.  But the  fact  that  information \nabout these  individuals'  cases  is  a matter of public  record \nsimply  makes  their  privacy  interests  \"fade,\"  not disappear \naltogether. ACLU I,  655 F.3d at 9 (internal quotation marks \nomitted); see Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.  Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, \n494--95  (1975)  (\"[T]he  interests  in  privacy  fade  when  the \ninformation involved already appears on the public record.\"); \nsee Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. at 767 (\"[O)ur cases have \n.  .  .  recognized  the  privacy  interest  inherent  in  the \nnondisclosure  of  certain  information  even  where  the \ninformation may have been at one time public.\"). Consistent \nwith our decision in ACLU I, we reject the dissent's surrender \nof any reasonable expectation of privacy to the  Internet--a \nsurrender  that  would  appear  to  result  from  a  failure  to \ndistinguish between the mere ability to access information and \nthe likelihood of actual public focus on that information. See \nDissenting Op. at 4-6; cf United States v.  Jones,  132 S. Ct. \n945,  964  (20!2)  (Alita,  J.,  concurring)  (concluding  that \nindividuals generally have a reasonable expectation in  being \nfree of long-term GPS surveillance notwithstanding the ready \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 10 of 32\n10 \navailability of this  technology);  id.  at  957  (Sotomayor,  J., \nconcurring)  (suggesting  that  \"it  may  be  necessary  to \nreconsider the premise that an  individual has no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to \nthird parties,\"  as  that \"approach  is  ill  suited  to  the  digital \nage\"). And if individuals not convicted have a substantially \ngreater  privacy  interest  than  convicted  individuals  to  start \nwith, then even after both interests are discounted due to prior \npublic revelation, the former interest will remain substantially \ngreater than the latter. \nIn  our  view,  defendants  whose  prosecutions  ended  in \nacquittal or dismissal have a much stronger privacy interest in \ncontrolling  information  concerning  those  prosecutions  than \ndefendants who were ultimately convicted. The presumption \nof innocence stands as one of the most fundamental principles \nof our system of criminal justice: defendants are considered \ninnocent unless and  until the prosecution  proves their guilt \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See Coffin v.  United States,  156 \nU.S.  432,  453  (1895)  (\"The  principle  that  there  is  a \npresumption  of innocence  in  favor  of the  accused  is  the \nundoubted  law,  axiomatic  and  elementary,  and  its \nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our \ncriminal law.\"). Individuals who are charged with a crime and \nultimately prevail of course remain entitled to a version of this \npresumption. In the eyes of the law, they are not guilty. Cf \nHerrera v.  Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 399--400 (1993) (following \nconviction, \"the presumption of innocence disappears,\" and \n\"(t]hus, in the eyes of the law, petitioner does not come before \nthe Court as  one who  is  'innocent\"').  Unfortunately, public \nperceptions can be quite different. Aware of the heavy burden \nof proof that  the  government  must  satisfy  in  a  criminal \nprosecution, many may well assume that individuals charged \nwith a crime likely committed that crime regardless of how \nthe  case  was  ultimately  resolved.  \"We  all  know,\"  ACLU \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 11 of 32\n11 \ncounsel candidly observed at oral argument, \"there are some \nguilty people who are not convicted.'' Oral Arg. Rec. 27:03-\n:08.  Or  as  former  Secretary  of Labor  Raymond  Donovan \nwondered after being acquitted of larceny and fraud, \"Which \noffice do  1 go to to get my reputation back?\" Selwyn Raab, \nDonovan Cleared of Fraud Charges by Jury in Bronx, N.Y. \nTimes, May 26, 1987, at AI. Thus, if the right to privacy is, at \nits essence, \"the right to be  let alone,\" Olmstead v.  United \nStates,  277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J.,  dissenting), \nthose who are acquitted or whose charges are dismissed have \nan especially strong interest in being let alone. Although the \nfact  that such defendants were accused of criminal conduct \nmay remain a matter of public record, they  are  entitled to \nmove on with their lives without having the public reminded \nof their alleged but never proven transgressions. \nThis special interest in shielding those charged with but \nnot convicted of a crime is reflected in state Jaws that limit the \ndisclosure of criminal history summaries involving data other \nthan  convictions.  See,  e.g.,  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  §  54-142n \n(\"Nonconviction  information  other  than  erased  information \nmay be disclosed only to: (I) Criminal justice agencies ... ; \n(2) agencies and persons which require such  information to \nimplement a statute or executive order that expressly refers to \ncriminal  conduct;  (3)  agencies  or  persons  authorized  by  a \ncourt  order,  statute  or  decisional  law  to  receive  criminal \nhistory  record  information.\");  Haw.  Rev.  Stat.  §  846-9 \n(providing that \"[d]issemination of nonconviction data shall \nbe  limited\"  to  certain  specified  entities,  but  that  \"[t]hese \ndissemination limitations do  not apply to  conviction data\"); \nsee also Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. at 754 n.2 (observing \nthat  \"[i]n  general,  conviction  data  is  far  more  available \noutside  the  criminal  justice  system  than  is  nonconviction \ndata,\"  and that  in  \"4 7 states  nonconviction  data cannot be \ndisclosed at all for non-criminal justice purposes, or may be \n\nu: \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 12 of 32\n12 \ndisclosed only  in  narrowly defined circumstances\" (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). It is also reflected in statutes and \ncourt decisions providing for the sealing of cases in which the \ndefendant was  never convicted.  See.  e.g., N.Y.  Crim. Proc. \nLaw § 160.50 (\"Upon the termination of a criminal action or \nproceeding against a person  in  favor of such person  . . . , \nunless ... the court ... determines that the interests ofj ustice \nrequire otherwise ... , the record of such action or proceeding \nshall  be  sealed  ....\" ); Ohio  Rev.  Code  § 2953.52 (\"Any \nperson, who is found not guilty of an offense by a jury or a \ncourt  or  who  is  the  defendant  named  in  a  dismissed \ncomplaint, indictment, or information, may apply to the court \nfor an order to seal the person's official records in the case.\"); \nsee also John P. Sellers, Ill, Sealed with an Acquittal: When \nNot Guilty Means Never Having to Say You  Were  Tried, 32 \nCap. U. L. Rev.  I (2003) (describing Ohio courts' expansive \nuse of this power). Perhaps most important for our purposes, \nit is an interest whose relative significance is reflected in our \nprior decision  in  this  case,  in  which  we  observed that the \nprivacy interests of defendants who have been convicted \"are \nweaker  than  for  individuals  who  have  been  acquitted  or \nwhose cases have been dismissed.\" ACLU I,  655  F.3d at 7; \nsee  also  id.  at  8  (emphasizing  that,  unlike  in  Reporters \nCommittee,  the  requested  disclosure  would  \"disclose  only \ninformation  concerning  a conviction or plea;  it  would  not \ndisclose mere charges or arrests''). Indeed, even our dissenting \ncolleague appears to acknowledge the relative strength of this \ninterest.  See  Dissenting  Op.  at 2  (stating  that  the  privacy \ninterests here are \"marginally greater than they were in ACLU \nf'). \nRelease of the docket information the ACLU seeks would \nsubstantially infringe this privacy interest. It would create the \nrisk-perhaps  small,  see ACLU I,  655  F.3d  at  lO-ll, but \nnonetheless real-that renewed attention would be paid to the \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 13 of 32\n13 \nindividuals who were the subject of these prosecutions. While \nthis  attention  would  have  been  warranted  at  the  time  of \nindictment, now that these defendants have been acquitted or \nhad the relevant charges dismissed they have a significant and \njustified  interest  in  avoiding  additional  and  unnecessary \npublicity. For example, someone who had been acquitted of \naccounting fraud after a full and fair trial, moved on with his \nlife, and started a family might be especially dismayed were \nhis neighbors, friends, and family to learn about his previous \nprosecution due to the publicity associated with the release of \nthe  requested  information.  Or what of a defendant  charged \nwith producing child pornography whose case was dismissed \nafter the  government  identified  the  real  perpetrator,  yet  is \nnevertheless viewed with suspicion by those who learn of his \nmere involvement in such a case? If,  as the Supreme Court \nput it  in  Reporters Committee,  an  \"ordinary citizen\" has  a \nprivacy interest \"in the aspects of his or her criminal history \nthat may have been wholly forgotten,\" certainly that interest is \nparticularly great when the ordinary citizen was never actually \nconvicted but nonetheless might be presumed by the public to \nhave been guilty. 489 U.S. at 769. Release of this information \nwould  also  permit  the  ACLU  or  others  to  contact  the \ndefendants  in  question  in  order  to  learn  more  about  their \ncases, something the ACLU has expressly told us it plans to \ndo.  Though \"relatively minimal,\" ACLU I,  655  F.3d at  II, \nsuch  an  intrusion  may  be  especially  undesirable  for \nindividuals who are  understandably trying to  put their past \nensnarement in the criminal justice system behind them. \nIII. \nHaving concluded that defendants who were acquitted or \nhad their cases dismissed have a substantial privacy interest at \nstake, we must now balance this  interest against the  public \ninterest  in  disclosure.  Such  balancing  decisions,  generally \nspeaking, are among the most challenging sorts of cases that \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 14 of 32\n14 \njudges face.  Indeed,  the  task  brings  to  mind the  rhetorical \nquestion  often  attributed  to  Chief Justice  Traynor  of the \nCalifornia  Supreme  Court:  \"Can  you  weigh  a  bushel  of \nhorsefeathers against next Thursday?\" Brainerd Currie,  The \nDisinterested Third State,  28  Law &  Contemp. Probs.  754, \n754 ( 1963); cj also  William  Prosser, Res Ipsa Loquitur in \nCalifornia, 37 Cal. L. Rev. 183, 225 (1949) (\"A presumption \n... can no more be balanced against evidence than ten pounds \nof  sugar  can  be  weighed  against  half-past  two  in  the \nafternoon.\") (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case, \nhowever,  the  comparison  is  not  so  amorphous  and  the \nbalance, while close, is nonetheless clear. \nThe  ACLU  argues  that  because  warrantless  cellphone \ntracking remains an issue of great public concern, the public \ninterest in disclosure is the same as  it was the  last time this \ncase was before us.  According to the Department, however, \nthe public interest in the disclosure of these six prosecutions is \nreduced by the prior disclosure of the 214 prosecutions that \nresulted in convictions. In support, the Department relies on \nSchrecker v.  US.  Department of Justice, 349 F.3d 657 (D.C. \nCir. 2003), in which we observed that a court's \"inquiry'\" into \nthe  interest  in  disclosure  \"should  focus  not on  the general \npublic interest in the subject matter of the FOIA request, but \nrather on  the  incremental value of the specific information \nbeing withheld.\" !d. at 661 (emphasis added). \nWe  have  no  need  to  wade  into  this  debate.  Even \nassuming, as the ACLU contends, that the public interest in \nthe disclosure here equals that in ACLU !, that interest pales in \ncomparison to the substantial interests in privacy that are now \nat  stake.  The  line  drawn  by  Judge  Robertson  between \nprosecutions that result in convictions and those that result in \ndismissals  or  acquittals  is  not just one  that  \"makes  some \nintuitive sense,\" as  we put it in our prior opinion;  it is,  we \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 15 of 32\n15 \nnow hold,  a distinction  that  is  fully  consistent with  FOIA. \nGiven  the  fundamental  interest  individuals  who  have  been \ncharged  with  but  never  convicted  of  a  crime  have  in \npreventing  the  repeated  disclosure  of  the  fact  of  their \nprosecution,  we  have  little  hesitation  in  concluding  that \nrelease of the remaining information the ACLU seeks \"'could \nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion \nof personal  privacy.'\"  5  U.S.C.  § 552(b)(7)(C).  Indeed,  the \ngovernment, having brought the full force of its prosecutorial \npower to bear against individuals it ultimately failed to prove \nactually  committed  crimes,  has  a  special  responsibility-a \nresponsibility it is fulfilling here-to protect such individuals \nfrom further public scrutiny. \nIV. \nOne last issue demands our attention. The ACLU argues \nthat neither this  court nor  the district court could  properly \nconclude that the  Exemption 7(C) balance  tilts  in  favor  of \nwithholding because the Department has failed to provide the \ninformation necessary to make that determination. The ACLU \nlists seventeen facts the Department has refused to provide \nfacts  relating to  the  specifics of the  litigation  in  these  six \ncases,  the  particular defendants  charged,  and  the  degree  to \nwhich the cases received prior publicity. This information, it \nclaims,  might either increase the  public  benefit that  would \nflow from disclosure of this particular docket information or \ndecrease the privacy interest at stake. To the extent they are \nrelevant at all, however, sixteen of the seventeen specifics the \nACLU  contends the  Department  should  have  produced are \nfacts for which the burden of production actually lies with the \nACLU. See National Archives &  Records Administration v. \nFavish,  541  U.S.  157,  172  (2004)  ('\"Where  the  privacy \nconcerns  addressed  by  Exemption  7(C)  are  present,  the \nexemption requires the person requesting the information to \nestablish  a sufficient reason  for  the disclosure.\"); Afshar v. \n\n~- II \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 16 of 32\n16 \nDepartment of State, 702 F.2d  1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir.  1983) \n(\"'[A] plaintiff asserting a claim of prior disclosure must bear \nthe initial  burden of pointing to  specific information in the \npublic domain that appears to duplicate that being withheld.\"). \nThe one piece of information requested by the ACLU that \nthe government would have to produce is whether any of the \ndefendants  have  died.  As  we  have  held,  not  only  is  an \nindividual's death \"a relevant factor\" in assessing the privacy \ninterests implicated by a disclosure involving that individual, \nbut in some circumstances the government must take \"certain \nbasic  steps to  ascertain  whether  an  individual  [is]  dead  or \nalive.\" Schrecker v.  U.S. Department ofJ ustice, 254 F.3d 162, \n166--67 (D.C. Cir. 2001). But although death may \"diminish\" \nthe relevant privacy interests, it \"by no  means extinguishes\" \nthem  because  \"one's own  and  one's  relations'  interests  in \nprivacy ordinarily extend beyond one's death.'' Id at 166; see \nalso Swidler &  Berlin v.  United States,  524 U.S.  399, 407 \n(1998) (holding that the attorney-client privilege survives the \nclient's  death  because  \"(c]lients  may  be  concerned  about \nreputation,  civil  liability,  or  possible  harm  to  friends  or \nfamily\" and \"[p ]osthumous disclosure ... may be as feared as \ndisclosure during the client's lifetime\"). Here, even assuming \nany  of the  six  individuals  who  were  the  subject  of the \nprosecutions at issue have died, the relevant privacy interests \nremain substantial. Deceased defendants never convicted of a \ncrime  retain  a  reputational  interest  in  keeping  information \nconcerning their prosecutions out of the public eye. They may \nalso have family members who themselves have a legitimate \ninterest in avoiding the increased scrutiny that could follow \nfrom  the  release  of the  requested  docket  information.  Cf \nFavish, 541  U.S. at 170 (\"FOIA recognizes surviving family \nmembers' right to personal privacy with respect to their close \nrelative's death-scene images.\"). Given the substantial nature \nof these interests, we conclude that withholding the requested \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 17 of 32\n17 \ndocket information would be justified under Exemption 7(C) \neven if some or all of the underlying defendants were dead. \nAccordingly,  the  district  court  properly  granted  the \nDepartment's motion for summary judgment notwithstanding \nthe Department's apparent failure to investigate this issue. \nv. \nFor the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court's \ngrant of summary judgment to the Department. \nSo ordered. \n\n1:1 \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 18 of 32\nTATEL,  Circuit Judge,  concurring:  The  court's opinion \nassumes without deciding that the public interest in disclosure \nof the docket information for these six prosecutions is just as \ngreat as was the interest in disclosing the information for the \n214  prosecutions  the  Justice  Department  was  previously \nordered to release. See Majority Op. at 14. I write separately \nto explain why I believe this prior disclosure has substantially \nreduced  the value of the  remaining  information the  ACLU \ncontinues to seek, thus further tilting the balance in favor of \nwithholding. \nIn evaluating the public benefit of disclosure under FOIA \nExemption  7(C),  D.C.  Circuit  precedent  requires  that  we \nfocus on the \"incremental value\" of the \"specific information\" \nsought.  Schrecker v.  US.  Department of Justice,  349 F .3d \n657,  661  (D.C.  Cir.  2003);  accord,  e.g.,  Bast  v.  US. \nDepartment ofJ ustice, 665 F.2d 1251, 1254 (D.C. Cir. 1981); \nKing v.  US.  Department of Justice,  830  F.2d 210,  234-35 \n(D.C. Cir.  1987). That is, instead of simply asking whether \nthere  might  be  some general  public  interest  in  the  subject \nmatter of the  FOIA  request,  we  ask whether and how  the \ninformation sought in a particular FOIA request will actually \ncast light on the government's activities. See,  e.g., ACLU v. \nUS.  Department of Justice,  655  F.3d  I,  12-16 (D.C.  Cir. \n2011) (ACLU I). Examining the incremental value of a given \ndisclosure follows from  the basic purpose of the Exemption \n7(C) balancing test: determining whether a particular record \nor piece of information is worth the privacy costs of release \nrequires  an  assessment of the  potential  benefits  that would \nactually flow from release. \nWhen  assessing  the  \"incremental  value\"  of  the \ninformation sought,  we of course apply the common sense \nnotion that the value of information depends on the mix of \ndata  already  publicly  available-including  that  previously \nreleased by the agency subject to the FOIA request. In US. \nDepartment  of State  v.  Ray,  502  U.S.  164  (1991),  the \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 19 of 32\n2 \nSupreme  Court  illustrated  this  approach  in  the  process  of \nanalyzing  the  benefit  of  disclosing  information  retained \npursuant to  FOIA  Exemption  6,  a  parallel  exemption  that \nauthorizes withholding records if disclosure would \"constitute \na clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(b)(6).  In  Ray,  the  State  Department  had  released \ndocuments relating to its efforts to monitor Haiti's compliance \nwith its promise not to persecute certain refugees. In doing so, \nhowever,  the  State  Department  redacted  information \nregarding the  identity of the refugees-information that,  as \nthe Court recognized, would, in a vacuum, have been helpful \nto the FOIA requesters because it would have enabled them to \ntrack down the refugees and ask them about any persecution. \nSee Ray, 502 U.S. at 171, 177; cf id.  at  179 (observing that \nthe Court's resolution of the case allowed it to avoid deciding \nwhether  derivative  uses  of  disclosed  information  could \nqualify as a public interest in disclosure); ACLU I, 655 F.3d at \n15 (\"this court takes derivative uses into account in evaluating \nthe impact of disclosure on the public interest\"). The dissent \ncannot simply misquote away the value of this information. \nSee Dissenting Op. at 9 (quoting from section of the Court's \nopinion describing the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion \"that the \nredacted  information  would  not,  in  and  of  itself,  tell \nrespondents anything about Haiti's treatment of the returnees \nor this Government's honesty, but ... the indirect benefit of \ngiving respondents the means to locate the Haitian returnees \nand  to  cross-examine  them  provided  a  public  value  that \nrequired disclosure,\" Ray, 502 U.S. at 170-71.) Nevertheless, \nthe  Court  rejected  an  effort  to  ascertain  the  refugees' \nidentities  because  the  \"public  interest\"  had  already  been \n\"adequately served  by  disclosure  of the  redacted  interview \nsummaries.\"  Ray,  502  U.S.  at  178.  It  explained  that  the \nreleased  \"documents  reveal  how  many  returnees  were \ninterviewed, when the interviews took place, the contents of \nindividual  interviews,  and  details  about  the  status  of the \n\n,, \n1\" \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 20 of 32\n3 \ninterviewees.\" ld Thus,  it concluded, \"[t]he addition of the \nredacted  identifying  information  would  not  shed  any \nadditional  light  on  the  Government's  conduct  of  its \nobligation.\" /d,  (emphasis added). As the Court reiterated in \neven  clearer language:  \"[T]here is  nothing  in  the  record to \nsuggest that a second series of interviews with the already \ninterviewed returnees would produce any relevant information \nthat is not set forth in the documents that have already been \nproduced.\" Id at 179; accord, e.g, Painting & Drywall Work \nPreservation  Fund  v.  Department  of Housing  &  Urban \nDevelopment,  936  F.2d  1300,  1303  (D.C.  Cir.  1991) \n(concluding that the public interest in the disclosure of worker \nrecords  that  would  provide  information  on  agency \nenforcement efforts was minimal  because  interested parties \ncould obtain similar information through alternative means). \nPerhaps, as the dissent suggests, the relevant privacy interest \nin Ray was more substantial than here. See Dissenting Op. at \n8. But FOIA requires us to balance privacy interests against \nthe  benefits  of disclosure,  and  the  critical  point  for  our \npurposes  is  that  in  Ray  the  Court  evaluated  the  latter  by \nexamining the incremental effect of the information sought in \nlight of prior disclosures. \nConsistent with the  forgoing  principles,  and  given  the \nunique way in which this case has evolved, I believe that the \npublic interest at issue here is less than it was when the case \nwas previously before us. Of course, there is little doubt that \n\"[t)he  use  of and  justification  for  warrantless  cell  phone \ntracking\"  continues  to  be  a  \"topic  of considerable  public \ninterest.\" ACLU I, 655  F.3d  at  12; see,  e.g.,  Kate Zemike, \nCourt Restricts Police Searches of Phone Data, N.Y. Times, \nJuly 19, 2013, at AI  (describing differing positions taken by \ncourts  on  the  legality  and  propriety  of this  investigatory \ntechnique);  Joe  Palazzolo.  Montana  Requires  Warrants for \nCell  Phone  Tracking,  Wall  St.  J.  L.  Blog,  June  21,  2013, \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 21 of 32\n4 \nhttp://blogs. wsj .com/law/20 13/06/21/montana-requires \nwarrants-for-cell-phone-tracking (describing efforts by states \nto require police to obtain a warrant in order to access cell \nphone tracking information). The disclosure of these six cases \ncould  also  \"shed[]\"  at  least  some  additional  \"light on  the \nscope and effectiveness\" of this practice. ACLU I,  655 F.3d \nat 13. \nBut most ofthe benefit we anticipated from the release of \nthe  requested  docket information flowed  from  the  fact that \naccess to a large sample of prosecutions would provide a basis \nfor  the  public  to  discern  general  trends  regarding  the \ngovernment's use of cellphone tracking data and the means by \nwhich  the  government obtains such  data.  For example,  we \nobserved  that disclosure  would  \"provide  information  about \nthe kinds of crimes the government uses cell phone tracking \ndata to  investigate,\"  the \"standards the government  uses  to \njustify warrantless tracking,\" and \"facts regarding the duration \nof tracking and the quality of tracking data.\" !d. at 13-14. As \na result of the  district court's and our own prior decisions, \nhowever,  the  Department  has  already  released  docket \ninformation  for  214  prosecutions  in  which  the  government \nobtained cell phone tracking data without a warrant, and those \n214 cases presumably provide much of the necessary basis for \nassessing when,  how,  and why the  government utilizes this \nparticular  investigative  tool.  Compare  with  id.  at  14-15 \n(rejecting  government's  argument  that  release  of  the \ninformation  was  unnecessary  due  to  the  \"extensive  public \nattention that this issue is already receiving,\" because \"much \nof the  information  the  plaintiffs  seek  to  develop  from  the \nFOIA disclosure ... is  not currently in the public domain\" \n(internal quotation marks omitted)). True, the six remaining \ncases could contain some interesting anecdotal evidence: the \nACLU  speculates  that  it  is  \"more  likely  that  a  failed \nprosecution  involved\"  a  \"motion[]  to  suppress  evidence \n\nI\" \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 22 of 32\n5 \nderived  from  cell  phone  tracking,\"  and  that  suppression \nhearings  are  particularly likely to  yield  useful  information. \nAppellants'  Br.  33-34;  see  also  ACLU I,  655  F.3d  at  14 \n(describing  information  that  could  be  derived  from \nsuppression hearings). Even so, if the Department's disclosure \nof 214 prosecutions has failed to reveal the nature and extent \nof the government's practice of obtaining cell phone tracking \ndata without a warrant, the probability that disclosure of these \nsix  remaining  cases  would  yield  significant  benefits  is \nrelatively low. To paraphrase the Supreme Court in Ray, there \nis  little to  suggest that these six cases \"would produce any \nrelevant  information  that  is  not  set  forth  in  the  [214 \nprosecutions]  that  have  already  been  produced.\"  502  U.S. \nat 179. \nThe ACLU argues that applying the \"incremental value\" \ntest  in  this  fashion  would  give  federal  agencies  license  to \narbitrarily  withhold  portions  of  requested  records \npresumably \"the more important or embarrassing responsive \nrecords\"--on the ground that the public interest in disclosure \nwill be satiated by the records they choose to actually release. \nAppellants' Br. 35. Although I have no doubt that this court \nwould look with great suspicion on any attempt to manipulate \nFOIA in this fashion, this case involves no such mischief. It is \nwell-established that federal agencies may disclose particular \nrecords or portions of records responsive to a request without \ndisclosing all responsive records so  long as they have some \nlegitimate  FOlA-based  reason  for  doing  so.  See  5  U.S.C. \n§ 552(b)  (\"Any  reasonably  segregable  portion  of a  record \nshall be provided to any person requesting such record after \ndeletion  of  the  portions  which  are  exempt ....\" ); \nAssassination Archives &  Research Center v.  CIA, 334 F.Jd \n55, 58 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see also, e.g., Ray, 502 U.S. at 178-\n79;  King,  830 F.2d  at 234-35 (D.C.  Cir.  1987) (permitting \ngovernment  to  release  investigative  report  with  portions \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 23 of 32\n6 \nredacted  in  order to  protect  privacy interest of individuals \nnamed).  When,  for  example,  an  agency  withholds  certain \nrecords that implicate greater privacy interests than those  it \nreleases,  and  then  evaluates the  public  benefit of releasing \nthese remaining records  in  light of the  information already \nreleased, it acts just as FOIA requires-efficiently trading off \nprivacy costs and disclosure benefits. That is almost exactly \nwhat happened here. Having released all of the information \nour  prior  decision  required,  the  Department  now  resists \ndisclosure of a particular type of information that implicates \nstronger privacy interests. That being so,  I see no reason to \nnow disregard this prior disclosure. Just as we would certainly \ntake account of the existence of the docket information for \nthese 214 cases had it been uncovered and published by the \nWashington Post, we may take account of it here even though \nits release resulted from this litigation. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 24 of 32\nBROWN,  Circuit Judge,  dissenting:  While  l sympathize \nwith  the  court's  protective  instincts,  I  subscribe  to  Lady \nMacbeth's drear insight:  \"What's done cannot be  undone.\" \nRedemption  is  still  possible,  but  in  the  modem  world,  the \nright to be  left alone, once forfeited,  is gone for good.  An \nindividual who is  indicted and tried has no privacy interest \nthat  can  protect  the  public  record  of  prosecution  from \ndisclosure-even  if the  ultimate  outcome  was  acquittal  or \ndismissal.  The  residual  privacy  concerns  we  identified  in \nACLU  I  are  insufficient  to  meet  the  Exemption  7(C) \nthreshold.  There we noted that the privacy right at common \nlaw rested in large part on the \"degree of dissemination,\" and \nthat  \"interests  in  privacy  fade\"  when  the  information  is \nalready part of the public record and is readily available.  Am. \nCivil Liberties Union v.  US. Dep 't of Justice (ACLU !), 655 \nF.3d l, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  Because the privacy interest here \nstarted small and the pace of technology continues to diminish \nit, I respectfully dissent. \nAt the outset, I should note the court does get one thing \nright.  As  a  general  matter,  judges  tasked  with  balancing \nequally  metaphysical  concepts,  like  privacy  and  the  public \ninterest, face what are among the most difficult and largely \nstandardless endeavors.  See Reporters Comm. for Freedom of \nPress v.  US.  Dep't of Justice, 816 F.2d 730, 741  (D.C. Cir. \n1987) (expressing doubt that there is any principled basis for \nfederal  judges  to  make  such  ad  hoc  and  idiosyncratic \ndeterminations).  Even so, I agree the balancing in this case is \nrelatively clear.  The six disputed records already exist in the \npublic domain.  Indeed, the court acknowledges the records \nare accessible via a simple Google search or through PACER. \nFurthermore, the court correctly determines the public interest \nin disclosure is no more or Jess than it was in ACLU I.  There, \nwe characterized the public interest as \"significant.\"  ACLU I, \n655 F .3d at 12.  With one arm of the balance thus weighted, \nthe  only  question  is  whether  the  privacy  interests  of \nunconvicted persons tip  the  scales against disclosure.  The \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 25 of 32\n2 \ncourt today holds that the contest, while close, is nevertheless \nconvincingly won by a supposedly more substantial privacy \ninterest.  I am  not persuaded.  On balance, the permanence \nand accessibility of the records render any privacy interests \nonly  marginally  greater  than  they  were  in  A CL U  I,  thus \ntipping the balance in favor of disclosure. \nThe majority's privacy analysis rests on two pillars: the \npresumption  of  innocence  and  the  common  law  of \ninformational  privacy.  Both  notions  have  shortcomings. \nFirst,  the  presumption  of innocence  is  an  artifact  of the \ncommon law's adversarial approach to the question of guilt. \nWhat authority exists for the proposition that the presumption \nof innocence affords indicted, but unconvicted, persons some \nmeasure of informational privacy?  The Supreme Court has \nmade it clear that the presumption of innocence applies only \nto a criminal trial and, within the trial, only to the jury or other \ntrier of fact.  See Bell v.  Wo!fish,  441  U.S.  520, 533 (1979) \n(\"The presumption of innocence is a doctrine that allocates \nthe burden of proof in crimina/trials; it also may serve as an \nadmonishment  to  the jury  to  judge  an  accused's  guilt  or \ninnocence  solely  on  the  evidence  adduced  at  trial  . . ..\"  \n(emphasis added)).  Any  other,  extra-trial  reference  to  the \ndoctrine is both imprecise and impotent.  If, as the Supreme \nCourt  posits,  the  presumption  of innocence  is  purely  an \ninstrument  for  allocating  the  burden  of proof at  trial  and \nwarning  jurors  against  drawing  untoward  inferences,  then \nthere is no basis for supposing the presumption of innocence \ngoverns events beyond the trial itself.  Contra Majority Op. at \nI 0 (\"Individuals who are charged with a crime and ultimately \nprevail  of  course  remain  entitled  to  a  version  of  this \npresumption [of innocence].\").  And  why would a common \nlaw presumption trump FOIA 's statutory mandate? \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 26 of 32\n3 \nThe  court hypothesizes  the  plight  of individuals  who, \nthough  never  convicted,  are  viewed  with  suspicion  when \nothers learn of their mere involvement in particularly ignoble \ncases.  See Majority Op. at 13.  But even if true, persons who \nare  publicly  indicted  and  tried  can  have  no  reasonable \nexpectation that the occurrence of these  events will  not be \npublicly  disclosed.  Risk of disclosure  inheres  in  the  very \nnature of these public proceedings.  See Craig v.  Harney, 331 \nU.S.  367,  374  (1947)  (\"A  trial  is  a  public  event.  What \ntranspires in the court room is public property.\").  To be sure, \nwe previously discounted the small but nonetheless real risk \nof renewed  attention,  dismissing  such  concerns  as  sheer \n\"speculation.\"  See ACLU I, 655 F.3d at 10-11  (\"Such a list \n[of publicly  indicted  persons]  is  surely  less  likely  to  draw \nattention to a name than was the initial press coverage of an \nindictment ....\" ). \nFurthermore, what of the need for an informed citizenry \nto hold public officials accountable?  One \"purpose of FOIA \nis to permit the public to decide for itself whether government \naction is proper.\" Wash.  Post Co.  v.  U.S.  Dep't of Health & \nHuman Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 264 (D.C.

From  the  point  of view  of the \nwrongfully accused, this will be a continuing injustice, but a \nperson can be found not guilty and still not be innocent of the \ncrime charged.  See Rigsbee v.  United States, 204 F .2d 70, \n72-73 (D.C. Cir. 1953) (holding that an acquittal differs from \ninnocence and that the fonner would be insufficient by itself \nto  obtain  a  certificate  signifying  the  latter).  The  rough \nbalance courts must strike can never resolve such anomalies. \nThe  Court's  reliance  on  common  law  informational \nprivacy doctrine is similarly unavailing.  \"[B]oth the common \nlaw and the literal understandings of privacy encompass the \nindividual's  control  of  [personal]  infonnation.\"  Reporters \nComm.,  489  U.S.  at 763.  The touchstone of informational \nprivacy-the right to  be  let  alone-has long  rested  on  the \ndegree  to  which  an  allegedly  private  fact  has  been \ndisseminated, and the extent to which the passage of time has \nrendered it private.  !d.  Nevertheless, technological advances \nseem to presage the death knell for this previously workable \nstandard.  In today's echo chamber of big data, metadata, and \nthe  Internet,  the  once  wholly  forgotten  memory  of some \nunsavory,  minimally  broadcast  misdeed  is  resurrected  for \nglobal consumption.  Against this backdrop, it seems fanciful \nto  believe  that  individuals  who  were  publicly  indicted  but \nnever convicted (though in some cases publicly tried), retain \nan  objective,  substantial  privacy  interest  in  controlling \ninfonnation about these public facts. \nThe court says unconvicted persons are \"entitled to move \non with their lives without having the public reminded of their \nalleged but never proven transgressions.\"  Majority Op. at II. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 28 of 32\n5 \nAlas,  Google,  unlike  God,  neither  forgets  nor  forgives.1 \nIndeed, Google is not alone in its uncanny ability to keep the \nproverbial  score.  It  is  true  that  most  jurisdictions  treat \naggregations  of data confidentially,  but they  also  insist  on \ntransparency  for  records  of individual  cases.  Courts,  too, \nhave a penchant for reminding acquitted individuals of their \n\"alleged but never proven transgressions.\"  See, e.g., Dowling \nv.  United  States,  493  U.S.  342,  354  (1990)  (holding  that \nadmission of evidence relating to a crime the defendant had \npreviously  been  acquitted  of committing  did  not  violate \ndouble  jeopardy  or  due  process);  United  States  v.

Thanks \nto the Internet (for better or worse), information that was once \nscattered, localized, and forgotten with the passage of time is \nnow effectively permanent and searchable.  And though one \nmight wish quietly to melt into the shadow of obscurity, the \ninexorable  march  of  time  is  simply  no  match  for  the \nunflagging, unforgiving memory that is the World Wide Web. \nThere  are  exceptions,  of  course,  but  records \nmemorializing a public indictment and trial do not appear to \nbe  one  of  them.  See  Removal  Policies,  GOOGLE, \nhttps://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2744324#offen \nsiveimages (last visited Apr. 23, 2014). \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 29 of 32\n6 \nOnce  a  secret  is  disclosed  online,  neither  the  courts  nor \nsociety  may  unring the  lingering echo of the  bell.  In  this \nrespect, Reporters Committee is an anachronism.  The aspects \nof an \"ordinary citizen['s]\" criminal history the Court thought \nwould  be  wholly  forgotten  were  the  data contained  in  rap \nsheets,  which  were  maintained  in  a  localized  computer \ndatabase.  See Reporters Comm., 489 U.S.  at 752,  771; see \nalso ACLU I,  655  F.3d at 8.  Nowadays, bits and pieces of \ndata are aggregated and immortalized on public and private \nsystems, and the private systems have no purge schedules. \nThis  is  not to  say  the  modem  man  has  abdicated any \nexpectation of privacy  in  facts  partially disclosed.  As  the \nSupreme Court observed, \"'the fact that an event is not wholly \nprivate does  not mean that an  individual  has  no  interest in \nlimiting  disclosure  or  dissemination  of the  information.\" \nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 770.  But there is a vast chasm \nbetween  facts  disclosed  to  a discrete  group  that  otherwise \ntreats  the  information  as  private  and  facts  that  are \nunqualifiedly  revealed and  accessible to  virtually everyone. \nIn my view, the case before us falls into the latter camp.  Cf \nid.  at  752  (\"As  a  matter  of executive  policy,  [DOJ]  has \ngenerally treated rap sheets as confidential and, with certain \nexceptions,  has  restricted  their  use  to  governmental \npurposes.\"); Dep't ofA  ir Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352,359--60 \n(noting that the Academy  treated \"all matters discussed\" at \nhearings for honor code violations as \"confidential,\" marked \ncase summaries \"for official use only,\" and instructed cadets \n\"not to  read  the  case  summary  unless  they  have  a  need, \nbeyond mere curiosity, to know their contents\"). \nConsidering the fissures in the two pillars supporting the \ncourt's  privacy  analysis,  one  would  expect  the  privacy \ninterests to become less significant.  At the very least, these \nserious deficits ought give way  to  the court's obligation  to \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 30 of 32\n7 \n\"make a reasonable effort to account for the death of a person \non  whose  behalf  the  [agency]  invokes  Exemption  7(C). \nSchrecker v.  US.  Dep't of Justice, 349 F.3d 657, 662 (D.C. \nCir. 2003).  This would include the deaths of family members. \nAfter all, \"death clearly matters, as the deceased by definition \ncannot personally suffer the privacy-related injuries that may \nplague the  living.\"  Campbell v.  US.  Dep 't of Justice,  164 \nF.3d  20,  33  (D.C.  Cir.  1998).  I  am  not  swayed  by  the \nmajority's contention that reputational interests are enough to \ncarry  the  day.  The  posthumous  reputational  interest  the \nSupreme  Court  recognized  in  Swid/er  &  Berlin  v.  United \nStates, 524 U.S. 399 (1998), is the one rooted in the venerable \nattorney-client privilege, not informational  privacy.  See  id. \n(holding that the attorney-client privilege survives a client's \ndeath). \nOne  last  point  warrants  discussion.  Judge  Tatel's \nconcurrence seeks to lend credence to DOJ' s invocation of the \nincremental value test-a test allegedly of precedential value. \nl am not so certain.  First, the test is of dubious provenance. \nIn King v.  US. Dep 't ofJ ustice, 830 F.2d 210, 234 (D.C. Cir. \n1987),  the  case  cited  by  Schrecker  as  authority  for  its \nstatement about the  incremental  value test,  the  court never \nactually  used  the  words  \"incremental value.\"  Instead,  the \ncourt  merely  held  that,  because  the  appellant  failed  to \ndemonstrate how disclosing the redacted names was relevant \nto the public interest, the privacy  interests \"outweighed any \npublic interest attending disclosure.\"  See id. at 234-35.  That \nis  all.  King  did  not  hold  that  the  incremental  value  of \ninformation  depends  on  the  mix  of data  already  publicly \navailable. \nIn the 200-plus FOIA cases since the Schrecker decision, \nwe  have  referenced  the  incremental  value  test  only  three \ntimes.  In  each  instance,  we  have  understood  it  to  mean \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 31 of 32\n8 \nexactly the opposite of what the concurrence posits: \"even if \nthe 'absolute value' of the requested information is small, it \nmust nevertheless be released if it adds any incremental value \nof public interest.\"  Appellants' Reply Br. at 15; see ACLU I, \n655  F.3d at  15  (rejecting DOJ's \"incremental contribution\" \nargument because \"(t]he fact that the public already has some \ninformation  does  not  mean  that more  will not advance the \npublic interest\" (emphasis added)); Lardner v.  U.S.  Dep't of \nJustice,  398 F. App'x 609, 611  (D.C.  Cir. 2010) (affirming \nthe district court's decision to disclose the identities of denied \npardon  and  commutation  applicants  despite  the  previous \ndisclosure and existence of approved applicants' identities on \nthe  public  record.  Significantly,  the  court  noted:  \"The \nincremental  value  of  the  withheld  information  is  not \nspeculative ... .''); Consumers' Checkbook Ctr. for the Study \nof Servs.  v.  US.  Dep 't of Health & Human Servs., 554 F.3d \nI 046,  1060 (D.C.  Cir. 2009) (Rogers, J.,  concurring in part \nand dissenting in part) (\"(E]ven though the requested data will \nonly partially reveal  physicians'  experience levels,  the data \nhas 'incremental value' for ascertaining the quality of services \nperformed.\"). \nIn  any event, even assuming the court is bound by the \nversion of the incremental value test Judge Tate! espouses, the \ncases cited in support of this test are all distinguishable for \none  reason  or another.  In  Ray,  for  example,  the  privacy \ninterests  were  more  significant than  those  implicated  here. \nThe  information  redacted  from  the  disputed  records  was \nobtained  via  interviews  with  requested  Haitians  who  were \npromised confidentiality.  US. Dep 't ofS tate v. Ray, 502 U.S. \n164,  172 (1991).  In other words, the parties agreed to treat \nthe information obtained as private.  Furthermore, the Court's \nconclusion  that  \"(t]he  addition  of the  redacted  identifying \ninformation  would  not  shed  any  additional  light  on  the \nGovernment's conduct of its obligation,\" id. at 178 (emphasis \n\n..- ----------------r-------------, \nCase 1:08-cv-01157-ABJ   Document 70-1   Filed 08/20/14   Page 32 of 32\n9 \nadded), is in accord with this court's prior application of the \ntest.  The  redacted  information  was  withheld  precisely \nbecause the Court recognized that, \"in and of itself' it would \nnot \"tell respondents anything about Haiti's treatment of the \nreturnees  or  this  Government's  honesty.\"  Jd.  at  170-71 \n(emphasis added). \nPerhaps  most  importantly,  however,  Ray  involved \nredacted  information, not wholly undisclosed  records.  The \ndifference is not merely academic.  Judge Tatel's version of \nthe incremental value test would make little sense where, as \nhere,  a  court  is  dealing  with  undisclosed  records  that  are \nsubstantively  dissimilar  to  records  previously  disclosed. \nUnlike Ray, where the redacted  information was  sought so \nthat interviews with Haitians could be conducted anew, 502 \nU.S. at 178-79, disclosing the records ofunconvicted persons \nwould be neither duplicative nor speculative.  It is reasonable \nto  believe  the  six  files  could  contain  new  information \nprecisely  because  the  records  sought-unlike  the  Haitian \ninterviewees-are qualitatively different.  In fact, Judge Tate! \nagrees.  Concurring Op.  at 4 (\"The  disclosure of these  six \ncases could also  shed at  least  some additional  light  on  the \nscope  and  effectiveness  of  [warrantless  cell  phone \ntracking].\").  Nothing more is required. \nAt  bottom,  the  public  interest  in  disclosure  remains  as \nrobust as it was in A CL U I.  Conversely, in the Internet age, \nprivacy is no longer what it once was.  Times have changed, \nand so, too, must our expectations.  I respectfully dissent. ",
