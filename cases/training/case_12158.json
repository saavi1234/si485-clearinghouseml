They claimed that under New York's Human Rights Law (Executive Law § 290, et seq.), it was the schools' responsibility to stop this discrimination.</p><p>The defendants, two New York school districts, claimed that because they were public schools, as opposed to private, non-secular schools, they did not fall within the scope of the legislation.</p><p>After a series of rulings by the lower courts, on June 12, 2012, the New York Court of Appeals (Judge Eugene F. Piggott, Jr.) ruled that because the language in the Human Rights Law was modeled after the Real Property Tax Law of 1896 (which only covered private, non-secular schools), the legislature must have meant that the Human Rights Law should not apply to public schools. Judge Piggott noted that his \"holding is not to be interpreted as indifference to [the Plaintiffs'] plight, since the merits of their underlying discrimination claims are not at issue on these appeals. Nor does our holding leave public school students without a remedy. In addition to potential remedies under federal law, public school students may file a complaint with the Commissioner of Education.\" Matter of North Syracuse Cent. School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human Rights, 2012 WL 2092954 (N.Y. June 12, 2012).</p><p>In a bitter dissent, Judge Carmen Ciparick argued that the New York constitution equal protection clause prohibits public and private discrimination, and that the Human Rights Law should be liberally construed to include public schools. She noted that while victims of race discrimination have an adequate remedy through federal law, this holding was a particularly strong blow to the LGBT community, which is only afforded remedy through state law. </p><p>As of this writing, the Plaintiffs have yet to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for certiorari. </p>",

Far more specific and inclusive \nthan federal antidiscrimination statutes, the HRL bars direct discrimination by \nschools and also expressly prohibits them from permitting the harassment of any \nstudent based on “race, color, religion, disability, national origin, sexual \n1\norientation, military status, sex, age or marital status.”  Exec. Law § 296(4).   And, \nthrough the New York State Division of Human Rights (the “Division” or \n“Respondent”), the HRL provides students with a uniquely affordable and \naccessible forum in which to seek remedies and redress for violation of their rights.  \nSee id. §§ 295, 297.  These comprehensive protections play a critical role in \ncarrying out the HRL’s express purpose of ensuring equal opportunity in education \nand “fulfill[ing] . . . the provisions of the constitution of this state concerning civil \nrights.”  Id. § 290(2); see also id. § 291. \nDespite § 296(4)’s plain text and relevant case precedents, Appellant North \nSyracuse Central School District (“Appellant” or the “School District”) would \neradicate these protections for students throughout the state, arguing that, as the \nsupreme court below erroneously concluded, the term “education corporation or \nassociation” as used in § 296(4) does not include public school districts or other \n                                           \n1 The HRL is codified in the state’s Executive Law.  See Exec. Law §§ 290 to 301.  \n1 \n\npublic educational institutions.  Under that interpretation, millions of students who \nattend public schools – the vast majority of New York’s schoolchildren – would be \ndeprived of the HRL’s protection. The Appellate Division vacated that writ on \ngrounds that did not require it to address the proper interpretation of the HRL, and \namici recognize that this Court, similarly, may leave the resolution of that question \nfor another day.  However, if this Court determines that interpretation of the HRL \nis necessary or appropriate to the resolution of this appeal, amici submit this brief \nto assist the Court in understanding that the adoption of the School District’s \ninterpretation of the HRL would contradict the statute’s text and this Court’s \nprecedents, be inconsistent with decisions of state and federal courts favoring \napplication of the HRL to public institutions, violate the statute’s mandate of \nliberal construction, thwart the legislature’s clearly expressed intent, and produce \nabsurd and unjust results. \nThe sole purpose of this brief is to address whether the HRL’s prohibition of \ndiscrimination in and by education corporations and associations applies to school \ndistricts and other public educational institutions.  This brief takes no position on \nthe other issues raised by the parties, such as the issue identified in Point I of the \nDivision’s brief.  See Respondent’s Br. at 9-26 (addressing whether the complaint \nfiled with the Division is one “that the [HRL] authorizes the Division to determine, \nsubject to judicial review of the final disposition”).  And while amici are unified in \n2 \n\ntheir opposition to discrimination and harassment in education, whether based on \nrace or any other impermissible factor, this brief takes no position on the merits of \nthe underlying claims of discriminatory harassment.   \n \nSTATEMENTS OF INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE \nFor forty years Advocates for Children of New York, Inc. (“AFC”) has been \nworking with low-income families to secure quality and equal public education \nservices for their children.  AFC provides a range of direct services, including free \nindividual case advocacy, technical assistance, and trainings, and also works on \ninstitutional reform of educational policies and practices.  As advocates for fair \ntreatment and protection against discrimination for young people in public schools, \nAFC joins this amicus brief to support application of the protections of the HRL to \npublic school students. \nOrganized in 1913 to advance good will and mutual understanding among \nAmericans of all creeds and races and to combat racial, ethnic, and religious \nprejudice in the United States, the Anti-Defamation League (“ADL”) is today one \nof the world’s leading organizations fighting hatred, bigotry, discrimination, and \nanti-Semitism.  As part of that mission, ADL is a leading provider of anti-bias \neducation and diversity training programs that help create and sustain inclusive \nhome, school, community, and work environments.  Further, over the past decade, \n3 \n\nthe ADL has been recognized as a leading resource on effective responses to \nviolent bigotry, drafting model hate crime statutes for state legislatures and \nlobbying on behalf of strengthened prevention and deterrence initiatives.   The \nHRL provides a crucial recourse for New York’s residents to stand up against \nbigotry, bullying, harassment and discrimination in the community.  This case \ncompels the ADL to file as amicus to defend particularly the rights of students to \nchallenge an unsafe learning environment. \nSince 1989, it has been Disability Advocates’ mission to protect and \nadvance the rights of adults and children who have disabilities.  Disability \nAdvocates assists persons with disabilities in freely making the decisions that \naffect their lives, enforcing their rights, and fully participating in community life. \nDisability Advocates’ advocacy and litigation has defeated efforts to exclude \npersons with disabilities from community housing, assured the accessibility of \nmovie theaters and state-operated community residences, established the right to \ncounsel at public expense for indigent persons subject to guardianship proceedings, \nstopped dangerous experiments on patients in state psychiatric hospitals, and \nobtained compensation for victims of unnecessary and unconsented prostate \nsurgery.  More information about Disability Advocates’ past and present advocacy \nfor persons with disabilities is available at www.disability-advocates.org.   \n4 \n\nA major focus of Disability Advocates’ work involves assisting students \nwith disabilities who face discrimination or denial of rights by public school \ndistricts.  Because the demand for assistance far exceeds resources, Disability \nAdvocates frequently refers persons with disabilities to the New York State \nDivision for Human Rights, which can investigate, mediate and remedy \ndiscrimination suffered without the need for a lawyer, and without incurring \nlitigation expenses.  If this forum becomes unavailable to students of public \nschools, there will often be no other forum and no other remedy available to \nredress the discrimination they have suffered.   \nFounded in 1990, the Empire State Pride Agenda (the “Pride Agenda”) is \nNew York’s statewide civil rights and advocacy group committed to winning \nequality and justice for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (“LGBT”) New \nYorkers and their families.  The Pride Agenda has offices in New York City, \nAlbany and Rochester and is one of the largest statewide LGBT organizations in \nthe country.  It is dedicated to ensuring that all New Yorkers are protected from \ndiscrimination and bias-motivated harassment and violence, and as part of its core \npriorities has worked to secure measures that protect teachers and other staff from \nemployment discrimination and public school students from bullying and \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.  \nThe Pride Agenda was instrumental in passage of New York’s Sexual Orientation \n5 \n\nNon-Discrimination Act (“SONDA”), which in 2003 added sexual orientation to \nthe state’s Human Rights Law, and is currently working to pass the Gender \nExpression Non-Discrimination Act (“GENDA”) to similarly add gender identity \nand expression.  The Pride Agenda was also among the lead groups advocating for \nthe Dignity for All Students Act passed in 2010 to prevent and address bias-based \nbullying and discrimination in the New York State’s public schools.    \nThe Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (“GLSEN”) is the leading \nnational education organization focused on ensuring safe schools for all students.  \nEstablished nationally in 1995, GLSEN envisions a world in which every child \nlearns to respect and accept all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity/expression.  GLSEN seeks to develop school climates where difference is \nvalued for the positive contribution it makes to creating a more vibrant and diverse \ncommunity.  As an advocate for fair treatment and protection against \ndiscrimination for young people in public schools, GLSEN joins this amicus brief \nto support application of the HRL’s protections to public school students. \nThe Ithaca Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Task Force (“The Task \nForce”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Ithaca, New York, and \nserves the Tompkins County area.  The Task Force advocates for the creation of a \nsocial and cultural environment that nurtures a wide range of gender, sexuality, and \nfamily arrangements.  It encourages an awareness of issues affecting LGBT people \n6 \n\nby conducting public meetings, informational programs, artistic events, and social \nactivities to work towards the elimination of prejudice and discrimination and to \nimprove relationships and understanding among and between LGBT and \nheterosexual and cisgender people.  The Task Force believes that if the HRL is \nfound to not apply to public school districts, it would have a devastating effect on \nthe safety of LGBT students in New York by stripping away the strongest legal \nprotections available to them against discrimination and harassment in school. \nLambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc. (\"Lambda Legal\") is a \nnational organization, with headquarters in New York, committed to achieving full \nrecognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people \nand those with HIV through impact litigation, education and public policy work.  \nAdvocacy on behalf of students who face discrimination, harassment, violence and \ncensorship at school on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity has long \nformed a central part of Lambda Legal's work.  See, e.g., Nabozny v. Podlesny, 92 \nF.3d 446 (7th Cir. 1996); Pratt v. Indian River Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 7:09-cv-0411, \n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32596 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2011); Henkle v. Gregory, 150 \nF. Supp. 2d 1067 (D. Nev. 2001); Colin v. Orange Unified Sch. Dist., 83 F. Supp. \n2d 1135 (C.D. Cal. 2000); E. High Sch. PRISM Club v. Seidel, 95 F. Supp. 2d 1239 \n(D. Utah 2000); E. High Gay/Straight Alliance v. Bd. of Educ. of Salt Lake City \nSch. Dist., 81 F. Supp. 2d 1166 (D. Utah 1999).   \n7 \n\nIn New York, Lambda Legal has played an active role in controversies \nsurrounding the proper interpretation of the HRL's protections for students.   \nBecause § 296(4) specifically prohibits schools from denying the use of their \nfacilities or \"permit[ting] the harassment of any student\" on the basis of sexual \norientation, this Court's interpretation of the statute's scope will have a profound \nimpact on the young people in New York served by Lambda Legal's mission. \nThe NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (\"LDF\") is a non-\nprofit legal organization that assists African Americans and other people of color \nin securing their civil and constitutional rights. For more than six decades, LDF has \nworked to dismantle racial segregation and ensure equal educational opportunity.  \nIn support of this mission, LDF has played and continues to play a critical role in \nensuring that laws prohibiting discrimination are upheld and vigorously applied. \nThe New York Civil Liberties Union (“NYCLU”), an affiliate of the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, is a non-profit, non-partisan membership \norganization whose mission is to defend and promote federal and state \nconstitutional rights, as well as statutory rights that protect core civil rights and \nliberties.  Defending and enhancing the constitutional and statutory rights of all \nstudents to obtain a public education free from discrimination, harassment, and \nbullying is a core part of the NYCLU’s work.  The NYCLU routinely represents \nand advocates on behalf of public school students who are the victims of \n8 \n\ndiscrimination and harassment by public school administrators, teachers, or their \npeers in both judicial and administrative fora.  The NYCLU also frequently \nappears before this Court as a party or amicus in cases that raise civil rights and \ncivil liberties questions with widespread import.  Because this case implicates \nevery New York public school student’s right to equal educational opportunity, \nand because its resolution will impact a group of New Yorkers the NYCLU \nfrequently serves and advocates for, we join this amicus curiae brief defending the \napplication of the NYHRL to public schools. \nParents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (“PFLAG”) National is \na nonprofit organization with over 200,000 members and supporters in all fifty \nstates and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  PFLAG promotes the health and \nwell-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, their families and \nfriends through: support, to cope with an adverse society; education, to enlighten \nan ill-informed public; and advocacy, to end discrimination and to secure equal \ncivil rights.  PFLAG provides the opportunity for dialogue about sexual orientation \nand gender identity, and acts to create a society that is healthy and respectful of \nhuman diversity.  PFLAG works to create a world in which all young people may \ngrow up and be educated with freedom from fear of violence, bullying and other \nforms of discrimination, regardless of their actual or perceived gender identity or \nsexual orientation or that of their families.  As advocates for fair treatment and \n9 \n\nprotection against discrimination for young people in public schools, PFLAG joins \nthis amicus brief to support application of the protections of the HRL to public \nschool students. \n10 \n\nARGUMENT \nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW APPLIES TO PUBLIC SCHOOL \nDISTRICTS. \nUnder New York’s HRL, a nonsectarian and tax-exempt “education \ncorporation or association” may not deny the use of its facilities to – and may not \npermit the harassment of – any student based on “race, color, religion, disability, \nnational origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, age or marital status.”  \nExec. Law § 296(4).  A public school district is both an “education corporation” \nand an “education association” for purposes of the HRL, and therefore may neither \n2\ndiscriminate nor permit discriminatory harassment.   That conclusion is supported \nby this Court’s holdings and by decisions of other New York state and federal \ncourts.   \nThis Court should not underestimate the significance of an interpretation \nexcluding public schools from § 296(4)’s scope.  The New York State Department \nof Education reports that during the 2007-2008 academic year (when the complaint \nat issue in this case was filed), more than three million students attended \nelementary, middle and high school in New York.  Approximately 2.7 million of \nthose schoolchildren—nearly eighty-six percent of the total—attended public \n                                           \n2There can be no serious dispute that a public school district meets § 296(4)’s only other two \nconditions of applicability: that the entity be nonsectarian; and that it be exempt from taxation \nunder Article 4 of the Real Property Tax Law.  See Real Prop. Tax Law § 408.  \n11 \n\nschools.3  Of the children attending nonpublic schools, more than 380,000 attended \nreligiously affiliated schools that are beyond the reach of § 296(4), which applies \nonly to entities that are “nonsectarian.”  Under the interpretation advocated by the \nSchool District and adopted by the supreme court below, the HRL would protect a \nscant number of students – barely two percent of New York’s school-age \n4\npopulation.    \nThe School District seeks – and the supreme court below erroneously \nadopted – a construction of § 296(4) placing public school districts and their \nstudents beyond the HRL’s reach, which would thwart the extremely strong and \nlongstanding state policy of equal educational opportunities for all of the state’s \nchildren.  Instead, equal educational opportunity would be offered to only the small \nnumber of students attending non-religious private schools.  The HRL embodies \nNew York’s unwavering commitment to a policy of equal opportunity – including \n                                           \n3 The data in this paragraph is drawn from tables compiled by the New York State Education \nDepartment, reporting on public and non-public school enrollment.  Table 2, Trends of \nNonpublic School Enrollment by Affiliation, Grades K-12, New York State 2006-07 to 2010-11, \navailable at http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/statistics/nonpublic/TABLE2.pdf; Table 4, Trends of \nPublic and Nonpublic Enrollment, Grades K-12 New York State 1970-71 to 2010-11, available \nat http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/statistics/nonpublic/TABLE4.pdf.   \n4 The data for enrollment during other academic years is similar.  For example, during the 2010-\n2011 academic year, 3,053,621 students attended elementary, middle and high school in New \nYork State.  Of those, 2,637,578 (more than 86%) attended public schools, and nearly 350,000 \nattended religiously-affiliated schools – with less than 68,000 (or about 2%) attending schools \nthat are both private and nonsectarian.  Table 2, Trends of Nonpublic School Enrollment by \nAffiliation, Grades K-12, New York State 2006-07 to 2010-11, available at \nhttp://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/statistics/nonpublic/TABLE2.pdf; Table 4, Trends of Public and \nNonpublic Enrollment, Grades K-12 New York State 1970-71 to 2010-11, available at \nhttp://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/statistics/nonpublic/TABLE4.pdf. \n12 \n\neducational opportunity – and expressly calls on courts to liberally construe its \nprovisions to accomplish its broad remedial purposes.  See Exec. Law §§ 290, 291, \n296(4), 300; see also Cahill v. Rosa, 89 N.Y.2d 14, 20 (1996).  Appellant and, \nrespectfully, the supreme court below acknowledged neither this fundamental \npolicy of equal education opportunity nor the liberal construction mandate of the \nHRL itself.  Appellant’s argument on that point, if adopted, would undermine the \nsafety of schoolchildren throughout the state by improperly restricting the HRL’s \nprotection to only a tiny percentage of student population – those attending schools \nthat are not only private but also nonsectarian.  Amici respectfully submit that if \nthis Court determines that resolution of this appeal requires it to interpret the HRL, \nthe proper conclusion is that § 296(4) protects students against discrimination and \nharassment in public schools, as the Third Department recently held in Matter of \nIthaca City School District v. New York State Division of Human Rights, 87 \nA.D.3d 268, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686 (3d Dep’t 2011), and the contrary conclusion of the \nsupreme court below should be rejected.  \nA.   A public school district is an “education corporation or association” \nunder § 296(4) of the Human Rights Law.  \nThe HRL protects students from discrimination by, and discriminatory \nharassment in, any “education corporation or association.”  Exec. Law § 296(4).5  \n                                           \n5As explained in section B below, the HRL is to be construed liberally to effectuate its broad \npurposes.  Exec. Law § 300.  The HRL’s purposes include “eliminat[ing] and prevent[ing] \n13 \n\nRecently, in a decision squarely addressing § 296(4)’s scope, the Third Department \nheld that public school districts are encompassed within its protections.  Ithaca \nCity Sch. Dist., 87 A.D.3d 268, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686.  In rejecting a challenge by the \nschool district in that case to the Division’s HRL-based jurisdiction over the \ncomplaint, the Third Department “conclude[d] that public school districts are \namong the ‘educational institutions’ over which [the Division] has jurisdiction and \nthat Executive Law § 296(4) is the statutory mechanism by which it can seek to \neliminate any discrimination by such school districts.”  Id. at 273, 690.   \nThe Third Department explained that (consistent with this Court’s repeated \nadmonitions, summarized in Section B below) the HRL “must be liberally \nconstrued to accomplish its beneficial purposes – one of which is to eliminate \ndiscrimination in ‘educational institutions’ (Exec. L. § 290, 300) – ‘and to spread \nits beneficial results as widely as possible.”  Id. at 273, 689-690 (citing Matter of \nRizzo v. New York State Div. of Hous. & Cmty. Renewal, 6 N.Y.3d 104, 114 \n(2005); Matter of Crucible Materials Corp. v. New York Power Auth., 50 A.D.3d \n1353, 1355-56 (2008), aff’d 13 N.Y.3d 223 (2009)).  It held that it would be \n“clearly contrary to the express purpose of the [HRL]” to limit its protection “to \nonly a minuscule percentage of students whose families can afford to send them to \n                                                                                                                                        \ndiscrimination in . . . educational institutions,” id. § 290(3), and “eliminat[ing] . . . discrimination \nby the state or any agency or subdivision of the state.”  Bd. of Higher Educ. of City of N.Y. v. \nCarter, 16 A.D.2d 443, 447 (1st Dep’t 1962) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), \naff’d as modified on other grounds, 14 N.Y.2d 138 (1964).   \n14 \n\nprivate, non-religious schools, relegating public school students to other more \nonerous and/or less comprehensive remedies.” Id. at 273, 690.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Third Department rejected arguments that a different conclusion \nwas required based on definitions in the General Construction Law (“GCL”) – \nwithout deciding the correct interpretation of the GCL definitions – because a \nconstruction of § 296(4)’s terms that would exclude public school districts from \nthe HRL’s coverage would be “inappropriate and unreasonable,” id., and GCL § \n110 provides that its definitions are not intended to apply if the “general object, or \nthe context of the language construed, or other provisions of law indicate that a \ndifferent meaning or application was intended from that required to be given by the \n[GCL].”  Ithaca City Sch. Dist., 926 N.Y.S.2d at 689 (quoting GCL § 110). \nAlthough the Third Department deemed it unnecessary to address the proper \nconstruction of the GCL’s definitions of “education corporation” and “education \nassociation,” those definitions, properly construed, do encompass public school \ndistricts.  The GCL incorporates the definition of “education corporation” set forth \nin § 216-a(1) of the Education Law – a definition that expressly includes all \n“corporation[s] . . . formed under” the Education Law.  GCL § 66(6).6  Public \n                                           \n6Other subsections of Education Law § 216-a provide that the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law \n(“NPCL”) shall apply to education corporations in certain circumstances.  But the NPCL “shall \nnot apply” to education corporations where the NPCL’s provisions “conflict[] with a provision of \n[the Education Law].”  Educ. Law § 216-a(4)(a).  And § 216-a’s provisions regarding the NPCL \nare not incorporated into the GCL’s definition of “education corporation.” See Gen. Constr. Law \n15 \n\nschool districts in New York are defined as “corporations” both in the state \nconstitution and in statute.  Const. Art. 10, § 5; Gen. Constr. Law § 66(2). And \npublic school districts are “formed under” the Education Law. See, e.g., Educ. Law \n§§ 1501, 1504, 1522.  See also Pocantico Home & Land Co. v. Union Free Sch. \nDist. of the Tarrytowns, 20 A.D.3d 458, 461 (2d Dep’t 2005) (“School districts in \nthis State are creatures of statute, which can only be formed, dissolved, or altered \nin accordance with . . . the Education Law.”).7  Therefore, public school districts \nare “education corporations.”8 \nFurthermore, independent of its existence as an “education corporation,” a \nschool district is an “education . . . association” governed by the HRL.  Exec. Law \n§ 296(4).  The term “association” is interpreted “broad[ly]” under New York law \n                                                                                                                                        \n§ 66(6) (incorporating only subdivision one of Education Law § 216-a).  See also footnote 7 \nbelow. \n7Even school districts pre-dating the Education Law or originally formed pursuant to a different \nstatute are deemed “formed under” the Education Law, because Education Law § 1501(1) \nprovides that “[a]ll school districts organized either by special laws or pursuant to the provisions \nof a general law are hereby continued.” \n8 In its brief in this appeal, the Division does not rely on GCL § 66(6) or Education Law § 216-a \nin reaching the conclusion that public school districts are “education corporations.”  Respondent \nBr. at 29.  Amici respectfully urge incorporation of analyses of both of these provisions, and in \nany case agree with the Division’s ultimate conclusion, namely, that public school districts are \n“education corporations” for purposes of § 296(4).  Specifically, the Commissioner’s otherwise \ncogent analysis does not account for the fact that GCL § 66(6) – through its incorporation of \nEducation Law § 216-a(1) – defines “education corporation” to include all “corporation[s] . . . \nformed under this chapter.” The term “this chapter” refers to the Education Law in its entirety.  \nSee Educ. Law § 1 (“This chapter shall be known as the ‘Education Law.’”).  Hundreds of \nprovisions in the Education Law – including other subdivisions of § 216-a – use the word \n“chapter” to refer to the entire Education Law.  See id. § 216-a(4)(a); see also, e.g., id. §§ 2, 112, \n293, 355, 501, 712, 1004-a, 1501, 1950. \n16 \n\n“to include a wide assortment of differing organizational structures . . . , depending \non the context.” Mohonk Trust v. Bd. of Assessors of Gardiner, 47 N.Y.2d 476, 483 \n(1979).  Numerous provisions of New York law, including the state constitution, \nrecognize in a variety of contexts that the terms “corporation” and “association” \ncan – and do – overlap.  See, e.g., Const. Art. 10, § 4 (defining “corporations” \nunder §§ 1-4 of Article 10 of the state constitution to include certain \n“associations”); Coop. Corp. Law § 61 (referring to “associations, incorporated or \notherwise”); P’ship Law § 2 (defining “person” to include “corporations[] and other \nassociations”); Pub. Auths. Law § 1836-b(4) (referring to “corporation[s] or other \nassociation[s]”); see also Educ. Law § 1618; Gen. Oblig. Law § 5-521(1); Tax Law \n§ 1080(b)(2); Transp. Law § 2(11). \nLike the Third Department, the Fourth Department has interpreted § 296(4) \nto include public educational entities.  In State Division of Human Rights v. Board \nof Cooperative Educational Services (“BOCES”), the court rejected the argument \nthat the term “education corporation” refers exclusively to private entities.  98 \nA.D.2d 958, 958-59 (4th Dep’t 1983).  The court held that BOCES, a public \ninstitution, was “an education corporation organized and existing under section \n1950 of the Education Law, nonsectarian and exempt from real property taxes \nunder section 408 of the Real Property Tax Law[,]” and therefore subject to \n§ 296(4).  Id. at 958-959. \n17 \n\nIn its arguments below, the School District relied primarily on only one case \nto support its argument that the HRL does not protect students against \ndiscrimination and harassment in public schools: the nonbinding ruling in Matter \nof East Meadow Union Free School District v. New York State Division of Human \nRights, 65 A.D.3d 1342 (2d Dep’t 2009).  But amici respectfully submit that the \nreasoning in East Meadow is not persuasive and should be rejected.  In marked \ncontrast to the Third Department’s Ithaca City decision, the Second Department \ndid not acknowledge, much less fulfill, the HRL’s mandate of liberal construction, \nsee Exec. Law § 300, when it held that the term “education corporation” cannot \ninclude public school districts.9  Its decision omits any reference to that term’s \ndefinition in GCL § 66(6) and focuses instead on GCL § 65(c), which provides that \na “corporation formed other than for profit” shall be either an “education \ncorporation” or one of four other corporation types therein specified.  E. Meadow, \n65 A.D.3d at 1343.  The court interpreted this provision to mean that all education \ncorporations must be classified as “corporation[s] formed other than for profit” and \ntherefore cannot be “public corporation[s],” like school districts.  Id.  But this \nreasoning mistakenly assumes that if a given statement is true (e.g. all squares are \nrectangles), the converse must also be true (all rectangles are squares).  Nothing \nin New York law limits the term “education corporation” to private entities, and in \n                                           \n9Amici discuss the HRL’s liberal construction mandate in more detail in Section B, below.  \n18 \n\naddition to school districts, many public corporations are education corporations \nunder New York law, including:  \n•  boards of education; see Educ. Law §§ 1701, 1804;10 \n•  charter schools; see id.§ 2853(1)(a), (c);11 \n•  state universities; see id. § 352; \n•  public libraries; see id. § 255;12 \n•  the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation; see id. \n§ 652;13 and  \n•  boards of cooperative educational services. See BOCES, 98 A.D.2d at \n958-59. \nIndeed, the Second Department itself has recognized that the GCL’s \ndefinitions of “education corporation” and “municipal corporation” are not \nmutually exclusive, and it explained in a related context that “[w]hile there is \nauthority for the proposition that a public library is an ‘education corporation’, this \n                                           \n10See also Perrenod v. Liberty Bd. of Educ. for the Liberty Cent. Sch.

Jur. 2d Schools § 800. \n19 \n\ndoes not mean that it cannot also be a municipal corporation.”  Bovich v. E. \nMeadow Pub. Library, 16 A.D.3d 11, 17 (2d Dep’t 2005) (citations omitted).  \nSchool districts, as municipal corporations “formed under” the Education Law, fit \nthe definition of both “municipal corporation” and “education corporation.”  See \nGCL §§ 66(2) (“municipal corporation”), (6) (incorporating the definition of \n“education corporation” in Educ. Law § 216-a(1) (“‘education corporation’ . . .  \nmeans a corporation (a) chartered or incorporated by the regents or otherwise \nformed under this chapter”) (emphasis added)).  \nThe Second Department’s faulty logic reasoned that if public school districts \nare municipal “corporation[s],” they cannot also be “association[s]” – asserting that \na “corporation” and an “association” are necessarily “different things.”  E. \nMeadow, 65 A.D.3d at 1343.  But as explained above, other provisions of law \nmake clear that the two are not necessarily “different things,” and the two cases \ncited by the court in East Meadow do not support so sweeping a premise.  Rather, \none of those cases explains only that not all associations are incorporated. See In re \nEstate of Graves, 171 N.Y. 40, 47 (1902).  The other case explains that \nunincorporated associations are not corporations. See Martin v. Curran, 303 N.Y. \n276, 280 (1951).  Moreover, those cases do not control, because they did not \ninvolve the HRL and its express mandate of liberal construction.  See Exec. Law \n§ 300.   \n20 \n\nWhile other courts have not found it necessary to analyze the meaning of \n“education corporation or association,” their holdings reflect a consensus that the \nHRL protects students in public schools.  Federal courts in the Northern, Eastern \nand Southern Districts of New York have allowed discrimination claims brought \nby students under the HRL to proceed against public schools and their employees.  \nSee Miotto v. Yonkers Pub. Schs., 534 F. Supp. 2d 422, 429 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); \nHayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., 127 F. Supp. 2d 333, 340-41 (N.D.N.Y. 2000); \nMeehan v. Patchogue-Medford Sch. Dist., 29 F.

And it is telling that \nprior to East Meadow, the published decisions of state and federal courts that \nrejected § 296(4) claims against school districts and other public institutions did so \non other grounds and never held, or even suggested, that § 296(4) applies only to \nprivate organizations.14  See, e.g., Cave v. E. Meadow Union Free Sch. Dist., 480 \nF. Supp. 2d 610, 643 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), aff’d on other grounds, 514 F.3d 240, 250 \n(2d Cir. 2008); DT v. Somers Cent. Sch. Dist., 588 F.

Rensselaer Cnty., 57 A.D.3d 1069 (3d Dep’t \n                                           \n14 Subsequent to East Meadow and before Ithaca City, at least one federal court has expressed \nreservations about the correctness of East Meadow’s interpretation of § 296(4), but deferred to \nits conclusion in the absence of other appellate authority.  See Pratt v. Indian River Cent. Sch. \nDist., No. 7:09-cv-0411, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32596 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2011).  \n21 \n\n2008); Planck v. State Univ. of N.Y.

Ctr. of Brooklyn, 180 A.D.2d 606 (1st \nDep’t 1992). \nProperly construed, therefore, a public school district is an “education \ncorporation or association” subject to liability under the HRL for discrimination \nagainst, or permitting harassment of, its students.   \nB.  Excluding public school districts from § 296(4)’s reach would violate the \nrule of liberal construction, thwart the Human Rights Law’s purposes, \nand lead to absurd and unjust results. \nThe HRL’s strong policy against state-sponsored discrimination, its special \nconcern with protecting equal opportunity in education, its unusually broad and \ninclusive nature, and its explicit mandate of liberal construction would all be \nthwarted by interpreting § 296(4) to protect only the relatively few students who \nattend nonsectarian private schools from discrimination and harassment – leaving \npublic school students entirely without recourse to the Division of Human Rights.   \nThe HRL expressly mandates that courts construe its provisions “liberally \nfor the accomplishment of the [statute’s] purposes . . ..”  Exec. Law § 300.  The \nHRL’s purposes include “eliminat[ing] and prevent[ing] discrimination in . . . \neducational institutions,” id. § 290(3), and “eliminat[ing] . . . discrimination by the \nstate or any agency or subdivision of the state.”  Bd. of Higher Educ. of City of \nN.Y. v.

See, e.g., Cahill, 89 N.Y.2d at 20 (“Analysis starts \nby recognizing that the provisions of the [HRL] must be liberally construed to \naccomplish the purposes of the statute.” (emphasis added and citation omitted)); \nsee also Aurecchione v.

Consistent with these precedents, every \nDepartment of the Appellate Division has applied the rule of liberal construction in matters \ninvolving the HRL; the Second Department itself has done so in cases both pre-dating and post-\n23 \n\nThe HRL exists to “protect[] . . . the public welfare, health and peace of the \npeople of [the] state” and to “fulfill[] . . . the provisions of the constitution of this \nstate concerning civil rights.”  Exec.

Rights, 42 A.D.2d 49, 52 (2d \nDep’t 1973), aff’d, 35 N.Y.2d 673 (1974), the statute embodies the state’s \n“extremely strong” policy against discrimination.  See Batavia Lodge No. 196, \nLoyal Order of Moose v. N.Y. State Div. of Hum. Rights, 35 N.Y.2d 143, 146 \n(1974).  As this Court has recognized, discrimination is “all the more invidious . . . \nwhen it is practiced by the State.”  Koerner v. State, 62 N.Y.2d 442, 448 (1984); \nsee also Scheiber, 84 N.Y.2d at 125 (“The Human Rights Law effects this State’s \nfundamental public policy against discrimination by establishing equality of \nopportunity as a civil right.” (citations omitted)). \nEnding discrimination in education is at the heart of the HRL.  Its opening \nprovisions declare that the “opportunity to obtain education . . . without \ndiscrimination” is a “civil right[,]” and expressly describe the purposes of the law \nto include the “eliminat[ion] and prevent[ion of] discrimination in . . . educational \n                                                                                                                                        \ndating its ruling in East Meadow.

To carry out its strong \nanti-discriminatory purpose, the HRL employs broader and more inclusive \nlanguage than that found in other state and federal civil rights protections for \nstudents that are currently in effect.  In addition to barring discrimination in access \nto educational facilities, § 296(4) explicitly prohibits schools and universities from \n“permit[ting] the harassment of any student” based on “race, color, religion, \ndisability, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, age or marital \nstatus[.]”  Exec. Law § 296(4).  Student civil rights protections under federal law \ndo not enumerate as many prohibited bases of discrimination and do not expressly \nbar schools from “permit[ting] . . . harassment.”  See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et \nseq.; id. § 1400 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. § 794; 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. \nMany of the state’s laws, similarly, do not expressly address harassment, \nand/or their scope is limited to institutions of higher education.  See, e.g., Educ. \nLaw §§ 313, 3201, 3201-a, 4404.  The recently enacted Dignity for All Students \nAct is comprehensive and, by requiring schools to undertake specific actions to \naddress bullying, does expressly address harassment based on a broad range of \ntraits.16  But that law is not yet in effect and, while courts have not yet been called \n                                           \n16 The Dignity for All Students Act requires proactive measures by public school districts to \naddress discrimination and harassment based on – but not limited to – one’s actual or perceived \nrace, color, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious practice, disability, weight, \ngender or sex.  2010 N.Y. Laws 482 § 12.  Its enactment left other protections for students, such \nas the HRL, intact.  Id. at § 17 (providing that “nothing in [the Dignity for All Students Act] shall \n25 \n\nupon to address the vehicles for that law’s enforcement, the statute’s terms do not \nexpressly afford those complaining of violations with access to remedies through \nthe Division.  And as for other state statutory protections, courts have not \nrecognized a right to recover compensatory damages through a court action under \nseveral of them.17 \nIn any event, regardless of what other statutes provide, neither the School \nDistrict nor any court has explained why the legislature would enact a statute for \nthe express purposes of, inter alia, eliminating discrimination by the state and its \nsubdivisions and preventing discrimination in “educational institutions” and \n“public services,” and then drastically limit the statute’s protections to cover only \nstudents in certain private schools.18  As this Court has explained, the HRL is to be \ninterpreted so as “to spread its beneficial results as widely as possible[.]”  Rizzo, 6 \nN.Y.3d at 114 .   \n                                                                                                                                        \n. . .preclude or limit any right or cause of action provided under any local, state or federal \nordinance, law or regulation”).   \n17E.g., Educ. Law §§ 313, 3201, 3201-a. \n18Courts have long rejected the argument that nondiscrimination provisions in the Education Law \nsomehow divest the Division of Human Rights of jurisdiction to investigate and remedy HRL \nviolations.  See, e.g., N.Y. Univ. v. N.Y. State Div. of Human Rights, 84 Misc. 2d 702, 707 (Sup. \nCt. N.Y. Cnty. 1975) (holding that Education Department and Division of Human Rights had \nconcurrent jurisdiction, and observing that “‘[l]egislative enactments in this area have long \nevinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination’” \n(quoting Alexander v. Gardner Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47 (1974))); accord BOCES, 98 A.D.2d \nat 959. \n \n26 \n\nConstruing § 296(4) to exclude public schools would leave only two percent \nof the student population protected by the HRL, making its promise of equal \neducational opportunity an empty one for nearly all of the state’s youth.  See \nfootnotes 3 and 4, supra.  Such an interpretation would set New York apart as \nperhaps the only state that reserves its strongest school civil rights protections for a \nprivileged few of its children.  That is precisely the type of absurd and unjust result \nthat courts seek to avoid.  See, e.g., People v. Garson, 6 N.Y.3d 604, 614 (2006) \n(“[W]e must interpret a statute so as to avoid an unreasonable or absurd application \nof the law.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Braschi v. Stahl \nAssocs. Co., 74 N.Y.2d 201, 208 (1989) (“Statutes are ordinarily interpreted so as \nto avoid objectionable consequences and to prevent hardship or injustice[.]”); N. \nDutchess Rod & Gun Club, Inc. v. Town of Rhinebeck, 29 A.D.3d 587, 590 (2d \nDep’t 2006) (“[I]t is well-settled law that the words of a statute should not be \ninterpreted to achieve an absurd result[.]”); see also Stat. §§ 143, 145, 146. \nThe injustice that would result from adopting the School District’s \ninterpretation is even more apparent when one considers the enormous procedural \nand financial benefits of the HRL’s administrative enforcement mechanisms.  As \nthis Court noted in Freudenthal v. County of Nassau, 99 N.Y.2d 285 (2003), a \nproceeding before the Division is “designed to be affordable; it allows a \ncomplainant to avoid filing fees and other expenses related to commencement of a \n27 \n\ncivil action and facilitates prosecution of the claim without hiring an attorney.”   \nId. at 291.19  Indeed, the Division’s “user-friendliness” is readily apparent from its \nwebsite, which invites aggrieved parties to file complaints—without a filing fee or \nthe need for an attorney—through any regional office or by simply downloading an \nonline document and mailing the filled-out, notarized form to the agency.  See \nDivision, How To File a Complaint, http://www.dhr.state.ny.us/ \nhow_to_file_a_complaint.html (last visited October 18, 2011).  Investigative \nprocedures are similarly user-friendly, which may be especially important to young \npeople (and their parents) who may be having a first encounter with discrimination.  \nIn the course of investigating, the Division assumes the burden of notifying \nrespondents, may copy the complaint to other relevant agencies, can direct written \ninquiries, field investigation, or investigatory conferences, and, if probable cause is \ndetermined, will assign a Division attorney or agent to present the case in support \nof the complaint.  Freudenthal, 99 N.Y.2d at 290.  Obviously, these procedures \nand supports differ significantly from typical court processes. \n                                           \n19 In Freudenthal, this Court rejected the judicial imposition of procedural requirements on HRL \ncomplainants (specifically, the requirement to bring a notice of claim), noting that those types of \nprocedural requirements would be inconsistent “with the Legislature’s intent to provide \naggrieved parties a simplified alternative to litigation as a means to resolve discrimination \nclaims.”  Id. at 292. \n28 \n\n  A construction of the HRL that excludes public school districts would also \ndeny to public school students, and to the public at large,20 the benefit of having \ndiscrimination complaints involving school districts resolved by an agency with \nsignificant expertise and unique flexibility to craft appropriate remedies—remedies \nthat are unavailable through traditional litigation.  As this Court observed in \nFreudenthal, the Division has “decades of special experience in weighing the merit \nand value of [HRL] claims,” and the Commissioner of Human Rights has “greater \ndiscretion in effecting an appropriate remedy than under strict common-law \nprinciples[.]”  99 N.Y.2d at 290-91 (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted).   As a result, “the administrative forum offers a complainant remedies not \navailable from a court.”  Id. at 291 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAmong these remedies is the agency-run “conciliation” attempt that follows a \npreliminary finding of probable cause.  And as the Court further observed, \n“because conciliation efforts are an integral part of the administrative process, it \nprovides a unique vehicle – effective in some instances – to resolve claims \nexpeditiously.”  Id. \nNew York’s public school students have long benefited from the affordable, \naccessible, specially designed resources provided by the HRL and the executive \nagency that enforces it.  Reserving those resources solely for students receiving \n                                           \n20“A construction of a statute which tends to sacrifice or prejudice the public interests will be \navoided.” Stat. § 152. \n29 \n\nprivate non-religious education would diminish students’ rights and protections \nthroughout New York State, and would thwart, not serve, the HRL’s purposes. \n \nCONCLUSION \n  All of the relevant tools of statutory interpretation—the text of the HRL \nitself, the relevant case law interpreting and applying it, the state’s powerful policy \nagainst state-sponsored discrimination in education, and the many public and \nprivate interests served by making the resources of the Division of Human Rights \navailable to public school students—point to one conclusion:  Exec. Law § 296(4) \nprohibits discrimination by public school districts.  Respectfully, if this Court \ndetermines that this appeal’s resolution requires it to interpret that provision, it \nshould so hold. \n30 \n\nDated:  New York, New York \n  October 19, 2011 \n \nADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN OF NEW YORK, INC., \nANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE, DISABILITY \nADVOCATES, INC., EMPIRE STATE PRIDE AGENDA, \nGAY, LESBIAN & STRAIGHT EDUCATION NETWORK, \nITHACA LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER \nTASK FORCE, LAMBDA LEGAL DEFENSE AND \nEDUCATION FUND, INC., NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE \nAND EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC., NEW YORK CIVIL \nLIBERTIES UNION, AND PARENTS, FAMILIES AND \nFRIENDS OF LESBIANS AND GAYS \n \n \n  By:  ______________________________ \nThomas W.

Slip Op. 02604\nIn the Matter of North Syracuse Central School District, Respondent\nv\nNew York State Division of Human Rights, Appellant.\nSupreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, New York\nApril 1, 2011\nCITE TITLE AS: Matter of North Syracuse Cent. School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human\nRights\nHEADNOTE\nProceeding against Body or Officer\nProhibition\nWhen Available\nCaroline J. Downey, Bronx (Michael K. Swirsky of counsel), for respondent-appellant.\nLaw Offices of Frank W. Miller, East Syracuse (Frank W. Miller of counsel), for petitioner-respondent.\nAppeal from a resettled judgment (denominated order) of the Supreme Court, Onondaga County (Brian F.\nDeJoseph, J.), entered June 15, 2010 in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78. The resettled judgment\nprohibited respondent from taking further action on the complaint in New York State Division of Human Rights case\nNo. 10125491.\nIt is hereby ordered that the resettled judgment so appealed from is unanimously reversed on the law without costs\nand the petition is dismissed.\nMemorandum: In this CPLR article 78 proceeding, respondent appeals from a resettled judgment prohibiting it from\ntaking further action on a racial and disability discrimination complaint filed by the mother of one of petitioner's\nstudents. We agree with respondent that Supreme Court erred in granting the petition. We note at the outset that,\nalthough respondent appealed only from the original judgment, we may nevertheless review the resettled judgment\nin the absence of a new notice of appeal inasmuch as the resettled judgment “simply clarif[ies] the original . . .\njudgment for the purpose of correctly expressing the decision of” the court (Elda Dev. Corp. v Wall, 101 AD2d\n1000, 1001 [1984]).\nWith respect to the merits of the appeal, “[t]he Court of Appeals has held that a writ of prohibition is not an\nappropriate vehicle to be used to bar [respondent] from conducting an investigation because the ‘[r]emedy for\nasserted error of law in the exercise of [respondent's] jurisdiction or authority lies first in administrative review’ ”\n(Matter of Newfield Cent. School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human Rights, 66 AD3d 1314, 1315-1316\n[2009], quoting Matter of Tessy Plastics Corp. v State Div. of Human Rights, 47 NY2d 789, 791 [1979]). Thus,\nrespondent “ ‘has jurisdiction to investigate complaints of discrimination and any error of law in the exercise of that\njurisdiction must first be challenged by administrative review before judicial*1473 review pursuant to section 298 of\n\nthe Executive Law is available . . . The extraordinary writ of prohibition does not lie to challenge [respondent's]\ninitial acceptance of jurisdiction over a complaint of discrimination’ ” ( **2 Matter of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v State of\nN.Y., Exec. Dept., Div. of Human Rights, 41 AD3d 1276, 1276-1277 [2007], lv denied 9 NY3d 819\n[2008]; see Matter of Diocese of Rochester v New York State Div. of Human Rights, 305 AD2d 1000, 1001\n[2003]; Randy—The Salon v New York State Div. of Human Rights, 201 AD2d 901 [1994]). Consequently,\ninasmuch as petitioner failed to establish “ ‘futility of the administrative remedy; irreparable harm in the absence of\nprompt judicial intervention; or a claim of unconstitutional action’ ” (Newfield Cent. School Dist., 66 AD3d at\n1316), the court erred in prohibiting respondent from taking further action on the complaint.

In 2006,\nrespondent filed a complaint against petitioner with respondent State Division of Human Rights (hereinafter\nSDHR),  alleging  that  her  daughter,  while  a  student  at  one  [*2]of  petitioner's  middle  schools, was\nrepeatedly subjected to racial insults, racially-based threats and physical harm \"by a group of [Caucasian]\nboys who call themselves 'Red Necks.'\" The alleged incidents, most of which occurred on the school bus\nthat transported the children home at the end of the day, took place at various times from mid-September\n2005 until mid-December 2005, as well as in February 2006, when one of the boys on the bus held up a\nracially offensive sign. According to respondent, she repeatedly contacted school officials to complain about\nthe abuse and request help for her daughter, however, petitioner failed to meaningfully respond to the\nincidents, thereby permitting the harassment to persist.\nSDHR  investigated  the  complaint  and  referred  the  case  to  a  public  hearing,[FN1]  after  which an\nAdministrative Law Judge (hereinafter ALJ) found that the student misconduct alleged by respondent was\neither conceded by petitioner or otherwise proven. The ALJ further found that petitioner's response was\ndeficient, inconsistent and incompetent and, consequently, that petitioner had permitted the repeated racial\nharassment of respondent's daughter in violation of the Human Rights Law. The ALJ recommended that\npetitioner  pay  respondent  and  her  daughter  $500,000  each,  and  also  make  a  number of immediate\nchanges in administrative practices and training procedures to ameliorate the situation and prevent future\nviolations.  Thereafter,  the  Commissioner  of  Human  Rights  reduced  the  award  to  respondent and her\ndaughter to $200,000 each, but otherwise adopted the ALJ's recommendations.\nSubsequently, petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to Executive Law § 298, challenging SDHR's\njurisdiction  over  it,  as  a  public  school  district,  as  well  as  the  monetary  awards  and injunctive   relief.\nSupreme Court determined that SDHR lacked jurisdiction over petitioner, prompting SDHR and respondent\nto appeal.[FN2]\nSDHR  has  \"general  jurisdiction  and power\"   to,  among  other  things  \"eliminate  and [*3]prevent\ndiscrimination . . . in educational institutions\" (Executive Law § 290 [3]) and we are unpersuaded that\nanything in the statutory language of the Human Rights Law, or its legislative history, dictates the exclusion\nof public schools from that broad mandate. As relevant here, Executive Law § 296 (4) sets forth certain\nsubstantive provisions of the Human Rights Law that SDHR may enforce pursuant to its general jurisdiction.\nSpecifically,  that  statute  makes  it:  \"an  unlawful  discriminatory  practice  for  an education corporation or\nassociation which holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to\nthe provisions of article four of the real property tax law to . . . permit the harassment of any student or\napplicant, by reason of his [or her] race\" (Executive Law § 296 [4]).\nPetitioner contends that it is not subject to a claim of discrimination commenced against it pursuant to that\nprovision on the sole ground that it is not an \"education corporation or association.\"\nWhat  constitutes  an  \"education  corporation  or  association\"  is  not  defined  in  the  Human  Rights Law.\nAccordingly, relying on the determination of the Appellate Division, Second Department in Matter of East\n\nMeadow Union Free School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human Rights (65 AD3d 1342 [2009], lv denied\n14 NY3d 710 [2010]), petitioner urges this Court to look to the General Construction Law to supply the\nnecessary definitions. Petitioner argues that a strict reading of General Construction Law §§ 65 and 66\nleads to the conclusion reached by the Second Department that a public school district is not an \"education\ncorporation or association\" for purposes of the Human Rights Law and is, therefore, immune from claims\npursuant to Executive Law § 296 (4).\nWe  disagree.  Even  assuming, arguendo,   that  the  tortured  legislative  history  underlying General\nConstruction Law §§ 65 and 66 \" as well as various other statutes \" supports petitioner's argument that the\ndefinitions  of  \"education  corporation\"  and \"education   association\"  therein  do  not embrace public school\ndistricts, the fact remains that this does not, as petitioner contends, necessarily mean that these definitions\nare  applicable  to  Education  Law  §  296  (4).  The  approach  advocated  by  petitioner  completely ignores\nGeneral  Construction  Law  §  110,  which  provides  that  the  General  Construction  Law  is not intended to\nsupply a missing definition in a particular statute when the \"general object, or the context of the language\nconstrued, or other provisions of law indicate that a different meaning or application was intended from\nthat required to be given by [the General Construction Law].\" In that regard, we note that, as a remedial\nstatute, the Human Rights Law must be liberally construed to accomplish its beneficial purposes \" one of\nwhich is to eliminate discrimination in \"educational institutions\" (Executive Law §§ 290, 300) \" \"and to\nspread  its  beneficial  results  as  widely  as  possible\"  (Matter  of  Rizzo  v  New  York State Div. of Hous. &\nCommunity Renewal, 6 NY3d 104, 114 [2005]; see Matter of Crucible Materials Corp. v New York Power\nAuth., 50 AD3d 1353, 1355-1356 [2008], affd 13 NY3d 223 [2009]).\nTo adopt petitioner's premise that the General Construction Law definitions of \"educational corporation\" and\n\"educational association\" should be applied to Executive Law § 296 (4) would be to accept that, in enacting\nthe Human Rights Law, the Legislature intended to provide its protection against discrimination only to the\nrelatively  minuscule  percentage  of  students  whose  families  can  afford  to  send  them  to  private,  non-\nreligious  schools,  relegating  public  school  students  to  other  more  onerous  and/or less comprehensive\nremedies. In our view, [*4]such a result is so clearly contrary to the express purpose of the Human Rights\nLaw that resort to the General Construction Law definitions is inappropriate and unreasonable. Thus, we\nconclude  that  public  school  districts  are  among  the  \"educational  institutions\"  over  which SDHR has\njurisdiction and that Executive Law § 296 (4) is the statutory mechanism by which it can seek to eliminate\nany discrimination by such school districts.[FN3]\nIn light of our conclusion that petitioner is an entity subject to Executive Law § 296 (4), we next consider\nwhether SDHR's findings are supported by substantial evidence. As relevant herein, a violation of Executive\nLaw § 296 (4) occurs when a school district such as petitioner \"permit[s] the harassment of any student or\napplicant[] by reason of his [or her] race\" (Executive Law § 296 [4]). Upon our review, we conclude that\nSDHR's determination that petitioner \" which does not dispute that the majority of the alleged incidents\noccurred  \"  permitted  students  to  engage  in  a  course  of  racially-motivated  harassment of respondent's\ndaughter is supported by substantial evidence.\nSpecifically, the Commissioner confirmed the ALJ's finding that petitioner \"repeatedly chose a course of\naction which both put the interests of the white male perpetrators ahead of the interests of the black\n\nfemale student, and was repeatedly shown to be, and acknowledged to be, ineffective in stopping the\ndiscriminatory  conduct.\"  Ample  testimony  and  other  evidence,  including  a  videotape  of  one  of these\nincidents, supported respondent's allegations that her daughter was subjected to verbal and physical abuse\non the bus, including being spat upon, which was reported to the school. Nevertheless, petitioner's middle\nschool administrators routinely imposed only two to three-day suspensions on the offending students in\nresponse and testified that they felt it was \"unfair\" to move a problem student to another school to address\nthat student's conduct. The assistant principal conceded that there was a \"racial tidal wave\" that year, the\nschool  bus  that  respondent's  daughter  took  home  was  a  \"hell  hole\"  and he   knew  that  she had been\nthreatened  with  gun  violence.  However,  he  did  not  require  the  offenders  to  submit  to more serious\nsuperintendent's  hearings,  he  did  not  impose  lengthier  suspensions  and he   did  not  even  exercise his\nunilateral  power  to  ban  the  offenders  from  riding  on  that  particular  bus  [FN4].  Thus, according due\ndeference to SDHR's expertise in evaluating discrimination claims (see Matter of Price v Southwest Airlines,\nInc., 66 AD3d 1267, 1268 [2009], lv dismissed, 14 NY3d 858 [2010]; Matter of Matteo v New York State\nDiv. of Human Rights, 306 AD2d 484, 485 [2003]), we conclude that the finding of discrimination with\nrespect to respondent's daughter was supported by substantial evidence (see Matter of Anagnostakos v\nNew York State Div. of Human [*5]Rights, 46 AD3d 992, 993 [2007]).\nTurning next to the compensatory damage awards for the discriminatory conduct, we first address whether\nthe  award  of  $200,000  to  respondent's  daughter  is  appropriate.  The  mental  and  emotional pain and\nsuffering endured by this child as a result of the discrimination is more than amply demonstrated in this\nrecord. The proof established that she suffered significant mental anguish as a result of the racism that\npetitioner allowed to persist at her school and on her bus, which impacted negatively upon her grades, her\nsense of identity and her belief in her own physical well-being [FN5]. Respondent sought counseling and\nother  professional  mental  health  services  for  her  daughter  to  address  the  severe  impact  of these\nexperiences.  Under  the  circumstances,  we  find  that  the  $200,000  award  to  respondent's daughter is\nsupported by the evidence and effectuates the purposes of the Human Rights Law (see Human Rights Law\n§ 297 [4] [c]).\nWith  respect  to  the  propriety  of  the  separate  $200,000  award  to  respondent,  we  note  first our\ndisagreement with petitioner's contention that respondent is not entitled to an independent award because\nshe initiated the discrimination claim on behalf of her daughter as victim. Executive Law § 297 (9) provides\nthat \"[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice shall have a cause of\naction in any court of appropriate jurisdiction for damages.\" Here, an examination of the pleadings and\nproof reveals sufficient independent proof that respondent was aggrieved because of petitioner's conduct so\nas to justify an award of damages. For example, respondent testified as to her own hurt and anger when\nshe learned of the racial discrimination her daughter was experiencing. Respondent relayed that she had\nexperienced similar discrimination and abuse growing up and this motivated her to attempt to prevent her\ndaughter from being traumatized by it as well. She described how \"these things stay with you for the\nremainder  of  your  life  .  .  .  this  never  goes  away.\"  Respondent's  detailed  description  of  her largely\nunsuccessful and frustrating attempts to have petitioner's employees respond to her requests for help for\nher daughter were, as aptly described by the ALJ, a \"parent's nightmare.\" Accordingly, we find sufficient\n\nevidence to support a separate award to respondent. Nevertheless, given the comparatively sparse proof of\nemotional  distress  in  contrast  to  the  evidence  of  damages  experienced  by  her  daughter,  we  deem it\nappropriate to reduce the award of damages to respondent to $50,000 (see Matter of New York State\nDept. of Correctional Servs. v New York State Div. of Human Rights, 225 AD2d 856, 858-859 [1996];\nMatter of New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs. v State Div. of Human Rights, 207 AD2d 585, 585-\n586 [1994]).\nWe  also  conclude  that  the  injunctive  relief  ordered  by  SDHR  was  appropriate.  SDHR  issued  an order\nrequiring petitioner to provide anti-discrimination training to its staff, develop a new student disciplinary\ncode to avoid recurrences of discrimination and develop a \"community base[d] program to address the\nracial tensions in its schools.\" Such relief was within SDHR's broad authority to require the adoption of\nappropriate  measures  to  redress  injuries  and to   order  offenders  to  cease  discriminatory practices (see\nExecutive Law § 297 [4] [c]; Matter of [*6]Freudenthal v County of Nassau, 99 NY2d 285, 291 [2003]; see\nalso Executive Law § 290). Inasmuch as the injunctive relief was suitably tailored to the systemic nature of\nthe problem and the circumstances existing in the schools which permitted the discrimination to recur, we\nfind no basis to disturb it.\nPetitioner's remaining contentions have been examined and found to be unpersuasive.\nPeters, J.P., Spain and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. \nRose, J. (dissenting).\nWhile I am in complete agreement with the majority in all other respects, I disagree that a public school\ndistrict is an \"education corporation\" subject to Executive Law § 296 (4). Instead, a school district enjoys a\nunique status as a \"municipal corporation\" (see General Construction Law § 66 [2]), and the classification\nof corporations found in the General Construction Law persuades me that the Legislature did not intend\nExecutive Law § 296 (4) to apply to school districts (see General Construction Law § 65 [a] [1]; [b] [1];\n[c]  [2];  §  66  [6]).  As  noted  by  the  Second  Department,  these  statutory  classifications  of  \"municipal\ncorporation\" and \"education corporation\" are mutually exclusive, and school districts are not subject to\nExecutive Law § 296 (4) (see Matter of East Meadow Union Free School Dist. v New York State Div. of\nHuman Rights, 65 AD3d 1342, 1343 [2009], lv denied 14 NY3d 710 [2010]).[FN1]\nIn declining to apply the General Construction Law to Executive Law § 296 (4), the majority relies upon the\ngeneral purpose of the Human Rights Law to eliminate discrimination in \"educational institutions\" pursuant\nto Executive Law § 290, together with General Construction Law § 110, which provides that \"[t]his chapter\nis applicable to every statute unless its general object, or the context of the language construed, or other\nprovisions of law indicate that a different meaning or application was intended.\" While I certainly agree that\nthe Human Rights Law is to be construed liberally (see Executive Law § 300), \"even a remedial statute\nmust be given a meaning consistent with the words chosen by the Legislature\" (Enright v Eli Lilly & Co., 77\nNY2d 377, 385 n 1 [1991], cert denied 502 US 868 [1991]).\nThere is nothing within the general object or the language of Executive Law § 296 (4) to suggest that\n\nschool districts were intended to be included within the phrase \"an education corporation or association\nwhich  holds  itself  out  to  the  public  to  be  non-sectarian  and  exempt  from  taxation  pursuant  to the\nprovisions  of  article  4  of  the  real  property  tax  law\"  (Executive  Law  §  296  [4]).  To  the contrary, the\nrestrictive clause introduced by the relative pronoun \"which\" indicates that school districts are not included\nas, instead of holding themselves out to the public [*7]to be non-sectarian (implying that they have a\nchoice), they are constitutionally required to be non-sectarian (see NY Const, art XI, § 3). Further, there is\nnothing  within  Executive  Law  §  296,  or  elsewhere  in  the  Human  Rights  Law,  that  defines the term\n\"educational institution\" as used in Executive Law § 290 or suggests that it is meant to include school\ndistricts. Rather, the term is defined in the Education Law as \"any . . . institution of post-secondary grade\nsubject to the visitation, examination or inspection by the state board of regents or the state commissioner\nof  education  and any   business  or  trade  school  in  the  state\"  (Education  Law  §  313  [2] [a] [emphasis\nadded]). Had the Legislature intended to include school districts within the provisions of Executive Law §\n296 (4), it certainly knew how to do so (see e.g. Executive Law § 296 [15], [16]). In the absence of\nanything to preclude application of the General Construction Law, I would, upon our de novo review, grant\nthe petition, annul the determination and dismiss the administrative complaint.\nORDERED  that  the  order  is  vacated,  on  the  law,  without  costs;  petition  reinstated,  matter  deemed\ntransferred to this Court for de novo review, and, upon said review, determination modified, by reducing\nthe amount awarded for compensatory damages to respondent Amelia Kearney from $200,000 to $50,000;\nand, as so modified, confirmed. Footnotes \nFootnote 1:Petitioner's CPLR article 78 challenge to SDHR's authority to do so was unsuccessful. Although\nrespondents argue that petitioner waived any objection to jurisdiction because of certain actions taken by\npetitioner prior to the completion of the public hearing, we note that this Court previously held in Matter of\nNewfield Cent. School Dist. v New York State Div. of Human Rights (66 AD3d 1314, 1316 [2009]) that a\nchallenge to the applicability of Executive Law § 296 (4) to public school discrimination is appropriate after\na final determination by SDHR. \nFootnote 2:We note that Supreme Court erred in failing to transfer this proceeding challenging an order\nrendered  after  a  public  hearing  to  this  Court.  Unlike  CPLR  7804  (g),  Executive  Law  § 298 requires\nimmediate transfer to this Court without consideration of any threshold issues (see 22 NYCRR 202.57 [c];\nState Div. of Human Rights v YMCA of Greater N.Y., 139 AD2d 440, 441 [1988], lv denied 72 NY2d 807\n[1988]). Therefore, we deem it appropriate to vacate the order appealed from and review the matter de\nnovo (see State Div. of Human Rights v YMCA of Greater N.Y., 139 AD2d at 441). \nFootnote  3:In  our  view,  the  dissent's  reliance  on  the  definition  of  \"educational  institution\" set forth in\nEducation Law § 313 is misplaced. That statute clearly applies to unfair admissions and course enrollment\npractices as they relate to post-secondary schools. Since such practices would generally be irrelevant to\npublic primary and secondary schools, the purpose and ambit of Education Law § 313 render its provisions\nentirely inapposite to those of Executive Law § 296 (4). \n\nFootnote 4:Ironically, respondent's daughter testified that, at one point, it was she who was told to \"find\nanother way home\" by the bus driver after an incident during which she yelled back at her tormenters. \nFootnote  5:Respondent's  daughter  testified,  among  other  things,  that  the  taunting  caused  her  to feel\n\"worthless\" and ashamed of her race. Also, her fear over the threats of gun violence against her prompted\nher to sleep on the floor away from the windows. \nFootnote 1:This ruling by the Second Department, which the Court of Appeals has declined to review, has\nresulted in a troubling disparity in the application of the statute. In its brief, respondent State Division of\nHuman Rights advises that it no longer applies the statute within the Second Department while continuing\nto  process  complaints  against  public  school  districts  in  the  other  Departments, resulting in an unequal\napplication of the law.

Miller, for appellant.Michael K. Swirsky, for respondent.Cecilia C. Chang, for State of New York, amicus curiae.Advocates\nfor Children of New York, Inc. et al., amici curiae.Jonathan B. Fellows, for appellant.Raymond M. Schlather, for respondents Amelia\nKearney et al.\nAt issue on these appeals is whether a public school district is an “education corporation or association” as contemplated by Executive\nLaw § 296(4). We conclude that it is not, and, therefore, the New York State Division of Human Rights (“SDHR”) lacks jurisdiction to\ninvestigate complaints against public school districts under that provision.\nProcedural Background\nThe public school students in these proceedings filed complaints with the SDHR, claiming that their respective school districts\nengaged in an “unlawful discriminatory practice” under Article 15 of the Executive Law (Executive Law § 290, et seq., or the “Human\nRights Law”) by permitting their harassment on the basis of race and/or disability (Executive Law § 296[4] ).\nBoth school districts commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking a writ of prohibition barring the SDHR from investigating the\ncomplaints on the ground that a public school district is not an “education corporation or association” as contemplated by Executive\nLaw § 296(4). Supreme Court in Matter of North Syracuse Central School District granted the petition on that ground; Supreme\nCourt in Matter of Ithaca City School District held otherwise, concluding that a school district is an “education corporation” that the\nSDHR could investigate.\nAt this point, the procedural paths of the appeals diverged. The SDHR appealed in the North Syracuse Central School District matter,\nand the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, reversed, holding that the SDHR's exercise of jurisdiction should have been\nchallenged first during administrative review, not in a CPLR article 78 proceeding (83 A.D.3d 1472, 920 N.Y.S.2d 564 [4th Dept 2011]\n).\nThe Ithaca City School District then withdrew its appeal to the Appellate Division, Third Department. The parties proceeded to a\nhearing on the discrimination complaint before an administrative law judge, who concluded, among other things, that the district had\npermitted discriminatory conduct and awarded complainant and her mother $500,000 each. The Commissioner of Human Rights\nreduced each award to $200,000. The Ithaca City School District thereafter commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking\nvacatur and annulment of the SDHR's determination.\nSupreme Court annulled the SDHR's determination, holding that it lacked the authority to hear and determine complaints against the\ndistrict because a school district is not an “education corporation” under § 296(4). The Appellate Division, Third Department, with\none Justice dissenting, modified the mother's award by reducing it to $50,000 and otherwise confirmed the determination. Relying\non the legislative findings set forth in Executive Law § 290(3) that the Human Rights Law was intended “to eliminate and prevent\ndiscrimination   in educational institutions,” the Appellate Division held that “public school districts are among the ‘educational\n․\ninstitutions' over which [the SDHR] has jurisdiction and that Executive Law § 296(4) is the statutory mechanism by which it can seek\nto eliminate any discrimination by such school districts” (87 A.D.3d 268, 273, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686 [3d Dept 2011] ). This Court granted\nleave in both appeals.\nAnalysis\n\nExecutive Law § 296(4) provides, in relevant part, that “[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an education corporation\nor association which holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to   [RPTL article 4]   to\n․ ․\npermit the harassment of any student or applicant, by reason of his race   [or] disability  ” (emphasis supplied). The parties\n․ ․\nacknowledge that there is no definition of “education corporation or association” in the Human Rights Law.\nGiven the absence of a definition, one Appellate Division looked to the General Construction Law for guidance (see Matter of East\nMeadow Union Free School Dist. v. New York State Div. of Human Rights, 65 A.D.3d 1342, 1343, 886 N.Y.S.2d 211 [2d Dept 2009]\n[holding that because a school district is a “municipal corporation” and therefore a “public corporation” under the General\nConstruction Law, it could not be an “education corporation” within the meaning of Executive Law § 296(4) ] ). That approach is a\nlegitimate one given that the General Construction Law is “applicable to every statute unless its general object, or the context of the\nlanguage construed, or other provisions of law indicate that a different meaning or application was intended” (General Construction\nLaw § 110 [emphasis supplied] ). On the other hand, application of the General Construction Law is problematic, however, because\nthe provision at issue in the Executive Law was enacted 15 years prior to General Construction Law §§ 65 and 66—the provisions\nupon which the Appellate Division relied on in East Meadow Union Free School Dist .—and the SDHR, relying on the exceptions\ncontained in General Construction Law § 110, contends that the Legislature never meant for those definitions to apply to Executive\nLaw § 296(4). We need not address whether the General Construction Law is applicable here, however, because there is independent\nbasis, supported by legislative history, for our conclusion that a public school district is not an “education corporation or association.”\nThe SDHR asks this Court to adopt the Appellate Division's rationale in Matter of Ithaca City School Dist. and liberally construe the\n“general purpose” of the Human Rights Law, which is to “eliminate and prevent discrimination   in educational institutions”\n․\n(Executive Law § 290[3] ), and conclude that a public school district is an “educational corporation or association.” That argument,\nhowever, overlooks the basic premise that there must first be an underlying directive in the statute before this Court can apply such a\nconstruction. And it is evident from the legislative history that the term “education corporation or association,” the origins of which\ncan be traced to the Tax Law, refers to only private, non-sectarian entities that are exempt from taxation under RPTL article 4.\nThe demarcation between tax exemption for public and certain private property dates back to 1896, when the Legislature enacted Tax\nLaw § 4. That section expressly differentiated between the tax-exempt status for “[p]roperty of a municipal corporation of the state\nheld for public use  ” (Tax Law § 4 [3] ), i.e., school district property, from the tax-exempt status of\n․\n“[t]he real property of a corporation or association organized exclusively for the moral or mental improvement of men or women, or\nfor religious, bible, tract, charitable, benevolent, missionary, hospital, infirmary, educational, public playground, scientific, literary,\nbar association, library, patriotic, historical or cemetery purposes, or for the enforcement of laws relating to children or animals, or\ntwo or more such purposes and used exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more of such purposes  ” (Tax Law § 4[7]\n․\n[emphasis supplied] ).\nSubdivisions (3) and (7) of Tax Law § 4 plainly had different aims, with the latter addressing the tax-exempt status of private\nproperty ostensibly used to carry out a public purpose (see Poletti, New York State Constitutional Convention Committee of 1938, The\nProblems Relating to Taxation and Finance, at 198, 201–205). Indeed, the Legislature enacted Tax Law § 4(7) to prohibit the\ngranting of special real property tax exemptions to individual corporations, and to ensure that such corporations received such an\nexemption only if they used their property to provide a public service (id. at 201–205, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686 [emphasis supplied] ).\nIn 1935, the Legislature retained the language set forth in Tax Law § 4(7), renamed it Tax Law § 4(6), and added the following\nproviso: “No education corporation or association that holds itself out to the public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation\npursuant to provisions of this section shall deny the use of its facilities to any person otherwise qualified, by reason of his race, color\nor religion” (L 1935, ch 852 [emphasis supplied] ). The language was added after the Legislature received a report from the New York\nState Commission for the Revision of Tax Laws (“Tax Commission”), which, in part, addressed tax exemptions for government-\nowned and privately owned real property (1935 N.Y. Legis Doc No 62, at 35–59). The exemptions discussed in that report were\nembodied in Tax Law § 4 (id. at 40, n. 15, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686).\nIn its report, the Tax Commission observed that “[m]ost of the exemptions of privately owned real property result[ed] from the\n\nenumeration and definition of specific public uses,” meaning that tax exemptions for private property were granted because the\nexempt property was being “used in doing what the government might otherwise be compelled to do, in fulfilling a responsibility\nwhich it has definitely undertaken,” or, what the Legislature deemed a “necessary public purpose” (1935 N.Y. Legis Doc No 62, at 44).\nSignificantly, as relevant to this appeal, under the heading “Privately Owned Property Devoted to a Public Use,” the Tax Commission\nlisted a number of private entities referenced in now-former Tax Law § 4(6) (id. at 44–48, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686 [emphasis supplied] ).\nThe similarities between the types of privately-owned exempt property delineated in the Tax Commission's Report and Tax Law §\n4(6) are striking and hardly coincidental.\nFor instance, the Tax Commission, utilizing terms almost identical to those used in Tax Law § 4(6), listed as tax exempt the following\nprivate property owned by private organizations: religious property (“organized exclusively for religious, bible, tract, or missionary\npurposes, or for the moral or mental improvement of men or women”); charitable property (“owned by associations organized\nexclusively for charitable purposes”); fraternal and benevolent property (which “relieve[s] the state of part of its traditional burden of\ncaring for the poor, aged, and helpless”); hospital property (which “preserves” the public health, “one of the most important of the\nnecessary public purposes of the state”); occupational association property (property of “bar association” and use of county fair\ngrounds for agricultural exhibitions); and miscellaneous property (cemeteries and property owned by “patriotic” organizations)\n(compare Tax Law § 4[6] with 1935 N.Y. Legis Doc No 62 at 44–48).\nThe most significant item demarcated in the Tax Commission's list of private property subject to tax exemption was “educational\nproperty,” to which the Tax Commission devoted an entire section (1935 N.Y. Legis Doc No. 62 at 44). The Tax Commission noted\nthat “[r]eal property owned by educational institutions is exempt only to the extent that the educational purpose is ‘exclusively’\ncarried out ‘thereupon’ “, quoting from Tax Law § 4(6) that “real property of a corporation or association organized exclusively for \n․\neducational   purposes” is tax exempt if “used exclusively for carrying out thereupon” such a purpose (id. at 44, 926 N.Y.S.2d\n․\n686).1 Indeed, it was acknowledged after the enactment of Tax Law § 4(6) that “[w]ith the assumption by the public authority of the\nfunction of public education, the basis for the exemption of   non-profit making private institutions which carried an elementary and\n․\nsecondary educational work changed,” and the State “recognized that [such] institutions were performing not merely a desirable\npublic purpose but even a necessary one—a purpose that the government itself was serving” (New York State Constitutional\nConvention Committee of 1938, The Problems Relating to Taxation and Finance, vol 10 at 217 [emphasis in original] ). Because the\ngovernment derived a benefit from the work of these institutions, i.e., it was relieved of the expense of providing education to\nstudents of private institutions, “[t]he least that the public authority could do as a recompense of the institutions for the services they\nwere rendering and the money they were saving the authority was to free these institutions from taxation” (id.).\nGiven the foregoing, the “educational” property delineated in Tax Law § 4(6) plainly referred to privately owned property that was\ntax-exempt because it provided a public service; consequently, the use of the term “education corporation or association” in that\nsame provision plainly referred to private, non-sectarian entities that owned “educational” property utilized for a public purpose.\nAlthough the corporations and associations delineated in Tax Law § 4(6) provide different services, they share one thing in common:\ntheir property is privately owned and it is afforded tax-exempt status because those corporations or associations perform a public\nservice that the government recognizes as worthy of special tax treatment (1935 N.Y. Legis Doc No 62 at 44–48).\nIn light of the legislative history surrounding the enactment of Tax Law § 4(6), and given the circumstances under which the\nLegislature transferred the term “education corporation or association” from Tax Law § 4(6) to Executive Law § 296(4), we reject the\nSDHR's assertion that “education corporation or association” applies to a public school district. In 1951, the Legislature created the\nState Commission Against Discrimination2 to “eliminate and prevent discrimination in employment because of race, creed, color or\nnational origin” (L 1951, ch 800 [emphasis supplied] ). The following year the law was amended granting the State Commission the\nauthority to also “eliminate and prevent discrimination   in places of public accommodation, resort, or amusement” (L 1952, ch 285).\n․\nAs pertinent here, in 1958, the Legislature amended Executive Law § 296(4) as follows:\n“It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an education corporation or association which holds itself out to the public to be\nnon-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of   [RPTL article 4] to deny the use of its facilities to any persons\n․\notherwise qualified, by reason of his race, color or religion” (L 1958, ch 960 [emphasis supplied] ).\n\nThis language was taken almost verbatim from Tax Law § 4(6).\nThe term “education corporation or association” is retained in Executive Law § 296(4) to this day. The Human Rights Law is silent as\nto what constitutes an “education corporation or association,” but the fact that such language was taken directly from the Tax Law\nand moved to Executive Law § 296(4) bespeaks the Legislature's intention that the term was to have the same meaning in the\nExecutive Law as it did in former Tax Law § 4(6). Moreover, the use of the phrase “non-sectarian” was plainly included in Executive\nLaw § 296(4) to carve out an exception for parochial schools, while reserving for the SDHR the jurisdiction to investigate § 296(4)\ncomplaints against private, non-sectarian education corporations or associations.\nPublic school districts are different from private, non-sectarian institutions and fall outside the purview of the SDHR's jurisdiction\nrelative to § 296(4) claims. To be sure, school districts own tax-exempt property and serve a public purpose, but they do so as part of\na public system, not a private one. And a public school district receives tax-exempt status by virtue of the fact that it is public, so\nthere would never be any need for it to “hold[ ] itself out to the public to be non-sectarian” as, say, a private school.\nThe vicious attacks to which these students were subjected are deplorable, and our holding is not to be interpreted as indifference to\ntheir plight, since the merits of their underlying discrimination claims are not at issue on these appeals. Nor does our holding leave\npublic school students without a remedy. In addition to potential remedies under federal law, public school students may file a\ncomplaint with the Commissioner of Education (see Education Law § 310). Moreover, in 2010, the Legislature enacted the “Dignity\nfor All Students Act,” establishing article 2 of the Education Law, designed “to afford all [public school] students an environment free\nof any harassment that substantially interferes with their education, regardless of the basis of the harassment, and free of\ndiscrimination based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, disability, sexual orientation,\ngender, or sex” (Sponsor's Mem, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 482; see also Education Law §§ 10–18 eff July 1, 2012). Although the SDHR\nlauded this legislation by acknowledging that it “addresses a myriad of harassment and discrimination issues that arise within a\nschool context and its goals comport with the goals of the [Human Rights Law],” noticeably absent from its correspondence was any\nindication that it had previously handled similar claims of that nature arising in public schools (Letter from New York State Div. of\nHuman Rights, July 22, 2010, at 33, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 482).\nConclusion\nBecause a public school district is not an “education corporation or association” under Executive Law § 296(4), the SDHR lacked\njurisdiction to investigate the complaints filed by the students in these appeals.3\nAccordingly, in Matter of North Syracuse Central School District, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs,\nand the resettled judgment of Supreme Court reinstated. In Matter of Ithaca City School District, the order of the Appellate Division\nshould be reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court reinstated.\n \nCiparick, J. (dissenting) \nThe equal protection clause of the New York State Constitution explicitly prohibits both public and private discrimination (see N.Y.\nConst, art I, § 11). Legislation implementing this provision states “[t]he opportunity to obtain education   without discrimination   is \n․ ․ ․\nrecognized as and declared to be a civil right” (Executive Law § 291[2] ). Further, Executive law § 296(4) provides that\n“[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an education corporation or association which holds itself out to the public to be\nnon-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of article four of the real property tax law to deny the use of its\nfacilities to any person otherwise qualified, or to permit the harassment of any student or applicant, by reason of his race, color,\nreligion, disability, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, age or marital status.”\nToday, the majority curtails the breadth of this statute by limiting the definition of “education corporation or association” to only\nprivate schools and exempting public school districts from the jurisdiction of the State Division of Human Rights (SDHR). Because I\nbelieve that exclusion of public school children from the full protection of the Human Rights Law contradicts the plain language of\nthe statute, the Legislature's declared purpose and New York's fundamental public policy against discrimination, I respectfully\ndissent.\n\nI.\nIthaca City School District\nDuring the 2005–2006 school year, petitioner's daughter [E.K.], a 12–year–old African American student attending public school in\nIthaca, was repeatedly subjected to racial insults, threats and physical harm from a group of white male students. Among other\nthings, the boys made comments to E.K. such as: “Do you mind if I call you my nigger?” and “we shoot niggers like you in the woods.”\nOne student told E.K. that he had a hunting rifle with her name on it. The majority of the incidents occurred on the school bus.\nPetitioner repeatedly sought help from school officials. Despite acknowledging that there was a “racial tidal wave” at the school and\nthat E.K.'s school bus was a “hell hole,” officials only meted out ineffective one or two day suspensions on the perpetrators and\nrefused to ban the offending students from the school bus.\nBecause of the harassment, E.K.'s grades fell and her mental health deteriorated. Petitioner filed a complaint with SDHR. After a\npublic hearing before an administrative law judge, it was determined that the school district had violated Executive Law § 296(4) by\npermitting the repeated harassment of a student on the basis of race. Specifically, the division found that the school district\n“repeatedly chose a course of action which both put the interests of the white male perpetrators ahead of the interests of the black\nfemale student, and was repeatedly shown to be, and acknowledged to be, ineffective in stopping the discriminatory conduct.” The\nadministrative law judge ordered the school district to pay compensatory damages to E.K. and her mother in the amount of\n$500,000 each. The SDHR affirmed the findings, but lowered both damage awards to $200,000. The school district challenged the\ndetermination. Supreme Court determined that the SDHR lacked jurisdiction to investigate public schools. The Appellate Division\nreversed holding that the SDHR did indeed have jurisdiction over public schools (see Matter of Ithaca City School Dist. v. New York\nState Div. of Human Rights, 87 A.D.3d 268, 926 N.Y.S.2d 686 [3d Dept 2011] ).\nNorth Syracuse Central School District\nThe underlying complaint in this case was filed by the mother of a 14–year–old African American student [L.T.], who attended public\nschool in North Syracuse. The mother complained that her child was targeted for abuse because of her race and had been called\nnames such as “gorilla” and “fat black bitch.” SDHR investigated and interviewed school officials who confirmed that L.T. had been\ntargeted by bullies but that the harassment was based on personal hygiene and weight as opposed to race and that the terms “gorilla”\nand “fat black bitch” were not “race based insults.” The SDHR found probable cause to support a violation of Executive Law § 296(4)\nand ordered a full public hearing on the issue. The school district filed an article 78 petition in Supreme Court challenging the\nSDHR's jurisdiction. Supreme Court granted the petition, finding that the SDHR had no jurisdiction over the school district. The\nAppellate Division reversed, holding that the school district was required to exhaust its administrative remedies, including raising its\njurisdictional challenge to the SDHR prior to commencing an article 78 proceeding (Matter of North Syracuse Cent. School Dist. v.\nNew York State Div. of Human Rights, 83 A.D.3d 1472, 920 N.Y.S.2d 564 [4th Dept 2011] ).1\nII.\nThe majority has determined, through an analysis of tax law statutory history, that the term “educational corporation or association,”\nas used in Executive Law § 296(4), is intended to cover only private schools and accordingly provide protection for a very small\npercentage of students in the state. However, such an interpretation is contradicted by a plain reading of the statute, which we have\nlong recognized as the clearest indication of legislative intent (see Majewski v. Broadalbin–Perth Cent. School Dist., 91 N.Y.2d 577,\n583 [1998] ). Executive Law § 296(4) prohibits discrimination by any “education corporation or association which holds itself out to\nthe public to be non-sectarian and exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of article four of the real property tax law.” It is\nuncontroverted that the term “education corporation or association” is not defined within the Executive Law. It is beyond cavil that\npublic school districts are corporations organized for educational purposes (see N.Y. Const, art X, § 5) and public schools hold\nthemselves out to the public as non-sectarian and are exempt from taxation pursuant to article 4 of the RPTL (see RPTL 408).\nSection 296(4) brings within the protection of the Human Rights Law private educational institutions, which had not previously been\ncovered. That it used identical language, as the RPTL, does not work to now exclude public school districts. Thus, a plain reading of\nthe statute indicates that the Legislature intended to confer authority to SDHR over both public and private schools and the historical\n\nstatutory analysis performed by the majority runs counter to the plain language of the statute.2\nMoreover, in interpreting the statute, we also examine the purpose of a statute in determining legislative intent (see Matter of Sutka\nv. Conners, 73 N.Y.2d 395, 403 [1989] ). Interpreting section 296(4) as encompassing both public and private schools is in keeping\nwith the overarching purpose of article 15 of the Executive law—the Human Rights Law—which is:\n“to assure that every individual within this state is afforded an equal opportunity to enjoy a full and productive life and that the\nfailure to provide such equal opportunity, whether because of discrimination, prejudice, intolerance or inadequate education,\ntraining, housing or health care not only threatens the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants but menaces the institutions and\nfoundation of a free democratic state and threatens the peace, order, health, safety and general welfare of the state and its\ninhabitants” (Executive Law § 290[3] [emphasis added] ).\nThis statute also provides for the creation of the SDHR in order to\n“encourage programs designed to insure that every individual shall have an equal opportunity to participate fully in the economic,\ncultural and intellectual life of the state; to encourage and promote the development and execution by all persons within the state of\nsuch state programs; to eliminate and prevent discrimination in employment, in places of public accommodation, resort or\namusement, in educational institutions, in public services, in housing accommodations, in commercial space and in credit\ntransactions and to take other actions against discrimination as herein provided; and the division established hereunder is hereby\ngiven general jurisdiction and power for such purposes” (id. [emphasis added] ).\nThis language clearly indicates that “every individual”—including every school age child—has a right to adequate education and that\nthe SDHR has the authority, on behalf of “every individual,” to prevent discrimination in “educational institutions.”3 The majority's\nlimitation of the SDHR's jurisdiction to only private schools does little to promote the broad purposes of the Human Rights Law,\nwhich is to provide a bias free education for every individual.\nFurthermore, by its own statutory language, “the provisions [of the Human Rights Law] shall be construed liberally for the\naccomplishment of the purposes thereof” (Executive Law § 300) and we have consistently embraced a liberal construction of the\nHuman Rights Law in order to accomplish its stated purpose (see Matter of Cahill v. Rosa, 89 N.Y.2d 14, 20 [1996] [holding that a\nprivate dentist's office is a place of public accommodation] ). By adopting a strict and limiting interpretation of the statute, the\nmajority is forgoing its duty to make sure that the Human Rights Law is implemented in such a way as to give every individual an\nopportunity for a bias free education (see City of Schenectady v. State Div. of Human Rights, 37 N.Y.2d 421, 428 [1975] [“it is the\nduty of courts to make sure that the Human Rights Law works and that the intent of the Legislature is not thwarted by a combination\nof strict construction of the statute and a battle with semantics”] ). It is antithetical to the purpose of the Human Rights Law to\nexempt public schools from its mandate. We have noted that discrimination is “all the more invidious” when practiced by state run\nentities (Koerner v. State of N.Y., Pilgrim Psychiatric Ctr., 62 N.Y.2d 442, 448 [1984] ). The clear and expressed intent of the Human\nRights Law is to protect “every individual” in the State from the evils of discrimination. As argued by the State, nothing in the text of\nthe Human Rights Law compels a reading, as that employed by the majority, that would exclude public school districts from the\ncoverage of section 296(4) and its remedial purpose. It is implausible that the Legislature intended to exempt public schools and the\nthousands of children who attend these schools from the protection of the Human Rights Law and the oversight of the SDHR.\nThus, I would affirm both Appellate Division orders.\nFor Case No. 109: Order reversed, with costs, and resettled judgment of Supreme Court, Onondaga County, reinstated.\nFor Case No. 110: Order reversed, with costs, and order of Supreme Court, Tompkins County, reinstated.\nPIGOTT, J.\nJudges GRAFFEO, READ and SMITH concur. Judge CIPARICK dissents and votes to affirm in an opinion in which Chief Judge\nLIPPMAN and Judge JONES concur.\n\n",

      "title": "Sharply Divided New York Court of Appeals Rules Human Rights Law Does Not Apply to Student Discrimination Claims Against Public Schools",
      "text": "Sharply Divided New York Court of Appeals Rules Human Rights Law Does Not Apply to\nStudent Discrimination Claims Against Public Schools\nThe New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled 4-3 on June 12, 2012, that Section 296(4) of the N.Y. Executive Law, a\nprovision of the state's Human Rights Law, which bans discrimination in the use of its facilities by an \"education corporation or association,\"\ndoes not apply to the public schools of the state.  North Syracuse Central School District v. N.Y.S. Division of Human Rights, 2012 WL\n2092954.  One practical impact of the decision is that public school students suffering discrimination will have to bring their complaints to\nfederal education authorities or the state education department.  Another, unspoken in the opinion, is that public school students suffering\nsexual orientation discrimination (a category of discrimination expressly covered under state law but not under federal law) will be left to\nresort to constitutional litigation, denied an administrative forum for their claims.\nAccording to the opinion for the court by Judge Eugene F. Pigott, Jr., the legislature's intention in using this phrase, which is not defined\nin the statute, was to take its meaning from the Real Property Tax Law, which first used it in 1896 to describe real property tax\nexemptions for private schools, and which, as amended in 1935, provided that a private school that held itself out to the public as \"non-\nsectarian and exempt from tax\" could not \"deny the use of its facilities to any person otherwise qualified, by reason of his race, color or\nreligion.\"  Public school property is, of course, government property, and thus automatically exempt from real estate taxes, but the 1896\nenactment was intended to extend the tax exemption to private schools.  The 1935 amendment to the Tax Law, says the court, was\nintended to impose a non-discrimination requirement on those tax exempt private schools that were non-sectarian.  (Religious schools are\nexempted from the non-discrimination requirement, at least as far as the real estate tax requirements go.)\nThe court's decision concerns appeals in two cases that were consolidated for hearing, arising from allegations of racial harassment by\nAfrican-American students attending public schools in Syracuse and Ithaca.  When the students filed complaints with the State Division of\nHuman Rights (SDHR), the schools took the position that the SDHR lacked jurisdiction over the matter.  In the Ithaca case, the Appellate\nDivision, 3rd Department, upheld an award of damages to the complainant.  In the Syracuse case, in which the school district affirmatively\nsued to block an SDHR investigation of the complaint, the Appellate Division, 4th Department, held that the district could not bring suit\ndirectly, but had to raise its jurisdictional argument as a defense in appealing a decision of the SDHR.\nJudge Pigott's decision provides a detailed history of the tax law provision, which clearly deals with the issue of property tax exemption for\nprivate schools, and then pointed out that the language used in the Human Rights Law \"was taken almost verbatim from Tax Law Sec.\n4(6).  The term 'education corporation or association' is retained in Executive Law sec. 296(4) to this day.  The Human Rights Law is silent\nas to what constitutes an 'education corporation or association,' but the fact that such language was taken directly from the Tax Law and\nmove to Executive Law sec. 296(4) bespeaks the Legislature's intention that the term was to have the same meaning in the Executive Law\nas it did in former Tax Law sec. 4(6).  Moreover, the use of the phrase 'non-sectarian' was plainly included in Executive Law sec. 296(4) to\ncarve out an exception for parochial schools, while reserving for the SDHR the jurisdiction to investigate sec. 296(4) complaints against\nprivate, non-sectarian education corporations or associations.\"\nJudge Pigott also premised his ruling on differences between governmentally-operated schools and private schools.  \"The vicious attacks to\nwhich these students were subjected are deplorable,\" he wrote, \"and our holding is not to be interpreted as indifference to their plight,\nsince the merits of their underlying discrimination claims are not at issue on these appeals.  Nor does our holding leave public school\nstudents without a remedy.  In addition to potential remedies under federal law, public school students may file a complaint with the\nCommissioner of Education.\"  Pigott also pointed out the recent enactment of the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA), without mentioning\nits lack of a private right of action by students for individual harassment claims.  DASA is intended to require schools to adopt anti-\nharassment policies and implement appropriate training.\nDissenting, Judge Carmen Ciparick argued that \"the exclusion of public school children from the full protection of the Human Rights Law\ncontradicts the plain language of the statute, the Legislature's declared purpose and New York's fundamental public policy against\ndiscrimination.\"  She pointed out that the phrase \"education corporation or association\" is not defined in the Human Rights Law, but\nobserved: \"It is beyond cavil that public school district are corporations organized for education purposes and public schools hold\nthemselves out to the public as non-sectarian and are exempt from taxation pursuant to article 4 of the RPTL [Real Property Tax Law]. \nSection 296(4) brings within the protection of the Human Rights Law private educational institutions, which had not previously been\ncovered. That it used identical language, as the RPTL, does not work to now exclude public school districts.  Thus, a plain reading of the\nstatute indicates that the Legislature intended to confer authority to SDHR over both public and private schools and the historical statutory\nanalysis performed by the majority runs counter to the plain language of the statute.\"\nShe also observes that the statement of legislative purpose in the Human Rights Law supports a broad jurisdictional reading, noting that\nthe purposes articulated in the statute itself included \"to assure that every individual with this state is afforded an equal opportunity to\n\nenjoy a full and productive life and that the failure to provide such equal opportunity, whether because of discrimination, prejudice,\nintolerance or inadequate education, training, housing or health care not only threatens the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants\nbut menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state and threatens the peace, order, health, safety and general welfare\nof the state and its inhabitants.\"  She further notes that the provision establishing the SDHR and describing the \"places of public\naccommodations\" to which its jurisdiction extends uses the phrase \"educational institutions\" rather than the phrase \"education corporations\nor associations,\" clearly signaling, in her view, a broader reach to all eduational institutions, not just private schools.\n\"This language clearly indicates that 'every individual' - including every school age child - has a right to adequate education and that the\nSDHR has the authority, on behalf of 'every individual,' to prevent discrimination in 'educational institutions.'  The majority's limitation fo\nthe SDHR's jurisdiction to only private schools does little to promote the broad purposes of the Human Rights Law, which is to provide a\nbias free education for every individual.\"  She also noted the specific provision of the statute providing for liberal construction \"for the\naccomplishment of the purposes thereof.\" \nConcluded Ciparick, \"It is antithetical to the purpose of the Human Rights Law to exempt public schools from its mandate. . .  It is\nimplausible that the Legislature intended to exempt public schools and the thousands of children who attend these schools from the\nprotection of the Human Rights Law and the oversight of the SDHR.\"\nAlthough the cases arose from racial harassment complaints, the court's ruling is particularly harmful to LGBT students.  Students with race\ndiscrimination claims can clearly take them to the U.S. Department of Education, which has jurisdiction to address claims of racial\nharassment in public schools that receive federal financial assistances -- which is pretty much all of them.  But federal law\ndoes not expressly cover claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation by educational institutions, which are covered by the New\nYork Human Rights Law.  (Federal law does cover sex discrimination claims, and there is some authority that gender identity claims may\ncome within the sex discrimination coverage; at least, several federal courts have accepted the argument that gender identity\ndiscrimination is sex discrimination, as did the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in a recent jurisdictional ruling under Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.) \nMichael K. Swirsky, an appellate attorney for the Division of Human Rights, argued the case in the Court of Appeals on behalf of the\nagency, with amicus curiae participation by Cecilia C. Chang for the Attorney General.  Amicus briefs were filed by Advocates for Children\nof New York, Inc. (lead amicus party for a dozen organizations concerned with children's rights, civil rights, LGBT rights, including Lambda\nLegal), and the New York State School Boards Association (arguing that public schools were not subject to the Human Rights Law).  The\nNorth Syracuse Central School District was represented by Frank w. Miller; the Ithaca City School District by Jonathan B. Fellows.",
