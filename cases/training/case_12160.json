Earlier that month, UC YAL initiated on-campus signature gathering in order to put a certain amendment on the ballot. The process was delayed due to the University's policies, which subjected on-campus speech to a prior notice and permit scheme, and designated limited space for expressive activities. UC YAL, represented by public interest attorneys, sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. It claimed that the University's speech policies violated its First Amendment rights. UC YAL further claimed that the University's policies were unconstitutionally vague and subject to arbitrary enforcement. </p><p>On June 12, 2012, the District Court (Judge Timothy S. Black) granted in part UC YAL's motion for a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the University from enforcing certain notice and location requirements of its free speech policies as applied to students, while denying the University's motion for summary judgment. Univ. of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty v. Williams, 2012 WL 2160969 (S.D. Ohio June 12, 2012). On the same day, UC YAL filed its second amended complaint. The University revised relevant part of its policies subsequently. </p><p>On August 22, 2012, Judge Black granted a University's employee's motion to dismiss the claims against her in her individual capacity, for UC YAL failed to bring a plausible claim for relief. Univ. of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty v. Williams, 2012 WL 3637315 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 22, 2012). On the same day, Judge Black granted UC YAL's unopposed motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent one. Univ. of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty v. Williams, 2012 WL 3636932 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 22, 2012). The Court also found the revised policies were in accordance with the preliminary injunction order. </p><p>On October 1, 2012, the parties settled the rest of the lawsuit and filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the case, with the Court retaining jurisdiction over the case for the purpose of enforcing the settlement. The terms of this settlement do not appear to have been made public. This ended the suit. </p>",

      "text": "Case: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 1 of 19  PAGEID #: 1400\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nWESTERN DIVISION\nUNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI  Case No. 1:12-cv-155\nCHAPTER OF YOUNG AMERICANS \nFOR LIBERTY, et al.,  Judge Timothy S. Black\nPlaintiffs\nv.\nGREGORY WILLIAMS, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER GRANTING IN PART \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, \nENJOINING ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN NOTICE AND LOCATION\nREQUIREMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI’S \nFREE SPEECH POLICIES AS APPLIED TO STUDENTS\nThis civil case presents the question, among others, as to whether the University of\nCincinnati, a public university, may constitutionally subject speech on its campus, by both\nstudents and outsiders alike, to a prior notice and permit scheme and restrict all\n“demonstrations, picketing, and rallies” to a Free Speech Area which constitutes less that\n0.1% of the grounds of the campus.  For the reasons stated here, the Court determines that\nsuch a scheme violates the First Amendment and cannot stand. \nAs a threshold matter, and as the Supreme Court of the United States has clearly\nstated:  “It is offensive – not only to the values protected by the First Amendment, but to\nthe very notion of a free society – that in the context of everyday public discourse a\ncitizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then\nobtain a permit to do so.”  Watchtower Bible and Tract Soc’y of NY, Inc. v. Vill. of\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 2 of 19  PAGEID #: 1401\nStratton, 536 U.S. 150, 165-66 (2002).  Moreover, the precedents of the Supreme Court\n“leave no room for the view that, because of the acknowledged need for order, First\nAmendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the\ncommunity at large.  Quite to the contrary, the vigilant protection of constitutional\nfreedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.”  Healy v.\nJames, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972) (internal citations omitted).  Indeed, according to the\nSupreme Court, “the college classroom and its environs is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of\nideas,” id., and “[n]either students [n]or teachers shed their constitutional rights to\nfreedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”  Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\nCmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969).  While universities surely have a right to\nregulate use of their property, they must do so narrowly and the mere “undifferentiated\nfear or apprehension of a disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of\nexpression on a college campus.”  Healy, 408 U.S. at 191.\nHere, what prompted this lawsuit was the University of Cincinnati’s determination\nthat students members of the UC Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty were denied\nthe right to circulate freely across the college campus seeking to gather signatures on\npetitions to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the November 2012\nballot.  Instead, the students were advised that they could only gather signatures within\nthe McMicken Commons Northwest Corner (which UC designates as the Free Speech\nArea and is less than one tenth the size of a football field), and if any signature gathering\nwere to occur anywhere else on the campus, the students would be subject to arrest.  \n-2-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 3 of 19  PAGEID #: 1402\nAfter complying with this directive, Plaintiffs assert that in one day of work they\nmanaged to gather only one signature and were only able to interact with six students as a\nresult of the low pedestrian traffic in and adjacent to the Free Speech Area.  This lawsuit\nfollowed.\nPlaintiffs claim that the University’s prohibition against any and all spontaneous\nstudent speech anywhere on campus, i.e., speech in the absence of adherence to UC’s five\nto 15 day notification requirements and prior permission, is overbroad and facially\nunconstitutional.  Plaintiffs argue that the unconstitutionality of this prior restraint is\nenhanced by the vague terms the University uses to assess the length of the applicable\nnotification requirement and the vesting of immense sole discretion in untrained low-level\npersons for determining how speech is to be classified. According to Plaintiffs, the\nunconstitutionality of this vagueness and discretion is enhanced by their coupling with\nprior restraints on all student speech on campus.  Moreover, by burdening all student\nspeech, rather than just disruptive or crowd-gathering speech, Plaintiffs assert that the\nUniversity’s combined speech policies are not narrowly tailored to achieve the regulatory\ninterests that the University asserts (e.g., public order and safety) . \nThe University responds that it “has an interest in regulating ALL expressive\nactivity on its campus” and therefore is permitted to limit all expressive activities, bound\nonly by reasonableness.  To reach this conclusion, and thereby avoid strict scrutiny, the\nUniversity has unilaterally declared that its entire campus is a limited public forum.\n-3-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 4 of 19  PAGEID #: 1403\n ANALYSIS\nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction prohibiting the University from enforcing\nits free speech policies on the grounds that the policies act as an unconstitutional prior\nrestraint, are unconstitutionally vague, and allow arbitrary application by government\nofficials. (See Doc. 5 at 7).  Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ motion and seek summary\njudgment upholding the constitutionality of the old policies.  (See Docs. 42 & 44).1 \n1   Before resolving the merits of the motions, the Court must address Defendants’ threshold\nobjection that its modification of the policies after the lawsuit was filed renders Plaintiffs’ claims moot\nand precludes the Court from deciding the case.  \n     “An actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is\nfiled.”  Ariz. for Official English v. Ariz., 520 U.S. 43, 67 (1997) (internal citations omitted).  Federal\ncourts have “no authority to render a decision upon moot questions.”  Campbell v. PMI Food Equip. Grp,\nInc., 509 F.3d 776, 781 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotations omitted).   However, “a defendant’s voluntary\ncessation of allegedly unlawful conduct ordinarily does not suffice to moot a case.” Ohio Citizen Action\nv. City of Englewood, 671 F.3d 564, 583 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Envt’l\nServs., 528 U.S. 167, 174 (2000)) (emphasis supplied).  Instead, Defendants bear “the formidable burden\nof showing that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\nexpected to recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  \n     Here, Defendants have not met their burden.  While Defendants cite President Williams’s affidavit\nthat the old policies will not be reenacted as evidence that they cannot reasonably be expected to recur,\nthe University’s statement is insufficient to preclude jurisdiction.  (See Doc. 54 at 14).  The\nGovernment’s abandonment of the challenged practice is “an important factor bearing on the question of\nwhether a court should exercise its power to enjoin the defendant from renewing the practice, but that is a\nmatter relating to the exercise rather than the existence of judicial power.”  City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s\nCastle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982) (emphasis supplied).  \n     Further, a new policy that disadvantages Plaintiffs in the same fundamental way as the old one, albeit\nto a possible lesser degree, does not moot the case.  Courts should look to the “gravamen of petitioner’s\ncomplaint.”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656,\n662 (1993).  Here, the “gravamen” of Plaintiffs’ free speech claim is that the University policies impose\nan unconstitutional prior restraint on expressive activity.  (See Doc. 15 at ¶¶ 90-91).  The new policies\nmay impose shorter notice requirements, but they still harm Plaintiffs in the same fundamental way by\nimposing a notice requirement for all student speech on campus. As in Northeast Florida, the Court need\nnot speculate whether the Defendants will return to the allegedly wrongful conduct because they already\nhave in the form of the new policy.\n    With respect to the due process claim, Plaintiffs’ central complaint is that the policies are so vague as\nto deny fair notice of the conduct subject to the regulation and to provide university officials with\nunbridled discretion.  (Doc. 15 at ¶¶ 95-101).  The Defendants assert that because the revised policies\n-4-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 5 of 19  PAGEID #: 1404\n            Federal district courts balance the following factors in addressing motions for a\npreliminary injunction: “(1) the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits;  \n(2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm without the injunction; (3) the\nprobability that granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and          \n(4) whether the public interest will be advanced by issuing the injunction.”  Miller v.\nCincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 533 (6th Cir. 2010).  \n             Plaintiffs allege that the University’s policies impose an unconstitutional prior\nrestraint on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.  Courts use a three-part test to\nevaluate a First Amendment claim:  (1) whether the speech is protected; (2) the nature of\nthe forum where the speech is to occur and the proper standard for restrictions in that\nforum; and (3) whether the government justification satisfies the applicable standard.\nCornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 797 (1985).  \ninclude definitions of the challenged terms, the due process claims are now moot.  (Doc. 54 at 24). \nHowever, Defendants may not “insulate themselves from liability by simply amending the regulation.” \nStephenson v. Davenport Cmty Sch. Dist., 110 F.3d 1303, 1308 (8th Cir. 1997) (emphasis supplied). \nFurther, the presence of Plaintiffs’ nominal damages claim preserves jurisdiction.  Miller v. Cincinnati,\n622 F.3d 524, 533 (6th Cir. 2010).  \n     Finally, the timing of the University’s changes leaves this Court with no assurance that the challenged\nconduct will not be re-implemented, absent an injunction, at the conclusion of this litigation.  See DeJohn\nv. Temple Univ., 537 F.3d 301, 309 (3d Cir. 2008).  Despite previous complaints regarding its policies,\nthe University did not amend its regulations until after the commencement of this litigation and only a\nfew weeks before the scheduled final injunction hearing.  Additionally, the University continues to\ndefend the constitutionality of its former policy.  These two factors are significant in determining\nwhether there is a reasonable expectation that the challenged conduct may recur. Id.; see also Parents\nInvolved in Cmty Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 719 (2007); (holding that voluntary\ncessation in response to litigation does not satisfy the heavy burden to demonstrate that the challenged\nconduct cannot reasonably be expected to occur).  \n     Accordingly, Defendants’ voluntary cessation of the challenged policy does not render Plaintiffs’\nclaims moot and the Court retains jurisdiction.\n-5-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 6 of 19  PAGEID #: 1405\n               As to the first element, “[t]he solicitation of signatures for a petition involves\nprotected speech.”  Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 422 n. 5 (1988).   This type of speech\nis “at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms – an area of\npublic policy where protection of robust discussion is at its zenith.”  Id. at 425 (internal\ncitations omitted).  Obviously, core political speech, like petition signature gathering, is\n“protected speech.” Plaintiffs have therefore satisfied the first element of the free speech\nclaim. \n               Because the speech at issue is clearly protected, the Court next turns to the\nnature of the forum.  Courts use “forum analysis as a means of determining when the\nGovernment’s interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose outweighs\nthe interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes.”  Cornelius, 473 U.S.\nat 800.  \n              There are three types of public forum: (1) the traditional public forum, made up\nof parks, sidewalks, and other areas that “by tradition or government fiat” are available\nfor public use and discussion; (2) the designated public forum, where the government\nopens a piece of state property to the public at large, treating it as if it were a traditional\npublic forum even it does not fall into the precise parameters of tradition; and (3) the\nlimited public forum, which is created by the government for use by certain groups or\nlimited to solely to the discussion of certain topics.   Miller, 622 F.3d at 534-535.  In\ncontrast, a nonpublic forum is government property that by tradition or usage is not a\nforum for public discussion. Id.  \n-6-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 7 of 19  PAGEID #: 1406\nThe forum analysis is crucial because while regulations on speech in traditional\nand designated public fora are subject to strict scrutiny and must serve a compelling\ninterest and be most narrowly drawn, in a limited public forum, the government may\nrestrict speech so long as the regulations are viewpoint neutral and merely reasonable in\nlight of the purpose served by the forum.  Id. \nIn examining whether property constitutes a public forum, the Supreme Court has\nmade it clear that “the First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply\nbecause it is owned or controlled by the government.”   Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local\nEducators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983) (internal citations omitted).  Nevertheless, the\nSupreme Court has also declared that “the campus of a public university, at least for its\nstudents, possesses many of the characteristics of a public forum.”  Widmar v. Vincent,\n454 U.S. 263, 268 n.5 (1981).  The Court must therefore analyze each piece of the\nUniversity’s property to which the student speakers seek access rather than simply the\ncampus as a whole.  See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 801.  \nIn determining the nature of the forum, courts look to the traditional use of the\nproperty, the objective use and purposes of the space, the government intent and policy\nwith respect to the property, and its physical characteristics and location.  Id. at 802;\nBowman v. White, 444 F.3d 967, 978 (8th Cir. 2006).  \nPlaintiffs assert that the northwest corner of McMicken Commons, designated by\nthe University as the “Free Speech Area,” constitutes a traditional public forum.  (Doc. 43\n-7-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 8 of 19  PAGEID #: 1407\nat 11).  The Defendants contend that it, along with all other campus areas, is a limited\npublic forum.  (Doc. 44 at 16).  \nThe Free Speech Area is a grassy open space between slant walks measuring\napproximately 4,537 square feet on the University’s West Campus.  (Doc. 62, Ex. 1 at 3).\nIt comprises approximately .01% of the entire campus.  (Doc. 15 at  ¶ 37).  The\nUniversity contends that the area is a limited public forum.\nWhile the policy establishes the University’s subjective intent to make the open\ncampus areas limited public fora and to restrict access to outsiders, the objective criteria\ndemonstrate that the University has traditionally made the Free Speech Area available to\nstudents as a designated public forum.  The University’s Use of Facilities Policy Manual\ndeclares that the northwest corner of McMicken Commons is “designated as the main free\nspeech area” and that “demonstrations, picketing and rallies” may take place only in that\narea.  (Doc. 15, Ex. A at 14).  Further, it is the policy of the University that “if a request is\nmade in compliance with the notice requirement and for a University location available to\nthe expressive activity, the request is to be honored.”  (Doc. 43, Ex. 1 at 7).  \nBecause the property has traditionally been open for speech and debate by\nstudents, and because the University grants students access to the Free Speech Area as a\nmatter of course, the University has made the Free Speech Area a designated public\nforum as to students.  See Perry, 460 U.S. at 48 (holding that evidence that access to the\nforum was granted as a matter of course would establish the creation of a public forum).  \n-8-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 9 of 19  PAGEID #: 1408\nIn seeking to avoid this finding by the Court, Defendants rely on the Sixth\nCircuit’s decision in Gilles v. Garland to support their proposition that open areas on\npublic university campuses are limited public fora.  (See Doc. 44 at 14 (citing 281 Fed.\nApp’x 501, 511 (6th Cir. 2008))).  In Gilles, the court upheld the right of Miami\nUniversity to designate its open campus areas as a limited public forum with respect to an\noutside evangelist who sought to preach on campus.  Gilles, 281 Fed. App’x at 511. \nHowever, recent decisions by the Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit call into question\nwhether Gilles is still valid authority.  The Gilles court treated the terms “limited public\nforum” and “designated public forum” interchangeably.  See Gilles, 281 Fed. App’x at\n509 (“The second type of forum has been alternatively described as a “limited public\nforum,” ... and as a “designated public forum.””).  But the Supreme Court has\nsubsequently clarified that designated public fora and limited public fora are distinct\ntypes, subject to differing standards of scrutiny.  See Pleasant Grove City, Utah v.\nSummum, 555 U.S. 460, 469 (2009).  This Pleasant Grove decision “resolves the\nconfusion over terminology and scrutiny levels” created by the Sixth Circuit’s earlier\ndecisions, and diminishes the value of Gilles’ holding that open campus spaces of public\nuniversities are limited public fora.  Miller, 622 F.3d at 535, n.1.  Indeed, the Sixth\nCircuit’s most recent decision on the matter holds that such spaces are more appropriately\nconsidered designated public fora.  See McGlone v. Bell, --F.3d.--, 2012 WL 1403233,\n*11 (6th Cir. Apr. 23, 2012) (holding that the open areas of Tennessee Technical\nUniversity’s campus are designated public fora); see also Hays Cnty Guardian v. Supple,\n-9-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 10 of 19  PAGEID #: 1409\n969 F.2d 111, 116 (5th Cir. 1992 (holding that the university campus is a designated\npublic forum)).\nFurther, Gilles concerned the University’s restriction of an external constituent\nwho was unable to obtain sponsorship from a campus student organization.  Gilles, 281\nFed. App’x at 502.  Gilles does not suggest, nor is this Court aware of any other precedent\nestablishing, that a public university may constitutionally designate its entire campus as a\nlimited public forum as applied to students.  \nDefendants’ view would allow the university to restrict the speech of all students\nto limited topics, subject only to a reasonableness review.  Such a theory is an anathema\nto the nature of a university, which is “peculiarly the marketplace of ideas” and runs\ncontrary to the Supreme Court’s holding that “the vigilant protection of constitutional\nfreedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.”  Healy, 408\nU.S. at 180 (1972); see also Pro-Life Cougars v. Univ. of Houston, 259 F. Supp. 2d 575,\n582 (S.D. Tex. 2003) (holding that the university and plaza “are public fora designated\nfor student speech”); Univ. and Cmty. Coll. Sys. of Nev. v. Nev. for Sound Gov’t, 100 P.3d\n179, 190 (Nev. 2004) (“Typically, when reviewing restrictions placed on students’ speech\nactivities, courts have found university campuses to be designated public forums.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court determines that the Free Speech Area is a designated public forum\nwith respect to the University’s internal constituents.  \n-10-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 11 of 19  PAGEID #: 1410\nIn addition to the Free Speech Area, Plaintiffs seek access to outdoor spaces on the\nMainStreet area of campus.2  (Doc. 43 at 12).  “MainStreet is the pedestrian corridor” that\nruns through campus and “is the hub of campus activity.”  (Doc. 43, Ex. 3 at 2).  The\nUniversity now provides in its new policies that these areas “may be used for student\nspeech if the University’s reasonable notice requirements are met.”  (Doc. 42, Ex. 2 at 4). \nAs with the Free Speech Area, “if a request is made in compliance with the notice\nrequirement and for a University location available to the expressive activity, the request\nis to be honored.”  (Doc. 43, Ex. 1 at 7).  \nTherefore, the Court finds that by virtue of the University’s opening of the above\nareas for student speech they became designated public fora as applied to students.  See\nPerry, 460 U.S. at 48 (holding that evidence that access to the forum was granted as a\nmatter of course would establish the creation of a public forum).  \n           Plaintiff also asks the Court to rule that otherwise undesignated University streets,\nsidewalks, and open areas are also designated public fora as to students.  (Doc. 43 at 17). \nIn response, the Court finds that while the University may exclude those without a\nlegitimate purpose from interior sidewalks and public exterior spaces, such locations\nremain designated public fora as to students.  Justice For All v. Faulkner, 410 F.3d 760,\n2  These spaces include the Tangeman University Center Plaza, Bearcat Pavilion, Bearcat\nPlaza, McMicken Free Speech Area, McMicken Commons, Sigma Sigma Commons, Campus\nGreen, Campus Recreation Center West Plaza, and Campus Recreation Center East Plaza. (Doc.\n43 at 12; Doc. 43, Ex. 3 at 4).  \n-11-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 12 of 19  PAGEID #: 1411\n769 (5th Cir. 2005) (“[O]utdoor areas of [a university’s] campus generally accessible to\nstudents such as plazas and sidewalks” are “public forums for student speech.”).\n            Speech restrictions in both traditional and designated public fora, i.e., here, the\nFree Speech Area and the campus open areas, plazas and sidewalks, are subject to strict\nscrutiny, and the government may only exclude a speaker if necessary to serve a\ncompelling government interest and only if the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve\nthat interest.  Miller, 622 F.3d at 534.   However, the “government may impose\nreasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the\nrestrictions are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they\nare narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open\nample alternative channels for communication of the information.” Ward v. Rock Against\nRacism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).  \nPlaintiffs assert that the University’s notice policy is overbroad and serves as an\nimpermissible prior restraint.  (Doc. 43 at 36).  A prior restraint is any government\nrestriction that vests an administrative official with discretionary power to control in\nadvance the use of public places for First Amendment Activities.  Kunz v. People of the\nState of N.Y., 340 U.S. 290, 293-294.  Prior restraints bear a heavy burden of\nunconstitutionality.  FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 225 (1990).  To pass\nconstitutional muster, a permitting scheme must leave relatively little discretion in the\nhands of public officials regarding whether to grant or deny a permit.  Id. at 225-226.\n-12-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 13 of 19  PAGEID #: 1412\nHere, the mere fact that the notice requirement applies to all student speech raises\nconstitutional concerns.  Under the terms of the University’s original policy, students are\nrequired to give a minimum of five working days (and perhaps 10 working days) notice\nfor any speech that is a “demonstration, picketing, or rally.”  (Doc. 15, Ex. A at 15).  Yet,\nas stated at the outset:  “It is offensive – not only to the values protected by the First\nAmendment, but to the very notion of a free society – that in the context of everyday\npublic discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her\nneighbors and then obtain a permit to do so.”  Watchtower, 536 U.S. at 165-66.  Such\nexpansive permitting schemes place an objective burden on the exercise of free speech. \nId.  Further, they essentially ban spontaneous speech.  Id.  \nHere, while the “breadth and unprecedented nature of this regulation does not\nalone render [it] invalid,” it is indicative of the University’s failure to narrowly tailor the\nregulation to serve a compelling interest.  Id. at 166.  And in identifying a compelling\ninterest, the University cannot simply assert interests that are important in the abstract. \nTurner Broad Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994).  Mere speculation that speech\nwould disrupt campus activities is insufficient because “undifferentiated fear or\napprehension of a disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of\nexpression on a college campus.”  Healy, 408 U.S. at 191. \nThe University asserts that it maintains the notice requirements to enable it to do\nwhat is necessary for activities to take place under peaceful and safe conditions.  (Doc. 42\n-13-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 14 of 19  PAGEID #: 1413\nat 25).3  Indeed there may be some speech, such as particularly large protests or rallies,\nthat requires the University to take security or logistical steps to ensure the safety and\norder of campus.  But here the University does not restrict its regulation to large\ndemonstrations, or those using sound amplification, or any number of potentially\njustifiable criteria.4  Rather, the University paints with a broad brush to encompass all\nspeech that may be classified as a “demonstration, picket, or rally” and has failed to\nnarrowly tailor its policy.  Such a restriction simply cannot be justified on the basis the\nUniversity asserts.5   \n3  At least one other Ohio public university has been able to satisfy similar interests with\nnothing more than an anti-disruption policy.  See Wright State Faculty Handbook, Regulation of\nTime, Place and Manner (“Any individual or group may use, without prior notification, on any\nday of the week during daylight hours, any publicly accessible outdoor area of the University's\nDayton and Lake campuses to collect signatures, distribute materials, and/or speak, as long as\nthey do not disrupt the functioning of the University. Academic departments, programs and other\nunits and registered student organizations may schedule University space to bring speakers and\nprograms of their choice to the Dayton and Lake campuses on a space available basis. Such\nspeakers shall have the same access to the University facilities as their sponsor. This Policy is not\napplicable to situations arising within the context of normal classroom instruction and\ndiscussion.”), available at http://admit.wright.edu/academics/fhandbook/demo_march.html.\n4  See, e.g., Roberts v. Haragan, 346 F. Supp. 2d 853, 870, n. 20 (N.D. Tex. 2004) (noting\nthat a policy requiring prior notification for events “expected to draw a crowed of than 25 people\nwould implicate a university’s interests in controlling large gatherings that might disrupt classes,\nblock building access, or create traffic hazards.  Permission for activities near intersections or\nduring certain hours in close proximity to academic buildings might also be justified by a\nsignificant University interest in assuring safety or an environment conducive to study or\nteaching.”); Ward, 491 U.S. at 801 (upholding a city’s right to regulate sound amplification in a\npublic forum).   \n5   The Court notes that while the original policy required prior notification for\n“demonstrations, picketing, and rallies,” the new policy applies even more broadly, requiring a\nminimum of three working days for any “expressive activity,” which the University defines as\n“any exercise of the right to free speech (See Doc. 44, Ex. 1 at 3-4).  Although a challenge to the\nterms of the University’s revised policies is not yet before the Court, such a policy will not likely\nsurvive strict scrutiny.  It is simply unfathomable that a UC student needs to give the University\nadvance notice of an intent to gather signature for a ballot initiative.  There is no danger to public\norder arising out students walking around campus with clipboards seeking signatures.\n-14-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 15 of 19  PAGEID #: 1414\nTherefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have established a significant likelihood\nof success on their claim that the University’s requirement that all speakers give five to 15\ndays of advance notification to the University is facially unconstitutional.  The Use of\nFacilities Policy Manual additionally restricts all “demonstrations, picketing, and rallies”\nto the Free Speech Zone, without defining those terms.  (Doc. 15, Ex. A at 15).  Plaintiffs\ncontend that the University has failed to provide a compelling interest justifying the\nexclusion of those activities from other designated public fora.  (Doc. 5 at 21).  In\nresponse, the University argues that the entire campus is a limited public forum, and that\nits location requirements are reasonable.  (Doc. 44 at 26).  \nHowever, the Court has determined that other open areas of campus constitute\ndesignated public fora, not limited public fora, and the University has simply offered no\nexplanation of its compelling interest in restricting all demonstrations, rallies, and protests\nfrom all but one designated public forum on campus.  Consequently, the Court finds that\nPlaintiffs have established a significant likelihood of success on their claims that the\nUniversity’s location requirements unconstitutionally burden their right to free speech. \n            Plaintiffs also allege that the University’s original policies violate their right to\ndue process because the policies were unconstitutionally vague and provided University\nofficials with unbridled discretion in determining what constitutes a “demonstration,\npicket, or rally” subject to the requirement that they speak only in the Free Speech Area\nand comply with a lengthier notice requirement.  (Doc. 15 at 24).  \n-15-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 16 of 19  PAGEID #: 1415\nIn pursuing a void for vagueness claim, a plaintiff must establish that “a\nregulation’s prohibitive terms are not clearly defined such that a reasonable person of\nordinary intelligence can readily identify the applicable standard for inclusion and\nexclusion.”  Miller, 622 F.3d at 539 (internal citations omitted).  The doctrine ensures that\nlaws provide “fair warning” of impermissible conduct and protect citizens against\n“impermissible delegation of basic policy matters for resolution on an ad hoc and\nsubjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.” \nId.  Consequently, a statute that fails to constrain an official’s decision to limit speech\nwith objective criteria is unconstitutionally vague.  Id.  \nIn this case, the University’s original policies impose a requirement that all\n“demonstrations, picketing, and rallies” may take place only in the Free Speech Area and\nmust give a minimum of ten working days notice to the University Police, but the policies\ndo not define those terms.6  (See Doc. 15, Ex. A at 15).  The University did not provide\nany written criteria for determining whether an expressive activity constitutes a\ndemonstration, picket, or rally, and instead relied on University employees’ “use of the\nword as it is commonly understood by persons of ordinary intelligence.”  (Doc. 54 at 26).\nWhile the University contends that the solicitation of signatures does not fall into this\ndefinition, the Campus Scheduling employees who reviewed Morbitzer’s request assigned\nhim to the area designated for such speech.  The fact that the University and its own\n6   The Court notes that the University’s newly revised policies do provide definitions for\nsome of the challenged terms.  (See Doc. 44, Ex. 1).\n-16-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 17 of 19  PAGEID #: 1416\nemployees have different understandings of the terms demonstrates the clear confusion\narising from the unconstitutionally vague terms of the policies.\nPlaintiffs further contend that the notice periods governing campus speech activity\nby students are also unconstitutionally vague.  The Use of Facilities Policy Manual\nrequires “anyone requesting to demonstrate, picket or rally must give prior notice of ten\n(10) working days to University Police.”  (See Doc. 15, Ex. A at 15).  The MainStreet\nEvent guide, however, states that “all requests must be received no later than five\nbusiness days before the requested date” and lists the Free Speech Area as a space subject\nto these regulations.  (See Doc. 43, Ex. 3 at 4, 11).  Further complicating matters, the Use\nof Facilities Policy Manual also requires ten days notice for speeches “requiring security,”\nwhile the MainStreet Event Guide states that “[f]or events that require security and\ngrounds, a minimum of 15 days before the requested date is required.”  (Doc. 15, Ex. 1 at\n12; Doc. 43, Ex. 3 at 11).  On their face, both policies purport to apply to the Free Speech\nArea, and yet impose different requirements.  Further, the policies provide no criteria for\ndetermining whether an event “requires security.” \nBecause the original policy fails to provide criteria regarding what constitutes a\n“demonstration, rally, or picket” or an event “requiring security,” imposes seemingly\ncontradictory notice requirements, and presents university officials with the opportunity\nfor arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, the Court would be compelled to find the\npolicy unconstitutionally vague on its face.  \n-17-\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 65 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 18 of 19  PAGEID #: 1417\nThus, Plaintiffs have evidenced a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of\ntheir claims, the first requirement for issuance of a preliminary injunction.7\nMoreover, it appears that there is little dispute on the remaining elements of the\npreliminary injunction test.  As Sixth Circuit has repeatedly held, “even minimal\ninfringement upon First Amendment values constitutes irreparable injury sufficient to\njustify injunctive relief.” Miller, 622 F.3d at 540 (6th Cir. 2010); Newsom v. Norris, 888\nF.2d 371, 378 (6th Cir. 1989).  “When a constitutional violation is likely, moreover, the\npublic interest militates in favor of injunctive relief because ‘it is always in the public\ninterest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.’” Miller, 622 F.3d at 540\n(quoting Connection Distrib.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nWESTERN DIVISION\nUNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI  Case No. 1:12-cv-155\nCHAPTER OF YOUNG AMERICANS \nFOR LIBERTY, et al., \nPlaintiffs, Judge Timothy S. Black\nv.\nGREGORY WILLIAMS, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO CONVERT THE\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION INTO A PERMANENT INJUNCTION (DOC. 71)\nPlaintiffs filed the instant action on February 22, 2012, alleging that the University\nof Cincinnati’s policies regulating student speech violated the First Amendment.  On June\n12, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, finding that the\nFree Speech Area and the open outdoor areas of campus were designated public fora and\nthat the University’s policies failed to satisfy the requirements of strict scrutiny.  (See\nDoc. 65).  The Court enjoined the Defendants1 from enforcing its unconstitutional\npolicies, and ordered them to craft more narrowly tailored regulations. (Id.).  \nOn July 12, 2012, Defendants notified the Court that they had adopted the\nfollowing revised free speech policy:\n1   Plaintiffs’ Complaint sought injunctive relief against University President Gregory\nWilliams, Program Director of Conference and Event Services Corinn Shemak, Public Safety\nand Special Events Coordinator Cathy Krumpelbeck, Campus Director of Public Safety Michael\nCureton, and Conference & Event Services student employee Brittany Sisko.  (Doc. 15). \nPlaintiffs also sought damages against Defendant Sisko in her individual capacity.\n\n         “Effective as of June 12, 2012, the University of Cincinnati’s Expressive Activity\nPolicy is suspended by court order, as is any regulation of student speech found in\nthe Use of Facilities Policy Manual and the Main Street Student Event Guide.  The\npresident of the University has directed as follows:\n• Students who wish to engage in any expressive activity in groups of 25 or\nfewer, including soliciting signatures on petitions, may do so, without any\nprior notice to the university, in the Free Speech Area and the open campus\nareas, plazas, and sidewalks. \n• Students who wish to engage in any expressive activity in groups of more\nthan 25: (a) are asked to call Campus Scheduling (558-1810) at least 24\nhours in advance and (b) may conduct activities in the same locations,\nexcept that the university reserves the ability, on a case-by-case basis, to\nchange the location of a very large activity (groups of 5,000 or more), but\nonly to the extent necessary to ensure the safety and security of the\nuniversity community.  \n• Students engaging in any activity on campus are to adhere to the student\ncode of conduct and always to acquit themselves in accordance with\napplicable law.”  (Doc. 81 at 1-2).  \nThe Court finds that the University’s revised policy is in accordance with the prior\nOrder, and the Court anticipates that the revised policies will continue in effect. \nPlaintiffs subsequently filed a motion seeking to convert the preliminary injunction\ninto a permanent injunction (Doc. 71).  Defendants respond that while they “respectfully\ndisagree with this Court’s June 12, 2012 preliminary injunction and reserve appellate\nrights regarding the merits, they do not oppose Plaintiffs’ motion to convert the\npreliminary injunction to a permanent injunction, provided the scope of the permanent\ninjunction mirrors the scope of the preliminary injunction.”  (Id. at 1).  \n-2-\n\nIn the absence of opposition from the Defendants, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Convert\nthe Preliminary Injunction to a Permanent Injunction is GRANTED.  Accordingly, for\nthe reasons stated in the Court’s June 12, 2012 Order (Doc. 65), the Court again\nORDERS, now permanently, that:\n(1) The Free Speech Area, the outdoor spaces described in the MainStreet\nEvent Guide,2 and campus sidewalks are designated public fora;\n(2) Any restrictions on student speech in the above-designated public fora must\nbe narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  The\nUniversity may impose content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions\nif those restrictions do not burden substantially more speech than necessary\nto serve a compelling University interest;\n(3) Defendants are hereby ENJOINED from: \n(A)  Requiring prior notification for the solicitation by students of\nsignatures of petitions;\n(B) Prohibiting all solicitation by students of signatures of petitions in\nany designated public forum, including the Free Speech Area, the\noutdoor spaces described in the MainStreet Event Guide, and campus\nsidewalks;\n(C) Requiring that all student “demonstrations, picketing, or rallies”\noccur only in the Free Speech Area and/or McMicken Commons and\nNorthwest McMicken Commons;\n(D) Requiring five to 15 days prior notification for any and all student\n“demonstrations, picketing, or rallies” – without differentiations.\n2 These spaces include the Tangeman University Center Plaza, Bearcat Pavilion, Bearcat\nPlaza, McMicken Free Speech Area, McMicken Commons, Sigma Sigma Commons, Campus\nGreen, Campus Recreation Center West Plaza, and Campus Recreation Center East Plaza.\n(Doc. 43 at 12; Doc. 43, Ex. 3 at 4).\n-3-\n\n(E) Imposing or enforcing any policy restricting student speech in any\ndesignated public forum, including the Free Speech Area, the\noutdoor spaces described in the MainStreet Event Guide, and campus\nsidewalks that is not individually and narrowly tailored to serve a\ncompelling University interest.\n(4) Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2), Plaintiffs shall file their motion for\nattorneys’ fees within 14 days of the date of this Order.  Defendants shall\nfile their memorandum in opposition within 21 days of Plaintiffs’ filing;\nand\n(5) The Court shall rule on Defendants’ Motion for Mediation and Related\nRelief (Doc. 75) after Plaintiffs’ anticipated motion for fees is fully ripe. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDate:   8/22/12      s/ Timothy S.

This is an action for declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent \ninjunction,  and  nominal  damages  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983  arising  from  the \nunconstitutional  policies  and  practices  of  Defendants.    Due  to  Defendants’  policies, \npractices and custom, as well as certain conduct by one or more Defendants, Plaintiffs \nhave suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm to their rights under the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.  The harm may only be remedied by a ruling from this Court.   \n2.  By maintaining, implementing and enforcing vague policies that (i) restrict \nand prohibit students from engaging in expressive activity on the vast majority of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati campus, (ii) restrict and prohibit spontaneous student speech in \nresponse to recent or still-unfolding events, (iii) vest unfettered discretion in university \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 3 of 27  PAGEID #: 188\nadministrators to restrict student speech, and (iv) threaten students with disciplinary or \ncriminal  charges  for  violation  of  such  policies,  Defendants  have  impeded  and  will \ncontinue to unconstitutionally impede Plaintiffs in their efforts to collect signatures for \npetitions for a state ballot initiative and advocate for its passage. Such expressive activity \nis a core concern of the First Amendment.  \n3.  Additionally, Plaintiffs desire to engage in other activities consistent with \nthe  purpose  and  goals  of  the  organization  and,  in  so  doing,  to  engage  in  activities \nprotected by the First Amendment in and about the University of Cincinnati campus \nwithout being subjected to the threat of enforcement or the actual enforcement of a \npolicy, practice or custom that fails to comply with the requirements of the United States \nConstitution. \n4.  As a result of the policy, practice and custom of the Defendants, as well as \ncertain conduct by one or more Defendants, Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to \nsuffer irreparable harm unless the Defendants are immediately enjoined from restricting \ntheir protected speech in this manner.  \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff University of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty \n(“UC YAL”) is the local chapter of the national group Young Americans for Liberty, and \nis an unincorporated association of students at the University of Cincinnati.

UC  YAL  brings  this  action  on  behalf  of  itself  and  its  members  and \nsupporters. \n6.  One of the activities in which UC YAL is involved includes efforts to \nadvocate and advance the initiative petition process by gathering signatures to place \nfreedom-oriented ballot initiatives before Ohio voters.

All actions by the Defendants described herein were undertaken under \ncolor of state law which caused the deprivation of Plaintiffs' rights protected by the \nUnited States Constitution. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, as this action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 7 of 27  PAGEID #: 192\nUnited States Constitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), in that it is brought to redress \ndeprivations, under color of state law, of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the \nUnited States Constitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), in that it seeks to recover \ndamages and secure equitable relief under an Act of Congress, specifically, 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, which provides a cause of action for the protection of civil and constitutional \nrights; under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), to secure declaratory relief; under 28 U.S.C. § 2202, to \nsecure preliminary and injunctive relief and damages; and under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, to \naward attorneys fees. \n20.  Venue is proper within this judicial district and division pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b) and Local Rule 82.1, as (i) the Defendants are situated within this \njudicial district and division; and (ii) all of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs arose within \nthis judicial district and division. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe University’s Policy \n21.  The University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of over 41,000 students, \nincluding 3,861 on-campus residents.  It has an annual budget of $1.05 billion. \n22.  In Ohio Administrative Code 3361:10-17-01, the board of trustees of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati declared that: \n(A)    The  university  of  Cincinnati,  a  public  institution  dedicated  to \nproviding an environment conductive to teaching, learning, research, and a \ncontinuing search for truth, will not take a position on any matter of \npolitical or public controversy.  \n \n(B)  Any  individual  member  or  group  of  members  of  the  university \ncommunity, like any other citizen or group of citizens, is free to debate \nand take a position on any matter of public controversy. But, since the \ncollective  reputation  of  the  university  cannot  be  abrogated  by  an \nindividual or group as a means of supporting his/her or its position, any \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 8 of 27  PAGEID #: 193\nsuch activity must be taken in a way to make clear that it is not being \ncarried on by or in the name of the university.  \n \n23.  Thus, pursuant to the declaration of the board of trustees of the University \nof Cincinnati, the campus of the University of Cincinnati is dedicated to “providing an \nenvironment  conductive  to  teaching,  learning,  research,  and  a  continuing  search  for \ntruth,” \n24.  However,  despite  making  the  lofty  declaration  that  “[a]ny  individual \nmember or group of members of the university community, like any other citizen or \ngroup  of  citizens,  is  free  to  debate  and  take  a  position  on  any  matter  of  public \ncontroversy,” the University of Cincinnati, through the actions of the Defendants, has \nadopted and regularly enforces a policy, practice and custom that does not provide or \nallow the university campus to be used as an “environment conductive to teaching, \nlearning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \n25.  Despite making the declaration that “[a]ny individual member or group of \nmembers of the university community, like any other citizen or group of citizens, is free to \ndebate and take a position on any matter of public controversy,” the University of Cincinnati, \nthrough the actions of the Defendants, has adopted and regularly enforces a policy, practice \nand custom that severely restricts and burdens the free speech rights of individual students or \ngroups of students, including the free speech rights of the Plaintiffs. \n26.  The University of Cincinnati has a published policy for scheduling use of \ncampus facilities and spaces  for  expressive activities.  The  Use of  Facilities Policy \nManual (the “Policy Manual”) is available at http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common \n/docs/policies/UseFacilitiesManual.pdf.  A true and accurate copy of the Policy Manual is \nattached as Exhibit A. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 9 of 27  PAGEID #: 194\n27.  The Policy Manual states that:  \n \nDemonstrations, Picketing and Rallies \nGroups  planning  a  demonstration  picket  or  rally  should  contact  the \nCampus  Scheduling  Office  or  the  appropriate  scheduling  office  to \nfamiliarize  themselves  with  University  policies  governing  the  activity. \nDemonstrations, picketing or rallies must be scheduled in the appropriate \nscheduling office and may only take place on the northwest corner of \nMcMicken Commons. Anyone requesting to demonstrate, picket or rally \nmust give prior notice of ten (10) working days to the University Police. \nSuch activities are not permitted inside any campus building. Bonfires \nrequire additional clearance from the scheduling office, the Department of \nFacilities  Management,  the  Department  of  Public  Safety,  and  the \nCincinnati Fire Department. \n \n(see Exhibit A, Policy Manual, at 15).  The Uptown West Campus Map shows this area \nof McMicken Commons.  It is indicated by the green shaded area (see Exhibit B, Uptown \nWest Campus Map, modified with color).   \n28.  The terms “demonstration,” “picket,” and “rally” are not defined in the \nPolicy Manual.  No examples are given of what activities any of these terms encompass \nor exclude. \n29.  Thus,  the  failure  of  the  Policy  Manual  to  clearly  define  the  terms \n“demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally” means that a person of ordinary intelligence is not \nafforded the ability to readily identify the applicable standard for inclusion and exclusion \nwithin the requirements of the foregoing policy. \n30.  Furthermore, the failure of the Policy Manual to provide clear standards to \nguide the discretion of the public officials of the University of Cincinnati as to what \nactivities are included within the terms “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally” results in \nenabling  such  public  officials  to  administer  the  foregoing  policy  on  the  basis  of \nimpermissible factors or through arbitrary application. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 10 of 27  PAGEID #: 195\n31.  Because the foregoing policy functions as a licensing scheme with which \nstudents  must  comply  prior  to  engaging  in  the  exercise  of  their  free  speech  rights \n(notwithstanding  that  the  University  of  Cincinnati,  by  the  board  of  trustees’  own \ndeclaration, is dedicated “to providing an environment conductive to teaching, learning, \nresearch, and a continuing search for truth”), the foregoing policy constitutes a prior restraint \non speech, resulting in censorship. \n32.  Because the foregoing policy requires ten working days’ advance notice \nbefore any planned “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally,” a student request for use of the \n“Free Speech Area,” i.e., the northwest corner of McMicken Commons, must be at least \nfourteen calendar days in advance due to intervening weekends not being counted toward \nthe requirement (and even longer if holidays are within the notification period).  \n33.  Because the foregoing policy requires ten working days’ advance notice \nbefore any planned “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally,” the policy unconstitutionally \nprevents spontaneous student expressive activity in response to recent or still-unfolding \nevents, as well as events of a time-sensitive or continuous and ongoing nature. \n34.  On December 8, 2008, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education \n(“FIRE”),  a  non-partisan,  non-profit  501(c)(3)  educational  foundation  dedicated  to \ndefending and sustaining freedom of speech at our nation’s colleges and universities,  \nwrote a letter to the then-president of the University of Cincinnati expressing its concern \nabout the Free Speech Area, the notice requirement, and the threat made in the Policy \nManual that “anyone violating this policy may be charged with trespassing” (attached as \nExhibit C).  FIRE argued that the University’s restrictions were unconstitutionally vague \nand unreasonably restricted student speech in violation of the First Amendment. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 11 of 27  PAGEID #: 196\n35.  On  December  22,  2008,  the  general  counsel  of  the  University  of \nCincinnati responded to FIRE’s comments with a letter defending the Free Speech Area \n(attached as Exhibit D), asserting that the foregoing policy of the University of Cincinnati \nmeets constitutional standards. \n \nThe Fora at Issue \n36.  The  “northwest  corner  of  McMicken  Commons”  referenced  in  the \nforegoing  policy  of  the  University  of  Cincinnati  on  “Demonstrations,  Picketing  and \nRallies” is demarcated in the Policy Manual and referred to as the “Free Speech Area”:  \nFree Speech Area \nThe northwest section (see diagram) of McMicken Commons immediately \neast of McMicken Hall on the West Campus is designated as the main free \nspeech  area.  Individuals  or  groups  wanting  to  use  these  areas  must \nschedule the activity in the Campus Scheduling Office. Anyone violating \nthis policy may be charged with trespassing. No more than one musical or \nspeaking activity is permitted at the same time. \n \n(see Exhibit A, Policy Manual, at 14).  The Free Speech Area is the area immediately east \nof McMicken Hall.  It is indicated by the green shaded area on Exhibit B, the Uptown \nWest Campus Map.  Exhibit E is a photograph of McMicken Commons modified to show \nthe Free Speech Area colored red. \n37.  At its longest points, Plaintiffs estimate that the Free Speech Area is 82 \nfeet east-west and 124 feet north-south. The Free Speech Area is approximately 10,000 \nsquare  feet.    The  West  Campus  of  the  University  is  137  acres,  or  approximately \n8,506,833 square feet.  The Free Speech Area is therefore approximately 0.1% of the total \narea of West Campus. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 12 of 27  PAGEID #: 197\n38.  The  West  Campus  area  has  many  suitable  open  areas  and  sidewalks \nbeyond  the  Free  Speech  Area  where  student  expressive  activity,  including  petition \ngathering  and  political  discussion,  will  not  interfere  with  or  disturb  access  to  UC \nbuildings or sidewalks, impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or in any way substantially \ndisrupt the operations of campus or the University’s educational functions.  \n \nThe Expressive Conduct at Issue \n39.  On February 9, 2012, the Ohio Ballot Board approved language for a \nballot measure proposing an amendment to the Ohio Constitution titled “To guarantee the \nfreedom  of  Ohioans  to  choose  whether  to  participate  in  a  labor  organization  as  a \ncondition of employment” (“the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment”).   \n40.  The approval by the Ohio Ballot Board thus cleared the way for signatures \nto be gathered to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the ballot to be \nvoted on by the voters of Ohio. \n41.  On Monday, February 13, 2012, backers of the Ohio Workplace Freedom \nAmendment finalized the petition and made it available for download and circulation. \n42.  Plaintiffs desire to gather signatures to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom \nAmendment  on  the  ballot,  and  in  the  process,  to  discuss  the  initiative  with  their \nclassmates on campus and to advocate for the passage of the initiative itself.  Doing so \nwould be consistent with the University of Cincinnati’s designation of its campus as an \n“environment conductive to teaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for \ntruth.” \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 13 of 27  PAGEID #: 198\n43.  To qualify for placement on the November 2012 ballot, supporters of the \nOhio Workplace Freedom Amendment need to obtain over 385,000 valid signatures on \npetitions no later than July 9, 2012 (120 days prior to the November 2012 elections).  \nAccordingly, at this time, there are less than four months left to gather these signatures \nfrom registered Ohio voters.   \n44.  Due to invalid signatures that inevitably occur during an initiative petition \neffort  (due  to  various  reasons),  significantly  more  than  385,000  signatures  will  be \nnecessary in order to meet the requisite number of valid signatures.  By way of example, \nthe recently successful Ohio Health Care Freedom Amendment that passed in November \n2011 was also  put  on the ballot  via initiative petitions; supporters of that initiative \nsubmitted 546,074 signatures to the Ohio Secretary of State of which only 426,998 \nsignatures were verified as valid. \n45.  Given this deadline for the petition, on each occasion when Plaintiffs are \nunlawfully and unconstitutionally prevented from collecting signatures and advocating \nfor the passage of the initiative, not only does a violation of their constitutional rights \ntake place, but the likelihood that the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment will be on \nthe November 2012 ballot is reduced. \n46.  The notice requirement of ten working days means that each scheduled \ninstance of gathering to collect signatures on the Free Speech Area faces a potential delay \nof up to fourteen calendar days (or more if there are intervening holidays during the \nnotification period). \n47.  Furthermore,  the  notice  requirement  prohibits  spontaneous  speech  in \nresponse to the actions of the Ballot Board, which substantially burdens the Plaintiffs’ \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 14 of 27  PAGEID #: 199\nFirst Amendment rights and leads to a delay in petition gathering and advocacy for the \nissue. The requirement continues to prohibit spontaneous speech, preventing UC YAL \nfrom gathering signatures when a conversation evokes the interest of a fellow student \nwho may wish to sign a petition. \n48.  Limiting petition gathering and advocacy by preventing students  from \nusing the overwhelming majority of campus grounds for expressive activity substantially \nburdens the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and significantly restricts the number of \nsignatures that may be gathered to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on \nthe November 2012 ballot. \n49.  In reaction to the news of the Ballot Board’s approval to begin collecting \nsignatures, Mr. Morbitzer immediately sent an email on February 9, 2012 to the relevant \nauthorities  at  the  University  of  Cincinnati  (via  the  email  address \n“campusscheduling@uc.edu”) requesting permission to collect signatures and asking for \nclarification  of  the  University’s  policies  classifying  expressive  activity  as  a \n“demonstration, picket, or rally” and therefore limited to the Free Speech Area (attached \nas Exhibit F). \n50.  At 8:05 a.m. on the next day, February 10, 2012, Mr. Morbitzer received \nan unsigned email response from “Conference & Event Services” via the email address \n“campusscheduling@uc.edu.” The response failed to  expressly  clarify  the University \npolicy regarding the definitions of a “demonstration, picket, or rally”; told Mr. Morbitzer \nto “use the online form to request use of McMicken Commons Northwest Corner”; and \nthreatened police action if the Plaintiffs were seen merely “walk[ing] around campus” \nengaging in expressive activity outside of the Free Speech Area (attached as Exhibit G). \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 15 of 27  PAGEID #: 200\n51.  The response from “Conference & Event Services” to Mr. Morbitzer on \nFebruary 10, 2012, was sent by Defendant John Doe who, as noted above, is believed to \nbe one of the named Defendants. \n52.  The response from “Conference & Event Services”  to Mr. Morbitzer on \nFebruary  10,  2012,  implied  that  Plaintiffs’  desired  expressive  activity,  i.e.,  petition \ncirculating, was within the scope of the term “demonstration, picket, or rally.” \n53.  In response, Mr. Morbitzer requested permission via the online form on \nFebruary 10, 2012.  However, the form failed to provide Mr. Morbitzer and UC YAL \nwith the option of requesting permission to engage in their desired expressive activity on \ncampus immediately.   \n54.  Contrary to the University’s Policy Manual, which requires “prior notice \nof  ten  (10)  working  days”  before  engaging  in  expressive  activity  deemed  a \n“demonstration, picket, or rally” in the Free Speech Area, the online form stated that  \n“[o]utdoor spaces must be requested at least 15 days in advance of the event” (attached as \nExhibit H).  No explanation of this discrepancy is given in the Policy Manual.   \n55.  In an email response from Ms. Sisko on Friday, February 10 (a copy of \nwhich is attached as Exhibit I), Mr. Morbitzer’s request was approved only to the extent \nPlaintiffs remained at all times in the Free Speech Area: \nHello Christopher, \n \nPlease see your event confirmation below. You have been assigned the North-\nWest corner of McMicken Commons, however you are not permitted to walk \naround. \n \nAlso note, that your event was approved despite our 5 Day Business Policy. In \nthe future, this will not be allowed. Therefore, make sure you put your event \nrequest in 5 Business Days before your desired date. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 16 of 27  PAGEID #: 201\nReview the Event Guide and Policies link below for important policies and \nprocesses involved with your scheduled space.  \nhttp://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/eventservices/docs/Confirmation%20Notice\n.Policy%20and%20Process.pdf \n \nIf you have any questions please contact Conference & Event Services at 556-\n2442. \n \nThank you, \nConference & Event Services \n \n56.  The approval restricted Plaintiffs’ expressive activity to the Free Speech \nArea (“the North-West corner of McMicken Commons”) and once again noted Plaintiffs \n“are not permitted to walk around.”  This response indicated that Defendants construed \nthe terms “demonstration, picket, or rally” to include expressive activity like the signature \ngathering, advocacy, and discussion in which Plaintiffs sought to engage. \n57.  Based on information and belief, the e-mail from “Conference & Event \nServices” was sent by Defendant John Doe, who, as noted above, is believed to be one of \nthe named Defendants. \n58.  This email response refers to a notification period of five business days, \nwhile the Use of Facilities Policy Manual refers to ten working days, and the online form \nrefers to fifteen days.  No explanation of this discrepancy is given in the Policy Manual.   \n59.  The requirement of five, ten, or fifteen days notice unreasonably prevents \nspontaneous expressive activities in response to recent or still-unfolding events, as well \nas those of a time-sensitive nature. For example, it would have been impossible for \nUniversity  students  to  gather  spontaneously  to  demonstrate  their  shock  and  sadness \nfollowing the tragic events of September 11, 2011, or their support of the United States’ \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 17 of 27  PAGEID #: 202\nsuccessful military operation in killing Osama Bin Laden, without violating University \npolicy.  \n60.  Furthermore, the lack of clarity with regard to which of the three notice \nperiods  is  applicable  breeds  confusion  and  uncertainty  amongst  would-be  student \nspeakers, resulting in an impermissible chilling effect on campus and the arbitrary and \ncapricious enforcement of the policy. \n61.  Plaintiffs  desire  to  engage  in  expressive  activities  beyond  gathering \nsignatures on behalf of the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment.  In addition to seeking \nto gather signatures for this initiative until July of 2012, and possibly July 2013, Plaintiffs \nhave concrete plans to work on future signature-gathering campaigns. \n62.  On Wednesday, February 15, Plaintiffs – consisting of three members of \nUC YAL – engaged in signature gathering, advocacy, and discussion in the Free Speech \nArea as limited by Defendants.  Plaintiffs managed to gather only one signature and were \nonly able to interact with six students as a result of the low pedestrian traffic in and \nadjacent to the Free Speech Area.  Plaintiffs witnessed that the overwhelming majority of \npedestrian traffic on McMicken Commons going to and coming from the surrounding \nbuildings occurred on sidewalks not adjacent to the Free Speech Area, and thus these \nstudents were inaccessible to UC YAL signature gatherers limited to the confines of the \nFree Speech Area. \n63.  As a direct and proximate result of the denial by John Doe of their request \nto  immediately  gather  signatures,  to  advocate  for  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom \nAmendment, and to discuss the initiative’s merits with their fellow students, Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered injury and damages. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 18 of 27  PAGEID #: 203\n64.  The actions of John Doe in denying Plaintiffs’ request to immediately \ngather signatures, to advocate for the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment, and to \ndiscuss the initiative’s merits with their fellow students was the direct and proximate \nresult of the policy, practice and custom of the University of Cincinnati as adopted and \nimplemented by Defendants. \n65.  As a direct and proximate result of John Doe restricting and confining the \nPlaintiffs only within the Free Speech Area in order to engage in the initiative petition \neffort, Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered \ninjury and damages. \n66.  The actions of John Doe in restricting and confining the Plaintiffs only \nwithin the Free Speech Area in order to engage in the initiative petition effort was the \ndirect  and  proximate  result  of  the  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  the  University  of \nCincinnati as adopted and implemented by one or more of the Defendants. \n67.  As a direct and proximate result of the policy, practice and custom of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati as adopted and implemented by one or more of the Defendants, \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered injury and \ndamages. \n \nDefendants’ Inconsistent Application of the Policy at Issue \n68.  As  mentioned  above,  Defendants  seemingly  maintain  three  different \nnotification periods for the same types of expressive activity: five, ten, or fifteen days. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 19 of 27  PAGEID #: 204\n69.  Defendants have also been inconsistent in how they define an expressive \nactivity as a “demonstration, picket or rally” that is therefore limited to the Free Speech \nArea only. \n70.  For example, in October 2011 and the autumn of 2008, Mr. Morbitzer \nwitnessed  individuals  engaged  in  voter  registration  throughout  the  grounds  of  West \nCampus.  They were not limited to the Free Speech Area. \n71.  Similarly,  in  the  spring  of  2009,  Mr.  Morbitzer  witnessed  individuals \ngathering signatures throughout the grounds of West Campus for a proposed amendment \nto the Ohio Constitution to legalize casino gambling.  They were not limited to the Free \nSpeech Area. \n72.  On  information  and  belief,  these  signature  gathering,  advocacy,  and \ndiscussion activities were not classified as a “demonstration, picket, or rally,” while \nPlaintiffs’ identical activity was so classified and was therefore restricted to the Free \nSpeech Area. \n73.  Based  upon  information  and  belief,  officials  within  the  University  of \nCincinnati were aware of such First Amendment activities freely taking place outside the \nFree Speech Area, yet no action was taken to confine such activities within the Free \nSpeech Area. \n74.  In fact, based upon information and belief, officials within the University \nof Cincinnati actively supported or condoned such First Amendment activities freely \ntaking place outside the Free Speech Area. \n75.  To  the  extent  officials  within  the  University  of  Cincinnati  actively \nsupported or condoned such First Amendment activities freely taking place outside the \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 20 of 27  PAGEID #: 205\nFree Speech Area, the restriction of the Plaintiffs to the Free Speech Area for their \ninitiative  petition  effort  constituted  unconstitutional  discrimination  based  upon  the \ncontent or viewpoint of the speaker. \nSTATEMENT OF LAW \n76.  The University of Cincinnati is a state actor.  See Thomson v. Harmony, 65 \nF.3d  1314,  1319  (6th  Cir.  1995)  (“The University  of  Cincinnati is \na state instrumentality”); Hall v. Medical College of Ohio, 742 F.2d 299, 303–04 (6th Cir. \n1984) (discussing how state universities in Ohio, including University of Cincinnati, are \nconsidered “arms of the state”). \n77.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, each and all of \nthe acts alleged herein were attributed to one or more of the Defendants acting under the \ncolor, authority, and pretense of state law, statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs, \nusages, and policies of the University of Cincinnati. \n78.  Soliciting and gathering signatures on a petition is core political speech \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Meyer v. Grant, \n486 U.S. 414, 422 n.5, 425 (1988). \n79.  The  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  extend  to  campuses  of  state \nuniversities.  Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972). \n80.  Due process requires that a state enactment be held void for vagueness if \nthe prohibitive terms are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary intelligence \ncan readily identify the applicable standard for inclusion and exclusion.  Grayned v. City \nof Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 21 of 27  PAGEID #: 206\n81.  The absence of clear standards guiding the discretion of the public official \nvested with the authority to enforce the enactment invites abuse by enabling the official \nto administer the policy on the basis of impermissible factors.  Leonardson v. City of East \nLansing, 896 F.2d 190, 198 (6th Cir. 1990). \n82.  The vagueness doctrine “requires that the limits the [government] claims \nare implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or \nadministrative construction, or well-established practice.”  City of Lakewood v. Plain \nDealer Publ’g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 770 (1988). \n83.  A traditional public forum like a park or public sidewalk is subject to \nreasonable “time, place and manner” restrictions that are narrowly tailored to serve a \nsignificant  government  interest  and  leave  open  ample  alternative  channels  of \ncommunication.  Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 \n(1983). \n84.  A designated public forum is a forum the government intentionally opens \nto expressive activity to the public at large.  Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, \n534 (6th Cir. 2010).  The standards under the First  Amendment are the same as a \ntraditional public forum.  Pleasant Grove v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 469–70 (2009). \n85.  “The campus of a public university, at least for its students, possesses \nmany of the characteristics of a public forum.”  Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 267 n.5 \n(1981). \n86.  As noted above, the board of trustees of the University of Cincinnati have \ndeclared that the university is “dedicated to providing an environment conductive to \nteaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 22 of 27  PAGEID #: 207\n87.  Thus, the campus of the University of Cincinnati (or, at least, areas other \nthan the Free Speech Area) constitute dedicated public fora in which students, including \nPlaintiffs, are entitled to engage in speech protected under the First Amendment.  And \nsome areas of the campus of the University of Cincinnati (including the public sidewalks \nadjacent to various streets) constitute traditional public fora. \nCOUNT I \n \nVIOLATION OF RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH UNDER \nTHE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n  \n88.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein.  \n89.  The policies and actions of Defendants vest unfettered discretion in the \nDefendants to restrict constitutionally protected expression. \n90.  The policies and actions of Defendants are prior restraints and restrictions \non speech in campus areas that are commonly considered traditional or designated public \nfora. \n91.  The  Defendants’  purported  “time,  place  and  manner”  restrictions  are \nunreasonable in light of the purpose of the forum, overly broad,  not content-neutral, are \nnot narrowly tailored to serve significant government interests, and do not leave open \nample alternative channels of communication. \n92.  As  a  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  actions,  Plaintiffs  have  been \nirreparably injured, and will continue in the future to be irreparably injured, in that they \nhave been and will be deprived of their right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the Constitution.  \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 23 of 27  PAGEID #: 208\n93.  As  a  direct  result  of  the  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  rights  and  the  continued  maintenance  of  the  Use  of  Facilities  Policy, \nPlaintiffs continue to be prohibited from engaging their fellow students in discussion, \nadvocating on behalf of their political beliefs, and collecting sufficient signatures to \nsuccessfully place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the November 2012 \nballot. \n94.  As a legal consequence of the Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as alleged above, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief \nand, from Ms. Sisko and John Doe, to recover nominal damages. \nCOUNT II \n \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS \nUNDER THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n  \n95.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n96.  The policies and conduct of Defendants are unconstitutionally vague on \ntheir face.  They fail to adequately advise, notify, or inform students threatened with \ndisciplinary action and criminal prosecution for violation, and thus have a chilling effect \non speech. \n97.  The Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of limiting the expressive \nactivities on campus it defines as constituting a “demonstration, picket, or rally” to the \nFree Speech Area is unconstitutional and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 24 of 27  PAGEID #: 209\n98.  The Defendants’ policy, practice and custom of allowing its agents or \nother  authorized  individuals  unbridled  discretion  in  determining  which  expressive \nactivities constitute a “demonstration, picket, or rally” – and thus are subject to the \nnotification requirement of ten working days and limited to the Free Speech Area – \nviolates Plaintiffs’ rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \n99.  As  a  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  actions,  Plaintiffs  have  been \nirreparably injured, and will continue in the future to be irreparably injured, in that they \nhave been and will be deprived of their right to free speech and due process of law under \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  \n100.  As  a  direct  result  of  the  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights, Plaintiffs are at continued risk of being unable to engage their fellow \nstudents in discussion, advocate on behalf of their political beliefs, and collect sufficient \nsignatures  to  successfully  place  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom  Amendment  on  the \nNovember 2012 ballot. \n101.  As a legal consequence of the Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as alleged above, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief \nand, from Brittany Sisko and John Doe, to recover nominal damages. \nCOUNT III \n  \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTION \n(28 U.S.C. § 2201, et seq.) \n \n102.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 15 Filed: 03/21/12 Page: 25 of 27  PAGEID #: 210\n103.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants concerning Plaintiffs’ rights under the United States Constitution.  A judicial \ndeclaration is necessary and appropriate at this time as to Counts I through II above.   \n104.  Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights against Defendants \nas they pertain to Plaintiffs’ right to speak, assemble, and gather signatures on petitions \non the outdoor areas campus of the University of Cincinnati without being subjected to a \nprior restraint or “time, place, and manner” regulations which are unreasonable, not \ncontent neutral, not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest, and do \nnot leave open ample alternative channels of communication. \n105.  In order to prevent further violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights by \nDefendants, it is appropriate and proper that a declaratory judgment be issued, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and FED.

As with all state, federal and local entities, “public” \ndoes not mean that all areas are open to the general public.   The are some areas, such as sport \nand performing arts venues, shops and restaurants, where access by the general public is \npermitted, and in many cases, encouraged.  On the other hand, classrooms, laboratories, \nacademic offices, student lounges and other educational and research venues are not open to the \ngeneral public but are for the most part limited to the use of faculty, students, staff and invited \nguests who have business related to the mission of the University (the “University Community”).  \n \nWhen a building contains areas that are designated as open to the general public, access is \nlimited to those areas and only during specified hours.  Unless otherwise posted, most public \naccess areas are accessible by the general public during normal business hours (Monday – Friday \nfrom 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM).  During other days and/or hours, all areas in the building are \nrestricted to the University Community. \n \nAs noted above, there are some exceptions to this restriction; such as when a public event is \nbeing held in a university building; e.g. CCM performances, athletic events, meetings open to the \npublic, etc., or when a building contains areas intended for public/guest/alumni use; e.g. \nbookstores, libraries, restaurants, recreation areas, etc.   \n \nThere are some facilities that are restricted, even during normal business hours, and not all areas \nof the University are open to all members of the University Community. These areas are posted \nand/or locked. (Access to residence halls is restricted at all hours to residents, registered guests \nand authorized staff.)  \n \n \nUse of Storage Facilities on Campus \nThe University of Cincinnati does not permit use of any storage areas or facilities (such as \nlockers, cabinets, etc.) by anyone without express permission.  Items found stored in violation of \nthis section of the Use of Facilities Policy Manual will be confiscated and disposed of in \naccordance with the law concerning found property and/or contraband, as indicated by the type \nof property. \n \n \n  3\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  44  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  23126\n \nGENERAL POLICIES PERTAINING TO THE USE OF UNIVERSITY FACILITIES \nThe policies stated herein were developed by the Use of Facilities Policy Committee.  They were \napproved by the Academic and Administrative Councils and the President of the University of \nCincinnati and are administered and interpreted by the appropriate scheduling office.  Appeals \nrelated to the application of these policies are to be referred to the Use of Facilities Policy \nCommittee for review.  These policies are not applicable to the Housing and Food Services \nOffice or Hospital patient care areas which have their own separate policies. \nThe facilities of the University are the property of the State of Ohio, and are subject to all \napplicable state laws, rules and regulations.  \nNon-University individuals or groups can schedule use of University facilities within certain \nlimitations. \nThe following priority is used for scheduling facilities: \n1.  Academic classes \n2.  Academic related activities \n3.  Activities sponsored or co-sponsored by the University of a University group. \n4.  Activities sponsored by a non-University group. \n \nA non-University group may reserve facilities only if comparable facilities are not available \ncommercially elsewhere in the local community.  Requests by non-University groups for use of \nUniversity facilities for activities which are in competition with the University’s educational or \ncultural offerings (classes, seminars, etc.), are not approved.  Determination of whether \ncompetition exists is decided by the appropriate scheduling office in consultation with academic \nand administrative units. \nThe University of Cincinnati reserves the right to change facility assignments or to cancel any \npreviously scheduled facility if such change or cancellation is made to meet University needs.  \nThe University is not responsible for any costs or damages suffered by a sponsoring group as a \nresult of such change or cancellation. \nResponsibilities of All Groups/Individuals Using University Facilities \nThe sponsor must conduct an event in a manner that complies with all policies regarding the use \nof University facilities.  The sponsor assumes total responsibility including, but not limited to \nfinancial and legal obligations for an event using University facilities.  Specific smoking and use \nof alcohol regulations apply to University facilities and are detailed in Appendices B and C.  \nGroups and individuals who sponsor an event are responsible for any loss or damage incurred by \nthe University resulting from their occupancy of University facilities. \n \nRental Charges and Expenses \nA standard rental charge is made for the use of University facilities by a non-University group.  \nNo rental charge is made for the use of facilities for an event sponsored by the University or a \nUniversity group held during hours when campus buildings are regularly open unless admission \nis charged or donations are requested.  No rental charges are made for the use of facilities for \nevents if the University is compensated through other direct methods, i.e., tuition, fees and/or \n  4\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  55  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  23137\ngrants.  Rental charges may be obtained from the appropriate scheduling office.  Student \norganizations sponsoring events involving admission charges or donations must obtain approval \nof the Student Activities and Leadership Development’s Financial Advisor.  All rental charges \nare payable two weeks in advance of the event.  Charges are assessed to all groups for direct \nexpenses incurred as a result of occupancy beyond regular hours, special equipment, set-ups, \nservices, and personnel required to service an event.  All charges are based on the University \nSchedule of Charges for Use of Facilities on file in the appropriate scheduling offices.  Requests \nfor exceptions to established charges or advance payment are referred to the Use of Facilities \nPolicy Committee. \nPayment of all charges for the use of University facilities and services is the responsibility of the \ngroup and/or the agent representing the group.  If the group does not meet its financial \nobligations to the University, the individual who requested use of facility is responsible for the \npayment.  University groups which co-sponsor an event with a non-University group or \norganization are responsible for any financial and legal obligations incurred if not settled by the \nnon-University group.  Non-University groups must pay all outstanding charges within thirty \n(30) days following issuance by the University of a Statement of charges incurred unless \notherwise stipulated in a signed contract. \nSafety and Security \nDue to fire safety and building code regulations, stairways and corridors within buildings may \nnot be used as gathering places or for holding events.  Security requirements for all events using \nUniversity facilities are determined by the University Department of Public Safety.  Compliance \nwith all safety and security laws is the responsibility of the sponsoring group or individual, but \nthe University Police have the ultimate authority to insure compliance with all rules, regulations \nand laws.  Persons present on University property are subject to the authority of the University \nPolice.  Non-University groups must obtain and maintain public liability insurance covering \nbodily injury and property damage in an amount to be determined by the appropriate scheduling \noffice.  A security deposit may be required. \nThe authority to determine the number of police/security personnel assigned to an event, their \npost/are of assignment, and their duties rests with the Department of Public Safety. \nThe University Police Officer assigned to an event shall insure compliance with safety rules, \nregulations, and laws.  The use of firearms (including blanks), explosives, and/or pyrotechnics is \nprohibited without the express written permission of the Department of Public Safety. \n \nPolitical Programs and Activities \nUniversity groups may sponsor a political candidate for speaking engagements only.  University \nfacilities may not be used for political fundraising activities where solicitations of funds, \ndonations or similar activities take place.  No solicitation of funds may take place for the benefit \nof the sponsoring political organization and/or the political candidate.  University facilities are \nnot available to non-University groups for partisan political programs, receptions, fundraisers or \nsimilar activities. \n  5\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  66  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  23148\n \nFundraising \nServices of facilities are not available for fundraising purposes if the funds are designed solely to \nenrich an individual or commercial sponsor.  This does not preclude fundraising activities in \nsupport of University groups or organizations. \nDistribution of Printed Materials, Publicity, Promotional Methods, Posted Materials \nIndividuals wanting to distribute printed materials on the West Campus grounds must first \nschedule the activity/distribution points in the Campus Scheduling Office.  Distribution to the \nUniversity community of printed materials, including fliers, handbills, and announcements, is \nlimited to the northwest section of Mc Micken Commons, the sidewalk in front of Baldwin and \nthe angled sidewalk on Sigma Sigma Commons (see diagram).  In the interests of patient care, no \ndistribution of printed materials is allowed on East Campus grounds. \nDistribution must be done in an orderly manner and must not interrupt traffic on campus or \notherwise interfere with the normal use of the area.  Material distributed must have the name of \nthe sponsoring person or group clearly indicated on the material.

Requests for reservations during times when a facility is not scheduled for \nUniversity sponsored events are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis. \nWest Campus \nThe Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling, maintains the central file of \nsome general purpose classrooms and seminar rooms and has scheduling authority in the rooms \nMonday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  This Division schedules rooms for the \nMcMicken College of Arts and Sciences, the University College, the College of Education, the \nCollege of Engineering and the School of Social Work., This Division also schedules some space \nin the College of Business Administration, and the College of Design, Art, Architecture, and \nPlanning.  The College Conservatory of Music and the College of Law facilities are scheduled in \ntheir respective college offices.  The College of Business Administration schedules academic \nspace in Lindner Hall until class orders are submitted, then the Division of Registration and \nScheduling assumes scheduling responsibility.  The College of Design, Art, Architecture and \nPlanning schedules use of its academic space with some assistance from the Division of \nRegistration and Scheduling.  The Campus Scheduling Office schedules the use of academic \nspace for conferences, meeting and events when class is not in session and on weekends.   The \nDivision of Registration and Scheduling coordinates the scheduling of academic space for other \ncourses convening after 6:30 p.m. \nEast Campus \nCollege of Medicine facilities in the Health Professions Building and the Medical Sciences \nBuilding may be used only when scheduled and confirmed in advance.  An Application to \nSchedule Facilities must be completed for each event and submitted to the Medical Art and \nDesign Services (MADS) for approval.  Consideration for the use of facilities is given to \ncomplete, signed, written applications only.  No oral requests will be honored.  Final approval \nand rental charges for the use of facilities are based on the type and scope of the event, the \nfinancial arrangements, and the department or organization responsible for the event.  Facilities \nare reserved “as is.”  No arrangement of equipment, personnel, or services is included or implied \nwith the confirmation of any College of Medicine facility.  Facilities are not officially reserved \nuntil a signed confirmation copy of the application is received by the applicant from MADS. \nCollege of Medicine academic classes and exams have the highest priority and supercede all \nother use of facilities.  Monday-Friday 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., facilities are reserved exclusively \nfor academic classes and exams, College of Medicine, Medical Center and University sponsored \nevents only.  Non-University events are not scheduled in the facilities during the academic day.  \nAfter 6:00 p.m.  Monday-Friday, and on weekends, consideration is given to non-University \nsponsored events for the use of Kresge Auditorium or Classroom E-351 only.  No other College \nof Medicine facility is available for non-University events at any time. \nThe Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing each schedule the use of their own facilities at the \nrespective college office.  Room reservations for the College of Pharmacy required courses,  \n  9\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  1100  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  23282\n \nelective courses, seminars, and other programs are scheduled in preference to all other room \nreservation requests.  Room reservations for the College of Nursing and Health must be made as \nfar in advance as possible.  Room assignments are made in a manner that will accommodate the \nnumber of students and best utilize the Procter Hall facilities.  College of Nursing Health \nfacilities may be reserved for conferences, meetings, or other special purposes on a one-time \nonly basis.  These reservations must be made far enough in advance to avoid conflict in \nscheduling.  Requests for special arrangements of chairs, tables, etc., must be made two weeks in \nadvance. \nBranch Campuses \nClassrooms, seminar rooms, and laboratories are scheduled through the individual college \noffices.  At Raymond Walters College, OMI College of Applied Science, and Clermont College, \nclassrooms used for academic purposes are requested on a class order form or by memo through \nthe college office.  Classrooms for non-academic purposes are scheduled via memo or forms \nthrough the Business Office. \nProcedures: \nScheduling of teaching laboratories and special purpose rooms is accomplished through the \nindividual departments or colleges responsible for those facilities.  However, the usage of these \nrooms is reported to the Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling when \nthe class orders are submitted.  All requests for specific classrooms, seminar rooms and \nauditoria, must be directed to the Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and \nScheduling, on a class order form each quarter.  A class order may be placed at any point in the \nquarter and students have access to the course through the registration process on the same day \nthe class order is placed.  To have the class published in “Learning Opportunities,” the schedule \nof classes, a class order must be placed by a specific deadline date three (3) to six (6) months in \nadvance of the start of the quarter.  If no room is available, the class order will not be entered and \nthe college/department will be notified that the class order is being held until a room opens at the \nrequested time or the department will be offered alternate, open time slots. \nEach college and/or department is given preference in their own building or in adjacent buildings \nas space permits.  Classes are scheduled into classrooms based on estimated enrollment when the \nmix of rooms available allows a match of the room with the estimated enrollment.  Requests for \nthe use of specific classrooms on a preferred basis may be made, but there is no guarantee that \nthe specific room requested will be scheduled.  Although the scheduling office prefers to keep all \nclasses in the same room each quarter, the changing mix of course/selections each quarter \nincluding on quarter courses, and trailer courses, makes it impossible to keep all continuing \ncourses in the rooms that they occupied in the Autumn Quarter. \nExtra (all-quarter) one day meeting times called “extra rooms” for regularly scheduled academic \ncourses are scheduled only after all other academic scheduling has occurred.  One day meetings \nare currently not scheduled until the week before the quarter begins. \nOn the West Campus, large auditoria scheduling occurs once annually in January for the next \nacademic year.  Large auditoria request forms are delivered to all colleges and Arts and Sciences \ndepartments in December each year, and are due the first week of January.  Scheduling is  \n  10\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  1111  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  23293\n \naccomplished before February 1 so that college/departments know their large auditoria schedule \nin order to plan their other course requests before Autumn class orders are due.  After the \nschedule for large auditoria is published, a course/section may not change the day or time.  \nRemaining space may be requested for use by any college/department and it is granted whenever \npossible.  The Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling has final authority \nto move course/sections if the need arises, especially if a larger course/section needs one of these \nlarge auditoria.  On the East Campus, large auditoria scheduling arrangements are made though \nthe college offices. \nOnce the scheduling process of course/sections is completed for a quarter (about 45 days before \nclasses begin), classroom assignments are sent to each college.  Once room assignments are \npublished and circulated, a college/department may request a room change.  Since room \nassignments are published on schedule/bills, room changes should not be made unless absolutely \nnecessary.  The students receive no notice that a room change has occurred prior to going to the \nfirst class meeting where a room change sign is posted directing them to the new room.  Room \nchange requests are accomplished through the department or college to keep them updated as to \nthe new location of the course.  Room change requests are honored if a room is available that \nwill accommodate the course/section enrollment.

These posting boards are located across campus in high traffic areas for high \nvisibility.     \nTemporary directional signs for special campus events and activities shall be located according \nto a pre-approved plan prepared and submitted by sponsoring college, department or university \norganization and posted on mobile boards or portable day-event boards as outlined in the \nuniversity’s Signage Policy and Standard. \n \nAllowable Sizes:  Temporary signs for posting on approved signboards and kiosks shall be a \nmaximum size of 20” x 30”.  Temporary directional signs shall be a maximum size of 30” x 40”. \nAllowable Materials:  Temporary signs shall be constructed of weather-resistant material.  \nWaterproof paints or inks must be used.  Wire frame supports shall not be allowed. \nAllowable Posting Time:  Temporary signs located on signboards and kiosks may be posted one \nweek prior to the event or program advertised in the sign and must be removed within five \ncalendar days following the event.   \nTemporary directional signs shall be put in place the first day of the relative event or program \nand removed no later than the day following the event or program. \nProcedure for Temporary Sign Approval:  No prior approval for freestanding or wall mounted \nposting board signs complying with the guidelines noted above will be required.  Temporary \ndirectional signs using mobile boards or portable day-event boards must be requested at lease \ntwo weeks in advance of the specific event along with a site location plan for the requested signs.  \nRequests should be submitted to the Campus Scheduling Office. \n \n \nTENT AND CANOPY USE ON CAMPUS \nGeneral: \nGroups desiring to erect a tent or canopy on campus for an event need to be aware that various \nfire and building code requirements apply to these structures.  In general, permits from the state \n  61\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  6622  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29704\nare NOT required for tents which are 200 square feet (10’ x 20’) or smaller.  A tent is a fabric \nstructure with more than two side walls. \nState permits are NOT required for canopies which are 400 square feet (20’ x 20’).  A canopy is \na fabric structure with up to two sides.  In the case of a canopy with no side walls, it may have a \nmaximum size of 700 square feet (20’ x 35’) without a permit being required.  If multiple \ncanopies are used, they must be at least 12 feet apart. \nIn all cases, a clearance of at least 12 feet must be maintained from buildings.  Also groups \nshould keep in mind that many grass areas on campus have buried utilities and sprinkler lines.  \nPlacement of poles or stakes into the ground must avoid these locations. \nWhile UC will endeavor to obtain the necessary permits, it is the ultimate responsibility of the \nevent organizer to have the permits prior to the day of the event.  Should the permits not be \nobtained, the event may not occur.   \n \nRequest to erect a tent or canopy: \nWhenever tens and canopies are going to be erected, notice must be given to Public Safety at \nleast ten business days in advance.  The Fire Prevention Unit will review the plan and assist the \nsponsoring group with any required state permits.  Whenever possible we will assist you in \ndesigning your event to avoid or minimize the required state permits and costs.  Send completed \ntent/canopy request forms to the Fire Prevention Unit at Mail Location 180.  If you have \nquestions or need assistance please call us at 556-4934. \n \nSignage and Safety Equipment: \nEach tent or canopy erected must have a fire extinguisher mounted in a visible location.  The \nextinguisher must be a 5 or 10 pound dry chemical, type ABC.  The company renting the tent \nshould be able to provide this extinguisher and a stand to mount it on. \nEach tent or canopy erected must have one or more no smoking signs posted so that they are \nvisible throughout the structure.  The no smoking signs must be at least 8” x 10” in size, with at \nleast 2” lettering. \n \nCooking Equipment and Open Flame: \nThe use of cooking equipment, grills, and any open flame is not permitted inside a tent or \ncanopy.  Please be aware that if you are planning on using this type of equipment outside the tent \nor canopy, a separate permit and inspection process is involved, although this is also coordinated \nthrough the Fire Prevention unit. \n \nSound and Lighting Equipment: \nThe use of public address systems inside a tent or canopy is permitted as long as they electrical \nsupply is protected by a Ground Fault Interrupter.  The use of any lighting equipment requires a \npermit and inspection from the state Industrial Compliance office (see Permit Fees below).  \nElectrical service must be requested from Facilities Management. \n \nPermit Fees: \nWhen the use of tents or canopies requires state permits, the State Fire Marshall and the State \nIndustrial Compliance office both charge user fees.  UC is not exempt from these fees, and the \ngroup sponsoring the event must pay the fees.  The State Fire Marshall’s office charges a fee of \n  62\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--11  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  6633  ooff  6633    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29715\n$75.00 per event for inspecting tents, regardless of the number involved.  If your event uses one \ntent or twenty, the fee is always $75.00. \nThe industrial Compliance fee schedule is considerably more complicated.  The base fee is \n$228.25 for EACH tent or canopy.  If the tent/canopy is wired for electricity there is an \nadditional fee of $175.00 and if the tent/canopy has a mechanical system to provide ventilation \n(fans/Heat/air conditioning) there is another fee of $175.00.  So if you intend to use a single tent \nwith lights and fans, the Industrial Compliance fee for that tent is $578.25. \n \nInspections: \nIn all cases where a tent or canopy is being used on campus, an inspection is required.  Where a \npermit is required from the State Fire Marshall or from Industrial Compliance, those offices will \ninspect the installation.  Where no state permit is required then the University of Cincinnati’s \nFire Prevention unit will inspect the installation.  If this inspection can be completed during \nnormal business hours, there is no charge for the inspection.  If it must be done after hours, then \nthe sponsoring organization must pay the overtime costs. \n \n \n  63\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--22  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  11    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29726\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--33  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29737\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--33  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  22  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29748\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--33  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  33  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29759\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--33  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  44  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29860\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--44  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  22    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29871\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--44  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  22  ooff  22    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29882\n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:122-c-cvv-0-000115555-T-MSRB BD Doco c# :# 1: 51--55  FFiilleedd::  0032//2212//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  11    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  29893\n \n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--66  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  22    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120804\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--66  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  22  ooff  22    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120815\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--77  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  33    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120826\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--77  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  22  ooff  33    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120837\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--77  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  33  ooff  33    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120848\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--88  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  11    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120859\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--99  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  11  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120960\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--99  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  22  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120971\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--99  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  33  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120982\n\nCCaassee::  11::1122--ccvv--0000115555--TMSRBB D Doocc # #: :1 15--99  FFiilleedd::  0023//2221//1122  PPaaggee::  44  ooff  44    PPAAGGEEIIDD  ##::  120993\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty et al v.

This is an action for declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunction, \nand nominal damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983 arising from the unconstitutional policies and \npractices of Defendants.  Due to Defendants‟ policies, practices and custom, as well as certain \nconduct  by  one  or  more  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer \nirreparable harm to their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The harm may only be remedied \nby a ruling from this Court.   \n2.  By maintaining, implementing and enforcing vague policies that (i) restrict and \nprohibit  students  from  engaging  in  certain  expressive  activity  on  the  vast  majority  of  the \nUniversity of Cincinnati campus, (ii) restrict and prohibit spontaneous student speech in response \nto recent or still-unfolding events, (iii) vest unfettered discretion in university administrators to \nrestrict  student  speech,  and  (iv)  threaten  students  with  disciplinary  or  criminal  charges  for \nviolation of such policies, Defendants have impeded and will continue to unconstitutionally \nimpede Plaintiffs in their efforts to collect signatures for petitions for a state ballot initiative and \nadvocate for its passage. Such expressive activity is a core concern of the First Amendment.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 3 of 146  PAGEID #: 1424\n3.  Additionally, Plaintiffs desire to engage in other activities consistent with the \npurpose and goals of the organization and, in so doing, to engage in activities protected by the \nFirst Amendment in and about the University of Cincinnati campus without being subjected to \nthe threat of enforcement or the actual enforcement of a policy, practice or custom that fails to \ncomply with the requirements of the United States Constitution. \n4.  As a result of the policy, practice and custom of the Defendants, as well as certain \nconduct  by  one  or  more  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer \nirreparable harm unless the Defendants are immediately enjoined from restricting their protected \nspeech in this manner.  \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff University of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty (“UC \nYAL”) is the local chapter of the national group Young Americans for Liberty, and is an \nunincorporated association of students at the University of Cincinnati.  UC YAL is an officially \nrecognized student organization at the University of Cincinnati.  It consists solely of students at \nthe University of Cincinnati and a faculty advisor.  UC YAL seeks to recruit, train, educate, and \nmobilize students on the ideals of liberty and the United States Constitution.  UC YAL brings \nthis action on behalf of itself and its members and supporters. \n6.  One of the activities in which UC YAL is involved includes efforts to advocate \nand advance the initiative petition process by gathering signatures to place freedom-oriented \nballot initiatives before Ohio voters.  At the present time and in support of this effort, UC YAL \nseeks  to  gather  signatures  on  the  University  campus  for  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom \nAmendment, for which the deadline to submit signatures is July 9, 2012, if it is to appear on the \nNovember  2012  ballot,  or  approximately  the  same  date  in  2013  if  it  is  to  appear  on  the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 4 of 146  PAGEID #: 1425\nNovember 2013 ballot.  UC YAL anticipates working on similar ballot initiatives in the future, \nincluding those related to tax limitations and school choice. \n7.  Plaintiff Christopher Morbitzer is a student at the University of Cincinnati and \nPresident of UC YAL.   \n8.  The University of Cincinnati (“UC” or the “University”) is a public university \nlocated in Cincinnati, Ohio.  It is part of the university system of Ohio and is a “state university” \norganized pursuant to Section 3361.01 et seq. of the Ohio Revised Code.  \n9.  Defendant Gregory H. Williams is, and has been at all times relevant to the facts \nat issue in this case, the President of the University of Cincinnati.  As President of the University \nof Cincinnati, Mr. Williams is the university‟s chief administrative and executive officer. \n10.  Pursuant  to  Ohio  Administrative  Code  3361:10-5-01(J),  as  President  of  the \nUniversity  of  Cincinnati,  Mr.  Williams  “shall  have  the  authority  to  adopt  necessary  and \nreasonable policies and procedures regarding the use of the facilities of the university, which \namplify the university rules, and Ohio and federal law. [He] shall also have the authority to \namend or rescind such policies and procedures.” \n11.  Pursuant  to  Ohio  Administrative  Code  3361:10-5-01(O),  as  President  of  the \nUniversity of Cincinnati, Mr. Williams “shall have the authority to:  (1) Adopt amendments to \nany university rule which: (a) Would clarify or correct the language of the rule but would not \nconstitute  a  substantive  change;  or    (b)  Would  conform  the  rule  to  applicable  laws  or \nregulations.” \n12.  Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 3361:10-1-09(B)(2)(a), as President of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati, Mr. Williams “may amend any rule of the university . . . which . . . \nwould conform the rule to applicable laws or regulations.” \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 5 of 146  PAGEID #: 1426\n13.  Defendant Corinn Shemak is, and has been at all times relevant to the facts at \nissue in this case, the Program Director of Conference & Event Services at the University of \nCincinnati.  Based upon information and belief, Defendant Corinn Shemak, as part of her official \nduties  and  responsibilities  with  the University of Cincinnati,  implements  or  enforces  the \nunconstitutional restrictions accomplished through the University‟s policies and practices (as \ndescribed herein). \n14.  Defendant Cathy Krumpelbeck is, and has been at all times relevant to the facts at \nissue in this case, the Public Safety Special Events Coordinator at the University of Cincinnati.  \nBased upon information and belief, Defendant Cathy Krumpelbeck, as part of her official duties \nand  responsibilities  with  the University of Cincinnati,  implements  or  enforces  the \nunconstitutional restrictions accomplished through the University‟s policies and practices (as \ndescribed herein). \n15.  Defendant Michael Cureton is, and has been at all times relevant to the facts at \nissue  in  this  case,  the  Director  of  Public  Safety  and  Chief  of  Police  at  the  University  of \nCincinnati Department of Public Safety.  Based upon information and belief, Defendant Michael \nCureton,  as  part  of  his  official  duties  and  responsibilities  with  the University of Cincinnati, \nimplements or enforces the unconstitutional restrictions accomplished through the University‟s \npolicies and practices (as described herein). \n16.  Defendant Brittany Sisko is an individual who undertook specific action so as to \ndeprive and/or violate the constitutional rights of the Plaintiffs and did so in her individual \ncapacity,  as  part  of  her  official  duties  and  responsibilities  as  an  employee  or  agent  of \nthe University of Cincinnati, and in her official capacity of adopting and implementing a policy, \npractice or custom of the University of Cincinnati. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 6 of 146  PAGEID #: 1427\n17.  All actions by the Defendants described herein were undertaken under color of \nstate  law  which  caused  the  deprivation  of  Plaintiffs‟  rights  protected  by  the  United  States \nConstitution. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331, as this action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), in that it is brought to redress deprivations, under \ncolor  of  state  law,  of  rights,  privileges,  and  immunities  secured  by  the  United  States \nConstitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), in that it seeks to recover damages and secure \nequitable relief under an Act of Congress, specifically, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides a cause \nof action for the protection of civil and constitutional rights; under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), to secure \ndeclaratory relief; under 28 U.S.C. § 2202, to  secure preliminary and injunctive relief and \ndamages; and under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, to award attorneys fees. \n19.  Venue is proper within this judicial district and division pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(b) and Local Rule 82.1, as (i) the Defendants are situated within this judicial district and \ndivision; and (ii) all of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs arose within this judicial district and \ndivision. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n20.  The University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of over 41,000 students, including \n3,861 on-campus residents.  It has an annual budget of $1.05 billion, and the majority of these \nfunds are the result of public funding. \n21.  University of Cincinnati speech policies are enforced by the City of Cincinnati \nPolice Department, not by University staff.  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 7 of 146  PAGEID #: 1428\n22.  In  Ohio  Administrative  Code  3361:10-17-01,  the  board  of  trustees  of  the \nUniversity of Cincinnati declared as follows: \n(A)  The university of Cincinnati, a public institution dedicated to providing an \nenvironment conductive to teaching, learning, research, and a continuing search \nfor truth, will not take a position on any matter of political or public controversy.  \n \n(B) Any individual member or group of members of the university community, \nlike any other citizen or group of citizens, is free to debate and take a position on \nany  matter  of  public  controversy.  But,  since  the  collective  reputation  of  the \nuniversity cannot be abrogated by an individual or group as a means of supporting \nhis/her or its position, any such activity must be taken in a way to make clear that \nit is not being carried on by or in the name of the university.  \n \n23.  Thus, pursuant to the declaration of the board of trustees of the University of \nCincinnati, the campus of the University of Cincinnati is dedicated to “providing an environment \nconductive to teaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \n24.  However, despite making the lofty declaration that “[a]ny individual member or \ngroup of members of the university community, like any other citizen or group of citizens, is free \nto debate and take a position on any matter of public controversy,” the University of Cincinnati, \nthrough the actions of the Defendants, has adopted and regularly enforces a policy, practice and \ncustom that does not provide or allow the university campus to be used as an “environment \nconductive to teaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \nThe University of Cincinnati’s Speech Policies \n25.  The University of Cincinnati, through the actions of the Defendants, has adopted \nand regularly enforces policies, practices and customs that severely restrict and burdens the free \nspeech rights of individual students or groups of students, including the free speech rights of the \nPlaintiffs. \n26.  Through its April 27, 2012 Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants claim to \nhave altered UC speech policies.   \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 8 of 146  PAGEID #: 1429\n27.  This action requests declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys fees \nas to the discreet past deprivation of Plaintiffs‟ capacity to speak, UC‟s “prior” speech polices, to \nthe extent that they have actually been altered, and UC‟s “current” speech policies, to the extent \nthat they have been modified as Defendants suggest in their April 27, 2012 filings. \n The University of Cincinnati’s “Prior”-Current Speech Policies  \n28.  The University of Cincinnati has a published policy for scheduling use of campus \nfacilities and spaces for expressive activities.  The Use of Facilities Policy Manual (the “Policy \nManual”)  is  available  at  http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common \n/docs/policies/UseFacilitiesManual.pdf.    A  true  and  accurate  copy  of  the  Policy  Manual  is \nattached as Exhibit A.  The Policy Manual states:  \nDemonstrations, Picketing and Rallies \nGroups  planning  a  demonstration  picket  or  rally  should  contact  the  Campus \nScheduling Office or the appropriate scheduling office to familiarize themselves \nwith  University  policies  governing  the  activity.  Demonstrations,  picketing  or \nrallies must be scheduled in the appropriate scheduling office and may only take \nplace on the northwest corner of McMicken Commons. Anyone requesting to \ndemonstrate, picket or rally must give prior notice of ten (10) working days to the \nUniversity Police. Such activities are not permitted inside any campus building. \nBonfires require additional clearance from the scheduling office, the Department \nof Facilities Management, the Department of Public Safety, and the Cincinnati \nFire Department. \n \n(see Exhibit A, Policy Manual, at 15).  The Uptown West Campus Map shows this area of \nMcMicken Commons.  It is indicated by the green shaded area (see Exhibit B, Uptown West \nCampus Map, modified with color).   \n29.  The terms “demonstration,” “picket,” and “rally” are not defined in the Policy \nManual.  No examples are given of what activities any of these terms encompass or exclude. \n30.  Thus,  the  failure  of  the  Policy  Manual  to  clearly  define  the  terms \n“demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally” means that a person of ordinary intelligence is not afforded \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 9 of 146  PAGEID #: 1430\nthe ability to readily identify the applicable standard for inclusion and exclusion within the \nrequirements of the foregoing policy. \n31.  Furthermore, the failure of the Policy Manual to provide clear standards to guide \nthe discretion of the public officials of the University of Cincinnati as to what activities are \nincluded within the terms “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally” results in enabling such public \nofficials to administer the foregoing policy on the basis of impermissible factors or through \narbitrary application. \n32.  Because the foregoing policy functions as a licensing scheme with which students \nmust comply prior to engaging in the exercise of their free speech rights (notwithstanding that \nthe University of Cincinnati, by the board of trustees‟ own declaration, is dedicated “to providing \nan environment conductive to teaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for truth”), \nthe foregoing policy constitutes a prior restraint on speech. \n33.  Because the foregoing policy requires ten working days‟ advance notice before \nany planned “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally,” a student request for use of the “Free Speech \nArea,” i.e., the northwest corner of McMicken Commons, must be at least fourteen calendar days \nin advance due to intervening weekends not being counted toward the requirement (and even \nlonger if holidays are within the notification period).  \n34.  Because the foregoing policy requires ten working days‟ advance notice before \nany  planned  “demonstration,”  “picket,”  or  “rally,”  the  policy  unconstitutionally  prevents \nspontaneous student expressive activity in response to recent or still-unfolding events, as well as \nevents of a time-sensitive or continuous and ongoing nature. \n35.  On  December  8,  2008,  the  Foundation  for  Individual  Rights  in  Education \n(“FIRE”), a non-partisan, non-profit 501(c)(3) educational foundation dedicated to defending and \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 10 of 146  PAGEID #: 1431\nsustaining freedom of speech at our nation‟s colleges and universities, wrote a letter to the then-\npresident of the University of Cincinnati expressing its concern about the Free Speech Area, the \nnotice requirement, and the threat made in the Policy Manual that “anyone violating this policy \nmay be charged with trespassing” (attached as Exhibit C).  FIRE argued that the University‟s \nrestrictions were unconstitutionally vague and unreasonably restricted student speech in violation \nof the First Amendment. \n36.  On  December  22,  2008,  the  general  counsel  of  the  University  of  Cincinnati \nresponded to FIRE‟s comments with a letter defending the Free Speech Area (attached as Exhibit \nD), asserting that the foregoing policy of the  University of Cincinnati meets  constitutional \nstandards. \n37.  If and only if a student is confident that his speech neither requires security or \ngrounds or is a demonstration, picket, or rally, he still faces a five-day prior restraint on speech in \neach and every traditional and designated public forum on campus:  the MainStreet Student \nEvent Guide provides that “all event requests must be received no later than five business days \nbefore the requested date;” (see MainStreet Student Event Guide, pp. 3, 11, attached as Exhibit J) \nwhile the Use of Facilities Policy Manual similarly imposes, at minimum, a five day prohibition \non spontaneous speech, requiring that students “allow a minimum of five (5) working days notice \nfor a written request.” (see Exhibit A, Policy Manual at p.12) (emphasis added) \n38.  Finally,  signature  gathering  beyond  the  Free  Speech  Zone,  which  is  only \npermitted for students, if at all, at McMicken Commons, TUC Plaza, MainStreet Express Mart \nLobby, and CRC East and West Plazas, (see Exhibit J, MainStreet Student Event Guide at p. 12) \nand thus forbidden on each other public forum articulated above, is governed by the MainStreet \nStudent Event Guide, which specifically states “sales and solicitation events require approval by \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 11 of 146  PAGEID #: 1432\nMainstreet Operations and must be scheduled using the online request form.” (see Exhibit J, \nMainStreet Student Event Guide at p. 11) \n39.  “Solicitation” is defined as “the activity or process of seeking to obtain support of \nan individual for a cause, movement, doctrine, or commercial product through persuasion or \nformal application.”  OAC 3361:10-51-01(A)(1).   \n40.  Defendants‟ litigation  position  that  this  policy  in  only  “intended  to  refer  to \nrequests for commercial sales or solicitations” is in flagrant conflict with the plain language of \nthe UC policy, which explicitly embraces the OAC definition in the section governing “Sales and \nSolicitations.” OAC 3361:10-51-01(A)(1).  Consequently, effectively all signature gathering is \nsubject to UC‟s standardless approval. \n41.  As an additional burden on speech such as signature-gathering and leafleting, UC \n“assigns” students to a single forum at a time, and prohibits “walking around” amongst forums:  \nthe  University  (through  Campus  Scheduling)  was  very  explicit  in  its  email  instructions  to \nPlaintiffs, indicating “you are assigned to the Northwest Corner of McMicken Commons,” and \n“you are not permitted to walk around campus, if we are informed that you are, [the Office of] \nPublic Safety will be contacted.” (see Exhibits G and I).  \n“Current”-Prospective University of Cincinnati Speech Policies \n42.  It is unclear what the status of what Defendants‟ purport to be UC‟s new policies \nis:  both the University President and University General Counsel make unclear statements, \nincluding,  respectively,  that  the  policy  “became  effective  immediately,  and  will  be  fully \nimplemented by May 31, 2012,” and “the University is in the process of implementing those \npolicies, and they will be fully implemented by May 31, 2012. (April 24, 2012 Affidavit of \nGregory  Williams,  attached  to  Defendants‟ Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  as  Exhibit  1, \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 12 of 146  PAGEID #: 1433\nParagraph 8; April 25, 2012 Affidavit of Mitchell McCrate, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for \nSummary Judgment as Exhibit 2,  Paragraph 3).    Meanwhile, the Policy itself states that other \nUC speech policies “are in the process of being harmonized with this policy.”  (UC Expressive \nActivity Policy at p.4, attached to April 24, 2012 Affidavit of Gregory Williams, attached to \nDefendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n43.  UC believes it has the prerogative to declare any part of its campus a “limited \npublic forum.” (UC Expressive Activity Policy at p.2, attached to Affidavit of Gregory Williams \nas Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n44.  UC believes that it has the “prerogative” to limit speech anywhere on campus to \nthe extent that speech may be limited in a “limited public forum.”  (April 24, 2012 Affidavit of \nGregory Williams at Paragraph 7, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as \nExhibit 1). \n45.  UC‟s asserted interest in regulating all student speech is “orderly and safe conduct \nof its [educational] mission.” (UC Expressive Activity Policy at p.2, attached to Affidavit of \nGregory Williams as Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as \nExhibit 1). \n46.  UC‟s new  policy  acknowledged  that  students  have  greater  speech  rights  on \ncampus than do outsiders. \n47.  As to students, the “new” university policy: (1) “requires reasonable notice by \nindividuals and groups requesting the use of a campus location or locations for an expressive \nactivity;” (2) “requires individuals or groups requesting the use of a campus location or locations \nfor an expressive activity to provide the information the university needs to enable it to establish \npeaceful and safe conditions for the activity;” (3) requires students who wish to engaged in a \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 13 of 146  PAGEID #: 1434\n„demonstration‟ or similar activity to “submit a request * * * no fewer than five working days \nbefore the day on which they seek to engage in the activity;” and (4) requires students who wish \nto gather signatures or engage in similar activities to “submit a request * * * no fewer than three \nworking days before the day on which they seek to engage in the activity.” (UC Expressive \nActivity Policy at p.3, attached to Affidavit of Gregory Williams as Exhibit A, attached to \nDefendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n48.  The “new” policy sets forth a procedure for applying for waiver of the three-day \nnotice requirement that applies to all speech throughout campus, stating “a group may request a \nreduction of the three days notice requirement.”  (UC Expressive Activity Policy at p.3, attached \nto Affidavit of Gregory Williams as Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for Summary \nJudgment as Exhibit 1).However, “the university will honor that request” only “if the university \ndetermines that, with the reduced notice, the activity can take place peacefully and safely and in \na manner consistent with the university‟s mission.” (UC Expressive Activity Policy at p.3, \nattached to Affidavit of Gregory Williams as Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for \nSummary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n49.  There are no standards or guidelines go govern the reduction determination, nor \nany specification of who would make this decision.  Likewise, there is no specification of how \nfar in advance of speech a student must apply for the reduction. (UC Expressive Activity Policy \nat p.3, attached to Affidavit of Gregory Williams as Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion \nfor Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n50.  In  addition  to  the  five-day  notice  requirement  for  “demonstrations,” \n“demonstrations” by students are limited to McMicken Commons. (UC Expressive Activity \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 14 of 146  PAGEID #: 1435\nPolicy at p.4, attached to Affidavit of Gregory Williams as Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ \nMotion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n51.  “Demonstrations” include “speechmaking and all other like forms of conduct \nwhich involve the communication or expression of views or grievances, engaged in by one or \nmore persons, the conduct of which has the effect, intent, or propensity to draw a crowd of \nonlookers.” (UC Expressive Activity Policy at p.1, attached to Affidavit of Gregory Williams as \nExhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n52.   The “new” policy does not elaborate on what constitutes “speechmaking,” or the \n“propensity to draw a crowd of onlookers,” or how this would be injurious to the university‟s \nlegitimate interests.  (UC Expressive Activity Policy at p.1, attached to Affidavit of Gregory \nWilliams as Exhibit A, attached to Defendants‟ Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 1). \n53.  Applying the “new” policy, on May 3, 2012, UC denied student Paul Johnson‟s \napplication to gather signatures for Ohio‟s Marriage Freedom Amendment over the course of the \nnext three days (May 4, 5, and 6).  In denying the student‟s request, UC did not invoke or apprise \nthe student of the possibility of waiver of the policy, or consider whether or not the speech would \nbe disruptive, or the number of students who would be engaged in the speech. (see May 3, 2012 \nemail from Campus Scheduling to Paul Johnson, attached as Exhibit K).  \n54.  The  waiver  provision  is  vague,  results  in  undue  administrative  discretion  in \nuniversity employees, and invites discrimination based on content. \nRecurrence \n55.  It is unclear whether UC has repealed its original speech policies in favor of the \npolicy articulated above. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 15 of 146  PAGEID #: 1436\n56.  Defendants have only changed their speech policies in response to this litigation, \nin an attempt to moot it. \n57.  Defendants have vigorously defended the constitutionality of their speech policies \nsince, at minimum, UC General Counsel Mitchell McCrate‟s 2008 letter to the Foundation for \nIndividual Rights in Education, which declares that UC speech policies are constitutional. (see \nExhibit D). \n58.  In  their  Answers  to  Plaintiffs‟  Complaint  and  First  Amended  Complaint, \nDefendants defend their original speech policies, denying that their original speech policies are \nunconstitutional. \n59.  In their April 27, 2012 Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants defend their \noriginal policies as constitutional. \n60.  Defendants have unilateral authority to re-impose their original speech policies, or \nsome derivation thereof, with no structural hurdles. \n61.  Because Defendants believe that any and every space on their campus is a limited \npublic forum, they do not believe that they are bound to implement narrowly-tailored regulations \nthat are not overbroad.  \n62.  Absent injunctive relief from this Court, Defendants are easily able to, and indeed \nlikely to, re-impose their original speech policies or some minor derivation thereof subsequent to \nthis litigation. \nThe Fora at Issue \n63.  The  “northwest  corner  of  McMicken  Commons”  referenced  in  the  foregoing \npolicy of the University of Cincinnati on “Demonstrations, Picketing and Rallies” is demarcated \nin the Policy Manual and referred to as the “Free Speech Area” or “Free Speech Zone”:  “The \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 16 of 146  PAGEID #: 1437\nnorthwest section (see diagram) of McMicken Commons immediately east of McMicken Hall on \nthe West Campus is designated as the main free speech area. Individuals or groups wanting to \nuse these areas must schedule the activity in the Campus Scheduling Office. Anyone violating \nthis policy may be charged with trespassing. No more than one musical or speaking activity is \npermitted at the same time.”  (see Exhibit A, Policy Manual, at 14).  The Free Speech Zone is the \narea immediately east of McMicken Hall.  It is indicated by the green shaded area on Exhibit B, \nthe Uptown West Campus Map.  Exhibit E is a photograph of McMicken Commons modified to \nshow the Free Speech Zone colored red. \n64.  At its longest points, Plaintiffs estimate that the Free Speech Zone is 82 feet east-\nwest and 124 feet north-south. The Free Speech Zone is approximately 10,000 square feet.  The \nWest Campus of the University is 137 acres, or approximately 8,506,833 square feet.  The Free \nSpeech Zone is therefore approximately 0.1% of the total area of West Campus. \n65.  UC‟s Free Speech Zone, a grassy open space between slant walks measuring 82 \nby 124 feet, is a traditional public forum.  First, UC labels it “the Free Speech Zone,” and \ndesignates it as the go-to forum for free speech on campus.  More importantly, the Free Speech \nZone is available to any “individuals or groups wanting to use these areas,” including “groups \nplanning a demonstration, picket or rally.”  (Exhibit A, Policy Manual at pp. 14-15).  Finally, UC \n“grants permission as a matter of course,” as embraced in Perry:  it asserts “if a request is made \nin  compliance  with  the  notice  requirement  and  for  a  University  location  available  to  the \nexpressive activity, the request is to be honored.”  (Defendants‟ Answer to Plaintiff Christopher \nMorbitzer‟s Interrogatory No. 14, attached to Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nas Exhibit A). \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 17 of 146  PAGEID #: 1438\n66.  The West Campus area has many suitable open areas and sidewalks beyond the \nFree Speech Zone where student expressive activity, including petition gathering and political \ndiscussion, will not  interfere with  or disturb access  to UC buildings  or sidewalks, impede \nvehicular or pedestrian traffic, or in any way substantially disrupt the operations of campus or the \nUniversity‟s educational functions. \n67.   Defendants, although in the course of attempting to deny it, effectively admit that \nthe following forums are designated public forums for students, through their admission that \nsuch locations “may be used for student speech”:  Sigma Sigma Commons, Campus Green, \nMcMicken  Commons,  open  spaces  surrounding  Tangeman  University  Center  and  Campus \nRecreation  Center,  Tangeman  University  Center  Plaza,  Bearcat  Plaza,  Bearcat  Pavilion, \nMcMicken Free Speech Zone, Campus Recreation Center West Plaza, and Campus Recreation \nCenter East Plaza.   (Response to Request for Admission No. 4, attached to Plaintiffs‟ Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment as Exhibit C; see also MainStreet Event Guide, attached hereto as \nExhibit J). \n68.  The MainSteet Student Event Guide describes the above MainStreet forums as “a \npedestrian corridor,” and “the hub of campus activity,” that is “available for hosting events.” (see \nMainStreet Student Event Guide at p. 2, attached hereto as Exhibit J). \n69.  UC  streets,  sidewalks,  and  open  spaces  resemble  open  spaces  of  city-owned \nparks, streets, and sidewalks. (see April 26, 2012 Declaration of Christopher Morbitzer, attached \nto Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as Exhibit A). In fact, the sidewalks on \ncampus are wider than typical city sidewalks, and more conductive to free speech such as \nsignature gathering.  (see April 26, 2012 Declaration of Christopher Morbitzer, attached to \nPlaintiffs‟ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as Exhibit A). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 18 of 146  PAGEID #: 1439\n70.  The public sidewalks on campus, upon which students and outsiders walk, are \nmuch wider than regular city sidewalks – from approximately eight feet wide and some over \ntwenty feet wide – and traverse open, rather than narrow, spaces. \n71.  UC  streets,  sidewalks,  and  open  spaces  resemble  open  spaces  of  city-owned \nparks, streets, and sidewalks. In fact, the sidewalks on  campus are wider than typical  city \nsidewalks, and more conducive to free speech such as signature gathering. \n72.  Sigma Sigma Commons is an open area of approximately 4.5 acres to the south of \nCampus Green with a naturally graded outdoor amphitheatre interspersed with heavily traveled \nsidewalks. \n73.  Campus Green is an open park-like area of approximately 6.5 acres to the north of \nSigma Sigma Commons with open lawns, landscaping, green space, benches, and other natural \nfeatures. \n74.  McMicken Commons is an open lawn area of approximately 1.8 acres in between \nMcMicken Hall and Tangeman University Center, the student union. The sidewalks through the \ncenter and to the south of McMicken Commons are heavily traveled, but these do not border the \n“Free Speech Zone,” which is the northwest corner of McMicken Commons. \n75.  “Open spaces surrounding Tangeman University Center and Campus Recreation \nCenter” are wide open paved areas that serve as pedestrian thoroughfares, approximately twenty \nto thirty feet wide and 1,000 feet long, and together help form “MainStreet,” which is the main \nspine of activity on the West Campus. These open spaces also include “Tangeman University \nCenter Plaza,” “Bearcat Plaza,” “Bearcat Pavilion,” “Campus Recreation Center West Plaza,” \nand “Campus Recreation Center East Plaza.” Benches and tables are placed in unobtrusive \nlocations along the edges of these open spaces, and large steps form an amphitheatre to the east \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 19 of 146  PAGEID #: 1440\nof Tangeman University Center. Areas to the south and west of the Campus Recreation Center \nare canopied and are among the only outdoor areas on campus sheltered from rain. \n76.  At  each  of  these  locations,  Mr.  Morbitzer  has  personally  observed  students \nengaging expressive activity, including, but not limited to, one-on-one speech. \nPlaintiffs’ Speech and the University’s Response \n77.  On February 9, 2012, the Ohio Ballot Board approved language for a ballot \nmeasure proposing an amendment to the Ohio Constitution titled “To guarantee the freedom of \nOhioans to choose whether to participate in a labor organization as a condition of employment” \n(“the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment”).   \n78.  The approval by the Ohio Ballot Board thus cleared the way for signatures to be \ngathered to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the ballot to be voted on by the \nvoters of Ohio. \n79.  On  Monday,  February  13,  2012,  backers  of  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom \nAmendment finalized the petition and made it available for download and circulation. \n80.  Plaintiffs  desire  to  gather  signatures  to  place  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom \nAmendment on the ballot, and in the process, to discuss the initiative with their classmates on \ncampus and to advocate for the passage of the initiative itself.  Doing so would be consistent \nwith the University of Cincinnati‟s designation of its campus as an “environment conductive to \nteaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \n81.  To qualify for placement on the November 2012 ballot, supporters of the Ohio \nWorkplace Freedom Amendment need to obtain over 385,000 valid signatures on petitions no \nlater than July 9, 2012 (120 days prior to the November 2012 elections).  \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 20 of 146  PAGEID #: 1441\n82.  Due to invalid signatures that inevitably occur during an initiative petition effort \n(due to various reasons), significantly more than 385,000 signatures will be necessary in order to \nmeet the requisite number of valid signatures.  By way of example, the recently successful Ohio \nHealth Care Freedom Amendment that passed in November 2011 was also put on the ballot via \ninitiative  petitions;  supporters  of  that  initiative  submitted  546,074  signatures  to  the  Ohio \nSecretary of State of which only 426,998 signatures were verified as valid. \n83.  Given  this  deadline  for  the  petition,  on  each  occasion  when  Plaintiffs  are \nunlawfully and unconstitutionally prevented from collecting signatures and advocating for the \npassage of the initiative, not only does a violation of their constitutional rights take place, but the \nlikelihood that the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment will be on the November 2012 ballot \nis reduced. \n84.  Plaintiffs  wish  to  engage  in  further  political  speech  beyond  just  signature \ngathering, including speech that could be characterized as a “demonstration,” under either the \nformer, current, or prospective policies.   \n85.  In  reaction  to  the  news  of  the  Ballot  Board‟s  approval  to  begin  collecting \nsignatures,  Mr.  Morbitzer  immediately  sent  an  email  on  February  9,  2012  to  the  relevant \nauthorities at the University of Cincinnati (via the email address “campusscheduling@uc.edu”) \nrequesting  permission  to  collect  signatures  and  asking  for  clarification  of  the  University‟s \npolicies  classifying  expressive  activity  as  a  “demonstration,  picket,  or  rally”  and  therefore \nlimited to the Free Speech Area (attached as Exhibit F). \n86.  At 8:05 a.m. on the next day, February 10, 2012, Mr. Morbitzer received an \nunsigned  email  response  from  “Conference  &  Event  Services”  via  the  email  address \n“campusscheduling@uc.edu.” The response failed to  expressly  clarify  the University policy \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 21 of 146  PAGEID #: 1442\nregarding the definitions of a “demonstration, picket, or rally”; told Mr. Morbitzer to “use the \nonline form to request use of McMicken Commons Northwest Corner”; and threatened police \naction if the Plaintiffs were seen merely “walk[ing] around campus” engaging in expressive \nactivity outside of the Free Speech Area (attached as Exhibit G). \n87.  The response from “Conference & Event Services” to Mr. Morbitzer on February \n10, 2012, was sent by Brian Short. \n88.  The response from “Conference & Event Services”  to Mr. Morbitzer on February \n10, 2012, implied that Plaintiffs‟ desired expressive activity, i.e., petition circulating, was within \nthe scope of the term “demonstration, picket, or rally.” \n89.  In response, Mr. Morbitzer requested permission via the online form on February \n10, 2012.  However, the form failed to provide Mr. Morbitzer and UC YAL with the option of \nrequesting permission to engage in their desired expressive activity on campus immediately.   \n90.  Contrary to the University‟s Policy Manual, which requires “prior notice of ten \n(10) working days” before engaging in expressive activity deemed a “demonstration, picket, or \nrally” in the Free Speech Zone, the online form stated that  “[o]utdoor spaces must be requested \nat least 15 days in advance of the event” (attached as Exhibit H).  No explanation of this \ndiscrepancy is given in the Policy Manual.   \n91.  In an additional email response to Plaintiffs‟ request from Ms. Sisko on Friday, \nFebruary 10 (a copy of which is attached as Exhibit I), Mr. Morbitzer‟s request was approved \nonly to the extent Plaintiffs remained at all times in the Free Speech Zone: \nHello Christopher, \n \nPlease see your event confirmation below. You have been assigned the North-\nWest corner of McMicken Commons, however you are not permitted to walk \naround. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 22 of 146  PAGEID #: 1443\n \nAlso note, that your event was approved despite our 5 Day Business Policy. In the \nfuture, this will not be allowed. Therefore, make sure you put your event request \nin 5 Business Days before your desired date. \n \nReview  the  Event  Guide  and  Policies  link  below  for  important  policies  and \nprocesses involved with your scheduled space.  \nhttp://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/eventservices/docs/Confirmation%20Notice.P\nolicy%20and%20Process.pdf \n \nIf you have any questions please contact Conference & Event Services at 556-\n2442. \n \nThank you, \nConference & Event Services \n \n92.  The approval restricted Plaintiffs‟ expressive activity to the Free Speech Zone \n(“the North-West corner of McMicken Commons”) and once again noted Plaintiffs “are not \npermitted  to  walk  around.”    This  response  indicated  that  Defendants  construed  the  terms \n“demonstration, picket, or rally” to include expressive activity like the signature gathering, \nadvocacy, and discussion in which Plaintiffs sought to engage. \n93.  This email response refers to a notification period of five business days, while the \nUse of Facilities Policy Manual refers to ten working days, and the online form refers to fifteen \ndays.  No explanation of this discrepancy is given in the Policy Manual.   \n94.  The  requirement  of  five,  ten,  or  fifteen  days  notice  unreasonably  prevents \nspontaneous expressive activities in response to recent or still-unfolding events, as well as those \nof a time-sensitive nature. For example, it would have been impossible for University students to \ngather spontaneously to demonstrate their shock and sadness following the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2011, or their support of the United States‟ successful military operation in killing \nOsama Bin Laden, without violating University policy.  \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 23 of 146  PAGEID #: 1444\n95.  Furthermore, the lack of clarity with regard to which of the three notice periods is \napplicable breeds confusion and uncertainty amongst would-be student speakers, resulting in an \nimpermissible chilling effect on campus and the arbitrary and capricious enforcement of the \npolicy. \nBurdens on Speech \n96.  The notice requirements mean that each and every gathering of a signatures, and \nindeed each signature itself, faces a potential delay of anywhere between three and  fourteen \ncalendar  days  (or  more  if  there  are  intervening  holidays  during  the  notification  period), \ndepending on the location on campus and applicable policy. \n97.  The notice requirement prohibits spontaneous speech in response to the actions of \nthe Ballot Board, which substantially burdens the Plaintiffs‟ First Amendment rights and leads to \na delay in petition gathering and advocacy for the issue.  \n98.  The requirement continues to prohibit spontaneous speech, preventing UC YAL \nfrom gathering signatures when a conversation evokes the interest of a fellow student who may \nwish to sign a petition. \n99.  Limiting petition  gathering and  advocacy substantially burdens the Plaintiffs‟ \nFirst Amendment rights and significantly restricts the number of signatures that may be gathered \nto place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the November 2012 ballot. \n100.  Prohibiting non-disruptive signature gathering for three days from each request is \nnot narrowly tailored to advance UC‟s educational mission, nor to ensure safety. \n101.  Significantly limiting locations on campus where students may engage in non-\ndisruptive  speech  constituting  a  “demonstration”  is  not  narrowly  tailored  advance  UC‟s \neducational mission, nor to ensure safety.   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 24 of 146  PAGEID #: 1445\n102.  UC‟s location restrictions and notice requirements – past, present, and prospective \n– are not narrowly tailored, and are overly broad, insofar as they prohibit a significant amount of \nprotected speech in their efforts to address unprotected speech. \nCausation \n103.  As a direct and proximate result of the denial by Brittany Sisko of their request to \nimmediately gather signatures, to advocate for the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment, and to \ndiscuss the initiative‟s merits with their fellow students, Plaintiffs‟ constitutional rights have \nbeen violated and Plaintiffs have suffered injury and damages. \n104.  The  actions  of  Defendant  Brittany  Sisko  in  denying  Plaintiffs‟  request  to \nimmediately gather signatures, to advocate for the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment, and to \ndiscuss the initiative‟s merits with their fellow students was the direct and proximate result of the \npolicy, practice and custom of the University of Cincinnati as adopted and implemented by \nDefendants. \n105.  As a direct  and proximate result of  Defendant  Brittany Sisko restricting and \nconfining the Plaintiffs only within the Free Speech Zone in order to engage in the initiative \npetition effort, Plaintiffs‟ constitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered \ninjury and damages. \n106.  The actions of Defendant Brittany Sisko in restricting and confining the Plaintiffs \nonly within the Free Speech Zone in order to engage in the initiative petition effort was the direct \nand proximate result of the policy, practice and custom of the University of Cincinnati as \nadopted and implemented by one or more of the Defendants. \n107.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  the \nUniversity  of  Cincinnati  as  adopted  and  implemented  by  one  or  more  of  the  Defendants, \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 25 of 146  PAGEID #: 1446\nPlaintiffs‟ constitutional  rights  have  been  violated  and  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  injury  and \ndamages. \n108.  Defendants unambiguously acknowledge that low-level student employees are left \nto work out the vagueries of UC speech policies, as in this case, they concede that Ms. Sisko was \n“the primary person responsible for the decision to assign Plaintiffs‟ signature gathering to the \nFree Speech Area.” (Answer to Morbitzer Interrogatory No. 10, attached to Plaintiffs‟ Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment as Exhibit A). \n109.  Ms. Sisko did not confer with anyone prior to copying security on the email, \nincluding  security,  i.e.  Defendants  Shemak  and/or  Krumpelbeck.  (Answer  to  Morbitzer \nInterrogatory Nos. 15, 3, 10, 16, 17, attached to Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nas Exhibit A).       \n110.  Defendants acknowledge that their low-level employees, charged with enforcing \nspeech policies, receive no training on how to do so. (Answer to Morbitzer Interrogatory No. 14, \nattached to Plaintiffs‟ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as Exhibit A). \n111.  Meanwhile,  Defendants  concede  “Ms.  Sisko  [and  Mr.  Short]  acted  in \nconformance with the University‟s policies,” and “Ms. Sisko was acting in conformance with \nUniversity policy if, by information Plaintiffs that „you are not permitted to walk around,‟ she \nmeant that Plaintiffs were required to collect signatures in the locations they had requested.”  \n(Answer  to  Morbitzer  Interrogatory  No.  8,  12(a),  attached  to  Plaintiffs‟ Motion  for  Partial \nSummary Judgment as Exhibit A). \nDefendants’ Inconsistent Application of the Policy at Issue \n112.  As mentioned above, Defendants seemingly maintain three different notification \nperiods for the same types of expressive activity: five, ten, or fifteen days. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 26 of 146  PAGEID #: 1447\n113.  Defendants have also been inconsistent in how they define an expressive activity \nas a “demonstration, picket or rally” that is therefore limited to the Free Speech Zone only. \n114.  For example, in October 2011 and the autumn of 2008, Mr. Morbitzer witnessed \nindividuals engaged in voter registration throughout the grounds of West Campus.  They were \nnot limited to the Free Speech Zone. \n115.  Similarly, in the spring of 2009, Mr. Morbitzer witnessed individuals gathering \nsignatures throughout the grounds of West Campus for a proposed amendment to the Ohio \nConstitution to legalize casino gambling.  They were not limited to the Free Speech Zone. \n116.  On information and belief, these signature gathering, advocacy, and discussion \nactivities were not classified as a “demonstration, picket, or rally,” while Plaintiffs‟ identical \nactivity was so classified and was therefore restricted to the Free Speech Zone. \n117.  Based upon information and belief, officials within the University of Cincinnati \nwere aware of such First Amendment activities freely taking place outside the Free Speech Zone, \nyet no action was taken to confine such activities within the Free Speech Zone. \n118.  In fact, based upon information and belief, officials within the University of \nCincinnati actively supported or condoned such First Amendment activities freely taking place \noutside the Free Speech Zone. \n119.  To the extent officials within the University of Cincinnati actively supported or \ncondoned such First Amendment activities freely taking place outside the Free Speech Zone, the \nrestriction of the Plaintiffs to the Free Speech Zone for their initiative petition effort constituted \nunconstitutional discrimination based upon the content or viewpoint of the speaker. \n \n \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 27 of 146  PAGEID #: 1448\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTION \n(28 U.S.C. § 2201, et seq.) \n120.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n121.  An  actual  controversy  has  arisen  and  now  exists  between  Plaintiffs  and \nDefendants  concerning  Plaintiffs‟ rights  under  the  United  States  Constitution.    A  judicial \ndeclaration is necessary and appropriate at this time as to Counts I through II.   \n122.  Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights against Defendants as they \npertain to Plaintiffs‟ right to speak, assemble, and gather signatures on petitions on the outdoor \nareas campus of the University of Cincinnati without being subjected to a prior restraint or “time, \nplace,  and  manner”  regulations  which  are  unreasonable,  not  content  neutral,  not  narrowly \ntailored to serve a substantial government interest, and do not leave open ample alternative \nchannels of communication. \n123.  In  order  to  prevent  further  violation  of  Plaintiffs‟  constitutional  rights  by \nDefendants, it is appropriate and proper that a declaratory judgment be issued, pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201 and FED. R. CIV. P. 57, declaring unconstitutional the University‟s policies. \n124.  Furthermore,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2202  and  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  65,  it  is \nappropriate and hereby requested that this Court issue preliminary and permanent injunctions \nprohibiting the Defendants from enforcing their restrictions on Plaintiffs‟ expressive activities to \nthe extent they are unconstitutional, in order to prevent the ongoing violation of Plaintiffs‟ \nconstitutional rights. \n \n \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 28 of 146  PAGEID #: 1449\n \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH UNDER \nTHE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n125.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein.  \n126.  The University of Cincinnati is a state actor.  See Thomson v. Harmony, 65 F.3d \n1314, 1319 (6th Cir. 1995) (“The University of Cincinnati is a state instrumentality”); Hall v. \nMedical  College  of  Ohio, 742  F.2d  299,  303–04  (6th  Cir.  1984)  (discussing  how  state \nuniversities in Ohio, including University of Cincinnati, are considered “arms of the state”). \n127.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, each and all of the acts \nalleged herein were attributed to one or more of the Defendants acting under the color, authority, \nand pretense of state law, statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs, usages, and policies of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati. \n128.  Soliciting and gathering signatures on a petition is core political speech protected \nby the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 422 \nn.5, 425 (1988). \n129.  The First and Fourteenth Amendments extend to campuses of state universities.  \nHealy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972). \n130.  A traditional public forum like a park or public sidewalk is subject to reasonable \n“time, place and manner” restrictions that are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government \ninterest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.  Perry Educ. Ass’n v. \nPerry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 29 of 146  PAGEID #: 1450\n131.  A designated public forum is a forum the government intentionally opens to \nexpressive activity to the public at large.  Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 534 (6th Cir. \n2010).  The standards governing restrictions on speech are the same as a traditional public forum.  \nPleasant Grove v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 469–70 (2009). \n132.  “The campus of a public university, at least for its students, possesses many of the \ncharacteristics of a public forum.”  Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 267 n.5 (1981). \n133.  Thus, the campus of the University of Cincinnati (or, at least, areas other than the \nFree Speech Area) constitute traditional and designated public fora in which students, including \nPlaintiffs, are entitled to engage in speech protected under the First Amendment.   \n134.  Restrictions on speech in such forums must be narrowly tailored, must provide \nample alternative outlets for speech, and must not be overly-broad. \n135.  Defendants have and continue to violate Plaintiffs‟ constitutional right to engage \nin  political  speech  with  fellow  students  where  they  prohibit  speech  they  characterize  as \n“demonstrations” on parts of campus that are or resemble traditional and designated public fora \nas to students. \n136.  Defendants have and continue to violate Plaintiffs‟ constitutional right to engage \nin  political  speech  with  fellow  students  where  they  prohibit,  without  prior  permission,  all \npolitical speech by students in parts of campus that are or resemble traditional and designated \npublic fora as to students. \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 30 of 146  PAGEID #: 1451\n137.  The  policies  and  actions  of  Defendants  vest  unfettered  discretion  in  the \nDefendants to restrict constitutionally protected expression. \n138.  The policies and actions of Defendants are prior restraints and restrictions on \nspeech in campus areas that are commonly considered traditional or designated public fora. \n139.  The Defendants‟ purported “time, place and manner” restrictions are unreasonable \nin light of the purpose of the forum, overly broad, not content-neutral, are not narrowly tailored \nto serve significant government interests, and do not leave open ample alternative channels of \ncommunication. \n140.  As a proximate result of Defendants‟ actions, Plaintiffs have been irreparably \ninjured, and will continue in the future to be irreparably injured, in that they have been and will \nbe deprived of their right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nConstitution.  \n141.  As a direct result of the Defendants‟ speech policies, Plaintiffs continue to be \nprohibited from engaging their fellow students in discussion, advocating on behalf of their \npolitical beliefs, and collecting sufficient signatures to successfully place the Ohio Workplace \nFreedom Amendment on the November 2012 ballot. \n142.  As  a  legal  consequence  of  the  Defendants‟ violation  of  Plaintiffs‟ First  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as alleged above, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and, \nfrom Ms. Sisko, to recover nominal damages. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 31 of 146  PAGEID #: 1452\nCOUNT II \n \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS \nUNDER THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n  \n143.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n144.  Due process requires that a state enactment be held void for vagueness if the \nprohibitive terms are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary intelligence can readily \nidentify the applicable standard for inclusion and exclusion.  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 \nU.S. 104, 108 (1972). \n145.  The absence of clear standards guiding the discretion of the public official vested \nwith the authority to enforce the enactment invites abuse by enabling the official to administer \nthe policy on the basis of impermissible factors.  Leonardson v. City of East Lansing, 896 F.2d \n190, 198 (6th Cir. 1990). \n146.  The vagueness doctrine “requires that the limits the [government] claims are \nimplicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or administrative \nconstruction, or well-established practice.”  City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ’g Co., 486 \nU.S. 750, 770 (1988). \n147.  The policies and conduct of Defendants are unconstitutionally vague on their face.  \nThey fail to adequately advise, notify, or inform students threatened with disciplinary action and \ncriminal prosecution for violation, and thus have a chilling effect on speech. \n148.  The Defendants‟ policy, practice, and custom of limiting the expressive activities \non campus it defines as constituting a “demonstration, picket, or rally” to the Free Speech Zone \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 32 of 146  PAGEID #: 1453\nis  unconstitutional  and violates  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United States \nConstitution. \n149.  The  Defendants‟ policy,  practice  and  custom  of  allowing  its  agents  or  other \nauthorized individuals unbridled discretion in determining which expressive activities constitute \na “demonstration, picket, or rally” – and thus are subject to the notification requirement of ten \nworking days and limited to the Free Speech Zone – violates Plaintiffs‟ rights under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n150.  UC‟s new policies are vague, require discretion, and impose arbitrariness.  \n151.  As a proximate result of Defendants‟ actions, Plaintiffs have been irreparably \ninjured, and will continue in the future to be irreparably injured, in that they have been and will \nbe deprived of their right to free speech and due process of law under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the Constitution.  \n152.  As a direct result of the Defendants‟ violation of the Plaintiffs‟ constitutional \nrights,  Plaintiffs  are  at  continued  risk  of  being  unable  to  engage  their  fellow  students  in \ndiscussion, advocate on behalf of their political  beliefs, and collect  sufficient  signatures to \nsuccessfully place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the November 2012 ballot. \n153.  As  a  legal  consequence  of  the  Defendants‟ violation  of  Plaintiffs‟ First  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as alleged above, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and, \nfrom Defendant Brittany Sisko, to recover nominal damages. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants and that the Court: \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 33 of 146  PAGEID #: 1454\n(1) Declare that the notice requirements, location restrictions and forum designations in \nthe  University  of  Cincinnati‟s  past,  current,  and  prospective  speech  policies, \nincluding but not limited to the Use of Facilities Policy Manual, the MainStreet \nStudent Event Guide and April 24, 2012 policies, are unconstitutional on their face \nbecause  they  violate  the  rights  to  freedom  of  speech  and  due  process  of  law \nguaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution; \n(2) Declare that the notice requirements, location restrictions and forum designations in \nthe  University  of  Cincinnati‟s  past,  current,  and  prospective  speech  policies, \nincluding but not limited to the Use of Facilities Policy Manual, the MainStreet \nStudent Event Guide and April 24, 2012 policies, are unconstitutional. \n(3) Issue a permanent injunction against the Defendants prohibiting the enforcement of \nsaid  policies  against  Plaintiffs  and  others  who  seek  to  participate  in  expressive \nactivities both within the Free Speech Area and on sidewalks and outdoor open areas \nsuch as those described in this Complaint;  \n(4) Award Plaintiffs nominal damages against Defendant Brittany Sisko; \n(5) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988 and other applicable law, award Plaintiffs their costs and \nexpenses incurred in bringing this action, including their reasonable attorneys‟ fees; \nand \n(6) Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable, just, and proper. \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Maurice A.

As with all state, federal and local entities, “public” \ndoes not mean that all areas are open to the general public.   The are some areas, such as sport \nand performing arts venues, shops and restaurants, where access by the general public is \npermitted, and in many cases, encouraged.  On the other hand, classrooms, laboratories, \nacademic offices, student lounges and other educational and research venues are not open to the \ngeneral public but are for the most part limited to the use of faculty, students, staff and invited \nguests who have business related to the mission of the University (the “University Community”).  \n \nWhen a building contains areas that are designated as open to the general public, access is \nlimited to those areas and only during specified hours.  Unless otherwise posted, most public \naccess areas are accessible by the general public during normal business hours (Monday – Friday \nfrom 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM).  During other days and/or hours, all areas in the building are \nrestricted to the University Community. \n \nAs noted above, there are some exceptions to this restriction; such as when a public event is \nbeing held in a university building; e.g. CCM performances, athletic events, meetings open to the \npublic, etc., or when a building contains areas intended for public/guest/alumni use; e.g. \nbookstores, libraries, restaurants, recreation areas, etc.   \n \nThere are some facilities that are restricted, even during normal business hours, and not all areas \nof the University are open to all members of the University Community. These areas are posted \nand/or locked. (Access to residence halls is restricted at all hours to residents, registered guests \nand authorized staff.)  \n \n \nUse of Storage Facilities on Campus \nThe University of Cincinnati does not permit use of any storage areas or facilities (such as \nlockers, cabinets, etc.) by anyone without express permission.  Items found stored in violation of \nthis section of the Use of Facilities Policy Manual will be confiscated and disposed of in \naccordance with the law concerning found property and/or contraband, as indicated by the type \nof property. \n \n \n  3\n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:21-2c-vc-v0-00105155-5T-SMBR DBo Dc o#c:  #6:9 1 F-1ile Fdi:l e0d6:/ 1022//1222 /P12a gPea: g3e9:  o4f  o1f4 663   P PAAGGEEIDID # #: :1 34260\n \nGENERAL POLICIES PERTAINING TO THE USE OF UNIVERSITY FACILITIES \nThe policies stated herein were developed by the Use of Facilities Policy Committee.  They were \napproved by the Academic and Administrative Councils and the President of the University of \nCincinnati and are administered and interpreted by the appropriate scheduling office.  Appeals \nrelated to the application of these policies are to be referred to the Use of Facilities Policy \nCommittee for review.  These policies are not applicable to the Housing and Food Services \nOffice or Hospital patient care areas which have their own separate policies. \nThe facilities of the University are the property of the State of Ohio, and are subject to all \napplicable state laws, rules and regulations.  \nNon-University individuals or groups can schedule use of University facilities within certain \nlimitations. \nThe following priority is used for scheduling facilities: \n1.  Academic classes \n2.  Academic related activities \n3.  Activities sponsored or co-sponsored by the University of a University group. \n4.  Activities sponsored by a non-University group. \n \nA non-University group may reserve facilities only if comparable facilities are not available \ncommercially elsewhere in the local community.  Requests by non-University groups for use of \nUniversity facilities for activities which are in competition with the University’s educational or \ncultural offerings (classes, seminars, etc.), are not approved.  Determination of whether \ncompetition exists is decided by the appropriate scheduling office in consultation with academic \nand administrative units. \nThe University of Cincinnati reserves the right to change facility assignments or to cancel any \npreviously scheduled facility if such change or cancellation is made to meet University needs.  \nThe University is not responsible for any costs or damages suffered by a sponsoring group as a \nresult of such change or cancellation. \nResponsibilities of All Groups/Individuals Using University Facilities \nThe sponsor must conduct an event in a manner that complies with all policies regarding the use \nof University facilities.  The sponsor assumes total responsibility including, but not limited to \nfinancial and legal obligations for an event using University facilities.  Specific smoking and use \nof alcohol regulations apply to University facilities and are detailed in Appendices B and C.  \nGroups and individuals who sponsor an event are responsible for any loss or damage incurred by \nthe University resulting from their occupancy of University facilities. \n \nRental Charges and Expenses \nA standard rental charge is made for the use of University facilities by a non-University group.  \nNo rental charge is made for the use of facilities for an event sponsored by the University or a \nUniversity group held during hours when campus buildings are regularly open unless admission \nis charged or donations are requested.  No rental charges are made for the use of facilities for \nevents if the University is compensated through other direct methods, i.e., tuition, fees and/or \n  4\n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:21-2c-vc-v0-00105155-5T-SMBR DBo Dc o#c:  #6:9 1 F-1ile Fdi:l e0d6:/ 1022//1222 /P12a gPea: g4e0:  o5f  o1f4 663   P PAAGGEEIDID # #: :1 34361\ngrants.  Rental charges may be obtained from the appropriate scheduling office.  Student \norganizations sponsoring events involving admission charges or donations must obtain approval \nof the Student Activities and Leadership Development’s Financial Advisor.  All rental charges \nare payable two weeks in advance of the event.  Charges are assessed to all groups for direct \nexpenses incurred as a result of occupancy beyond regular hours, special equipment, set-ups, \nservices, and personnel required to service an event.  All charges are based on the University \nSchedule of Charges for Use of Facilities on file in the appropriate scheduling offices.  Requests \nfor exceptions to established charges or advance payment are referred to the Use of Facilities \nPolicy Committee. \nPayment of all charges for the use of University facilities and services is the responsibility of the \ngroup and/or the agent representing the group.  If the group does not meet its financial \nobligations to the University, the individual who requested use of facility is responsible for the \npayment.  University groups which co-sponsor an event with a non-University group or \norganization are responsible for any financial and legal obligations incurred if not settled by the \nnon-University group.  Non-University groups must pay all outstanding charges within thirty \n(30) days following issuance by the University of a Statement of charges incurred unless \notherwise stipulated in a signed contract. \nSafety and Security \nDue to fire safety and building code regulations, stairways and corridors within buildings may \nnot be used as gathering places or for holding events.  Security requirements for all events using \nUniversity facilities are determined by the University Department of Public Safety.  Compliance \nwith all safety and security laws is the responsibility of the sponsoring group or individual, but \nthe University Police have the ultimate authority to insure compliance with all rules, regulations \nand laws.  Persons present on University property are subject to the authority of the University \nPolice.  Non-University groups must obtain and maintain public liability insurance covering \nbodily injury and property damage in an amount to be determined by the appropriate scheduling \noffice.  A security deposit may be required. \nThe authority to determine the number of police/security personnel assigned to an event, their \npost/are of assignment, and their duties rests with the Department of Public Safety. \nThe University Police Officer assigned to an event shall insure compliance with safety rules, \nregulations, and laws.  The use of firearms (including blanks), explosives, and/or pyrotechnics is \nprohibited without the express written permission of the Department of Public Safety. \n \nPolitical Programs and Activities \nUniversity groups may sponsor a political candidate for speaking engagements only.  University \nfacilities may not be used for political fundraising activities where solicitations of funds, \ndonations or similar activities take place.  No solicitation of funds may take place for the benefit \nof the sponsoring political organization and/or the political candidate.  University facilities are \nnot available to non-University groups for partisan political programs, receptions, fundraisers or \nsimilar activities. \n  5\n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:21-2c-vc-v0-00105155-5T-SMBR DBo Dc o#c:  #6:9 1 F-1ile Fdi:l e0d6:/ 1022//1222 /P12a gPea: g4e1:  o6f  o1f4 663   P PAAGGEEIDID # #: :1 34462\n \nFundraising \nServices of facilities are not available for fundraising purposes if the funds are designed solely to \nenrich an individual or commercial sponsor.  This does not preclude fundraising activities in \nsupport of University groups or organizations. \nDistribution of Printed Materials, Publicity, Promotional Methods, Posted Materials \nIndividuals wanting to distribute printed materials on the West Campus grounds must first \nschedule the activity/distribution points in the Campus Scheduling Office.  Distribution to the \nUniversity community of printed materials, including fliers, handbills, and announcements, is \nlimited to the northwest section of Mc Micken Commons, the sidewalk in front of Baldwin and \nthe angled sidewalk on Sigma Sigma Commons (see diagram).  In the interests of patient care, no \ndistribution of printed materials is allowed on East Campus grounds. \nDistribution must be done in an orderly manner and must not interrupt traffic on campus or \notherwise interfere with the normal use of the area.  Material distributed must have the name of \nthe sponsoring person or group clearly indicated on the material.  Individuals distributing printed \nmaterials are responsible for cleaning up debris in the areas affected.  Non-University literature \nmay be distributed to University employees only during the employees’ non-working time and in \nnon-working areas with prior approval from Campus Scheduling on the northwest corner of \nMcMicken Commons. \nAdvertising and promotional literature of events sponsored or co-sponsored by a University \ngroup must identify the specific University Department or Organization.  All such material must \nbe approved by the sponsor or co-sponsor prior to publication.  Non-University groups may not \nuse the University name, seal, logo, or other University identification in any advertising or \npromotional literature, except to note location of the event. \nAny publicity within campus buildings must be registered by the appropriate office and/or \nperson responsible for each bulletin board in the building.  Posting is permitted on specified \nbulletin boards ONLY, not on walls or glass.  Posters/fliers must be in reference to a University \nevent or activity and must clearly state the name of the sponsoring group or organization.  \nPosters/fliers must be removed immediately following the event. \n \nBulletin Boards \nAvailable West Campus Bulletin Board locations are on file at the Campus Scheduling Office.  \nEast Campus locations can be obtained from the appropriate Dean’s or Departmental office.  \nPriority is assigned in the following order. \n1.  Official University events or activities \n2.  Events or activities sponsored by a recognized University group or unit. \n3.  Events or activities co-sponsored by a recognized University group or unit. \n4.  Events or activities sponsored by a non-University group, which may be of benefit or \ninterest to the campus community.  Materials in this category are considered only if \nthey do not conflict with University events and if space is available. \n \n  6\n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:21-2c-vc-v0-00105155-5T-SMBR DBo Dc o#c:  #6:9 1 F-1ile Fdi:l e0d6:/ 1022//1222 /P12a gPea: g4e2:  o7f  o1f4 663   P PAAGGEEIDID # #: :1 34563\n \nBanners \nBanners advertising University events or sales that are scheduled in the Campus Scheduling \nOffice can be displayed.

Banners must be attractive, in good taste, and of general interest to the campus \ncommunity.  Banners carrying the name of an individual aspiring to an elected position not \ndirectly connected with the University are not permitted. \nRecruiting and Information Tables \nRecruiting activities are scheduled through the appropriate scheduling office.  When scheduling \nthe event, the group is referred to the college office of each academic buildings involved to \nobtain approval.  If the college office personnel determine the dissemination of information at \nthe point desired interferes with traffic or internally planned programs, they may refuse the \nrequest.  Groups scheduling recruiting activities in buildings other than Tangeman University \nCenter furnish their own tables and chairs. \nSales and Solicitation of Funds \nGroups wishing to conduct sales, or solicit funds must file a written application for approval with \nthe Chair of the University Committee On Sales and Solicitation of Funds, and must adhere to \nthe policies and rules contained in the University Sales and Solicitation Policy.

Sales may not \nbe conducted in competition with the usual business of the University of its Departments.  All \nsales and solicitation for funds shall be consistent with the educational and public responsibilities \nof the University. \nGambling \nGambling is prohibited on or within University buildings and grounds.  Under the Ohio Revised \nCode, raffles may be allowed if they are conducted by organizations having 501 C (3) \nexemptions from the IRS.

Requests for reservations during times when a facility is not scheduled for \nUniversity sponsored events are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis. \nWest Campus \nThe Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling, maintains the central file of \nsome general purpose classrooms and seminar rooms and has scheduling authority in the rooms \nMonday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  This Division schedules rooms for the \nMcMicken College of Arts and Sciences, the University College, the College of Education, the \nCollege of Engineering and the School of Social Work., This Division also schedules some space \nin the College of Business Administration, and the College of Design, Art, Architecture, and \nPlanning.  The College Conservatory of Music and the College of Law facilities are scheduled in \ntheir respective college offices.  The College of Business Administration schedules academic \nspace in Lindner Hall until class orders are submitted, then the Division of Registration and \nScheduling assumes scheduling responsibility.  The College of Design, Art, Architecture and \nPlanning schedules use of its academic space with some assistance from the Division of \nRegistration and Scheduling.  The Campus Scheduling Office schedules the use of academic \nspace for conferences, meeting and events when class is not in session and on weekends.   The \nDivision of Registration and Scheduling coordinates the scheduling of academic space for other \ncourses convening after 6:30 p.m. \nEast Campus \nCollege of Medicine facilities in the Health Professions Building and the Medical Sciences \nBuilding may be used only when scheduled and confirmed in advance.  An Application to \nSchedule Facilities must be completed for each event and submitted to the Medical Art and \nDesign Services (MADS) for approval.  Consideration for the use of facilities is given to \ncomplete, signed, written applications only.  No oral requests will be honored.  Final approval \nand rental charges for the use of facilities are based on the type and scope of the event, the \nfinancial arrangements, and the department or organization responsible for the event.  Facilities \nare reserved “as is.”  No arrangement of equipment, personnel, or services is included or implied \nwith the confirmation of any College of Medicine facility.  Facilities are not officially reserved \nuntil a signed confirmation copy of the application is received by the applicant from MADS. \nCollege of Medicine academic classes and exams have the highest priority and supercede all \nother use of facilities.  Monday-Friday 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., facilities are reserved exclusively \nfor academic classes and exams, College of Medicine, Medical Center and University sponsored \nevents only.  Non-University events are not scheduled in the facilities during the academic day.  \nAfter 6:00 p.m.  Monday-Friday, and on weekends, consideration is given to non-University \nsponsored events for the use of Kresge Auditorium or Classroom E-351 only.  No other College \nof Medicine facility is available for non-University events at any time. \nThe Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing each schedule the use of their own facilities at the \nrespective college office.  Room reservations for the College of Pharmacy required courses,  \n  9\n\nCCaasese: :1 1:1:122-c-vc-v0-000115555-T-MSBR BD oDco #c :# 6: 91 -F1il eFdil:e 0d6: /0122//2122/ 1P2a Pgea:g 4e5:  1o0f  1o4f 66 3 P  PAAGGEEIDID # :# 1: 43686\n \nelective courses, seminars, and other programs are scheduled in preference to all other room \nreservation requests.  Room reservations for the College of Nursing and Health must be made as \nfar in advance as possible.  Room assignments are made in a manner that will accommodate the \nnumber of students and best utilize the Procter Hall facilities.  College of Nursing Health \nfacilities may be reserved for conferences, meetings, or other special purposes on a one-time \nonly basis.  These reservations must be made far enough in advance to avoid conflict in \nscheduling.  Requests for special arrangements of chairs, tables, etc., must be made two weeks in \nadvance. \nBranch Campuses \nClassrooms, seminar rooms, and laboratories are scheduled through the individual college \noffices.  At Raymond Walters College, OMI College of Applied Science, and Clermont College, \nclassrooms used for academic purposes are requested on a class order form or by memo through \nthe college office.  Classrooms for non-academic purposes are scheduled via memo or forms \nthrough the Business Office. \nProcedures: \nScheduling of teaching laboratories and special purpose rooms is accomplished through the \nindividual departments or colleges responsible for those facilities.  However, the usage of these \nrooms is reported to the Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling when \nthe class orders are submitted.  All requests for specific classrooms, seminar rooms and \nauditoria, must be directed to the Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and \nScheduling, on a class order form each quarter.  A class order may be placed at any point in the \nquarter and students have access to the course through the registration process on the same day \nthe class order is placed.  To have the class published in “Learning Opportunities,” the schedule \nof classes, a class order must be placed by a specific deadline date three (3) to six (6) months in \nadvance of the start of the quarter.  If no room is available, the class order will not be entered and \nthe college/department will be notified that the class order is being held until a room opens at the \nrequested time or the department will be offered alternate, open time slots. \nEach college and/or department is given preference in their own building or in adjacent buildings \nas space permits.  Classes are scheduled into classrooms based on estimated enrollment when the \nmix of rooms available allows a match of the room with the estimated enrollment.  Requests for \nthe use of specific classrooms on a preferred basis may be made, but there is no guarantee that \nthe specific room requested will be scheduled.  Although the scheduling office prefers to keep all \nclasses in the same room each quarter, the changing mix of course/selections each quarter \nincluding on quarter courses, and trailer courses, makes it impossible to keep all continuing \ncourses in the rooms that they occupied in the Autumn Quarter. \nExtra (all-quarter) one day meeting times called “extra rooms” for regularly scheduled academic \ncourses are scheduled only after all other academic scheduling has occurred.  One day meetings \nare currently not scheduled until the week before the quarter begins. \nOn the West Campus, large auditoria scheduling occurs once annually in January for the next \nacademic year.  Large auditoria request forms are delivered to all colleges and Arts and Sciences \ndepartments in December each year, and are due the first week of January.  Scheduling is  \n  10\n\nCCaasese: :1 1:1:122-c-vc-v0-000115555-T-MSBR BD oDco #c :# 6: 91 -F1il eFdil:e 0d6: /0122//2122/ 1P2a Pgea:g 4e6:  1o1f  1o4f 66 3 P  PAAGGEEIDID # :# 1: 43697\n \naccomplished before February 1 so that college/departments know their large auditoria schedule \nin order to plan their other course requests before Autumn class orders are due.  After the \nschedule for large auditoria is published, a course/section may not change the day or time.  \nRemaining space may be requested for use by any college/department and it is granted whenever \npossible.  The Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling has final authority \nto move course/sections if the need arises, especially if a larger course/section needs one of these \nlarge auditoria.  On the East Campus, large auditoria scheduling arrangements are made though \nthe college offices. \nOnce the scheduling process of course/sections is completed for a quarter (about 45 days before \nclasses begin), classroom assignments are sent to each college.  Once room assignments are \npublished and circulated, a college/department may request a room change.  Since room \nassignments are published on schedule/bills, room changes should not be made unless absolutely \nnecessary.  The students receive no notice that a room change has occurred prior to going to the \nfirst class meeting where a room change sign is posted directing them to the new room.  Room \nchange requests are accomplished through the department or college to keep them updated as to \nthe new location of the course.  Room change requests are honored if a room is available that \nwill accommodate the course/section enrollment.  Over subscription due to closed course \npetitioning should be avoided. \nClassroom Time Blocks \nAll undergraduate classes (excluding laboratories) are scheduled at regular times as defined \nbelow: \n•  Monday, Wednesday, Friday on the hour in 50 minute time blocks \n•  Tuesday and Thursday on the hour or half hour in 1 ½ hour time blocks \n \nGraduate courses may be scheduled in 2 to 3 hour time blocks, but they should begin and end on \nthe hour Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or on the hour or half hour on Tuesday and Thursday. \n \nFree Hours \nThe University has a Free Hour on Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.  For \nscheduling purposes, any course with a meeting time that crosses through that hour is considered \nas meeting during the Free Hour.  Permission to use the Free Hour for classroom scheduling is \ngiven with the proviso that only multiple section courses are scheduled during that time period.  \nThe proviso is made primarily so that those students and faculty involved in campus activities \nmay select another section if necessary.  Colleges and departments which find it necessary to \nschedule a single section course during the Free Hour must request an exception to the Free Hour \nPolicy.  Such requests should be in writing to the Director of Registration and Scheduling.  \nWritten notification is sent to the requesting department following review. \n  11\n\nCCaasese: :1 1:1:122-c-vc-v0-000115555-T-MSBR BD oDco #c :# 6: 91 -F1il eFdil:e 0d6: /0122//2122/ 1P2a Pgea:g 4e7:  1o2f  1o4f 66 3 P  PAAGGEEIDID # :# 1: 44608\n \nSection II - \nNON-ACADEMIC FACILITIES \n \nProcedures \nThe Campus Scheduling Office, 265 Tangeman University Center (556-2442) is responsible for \nscheduling all University facilities including exterior open space on West Campus when they are \nnot in use for academic purposes.

Individuals distributing printed material are responsible for cleaning up \ndebris (dropped flyers, etc.) in the area.  Non-University groups may not use the University \nname, seal, logo or other University identification in any advertising promotional literature, \nexcept to note location of the event. \nGroups may order tables and chairs through the Campus Scheduling Office with a minimum of 5 \nworking days notice.

These posting boards are located across campus in high traffic areas for high \nvisibility.     \nTemporary directional signs for special campus events and activities shall be located according \nto a pre-approved plan prepared and submitted by sponsoring college, department or university \norganization and posted on mobile boards or portable day-event boards as outlined in the \nuniversity’s Signage Policy and Standard. \n \nAllowable Sizes:  Temporary signs for posting on approved signboards and kiosks shall be a \nmaximum size of 20” x 30”.  Temporary directional signs shall be a maximum size of 30” x 40”. \nAllowable Materials:  Temporary signs shall be constructed of weather-resistant material.  \nWaterproof paints or inks must be used.  Wire frame supports shall not be allowed. \nAllowable Posting Time:  Temporary signs located on signboards and kiosks may be posted one \nweek prior to the event or program advertised in the sign and must be removed within five \ncalendar days following the event.   \nTemporary directional signs shall be put in place the first day of the relative event or program \nand removed no later than the day following the event or program. \nProcedure for Temporary Sign Approval:  No prior approval for freestanding or wall mounted \nposting board signs complying with the guidelines noted above will be required.  Temporary \ndirectional signs using mobile boards or portable day-event boards must be requested at lease \ntwo weeks in advance of the specific event along with a site location plan for the requested signs.  \nRequests should be submitted to the Campus Scheduling Office. \n \n \nTENT AND CANOPY USE ON CAMPUS \nGeneral: \nGroups desiring to erect a tent or canopy on campus for an event need to be aware that various \nfire and building code requirements apply to these structures.  In general, permits from the state \n  61\n\nCCaasese: :1 1:1:122-c-vc-v0-000115555-T-MSBR BD oDco #c :# 6: 91 -F1il eFdil:e 0d6: /0122//2122/ 1P2a Pgea:g 9e7:  6o2f  1o4f 66 3 P  PAAGGEEIDID # :# 1: 59108\nare NOT required for tents which are 200 square feet (10’ x 20’) or smaller.  A tent is a fabric \nstructure with more than two side walls. \nState permits are NOT required for canopies which are 400 square feet (20’ x 20’).  A canopy is \na fabric structure with up to two sides.  In the case of a canopy with no side walls, it may have a \nmaximum size of 700 square feet (20’ x 35’) without a permit being required.  If multiple \ncanopies are used, they must be at least 12 feet apart. \nIn all cases, a clearance of at least 12 feet must be maintained from buildings.  Also groups \nshould keep in mind that many grass areas on campus have buried utilities and sprinkler lines.  \nPlacement of poles or stakes into the ground must avoid these locations. \nWhile UC will endeavor to obtain the necessary permits, it is the ultimate responsibility of the \nevent organizer to have the permits prior to the day of the event.  Should the permits not be \nobtained, the event may not occur.   \n \nRequest to erect a tent or canopy: \nWhenever tens and canopies are going to be erected, notice must be given to Public Safety at \nleast ten business days in advance.  The Fire Prevention Unit will review the plan and assist the \nsponsoring group with any required state permits.  Whenever possible we will assist you in \ndesigning your event to avoid or minimize the required state permits and costs.  Send completed \ntent/canopy request forms to the Fire Prevention Unit at Mail Location 180.  If you have \nquestions or need assistance please call us at 556-4934. \n \nSignage and Safety Equipment: \nEach tent or canopy erected must have a fire extinguisher mounted in a visible location.  The \nextinguisher must be a 5 or 10 pound dry chemical, type ABC.  The company renting the tent \nshould be able to provide this extinguisher and a stand to mount it on. \nEach tent or canopy erected must have one or more no smoking signs posted so that they are \nvisible throughout the structure.  The no smoking signs must be at least 8” x 10” in size, with at \nleast 2” lettering. \n \nCooking Equipment and Open Flame: \nThe use of cooking equipment, grills, and any open flame is not permitted inside a tent or \ncanopy.  Please be aware that if you are planning on using this type of equipment outside the tent \nor canopy, a separate permit and inspection process is involved, although this is also coordinated \nthrough the Fire Prevention unit. \n \nSound and Lighting Equipment: \nThe use of public address systems inside a tent or canopy is permitted as long as they electrical \nsupply is protected by a Ground Fault Interrupter.  The use of any lighting equipment requires a \npermit and inspection from the state Industrial Compliance office (see Permit Fees below).  \nElectrical service must be requested from Facilities Management. \n \nPermit Fees: \nWhen the use of tents or canopies requires state permits, the State Fire Marshall and the State \nIndustrial Compliance office both charge user fees.  UC is not exempt from these fees, and the \ngroup sponsoring the event must pay the fees.  The State Fire Marshall’s office charges a fee of \n  62\n\nCCaasese: :1 1:1:122-c-vc-v0-000115555-T-MSBR BD oDco #c :# 6: 91 -F1il eFdil:e 0d6: /0122//2122/ 1P2a Pgea:g 9e8:  6o3f  1o4f 66 3 P  PAAGGEEIDID # :# 1: 59119\n$75.00 per event for inspecting tents, regardless of the number involved.  If your event uses one \ntent or twenty, the fee is always $75.00. \nThe industrial Compliance fee schedule is considerably more complicated.  The base fee is \n$228.25 for EACH tent or canopy.  If the tent/canopy is wired for electricity there is an \nadditional fee of $175.00 and if the tent/canopy has a mechanical system to provide ventilation \n(fans/Heat/air conditioning) there is another fee of $175.00.  So if you intend to use a single tent \nwith lights and fans, the Industrial Compliance fee for that tent is $578.25. \n \nInspections: \nIn all cases where a tent or canopy is being used on campus, an inspection is required.  Where a \npermit is required from the State Fire Marshall or from Industrial Compliance, those offices will \ninspect the installation.  Where no state permit is required then the University of Cincinnati’s \nFire Prevention unit will inspect the installation.  If this inspection can be completed during \nnormal business hours, there is no charge for the inspection.  If it must be done after hours, then \nthe sponsoring organization must pay the overtime costs. \n \n \n  63\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 99 of 146  PAGEID #:

In general, permits from the state are NOT required \nfor tents which are 200 square feet (10’ x 20’) or smaller. A tent is defined as a fabric structure with more than \ntwo side walls. \n•\t State permits are NOT required for canopies which are 400 square feet (20’ x 20’).   A canopy is a fabric \nstructure with up to two sides. In the case of a canopy with no side walls, it may have a maximum size of 700 \nsquare feet (20’ x 35’) without a permit being required. If multiple canopies are used, they must be at least 12’ \napart.\n•\t In all cases, a clearance of at least 12’ must be maintained from buildings. Also groups should keep in mind \nthat many grassy areas on campus have buried utilities, such as sprinkler lines. Placement of poles or stakes \ninto the ground must avoid these locations. A dig permit is required for any tents with stakes.\nRequest to Erect a Tent or Canopy\n•\t Whenever tents and canopies will be erected, notice must be given to Conference & Event Services at least \n15 business days in advance. The Fire Prevention Unit of Public Safety will review the plan and assist the \nsponsoring group with any required state permits. Whenever possible, they will assist you in designing your \nevent to avoid or minimize the required state permits and costs. You may contact the Fire Prevention Unit at \n513-556-4934.\nSignage and Safety Equipment\n•\t Each tent or canopy erected must have a fire extinguisher mounted in a visible location. The extinguisher \nmust be a five or ten pound dry chemical, type ABC. The company renting the tent should be able to provide \nthis extinguisher and a stand to mount it on. \n•\t Each tent or canopy erected must have one or more “No Smoking” signs posted so that they are visible \nthroughout the structure. The “No Smoking” signs must be at least 8” x 10” in size, with at least 2” lettering.\nCooking Equipment and Open Flame\n•\t The use of cooking equipment, grills, and any open flame is not permitted inside a tent or canopy. Please \nbe aware that if you are planning on using this type of equipment outside the tent or canopy, a separate \ngrill permit and inspection process is involved. Please call the Fire Prevention Unit at 513-556-4934 for more \ninformation.\nSound and Lighting Equipment\n•\t The use of public address systems inside a tent or canopy is permitted as long as the electrical supply is \nprotected by a Ground Fault Interrupter. The use of any lighting equipment requires a permit and inspection \nfrom the state Industrial Compliance office (see Permit Fees below). Electrical service must be requested \nfrom Facilities Management.\nPage 5\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 131 of 146  PAGEID #: 1552\nPermit Fees\n•\t When the use of tents or canopies requires a state permit, the State Fire Marshal and the State Industrial \nCompliance office both charge user fees. UC is NOT exempt from these fees, and the group sponsoring the \nevent must pay the fees. The State Fire Marshal’s office charges a fee of $75.00 per event for inspecting tents \nregardless of the number involved. If your event uses one tent or 20, the fee is always $75.00. \n•\t The Industrial Compliance fee schedule is considerably more complicated. The base  fee is $228.25 for EACH \ntent or canopy. If the tent or canopy is wired for electricity there is an additional fee of $175.00 and if the tent \nor canopy has a mechanical system to provide ventilation (fans/heat/air conditioning) there is another fee of \n$175.00. So if you intend to use a single tent with lights and fans, the Industrial Compliance fee for that tent \nis $578.25.\nInspections\n•\t In all cases when a tent or canopy is being used on campus, an inspection is required.   When a permit is \nrequired from the State Fire Marshal or from Industrial Compliance,  those offices will inspect installation. \nWhere no state permit is required then the  University of Cincinnati’s Fire Prevention unit will inspect the \ninstallation. If this inspection can be completed during normal business hours, there is no charge for the \ninspection. If the inspection must be done after hours, then the sponsoring organization of the event must \npay the overtime costs.\nElectric\n•\t If electric is needed, please contact Conference & Event Services. If a work order has not been placed in \nadvance, electric will not be supplied. \n•\t Groups are responsible to place their own work order at 513-556-6404 if electric is needed for the event. If a \nwork order has not been placed in advance electric will not be supplied.\nFire/Grills\n•\t If grills are being used, you must obtain a grill permit in advance. Contact Fire Safety at 513-556-4934. If a \ngrill permit is not obtained, you may be subject to a citation fee. \nAmplification\n•\t Groups are not permitted to amplify, unless a permit has been obtained from Conference & Event Services in \nadvance. If a permit is not obtained you may be subject to a citation. \nnote: Amplification is only permitted on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:30 p.m.–2:00 p.m. \nduring the academic term. Amplification is NOT permitted on McMicken Commons or \nBearcat Plaza during exam weeks, intercessions, or summer quarter.   Anything outside these \nlocations, times, or days will require a waiver. Requests are made through Conference & Event \nServices. \nDamage\n•\t If a vendor, group member, or participant in the event incites damages to university lawns or property, the \nsponsoring group will be charged for repairs.\nPage 6\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 132 of 146  PAGEID #: 1553\nfEaTURES of InDooR SPaCES\nGreat Hall\n•\t Lecture-style seating = 800-seat capacity    \n•\t Banquet-style seating = 432-seat capacity at round tables\n•\t Standing capacity = 1,100               \n•\t Outdoor reception area \n•\t Integrated AV capabilities              \n•\t Wireless service\nStudent Senate Room\n•\t 42-seat conference room              \n•\t Custom furniture                             \n•\t Wireless service \nGeneral Meeting Rooms\n•\t 19 rooms               \n•\t Seating from 10 to 250 \n•\t Integrated AV in eight rooms             \n•\t High-speed Internet access \n•\t Wireless service\nStudent Senate Room\nPage 7\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 133 of 146  PAGEID #: 1554\nMainStreet Cinema\n•\t 204-seat capacity                \n•\t Integrated AV capabilities\n•\t Hours during the Academic Year (September-June)\nBetween 8:00 a.m. and11:00 p.m., on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the Cinema is available for free \nprogramming.

Please \nbe aware that copyright infringers can be prosecuted. After reading this information, if you have questions about \ncopyright and licensing requirements,  MainStreet Operations will be happy to assist you. \nPlease contact us at 513-556-0943 or mainstreet@uc.edu.\nWHaT aRE PUblIC PERfoRManCES?\nSuppose you invite a few personal friends over for dinner and a movie. You purchase or rent a copy of a movie from \nthe local video store and view the film in your home that night. Have you violated the copyright law by illegally \n“publicly performing” the movie? Probably not. But suppose you took the same movie and showed it at a club or bar \nyou happen to manage. In this case, you have infringed the copyright of the movie. Simply put, movies obtained \nthrough a video store are not licensed for exhibition. Home video means just that: viewing of a movie at home by \nfamily or a close circle of friends.\nWHaT THE laW SaYS\nThe Federal Copyright Act (Title 17 of the United Stated Code) governs how copyrighted materials, such as movies, \nmay be used. Neither the rental nor the purchase of a DVD/videocassette carries with it the right to show the tape \noutside the home. In some instances, no license is required to view a movie, such as inside the home by family or \nsocial acquaintances and in certain narrowly defined face-to-face teaching activities.\nTaverns, restaurants, private clubs, prisons, lodges, factories, summer camps, public libraries, day-care facilities, parks and \nrecreation departments, churches, and non-classroom use at schools and universities, are all examples of situations \nwhere a public performance license must be obtained. This legal requirement applies regardless of whether an \nadmission fee is charged, whether the institution or organization is commercial or non-profit, or whether a federal or \nstate agency is involved.\nPEnalTIES foR CoPYRIGHT InfRInGEMEnT\n “Willful” infringement for commercial or financial gain is a federal crime punishable as a misdemeanor, carrying a \nmaximum sentence of up to one year in jail and/or a $100,000.00 fine. Even inadvertent infringers are subject to \nsubstantial civil damages, ranging from $500.00 to $20,000.00 for each illegal showing.\nHoW To obTaIn a PUblIC PERfoRManCE lICEnSE  \nObtaining a public performance license is relatively easy and usually requires no more than a phone call.\nFees are determined by such factors as the number of times a particular movie is going to be shown, how large \nthe audience will be, and so forth.  While fees vary, they are generally inexpensive for smaller performances.  Most \nlicensing fees are based on a particular performance or set of performances for specified films.\nPage 18\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 144 of 146  PAGEID #: 1565\nThe MainStreet Operations department can assist you in obtaining the proper licensing to show a public performance \nin our facility.  Prices for licenses vary depending on how recently the film was released.  Please inquire for more \ndetails.\nWHY IS HollYWooD ConCERnED aboUT SUCH PERfoRManCES?   \nThe concept of “public performance” is central to copyright and the issue of protection for “intellectual property.”  If \na movie producer, author, computer programmer or musician does not retain ownership of his or her “work,” there \nwould be little incentive for them to continue and little chance of recouping the enormous investment in research and \ndevelopment, much less profits for future endeavors.\nUnauthorized public performances in the U.S. are estimated to rob the movie industry of an estimated $2 million each \nyear.  Unfortunately, unauthorized public performances are just the tip of the iceberg.  The movie studios lose more \nthan $150 million annually due to pirated videotapes and several hundred million more dollars because of illegal \nsatellite and cable TV receptions.\nCoPYRIGHT InfRInGERS aRE PRoSECUTED\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its member companies are dedicated to stopping film and video \npiracy in all its forms, including unauthorized public performances.  The motion picture companies will go to court \nto ensure their copyrights are not violated.  Lawsuits, for example, have been filed against cruise ships and bus \ncompanies for unauthorized on-board exhibitions. If you are uncertain about your responsibilities under the copyright \nlaw, contact the MPAA, firms that handle public performance licenses, or the studios directly.  Avoid the possibility of \npunitive action.\nHaVE qUESTIonS oR nEED MoRE InfoRMaTIon? \nPlease contact MainStreet Operations at mainstreet@uc.edu or call 513-556-0943. \nIf you have questions about exhibition laws, you may also contact the Motion Picture Association of America at 1-800-\n662-6797. \nContent of this brochure reproduced with permission of the Motion Picture Association of America Copyright @ 1995 MPAA.\nWHo To ConTaCT aT MaInSTREET oPERaTIonS\n  Kim Schmidt, Interim Director, MainStreet Operations  513-556-0599 \n  Pat Bevis, Building Services Coordinator    513-556-5273\n  Bob Dean, Associate Director, MainStreet Operations    513-556-0414\n  Jennifer Moore, Executive Staff Assistant    513-556-0502\n  Crystal Stephens, Manager, Catskeller & Cinema    513-556-0943\n  Ellen Robinson-Wyatt, Program Director, Bearcat Card  513-556-1260\n  Janet Wolf, Manager, Mainstreet Connection Center    513-556-2831\n  MainStreet (Main Line), mainstreet@uc.edu    513-556-0502\nPage 19\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 145 of 146  PAGEID #: 1566\n \n \n \nK \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 146 of 146  PAGEID #: 1567\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69-1 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 1 of 1  PAGEID #: 1568\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 69-2 Filed: 06/12/12 Page: 1 of 1  PAGEID #: 1569\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby certify that on June 12, 2012, I electronically filed the foregoing with the Clerk \nof the Court using the CM/ECF system, which will send notification of such filing to the \nfollowing: \nBrian E.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nWESTERN DIVISION\nUNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI CHAPTER OF\nYOUNG AMERICANS FOR LIBERTY, et al.,  Case No. 1:12-cv-155\nPlaintiffs, Judge Timothy S. Black\nv.\nGREGORY WILLIAMS, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT BRITTANY SISKO’S \nMOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM (Doc. 77)\nThis civil case is before the Court on Defendant Brittany Sisko’s Motion to\nDismiss (Doc. 77) and the parties’ responsive memoranda (Docs. 84 & 85).  \nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\nPlaintiff Christopher Morbitzer is a student at the University of Cincinnati and the\npresident of the University of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty.  (Doc.\n69 at ¶¶ 5, 7).  On February 9, 2012, Morbitzer sent an email application to the\nUniversity’s Office of Campus Scheduling regarding his desire to gather signatures on\ncampus in support of a petition to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the\nNovember 2012 ballot.  (Doc. 69, Ex. F at 1).  Morbitzer sought clarification as to\nwhether he and YAL would need prior approval to gather signatures, speak with fellow\nstudents, and express their support for the initiative both inside the University’s\ndesignated Free Speech Area and on sidewalks and other open outdoor spaces.  (Id.). \n\nMorbitzer further sought clarification as to whether gathering signatures was a\n“demonstration, picket, or rally” within the meaning of the University’s Use of Facilities\nand Policy Manual.1  (Id.).  \nThe following day, Morbitzer received a response from “Conference and Event\nServices” and authored by University employee Brian Short.  (Doc. 69, Ex. G).  The\nemail did not directly answer Morbitzer’s question about whether the gathering of\nsignatures was a “demonstration, picket, or rally” and instructed him to use the online\nform to request the use of the McMicken Commons Northwest Corner (the Free Speech\nArea).  The email further stated that “Per Use of Facilities, you are not permitted to walk\naround campus, if we are informed that you are, Public Safety will be contacted.”  (Id.). \nThe email explained that Morbitzer would receive an email confirmation in “about 3\nbusiness days, sometimes less” regarding whether or not his request had been approved. \n(Id.).  \nMorbitzer then completed the requisite form.  (Doc. 69, Ex. H).  The same day, he\nreceived an email from Campus Scheduling student employee Brittany Sikso, granting\nhim permission to use only the Free Speech Zone: “You have been assigned the \nNorthwest Corner of McMicken Commons, however you are not permitted to walk\naround.  Also note, that your event was approved despite our 5 Day Business Policy.  In\nthe future this will not be allowed.”  (Id., Ex. I).\n1 The University’s Use of Facilities Policy manual in effect at the time restricted\n“demonstrations, picketing, and rallies” to the northwest corner of McMicken Commons,\ndesignated as the University “Free Speech Area.” (Doc. 69, Ex. A at 15).  \n-2-\n\nB. Procedural History \nPlaintiffs filed the instant action on February 22, 2012, alleging that the\nUniversity’s policies regulating student speech violated the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs\nsought injunctive relief against a number of University officials, including Defendant\nSisko.  Plaintiffs later filed a First Amended Complaint, which added a claim against\nDefendant Sisko in her individual capacity for violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  (See Doc.\n15). \nOn June 12, 2012, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary\nInjunction, finding that the Free Speech Area and the open outdoor areas of campus were\ndesignated public fora and that the University’s policies failed to satisfy the requirements\nof strict scrutiny.  (See Doc. 65).  The Court enjoined the Defendants from enforcing its\nunconstitutional policies, and ordered them to craft more narrowly tailored regulations.\n(Id.).  The University has since adopted revised policies. (See Doc. 81 at 1-2) \nDefendant Sisko responded to Plaintiffs’ allegations by filing a Motion to Dismiss\n(Doc. 37).  However, the Court subsequently granted Plaintiffs leave to amend the\ncomplaint, rendering the pending motion moot.  (See Doc. 67).  Plaintiffs have since filed\nthe Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 69), and Defendant Sisko has filed a new Motion\nto Dismiss (Doc. 77), again arguing that the complaint fails to state a claim and that she is\nimmune from suit on the grounds of qualified immunity. The parties have filed responsive\nmemoranda (Docs. 84 and 85), and the matter is now ripe for review. \n-3-\n\nII. ANALYSIS\nSisko argues that Plaintiffs’ claim that she is liable in her individual capacity fails\nfor two reasons: (1) the Second Amended Complaint has failed to state a claim against\nher; and (2) she is entitled to qualified immunity for her actions.  \nA. Failure to State a Claim\nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim operates to test the sufficiency of\nthe complaint.  Rule 12(b)(6) permits dismissal of a complaint for “failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P 12(b)(6).  The complaint must contain\na “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).  The plaintiff's ground for relief must entail more than “labels and\nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” \nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).\nThe first step in testing the sufficiency of the complaint is to identify any\nconclusory allegations.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals\nof the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not\nsuffice.”  Id. (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  That is, “a\nplaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of [his] entitlement to relief requires more\nthan labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of\naction will not do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Although the court must accept\nwell-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint as true for purposes of a motion to\n-4-\n\ndismiss, the court is “not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual\nallegation.”  Id.\nAfter assuming the veracity of all well-pleaded factual allegations, the second step\nis for the court to determine whether the complaint pleads “a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 570).  A\nclaim is facially plausible when the plaintiff “pleads factual content that allows the court\nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” \nId. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). \nPlaintiffs have failed to state a plausible claim for relief against Defendant Sisko in\nher individual capacity.  To bring an individual capacity claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nPlaintiffs must demonstrate:  (1) the defendant was a person acting under the color of\nstate law and (2) the defendant deprived the plaintiff of rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Fridley v. Horrighs, 291 F.3d\n867, 871-72 (6th Cir. 2002).  Here, the facts alleged by Plaintiffs are insufficient to\ndemonstrate that Sisko deprived them of their First Amendment rights. \nPlaintiffs’ only factual allegations are that Sisko sent an email granting their use of\nthe Free Speech Area, waiving the notice requirement, and informing them of the\nUniversity policy prohibiting the circulation of petitions on sidewalks.  (Doc. 69 at ¶ 91). \nPlaintiffs make no allegations that Sisko was a decision-maker with respect to the\ncreation of the University policy, that she had the authority to grant them the use of the\n-5-\n\nsidewalks, nor that she made any decisions on the basis of the nature of their speech. \nSisko simply granted the request and repeated a University policy.  Plaintiffs simply offer\nconclusory allegations that “As a direct and proximate result of the denial by Brittany\nSisko of their request . . . Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs\nhave suffered injury and damages.”  (Id. at ¶ 103).   Such threadbare allegations are\ninsufficient to state a claim for relief.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663. \nB. Qualified Immunity\nSisko also seeks to dismiss the claims against her in her individual capacity on the\ngrounds of qualified immunity. Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state\na claim against Defendant Sisko, resolution of the qualified immunity question is\nunnecessary.  \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated herein, Defendant Brittany Sisko’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc.\n77) is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Sisko in her individual capacity\nare DISMISSED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDate:  8/22/12       s/ Timothy S. Black        \nTimothy S. Black\nUnited States District Judge\n-6-",

WILLIAMS (“Mr. \nWilliams”), CORINN SHEMAK (“Ms.  Shemak”), CATHY KRUMPELBECK (“Ms. \nKrumpelbeck”), MICHAEL CURETON (“Mr. Cureton”), and JOHN DOE (collectively, \nthe “Defendants”), allege as follows: \n \nINTRODUCTION \n   \n1.  This is an action for declaratory judgment, temporary restraining order, \npreliminary and permanent injunction, and nominal damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983 \narising  from  the  unconstitutional  policies  and  practices  of  Defendants.    Due  to \nDefendants’ policies, practices and custom, as well as certain conduct by one or more \nDefendant, Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm to their \nrights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  The harm may only be remedied by a \nruling from this Court.   \n2.  By maintaining, implementing and enforcing vague policies that, among \nother things, (i) restrict and prohibit students from engaging in expressive activity on the \nvast  majority  of  the  University  of  Cincinnati  campus,  (ii)  restrict  and  prohibit \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 3 of 28  PAGEID #: 3\nspontaneous student speech  in  response to  recent  or still-unfolding events, (iii) vest \nunfettered  discretion  in  university  administrators  to  restrict  student  speech,  and  (iv) \nthreaten students with disciplinary or criminal charges for violation of such policies, \nDefendants have impeded and will continue to unconstitutionally impede Plaintiffs in \ntheir efforts to collect signatures for petitions for a state ballot initiative and advocate for \nits passage. Such expressive activity is a core concern of the First Amendment.  \n3.  Additionally, Plaintiffs desire to engage in other activities consistent with \nthe  purpose  and  goals  of  the  organization  and,  in  so  doing,  to  engage  in  activities \nprotected by the First Amendment in and about the University of Cincinnati campus \nwithout being subjected to the threat of enforcement or the actual enforcement of a \npolicy, practice or custom that fails to comply with the requirements of the United States \nConstitution. \n4.  As a result of the policy, practice and custom of the Defendants, as well as  \ncertain conduct by one or more Defendant, Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to \nsuffer irreparable harm unless the Defendants are immediately enjoined from restricting \nthe Plaintiffs’ (and others’) protected speech in this manner.  \n \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff University of Cincinnati Chapter of Young Americans for Liberty \n(“UC YAL”) is the local chapter of the national group Young Americans for Liberty, and \nis an unincorporated association of students at the University of Cincinnati.  UC YAL is \nan officially recognized student organization at the University of Cincinnati.  It consists \nsolely of students at the University of Cincinnati and a faculty advisor.  UC YAL seeks to \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 4 of 28  PAGEID #: 4\nrecruit, train, educate, and mobilize students on the ideals of liberty and the United States \nConstitution.    UC  YAL  brings  this  action  on  behalf  of  itself  and  its  members  and \nsupporters. \n6.  One of the activities in which UC YAL is involved includes efforts to \nadvocate and advance the initiative petition process by gathering signatures to place \nfreedom-oriented ballot initiatives before Ohio voters.  At the present time and in support \nof this effort, UC YAL seeks to gather signatures on the University campus for the Ohio \nWorkplace Freedom Amendment, for which the deadline to submit signatures is July 9, \n2012, if it is to appear on the November 2012 ballot, or approximately the same date in \n2013 if it is to appear on the November 2013 ballot.  UC YAL anticipates working on \nsimilar ballot initiatives in the future, including those related to tax limitations and school \nchoice. \n7.  Plaintiff Christopher Morbitzer is a student at the University of Cincinnati \nand President of UC YAL.   \n8.  Defendant  University  of  Cincinnati  is  a  public  university  located  in \nCincinnati, Ohio.  It is part of the university system of Ohio and is a “state university” \norganized pursuant to Section 3361.01 et seq. of the Ohio Revised Code.  \n9.  Defendant Gregory H. Williams is, and has been at all times relevant to \nthe facts at issue in this case, the President of the University of Cincinnati.  As President \nof the University of Cincinnati, Mr. Williams is the university’s chief administrative and \nexecutive officer. \n10.  Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 3361:10-5-01(J), as President of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati, Mr. Williams “shall have the authority to adopt necessary and \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 5 of 28  PAGEID #: 5\nreasonable policies and procedures regarding the use of the facilities of the university, \nwhich amplify the university rules, and Ohio and federal law. [He] shall also have the \nauthority to amend or rescind such policies and procedures.” \n11.  Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 3361:10-5-01(O), as President of \nthe  University  of  Cincinnati,  Mr.  Williams  “shall  have  the  authority  to:  (1)  Adopt \namendments to any university rule which: (a) Would clarify or correct the language of the \nrule but would not constitute a substantive change; or  (b) Would conform the rule to \napplicable laws or regulations.” \n12.  Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 3361:10-1-09(B)(2)(a), as President \nof the University of Cincinnati, Mr. Williams “may amend any rule of the university . . . \nwhich . . . would conform the rule to applicable laws or regulations.” \n13.  Defendant Corinn Shemak is, and has been at all times relevant to the facts \nat  issue  in  this  case,  the  Program  Director  of  Conference  &  Event  Services  at  the \nUniversity of Cincinnati.  Based upon information and belief, Defendant Corinn Shemak, \nas  part  of  her  official  duties  and  responsibilities  with  the University of Cincinnati, \nimplements  or  enforces  the  unconstitutional  restrictions  accomplished  through  the \nUniversity’s policies and practices (as described herein). \n14.  Defendant Cathy Krumpelbeck is, and has been at all times relevant to the \nfacts at issue in this case, the Public Safety Special Events Coordinator at the University \nof Cincinnati.  Based upon information and belief, Defendant Cathy Krumpelbeck, as \npart  of  her  official  duties  and  responsibilities  with  the University of Cincinnati, \nimplements  or  enforces  the  unconstitutional  restrictions  accomplished  through  the \nUniversity’s policies and practices (as described herein). \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 6 of 28  PAGEID #: 6\n15.  Defendant Michael Cureton is, and has been at all times relevant to the \nfacts at issue in this case, the Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police at the \nUniversity of Cincinnati Department of Public Safety.  Based upon information and \nbelief, Defendant Michael Cureton, as part of his official duties and responsibilities with \nthe University of Cincinnati,  implements  or  enforces  the  unconstitutional  restrictions \naccomplished through the University’s policies and practices (as described herein). \n16.  Defendant John Doe is a University of Cincinnati official or employee \nwho had the authority to – and in fact did – deny Plaintiffs’ attempted to engage in \nexpressive activities delineated in this Complaint.  Defendant John Doe’s identity is \nunknown at this time, and he or she is named in his/her official and individual capacity.  \nBased upon information and belief, one of the named Defendants may be Defendant John \nDoe. \n17.  All actions by the Defendants described herein were undertaken under \ncolor of state law which caused the deprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights protected by the \nUnited States Constitution. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, as this action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), in that it is brought to redress \ndeprivations, under color of state law, of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the \nUnited States Constitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), in that it seeks to recover \ndamages and secure equitable relief under an Act of Congress, specifically, 42 U.S.C. § \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 7 of 28  PAGEID #: 7\n1983, which provides a cause of action for the protection of civil and constitutional \nrights; under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), to secure declaratory relief; under 28 U.S.C. § 2202, to \nsecure preliminary and injunctive relief and damages; and under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, to \naward attorneys fees. \n19.  Venue is proper within this judicial district and division pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b) and Local Rule 82.1, as (i) the Defendants are situated within this \njudicial district and division; and (ii) all of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs arose within \nthis judicial district and division. \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe University’s Policy \n20.  The University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of over 41,000 students, \nincluding 3,861 on-campus residents.  It has an annual budget of $1.05 billion. \n21.  In Ohio Administrative Code 3361:10-17-01, the board of trustees of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati declared that: \n(A)    The  university  of  Cincinnati,  a  public  institution  dedicated  to \nproviding an environment conductive to teaching, learning, research, and a \ncontinuing search for truth, will not take a position on any matter of \npolitical or public controversy.  \n \n(B)  Any  individual  member  or  group  of  members  of  the  university \ncommunity, like any other citizen or group of citizens, is free to debate \nand take a position on any matter of public controversy. But, since the \ncollective  reputation  of  the  university  cannot  be  abrogated  by  an \nindividual or group as a means of supporting his/her or its position, any \nsuch activity must be taken in a way to make clear that it is not being \ncarried on by or in the name of the university.  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 8 of 28  PAGEID #: 8\n22.  Thus, pursuant to the declaration of the board of trustees of the University \nof Cincinnati, the campus of the University of Cincinnati is dedicated to “providing an \nenvironment  conductive  to  teaching,  learning,  research,  and  a  continuing  search  for \ntruth.” \n23.  However,  despite  making  the  lofty  declaration  that  “[a]ny  individual \nmember or group of members of the university community, like any other citizen or \ngroup  of  citizens,  is  free  to  debate  and  take  a  position  on  any  matter  of  public \ncontroversy,” the University of Cincinnati, through the actions of the Defendants, has \nadopted and regularly enforces a policy, practice and custom that does not provide or \nallow the university campus to be used as an  “environment conductive to teaching, \nlearning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \n24.  Despite making the declaration that “[a]ny individual member or group of \nmembers of the university community, like any other citizen or group of citizens, is free to \ndebate and take a position on any matter of public controversy,” the University of Cincinnati, \nthrough the actions of the Defendants, has adopted and regularly enforces a policy, practice \nand custom that severely restricts and burdens the free speech rights of individual students or \ngroups of students, including the free speech rights of the Plaintiffs. \n25.  The University of Cincinnati has a published policy for scheduling use of \ncampus facilities and spaces  for  expressive activities.  The Use of  Facilities Policy \nManual (the “Policy Manual”) is available at http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common \n/docs/policies/UseFacilitiesManual.pdf.  A true and accurate copy of the Policy Manual is \nattached as Exhibit A. \n26.  The Policy Manual states that:  \n \nDemonstrations, Picketing and Rallies \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 9 of 28  PAGEID #: 9\nGroups  planning  a  demonstration  picket  or  rally  should  contact  the \nCampus  Scheduling  Office  or  the  appropriate  scheduling  office  to \nfamiliarize  themselves  with  University  policies  governing  the  activity. \nDemonstrations, picketing or rallies must be scheduled in the appropriate \nscheduling office and may only take place on the northwest corner of \nMcMicken Commons. Anyone requesting to demonstrate, picket or rally \nmust give prior notice of ten (10) working days to the University Police. \nSuch activities are not permitted inside any campus building. Bonfires \nrequire additional clearance from the scheduling office, the Department of \nFacilities  Management,  the  Department  of  Public  Safety,  and  the \nCincinnati Fire Department. \n \n(see Exhibit A, Policy Manual, at 15).  The Uptown West Campus Map shows this area \nof McMicken Commons.  It is indicated by the green shaded area (see Exhibit B, Uptown \nWest Campus Map, modified with color).   \n27.  The terms “demonstration,” “picket,” and “rally” are not defined in the \nPolicy  Manual,  and  no  examples  are  given  of  what  activities  any  of  these  terms \nencompass or exclude. \n28.  Thus,  the  failure  of  the  Policy  Manual  to  clearly  define  the  terms \n“demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally” means that a person of ordinary intelligence is not \nafforded the ability to readily identify the applicable standard for inclusion and exclusion \nwithin the requirements of the foregoing policy. \n29.  Furthermore, the failure of the Policy Manual to provide clear standards to \nguide the discretion of the public officials of the Univeristy of Cincinnati as to what \nactivities are included within the terms “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally” results in \nenabling  such  public  officials  to  administer  the  foregoing  policy  on  the  basis  of \nimpermissible factors or through arbitrary application. \n30.  Because the foregoing policy functions as a licensing scheme with which \nstudents  must  comply  prior  to  engaging  in  the  exercise  of  their  free  speech  rights \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 10 of 28  PAGEID #: 10\n(notwithstanding  that  the  University  of  Cincinnati,  by  the  board  of  trustees’  own \ndeclaration, is dedicated “to providing an environment conductive to teaching, learning, \nresearch, and a continuing search for truth”), the foregoing policy constitutes a prior restraint \non speech, resulting in censorship. \n31.  Because the foregoing policy requires ten working days’ advance notice \nbefore any planned “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally,” a student request for use of the \n“Free Speech Area,” i.e., the northwest corner of McMicken Commons, must be at least \nfourteen calendar days in advance due to intervening weekends not being counted toward \nthe requirement (and even longer if holidays are within the notification period).  \n32.  Because the foregoing policy requires ten working days’ advance notice \nbefore any planned “demonstration,” “picket,” or “rally,” the policy unconstitutionally \nprevents spontaneous student expressive activity in response to recent or still-unfolding \nevents, as well as events of a time-sensitive or continuous and ongoing nature. \n33.  On December 8, 2008, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education \n(“FIRE”),  a  non-partisan,  non-profit  501(c)(3)  educational  foundation  dedicated  to \ndefending and sustaining freedom of speech at our nation’s colleges and universities,  \nwrote a letter to the then-president of the University of Cincinnati expressing its concern \nabout the Free Speech Area, the notice requirement, and the threat made in the Policy \nManual that “anyone violating this policy may be charged with trespassing” (attached as \nExhibit C).  FIRE argued that the University’s restrictions were unconstitutionally vague \nand unreasonably restricted student speech in violation of the First Amendment. \n34.  On  December  22,  2008,  the  general  counsel  of  the  University  of \nCincinnati responded to FIRE’s comments with a letter defending the Free Speech Area \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 11 of 28  PAGEID #: 11\n(attached as Exhibit D), asserting that the foregoing policy of the University of Cincinnati \nmeets constitutional standards. \n \nThe Fora at Issue \n35.  The  “northwest  corner  of  McMicken  Commons”  referenced  in  the \nforegoing  policy  of  the  University  of  Cincinnati  on  “Demonstrations,  Picketing  and \nRallies” is demarcated in the Policy Manual and referred to as the “Free Speech Area”:  \nFree Speech Area \nThe northwest section (see diagram) of McMicken Commons immediately \neast of McMicken Hall on the West Campus is designated as the main free \nspeech  area.  Individuals  or  groups  wanting  to  use  these  areas  must \nschedule the activity in the Campus Scheduling Office. Anyone violating \nthis policy may be charged with trespassing. No more than one musical or \nspeaking activity is permitted at the same time. \n \n(see Exhibit A, Policy Manual, at 14).  The Free Speech Area is the area immediately east \nof McMicken Hall.  It is indicated by the green shaded area on Exhibit B, the Uptown \nWest Campus Map).  Exhibit E is a photograph of McMicken Commons modified to \nshow the Free Speech Area colored red. \n36.  At its longest points, Plaintiffs estimate that the Free Speech Area is 82 \nfeet east-west and 124 feet north-south. The Free Speech Area is approximately 10,000 \nsquare  feet.    The  West  Campus  of  the  University  is  137  acres,  or  approximately \n8,506,833 square feet.  The Free Speech Area is therefore approximately 0.1% of the total \narea of West Campus. \n37.  The  West  Campus  area  has  many  suitable  open  areas  and  sidewalks \nbeyond  the  Free  Speech  Area  where  student  expressive  activity,  including  petition \ngathering  and  political  discussion,  will  not  interfere  with  or  disturb  access  to  UC \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 12 of 28  PAGEID #: 12\nbuildings or sidewalks, impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or in any way substantially \ndisrupt the operations of campus or the University’s educational functions.  \n \nThe Expressive Conduct at Issue \n38.  On February 9, 2012, the Ohio Ballot Board approved language for a \nballot measure proposing an amendment to the Ohio Constitution titled “To guarantee the \nfreedom  of  Ohioans  to  choose  whether  to  participate  in  a  labor  organization  as  a \ncondition of employment” (“the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment”).   \n39.  The approval by the Ohio Ballot Board thus cleared the way for signatures \nto be gathered to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the ballot to be \nvoted on by the voters of Ohio. \n40.  On Monday, February 13, 2012, backers of the Ohio Workplace Freedom \nAmendment finalized the petition and made it available for download and circulation. \n41.  Plaintiffs desire to gather signatures to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom \nAmendment  on  the  ballot,  and  in  the  process,  to  discuss  the  initiative  with  their \nclassmates on campus and to advocate for the passage of the initiative itself.  Doing so \nwould be consistent with the University of Cincinnati’s designation of its campus as an \n“environment conductive to teaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for \ntruth.” \n42.  To qualify for placement on the November 2012 ballot, supporters of the \nOhio Workplace Freedom Amendment need to obtain over 385,000 valid signatures on \npetitions no later than July 9, 2012 (120 days prior to the November 2012 elections).  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 13 of 28  PAGEID #: 13\nAccordingly, at this time, there are less than five months left to gather these signatures \nfrom registered Ohio voters.   \n43.  Due to invalid signatures that inevitably occur during an initiative petition \neffort  (due  to  various  reasons),  significantly  more  than  385,000  signatures  will  be \nnecessary in order to meet the requisite number of valid signatures.  By way of example, \nthe recently successful Ohio Health Care Freedom Amendment that passed in November \n2011  was  also  put  on  the  ballot  via  initiative  petition;  supporters  of  that  initiative \nsubmitted 546,074 signatures to the Ohio Secretary of State of which only 426,998 \nsignatures were verified as valid. \n44.  Given the deadline for the petition, on each occasion when Plaintiffs are \nunlawfully and unconstitutionally prevented from collecting signatures and advocating \nfor the passage of the initiative, not only does a violation of their constitutional rights \ntake place, but the likelihood that the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment will be on \nthe November 2012 ballot is reduced. \n45.  The notice requirement of ten working days means that each scheduled \ninstance of gathering to collect signatures on the Free Speech Area faces a potential delay \nof up to fourteen calendar days (or more if there are intervening holidays during the \nnotification period). \n46.  Furthermore,  the  notice  requirement  prohibits  spontaneous  speech  in \nresponse to the actions of the Ballot Board, which substantially burdens the Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment rights and leads to a delay in petition gathering and advocacy for the \nissue. The requirement continues to prohibit spontaneous speech, preventing UC YAL \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 14 of 28  PAGEID #: 14\nfrom gathering signatures when a conversation evokes the interest of a fellow student \nwho may wish to sign a petition. \n47.  Limiting petition gathering and advocacy by preventing students  from \nusing the overwhelming majority of campus grounds for expressive activity substantially \nburdens the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and significantly restricts the number of \nsignatures that may be gathered to place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on \nthe November 2012 ballot. \n48.  In reaction to the news of the Ballot Board’s approval to begin collecting \nsignatures, Mr. Morbitzer immediately sent an email on February 9, 2012, to the relevant \nauthorities  at  the  University  of  Cincinnati  (via  the  email  address \n“campusscheduling@uc.edu”) requesting permission to collect signatures and asking for \nclarification  of  the  University’s  policies  classifying  expressive  activity  as  a \n“demonstration, picket, or rally” and therefore limited to the Free Speech Area (attached \nas Exhibit F). \n49.  At 8:05 a.m. on the next day, February 10, 2012, Mr. Morbitzer received \nan unsigned email response from “Conference & Event Services” via the email address \n“campusscheduling@uc.edu.” The response failed  to  expressly  clarify  the University \npolicy regarding the definitions of a “demonstration, picket, or rally”; told Mr. Morbitzer \nto “use the online form to request use of McMicken Commons Northwest Corner”; and \nthreatened police action if the Plaintiffs were seen merely “walk[ing] around campus” \nengaging in expressive activity outside of the Free Speech Area (attached as Exhibit G). \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 15 of 28  PAGEID #: 15\n50.  The response from “Conference & Event Services” to Mr. Morbitzer on \nFebruary 10, 2012, was sent by Defendant John Doe who, as noted above, is believed to \nbe one of the named Defendants. \n51.  The response from “Conference & Event Services”  to Mr. Morbitzer on \nFebruary  10,  2012,  implied  that  Plaintiffs’  desired  expressive  activity,  i.e.,  petition \ncirculating, was within the scope of the term “demonstration, picket, or rally.” \n52.  In response, Mr. Morbitzer requested permission via the online form on \nFebruary 10, 2012.  However, the form failed to provide Mr. Morbitzer and UC YAL \nwith the option of requesting permission to engage in their desired expressive activity on \ncampus immediately.   \n53.  Contrary to the University’s Policy Manual, which requires “prior notice \nof  ten  (10)  working  days”  before  engaging  in  expressive  activity  deemed  a \n“demonstration, picket, or rally” in the Free Speech Area, the online form stated that  \n“[o]utdoor spaces must be requested at least 15 days in advance of the event” (attached as \nExhibit H).  No explanation of this discrepancy is given in the Policy Manual.   \n54.  In an email response from “Conference & Event Services” on Friday, \nFebruary 10 (a copy of which is attached as Exhibit I), Mr. Morbitzer’s request was \napproved only to the extent Plaintiffs remained at all times in the Free Speech Area: \nHello Christopher, \n \nPlease see your event confirmation below. You have been assigned the North-\nWest corner of McMicken Commons, however you are not permitted to walk \naround. \n \nAlso note, that your event was approved despite our 5 Day Business Policy. In \nthe future, this will not be allowed. Therefore, make sure you put your event \nrequest in 5 Business Days before your desired date. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 16 of 28  PAGEID #: 16\nReview the Event Guide and Policies link below for important policies and \nprocesses involved with your scheduled space.  \nhttp://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/eventservices/docs/Confirmation%20Notice\n.Policy%20and%20Process.pdf \n \nIf you have any questions please contact Conference & Event Services at 556-\n2442. \n \nThank you, \nConference & Event Services \n \n55.  The approval restricted Plaintiffs’ expressive activity to the Free Speech \nArea (“the North-West corner of McMicken Commons”) and once again noted Plaintiffs \n“are not permitted to walk around.”  This response indicated that Defendants construed \nthe terms “demonstration, picket, or rally” to include expressive activity like the signature \ngathering, advocacy, and discussion in which Plaintiffs sought to engage. \n56.  Based on information and belief, the e-mail from “Conference & Event \nServices” was sent by Defendant John Doe, who, as noted above, is believed to be one of \nthe named Defendants. \n57.  This email response refers to a notification period of five business days, \nwhile the Use of Facilities Policy Manual refers to ten working days, and the online form \nrefers to fifteen days.  No explanation of this discrepancy is given in the Policy Manual.   \n58.  The requirement of five, ten, or fifteen days notice unreasonably prevents \nspontaneous expressive activities in response to recent or still-unfolding events, as well \nas those of a time-sensitive nature. For example, it would have been impossible for \nUniversity  students  to  gather  spontaneously  to  demonstrate  their  shock  and  sadness \nfollowing the tragic events of September 11, 2011, or their support of the United States’ \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 17 of 28  PAGEID #: 17\nsuccessful military operation in killing Osama Bin Laden, without violating University \npolicy.  \n59.  Furthermore, the lack of clarity with regard to which of the three notice \nperiods  is  applicable  breeds  confusion  and  uncertainty  amongst  would-be  student \nspeakers, resulting in an impermissible chilling effect on campus and the arbitrary and \ncapricious enforcement of the policy. \n60.  Plaintiffs  desire  to  engage  in  expressive  activities  beyond  gathering \nsignatures on behalf of the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment.  In addition to seeking \nto gather signatures for this initiative until July of 2012, and possibly July 2013, Plaintiffs \nhave concrete plans to work on future signature-gathering campaigns. \n61.  On Wednesday, February 15, Plaintiffs – consisting of three members of \nUC YAL – engaged in signature gathering, advocacy, and discussion in the Free Speech \nArea as limited by Defendants.  Plaintiffs managed to gather only one signature and were \nonly able to interact with six students as a result of the low pedestrian traffic in and \nadjacent to the Free Speech Area.  Plaintiffs witnessed that the overwhelming majority of \npedestrian traffic on McMicken Commons going to and coming from the surrounding \nbuildings occurred on sidewalks not adjacent to the Free Speech Area, and thus these \nstudents were inaccessible to UC YAL signature gatherers limited to the confines of the \nFree Speech Area. \n62.  As a direct and proximate result of the denial by John Doe of their request \nto  immediately  gather  signatures,  to  advocate  for  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom \nAmendment, and to discuss the initiative’s merits with their fellow students, Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered injury and damages. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 18 of 28  PAGEID #: 18\n63.  The actions of John Doe in denying Plaintiffs’ request to immediately \ngather signatures, to advocate for the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment, and to \ndiscuss the initiative’s merits with their fellow students was the direct and proximate \nresult of the policy, practice and custom of the University of Cincinnati as adopted and \nimplemented by Defendants. \n64.  As a direct and proximate result of John Doe restricting and confining the \nPlaintiffs only within the Free Speech Area in order to engage in the initiative petition \neffort, Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered \ninjury and damages. \n65.  The actions of John Doe in restricting and confining the Plaintiffs only \nwithin the Free Speech Area in order to engage in the initiative petition effort was the \ndirect  and  proximate  result  of  the  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  the  University  of \nCincinnati as adopted and implemented by one or more of the Defendants. \n66.  As a direct and proximate result of the policy, practice and custom of the \nUniversity of Cincinnati as adopted and implemented by one or more of the Defendants, \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights have been violated and Plaintiffs have suffered injury and \ndamages. \n \nDefendants’ Inconsistent Application of the Policy at Issue \n67.  As  mentioned  above,  Defendants  inconsistently  apply  the  notification \nperiod  for  expressive  activities,  seemingly  confused  about  whether  the  required \nnotification period is five, ten, or fifteen days. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 19 of 28  PAGEID #: 19\n68.  Defendants have also been inconsistent in how they define an expressive \nactivity as a “demonstration, picket or rally” that is therefore limited to the Free Speech \nArea only. \n69.  For example, in October 2011 and the autumn of 2008, Mr. Morbitzer \nwitnessed  individuals  engaged  in  voter  registration  throughout  the  grounds  of  West \nCampus.  They were not limited to the Free Speech Area. \n70.  Similarly,  in  the  spring  of  2009,  Mr.  Morbitzer  witnessed  individuals \ngathering signatures throughout the grounds of West Campus for a proposed amendment \nto the Ohio Constitution to legalize casino gambling.  They were not limited to the Free \nSpeech Area. \n71.  On  information  and  belief,  these  signature  gathering,  advocacy,  and \ndiscussion activities were not classified as a “demonstration, picket, or rally,” while \nPlaintiffs’ identical activity was so classified and was therefore restricted to the Free \nSpeech Area. \n72.  Based  upon  information  and  belief,  officials  within  the  University  of \nCincinnati were aware of such First Amendment activities freely taking place outside the \nFree Speech Area, yet no action was taken to confine such activities within the Free \nSpeech Area. \n73.  In fact, based upon information and belief, officials within the University \nof Cincinnati actively supported or condoned such First Amendment activities freely \ntaking place outside the Free Speech Area. \n74.  To  the  extent  officials  within  the  University  of  Cincinnati  actively \nsupported or condoned such First Amendment activities freely taking place outside the \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 20 of 28  PAGEID #: 20\nFree Speech Area, the restriction of the Plaintiffs to the Free Speech Area for their \ninitiative  petition  effort  constituted  unconstitutional  discrimination  based  upon  the \ncontent or viewpoint of the speaker. \n \nSTATEMENT OF LAW \n75.  Defendant  University  of  Cincinnati  is  a  state  actor.    See  Thomson  v. \nHarmony, 65  F.3d  1314,  1319  (6th  Cir.  1995)  (“The University  of  Cincinnati is \na state instrumentality”); Hall v. Medical College of Ohio, 742 F.2d 299, 303–04 (6th Cir. \n1984) (discussing how state universities in Ohio, including University of Cincinnati, are \nconsidered “arms of the state”). \n76.  At all times relevant to the allegations in this Complaint, each and all of \nthe acts alleged herein were attributed to one or more of the Defendants acting under the \ncolor, authority, and pretense of state law, statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs, \nusages, and policies of the University of Cincinnati. \n77.  Soliciting and gathering signatures on a petition is core political speech \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Meyer v. Grant, \n486 U.S. 414, 422 n.5, 425 (1988). \n78.  The  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  extend  to  campuses  of  state \nuniversities.  Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972). \n79.  Due process requires that a state enactment be held void for vagueness if \nthe prohibitive terms are not clearly defined such that a person of ordinary intelligence \ncan readily identify the applicable standard for inclusion and exclusion.  Grayned v. City \nof Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 21 of 28  PAGEID #: 21\n80.  The absence of clear standards guiding the discretion of the public official \nvested with the authority to enforce the enactment invites abuse by enabling the official \nto administer the policy on the basis of impermissible factors.  Leonardson v. City of East \nLansing, 896 F.2d 190, 198 (6th Cir. 1990). \n81.  The vagueness doctrine “requires that the limits the [government] claims \nare implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or \nadministrative construction, or well-established practice.”  City of Lakewood v. Plain \nDealer Publ’g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 770 (1988). \n82.  A traditional public forum like a park or public sidewalk is subject to \nreasonable “time, place and manner” restrictions that are narrowly tailored to serve a \nsignificant  government  interest  and  leave  open  ample  alternative  channels  of \ncommunication.  Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 \n(1983). \n83.  A designated public forum is a forum the government intentionally opens \nto expressive activity to the public at large.  Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, \n534 (6th Cir. 2010).  The standards under the First  Amendment are the same as a \ntraditional public forum.  Pleasant Grove v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 469–70 (2009). \n84.  “The campus of a public university, at least for its students, possesses \nmany of the characteristics of a public forum.”  Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 267 n.5 \n(1981). \n85.  As noted above, the board of trustees of the University of Cincinnati has \ndeclared that the university is “dedicated to providing an environment conducive to \nteaching, learning, research, and a continuing search for truth.” \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 22 of 28  PAGEID #: 22\n86.  Thus, the campus of the University of Cincinnati (or, at least, areas other \nthan the Free Speech Area) constitute dedicated public fora in which students, including \nPlaintiffs, are entitled to engage in speech protected under the First Amendment.  And \nsome areas of the campus of the University of Cincinnati (including the public sidewalks \nadjacent to various streets) constitute traditional public fora. \n \nCOUNT I \n \nVIOLATION OF RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH UNDER \nTHE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n  \n87.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein.  \n88.  The policies and actions of Defendants vest unfettered discretion in the \nDefendants to restrict constitutionally protected expression. \n89.  The policies and actions of Defendants are prior restraints and restrictions \non speech in campus areas that are commonly considered traditional or designated public \nfora. \n90.  The  Defendants’  purported  “time,  place  and  manner”  restrictions  are \nunreasonable in light of the purpose of the forum, overly broad, not content-neutral, are \nnot narrowly tailored to serve significant government interests, and do not leave open \nample alternative channels of communication. \n91.  As  a  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  actions,  Plaintiffs  have  been \nirreparably injured, and will continue in the future to be irreparably injured, in that they \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 23 of 28  PAGEID #: 23\nhave been and will be deprived of their right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the Constitution.  \n92.  As  a  direct  result  of  the  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  rights  and  the  continued  maintenance  of  the  Use  of  Facilities  Policy, \nPlaintiffs continue to be prohibited from engaging their fellow students in discussion, \nadvocating on behalf of their political beliefs, and collecting sufficient signatures to \nsuccessfully place the Ohio Workplace Freedom Amendment on the November 2012 \nballot. \n93.  As a legal consequence of the Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as alleged above, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief \nand, from John Doe, to recover nominal damages. \nCOUNT II \n \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS \nUNDER THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n  \n94.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n95.  The policies and conduct of Defendants are unconstitutionally vague on \ntheir face.  They fail to adequately advise, notify, or inform students threatened with \ndisciplinary action and criminal prosecution for violation, and thus have a chilling effect \non speech. \n96.  The Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of limiting the expressive \nactivities on campus it defines as constituting a “demonstration, picket, or rally” to the \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 24 of 28  PAGEID #: 24\nFree Speech Area is unconstitutional and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution. \n97.  The Defendants’ policy, practice and custom of allowing its agents or \nother  authorized  individuals  unbridled  discretion  in  determining  which  expressive \nactivities constitute a “demonstration, picket, or rally” – and thus are subject to the \nnotification requirement of ten working days and limited to the Free Speech Area – \nviolates Plaintiffs’ rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \n98.  As  a  proximate  result  of  Defendants’  actions,  Plaintiffs  have  been \nirreparably injured, and will continue in the future to be irreparably injured, in that they \nhave been and will be deprived of their right to free speech and due process of law under \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  \n99.  As  a  direct  result  of  the  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights, Plaintiffs are at continued risk of being unable to engage their fellow \nstudents in discussion, advocate on behalf of their political beliefs, and collect sufficient \nsignatures  to  successfully  place  the  Ohio  Workplace  Freedom  Amendment  on  the \nNovember 2012 ballot. \n100.  As a legal consequence of the Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as alleged above, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief \nand to recover nominal damages. \n \n \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 25 of 28  PAGEID #: 25\n \nCOUNT III \n  \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTION \n(28 U.S.C. § 2201, et seq.) \n \n101.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n102.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants concerning Plaintiffs’ rights under the United States Constitution.  A judicial \ndeclaration is necessary and appropriate at this time as to Counts I through II above.   \n103.  Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights against Defendants \nas they pertain to Plaintiffs’ right to speak, assemble, and gather signatures on petitions \non the outdoor areas campus of the University of Cincinnati without being subjected to a \nprior restraint or “time, place, and manner” regulations which are unreasonable, not \ncontent neutral, not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest, and do \nnot leave open ample alternative channels of communication. \n104.  In order to prevent further violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights by \nDefendants, it is appropriate and proper that a declaratory judgment be issued, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and FED. R. CIV. P. 57, declaring unconstitutional the University’s \npolicies. \n105.  Furthermore, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202 and FED. R. CIV. P. 65, it is \nappropriate and hereby requested that this Court issue a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the Defendants from enforcing their \nrestrictions on Plaintiffs’ expressive activities to the extent they are unconstitutional, in \norder to prevent the ongoing violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 26 of 28  PAGEID #: 26\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  pray  for  judgment  against  Defendants  and  that  the \nCourt: \nA.  Declare that the notice and forum provisions of the University’s Use of \nFacilities Policy Manual described above are unconstitutional on their face \nbecause they violate the rights to freedom of speech and due process of \nlaw  guaranteed  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the \nConstitution; \nB.  Declare that the notice and forum provisions of the University’s Use of \nFacilities Policy Manual are unconstitutional as applied or threatened to be  \napplied to the activities of Plaintiffs, because they violate Plaintiffs’ right \nto freedom of speech and due process of law guaranteed under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution; \nC.  Declare that restricting students’ expressive activities to the Free Speech \nArea violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution;  \nD.  Issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent \ninjunction  against  the  Defendants  and  all  agents,  administrators, \nemployees,  or  other  persons  acting  on  behalf  of  the  University,  from \nenforcing said policies against Plaintiffs and others who seek to participate \nin expressive activities both within the Free Speech Area and on sidewalks \nand outdoor open areas such as those described in this Complaint;  \nE.

As with all state, federal and local entities, “public” \ndoes not mean that all areas are open to the general public.   The are some areas, such as sport \nand performing arts venues, shops and restaurants, where access by the general public is \npermitted, and in many cases, encouraged.  On the other hand, classrooms, laboratories, \nacademic offices, student lounges and other educational and research venues are not open to the \ngeneral public but are for the most part limited to the use of faculty, students, staff and invited \nguests who have business related to the mission of the University (the “University Community”).  \n \nWhen a building contains areas that are designated as open to the general public, access is \nlimited to those areas and only during specified hours.  Unless otherwise posted, most public \naccess areas are accessible by the general public during normal business hours (Monday – Friday \nfrom 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM).  During other days and/or hours, all areas in the building are \nrestricted to the University Community. \n \nAs noted above, there are some exceptions to this restriction; such as when a public event is \nbeing held in a university building; e.g. CCM performances, athletic events, meetings open to the \npublic, etc., or when a building contains areas intended for public/guest/alumni use; e.g. \nbookstores, libraries, restaurants, recreation areas, etc.   \n \nThere are some facilities that are restricted, even during normal business hours, and not all areas \nof the University are open to all members of the University Community. These areas are posted \nand/or locked. (Access to residence halls is restricted at all hours to residents, registered guests \nand authorized staff.)  \n \n \nUse of Storage Facilities on Campus \nThe University of Cincinnati does not permit use of any storage areas or facilities (such as \nlockers, cabinets, etc.) by anyone without express permission.  Items found stored in violation of \nthis section of the Use of Facilities Policy Manual will be confiscated and disposed of in \naccordance with the law concerning found property and/or contraband, as indicated by the type \nof property. \n \n \n  3\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 4 of 63  PAGEID #: 32\n \nGENERAL POLICIES PERTAINING TO THE USE OF UNIVERSITY FACILITIES \nThe policies stated herein were developed by the Use of Facilities Policy Committee.  They were \napproved by the Academic and Administrative Councils and the President of the University of \nCincinnati and are administered and interpreted by the appropriate scheduling office.  Appeals \nrelated to the application of these policies are to be referred to the Use of Facilities Policy \nCommittee for review.  These policies are not applicable to the Housing and Food Services \nOffice or Hospital patient care areas which have their own separate policies. \nThe facilities of the University are the property of the State of Ohio, and are subject to all \napplicable state laws, rules and regulations.  \nNon-University individuals or groups can schedule use of University facilities within certain \nlimitations. \nThe following priority is used for scheduling facilities: \n1.  Academic classes \n2.  Academic related activities \n3.  Activities sponsored or co-sponsored by the University of a University group. \n4.  Activities sponsored by a non-University group. \n \nA non-University group may reserve facilities only if comparable facilities are not available \ncommercially elsewhere in the local community.  Requests by non-University groups for use of \nUniversity facilities for activities which are in competition with the University’s educational or \ncultural offerings (classes, seminars, etc.), are not approved.  Determination of whether \ncompetition exists is decided by the appropriate scheduling office in consultation with academic \nand administrative units. \nThe University of Cincinnati reserves the right to change facility assignments or to cancel any \npreviously scheduled facility if such change or cancellation is made to meet University needs.  \nThe University is not responsible for any costs or damages suffered by a sponsoring group as a \nresult of such change or cancellation. \nResponsibilities of All Groups/Individuals Using University Facilities \nThe sponsor must conduct an event in a manner that complies with all policies regarding the use \nof University facilities.  The sponsor assumes total responsibility including, but not limited to \nfinancial and legal obligations for an event using University facilities.  Specific smoking and use \nof alcohol regulations apply to University facilities and are detailed in Appendices B and C.  \nGroups and individuals who sponsor an event are responsible for any loss or damage incurred by \nthe University resulting from their occupancy of University facilities. \n \nRental Charges and Expenses \nA standard rental charge is made for the use of University facilities by a non-University group.  \nNo rental charge is made for the use of facilities for an event sponsored by the University or a \nUniversity group held during hours when campus buildings are regularly open unless admission \nis charged or donations are requested.  No rental charges are made for the use of facilities for \nevents if the University is compensated through other direct methods, i.e., tuition, fees and/or \n  4\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 5 of 63  PAGEID #: 33\ngrants.  Rental charges may be obtained from the appropriate scheduling office.  Student \norganizations sponsoring events involving admission charges or donations must obtain approval \nof the Student Activities and Leadership Development’s Financial Advisor.  All rental charges \nare payable two weeks in advance of the event.  Charges are assessed to all groups for direct \nexpenses incurred as a result of occupancy beyond regular hours, special equipment, set-ups, \nservices, and personnel required to service an event.  All charges are based on the University \nSchedule of Charges for Use of Facilities on file in the appropriate scheduling offices.  Requests \nfor exceptions to established charges or advance payment are referred to the Use of Facilities \nPolicy Committee. \nPayment of all charges for the use of University facilities and services is the responsibility of the \ngroup and/or the agent representing the group.  If the group does not meet its financial \nobligations to the University, the individual who requested use of facility is responsible for the \npayment.  University groups which co-sponsor an event with a non-University group or \norganization are responsible for any financial and legal obligations incurred if not settled by the \nnon-University group.  Non-University groups must pay all outstanding charges within thirty \n(30) days following issuance by the University of a Statement of charges incurred unless \notherwise stipulated in a signed contract. \nSafety and Security \nDue to fire safety and building code regulations, stairways and corridors within buildings may \nnot be used as gathering places or for holding events.  Security requirements for all events using \nUniversity facilities are determined by the University Department of Public Safety.  Compliance \nwith all safety and security laws is the responsibility of the sponsoring group or individual, but \nthe University Police have the ultimate authority to insure compliance with all rules, regulations \nand laws.  Persons present on University property are subject to the authority of the University \nPolice.  Non-University groups must obtain and maintain public liability insurance covering \nbodily injury and property damage in an amount to be determined by the appropriate scheduling \noffice.  A security deposit may be required. \nThe authority to determine the number of police/security personnel assigned to an event, their \npost/are of assignment, and their duties rests with the Department of Public Safety. \nThe University Police Officer assigned to an event shall insure compliance with safety rules, \nregulations, and laws.  The use of firearms (including blanks), explosives, and/or pyrotechnics is \nprohibited without the express written permission of the Department of Public Safety. \n \nPolitical Programs and Activities \nUniversity groups may sponsor a political candidate for speaking engagements only.  University \nfacilities may not be used for political fundraising activities where solicitations of funds, \ndonations or similar activities take place.

The Campus Scheduling Office schedules the use of academic \nspace for conferences, meeting and events when class is not in session and on weekends.   The \nDivision of Registration and Scheduling coordinates the scheduling of academic space for other \ncourses convening after 6:30 p.m. \nEast Campus \nCollege of Medicine facilities in the Health Professions Building and the Medical Sciences \nBuilding may be used only when scheduled and confirmed in advance.  An Application to \nSchedule Facilities must be completed for each event and submitted to the Medical Art and \nDesign Services (MADS) for approval.  Consideration for the use of facilities is given to \ncomplete, signed, written applications only.  No oral requests will be honored.  Final approval \nand rental charges for the use of facilities are based on the type and scope of the event, the \nfinancial arrangements, and the department or organization responsible for the event.  Facilities \nare reserved “as is.”  No arrangement of equipment, personnel, or services is included or implied \nwith the confirmation of any College of Medicine facility.  Facilities are not officially reserved \nuntil a signed confirmation copy of the application is received by the applicant from MADS. \nCollege of Medicine academic classes and exams have the highest priority and supercede all \nother use of facilities.  Monday-Friday 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., facilities are reserved exclusively \nfor academic classes and exams, College of Medicine, Medical Center and University sponsored \nevents only.

No other College \nof Medicine facility is available for non-University events at any time. \nThe Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing each schedule the use of their own facilities at the \nrespective college office.  Room reservations for the College of Pharmacy required courses,  \n  9\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 10 of 63  PAGEID #: 38\n \nelective courses, seminars, and other programs are scheduled in preference to all other room \nreservation requests.  Room reservations for the College of Nursing and Health must be made as \nfar in advance as possible.  Room assignments are made in a manner that will accommodate the \nnumber of students and best utilize the Procter Hall facilities.  College of Nursing Health \nfacilities may be reserved for conferences, meetings, or other special purposes on a one-time \nonly basis.  These reservations must be made far enough in advance to avoid conflict in \nscheduling.  Requests for special arrangements of chairs, tables, etc., must be made two weeks in \nadvance. \nBranch Campuses \nClassrooms, seminar rooms, and laboratories are scheduled through the individual college \noffices.  At Raymond Walters College, OMI College of Applied Science, and Clermont College, \nclassrooms used for academic purposes are requested on a class order form or by memo through \nthe college office.  Classrooms for non-academic purposes are scheduled via memo or forms \nthrough the Business Office. \nProcedures: \nScheduling of teaching laboratories and special purpose rooms is accomplished through the \nindividual departments or colleges responsible for those facilities.  However, the usage of these \nrooms is reported to the Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling when \nthe class orders are submitted.  All requests for specific classrooms, seminar rooms and \nauditoria, must be directed to the Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and \nScheduling, on a class order form each quarter.  A class order may be placed at any point in the \nquarter and students have access to the course through the registration process on the same day \nthe class order is placed.  To have the class published in “Learning Opportunities,” the schedule \nof classes, a class order must be placed by a specific deadline date three (3) to six (6) months in \nadvance of the start of the quarter.  If no room is available, the class order will not be entered and \nthe college/department will be notified that the class order is being held until a room opens at the \nrequested time or the department will be offered alternate, open time slots. \nEach college and/or department is given preference in their own building or in adjacent buildings \nas space permits.  Classes are scheduled into classrooms based on estimated enrollment when the \nmix of rooms available allows a match of the room with the estimated enrollment.  Requests for \nthe use of specific classrooms on a preferred basis may be made, but there is no guarantee that \nthe specific room requested will be scheduled.  Although the scheduling office prefers to keep all \nclasses in the same room each quarter, the changing mix of course/selections each quarter \nincluding on quarter courses, and trailer courses, makes it impossible to keep all continuing \ncourses in the rooms that they occupied in the Autumn Quarter. \nExtra (all-quarter) one day meeting times called “extra rooms” for regularly scheduled academic \ncourses are scheduled only after all other academic scheduling has occurred.  One day meetings \nare currently not scheduled until the week before the quarter begins. \nOn the West Campus, large auditoria scheduling occurs once annually in January for the next \nacademic year.  Large auditoria request forms are delivered to all colleges and Arts and Sciences \ndepartments in December each year, and are due the first week of January.  Scheduling is  \n  10\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 11 of 63  PAGEID #: 39\n \naccomplished before February 1 so that college/departments know their large auditoria schedule \nin order to plan their other course requests before Autumn class orders are due.  After the \nschedule for large auditoria is published, a course/section may not change the day or time.  \nRemaining space may be requested for use by any college/department and it is granted whenever \npossible.  The Office of the Registrar, Division of Registration and Scheduling has final authority \nto move course/sections if the need arises, especially if a larger course/section needs one of these \nlarge auditoria.  On the East Campus, large auditoria scheduling arrangements are made though \nthe college offices. \nOnce the scheduling process of course/sections is completed for a quarter (about 45 days before \nclasses begin), classroom assignments are sent to each college.  Once room assignments are \npublished and circulated, a college/department may request a room change.  Since room \nassignments are published on schedule/bills, room changes should not be made unless absolutely \nnecessary.  The students receive no notice that a room change has occurred prior to going to the \nfirst class meeting where a room change sign is posted directing them to the new room.  Room \nchange requests are accomplished through the department or college to keep them updated as to \nthe new location of the course.  Room change requests are honored if a room is available that \nwill accommodate the course/section enrollment.  Over subscription due to closed course \npetitioning should be avoided. \nClassroom Time Blocks \nAll undergraduate classes (excluding laboratories) are scheduled at regular times as defined \nbelow: \n•  Monday, Wednesday, Friday on the hour in 50 minute time blocks \n•  Tuesday and Thursday on the hour or half hour in 1 ½ hour time blocks \n \nGraduate courses may be scheduled in 2 to 3 hour time blocks, but they should begin and end on \nthe hour Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or on the hour or half hour on Tuesday and Thursday. \n \nFree Hours \nThe University has a Free Hour on Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.  For \nscheduling purposes, any course with a meeting time that crosses through that hour is considered \nas meeting during the Free Hour.  Permission to use the Free Hour for classroom scheduling is \ngiven with the proviso that only multiple section courses are scheduled during that time period.  \nThe proviso is made primarily so that those students and faculty involved in campus activities \nmay select another section if necessary.  Colleges and departments which find it necessary to \nschedule a single section course during the Free Hour must request an exception to the Free Hour \nPolicy.  Such requests should be in writing to the Director of Registration and Scheduling.  \nWritten notification is sent to the requesting department following review. \n  11\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 12 of 63  PAGEID #: 40\n \nSection II - \nNON-ACADEMIC FACILITIES \n \nProcedures \nThe Campus Scheduling Office, 265 Tangeman University Center (556-2442) is responsible for \nscheduling all University facilities including exterior open space on West Campus when they are \nnot in use for academic purposes.

These posting boards are located across campus in high traffic areas for high \nvisibility.     \nTemporary directional signs for special campus events and activities shall be located according \nto a pre-approved plan prepared and submitted by sponsoring college, department or university \norganization and posted on mobile boards or portable day-event boards as outlined in the \nuniversity’s Signage Policy and Standard. \n \nAllowable Sizes:  Temporary signs for posting on approved signboards and kiosks shall be a \nmaximum size of 20” x 30”.  Temporary directional signs shall be a maximum size of 30” x 40”. \nAllowable Materials:  Temporary signs shall be constructed of weather-resistant material.  \nWaterproof paints or inks must be used.  Wire frame supports shall not be allowed. \nAllowable Posting Time:  Temporary signs located on signboards and kiosks may be posted one \nweek prior to the event or program advertised in the sign and must be removed within five \ncalendar days following the event.   \nTemporary directional signs shall be put in place the first day of the relative event or program \nand removed no later than the day following the event or program. \nProcedure for Temporary Sign Approval:  No prior approval for freestanding or wall mounted \nposting board signs complying with the guidelines noted above will be required.  Temporary \ndirectional signs using mobile boards or portable day-event boards must be requested at lease \ntwo weeks in advance of the specific event along with a site location plan for the requested signs.  \nRequests should be submitted to the Campus Scheduling Office. \n \n \nTENT AND CANOPY USE ON CAMPUS \nGeneral: \nGroups desiring to erect a tent or canopy on campus for an event need to be aware that various \nfire and building code requirements apply to these structures.  In general, permits from the state \n  61\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 62 of 63  PAGEID #: 90\nare NOT required for tents which are 200 square feet (10’ x 20’) or smaller.  A tent is a fabric \nstructure with more than two side walls. \nState permits are NOT required for canopies which are 400 square feet (20’ x 20’).  A canopy is \na fabric structure with up to two sides.  In the case of a canopy with no side walls, it may have a \nmaximum size of 700 square feet (20’ x 35’) without a permit being required.  If multiple \ncanopies are used, they must be at least 12 feet apart. \nIn all cases, a clearance of at least 12 feet must be maintained from buildings.  Also groups \nshould keep in mind that many grass areas on campus have buried utilities and sprinkler lines.  \nPlacement of poles or stakes into the ground must avoid these locations. \nWhile UC will endeavor to obtain the necessary permits, it is the ultimate responsibility of the \nevent organizer to have the permits prior to the day of the event.  Should the permits not be \nobtained, the event may not occur.   \n \nRequest to erect a tent or canopy: \nWhenever tens and canopies are going to be erected, notice must be given to Public Safety at \nleast ten business days in advance.  The Fire Prevention Unit will review the plan and assist the \nsponsoring group with any required state permits.  Whenever possible we will assist you in \ndesigning your event to avoid or minimize the required state permits and costs.  Send completed \ntent/canopy request forms to the Fire Prevention Unit at Mail Location 180.  If you have \nquestions or need assistance please call us at 556-4934. \n \nSignage and Safety Equipment: \nEach tent or canopy erected must have a fire extinguisher mounted in a visible location.  The \nextinguisher must be a 5 or 10 pound dry chemical, type ABC.  The company renting the tent \nshould be able to provide this extinguisher and a stand to mount it on. \nEach tent or canopy erected must have one or more no smoking signs posted so that they are \nvisible throughout the structure.  The no smoking signs must be at least 8” x 10” in size, with at \nleast 2” lettering. \n \nCooking Equipment and Open Flame: \nThe use of cooking equipment, grills, and any open flame is not permitted inside a tent or \ncanopy.  Please be aware that if you are planning on using this type of equipment outside the tent \nor canopy, a separate permit and inspection process is involved, although this is also coordinated \nthrough the Fire Prevention unit. \n \nSound and Lighting Equipment: \nThe use of public address systems inside a tent or canopy is permitted as long as they electrical \nsupply is protected by a Ground Fault Interrupter.  The use of any lighting equipment requires a \npermit and inspection from the state Industrial Compliance office (see Permit Fees below).  \nElectrical service must be requested from Facilities Management. \n \nPermit Fees: \nWhen the use of tents or canopies requires state permits, the State Fire Marshall and the State \nIndustrial Compliance office both charge user fees.  UC is not exempt from these fees, and the \ngroup sponsoring the event must pay the fees.  The State Fire Marshall’s office charges a fee of \n  62\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-1 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 63 of 63  PAGEID #: 91\n$75.00 per event for inspecting tents, regardless of the number involved.  If your event uses one \ntent or twenty, the fee is always $75.00. \nThe industrial Compliance fee schedule is considerably more complicated.  The base fee is \n$228.25 for EACH tent or canopy.  If the tent/canopy is wired for electricity there is an \nadditional fee of $175.00 and if the tent/canopy has a mechanical system to provide ventilation \n(fans/Heat/air conditioning) there is another fee of $175.00.  So if you intend to use a single tent \nwith lights and fans, the Industrial Compliance fee for that tent is $578.25. \n \nInspections: \nIn all cases where a tent or canopy is being used on campus, an inspection is required.  Where a \npermit is required from the State Fire Marshall or from Industrial Compliance, those offices will \ninspect the installation.  Where no state permit is required then the University of Cincinnati’s \nFire Prevention unit will inspect the installation.  If this inspection can be completed during \nnormal business hours, there is no charge for the inspection.  If it must be done after hours, then \nthe sponsoring organization must pay the overtime costs. \n \n \n  63\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-2 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 1  PAGEID #: 92\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-3 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 4  PAGEID #: 93\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-3 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 2 of 4  PAGEID #: 94\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-3 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 3 of 4  PAGEID #: 95\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-3 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 4 of 4  PAGEID #: 96\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-4 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 2  PAGEID #: 97\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-4 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 2 of 2  PAGEID #: 98\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-5 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 1  PAGEID #: 99\n \n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-6 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 2  PAGEID #: 100\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-6 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 2 of 2  PAGEID #: 101\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-7 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 3  PAGEID #: 102\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-7 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 2 of 3  PAGEID #: 103\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-7 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 3 of 3  PAGEID #: 104\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-8 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 1  PAGEID #: 105\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-9 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 4  PAGEID #: 106\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-9 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 2 of 4  PAGEID #: 107\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-9 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 3 of 4  PAGEID #: 108\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-9 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 4 of 4  PAGEID #: 109\n\nCase: 1:12-cv-00155-TSB Doc #: 1-10 Filed: 02/22/12 Page: 1 of 1  PAGEID #: 110\nJS 44   (Rev. 12/07)                                     CIVIL COVER SHEET\nThe JS 44 civil cover sheet and the information contained herein neither replace nor supplement the filing and service of pleadings or other papers as required by law,  except as provided\nby local rules of court.

Sisko’s Motion is directed at the \nallegations set forth in the First Amended Complaint (Doc. 15). Plaintiffs have also filed \na Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 43) on the claims asserted in the First \nAmended Complaint.  Because the Court has granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File \nthe Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 47), the First Amended Complaint is no longer the \noperative complaint, and motions directed at that pleading are now moot. See Yates v. \nApplied Performance Techs., Inc., 205 F.R.D. 497, 499 (S.D. Ohio 2002) (“Because \namended complaints supersede the original pleading, the filing of the amended complaint \nin this case did technically render the pending motion to dismiss moot.”); see also Doc. \n53 at 2 (Defendant acknowledges that if the Court grants leave to amend she “will then \nfile a new motion to dismiss, which may rely on different grounds”). \n  \n  Accordingly, Defendant Brittany Sisko’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 37) and \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 43) are DENIED AS MOOT. \n \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDate: June 12, 2012            s/Timothy S.
