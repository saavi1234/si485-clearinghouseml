    "summary": "<p>On April 10, 2012, the Public Defender of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Luzerne County. Represented by the ACLU of Pennsylvania, the plaintiff alleged that his termination was threatened because of complaints he had made against the county about the lack of funding for the public defender's office, lack of attorneys for the public defender's office, and inability to adequately represent clients. The plaintiff alleged that the threatened termination would violate his 1st and 14th Amendment rights and he sought injunctive relief. The plaintiff also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent his removal from the position of Chief Public Defender for Luzerne County, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and attorneys' fees.</p><p>The same day, the plaintiff in this case, along with citizens who were unable to obtain a public defender based on lack of availability, filed a class action in state court under the Civil Rights Act, §1983, and Article I, § 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The class action sought to compel the County to increase resources for the Public Defender. Plaintiffs requested an order requiring Defendants to promptly appoint private or conflict counsel when the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) declines representation of any adult defendant due to excessive workloads or lack of resources. The plaintiffs also sought a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to lift the hiring freeze; an order allowing the plaintiff Public Defender to continue with his work until the OPD had adequate resources to represent all indigent adult criminal defendants prosecuted in Luzerne County; a peremptory judgment compelling defendants to provide necessary funding so that the OPD is capable of providing representation to all qualified indigent defendants prosecuted in Luzerne County that satisfy the standards set by the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions; and attorneys' fees and costs.</p><p>In the federal court case, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. On April 19, 2012, the parties entered a stipulation requesting withdrawal of the plaintiff's request for preliminary injunction. The judge approved the request to withdraw that same day. The terms of the withdrawal stipulated that the plaintiff shall remain in his official capacity as public defender, that he will not be subject to any adverse employment action in retaliation for protected First Amendment activity, and that his job was not in imminent danger. The case was dismissed on March 11, 2013.</p><p>The class action was assigned to Judge Joseph Augello. On June 15, 2012, Judge Augello ordered the county to lift the hiring freeze, immediately provide confidential meeting space for OPD clients and lawyers, provide counsel for people turned away from the OPD either by hiring private counsel or by expanding OPD, and not to turn away any more indigent clients. Judge Aurello also ordered the parties to meet and create a plan to fix the problems with OPD. The parties attended mediation for months but could not agree to a solution. The county replaced the Chief Public Defender in April 2013 and asked the court to dismiss the class action, arguing that only the chief public defender could sue the county over the condition of the OPD. Judge Augello agreed with the county and dismissed the case on October 22, 2013. </p><p>The plaintiffs for the class action appealed to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, arguing that the clients of the OPD were entitled to bring suit to protect their rights. On October 14, 2014, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court affirmed the ruling. As part of its opinion, the Court noted that mandamus was not an available form of relief because the Appellants had not demonstrated a clear right to relief.</p><p>The plaintiffs next appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which changed the name to <i>Kuren v. Luzerne</i> to reflect the that Flora was no longer a party to the suit. Because of the importance of the case, the U.S. Department of Justice as well as numerous national legal organizations, including the American Bar Association and the Innocence Project, filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of the plaintiffs.</p><p>In a landmark opinion issued on September 28, 2016, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted that <i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i> extends the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to state courts, and also noted that Sixth Amendment violations need not await conviction and sentencing. As such, the Court ruled that public defender clients have the right to sue counties to force them to provide adequate funding to their public defender offices, as long as they demonstrate “the likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies at law.” Here, the Court found that the plaintiffs met that standard by demonstrating the possible risk of injury due to Luzerne County’s alleged failure to provide adequate funding.</p><p>With respect to the mandamus, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision, ruling that the writ of mandamus was not an available remedy in this case. The Court stated that mandamus is employed to compel the performance of a ministerial duty, or to compel action in matters involving judgment and discretion. It is not used to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way, as the Appellants sought here by requesting that the hiring freeze be lifted.</p><p>The case was remanded for proceedings consistent with the opinion. The docket for the trial court's proceedings could not be found. The case is now closed.</p>",

The class action suit sought to compel the County to increases resources for the Public Defender.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that the indigent clients had a rightful cause of action.",

INTERESTS OF AMICUS CURIAE \nThe American Bar Association (“ABA”), as amicus curiae, respectfully submits \nthis brief in support of Appellants and the class they seek to represent with respect to the first \nquestion presented: \nIn a matter of first impression, do petitioners [i.e., Appellants] state \na claim for constructive denial of counsel under the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and \nArticle 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, based on \nchronic and systemic deficiencies in the operation of Luzerne \nCounty’s Office of the Public Defender [“OPD”] that deprive them \nand the class they seek to represent of their right to effective \nassistance of counsel? \nThe ABA urges the Court to answer this question in the affirmative.  All criminal defendants—\nregardless of their means—are entitled to representation at all critical stages of the proceedings \nagainst them that meets the constitutional mandate of Gideon v. Wainwright.   But here, \nAppellants have asserted that chronic and systemic funding deficiencies, and the resulting \nexcessive workloads and lack of resources, prevent OPD and its attorneys from providing all \nclients with the competent and diligent representation required by the Pennsylvania Rules of \nProfessional Conduct and articulated in ABA professional standards.  In such a situation, a cause \nof action for prospective relief based on constructive denial of counsel should be recognized to \nensure that, at all critical stages, indigent criminal defendants receive the actual, non-trivial \nrepresentation that Gideon demands. \nThe ABA is one of the largest voluntary professional membership organizations \nand the leading association of legal professionals in the United States.  It has more than 400,000 \nmembers, who come from all fifty states and other jurisdictions, including over 12,000 attorneys \n \n \n\n \nin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.1  Members include attorneys in private law firms, \ncorporations, nonprofit organizations, federal, state and local governmental agencies, and \nprosecutorial and public defender offices.  They are also judges,2 legislators, law professors, law \nstudents, and non-lawyers in related fields. \nSince its founding in 1878, the ABA has taken a special responsibility for \nadvocating for the ethical and effective representation of all clients.  In 1908, the ABA adopted \nits first Canons of Professional Ethics, setting out the duties owed by lawyers to their clients.  \nContinually revised and updated over the years, they are now the ABA Model Rules of \nProfessional Conduct.3  Although the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct control in the \npresent case, they were derived from the ABA Model Rules.  See Pa.R.P.C., Preamble at ¶ 20.  \nThe Pennsylvania and ABA Model Rules pertinent to the issues before the Court are identical.  \nSee, e.g., Pa.R.P.C. 1.1 & ABA Model Rule 1.1 (“A lawyer shall provide competent \nrepresentation to a client[, which] includes the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and \npreparation reasonably necessary for the representation.”); Pa. R.P.C.1.3 & ABA Model Rule 1.3 \n(“A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.”).  \n                                                 \n1Based on ABA membership records for fiscal year 2015-2016. \n2Neither this brief nor the decision to file it should be interpreted to reflect the views of \nany judicial member of the ABA.  No inference should be drawn that any member of the Judicial \nDivision Council participated in the adoption or endorsement of the positions in this brief. This \nbrief was not circulated to any member of the Judicial Division prior to filing. \n3Available at http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/ \npublications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct.html.  Each iteration of the ABA’s \nprofessional conduct rules has been adopted as ABA policy.  Only resolutions adopted by vote of \nthe ABA’s House of Delegates become ABA policy.  Today, the ABA’s House of Delegates is \ncomposed of over 560 delegates representing states and territories, local and state bar \nassociations, affiliated organizations, ABA sections and divisions, ABA members and the \nAttorney General of the United States, among others.  See ABA House of Delegates - General \nInformation, http://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/delegates.html. \n-2- \n \n\n \nNeither the Pennsylvania Rules nor the ABA Model Rules provide an exception to Rules 1.1 and \n1.3 for public defenders. \nIndeed, in 2006, the ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional \nResponsibility (“ABA Ethics Committee”) issued Formal Opinion 06-441 (“Ethical Obligations \nof Lawyers Who Represent Indigent Criminal Defendants When Excessive Caseloads Interfere \nWith Competent and Diligent Representation”) (attached as Exhibit A), which concluded that \nABA Model Rules 1.1 and 1.3 apply equally to public defenders.4  Created in 1913, the ABA \nEthics Committee is charged with publishing formal ethics opinions on lawyer and judicial \nconduct, providing informal responses to ethics inquiries, and, upon request, assisting courts in \ntheir development of professional rules and in the interpretation of ethical standards, such as the \nABA Model Rules and the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. \nThe ABA has also worked to improve the criminal justice system and the \nrepresentation of criminal defendants.  This includes the development of the ABA Criminal \nJustice Standards.5  Begun under the aegis of then-ABA President (and later Justice) Lewis \nPowell during the year after Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), was decided, the \nCriminal Justice Standards are based on the consensus views of a broad array of criminal justice \n                                                 \n4ABA standing committees are entities charged with investigating and analyzing \n“continuing or recurring matters related to the purposes or business” of the ABA.  ABA Const. \nArt. 31.3.  Further information on the ABA Ethics Committee is available at \nhttp://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/committees_commissions/ethics\nandprofessionalresponsibility.html. \n5Available at http://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/standards.html.  The \nCriminal Justice Standards, which are also ABA policy, are now published in twenty volumes, \nbased on topical area.  They were developed and continue to be refined by task forces made up \nof prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, academics, the public and other representatives with \ncriminal justice interests, as well as the diverse membership of the ABA.

The Eight Guidelines recommend various ways for public defenders to attempt to \navoid excessive workloads, but recognize that, at times, it may be necessary to turn to the courts \nto remedy the situation.  Id. at Comment to Guideline 5 (“When a Provider cannot reduce \nexcessive lawyer workloads, a motion filed with the court, aimed at stopping case assignments \nand/or permitting lawyers to withdraw from cases . . . , or conceivably the filing of a separate \ncivil action, will be necessary.”); see also ABA Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery \nSystem, Principle 5 (2002) (“Defense counsel’s workload is controlled to permit the rendering of \nquality representation.”).9 \nBased on these and other results of the ABA’s 100-plus years of research, \nanalysis, and development of professional norms for effective representation of clients, the ABA \nhas participated previously as amicus in other state supreme court cases that have addressed \nissues resulting from chronic and systemic underfunding of public defender systems.  See, e.g., \nPublic Defender v. State, 115 So.3d 261 (Fla. 2013); State v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592 (Mo. \n2012);. \nAs in its prior amicus briefs, the ABA assumes here that the public defenders are \nusing public resources efficiently in representing indigent defendants.  The ABA respectfully \nsubmits, however, that this Court should recognize a cause of action for prospective relief where \n                                                 \n9Available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ \nlegal_aid_indigent_defendants/ls_sclaid_def_tenprinciplesbooklet.authcheckdam.pdf.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nAll criminal defendants—regardless of their means—are entitled to legal \nrepresentation at all critical stages of the proceedings against them that meets the constitutional \nmandate of Gideon v. Wainwright.  But here, Appellants have presented significant evidence \ndemonstrating that chronic and systemic funding deficiencies, and the resulting excessive \nworkloads and lack of resources, prevent OPD and its attorneys from providing all clients with \nthe competent and diligent representation required by the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional \nConduct and articulated in ABA professional standards.  A post-conviction Strickland claim, \nwhich turns on after-the-fact identification of an error or errors that affected the outcome of an \nindividual defendant’s trial, is not a means to address such chronic and systemic deficiencies.   \nInstead, a cause of action for prospective relief should be recognized to ensure that, at all critical \nstages, indigent criminal defendants receive the actual, non-trivial representation that Gideon \ndemands. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  This Court Should Recognize A Cause Of Action For Prospective \nRelief Where Excessive Workloads And Lack Of Resources Prevent \nPublic Defenders From Providing All Clients With Competent And \nDiligent Representation. \nThe Commonwealth Court concluded that Appellants had not stated a claim for \nconstructive denial of counsel, holding that Appellants’ only recourse was to bring post-\nconviction claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), “[s]hould the legal \nrepresentation assigned to the[m] prove ineffective and cause them prejudice.”  Flora v. Luzerne \n-6- \n \n\n \nCounty, 103 A.3d 125, 137 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2014).  Yet 52 years of post-Gideon history and \nprecedent show that individual, retrospective ineffective assistance of counsel claims brought \nafter trial cannot address chronic, systemic problems such as those alleged in this case.  \nTherefore, the ABA respectfully submits that this Court should recognize a cause of action \nwhere excessive workloads and lack of funding prevent indigent criminal defendants from \nreceiving the actual, non-trivial representation that Gideon demands.  See United States v. \nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 654-55 (1984) (“‘The Constitution’s guarantee of  assistance of counsel \ncannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.’” (quoting Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 \n(1940)); Waters, 370 S.W.3d at 597 (“[T]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a right to \neffective and competent counsel, not just a pro forma appointment whereby the defendant has \ncounsel in name only.”); Hurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217, 224 (N.Y. 2010) (“Actual \nrepresentation assumes a certain basic representational relationship.”). \n1.  All Criminal Defendants Are Entitled To Competent And \nDiligent Representation, As Required By The Pennsylvania \nRules Of Professional Conduct And Articulated In ABA \nProfessional Standards. \nThe Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, the ABA Model Rules on which \nthey are based, and the ABA’s Criminal Justice Standards establish standards regarding the level \nrepresentation that all clients should be entitled to expect—and demand.  These standards can \nthus provide useful guides in assessing the adequacy of the representation provided by the state \nto indigent criminal defendants.  See, e.g., Frye v. Missouri, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1408 (2012) \n(“Though the standard for counsel’s performance is not determined solely by reference to \ncodified standards of professional practice, these standards can be important guides.”). \nFirst, Pennsylvania Rule 1.1 and the identical ABA Model Rule 1.1 require that \nall lawyers provide their clients “competent” representation.  Each Rule defines “competent” \n-7- \n \n\n \nrepresentation as requiring “the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably \nnecessary for the representation.”  As Comment 5 to Pennsylvania Rule 1.1 and ABA Model \nRule 1.1 emphasizes, an essential element of the competent handling of any matter is “adequate \npreparation.” \nSecond, both Pennsylvania Rule 1.3 and ABA Model Rule 1.3 require that all \nattorneys “act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.”  As Comment \n2 to both Rules states, this requires that a lawyer’s “work load . . . be controlled so that each \nmatter can be handled competently.”  In fact, a lawyer “shall not represent a client or, where \nrepresentation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if: (1) the \nrepresentation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct.”  Pa. R.P.C. 1.16(a); \nABA Model Rule 1.16(a). \nNeither the Pennsylvania Rules nor the ABA Model Rules provide any exception \nfor public defenders.  The ABA Ethics Committee, in Formal Opinion 06-441, specifically \nconsidered the ethical obligations of lawyers who represent indigent criminal defendants when \nexcessive caseloads interfere with competent and diligent representation.  That opinion states:  \n“All lawyers, including public defenders . . . must provide competent and diligent \nrepresentation.”  Id. at 1 (emphasis added) (attached as Exhibit A). \nThird, while the Pennsylvania Rules and the ABA Model Rules provide standards \nfor all lawyers, the ABA’s Defense Function Standards—a subsection of the ABA’s Criminal \nJustice Standards—do so for criminal defense lawyers in particular.  See, e.g., ABA Defense \nFunction Standard 4-1.1(a) (“These Standards are intended to address the performance of \ncriminal defense counsel in all stages of their professional work.”).  Under the Defense Function \nStandards, all criminal defense lawyers, among other things, should investigate the facts \n-8- \n \n\n \n(Standard 4-4.1), research the law (Standard 4-4.6), communicate with clients (Standards 4-3.1, \n4-3.3, 4-3.9, 4-5.1), negotiate with prosecutors (Standards 4-6.1, 4-6.2, 4-6.3), file appropriate \nmotions (Standards 4-5.2, 4-7.11, 4-8.1), and prepare for court (Standard 4-4.6).  In addition, \nunder ABA Defense Function Standard 4-1.8(a), criminal defense lawyers “should not carry a \nworkload that, by reason of its excessive size or complexity, interferes with providing quality \nrepresentation, endangers a client’s interest in independent, thorough, or speedy representation, \nor has a significant potential to lead to the breach of professional obligations.” \n2.  Appellants Have Alleged And Presented Evidence That \nExcessive Workloads And Lack Of Resources Prevent OPD \nAnd Its Attorneys From Providing Competent And Diligent \nRepresentation To All Clients. \nUnder the circumstances alleged in this case, the OPD and its public defenders are \nin an untenable position, as they cannot provide each of their clients the competent and diligent \nrepresentation that the professional standards discussed above demand.  Therefore, using these \nstandards as guides, there are indigent criminal defendants in Luzerne County who are not \nreceiving the level of legal representation to which they are constitutionally entitled.  See, e.g., \nFrye, 132 S. Ct. at 1408 (relying on ABA Standards for Criminal Justice and on several states’ \nrules of professional conduct in assessing constitutional adequacy of counsel); Padilla, 559 U.S. \nat 367 (relying on ABA Criminal Justice Standards); Commonwealth v. Hughes, 865 A.2d 761, \n814 n.56 (Pa. 2004) (relying on ABA Criminal Justice Standards); Commonwealth v. Breaker, \n318 A.2d 354, 357-59 (Pa. 1974) (relying on ABA Criminal Justice Standards and on ABA Code \nof Professional Responsibility, precursor to ABA Model Rules); see also ABA Eight Guidelines \nat Comment to Guideline 5 (recognizing “implicit premise that governments, which establish and \nfund providers of public defense, never intended that the lawyers who furnish the representation \n-9- \n \n\n \nwould be asked to do so if it meant violating their ethical duties pursuant to the professional \nconduct rules”). \nThe trial court concluded that “[t]o describe the current state of affairs in the \nOffice of the Public Defender as approaching crisis stage is not an exaggeration.”  R. 737a.  The \ncourt based its conclusion on the testimony of the OPD’s chief public defender and on the expert \nopinion of Norman Lefstein, Dean Emeritus of Indiana University’s Robert H. McKinney School \nof Law, regarding the excessive workloads of OPD public defenders.  R. 729a-735a.  As Dean \nLefstein testified, due to their workloads, OPD public defenders are unable to comply with their \nfundamental duties to their clients.  R. 636a-37a.  According to Dean Lefstein: \nWhen you have over a hundred clients for whom you are \nsimultaneously responsive, you simply cannot discharge the range \nof duties that you have to those clients; and what occurs . . . is a \nform of triage representation, where you deal only with the most \nimmediate problem of the day, because that is really all you can \ndo.  You’re going to court hearings.  [You’re] shuffling papers and \nyou’re doing the best you can, but you’re not doing what is really \nnecessary. \nR. 637a.  He explained that these extraordinary workloads necessarily prevent indigent criminal \ndefendants in Luzerne County from receiving legal assistance that satisfies the most fundamental \nprofessional standards.  See R. 636a (“[G]iven the case loads that they have, they must \nnecessarily fail to deliver to many of their clients the kind of competent and diligent \nrepresentation that is required by Rules 1.1 and 1.3 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional \nConduct.”); R. 637a (“[T]here are clients who must necessarily, given these case loads, receive \nrepresentation which is not consistent with the duty to be a reasonably competent lawyer under \nthe 6th Amendment.”). \nThis and other testimony in the record support a conclusion that many indigent \ndefendants receive legal representation that does not comply with Gideon’s mandate of actual, \n-10- \n \n\n \nnon-trivial representation.  In fact, they support a conclusion that a professionally acceptable \nlevel of representation simply cannot be provided for each defendant at the critical period \nbetween arraignment and trial.  See Hurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 224 (“[This period is] when \na case must be factually developed and researched, decisions respecting grand jury testimony \nmade, plea negotiations conducted, and pretrial motions filed.  Indeed, it is clear that to deprive a \nperson of counsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging that denial of counsel \nduring trial itself.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nThe ABA has documented similar results of excessive public defender workloads \nand lack of resources in other jurisdictions, too.  See Gideon’s Broken Promise at 38 \n(documenting instances in which public defenders “are burdened by overwhelming caseloads \nand essentially coerced into furnishing representation in defense systems that fail to provide the \nbare necessities for an adequate defense (e.g., sufficient time to prepare, experts, investigators, \nand other paralegals), resulting in routine violations of the Sixth Amendment obligation to \nprovide effective assistance of counsel”); Norman Lefstein, Securing Reasonable Caseloads: \nEthics and Law in Public Defense 12-13, 18 (ABA 2011) (explaining that “[t]here is “abundant \nevidence that those who furnish public defense services across the country have far too many \ncases, and this reality impacts the quality of their representation, often severely eroding the Sixth \nAmendment’s guarantee of the right to counsel,” with workloads sometimes so great that public \ndefenders must forgo any research, investigation, client communication, or motion practice and \nsimply plead clients guilty soon after meeting them).10 \n                                                 \n10Available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/ \nbooks/ls_sclaid_def_securing_reasonable_caseloads.authcheckdam.pdf .  The ABA has issued a \nrange of standards to help public defenders avoid situations in which their workloads make it \nimpossible to satisfy Gideon’s mandate in any meaningful fashion.  See, e.g., ABA Eight \n \n-11- \n \n\n \n3.  Where Excessive Workloads And Lack Of Resources Prevent \nPublic Defenders From Fulfilling Their Fundamental \nProfessional Obligations, Prospective, Systemic Relief Is \nNecessary. \nThe Commonwealth Court rejected the possibility of a “prospective relief” \nconstructive denial of counsel claim for “more funding and resources to an entire office, as \nopposed to relief to individual indigent criminal defendants.”  Flora, 103 A.3d at 136.  \nAccording to the Commonwealth Court, “[s]hould the legal representation assigned to the \nindividual Indigent Clients prove ineffective and cause them prejudice, their recourse is to bring \na post-conviction Strickland claim.”  Id. at 137. \nBut where workloads are excessive and resources are insufficient, a post-\nconviction Strickland claim is not a means for ensuring that indigent criminal defendants receive \nthe representation to which they are constitutionally entitled.  A Strickland claim turns on after-\nthe-fact identification of an error or errors that affected the outcome of an individual defendant’s \n________________________ \nGuidelines at Introduction (providing “detailed action plan” for public defense programs and \ntheir attorneys, “when they are confronted with too many persons to represent and are thus \nprevented from discharging their responsibilities under professional conduct rules”); ABA \nFormal Op. 06-441 at 1 (“If workload prevents a lawyer from providing competent and diligent \nrepresentation to existing clients, she must not accept new clients.”); ABA Resolution 107 at ¶ 4 \n(Aug. 9, 2005) (“Attorneys and defense programs should, consistent with ethical obligations, \ndiscontinue indigent defense representation, and/or decline to accept new cases, when, in the \nexercise of their best professional judgment, workloads are so excessive that representation will \ninterfere with the rendering of quality legal representation or lead to the breach of constitutional \nor professional obligations.”), available at http://www.americanbar.org/ \ncontent/dam/aba/migrated/legalservices/downloads/sclaid/indigentdefense/20110325_aba_res10\n7.authcheckdam.pdf; ABA Ten Principles, Principle 5 (“Defense counsel’s workload is \ncontrolled to permit the rendering of quality representations.”).  These standards recognize, \nhowever, that there are times when litigation is necessary to remedy situations in which public \ndefender workloads prevent the fulfillment of professional standards.  See ABA Eight Principles, \nComment to Guideline 5 (“When a Provider cannot reduce excessive lawyer workloads, a \nmotion filed with the court, aimed at stopping case assignments and/or permitting lawyers to \nwithdraw from cases . . . , or conceivably the filing of a separate civil action, will be necessary.” \n(emphasis added)). \n-12- \n \n\n \ntrial, for which the remedy is generally a new trial for the defendant in that case.  Morris v. \nMathews, 475 U.S. 237, 254 (1986).  Even if successful, such a claim does not require a public \ndefender’s office or the county responsible for it to do anything differently in the future.  It does \nnot compel the office, the county, or the state to make changes—funding, staffing, workload, \noperations, or otherwise—to remedy systemic Gideon failures.  See Waters, 370 S.W.3d at 604 \n(“A criminal appeal simply does not provide a mechanism for review of the caseload protocol \nand the issue in any post-conviction proceeding centers on whether the defendant received a fair \ntrial, not on the broader Sixth Amendment right to counsel that is at issue when considering \nwhether counsel was appointed for all critical stages of the proceeding.”  (emphasis in Waters)). \nIn essence, the Commonwealth Court’s ruling leaves indigent criminal defendants \nwith no meaningful way to enforce even the minimum standards for indigent criminal \nrepresentation that have been developed under Gideon, under other rulings of the United States \nSupreme Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and the courts of other States, and through the \nwork of entities such as the ABA.  Yet as the Supreme Court of Missouri stated, “[n]o case \nsuggests that a court analyze whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been preserved \nat all critical stages only by retrospectively determining that the lack of such counsel deprived \nthe defendant of a fair trial.”  Waters, 370 S.W.3d at 607.  That is because “[t]he constitutional \nright to effective counsel  . . . is a prospective right to have counsel’s advice during [all critical \nstages of] the proceeding and is not merely a retrospective right to have a verdict or plea set aside \nif one can prove that the absence of competent counsel affected the proceeding.”  Id.; see also \nHurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 226 (“[T]he basic constitutional mandate for the provision of \ncounsel to indigent defendants at all critical stages is at risk of being left unmet because of \nsystemic conditions, not by reason of the personal failings and poor professional decisions of \n-13- \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION\nSTANDING COMMITTEE ON ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY\nFormal Opinion 06-441 May 13, 2006\nEthical Obligations of Lawyers Who Represent                                               \nIndigent Criminal Defendants When Excessive \nCaseloads Interfere With Competent and Diligent Representation\nAll lawyers, including public defenders and other lawyers who, under\ncourt appointment or government contract, represent indigent persons\ncharged with criminal offenses, must provide competent and diligent\nrepresentation.  If workload prevents a lawyer from providing compe-\ntent and diligent representation to existing clients, she must not accept\nnew clients.  If the clients are being assigned through a court appoint-\nment system, the lawyer should request that the court not make any new\nappointments.  Once the lawyer is representing a client, the lawyer must\nmove to withdraw from representation if she cannot provide competent\nand diligent representation.  If the court denies the lawyer’s motion to\nwithdraw, and any available means of appealing such ruling is unsuc-\ncessful, the lawyer must continue with the representation while taking\nwhatever steps are feasible to ensure that she will be able to competent-\nly and diligently represent the defendant.\nLawyer supervisors, including heads of public defenders’ offices and\nthose within such offices having intermediate managerial responsibili-\nties, must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyers in the\noffice conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.

Excessive workloads present issues for both those who\nrepresent indigent defendants and the lawyers who supervise them.2\nEthical responsibilities of a public defender3 in regard to individual\nworkload\nPersons charged with crimes have a constitutional right to the effective assis-\ntance of counsel.4 Generally, if a person charged with a crime is unable to\nafford a lawyer, he is constitutionally entitled to have a lawyer appointed to rep-\nresent him.5 The states have attempted to satisfy this constitutional mandate\nthrough various methods, such as establishment of public defender, court\nappointment, and contract systems.6 Because these systems have been created\nto provide representation for a virtually unlimited number of indigent criminal\ndefendants, the lawyers employed to provide representation generally are limit-\ned in their ability to control the number of clients they are assigned. Measures\nhave been adopted in some jurisdictions in attempts to control workloads,7\nincluding the establishment of procedures for assigning cases to lawyers outside\npublic defenders’ offices when the cases could not properly be directed to a\npublic defender, either because of a conflict of interest or for other reasons.\n2.For additional discussion of the problems presented by excessive caseloads for pub-\nlic defenders, see “Gideon’s Broken Promise: American’s Continuing Quest For Equal\nJustice,” prepared by the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee on Legal Aid\nand Indigent Defendants 29 (ABA 2004), available at http://www.abanet.org/legalser-\nvices/sclaid/defender/brokenpromise/fullreport.pdf(last visited June 21, 2006).\n3.The term “public defender” as used here means both a lawyer employed in a pub-\nlic defender’s office and any other lawyer who represents, pursuant to court appoint-\nment or government contract, indigent persons charged with criminal offenses.\n4.U.S. CONST.amends.

National standards as to numerical caseload limits have been cited\nby the American Bar Association.11 Although such standards may be consid-\nered, they are not the sole factor in determining if a workload is excessive.\nSuch a determination depends not only on the number of cases, but also on\nsuch factors as case complexity, the availability of support services, the\nlawyer’s experience and ability, and the lawyer’s nonrepresentational duties.12\nIf a lawyer believes that her workload is such that she is unable to meet the\nbasic ethical obligations required of her in the representation of a client, she\nmust not continue the representation of that client or, if representation has not\nyet begun, she must decline the representation.13\nA lawyer’s primary ethical duty is owed to existing clients.14 Therefore, a\nand competent representation). See also South Carolina Bar Ethics Adv. Op. 04-12\n(Nov. 12, 2004) (all lawyers, including public defenders, have ethical obligation not to\nundertake caseload that leads to violation of professional conduct rules).\nThe applicability of Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4 to public defenders and/or prosecutors has\nbeen recognized by ethics advisory committees in at least one other state. SeeVa. Legal\nEth. Op. 1798 (Aug. 3, 2004) (duties of competence and diligence contained within rules\nof professional conduct apply equally to all lawyers, including prosecutors).\n10.Principle 5 of The Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery Systemspecifi-\ncally addresses the workload of criminal defense lawyers:\nDefense counsel’s workload is controlled to permit the rendering of quality rep-\nresentation. Counsel’s workload, including appointed and other work, should\nnever be so large as to interfere with the rendering of quality representation or\nlead to the breach of ethical obligations, and counsel is obligated to decline\nappointments above such levels. National caseload standards should in no event\nbe exceeded, but the concept of workload (i.e., caseload adjusted by factors such\nas case complexity, support services, and an attorney’s nonrepresentational\nduties) is a more accurate measurement.\nReport to the ABA House of Delegates No. 107 (adopted Feb. 5, 2002),available\nat http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/downloads/sclaid/10principles.pdf(last visited\nJune 21, 2006) (emphasis in original).\n11.Id.\n12.

See ABA Formal Opinion Op. 96-399 (Jan. 18, 1996) (Ethical Obligations of\nLawyers Whose Employers Receive Funds from the Legal Services Corporation to\ntheir Existing and Future Clients When Such Funding is Reduced and When Remaining\nFunding is Subject to Restrictive Conditions), in FORMAL AND INFORMAL ETHICS OPIN-\nIONS1983-1998 at369 (ABA 2000);ABA Formal Opinion Op. 347, supranote 9.\n\n5Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility 06-441\nlawyer must decline to accept new cases, rather than withdraw from existing\ncases, if the acceptance of a new case will result in her workload becoming\nexcessive. When an existing workload does become excessive, the lawyer\nmust reduce it to the extent that what remains to be done can be handled in\nfull compliance with the Rules.\nWhen a lawyer receives appointments directly from the court rather than as\na member of a public defender’s office or law firm that receives the appoint-\nment, she should take appropriate action if she believes that her workload will\nbecome, or already is, excessive. Such action may include the following:\n• requesting that the court refrain from assigning the lawyer any new cases until\nsuch time as the lawyer’s existing caseload has been reduced to a level that she\nis able to accept new cases and provide competent legal representation; and\n• if the excessive workload cannot be resolved simply through the court’s not\nassigning new cases, the lawyer should file a motion with the trial court request-\ning permission to withdraw from a sufficient number of cases to allow the pro-\nvision of competent and diligent representation to the remaining clients.15\nIf the lawyer has sought court permission to withdraw from the representa-\ntion and that permission has been denied, the lawyer must take all feasible\nsteps to assure that the client receives competent representation.\nWhen a lawyer receives appointments as a member of a public defender’s\noffice or law firm, the appropriate action to be taken by the lawyer to reduce an\nexcessive workload might include, with approval of the lawyer’s supervisor:\n• transferring non-representational responsibilities within the office, includ-\ning managerial responsibilities, to others;\n• refusing new cases;16 and\n• transferring current case(s) to another lawyer whose workload will allow\nfor the transfer of the case(s).17\n15. Whenever a lawyer seeks to withdraw from a representation the client should\nbe notified, even if court rules do not require such notification. SeeRule 1.4.\n16. It should be noted that a public defender’s attempt to avoid appointment or to\nwithdraw from a case must be based on valid legal grounds. Rule 6.2(a) provides, in per-\ntinent part, that “[a] lawyer shall not seek to avoidappointment by a tribunal to represent\naperson except for good cause,such as representing the client is likely to result in viola-\ntion of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.” (Emphasis added). Therefore, a\npublic defender should not claim an excessive workload in an attempt to avoid new\ncases or to withdraw from current cases unless good cause objectively exists.\n17.It is important to note that, for purposes of the Model Rules, a public defender’s\noffice, much like a legal services office, is considered to be the equivalent of a law firm.\nSeeRule 1.0(c). Unless a court specifically names an individual lawyer within a public\ndefender’s office to represent an indigent defendant, the public defender’s office should\nbe considered as a firm assigned to represent the client; responsibility for handling the\ncase falls upon the office as a whole. SeeABA Informal Op. 1428, supranote 9 (legal\nservices agency should be considered firm retained by client; responsibility for handling\ncaseload of departing legal services lawyer falls upon office as whole rather than upon\nlawyer who is departing). Therefore, cases may ethically be reassigned within a public\ndefender’s office. \n\n06-441 Formal Opinion 6\nIf the supervisor fails to provide appropriate assistance or relief, the lawyer\nshould continue to advance up the chain of command within the office until\neither relief is obtained or the lawyer has reached and requested assistance or\nrelief from the head of the public defender’s office.\nIn presenting these options, the Committee recognizes that whether a pub-\nlic defender’s workload is excessive often is a difficult judgment requiring\nevaluation of factors such as the complexity of the lawyer’s cases and other\nfactors.18 When a public defender consults her supervisor and the supervisor\nmakes a conscientious effort to deal with workload issues, the supervisor’s\nresolution ordinarily will constitute a “reasonable resolution of an arguable\nquestion of professional duty” as discussed in Rule 5.2(b).19 In those cases\nwhere the supervisor’s resolution is not reasonable, however, the public\ndefender must take further action.20\nSuch further action might include:\n• if relief is not obtained from the head of the public defender’s office, appeal-\ning to the governing board, if any, of the public defender’s office;21and\n• if the lawyer is still not able to obtain relief,22filing a motion with the trial\ncourt requesting permission to withdraw from a sufficient number of cases\nto allow the provision of competent and diligent representation to the\nremaining clients.23\nIf the public defender is not allowed to withdraw from representation, she\nmust obey the court’s order while taking all steps reasonably feasible to\ninsure that her client receives competent and diligent representation.24\n18.Seenote 12, supra,and accompanying text.\n19.SeeComment [2].\n20.See, e.g., Atty.

A public defender filing a motion to withdraw under these circumstances\nshould provide the court with information necessary to justify the withdrawal, while\nbeing mindful of the obligations not to disclose confidential information or informa-\ntion as to strategy or other matters that may prejudice the client. SeeRule 1.16 cmt. 3.\n24.Notwithstanding the lawyer’s duty in this circumstance to continue in the repre-\nsentation and to make every attempt to render the client competent representation, the\nlawyer nevertheless may pursue any available means of review of the court’s order. See\nIowa Supreme Court Bd. of Prof. Ethics & Conduct v. Hughes, 557 N.W.2d 890, 894\n\n7Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility 06-441\nEthical responsibility of a lawyer who supervises a public defender\nRule 5.1 provides that lawyers who have managerial authority, including\nthose with intermediate managerial responsibilities, over the professional\nwork of a firm or public sector legal agency or department shall make reason-\nable efforts to ensure that the other lawyers in the agency or department con-\nform to the Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 5.1 requires that lawyers\nhaving direct supervisory authority take reasonable steps to ensure that\nlawyers in the office they supervise are acting diligently in regard to all legal\nmatters entrusted to them, communicating appropriately with the clients on\nwhose cases they are working, and providing competent representation to\ntheir clients. As an essential first step, the supervisor must monitor the work-\nloads of subordinate lawyers to ensure that the workload of each lawyer is\nappropriate. This involves consideration of the type and complexity of cases\nbeing handled by each lawyer; the experience and ability of each lawyer; the\nresources available to support her, and any non-representational responsibili-\nties assigned to the subordinate lawyers. \nIf any subordinate lawyer’s workload is found to be excessive, the supervi-\nsor should take whatever additional steps are necessary to ensure that the sub-\nordinate lawyer is able to meet her ethical obligations in regard to the repre-\nsentation of her clients. These might include the following:\n• transferring the lawyer’s non-representational responsibilities, including\nmanagerial responsibilities, to others in the office;\n• transferring case(s) to another lawyer or other lawyers whose workload\nwill allow them to provide competent representation;25\n• if there are no other lawyers within the office who can take over the cases\nfrom which the individual lawyer needs to withdraw, supporting the lawyer’s\nefforts to withdraw from the representation of the client;26and finally,\n• if the court will not allow the lawyer to withdraw from representation, pro-\nviding the lawyer with whatever additional resources can be made avail-\nable to assist her in continuing to represent the client(s) in a manner consis-\ntent with the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n(Iowa 1996) (“ignoring a court order is simply not an appropriate step to test the validi-\nty of the order under our Code of Professional Responsibility”); Utah Bar Eth. Adv.\nOp. 107 (Feb. 15, 1992) (if grounds exist to decline court appointment, lawyer should\nnot disobey order but should seek review by appeal or other available procedure).\n25.See note 17, supra.\n26. See In re Order on Prosecution of Criminal Appeals by Tenth Judicial Circuit\nPublic Defender, 561 So.2d 1130, 1138-39 (Fla. 1990) (in context of inadequate fund-\ning, court stated that if “the backlog of cases in the public defender’s office is so\nexcessive that there is no possible way he can timely handle those cases, it is his\nresponsibility to move the court to withdraw”); see also In re Order on Motions to\nWithdraw Filed by Tenth Circuit Public Defender, 612 So.2d 597 (Fla. App. 1992) (en\nbanc) (public defender’s office entitled to withdraw due to excessive caseload from\nrepresenting defendants in one hundred forty-three cases).\n\n06-441 Formal Opinion 8\nWhen a supervised lawyer’s workload is excessive and, notwithstanding any\nother efforts made by her supervisor to address the problem, it is obviously\nincumbent upon the supervisor to assign no additional cases to the lawyer, and,\nifthe lawyer’s cases come by assignment from the court, to support the lawyer’s\nefforts to have no new cases assigned to her by the court until such time as she\ncan adequately fulfill her ethical responsibilities to her existing clients.\nIn dealing with workload issues, supervisors frequently must balance compet-\ning demands for scarce resources. As Comment [2] to Rule 5.2 observes, if the\nquestion of whether a lawyer’s workload is too great is “reasonably arguable,” the\nsupervisor of the lawyer has the authority to decide the question. In the final\nanalysis, however, each client is entitled to competent and diligent representation.\nIf a supervisor knows that a subordinate’s workload renders the lawyer unable to\nprovide competent and diligent representation and the supervisor fails to take rea-\nsonable remedial action, under Rule 5.1(c),27the supervisor himself is responsible\nfor the subordinate’s violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.28\n27.Rule 5.1(c) states:\n(c) A lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer’s violation of the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct if: (1) the lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific\nconduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or (2) the lawyer is a partner or has compa-\nrable managerial authority in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, or\nhas direct supervisory authority over the other lawyer, and knows of the conduct at\natime when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reason-\nable remedial action.\nSee alsoRules 1.16 (a) and 8.4 (a).\n28.See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm'n of Maryland v. Ficker, 706 A.2d at 1052,\nsupranote 12); Va.

E-91-3 (1991) (assigning caseload that\nexceeds recognized maximum caseload standards, and that would not allow subordinate\npublic defender to conform to rules of professional conduct, \"could result in a violation of\ndisciplinary standards\"); Ariz. Op. No. 90-10 (Sept. 17, 1990) (“when a Public Defender\nhas knowledge that subordinate lawyers, because of their caseloads, cannot comply with\ntheir duties of diligence and competence, the Public Defender must take action.”);\nWisconsin State Bar Prof. Ethics Comm. Op. E-84-11 (1984) (supervisors in public\ndefender’s office may not ethically increase workloads of subordinate lawyers to point\nwhere subordinate lawyer cannot, even at personal sacrifice, handle each of her clients’\nmatters competently and in non-neglectful manner). \n\n9Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility 06-441\nConclusion\nThe obligations of competence, diligence, and communication under the\nRules apply equally to every lawyer. All lawyers, including public defenders,\nhave an ethical obligation to control their workloads so that every matter they\nundertake will be handled competently and diligently. If a lawyer’s workload\nis such that the lawyer is unable to provide competent and diligent representa-\ntion to existing or potential clients, the lawyer should not accept new clients.\nIf the problem of an excessive workload cannot be resolved through the non-\nacceptance of new clients or by other available measures, the lawyer should\nmove to withdraw as counsel in existing cases to the extent necessary to bring\nthe workload down to a manageable level, while at all times attempting to\nlimit the prejudice to any client from whose case the lawyer has withdrawn. If\npermission of a court is required to withdraw from representation and permis-\nsion is refused, the lawyer’s obligations under the Rules remain: the lawyer\nmust continue with the representation while taking whatever steps are feasible\nto ensure that she will be able to provide competent and diligent representa-\ntion to the defendant.\nSupervisors, including the head of a public defender’s office and those\nwithin such an office having intermediate managerial responsibilities, must\nmake reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyers in the office conform\nto the Rules of Professional Conduct.To that end, supervisors must, working\nwith the lawyers they supervise, monitor the workload of the subordinate\nlawyers to ensure that the workloads are not allowed to exceed that which\nmay be handled by the individual lawyers. If a supervisor knows that a subor-\ndinate’s workload renders the lawyer unable to provide competent and dili-\ngent representation and the supervisor fails to take reasonable remedial\naction, the supervisor is responsible for the subordinate’s violation of the\nRules of Professional Conduct.",

Plaintiff is the Chief Public Defender of Luzerne County, and has been since \nMay 2010.  He has repeatedly, but fruitlessly, petitioned Defendant County \nfor additional resources for the OPD and warned that the OPD attorneys are \n \n  1 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 3    Filed 04/10/12   Page 2 of 7\nso overworked that they cannot properly represent all of the indigent criminal \ndefendants in Luzerne County.   \n3.  Beginning in December 2011, Plaintiff Flora informed the Court of Common \nPleas that the OPD would decline appointments in most new criminal cases \n(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:51)(cid:39)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:84)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)\nrepresentation.   The OPD currently approves new applications for \nrepresentation only from indigent adult defendants with homicide or felony \nsex offense charges, or individuals who are incarcerated or subject to \nextradition.  The OPD also continues to provide representation to individuals \nin mental health, state parole, county probation/parole revocation, and \njuvenile cases.  The OPD has continued representation in all cases that the \nOPD was handling before December 19, 2011. \n4.

Plaintiff incorporates by reference the facts alleged in the Verified \nComplaint. \n8.  Plaintiff also incorporates herein by reference the legal arguments contained \nin the Memorandum in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  \nPlaintiff has satisfied the four-part test for granting a preliminary injunction. \n9.  As is more fully set forth in the accompanying legal memorandum, Plaintiff \nis are likely to prevail on the merits of his claims (cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:92)(cid:79)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)\nWrongful Discharge tort and the First Amendment. \n10.  Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm unless the requested injunctive relief is \ngranted.  \n11.  Since the Defendant are a political subdivision and its agent, they have no \nlegally-cognizable interest in violating the public policy of the \nCommonwealth or in suppressing constitutionally-protected speech and \npetition.  \n12.  Granting Plaintiff the requested preliminary relief will not result in any \nforeseeable harm to Defendants or the public. \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 3    Filed 04/10/12   Page 4 of 7\n13.  Plaintiff, through undersigned counsel, gave notice to Vito DeLuca, the \nacting Solicitor for Luzerne County, on April 10, 2012, that Plaintiff would \nbe filing this action and seeking preliminary injunctive relief.   \n14.  This being a non-commercial case involving a relatively small amount of \nmoney, and the balance of hardships favoring the Plaintiff, the Fed. R.

Plaintiff Is Likely To Succeed On The Claim That His Discharge \nWould Be Unlawful Retaliation For Exercising His First Amendment \nRights To Speak And To Petition The Government \n \nAs the Supreme Court has consistently held, the First Amendment protects a \npublic employee(cid:182)s right to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.  \nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 417 (2006).  Indeed, the importance of \npromoting the public(cid:182)s interest in receiving the well-informed views of \ngovernment employees, is such that the First Amendment interests at stake extend \nbeyond the individual speaker.  Id. at 419.  These First Amendment interests \n(cid:179)limit[] the ability of a public employer to leverage the employment relationship to \nrestrict, incidentally or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their \ncapacities as private citizens.(cid:180)  Id.  Accordingly, when the government acts as \nemployer, it violates its employees(cid:182) free-speech rights if it takes adverse action \nagainst an employee in retaliation for that employee(cid:182)s protected speech.  See, e.g., \nPro v. Donatucci, 81 F.3d 1283, 1288 (3d Cir. 1996). \nA public employee(cid:182)s speech is protected by the First Amendment only if the \nemployee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern and the government \nemployer did not have (cid:179)an adequate justification for treating the employee \ndifferently from any other member of the general public(cid:180) as a result of his \n13 \n  \n\n!aaassseee      333:::111222-­-­-cccvvv-­-­-000000666666555-­-­-AAARRR!                  DDDooocccuuummmeeennnttt      444                  FFFiiillleeeddd      000444///111000///111222                  PPPaaagggeee      111999      ooofff      222999\nstatements.  Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 418.2  See also Hill v. Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225, \n241-42 (3d Cir. 2006) ((cid:179)A public employee(cid:182)s statement is protected activity when \n(1) in making it, the employee spoke as a citizen, (2) the statement involved a \nmatter of public concern, and (3) the government employer did not have an \nadequate justification for treating the employee differently from (cid:181)any other \nmember of the general public(cid:182) as a result of the statement he made.(cid:180)) (quoting \nGarcetti, 547 U.S. at 421).  In addition to satisfying these requirements, a public \nemployee must show that the protected activity was a substantial or motivating \nfactor in the alleged retaliatory action.  Pro, 81 F.3d at 1288.   \n                                                                                                                      \n2     The Supreme Court recently held that claims of retaliation for the filing of a \n(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:88)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:92)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)framework \nused to govern Speech Clause claims by public employees, when applied to the \nPetition Clause, will protect both the interests of the government and the First \nAmendment right. If a public employee petitions as an employee on a matter of \npurely private concern, the employee(cid:182)s First Amendment interest must give way, \nas it does in speech cases. City of San Diego v. Roe, 543 U.S. 77, at 82(cid:177)83, 125 \nS.Ct. 521 (2004) (per curiam). When a public employee petitions as a citizen on a \nmatter of public concern, the employee(cid:182)s First Amendment interest must be \nbalanced against the countervailing interest of the government in the effective and \nefficient management of its internal affairs.  Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. \n563, 568, supra, at 568, 88 S. Ct. 1731 (1968).  If that balance favors the public \nemployee, the employee(cid:182)s First Amendment claim will be sustained. If the \ninterference with the government(cid:182)s operations is such that the balance favors the \nemployer, the employee(cid:182)s First Amendment claim will fail even though the \npetition is on a matter of public concern.(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:3)Borough of Duryea v.

The Court explained that: \nRestricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee(cid:182)s \nprofessional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the \nemployee might have enjoyed as a private citizen. It simply reflects \nthe exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has \ncommissioned or created. . . .

The only thing that has changed about Plaintiff Flora is that he has \nsued the County for the resources he needs to operate the OPD in accordance with \nconstitutional strictures.  And that is the reason the Interim County Manager \nthreatened to fire him. \nThe burden, therefore, shifts to the Defendants to (cid:179)establish that [they] \nwould have taken the adverse employment action regardless of whether the \nemployee had engaged in the protected conduct.(cid:180)  Pro, 81 F.3d at 1288; see also \nO(cid:182)Donnell, 875 F.2d at 1060-61 (in a public-employee speech case, government \n(cid:179)bears the burden of justifying the [disciplinary action](cid:180)).

Today, plaintiff is filing a mandamus action \nin state comi against the County seeking to compel the County to increase \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 2 of 22\nresources for the Public Defender.  Plaintiff has reason to believe that this legal \naction will subject him to retaliatory termination by the County. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This COUli has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343(3) and (4).  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state \ntOli claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. DeclaratOlY relief is authorized by 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57.  Injunctive relief is \nauthorized by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. \n2.  This COUli has personal jurisdiction over the defendants, who are \nlocated in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. \n3.  Venue is proper in the Middle District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 \nU.S.c. § 1391(a) in that the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction within \nthe Middle District of Pennsylvania and the events that give rise to this action \noccurred within the Middle District of Pennsylvania. \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff Al Flora, Jr. has been the Chief Public Defender in the Office \nof the Public Defender (\"OPD\") of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania since May 2010. \nAs Chief Public Defender, Plaintiff Flora is responsible for managing the OPD, \nwhich includes overseeing its lawyers and employees, establishing its policies, \n2 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 3 of 22\nmanaging its budget, and ensuring its compliance with constitutional, statutory, \nand professional/ethical guidelines. \n5.  Defendant Luzerne County is a county of the Third Class located in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania.  Effective January 2, 2012, the County transitioned to \nHome Rule under the governance of the present Council.  Prior to January 2012, \nthe County had an elected Board of County Commissioners (\"the \nCommissioners\"). \n6.  Defendant Robert C. Lawton is the County Manager of Luzerne \nCounty, Pennsylvania.  The County Manager maintains an office at 200 North \nRiver Street, Wilkes-Barre, P A  18711.  Defendant Lawton assumed this position \non February 29, 2012.  He is sued in his official capacity.  At all times hereinafter \nmentioned, these defendants were acting within the scope of their official duties \nand under color of state law. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n7.  The Pennsylvania Public Defender Act (\"Act\") requires each County \nto appoint a public defender, who is directed to provide legal representation to, \ninter alia, indigent criminal defendants, juveniles charged with delinquency and \npeople subject to involuntary commitment.  16 P.S. §§ 9960.3, 9960.6. \n8.  The right to counsel anchors oUl' criminal justice system: \"Without \ncounsel, the right to a trial itself would be (of little avail'. . . .  (Of all the rights that \n3 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 4 of 22\nan accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most \npervasive for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have. \",  United \nStates v.  Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 653-54 (1984) (citing Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. \n45, 68-69 (1932). \n9.  Plaintiff Flora is the Chief Public Defender in Luzerne County, \nPennsylvania.  He has been with the OPD as an attorney since 1980. He became \nthe First Assistant Public Defender in 1990 and the acting Chief Public Defender in \nMarch 2010.  In May 2010, he was appointed the Chief Public Defender by the \nLuzerne County Board of Commissioners. \n10.  The OPD is divided into two units: the Adult Unit and the Juvenile \nUnit.  Plaintiff Flora oversees both units. \n11.  The OPD is charged with providing representation to indigent \ncriminal defendants in seventeen magisterial districts, the Luzerne County Court of \nCommon Pleas, and the state appellate courts (as needed).  The OPD is also \nresponsible for providing representation in state parole, county probation/parole \nrevocation, juvenile delinquency, and mental health civil commitment proceedings. \nPlaintiff Flora's Efforts to Improve the OPD \n12.  When Plaintiff Flora became Chief Public Defender in May 2010, the \nOPD was already plagued with problems due to years of insufficient funding. \nPlaintiff Flora's predecessor, Basil Russin, had tried in vain since 2007 to secure \n4 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 5 of 22\nadditional funding for the OPD from the County.  From 2007 to 2010, Mr. Russin \nsubmitted weekly reports to the Luzerne County Board of Commissioners detailing \nthe excessive OPD caseloads and staffing deficiencies, which stemmed from \ninsufficient funding.  The repolis also discussed the County's failure to fill \nvacancies in a timely fashion. \n13.  Plaintiff Flora's highest priority when he became Chief Public \nDefender was improving juvenile representation in the wake of the so-called \"kids \nfor cash\" scandal, in which two judges of the Luzerne County COUlt of Common \nPleas were convicted or pled guilty to charges that they improperly accepted \nmoney from two private, for-profit juvenile detention facilities. \n14.  State records reveal that between 2003 and 2008, the time period \nduring which the \"kids for cash\" scandal occurred, approximately 50 percent of \njuveniles appeared in Luzerne County Juvenile Court without the benefit of \ncounsel-nearly ten times the state average.  Virtually all ofthe unrepresented \njuveniles were adjudicated delinquent.  According to the December 2011 report by \nJoint State Government Commission's Task Force and Advisory COllUnittee on \nServices to Indigent Criminal Defendants, the OPD was unable to provide effective \nrepresentation to juveniles during this time because of inadequate resources. \n15.  As pati of his effOlis to improve the quality of juvenile representation, \nPlaintiff Flora was able to obtain grant funding from the Pennsylvania Commission \n5 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 6 of 22\non Crime and Delinquency and the Luzerne-Wyoming Counties Mental \nHealthlMental Retardation Program.  These grants allowed Plaintiff Flora to create \na separate Juvenile Unit by hiring one attorney, two social workers, one secretary, \nand one investigator to exclusively handle juvenile cases. \n16.  Even with this grant funding, Plaintiff Flora was forced also to \ntransfer a senior attorney from the Adult Unit to meet the staffing needs in the \nJuvenile Unit.  Defendants have refused to authorize Plaintiff Flora to replace this \nattorney in the Adult Unit, despite the fact that funding for the position exists in the \ncurrent budget. \n17.  With a full complement of staff in the Juvenile Unit, Plaintiff Flora \nhas been able to implement a comprehensive process for handling juvenile cases \nand determining juvenile eligibility for OPD representation.  The Juvenile Unit is \nnow a model unit that has earned accolades from across the state and has been \nrecognized by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency as a \n\"Model\" Juvenile Defender Unit for the state. The senior attorney in the Juvenile \nUnit is a member of the Board of Directors of the Juvenile Defenders Association \nof Pennsylvania (\"JDAP\").  The Juvenile Unit adheres to JDAP's Performance \nGuidelines for Quality and Effective Juvenile Delinquency Representation.  With \nthe resources provided by outside grant funding and the County, the OPD has been \nable to intervene in juvenile cases at an early stage, thereby divelting these cases \n6 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 7 of 22\nfrom court and preserving the resources of the Juvenile Unit, the County, and the \njudiciary. \n18.  Despite the success of the Juvenile Unit, the County has refused to \nprovide Plaintiff Flora with the resources necessary to make similar and badly \nneeded improvements to the Adult Unit. \n19.  In June 2010, Plaintiff Flora provided Defendant County and its \nCommissioners with a rep0l1 describing the significant resource shortfall at the \nOPD and its consequent inability to provide the representation required by the \nPublic Defender Act and the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions.  The OPD's \nlisted deficiencies included: \na.  Caseloads for OPD attorneys that far exceed national maximum \ncaseload standards; \nb.  An insufficient number of clerical staff; \nc.  The County's failure to fill staff vacancies; \nd.  The lack of any appellate counsel, reSUlting in stafflawyers, \nmany of whom are not versed or trained in appellate practice, \ndoing their own appeals; \ne.  Physical facilities that are undersized, overcrowded, poorly \nmaintained and not suitable for client conferences or \nmaintaining client confidentiality; and \nf.  Severely inadequate information technology. \n20.  At the conclusion of his rep0l1, Plaintiff Flora stated, \"[a]bsent \nappropriate staff increases, the Office will begin declining applications for \n7 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 8 of 22\nrepresentation within 60 days.\"  Plaintiff Flora's June 2010 report is attached to \nthis Complaint as Exhibit A. \n21.  Plaintiff Flora discussed his June 2010 repOli at a meeting with the \nCounty Commissioners soon thereafter.  The Commissioners were unhappy with \nMr. Flora's report, several of them calling it \"demeaning.\" \n22.  In July 2010, at the request of the Commissioners, Plaintiff Flora \nprovided Defendant County and its Commissioners with a short-term plan to \ncorrect the OPD's staffing deficiencies and the resulting problems. \nRecommendations included the creation of a Juvenile Unit, hiring appellate and \nadditional trial attorneys, and active caseload monitoring.  Plaintiff Flora's July \n2010 plan is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit B. \n23.  In his 2011 budget proposal, Plaintiff Flora recommended hiring two \nattorneys to handle appeals because the trial attorneys, who had (and still have) \nlittle to no appellate experience, were responsible for their own appeals.  He also \nrequested an additional investigator and a secretary \"to help alleviate \nstaffing/caseload problems and provide better ratio oflawyers to support staff to \ninsure effective assistance of counsel.\"  The County denied his requests. \n24.  Plaintiff Flora's 2012 budget again requested two appellate lawyers, \nalong with two secretaries, to start rectifying the severe staffing shortage in the \nOffice. \n8 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 9 of 22\nCurrently office has no appellate lawyers creating significant \nethical issues for supervisory counsel.  Two appellate lawyers \nwould bring office into compliance with ABA standards on \nPublic Defense Delivery Systems as relating to appeals.  Office \nstill understaffed on adult side re: trial lawyers and does not \nmeet ABA standards.  Two additional secretaries seriously \nneeded on adult side given large volume of cases.  Currently, \noffice has 4 clerk steno's on adult side with each steno handling \nover 1,000 cases per year.  Adequate support staff essential to \nallow counsel to [s ic] perform duties effectively. \nDefendants once more denied Plaintiff Flora's requests .. \n25.  Because of Defendants' refusal to provide minimum funding and \nresources to the OPD, Plaintiff Flora was forced to take action to limit caseloads in \norder to provide constitutionally adequate criminal defense to at least some \nindigent defendants in Luzerne County. \nThe Public Defender's Office Has Been Forced To Decline Cases In Order To \nComply With Ethical Rules And Professional Standards \n26.  On December 12,2011, Plaintiff Flora sent a letter to the President \nJudge of the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas stating that he would begin \ndeclining certain cases on December 19, 2011, because of a lack of OPD resources. \n27.  Beginning on December 19th, the OPD started declining cases, \nadvising defendants in writing that although they were eligible for counsel, the \nOPD could not accommodate their request due to a lack of resources.  The OPD \ncurrently approves new applications for representation only from indigent adult \ndefendants with homicide or felony sex offense charges, or individuals who are \n9 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 10 of 22\nincarcerated or subject to extradition.  The OPD also continues to provide \nrepresentation to individuals in mental health, state parole, county probation/parole \nrevocation, and juvenile cases.  The OPD has continued representation in all cases \nthat the OPD was handling before December 19, 2011. \n28.  To date, the Office has declined representation to over three hundred \n(300) eligible criminal defendants. \n29.  To date, conflict counsel have not been appointed to represent \ndefendants whom the OPD has declined to represent as a result of the December \n19,2011 policy.  Upon information and belief, the Court of Common Pleas does \nnot have sufficient resources to provide conflict counsel for so many defendants. \n30.  Plaintiff Flora's policy to limit new cases to address excessive \nworkloads is neceSSaIY in light of the ethical and constitutional rules under which \nPlaintiff Flora and the OPD operate.  His policy is required by the Pennsylvania \nRules of Professional Conduct and the ethical guidance provided to public \ndefenders by the American Bar Association and the National Legal Aid and \nDefender Association.! \n31.  Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 states that \"[a] lawyer \nshall provide competent representation to a client.  Competent representation \nThe American Bar Association's Ten Principles ofa  Public Defense Delivery \nI \nSystem is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit C.  The NLADA Guidelines are \nattached to this Complaint as Exhibit D. \n10 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 11 of 22\nrequires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably \nnecessary for the representation.\"  Plaintiff Flora's policy is necessary to ensure \nthat OPD attorneys' caseloads are not so overwhelming that they preclude the \nattorneys from providing clients with representation involving sufficient \npreparation and thoroughness to satisfy the requirements of Rule 1.1. \n32.  Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 5.1 states that \"[a] lawyer \nhaving direct supervisory authority over another lawyer shall make reasonable \nefforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional \nConduct.\"  Plaintiff Flora's policy is necessary to ensure that the OPD attorneys \nover whom Plaintiff Flora has supervisory authority comply with Rule 1.1. \n33.  American Bar Association Ethics Opinion 06-4412 states that the \nRules of Professional Conduct relating to competency \"provide no exception for \nlawyers who represent indigent persons charged with crimes.\"  American Bar \nAssociation Ethics Opinion 06-441 also provides that \"[a] lawyer's primary ethical \nduty is owed to existing clients.  Therefore, a lawyer must decline to accept new \ncases, rather than withdraw from existing cases, if the acceptance of a new case \nwill result in her workload becoming excessive.\" \n34.  American Bar Association Ethics Opinion 06-44l further states that \n\"[i]f any subordinate lawyer's workload is found to be excessive, the supervisor \nThe American Bar Association's Ethics Opinion 06-441 is attached hereto as \n2 \nExhibit E. \n11 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 12 of 22\nshould take whatever additional steps are necessary to ensure that the subordinate \nlawyer is able to meet her ethical obligations in regard to the representation of her \nclients.\" \n35.  On February 28, 2012, Plaintiff Flora sent a letter to the President \nJudge of the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas requesting \"the court's \nimmediate assistance ... to assign outside or conflict counsel to provide \nrepresentation in [mental health] cases.\"  The part-time attorney who handled \nmental health cases resigned on February 20, 2012, and another attorney, largely \nuntrained in mental health law, has been temporarily assigned to these cases.  This \nis one of the four funded vacancies that Plaintiff Flora is seeking to fill. \n36.  On March 16, 2012, one of the OPD's palt-time attorneys advised \nPlaintiff Flora that he would no longer accept cases that had been reassigned due to \ncurrent or upcoming vacancies.  The attorney stated that he could not provide \nethical representation to indigent defendants ifhe added more cases to his already \nheavy workload.  Even with the December 19, 2011, policy in effect for three \nmonths, this part-time attorney had approximately 115 open cases as of March 16, \n2012. \nThe County Has FUither Decreased Funding For The Public Defender's \nOffice Since That Office Began Declining Cases \n37.  In January 2012, Luzerne County reopened its budget pursuant to its \ntransition to Home Rule.  The Interim County Manager gave all county offices a \n12 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 13 of 22\nbottom-line figure within which to allocate their funding.  The OPD was given \n$2.36 million, a nearly twelve percent (12%) decrease from its $2.68 million 2011 \nbudget.  The loss in funds would have required the OPD to cut four positions, \njeopardizing the adequate staffing in the Juvenile Unit as some of its employees \nwould have had to be shifted to the Adult Unit. \n38.  After the Council approved a two-percent tax increase, Plaintiff Flora \nwas able rearrange his new allotment of$2.5 million (a 6.7% decrease from 2011) \nto maintain current staffing levels.  Preserving existing positions in the OPD \nrequired Plaintiff Flora to reduce his expert witness budget from $100,000 to \n$72,000.  (The OPD spent approximately $170,000 on expert witnesses in 2011.) \nThis budget reduction will have a substantial impact on the OPD's ability to retain \nexperts in capital and juvenile cases, both of which frequently require expelt \ntestimony.  The OPD will likely have to petition the Court to direct the County to \npay expelt fees once the OPD has exceeded its budget for this expense. \n39.  Plaintiff Flora submitted his new budget under protest, declaring \nCurrent staffing levels and existing caseloads, prevent this office \nfi'om providing level of representation required by ethical \nstandards and by Federal and State Constitutions.  As such, \noffice is ethically required to withdraw from existing cases or \nrefuse new cases.  Letter ofJanuary 3, 2012 from American \nCouncil of Chief Defenders to County Council supports \nposition.

In February 2012, the Interim Manager permitted Plaintiff Flora to \nadvertise the three funded attorney vacancies in the Adult Unit.3  As the County \nhad instituted a hiring freeze in February 2012, the Interim Manager did not allow \nPlaintiff Flora to fill these vacancies. \n41.  Defendant Lawton, the new County Manager, has also not permitted \nPlaintiff Flora to fill these vacancies. \nCurrent State of the Luzerne County Public Defender's Office \n42.  National standards and Rules of Professional Responsibility define \nproper legal representation to indigent criminal defendants at all critical stages of \nthe proceedings against them as requiring, among other things, that defense \ncounsel: (a) have adequate knowledge of the relevant areas of the law; (b) be \nassigned to their clients as early in the criminal, delinquency, or mental health \nproceeding as possible; (c) be present at every critical stage of their cl ients' \nproceedings; (d) conduct reasonable factual and legal pre-trial investigations into \nthe charges against their clients, pursue available formal and informal discovery \nprocedures, and use appropriate and necessary experts; (e) consult with their \nclients to elicit relevant information about the case, to inform clients of their rights, \nThere are currently four funded vacancies due to the March 27,2012 resignation \n3 \nof a full-time attorney in the Adult Unit. \n14 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 15 of 22\nand to enable clients to make informed decisions about the direction of their cases; \nand (t) perform their work with reasonable diligence and promptness. \n43.  The NLADA Performance Guidelines require criminal defense \nattorneys, in part: \na.  To have \"sufficient time, resources, knowledge and experience to \noffer quality representation to a defendant in a patticular matter ... . \n[and] to keep the client informed of the progress of the case ....\"  \nGuideline 1.3. \nh.  To engage in an initial interview with their clients.  During this \ninterview, the attorney is expected to \"be familiar with the elements of \nthe offense and the potential punishment, where the charges against \nthe client are already known\" and to have obtained all available \nrelevant documents.  Guideline 2.2. \nc.  To appear at the arraignment.  Guideline 3.1. \nd.  To be familiar with the facts of the case prior to appearing at the \npreliminary hearing.  Guideline 3.2. \ne.  To promptly conduct an independent investigation of the facts of the \ncase, including interviewing witnesses and retaining experts, when \nnecessary.  Guideline 4.1. \nf.  To pursue formal and informal discovery as soon as practicable. \nGuideline 4.2. \ng.  To file a variety of pretrial motions, when appropriate.  Guidelines \n5.1-5.3. \nh.  To engage in comprehensive trial preparation.  Guideline 7.1. \n44.  OPD attorneys are currently unable to meet the NLADA Performance \nGuidelines due to the excessive workloads they face.  Indeed, the December 2011 \nrepOlt of the Joint State Government Commission's Task Force and Advisory \n[5 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 16 of 22\nCommittee on Services to Indigent Criminal Defendants indicated that the OPD is \noperating under excessive workloads and would require an additional 8.5 full-time \nattorneys to meet nationally recognized standards.  This number does not include \n4 \nthe four current, budgeted vacancies that Plaintiff Flora has not been authorized to \nfill. \n45.  Because Defendants have refused to provide the necessary funding \nand resources, the OPD cannot provide representation that satisfies the above \nstandards and therefore cannot provide legal representation to indigent criminal \ndefendants at all critical stages ofthe proceedings against them in accordance with \nits constitutional, statutory, and professional obligations.  In particular: \na.  OPD lawyers are frequently unable to interview or meet with their \nclients prior to a preliminary hearing and have no contact whatsoever \nwith their clients between court appearances; \nb.  OPD lawyers are often able to conduct no discovery or only minimal \ndiscovery; \nc.  OPD lawyers are often able to engage in no motion practice or only \nminimal motion practice; \nd.  OPD lawyers are unable to muster adequate information to engage in \neffective plea negotiations; \ne.  OPD lawyers are able to engage in only minimal trial preparation; and \nA Constitutional Default: Services To Indigent Criminal Defendants In \n4 \nPennsylvania, Report Of The Task Force And Advisory Committee On Services \nTo Indigent Criminal Defendants December 2011, is attached hereto as Exhibit F. \n16 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 17 of 22\nf.  OPD lawyers are required to conduct their own appeals despite \nlacking adequate training and resources to do so effectively, resulting \nin missed deadlines and dismissed appeals. \nThese deficiencies have only gotten worse as the OPD's resources have been \nreduced by defendants.  And, of course, since the OPD has begun declining new \ncases, there are hundreds of indigent defendants who have no representation at all \nin their ongoing criminal cases. \nPlaintiff Flora's Threats to Sue and The County's Threat to Retaliate \n46.  In December 2011, Mr. Flora spoke to local newspaper reporters \nabout his decision to decline new cases while the OPD's resources precluded \nadequate representation of new clients.  He stated, among other things, that he \nwould consider suing the County if there were no other way to obtain adequate \nfunding for the OPD.  Those comments were reported on December 20, 2011in a \nlocal newspaper, the Times Leader .. \n47.  A few weeks later, on January 8, 2012, Mr. Flora's willingness to sue \nthe County, if necessary, to obtain adequate funding for the office was again \nrepOlied by the Times Leader. \n48.  Mr. Flora's comments did not go unnoticed.  At a meeting about the \nproposed budget revision in late January 2012, the County's Interim Manager, \nThomas Pribula, in discussing the proposed cuts to all cOUli offices, stated that he \nbelieved that Plaintiff Flora would sue the County because the County would not \n17 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 18 of 22\naugment the OPD's budget.  He went on to note that the Public Defender is \nselected by the County Manager with County Council confirmation, and that they \ncould replace Mr. Flora ifthere was a \"lack of cooperation.\"s  Those remarks were \nreported in the Times Leader on January 27,2012. \n49.  Since learning of Mr. Pribula's \"lack of cooperation\" comment, Mr. \nFlora has refrained from making public comments regarding his concerns about the \nOPD's insufficient funding.  Prior to Mr. Pribula's statement, Mr. Flora would \nadvocate for the OPD without hesitation at public meetings and in the media, \nexplaining how the County's failure to adequately fund the OPD was \ncompromising the rights of indigent defendants.  He is now concerned that such \ncomments would cost him his job.  Mr. Flora currently does not speak at public \nmeetings and only provides cautiously worded statements to the media that do not \ncontain his professional opinions about OPD operations. \n50.  Plaintiff Flora is even more concerned that his lawsuit against the \nCounty, seeking greater funding for the OPD, will precipitate his removal from \noffice. \n51.  The threatened retaliation for speech and for Plaintiff Flora's efforts to \nfulfill his constitutional, statutory and professional responsibilities creates a \nAt the same meeting, Council member Edward Brominski, who had voted for the \nS \nmore austere amended budget with no tax increase, said, \"The DA, courts and \npublic defender - they don't intimidate me.\" \n18 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 19 of 22\nprofound chill on expression by Plaintiff Flora and others within the OPD, sending \na message that \"lack of cooperation\" with the County's budget choices - however \nthey affect the constitutional rights of criminal defendants - will be punished, \nthereby creating irreparable harm. \n52.  Moreover, if Plaintiff Flora is removed from office, he no longer will \nhave standing to pursue relief for the OPD and its clients, thus silencing the most \npowerful voice for the rights of Luzerne County criminal defendants.  There is no \nlegal remedy available to obviate this chill on free speech, a matter that has a \nsubstantial impact on the public's interest in having a Public Defender that is \nindependent and willing to advocate for the OPD's clients.  Expeditious injunctive \nrelief, under the circumstances of this case, is both necessary and appropriate. \nCLAIMS \n53.  The threatened termination of Plaintiff Flora would violate his rights \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as \nmade actionable against such defendants pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, \n42 U.S.c. § 1983.  Similarly, the threatened termination of Plaintiff Flora would \nconstitute Wrongful Discharge under Pennsylvania's tort law. \n54.  Plaintiff Flora is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent \nirreparable harm - the loss of his First Amendment rights - and to protect the \npublic's interest in knowing the facts about the OPD. \n19 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 1    Filed 04/10/12   Page 20 of 22\nREQUESTED RELIEF \nOn the basis of the foregoing, Plaintiff Al Flora, Jr. requests the following: \n(a)  The issuance of a temporary restraining order to prevent his removal \nfrom the position of Chief Public Defender for Luzerne County; \n(b)  The issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctions; \n(c)  an order awarding the Plaintiff the costs incurred in this litigation, \nincluding attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n(d)  such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Mary Catherine Roper \nMARY CATHERINE ROPER \nPA ID No. 71107 \nHILARY EMERSON \nPA ID No. 311823 \nAmerican Civil Libelties \nFoundation Of Pennsylvania \nP.O.

Ct. 2014) (attached asApp. B) (“And now . . . the order of the Luzerne\nCounty Court of Common Pleas, dated October 22, 2013, is hereby affirmed.”).\nThe Commonwealth Court deniedAppellants’Petition for Reargument on\nDecember 2, 2014, available at 2014 Pa.

In a matter of first impression, do appellants state a claim for\nconstructive denial of counsel under the Sixth and FourteenthAmendments to the\nUnited States Constitution, andArticle 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania\nConstitution, based on chronic and systemic deficiencies in the operation of\nLuzerne County‘s Office of the Public Defender that deprive them and the class\nthey seek to represent of their right to effective assistance of counsel?\n2. Do appellants state a claim of mandamus to compel appellees to\nprovide adequate funding for Luzerne County’s Office of the Public Defender, as\nrequired by the Commonwealth’s Public DefenderAct, 16 Pa. Stat. §§ 9960.1–\n9960.13 (hereinafter the \"Public DefenderAct\")?\nSTATEMENT OFTHE CASE\nI. Form of Action and Procedural History\nThis appeal arises from the Commonwealth Court’s affirmance of the\nLuzerne County Court of Common Pleas’ dismissal of a class action complaint that\nseeks to remedy violations of indigent defendants’ right to counsel guaranteed by\nthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by\nArticle 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In the alternative,\nAppellants seek a writ of mandamus that would compel Luzerne County to meet its\nstatutory obligation under the Public Defender Act “to provide adequate\nrepresentation” for clients of the County’s Office of the Public Defender (“OPD”).\n2\n\nOn April 10, 2012, Al Flora, Jr. (“Flora”), the former acting Public Defender\nof Luzerne County, and three indigent criminal defendants who had been denied\nrepresentation by Luzerne’s chronically underfunded OPD filed a Class Action\nComplaint. (R. 7a-11a.) The Complaint alleged deficiencies in the OPD’s funding\nand operations that prevented the plaintiff class from being represented in a\nmanner consistent with constitutional and ethical obligations. (R. 12a-40a.)\nThe Appellee-Defendants are Luzerne County (“County”) and its County\nManager, Robert C. Lawton (“Lawton”), who is named in his official capacity.\n(R. 854a at ¶¶ 12-13.) As Chief Executive Officer for the County’s government\n(Id.), Lawton is responsible for the day-to-day functions of County government,\nincluding budgeting matters and allocation of County resources. (Id.)\nFlora and the original class plaintiffs filed a motion for a peremptory writ of\nmandamus and for a preliminary injunction on April 12, 2012, seeking the\nresources necessary to correct the deficiencies in the OPD. (R. 134a-40a.) The\nHonorable Joseph Augello held a hearing on the motion on May 10, 2012.\n(R. 722a.) On May 16, 2012, after the preliminary injunction hearing, but before\nissuing its ruling, the trial court ordered the parties to engage in mediation. (R.\n575a.) The County filed preliminary objections to the original Class Complaint,\nwhich were overruled in their entirety on May 24, 2012. (R. 583a-84a.)\n3\n\nOn June 15, 2012, Judge Augello entered an Order and Opinion granting the\nmotions for a peremptory writ of mandamus and for a preliminary injunction,\n(R. 719a-21a), and ordered the following:\n(a) Defendants shall not prevent the public defender from filling\nvacant positions;\n(b) Defendants shall review the operations and staffing of the\ncounty public defender’s office and provide a plan to meet the constitutional\nobligations for indigent representation in accordance with the principles set\nforth in the foregoing opinion;\n(c) Defendants shall submit a report to this court within a\nreasonable time outlining its plan to meet its constitutional obligations in\nregard to the operation, staffing and expenses of the office of public\ndefender;\n(d) The defendant, county manager, is directed to provide adequate\noffice space in order to permit confidential communications between\nassistant public defenders and indigent criminal defendants within 30 days\nof the date of this order; and\n(e) The office of public defender is not permitted to refuse\nrepresentation to qualified indigent criminal defendants.\n(R. 719a-20a) (emphasis in original). In addition, Judge Augello ordered the\nfollowing with regard to the individual plaintiffs:\n(a) defendants shall allocate sufficient funds to allow for the\nprovision of private counsel to represent the named plaintiffs in their\nongoing criminal proceedings; or\n(b) provide representation to the named plaintiffs in their ongoing\ncriminal proceedings through an augmented office of public defender; or\n(c) secure pro bono counsel as available or conflict counsel if\ncurrent case load assignments permits to represent the named plaintiffs in\ntheir ongoing criminal proceedings; and\n4\n\n(d) the office of public defender is not permitted to refuse\nrepresentation to qualified indigent criminal defendants.\n(R. 721a) (emphasis in original).\nMediation failed and the County produced neither the plan nor the report it\nhad been ordered to prepare. Instead, on January 29, 2013, the County petitioned\nthe court for a trial date. (R. 791a-95a.) On March 26, 2013, Judge Augello\nscheduled trial for June 24, 2013. (R. 807a-09a.)\nThe County’s Board of Commissioners voted to replace Flora as Chief\nPublic Defender in April of 2013.1 On May 1, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion\nfor leave to file an Amended Class Action Complaint. (R. 830a-33a.) In the new\npleading, among other changes, class plaintiffs were substituted and allegations\nwere changed where necessary to acknowledge developments in the case. (R.\n850a-86a). However, the Amended Complaint’s substantive allegations and\nrequested relief remained essentially the same.2 (Compare R. 47a-48a with\nR. 885a.) After argument, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file the\n1 Florafiled anactioninfederal district court under theCivil Rights Act,42U.S.C.§1983,\nclaimingaviolationofhis right tofreespeechbythis retaliatorydismissal. Thecasewas\ndismissedbythedistrict court but theThirdCircuit Court ofAppeals reversed,findingsufficient\nallegations tosupport theFirst Amendment claim. Thematterwas remandedtothedistrict court\nwhereit is currentlyinlitigation. See Florav.Cnty. of Luzerne,776 F.3d169(3dCir.2015).\n2 See Florav. LuzerneCnty.,No.CIV.A.3:13-1478,2013WL4520854,at *3-4(M.D.\nPa.Aug.26,2013)(removal ofappellants’ case from statecourt was invalidbecause “thecore\nclaim ofthecomplaint has not changed,that is that underfundingofthe OPDis resultingin\nviolations ofindigent individuals’rights underthe UnitedStates andPennsylvania\nConstitutions”).\n5\n\nAmended Class Action Complaint on May 7, 2013, but without prejudice to the\nCounty’s filing preliminary objections. (R. 846a-47a.)\nOn May 15, 2013, Flora, appellants Kuren, Allabaugh and a third named\nplaintiff filed the Amended Class Action Complaint. (R. 850a-86a.) Now\nremoved from office, Flora filed in his individual capacity. Appellants Kuren and\nAllabaugh, along with Charles Hammonds3 and Joshua Lozano, sought to represent\nthe revised class of OPD clients. Each of these plaintiffs had been deemed\nqualified for OPD representation and each had been assigned an OPD attorney. (R.\n853a.) The class alleged that the OPD was unable to fulfill its constitutional role\nwith regard to representing those and other OPD clients in that: (1) OPD was\nunable to provide representation at most preliminary arraignments and at various\ncritical points of the prosecution, (R. 865a at ¶¶ 48-49; R. 866a at ¶ 53); (2) OPD\ncould not “provide confidential counsel regarding [plaintiffs’] agreement to plead\nguilty,” (R. 870a at ¶ 64); (3) OPD lawyers were unable to investigate cases or\neven confer with their clients (R. 864a at ¶ 45); and (4) that OPD attorneys often\nmissed court appointments or showed up unprepared. (R. 867a at ¶ 55.)\n3 Charles Hammonds was includedintheOriginal Complaint filedinthis matteras an\nindividual plaintiff. (R.852aat ¶5n.1.) Theothertwoplaintiffs named intheOriginal\nComplaint,withtheirpermission,weredismissed. Appellants wereunable toconferwith\nMr.Hammonds regardingdismissal ofhis claims despitecounsel’s best efforts. (Id.) The\nAmendedClass ActionComplaint proposes amodifiedplaintiffclass and a class definitionthat\ndoes not necessarilyincludeMr.Hammonds. (Id.)\n6\n\nOn May 31, 2013, appellees removed the case to the United States District\nCourt for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and moved to dismiss the Amended\nComplaint. Flora, 2013 WL 4520854, at *1. On June 12, 2013, plaintiffs moved\nto remand, and opposed the motion to dismiss. Id. On August 16, 2013, the\nmotion to remand was granted, and the matter was returned to the Luzerne County\nCourt of Common Pleas. Id.\nOn September 11, 2013, the County filed preliminary objections to the\nAmended Complaint and a motion to disqualify plaintiffs’ counsel. On\nOctober 21, 2013, the court denied the County’s motion to disqualify, and on\nOctober 22, 2013, the court sustained certain of the County’s preliminary\nobjections and dismissed the Amended Class Complaint. (R. 1085a; App. A.)\nAppellants filed a notice of appeal on November 20, 2013, and, on December 3,\n2013, the County filed a cross-appeal from the order denying disqualification. (R.\n1088a-99a.)\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court’s dismissal, holding that:\n1) the indigent plaintiffs’ constitutional claims for\nconstructive denial of counsel should be dismissed because the federal\nand state constitutions do not recognize a pre-conviction right-to-\ncounsel remedy under the circumstances alleged in the Amended\nComplaint;\n2) the indigent plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue their\nmandamus claim because the claim was barred as a matter of law.\nThe Court also held that Flora’s mandamus claim did not meet the\nlegal standard for a viable mandamus action; and\n7\n\n3) Flora was without personal standing to pursue his\nmandamus claim once he was replaced as Luzerne’s Public Defender\nand that he did not meet the prerequisites for taxpayer standing.\n(See App. B.) The Commonwealth Court declined to rule on the County’s cross-\nappeal on the disqualification ruling. Petitioners applied for reargument before the\npanel or before the Commonwealth Count en banc; that application was denied on\nDecember 2, 2014. (See App. C.)\nFlora and appellants petitioned this Court for allowance of an appeal. The\npetition was granted with regard to two of the three questions on which appellants\nsought review.4\nII. Statement of Facts\nA. Parties.\nThis action was commenced by three individual plaintiffs and by Al Flora,\nJr. (“Flora”), the former acting Public Defender of Luzerne County. Flora served\nas the County’s Chief Public Defender from 2010 to 2013. (R. 851a at ¶ 3; 853a at\n¶ 7; 856a-57a at ¶ 22.) Flora initiated this litigation while he was still in office as\nChief Defender, seeking a writ of mandamus that would have compelled the\nCounty to provide the resources OPD needed to provide constitutionally adequate\nrepresentation to its clients. (R. 862a at ¶ 41.)\n4 This Court declinedtohearFlora’s appeal ontheissueofhis standingtocontinueas a\npartytothis litigation. (SeeOrderGrantingPetitionforAllowanceofAppeal,Florav. Luzerne\nCnty.,No.951MAL2014&952MAL2014) (Pa. June30,2015)). TheCourt has also ordered\nachangeinthecaptiontoreflect this development.\n8\n\nAt the time the Amended Class Action Complaint was filed, appellants\nAdam Kuren and Steven Allabaugh were facing criminal charges in Luzerne\nCounty and were represented by the OPD. (R. 853a-54a at ¶¶ 8-11.) Appellants\nbrought claims in mandamus and under the Pennsylvania and United States\nConstitutions for equitable relief: specifically, they sought an “increase [in] . . .\nOPD’s funding to such a level that will permit the OPD to provide constitutionally\nadequate representation for them and for all similarly situated individuals.”\n(R. 852a at ¶ 6.) They sought certification of a class comprised of “all indigent\nadults in Luzerne County who are or will be represented by the Office of the Public\nDefender from this point until the Office of the Public Defender has the funding\nand resources necessary to enable it to meet ethical, legal, and constitutional\nstandards of representation.” (R. 851a-52a at ¶ 4.)\nB. The Long-Standing Deficiencies in the Luzerne OPD\nIn his June 15, 2012 Order and Opinion granting Flora’s motion for\nperemptory mandamus relief, Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas Judge\nAugello concluded, “[t]o describe the state of affairs in the Office of the Public\nDefender as approaching crisis stage is not an exaggeration.” (R. 851a at ¶ 2)\n(quoting R. 738a.) As the Amended Complaint alleges and as the largely\nuncontested evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing demonstrated, the OPD\nas currently resourced cannot provide adequate or effective legal representation to\n9\n\nits indigent criminal defendants at all critical stages of the legal proceedings\nagainst them. (R. 865a-876a at ¶¶ 48-94.)\nOn average, OPD lawyers handle over 4,000 new criminal cases each year.\nAt least half of these cases are felonies. (R. 868a at ¶ 58; 872a at ¶ 77.) More than\n1,000 criminal cases typically carry over from year-to-year. (R. 872a at ¶ 77.) In\naddition to these criminal prosecutions, OPD lawyers are also required to represent\nclients in sentencing appeals, mental health cases and appeals, state parole cases\nand appeals, and county probation/parole revocation proceedings. (R. 872a-73a at\n¶¶ 78-82.)\nAt the hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary relief before Judge\nAugello, Norman Lefstein, Dean Emeritus and Professor of Law at Indiana\nUniversity School of Law and a nationally-recognized expert on indigent defense,\ntestified that as of December 19, 2011, eleven part-time OPD lawyers were\nhandling an average of 73.6 felony cases and 33 misdemeanor cases at one time.5\nNT 186-87. (R. 634a-35a.) OPD’s full-time lawyers were handling similar\ncaseloads in December of 2011: 54 felony cases and 43.25 misdemeanor cases on\naverage, for a total of 97.25 simultaneous cases per lawyer. These caseloads for\n5 In April 2012,OPD’s adult unit employed13part-timeattorneys, four full-time\nattorneys, threeinvestigators, foursecretaries, one receptionist,andoneofficeadministrator.\nAmendedComplaint,at ¶38(R.861a.) Part-time OPDlawyers were contractedtowork1,000\nhours a year. NT186(R. 634a.)\n10\n\nfull-time OPD lawyers did not include 570 state parole and probation active\nviolation cases.\nDean Lefstein testified that the caseloads for these lawyers exceeded\nacceptable standards for criminal defense attorneys. NT 191 (R. 636a.) As a result\nof these high caseloads and the lack of necessary administrative support, in Dean\nLefstein’s expert opinion, OPD lawyers engaged in “a form of triage\nrepresentation, where you deal only with the most immediate problem of the day,\nbecause that is all you really can do.” NT 196. (R. 637a.) In Dean Lefstein’s\nview, OPD lawyers burdened with these conditions could not provide\nrepresentation that met constitutional standards. NT 196-97 (R. 637a.)\nThe allegations, as supported by the testimony at the preliminary injunction\nhearing, show that OPD’s overwhelming caseload, combined with the County’s\nchronic and longstanding failure to provide the office with an adequate level of\nresources, prevents OPD lawyers handling their cases in a manner that ensures\nconstitutional standards are met. (R. 865a at ¶ 49; 875a at ¶ 90.) This is not\nbecause of lack of effort or commitment on the part of these lawyers. (R. 856a-65a\nat ¶¶ 22-47; 865a-75a at ¶¶ 50-91.)\nIf this case is allowed to go to trial, the evidence will show that the problems\narising from these deficiencies first manifest themselves during the pretrial stage of\nthe OPD’s representations. As the Amended Complaint alleges, OPD lawyers are\n11\n\nunable to provide representation or support at most preliminary arraignments, the\npoint at which the right to counsel attaches under the law. (R. 866a at ¶ 53.) The\nOPD’s heavy caseload combined with other factors regularly leads to scheduling\nconflicts, causing OPD lawyers to request continuances of critical proceedings,\nwhich lead to OPD clients remaining in pre-trial detention for longer periods than\nshould be necessary. (R. 867a at ¶ 54.)\nWhere OPD lawyers are present for their clients’ pretrial proceedings, they\ndo not have time to prepare properly or to consult with their clients. OPD lawyers\ntypically cannot meet with their clients until shortly before they appear for\npreliminary hearings. (R. 869a-71a at ¶¶ 61-70.) After the initial proceedings,\nOPD lawyers are unable to maintain regular communication with their clients, and\nthey do not have the time and resources to develop their cases. (Id.) Moreover,\nOPD lawyers lack the time and resources necessary for trial preparation and\nstrategy. (R. 869a-72a at ¶¶ 61-74.)\nOPD’s deficiencies are compounded by a lack of the tools needed to\nrepresent clients effectively. (R. 874a-76a at ¶¶ 85-94.) The OPD does not have\nthe investigators, case managers, and support staff required to conduct adequate\npre-trial investigation and discovery. (R. 867a-68a at ¶¶ 56-59.) The Adult Unit of\nthe OPD has no social workers, paralegals, or trial assistants to assist with case\npreparation. (R. 874a at ¶¶ 85-86.) The OPD has only four secretaries to assist\n12\n\ntwenty-one OPD lawyers. (Id.) At the time the Amended Complaint was filed,\nmany OPD lawyers did not have their own desks, workspaces, or dedicated phone\nlines. (R. 874a-75a at ¶ 88.)\nC. Flora Attempts to Correct the OPD’s Problems\nAs the Amended Class Complaint alleges, upon his appointment as acting\nChief Public Defender in May 2010, Flora attempted to secure the resources his\noffice needed to function through Luzerne County’s normal budgetary processes.\n(R. 857a at ¶ 23.) Flora’s immediate priority after his appointment was improving\njuvenile representation in the wake of now well-documented difficulties involving\nthe operations of Luzerne County’s juvenile court system.6\nHowever, Flora continually warned the County that OPD could not handle\nthe increasing number of criminal cases involving indigent adult defendants.\n(R. 858a-59a at ¶¶ 29-31.) In June 2010, he provided the County with a status\nreport on the OPD’s representation of adults, which outlined the deficiencies\nhampering the effectiveness of OPD’s Adult Unit. (Id.) His request for additional\nresources was denied. (Id.) In July 2010, Flora provided the County with a\n6 Theissues facingthe OPDwithregardtoits representationofjuveniles in2010were\noutlinedintheReport ofthe InterbranchCommissiononJuvenileJusticeat 33-35,48-51(May\n2010),available at http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/setting-2032/file-730.pdf?cb=4beb87.\nCommissionmembers heardtestimonyfrom Flora’s predecessor, Basil Russin,onhowOPD’s\nlackofresources andthe County’s lackofresponsiveness tohis requests foradditional resources\naffectedOPD’s abilityto represent juveniles.

(R.857a at ¶ 23.)\n13\n\ndetailed, short-term plan to correct the OPD’s deficiencies, but this also was\nrejected. (Id.)\nIn his 2012 budget proposal, Flora again requested a modest expansion of\nOPD resources, but was refused. (R. 859a at ¶ 32.) When the 2012 budget was\nreopened during Luzerne County’s transition to Home Rule, Flora renewed his\nrequest for additional funding and was again ignored. (R. 859a-60a at ¶¶ 32-35.)\nFlora followed these requests with repeated private and public appeals for adequate\nstaff, office space, technology, desks, telephones, and other supplies. (R. 860a-62a\nat ¶¶ 36-39.) These requests also were denied. (Id.)\nIn December of 2011, faced with an unmanageable caseload and no sign of\nadditional funding from the County, Flora adopted a policy that restricted the type\nof clients that the OPD would represent, essentially turning away applicants with\nlower-level offenses who were not incarcerated. (R. 860a at ¶ 33.) Flora took this\nstep only after exploring other alternatives for reducing the office’s workload to\nconstitutionally acceptable levels. (Id.) With no alternative, on April 10, 2012,\nFlora and three indigent criminal defendants who were unrepresented due to the\npolicy forced on OPD by the County’s inaction initiated this lawsuit. (R. 850a-51a\nat ¶ 1; 862a at ¶ 41.)\n14\n\nSUMMARYOFTHEARGUMENT\nThe class plaintiffs have properly pleaded claims for constructive denial of\ncounsel and for the denial of effective assistance of counsel, in violation of the\nUnited States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The Sixth Amendment and Article\nI, Section 9 require that indigent defendants be represented by an attorney “who\nplays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair,” Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S.\n387, 395 (1985), and who has the ability to confer with and advise the client at\nevery stage of the case. Avery v. State of Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940).\nThe Amended Complaint alleges that Luzerne County’s indigent clients are denied\nthese basic rights by the County’s refusal to provide adequate resources to the\nPublic Defender’s Office, which has resulted in severely excessive caseloads and\n“triage” representation of OPD clients. As the trial court observed in granting\nplaintiffs’ claims for preliminary relief, the County Defendants’ funding decisions\nare “inexorably linked to both the nature and actual representation of indigent\ncriminal defendants” in Luzerne County. (R. 738a).\nNumerous federal and state courts have ruled that the systemic failure to\nprovide appointed counsel for indigent defendants with the resources necessary to\nprovide competent representation at all stages of the criminal proceeding violates\nthe right to counsel guarantee. In these cases, the courts have properly recognized\na right to equitable relief directing the government to properly staff and resource\n15\n\npublic defender offices or appointed counsel. Importantly, these courts ruled that\nthe post-conviction remedy provided by Strickland v. Washington was not an\nexclusive remedy; rather, it provided a particular remedy—a new trial—on a\nshowing of ineffective performance and prejudice.\nThe Commonwealth Court erred in ruling that the Pennsylvania Post-\nConviction Relief Act provides the sole remedy for violating a criminal\ndefendant’s right to counsel and right to effective assistance of counsel.\nRetrospective post-conviction proceedings provide one type of remedy for Sixth\nAmendment violations, but that remedy is plainly inadequate to protect against\nsystemic or structural barriers to effective assistance of counsel. The\nCommonwealth Court’s ruling is inconsistent with the great majority of courts that\nhave provided equitable relief for Sixth Amendment violations and the structure of\njudicial remedies for violations of constitutional rights, which always provide\nmultiple, complimentary avenues of relief.\nIn the alternative, the Court should rule that the lower courts erred in\nrefusing to allow the plaintiff class to proceed on its mandamus claim. Under\nPennsylvania’s law of mandamus, the courts have the authority to issue a writ that\nwould compel the County to fund its Public Defender’s Office at an “adequate”\nlevel—that is, at a level consistent with its constitutional and ethical obligations—\nas specifically required by the Public Defender Act. The Act directs counties to\n16\n\n“provide adequate representation” for persons charged with crimes “who for lack\nof sufficient funds are unable to obtain counsel.” The Commonwealth Court erred\nin holding that mandamus was unavailable. First, the County does not have\nunlimited discretion under the Act to determine the level at which the Public\nDefender’s office should be funded. Second, there are no legal remedies available\nto indigent defendants whose rights are adversely affected by the County’s funding\ndecisions. Third, the invocation of mandamus powers does not implicate\nseparation of powers concerns. This is a fully appropriate case in mandamus, as\nappellants request only an order compelling a county to fund a governmental\nfunction delegated to it by the legislature at the level required by the statute.\n17\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Class Plaintiffs Have Properly Pleaded Claims For A Constructive\nDenial of Counsel and for the Denial of Effective Assistance of Counsel\nResulting from the Defendants’ Failure to Provide Adequate Resources\nto the Luzerne County Public Defender Office\nA. Introduction\nThe Commonwealth Court made a fundamental doctrinal error in ruling that\nthe Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”) provides the sole remedy\nfor a violation of a criminal defendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel.\nThese rights were established by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), and\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and, as with all constitutionally\nguaranteed rights, the courts have adopted a number of complementary remedial\nmeasures to ensure their enforcement and implementation. In Pennsylvania, the\nright to effective assistance of counsel can be remedied under the PCRA if the\ndefendant can show an absolute denial of counsel, “constructive” denial of counsel,\nor ineffective counsel. Ineffectiveness in a post-conviction context requires a\nshowing that counsel failed to provide reasonably competent services and resulting\nprejudice, as defined as a reasonable probability of a different result if counsel had\nperformed in a competent manner. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686; United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984); Commonwealth v. Pierce, 527 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1987).\nHowever, as state and federal courts have repeatedly ruled, retrospective\npost-conviction proceedings are not the only means of vindicating Sixth\n18\n\nAmendment rights. To the contrary, as with all other rights guaranteed by the Bill\nof Rights and Fourteenth Amendment, there are multiple remedies available under\nthe federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, including equitable relief designed\nto operate prospectively to prevent on-going, systemic denial of rights to\nindividuals or a class of persons adversely affected by the policy or practice. Of\ncourse, in these cases, as in all matters seeking injunctive relief the plaintiff must\nshow both the denial of a right and the need for an injunction to remedy on-going\nviolations. See, e.g., Allee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802 (1974). In this case, as\ndetailed below, the complaint more than adequately alleges all of these elements.\nThe Commonwealth Court’s ruling that no remedy other than post-conviction\nrelief is available is a true outlier, and this Court should reinstate the Complaint\nand permit plaintiffs the opportunity to prove their case.\nB. The Systemic Denial of Basic Guarantees Protected by the Sixth\nAmendment Caused by Lack of Adequate Resources for a Public\nDefender Office Provides a Basis for Equitable Remedial Relief\nIn Strickland v. Washington, the Court addressed two questions: (1) is there\na right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, and (2) if so,\nwhat are the standards for evaluating whether the right was violated after a\nconviction and where the defendant seeks a remedy of a new trial. In this context,\nthe Court, in balancing the interests of the defendant in effective assistance, a\ndefense lawyer’s broad discretion in adopting strategic and tactical measures, and\n19\n\nthe state’s interest in avoiding a retrial where the incompetent performance did not\nprejudice the defendant, adopted the now well-established “performance” and\n“prejudice” standards. Pennsylvania has incorporated these standards in the PCRA\nand has authorized relief in the form of a new trial where these elements are\nproven. The post-conviction relief afforded under the Strickland standards is\ntherefore a function of the competing interests that emerge after conviction where\nthe central issue is whether the defendant is entitled to a new trial. As with\nvirtually all rights of a criminal defendant, the violation of the right to effective\nassistance of counsel will result in a new trial only on a showing of some level of\nharm, as measured by the harmless error doctrine on appeal and the prejudice\nstandard under the PCRA.\nImportantly, the issues of (i) whether a right was violated and (ii) whether\nsuch a violation should result in a new trial or other remedy are quite separate. As\nan example,7 a Fourth Amendment violation may result in: suppression of evidence\n(though not under all circumstances), compare Commonwealth v. Johnson¸ 86\nA.3d 182 (Pa. 2014) (affirming suppression of evidence seized incident to arrest\nbased on expired warrant) and Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009)\n(recognizing availability of suppression as a remedy in some situations, but not in\ncircumstances of that case); equitable injunctive relief, City of Los Angles v. Patel,\n7 Seeinfra at 35-36for furtherexamples.\n20\n\n576 U.S. ____, 135 S. Ct. 2443 (2015) (enjoining enforcement of unconstitutional\nmunicipal ordinance requiring hotel owners to produce records regarding their\nguests); and/or a damages claim. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961) (reversing\ndismissal of claim for damages for violation of Fourth Amendment rights),\noverruled on other grounds by Monell v. Dep’t of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658\n(1978).8 Thus, even in cases in which suppression is not granted or a new trial is\ndenied on appeal on harmless error grounds, other remedies—including\nprospective civil remedies—are available.\nSimilarly, Gideon and Strickland establish a broader scope of rights under\nthe Sixth Amendment than those that can be remedied on a post-conviction\npetition. A lawyer who fails to properly investigate the case, interview witnesses,\nfile appropriate motions, communicate and consider plea offers, challenge the use\nof evidence obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees, conduct proper\ncross-examination of witnesses, and understand all of the legal issues—\nsubstantive, procedural and evidentiary—will deprive the client of Sixth\nAmendment rights, regardless of whether the errors in representation ultimately\nresult in Strickland-type prejudice.\n8 InPennsylvaniatheexclusionaryruleunderArticle I,Section8oftheConstitution\nprovides greaterprotections forthecriminal defendant thantheFourthAmendment. See,e.g.,\nJohnson,86A.3dat 187-88.\n21\n\nIndigent defendants are entitled to be represented by an attorney “who plays\nthe role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.” Lucey, 469 U.S. at 395. The\npretrial phase of a prosecution is “perhaps . . . the most critical stage” of a lawyer’s\nrepresentation, because “it provides a basis upon which most of the defense case\nmust rest.” House v. Balkcom, 725 F.2d 608, 618 (11th Cir. 1984). See also\nSoffar v. Dretke, 368 F.3d 441, 473-76 (5th Cir.), amended on reh’g in part, 391\nF.3d 703 (5th Cir. 2004) (failure to interview witnesses who would have\ncorroborated defense theory is incompetent performance). The ability of counsel\nto confer with and advise the client at every stage of the case is an essential\ncomponent of adequate representation. Avery, 308 U.S. at 446. See also\nCommonwealth v. Gadsden, 832 A.2d 1082, 1088 (Pa. Super. 2003). Plea\nnegotiations are another “critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel.” Padilla v. Kentucky, 559\nU.S. 356, 373 (2010); Commonwealth v. Hickman, 799 A.2d 136, 141 (Pa. Super.\n2002).\nThe failure to perform any of these essential tasks constitutes a violation of\nthe Sixth Amendment, whether or not it affects the outcome of the case. When\nviewed through the lens of Gideon and Strickland, “the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel is broader than the question of whether a court must retrospectively set\naside a judgment due to ineffective assistance of counsel.” State ex rel. Mo. Pub.\n22\n\nDefender Comm’n v. Waters, 370 S.W. 3d 592, 607 (Mo. 2012). See also Public\nDefender, Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Fla. v. State, 115 So.3d 261, 276 (Fla. 2013)\n(“[D]eficiencies that do not meet the ‘ineffectiveness’ standard may nonetheless\nviolate a defendant’s rights under the sixth amendment” (quoting Luckey v. Harris,\n860 F.2d 1012, 1017 (11th Cir. 1988) (“Luckey I”), dismissed on federal\nabstention grounds, 976 F.2d 673 (11th Cir. 1992)).\nThe Commonwealth Court improperly conflated the new trial remedy under\nStrickland v. Washington and the basic Sixth Amendment rights under Gideon and\nStrickland for an indigent defendant to be competently represented at all stages of\nthe criminal proceeding. The PCRA provides a remedial mechanism for the\nformer, but equitable relief may be essential in cases of systemic or structural\nviolations of the latter. The nature of the PCRA relief provides further reasons for\nthe need for alternative remedies. In Pennsylvania, the post-conviction remedy for\nineffectiveness of counsel is even more limited than that authorized by Strickland.\nNot only must the defendant plead and prove incompetent performance and\nprejudice, but she must also show that the ineffectiveness “so undermined the\ntruth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could\nhave taken place.” Commonwealth v. Kimball, 724 A.2d 326, 333 (Pa. 1999).\nFurther, under the Act, a large number of defendants will have no opportunity to\neven file for PCRA relief as the Act does not permit relief for a person who has\n23\n\ncompleted her criminal sentence. This Court has ruled that in the absence of\nexceptional circumstances, ineffectiveness claims must await the PCRA process\n(following a direct appeal), see Commonwealth v. Grant, 821 A.2d 1246 (Pa.\n2003), thus foreclosing relief for those who were sentenced to relatively short or\nprobationary sentences. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9543(a).\nThe Commonwealth Court’s rejection of injunctive relief runs contrary to\nthe rulings of almost every other court that has considered the issue. As the Court\nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit explained:\nThe Sixth Amendment protects rights that do not affect\nthe outcome of a trial. Thus, deficiencies that do not meet\nthe “ineffectiveness” standard may nonetheless violate a\ndefendant’s rights under the Sixth Amendment. In the\npost-trial context, such errors may be deemed harmless\nbecause they did not affect the outcome of the trial.\nWhether an accused has been prejudiced by the denial of\na right is an issue that relates to relief—whether the\ndefendant is entitled to have his or her conviction\noverturned—rather than to the question of whether such a\nright exists and can be protected prospectively.\nLuckey I, 860 F.2d at 1017 (allowing claims by a class of all indigent criminal\ndefendants and all attorneys representing them for constitutionally inadequate\nindigent defense).9\n9 TheCommonwealthCourt offeredan alternativereason forthe dismissal ofplaintiffs’\nclaims: that plaintiffs hadfailedtoset fortha claim forconstructivedenial ofcounsel,and could\nnot amendtodoso, becausetheyhadnot yet been convicted:\nThe amended complaint does not allege facts to support the\ninference that the Indigent Clients have or will suffer irreparable\n24\n\nThe Strickland emphasis on “prejudice” is a function of the relief sought in\npost-conviction proceedings and is not co-extensive with the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel itself. “Whether an accused has been prejudiced by the denial of a\nright is an issue that relates to relief—whether the defendant is entitled to have his\nor her conviction overturned.” Luckey I, 860 F.2d at 1017. Plaintiffs have pleaded\na claim that they will not be adequately represented as a result of the County’s\nfailure to provide a functioning OPD, and have pleaded that they will be harmed—\nregardless of the outcome of their cases—because of that failure of representation.\nWhile it is true that there is no “prejudice” under Strickland until there is a\nconviction, there is “harm” under both Gideon and Strickland whenever a criminal\ndefendant faces a critical point in the proceedings without the effective assistance\nof counsel. And where there is harm, or, as relevant here, threatened harm, to a\nperson’s constitutional rights, there is a remedy under Section 1983.\nAs the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled,\nIt is entirely logical to generally place the decisive\nemphasis in a court opinion on the fairness of a trial and\nthe reliability of a verdict when addressing a criminal\nappeal alleging ineffective assistance because the\nharm, but only the fear that they will not be adequately\nrepresented.\nOpinionat 16. As statedin LuckeyIandothercases, seeinfraat 26-31,lackofadequate\nrepresentationis aviolationoftheSixthAmendment,whetherornot that failureof\nrepresentationgives rise toaclaim foranewtrial underStrickland.\n25\n\nappellant is seeking a remedy that vacates the verdict\nand remands the case for a new trial.\nDuncan v. State, 774 N.W.2d 89, 125 (Mich. App. 2009) (emphasis in original),\naff’d on other grounds, 780 N.W.2d 843 (Mich.), reconsideration granted, order\nvacated, 784 N.W.2d 51 (Mich.), rev’d, 784 N.W.2d 51 (Mich.), order vacated on\nreconsideration, 790 N.W.2d 695 (Mich.), order reinstated, 790 N.W.2d 695\n(Mich.), order vacated on reconsideration, 790 N.W.2d 695 (Mich.),\nreconsideration denied, 791 N.W.2d 713 (Mich. 2010).10 But “[a]pplying the two-\npart test from Strickland . . . as an absolute requirement defies logic, where . . . the\nrequested remedy in the form of prospective relief seeks to curb and halt\ncontinuing acts of deficient performance,” not to overturn a conviction already\nobtained. Id.\nThe Supreme Court of Florida, reaching the same conclusion, explained:\n[T]here are powerful considerations in the postconviction\ncontext that warrant the deferential prejudice\nstandard. . . . These considerations do not apply when\nonly prospective relief is sought. “Prospective relief is\ndesigned to avoid future harm. Therefore, it can protect\nconstitutional rights, even if the violation of these rights\nwould not affect the outcome of a trial.”\n10 ThecomplicatedhistoryofDuncan resultedinan affirmanceofthetrial court’s refusal to\ndismiss theclaims ofaclass ofindigent defendants whoallegedthat threecounties’public\ndefendersystems failedtoprovideconstitutionallysufficient representation. TheCourt\nexplainedthat “[t]his caseis at its earliest stages and,basedsolelyontheplaintiffs’pleadings in\nthis case,it is prematuretomakeadecisiononthesubstantiveissues.” Duncan,780N.W.2dat\n844. Thesameholds truehere.\n26\n\nPublic Defender, Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Fla., 115 So.3d at 276 (quoting\nLuckey I, 860 F.2d at 1017 (internal citation omitted)).11\nThe Supreme Court of Iowa echoed these concerns in upholding a contract\nattorney’s right to prospective relief from compensation rates so low that they\nprevented him from providing meaningful representation. Although “[t]he most\nfamiliar avenue for enforcement of the right to effective assistance of counsel is\nthrough a post-conviction challenge to an underlying conviction . . . [t]here is,\nhowever, a second potential avenue for enforcement of the right to counsel.”\nSimmons v. State Pub. Defender, 791 N.W.2d 69, 75-76 (Iowa 2010). This second\navenue, also known as a systemic or a structural challenge, “is based on the notion\n11 TheFloridaSupremeCourt mentionedallegations offailureofcounsel strikinglysimilar\ntothoseinthis case:\nAttorneys are routinely unable to interview clients, conduct\ninvestigations, take depositions, prepare mitigation, or counsel\nclients about pleas offered at arraignment. Instead, the office\nengages in “triage” with the clients who are in custodyor who face\nthe most serious charges getting priority to the detriment of the\notherclients.\nPublic Defender, Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Fla., 115 So. 3d at 274 (footnote omitted).\nIn afootnote,the court observedthat the evidence presented:\nwas not evidence of isolated incidents, but of systemic inability of\nthe public defender attorneys to perform these functions on a\nregular basis. The United States Supreme Court once warned that\nthe “denial of opportunity for appointed counsel to confer, to\nconsult with the accused and to prepare his defense, could convert\nthe appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a\nformal compliancewiththeConstitution....”\nId. at 274n.8(quotingAvery,308U.S.at 446).\n27\n\nthat in order to ensure effective assistance of counsel for indigent defendants, the\nstate has an affirmative obligation to establish a system of indigent defense that is\nreasonably likely to provide for zealous advocacy on behalf of the criminal\ndefendant.” Id. (emphasis added).\nWe conclude that the Strickland prejudice test does not\napply in cases involving systemic or structural challenges\nto the provision of indigent defense counsel that do not\ninvolve efforts to vacate criminal convictions. As\npointed out in Luckey, the weighty policy reasons for the\nhigh Strickland bar—namely, finality in criminal\njudgments and the fear of a rash of ineffective-assistance\nclaims—are simply not present here.\nSimmons, 791 N.W.2d at 85 (footnote omitted).\nThe highest court in New York State has also ruled that a court does not\nneed to wait for the outcome of a prosecution to determine that criminal defendants\nwho have counsel in name only are harmed:\n[T]he absence of representation at critical stages is\ncapable of causing grave and irreparable injury to\npersons who will not be convicted. Gideon’s guarantee\nto the assistance of counsel does not turn upon a\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and neither can the\navailability of a remedy for its denial.\nHurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217, 227 (N.Y. 2010).\nThis Court has, likewise, recognized that systemic deficiencies in indigent\ndefense cannot be relegated to individual post-conviction proceedings. In\nCommonwealth v. McGarrell, Nos. 77-79 EM 2011 (Pa. Sept. 28, 2011), this Court\n28\n\ngranted a pre-trial request for extraordinary jurisdiction on a petition filed on\nbehalf of defendants facing capital charges in Philadelphia who argued that the fee\nschedule for appointed counsel was so inadequate as to likely lead to ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The Court ordered an evidentiary hearing on this issue and\nthe trial court made findings that the “existing compensation system unacceptably\nincreases the risk of ineffective assistance of counsel” and was “grossly\ninadequate.” Report of Judge Benjamin Lerner, McGarrell, No. 77 EM 2011 (Feb.\n21, 2012).12 The Court of Common Pleas then raised the allowable fees for\nappointed capital counsel and on appeal this Court affirmed (with the Justices\ndivided only on the issue of whether the fee increase was sufficient to cure the\nsystemic denial of effective counsel). Commonwealth v. McGarrell, 87 A.3d 809\n(Pa. 2014). Justice (now Chief Justice) Saylor dissented, finding that the systemic\nproblems remained and that “Pennsylvania’s capital punishment regime is in\ndisrepair.” Id. at 811 (Saylor, J., dissenting). See also id. at 812 (McCaffrey, J.\ndissenting) (finding “abundant evidence” of “chronic underfunding”).\nIn addition, opinions of this Court have noted the systemic failings of\nindigent defense in Pennsylvania in specific contexts. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\nKing, 57 A.3d 607, 635-38 (Pa. 2012) (Saylor, J., concurring) (“Of greatest\nconcern, these sorts of exceptionally costly failures, particularly as manifested\n12Availableat http:// www.atlanticcenter.org/images/LernerReport.pdf.\n29\n\nacross the wider body of cases, diminish the State’s credibility in terms of its\nability to administer capital punishment and tarnish the justice system, which is an\nessential component of such administration.”); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 985\nA.2d 915, 928 (Pa. 2009) (Saylor, J., concurring). See also Thomas G. Saylor,\nDeath-Penalty Stewardship and the Current State of Pennsylvania Capital\nJurisprudence, 23 Widener L.J. 1, 38, 40 (2013) (“Funding of indigent defense\nservices, obviously, is a major source of concern. . . . This kind of decentralized\narrangement risks inequalities, in tension with the kind of non-arbitrary treatment\nthe Supreme Court of the United States has been looking for since Furman.”). “As\nnumerous statewide indigent defense studies have shown, when counties primarily\nfund indigent defense, there are certain to be inequities among the locally funded\nsystems.” See The Constitution Project, Justice Denied: America’s Continuing\nNeglect of Our Constitutional Right to Counsel 54-55 (2009), available at\nhttp://www.constitutionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/139.pdf.\nThe United States Department of Justice has joined the courts that have\nrecognized the validity of pre-trial constructive deprivation of counsel claims. In a\nStatement of Interest filed with the Hurrell-Harring trial court, the Justice\nDepartment opined that a court could find a constructive denial of counsel when:\n(1) on a systemic basis, counsel for indigent\ndefendants face severe structural limitations, such as a\nlack of resources, high workloads, and under staffing of\npublic defender offices; and/or\n30\n\n(2) indigent defenders are unable or are significantly\ncompromised in their ability to provide the traditional\nmarkers of representation for their clients, such as timely\nand confidential consultation, appropriate investigation,\nand meaningful adversarial testing of the prosecution’s\ncase.\nStatement of Interest of the United States at 7, Hurrell-Harring v. New York, No.\n8866-07 (N.Y. Sept. 25, 2014), available at\nhttp://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2014/09/25/hurrell_soi_9-25-\n14.pdf (hereinafter “Hurrell-Harring Statement of Interest”) (emphasis in\noriginal).13\nC. The Availability of Multiple Remedies for a Constitutional\nViolation is a Characteristic of Our Constitutional System\nAs noted above, supra at 20-21, the constitutional guarantees embedded in\nthe Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment are enforceable by a\ncomplementary set of remedial mechanisms. Thus, in the Fourth Amendment\ncontext, as noted above, supra, at 20-21, a violation of the Fourth Amendment may\n13 Subsequent totheDOJ’s submission,Hurrell-Harringwas settledwithaStipulationand\nOrderthat provides for: 1)acommitment bythedefendants that within20 months eachindigent\ncriminal defendant intheaffectedcounties will be representedbycounsel at arraignment; 2)\ncommitments byNewYorkstatetothecreationofasystem that wouldkeeptrackof caseloads,\nandtotheenactment ofappropriatecaseloadstandards; 3)acommitment that anycaseload\nstandardadopted as aresult ofthis process wouldbeconsistent withtheguidelines adoptedby\ntheNational AdvisoryCommissiononCriminalJusticeStandards andGoals; 4)theadoptionof\nplans forhiringadditional staffas maybenecessarytomeet the guidelines; and5)other\nmeasures meant toimprovethequalityofindigent defenseinthe affected counties.

Alternatively, a court can order injunctive relief to\nenjoin a pattern or practice of violations of the Fourth Amendment, or award\ndamages for proven violations, all independent of any criminal prosecutions or\nconsiderations of application of the exclusionary rule.\nThe Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, likewise, gives rise to\nseveral different avenues of relief. A violation of the right may be remedied by a\nsuppression ruling, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), a claim for\ndamages for false or coerced confessions, see, e.g., Halsey v. Pfeiffer, 750 F.3d\n273 (3d Cir. 2014), or by an injunction prohibiting police from engaging in\nconduct that will result in the denial of Fifth Amendment rights. See, e.g.,\nCalifornia Attorneys for Criminal Justice v. Butts, 195 F.3d 1039 (9th Cir. 2000).\nAs with the Fourth Amendment, the damage and equitable remedies are entirely\nindependent of suppression rights or the issue of ordering a new trial where a\ncoerced or involuntary confession has been used to secure a conviction.\nThe same is true for the right to be free from the use of fabricated or false\nevidence. See, e.g., Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213 (1942) (due process reversal of\nconviction for knowing use of false testimony); Halsey, 750 F.3d 273 (damage\nclaim for this violation); the Brady claim for disclosure of exculpatory evidence,\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) (new trial granted on appeal); Poventud v.\n32\n\nCity of New York, 750 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2014) (damages claims for Brady\nviolation); the right against cruel and unusual punishment, see, e.g., Glossip v.\nGross, 576 U.S. ____, 135 S. Ct 2726 (2015) (addressing issue in injunctive\nproceeding as to the constitutionality of lethal injection process); Hope v. Pelzer,\n536 U.S. 730 (2002) (damages claim for cruel and unusual prison conditions); and\nfor claims of racial discrimination in the administration of justice. See Whren v.\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996) (racially motivated seizure violates Fourteenth\nAmendment, but not the Fourth Amendment); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79\n(1986) (reversal of conviction for racially based peremptory jury challenges);\nFloyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (injunctive relief\nfor systemic racial bias in policing).14\nD. Plaintiffs Have Properly Alleged Both Constructive Denial of\nCounsel and Denial of Effective Assistance of Counsel Due to\nChronic and Systemic Underfunding of the Luzerne County OPD\nThe systemic barriers to effective assistance of counsel that have been the\nbasis for court intervention in injunctive proceedings are present in the Luzerne\nCounty Public Defender’s Office. There is evidence of record that the OPD’s\ncaseloads are “clearly excessive” and that as a result OPD could provide only\n14 Forliberties not directlyassociatedwiththecriminal justicesystem,e.g., First\nAmendment rights of freespeech andassociationandfortheSecondAmendment right tobear\narms, thesameis true. See,e.g.,Haguev.CIO,307U.S.496(1939)(injunctiverelief for\nsystemicviolations offreespeech rights); AmnestyInt’l v. Battle,559 F.3d 1170(11thCir.\n2009)(damageclaim for First Amendment violation); CityofHoustonv. Hill,482U.S.451\n(1987)(reversingcriminal convictionbasedonoverbroadstatute).\n33\n\n“triage representation” at its current level of funding. (Opinion at 13-14, R. 734a-\n35a.) As set forth in the Statement of the Case, supra at 4-5, 10-11, at the hearing\nfor preliminary relief, the trial court found that the evidence presented by\nPetitioners showed the seriously adverse impact of lack of resources on defender\nrepresentation to be “in large measure uncontroverted and uncontradicted.” (Id. at\n16, R. 730a-32a.)\nThe Amended Complaint, which is based in part on that evidence, sets forth\nnumerous routine failures of representation by OPD attorneys, beginning with the\ncomplete lack of representation at preliminary arraignments, a literal denial of\ncounsel (see R. 866a at ¶ 53), and continuing through every stage of pretrial\nrepresentation, trial itself, and plea negotiations:\n106. Defendants’ refusal and failure to provide the OPD with the\nnecessary funding and resources prevents OPD lawyers from\nproviding representation at all critical phases of their cases for all\nadult indigent defendants in Luzerne County. Specifically,\nattorneys in the office were, and continue to be, frequently:\na. Unable to interview or meet with clients prior to\npreliminary hearings;\nb. Unable to contact their clients between court\nappearances;\nc. Unable to conduct significant, if any, investigation or\ndiscovery;\nd. Unable to engage in significant, if any, motion practice;\n34\n\ne. Unable to gather adequate information to engage in\neffective plea negotiations;\nf. Unable to engage in sufficient trial preparation; and\ng. Unable to properly litigate appeals because of a lack of\nappellate experience.\n(R. 881a at ¶ 106.)\nThe Amended Complaint provides extensive detail concerning these failures\nof representation. (See generally R. 865a-71a). Under these circumstances, “even\nthe best lawyers are unable to engage in many of the basic functions of\nrepresentation, including conferring with clients in a meaningful way prior to\ncritical stages of their legal proceedings, reviewing client files, conducting\ndiscovery, motion practice, and factual investigation, as well as devoting necessary\ntime to prepare for hearings, trials, and appeals.” (R. 864a at ¶ 45) (emphasis\nadded). These allegations and evidentiary proof are precisely of the kind that the\nDepartment of Justice has stated will support claims seeking prospective remedies\nfor the constructive denial of counsel and for the denial of effective assistance of\ncounsel. See Hurrell-Harring Statement of Interest at 7.15\nIn addition, plaintiffs’ allegations are indistinguishable from the claims\nnumerous appellate courts have found to state valid claims for injunctive relief.\n15 Whilewebelievethat theseallegations aresufficient tosupport thelegal claims, tothe\nextent that theCourt disagrees, plaintiffs shouldbegiventheusual right to amendtheir\npleadings. SeeConnorv.AlleghenyGen.Hosp., 461A.2d600,602(Pa.1983)(notingthat “the\nright toamendshouldbe liberallygranted”).\n35\n\nFor instance, in Hurrell-Harring, the court recognized a right to prospective relief\nwhere the plaintiffs alleged that their appointed lawyers were uncommunicative,\nmade very little or no efforts on the clients’ behalf subsequent to arraignment,\nwaived important rights without consulting the client, acted as mere conduits for\nplea offers, and were often unprepared to proceed when they made court\nappearances. Hurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 224. The New York Court of\nAppeals explained that “[a]ctual representation assumes a certain basic\nrepresentational relationship” and that the allegations by the indigent defendants\nraised the “distinct possibility that merely nominal attorney-client pairings” were\noccurring with regularity. Id. In Hurrell-Harring, as here, “the basic\nconstitutional mandate for the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at all\ncritical stages is at risk of being left unmet because of systemic conditions, not by\nreason of the personal failings and poor professional decisions of individual\nattorneys.” Id. at 226 (emphasis added).\nThe United States District Court for the Western District of Washington\nallowed claims to proceed on behalf of a class of indigent defendants who alleged:\nthat Mount Vernon and Burlington have implemented a\nsystem of public defense that is inadequately funded,\nimposes unreasonable caseloads on the individual\nattorneys, fails to provide representation at critical stages\nof the prosecution, and is not properly monitored.\nPlaintiffs also allege that the municipalities have known\nof the structural deficiencies in their public defense\n36\n\nsystems for many years and yet continue the system\nwithout substantive change.\n. . .\nHaving realized that they were effectively unrepresented\nagainst the prosecuting municipalities, plaintiffs can seek\njudicial intervention.

The Pennsylvania Courts Have Mandamus Authority to Compel the\nProvision of Adequate Resources for the Luzerne County Office of\nPublic Defender\nIndependent of providing an equitable remedy for the violation of the Sixth\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel, the courts of this\nCommonwealth have the authority to issue a writ of mandamus directing Luzerne\nCounty to fund its Public Defender Office pursuant to the Public Defender Act at a\nlevel that will ensure “adequate” resources for representation of its clients.\n“Mandamus is a high prerogative and remedial writ, the appropriate functions of\nwhich are the enforcement of duties to the public, by officers and others, who\neither neglect or refuse to perform them.” Commonwealth ex rel. Armstrong v.\nComm’rs of Allegheny, 37 Pa. 277, 279 (1860) (emphasis in original); see also\nMeadville Area Sch. Dist. v. Dep’t of Public Instruction, 159 A.2d 482, 500 (Pa.\n1960) (“The law is clear that an action of mandamus will lie to compel public\nofficials to perform their duties in accordance with the law”); Clark v. Meehan, 80\nA.2d 64, 66 (Pa. 1951) (“The writ of mandamus lies to compel a public official to\nperform his duties in accordance with the law”). Luzerne County’s failure to\nprovide OPD with the personnel and resources it needs to defend its clients at a\n38\n\nlevel consistent with Gideon’s guarantees and consistent with the professional\nethical responsibilities of criminal defense lawyers is a violation of the Public\nDefender Act that may be corrected by the grant of appropriate mandamus relief.\nMandamus is available where the moving party has a clear right, the\ngovernment body has a corresponding duty, and no remedy at law is adequate. See\nSeeton v. Pa. Game Comm’n, 937 A.2d 1028, 1033 (Pa. 2007); Dombrowski v.\nCity of Phila., 245 A.2d 238, 244, 249 (Pa. 1968). Appellants are entitled as a\nmatter of constitutional and statutory law to adequate criminal defense\nrepresentation by the Luzerne OPD and mandamus provides a remedial mechanism\nfor the allocation of the funds necessary to ensure that the legal representation\nprovided for indigent defendants by the OPD meets constitutional and ethical\nstandards.\nA. Under the Public Defender Act, Luzerne County is Required to\nProvide Adequate Resources to Ensure that Appellants and\nSimilarly Situated Indigent Defendants are Provided Effective\nAssistance of Counsel\nThe County’s duty to provide an adequate defense for each indigent\ndefendant is plain from the language of the Public Defender Act, 16 Pa. Stat. §§\n9960.1-9960.13. Under the Act, every county (except Philadelphia) is required to\nappoint a Public Defender, who is charged with providing representation to\nindigent defendants and others under the circumstances designated by the Act’s\n39\n\nprovisions.18 See 16 Pa. Stat. § 9960.6. The preamble to the Public Defender Act\nmakes clear that the county has a duty to provide indigent defendants with a\nconstitutionally “adequate” defense:19\nAn Act to provide for the office of public defender,\nauthorizing assistants and other personnel and to provide\nadequate representation for persons who have been\ncharged with an indictable offense or with being a\njuvenile delinquent who for lack of sufficient funds are\nunable to obtain legal counsel.\nPublic Defender Act of Dec. 2, 1968, P.L. 1144, No. 358 (emphasis added).\nTo ensure that the Public Defender can fulfill this obligation, the Act directs\ncounties to provide public defenders with sufficient funding for the personnel and\nequipment necessary to perform these duties. With regard to the hiring of\npersonnel, the Act states:\nThe public defender, with the approval of the appointive\nbody, may provide for as many full or part time assistant\npublic defenders, clerks, investigators, stenographers and\nother employees as he may deem necessary to enable him\nto carry on the duties of his office.\n16 Pa Stat. § 9960.5(a) (emphasis added). The statute establishes a collaborative\nprocess for approving budgets for the Public Defender’s office and specifically\n18 LuzerneCountyoperates underaHomeRuleCharterwhichrequires theCountyto\nappoint apublicdefender charged withprovidinglegal representationtoclients “as requiredby\napplicablelaw,”whichwouldincludethePublicDefenderAct. SeeHome RuleCharter,§6.04.\n19 Underrules ofstatutoryconstructionprescribedbythePennsylvania Assembly,“Thetitle\nandpreambleofastatute maybeconsideredintheconstructionthereof.” 1Pa.Cons. Stat.§\n1924.\n40\n\nrecognizes the Public Defender’s role in determining what level of resources will\nbe necessary to provide effective assistance of counsel. The statutory language\nevinces the legislature’s unmistakable intent: to provide public defenders with the\npersonnel “necessary to enable [him or her] to carry on the duties of [his or her]\noffice.” Id.\nIn addition, the Act directs each County’s Board of Commissioners to\nprovide “office space, furniture, equipment and supplies for the use of the public\ndefender suitable for the conduct of the business of that office.” Id. § 9960.9.\nAgain, the statute is explicit: the County must provide the public defender with an\noffice and resources that are “suitable” for the task delegated, i.e., a staff and\nequipment sufficient to provide indigent defendants with “adequate”\nrepresentation.\nThis Court has ordered mandamus relief under statutes or other laws with\ncomparable mandates. In Dombrowski v. City of Philadelphia, a Philadelphia\nemployee sought an order in mandamus compelling the city to appropriate\nsufficient funds to maintain its retirement system in an “actuarially sound”\ncondition, as required by Philadelphia’s Home Rule Charter. See Dombrowski,\n245 A.2d at 240. After a review conducted by a special master, a trial court\nordered the city to make the necessary allocations. This Court affirmed, in a ruling\n41\n\nthat required Philadelphia to allocate a sum totaling $60,000,000 over the course of\na two-year period to remedy the discrepancy. Id. at 251.\nIn Dombrowski, the City Charter provision required Philadelphia’s pension\nfund for public employees be maintained at a level defined as “actuarially sound.”\nId. at 240. In this case, the Public Defender Act requires comparable funding to\nensure that public defenders have the personnel and resources necessary to provide\nclients with an “adequate” defense. As the Pennsylvania courts may require a city\nto allocate the funding necessary to maintain its retirement accounts in an\n“actuarially sound” condition, they also have the authority to order a county to\nallocate enough funding to provide an “adequate” legal defense for indigents\naccused of crime.\nIndeed, the mandamus remedy is necessary precisely in those situations, as\nhere, where a county government has misinterpreted statutory duties. See, e.g.,\nSeeton, 937 A.2d at 1034 (holding mandamus an appropriate remedy to direct a\nstate Commission to comply with its statutory mandate “to the extent it\nmisapprehends it”); Volunteer Firemen’s Relief Ass’n of City of Reading v.\nMinehurt, 203 A.2d 476, 479-80 (Pa. 1964) (“[M]andamus will lie to compel\naction by an official where his refusal to act in the requested way stems from his\nerroneous interpretation of the law”). Moreover, a county’s funding obligation\ncannot be excused by budgetary limitations. See Commonwealth ex rel. Central\n42\n\nBd. of Education of Pittsburg v. City of Pittsburg, 58 A. 669, 670 (Pa. 1904) (per\ncuriam) (holding that when a public duty is “imposed by statute upon the\nmunicipality, mere inconvenience of compliance is not sufficient reason for refusal\nto enforce obedience by mandamus”); Kistler v. Carbon Cnty., 35 A.2d 733, 734\n(Pa. Super. 1944) (“County commissioners, . . . cannot, by adopting a budget, limit\nor avoid liabilities imposed upon the county by the Constitution or by statutes. The\ncall of the Constitution or of a statute is paramount, and they must respond to it by\nproviding sufficient appropriations”).\nThis statutory duty is particularly significant in light of the fact that\nPennsylvania has made the legislative policy choice to impose funding obligations\nfor the constitutionally required appointment of counsel in criminal cases on the\ncounties. There are policy arguments that favor state funding, see, e.g., A\nConstitutional Default: Services to Indigent Criminal Defendants in Pennsylvania,\nReport of the Task Force and Advisory Committee on Services to Indigent\nCriminal Defendants (December 2011) (recommending the creation of a statewide,\nindependent, non-partisan Office of Indigent Defense, and that funding for indigent\ndefense be provided primarily by the Commonwealth).20 But whatever the merits\nof this issue, county funding is the current operational standard. Accordingly, the\n20 Relevant pages from the Report were attachedtotheoriginal Class ActionComplaint; a\nfull copyis availableat\nhttp://jsg.legis.state.pa.us/resources/documents/ftp/documents/Indigent%20Defense.pdf.\n43\n\nstatutory commands of the Public Defender Act require “adequate” funding and\nmandamus should be available to enforce this legislative directive.\nB. The Commonwealth Court’s Reasons for Dismissing the\nMandamus Claims Are Without Merit\nThe Commonwealth Court ruled that mandamus did not provide a ground\nfor relief because: 1) a county has full and final discretion with regard to funding\nthe OPD; 2) appellants have other legal remedies; and 3) ordering the relief\nrequested would violate separation of powers principles. None of these reasons\nwithstand scrutiny.\n1. The Public Defender Act’s Requirement that an\n“Adequate” Defense Be Provided For Indigent Defendants\nIs a Mandatory Duty\nWithout reasoned analysis, the Commonwealth Court accepted Luzerne\nCounty’s argument that “its funding of the Office of Public Defender is inherently\ndiscretionary and cannot be compelled by a writ of mandamus.” Flora, 103 A.3d at\n138. This was error as the Public Defender Act requires the Public Defender to\nprovide an “adequate” defense to indigent defendants. The plain meaning of the\nword “adequate” is “sufficient . . . equal to what is required.” Black’s Law\nDictionary 36 (5th ed. 1979).21 Under this standard, a court must look to the\nconstitutional and professional ethical standards that have been adopted in\n21 Pennsylvanialawrequires that words andphrases “beconstruedaccordingtorules of\ngrammarand accordingtotheircommonandapprovedusage.” 1Pa.Cons. Stat.§1903(a).\n44\n\ndetermining the level of representation that provides effective assistance of\ncounsel. See, e.g., Missouri v. Frye, 556 U.S. ____, 132 S. Ct. 1399, 1408-09\n(2012); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387 (2003); Strickland, 466 U.S. 668;\nPierce, 527 A.2d 973; ABA Comm’n on Ethics & Prof’l Responsibility, Formal\nOp. 06-441 (2006); ABA, Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System\n(Feb. 2002).22 And it cannot be that a county could decide, without any judicial\noversight, to severely underfund a defender office to the point, as alleged here, of\neffectuating a constructive denial of counsel or a system in which clients will be\ndenied effective assistance.\nCourts in other jurisdictions have ruled under similar circumstances that\n“[w]hile criminal defendants are not entitled to perfect counsel, they are entitled to\na real, zealous advocate who will fiercely seek to protect their interests within the\nbounds of the law.” Simmons, 791 N.W. 2d at 75. An indigent defense system\nthat promotes “triage” representation of clients by tolerating excessive lawyer\ncaseloads is inadequate under Gideon. See, e.g., Public Defender, Eleventh\nJudicial Circuit of Fla., 115 So.3d at 266-67; State ex rel. Mo. Pub. Defender\nComm’n, 370 S.W. 3d 592; see also Hurrell-Harring Statement of Interest at 9-14.\nIn short, the Public Defender Act is violated where a public defender system, such\n22 Availableat\nhttp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_aid_indigent_defendants/ls_sclaid_def_tenprinci\nplesbooklet.authcheckdam.pdf\n45\n\nas that in Luzerne County, operates in a manner that either constructively denies\ncounsel or provides ineffective assistance on a systemic basis.\nAs interpreted by the Commonwealth Court, the Public Defender Act would\ngive counties unfettered discretion in determining the level of public defender\nfunding, without regard to the obligations imposed by either Gideon or ethical\nrules, thus effectively immunizing counties that fail to adequately fund indigent\ndefense. In assessing this ruling, and in interpreting the Act, this Court should be\nguided not only by the plain language of the statute, but also the mandate to\nconstrue statutes in a manner that avoids unreasonable interpretations and\nconstitutional infirmities.23 See 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 1922; see also Commonwealth\nv. Bennett, 930 A.2d 1264, 1273 (Pa. 2007) (noting that the Statutory Construction\nAct requires courts “to employ the presumption that the General Assembly does\nnot intend to violate the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions”). The\nCommonwealth Court erred in its statutory analysis and this Court should reinstate\nthe Amended Complaint to ensure enforcement of the Public Defender Act.\n23 It shouldbenotedthat theCommonwealthCourt’s conclusionontheissueofcounty\ndiscretiondifferedfrom that ofJudgeAugello. In his opiniononplaintiffs’motionfor\npreliminaryrelief, Judge Augelloproperlyheldthat indeterminingthe appropriatelevel of\nfundingforPublicDefenders’offices undertheAct,acountygovernment’s discretion“is\ncircumscribedbytheConstitution,applicablelegislation,applicableappellateprecedent andthe\nPennsylvaniaRules ofProfessional Conduct.” (R. at 738a,¶15.) JudgeAugellobasedhis\ndismissal ofthenamedplaintiffs’mandamus claim onwhat hecharacterized as appellants’lack\nofstanding. SeeOpinionofOctober22,2013, at 13-14(App.A).\n46\n\n2. Appellants Have No Adequate Remedy at Law\nThe Commonwealth Court erroneously dismissed the mandamus claim on\nthe additional ground that appellants had access to legal remedies. See Flora, 103\nA.3d at 138. As we discussed above (supra, at 23-33) the panel’s conclusion that\nindigent clients have an alternative remedy through Strickland claims (Flora, 103\nA.3d at 138) is mistaken. As numerous courts have held, and as discussed, post-\nconviction claims under Strickland are not an adequate remedy for systemic\nfailures in indigent defense that compromise the rights of numerous clients. See,\ne.g., Luckey I, 860 F.2d at 1017-18; Hurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 224, 227;\nLavallee, 812 N.E.2d at 905-06; see also Hurrell-Harring Statement of Interest.\nFurther, the Commonwealth Court’s suggestion that an adequate remedy to\nthe County’s refusal to remediate OPD’s systemic deficiencies could be found in\nthe provision of the Public Defender Act that allows public defenders to appoint\npro bono counsel to assist them is manifestly without support. While the Act\nauthorizes the use of volunteer lawyers, “[i]n lieu of, or in addition to assistant\npublic defenders,” to assist public defenders’ offices in providing indigent services,\n16 Pa. Sat. § 9960.5(b), there is no basis in this record or in the experience of any\nmodern defender office—and the Commonwealth Court fails to provide even a hint\nof such evidence—to suggest that deployment of “volunteer” lawyers could\nalleviate systemic under-funding of indigent defense. To the contrary, no system\n47\n\nof adequate criminal defense can be built on the quicksand of inexperienced and\notherwise untrained “volunteers.” See Simmons, 791 N.W. 2d at 86 (soliciting\nvolunteers is no remedy for structural deficiencies in indigent defense). Indeed,\nuse of such untrained and inexperienced “volunteers” would only worsen the\nproblem.\n3. Enforcing the Public Defender Act Would Not Violate the\nSeparation of Powers Doctrine\nFinally, the Commonwealth Court erred in suggesting that the grant of\nmandamus relief “may violate the doctrine of separation of powers.” Flora, 103\nA.3d at 138-39. To reach this conclusion the Commonwealth Court construed the\nPublic Defender Act as a statute that tied the public defender function to the\njudiciary. See id. at 138 & n.8. On that theory, the Commonwealth Court ruled\nthat the courts of Pennsylvania could issue a mandamus for funding of a function\nrelated to the “administration of justice” only in the most extreme circumstances.\nSee id. at 138-39. But whatever the limits imposed by reason of the separation of\npowers doctrine where courts seek to order the legislative or executive branches to\nsupport judicial functions, that doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, mandamus\nwould simply order a local governmental unit to follow the dictates of a statute\nwhere the party seeking enforcement is not engaging in any judicial function.\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth Court’s reliance on Beckert v. Warren, 439 A.2d\n638 (Pa. 1981), is entirely misplaced.\n48\n\nThe legislative history of the Public Defender Act makes clear that the\nPennsylvania Assembly rejected a process under which county public defender\noffices would be considered a part of the judicial branch or as serving a judicial\nfunction. The Public Defender Act was introduced in 1968 as Senate Bill No. 1769\nwith provisions requiring public defenders to be appointed “by the Board of\nCounty Commissioners and in Philadelphia by City Council.” Pa. S.B. 1769,\nGeneral Assembly of Pa., 1968 Session, November 7, 1968 (Printer’s No. 2333).\nThe Senate adopted an amendment that required public defenders to be appointed\nby the Board of County Commissioners, but “with the approval of the Court or\nCourts of Common Pleas.” Pa. S.B. 1769, General Assembly of Pa., 1968 Session,\nas amended on Third Consideration, November 13, 1968 (Printer’s No. 2382).\nThis amendment was rejected by the House. See Pa. S.B. 1769, General\nAssembly of Pa, 1968 Session, November 18 & 21, 1968 (House Reprint Nos.\n2399 and 2418). Supporters of the House version relied on policy considerations\nthat favored giving county government sole control over the public defender’s\nappointment. See 1968 Pa. Legislative Journal—House, at 1762 (November 20,\n1968). See also id. at 1778-79 (November 21, 1968). The Senate agreed, and it\nwas the House version that was signed into law. Id. at 735-36 (November 22,\n1968).\n49\n\nThe General Assembly created the Public Defender’s Office as a “county”\noffice, to be governed independently of the judiciary.24 Thus, an order compelling\nLuzerne County to fund its Office of the Public Defender at an adequate level\nwould not constitute a judicial order to fund a “judicial” function; rather, it would\nsimply direct the County to perform a duty delegated by the legislature in the\nmanner prescribed by the statute.25 As we have shown, such an order is well\nwithin the Court’s authority to grant writs of mandamus as that authority has been\ndefined historically by decisional law. See, e.g., Clark, 80 A.2d at 66 (“The writ of\nmandamus lies to compel a public official to perform his duties in accordance with\nthe law”).\nIn these circumstances, applying well-established mandamus principles,\nappellants’ burden on remand would be to prove that their requests for additional\nresources for the OPD are “reasonably necessary.” See Medico v. Makowski, 793\nA.2d 167, 170-71 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2002) (citing Jiuliante v. Cnty. of Erie, 657\nA.2d 1245, 1250 (Pa. 1995)).\n24 This determinationis consistent withtheprovisions ofthePennsylvaniaConstitution,\nwhichexpresslyincludes “publicdefenders”inits list ofcountyofficers.” SeePa.Const.Art.9,\n§4.\n25 In arelatedcontext,theUnitedStates SupremeCourt,whilerecognizingthat public\ndefenders arepaidbythe state,heldthat theseofficials arenot state actors anddonot act under\ncolorofstatelaws forpurposes ofliabilityundertheCivil Rights Act,42U.S.C.§1983,as they\noperate as adversaries of thestateinthesamemanneras privatelawyers. PolkCnty.v. Dodson,\n454U.S.312(1981).\n50\n\nIn light of these factors, it is not surprising that courts in other jurisdictions\nhave ruled that issues of proper funding of defender offices are justiciable, and that\nthe courts have the authority to address and if necessary order remedies for\nsystemic deficiencies in indigent defense programs. See, e.g., Public Defender,\nEleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida, 115 So.3d at 271-74; State v. Quitman Cnty,\n807 So.2d 401, 409-10 (Miss. 2001).\nMandamus provides an appropriate and necessary alternative to the Sixth\nAmendment remedy under the Civil Rights Act.\nCONCLUSION\nCourts have the duty to protect constitutional and statutory rights when the\npolitical process has failed to secure and implement these rights, as has been and\ncontinues to be the case in Luzerne County. The County’s indigent defendants are\nconstitutionally entitled to a system that provides a lawyer in more than name only.\nAside from the obvious public policy reasons, ensuring effective legal\nrepresentation for indigent defendants is a constitutional and statutory requirement.\nThis Court should reverse and remand this matter to the Court of Common Pleas\nfor discovery and trial on the constitutional and mandamus claims for relief.\n51\n\nDated: September 10, 2015 Respectfully submitted,\n/s/ David Rudovsky\nDavid Rudovsky (Pa.

Lawton (collectively \nCounty) to their amended complaint.  The amended complaint asserts that, due to \ninadequate funding, the Office of Public Defender of Luzerne County is unable to \nrepresent indigent clients adequately, thereby depriving those clients of their right \nto counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  The trial court sustained the \nCounty’s objections that the plaintiffs lacked standing, for separate reasons, and \nthat the complaint failed to state a cause of action.  The trial court overruled the \nCounty’s objection that the plaintiffs should have joined the current Chief Public \nDefender as an indispensable party.  The County cross-appeals the trial court’s \ndenial of its motion to disqualify an attorney representing the plaintiffs on the basis \nof her alleged ethics violations. \nBackground \nOn April 10, 2012, Al Flora, Jr., in his official capacity as acting \nChief Public Defender of Luzerne County, and three indigent criminal defendants \nfiled a class action complaint against the County for depriving the three indigent \ncriminal defendants of their right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the \nUnited  States  Constitution  and  Article  1,  Section  9  of  the  Pennsylvania \nConstitution.  The complaint was amended on May 15, 2013, inter alia, to aver \nthat Flora was suing in his individual capacity because he was no longer employed \nby the County as Chief Public Defender.  It also replaced the original indigent \ncriminal defendant plaintiffs with Joshua Lozano,1 Kuren and Allabaugh (Indigent \n                                           \n1 Joshua Lozano was named in the amended complaint as a potential class representative but he \nis not a party to this appeal. \n\nClients) as representatives of a class comprised of “all indigent adults in Luzerne \nCounty who are or will be represented by the Office of the Public Defender from \nthis point until the Office of the Public Defender has the funding and resources \nnecessary  to  enable  it  to  meet  ethical,  legal,  and  constitutional  standards  of \nrepresentation.”  Amended Complaint, ¶4; Reproduced Record at 851a-52a (R.R. \n__).  \nThe amended complaint asserted that the Office of Public Defender, \nas  currently  funded,  cannot  provide  adequate  legal  representation  to  indigent \ncriminal  defendants.    The  amended  complaint  generally  alleged  that  public \ndefenders carry caseloads that exceed the standard recommended by the American \nBar Association; lack basic office resources such as individual desks and phone \nlines; and lack sufficient support staff.  More specifically, the amended complaint \nalleged  that  public  defenders  are  unable  to  provide  representation  at  most \npreliminary  arraignments  and  often  must  request  continuances  of  critical \nproceedings, leading to longer incarcerations than might be otherwise necessary.  \nAmended Complaint, ¶¶48-49, 53-54; R.R. 865a-67a.  It further alleged that public \ndefenders  in  Luzerne  County  are  unable  to  prepare  properly  for  their  clients’ \ndefense or to consult with them in confidence.  Amended Complaint, ¶¶61-70; \nR.R. 869-872.  The amended complaint requested the following relief: \n[a] writ of mandamus and permanent injunction compelling [the \nCounty] to provide necessary funding to allow the [Office of \nPublic Defender] to hire additional trial attorneys and support \nstaff  as  well  as  upgrade  the  physical  and  technological \nresources such that the [Office of Public Defender] is capable of \nproviding  representation  to  all  qualified  indigent  defendants \nprosecuted in Luzerne County that satisfies standards set by the \nU.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. \n2 \n \n\nAmended  Complaint,  Prayer  for  Relief  ¶1;  R.R.  885a.    Notably,  the  amended \ncomplaint alleged that Flora had attempted numerous times to obtain additional \nresources  from  the  County  through  the  normal  budgetary  process.    Amended \nComplaint,  ¶¶29-37;  R.R.  858a-61a.    However,  his  requests  were  denied.    In \nresponse, Flora adopted a policy in December 2011 that limited the clients of the \nOffice of Public Defender to those defendants charged with homicide or felony sex \noffenses or who are facing extradition.  Amended Complaint, ¶33; R.R. 860a. \nWith  their  complaint,  the  plaintiffs  filed  a  request  for  preliminary \ninjunction, and this was granted on June 15, 2012, after a hearing.  The trial court \nordered the County to provide funding for unfilled vacancies within the Office of \nPublic  Defender  and  to  provide  office  space  adequate  to  allow  confidential \ncommunication between public defenders and their clients.  Additionally, the trial \ncourt ordered the County to appoint a lawyer to represent each of the original \nindigent  criminal  defendant  plaintiffs,  who  had  been  deprived  counsel  under \nFlora’s  December  2011  policy,  and  ordered  Flora  to  discontinue  that  policy.  \nFinally,  the  trial  court  ordered  the  parties  into  mediation,  which  proved \nunsuccessful.  \nOn April 17, 2013, the County dismissed Flora and appointed a new \nChief Public Defender.2  On May 31, 2013, the County removed the amended \ncomplaint  to  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Middle  District  of \nPennsylvania, but the case was remanded to the trial court on August 16, 2013. \n                                           \n2 Flora filed an action in federal court alleging retaliation claims under state and federal law and \nseeking reinstatement as Chief Public Defender.  The action was dismissed. Flora is appealing \nthe dismissal of the federal claim and will refile his state law claims in the trial court. \n3 \n \n\nOn September 11, 2013, the County filed preliminary objections to the \namended  complaint  and  a  motion  to  disqualify  one  of  the  Indigent  Clients’ \nattorneys, Mary Catherine Roper, Esq.  The trial court held a hearing on October 8, \n2013, on both issues.  Regarding the motion to disqualify, the parties stipulated to \nseveral facts, specifically that Roper: (1) met with the Indigent Clients individually \nin April 2013 knowing that some of them were represented by public defenders in \ntheir criminal cases, (2) did not inform the public defenders that she was meeting \nwith their clients and (3) brought retainer or fee agreements to the meetings that \nwere executed afterwards. \nOn October 21, 2013, the trial court denied the County’s motion to \ndisqualify Roper.  On October 22, 2013, the trial court sustained several of the \nCounty’s  preliminary  objections  and  dismissed  the  amended  complaint.  \nSpecifically, the trial court held that both Flora and the Indigent Clients lacked \nstanding and that the amended complaint failed to state a cause of action.  The trial \ncourt also held that the current Chief Public Defender is not an indispensable party.  \nFlora and the Indigent Clients have appealed the order sustaining the County’s \npreliminary objections, and the County has cross-appealed the denial of its motion \nto disqualify Roper.  \nOn appeal,3 Flora and the Indigent Clients raise two issues.  First, they \ncontend  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  holding  that  Flora  lacked  standing  in  his \n                                           \n3 In reviewing a trial court’s grant of preliminary objections, this Court’s standard of review is de \nnovo and the scope of review is plenary.  Mazur v. Trinity Area School District, 961 A.2d 96, \n101 (Pa. 2008).  The court must accept as true all well-pleaded, material, and relevant facts \nalleged in the complaint and every inference that is fairly deducible from those facts.   Id.  \nPreliminary objections should be sustained only when, based on the facts pleaded, it is clear and \nfree from doubt that the complainant will be unable to prove facts legally sufficient to establish a \nright to relief.  Id. \n4 \n \n\nindividual capacity.  Second, they argue that the Indigent Clients have standing to \nallege a deprivation of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel before a deprivation \nhas actually occurred.  On cross-appeal,4 the County argues that Attorney Roper \nviolated  several  rules  of  professional  conduct  and  that  the  trial  court  erred  in \nrefusing to disqualify her. \nFlora’s Standing \nWe consider, first, whether Flora has standing to pursue his claim that \nthe Office of Public Defender is inadequately funded.  The plaintiffs contend that \nFlora has standing under the traditional standing test and also as a taxpayer under \nApplication of Biester, 409 A.2d 848 (Pa. 1979).   \nTo have standing, a party must establish “that he has a substantial, \ndirect,  and  immediate  interest  in  the  outcome  of  the  litigation.”    Pittsburgh \nPalisades Park, LLC v. Commonwealth, 888 A.2d 655, 660 (Pa. 2005).  An interest \nis “substantial” if the party’s interest “surpasses the common interest of all citizens \nin procuring obedience to the law.”  Id.  A “direct” interest requires a showing of a \ncausal connection between the matter complained of and the party’s interest.  Id.  \nFinally, an “immediate” interest requires the causal connection to not be remote or \nspeculative.  Id.  The key is that the person must be “negatively impacted in some \nreal and direct fashion.”  Id. \nThe plaintiffs argue that Flora is “aggrieved” under the traditional \nstanding  test  because  “his  right  to  bring  a  mandamus  suit  was  deliberately \nfrustrated  by  a  discharge  he  contends  is  retaliatory.”    Plaintiffs’  Brief  at  55.  \nTherefore, they argue that Flora should be permitted to continue as a plaintiff \n                                           \n4 This Court exercises plenary review of a trial court’s disposition of an attorney disqualification \nmotion.  Vertical Resources, Inc. v. Bramlett, 837 A.2d 1193, 1201 (Pa. Super. 2003). \n5 \n \n\nunless and until the federal court rules on his retaliation claims.  They also contend \nthat the trial court erred in relying upon Bradford Timbers v. H. Gordon Roberts, \n654 A.2d 625 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995).  Plaintiffs argue that Ambron v. Philadelphia \nCivil  Service  Commission,  458  A.2d  1055  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  1983),  is  a  more \napplicable precedent because it dealt with the standing of a plaintiff challenging his \nremoval, as is the case with Flora. \nIn  Bradford  Timbers,  a  district  justice  petitioned  for  a  writ  of \nmandamus to compel the county to make a clerical appointment to his personal \nstaff.  After the district justice filed his petition, our Supreme Court suspended \nhim.  This Court held that the district justice lacked standing to proceed with his \nmandamus action because he no longer had the authority to carry out the act he \nsought to compel.  Bradford Timbers, 654 A.2d at 626.  In Ambron, four police \ndetectives  challenged  their  transfer  from  the  district  attorney’s  office  to  the \nPhiladelphia  police  department.    After  three  of  the  four  officers  resigned,  the \ncomplaint was challenged as moot.  This Court held that because the plaintiffs \nwere “not incapable of reinstatement,” their claims were not moot.  Ambron, 458 \nA.2d at 1056.   \nAs the trial court noted, Flora was once Chief Public Defender and \nmay succeed in challenging his termination as retaliatory.  However, he currently \nhas no right to manage the Office of Public Defender in any way whatsoever.  In \nBradford  Timbers,  this  Court  held  that  the  suspended  district  justice  lacked \nstanding even though his removal was temporary.  The case is stronger, here, \nbecause  Flora’s  removal  from  office  is  permanent.    Ambron  is  distinguishable \nbecause Flora’s potential reinstatement is not an issue in the present litigation.  We \ntherefore agree with the trial court’s reliance on Bradford Timbers. \n6 \n \n\nWe conclude that Flora lacks traditional standing because he is not \npersonally aggrieved by the County’s alleged failure to fund the Office of Public \nDefender adequately.  He is not directly impacted by the County’s actions any \nmore than other individual citizens.  As a result, his interest is not substantial, \ndirect, or immediate.   \nAlternatively,  the  plaintiffs  argue  that  Flora  has  taxpayer  standing \nunder Biester, which created an exception to the traditional standing requirements.  \nUnder  this  exception,  a  taxpayer,  even  one  not  personally  aggrieved,  may \nchallenge a governmental action provided he satisfies the following requirements: \n(1) the governmental action would otherwise go unchallenged, (2) those directly \nand  immediately  affected  by  the  complained  of  expenditures  are  beneficially \naffected and not inclined to challenge the action, (3) judicial relief is appropriate, \n(4) redress through other channels is unavailable, and  (5) no other persons are \nbetter  situated  to  assert  the  claim.    Consumer  Party  of  Pennsylvania  v. \nCommonwealth, 507 A.2d 323, 329 (Pa. 1986), abrogated on other grounds by \nPennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 877 \nA.2d 383 (Pa. 2005).  All the conditions must be satisfied for a taxpayer to have \nstanding. \nThe plaintiffs argue that Flora satisfies the first Biester requirement \nbecause the County  could dismiss any Chief Public Defender  who attempts to \naddress the alleged funding deficiencies to the Office.  Second, they argue that the \npublic defenders and their clients will be benefited by the lawsuit, and they are \neither unable or unlikely to bring litigation due to the County’s past firing of Flora.  \nThird, the plaintiffs contend that judicial relief is particularly appropriate in the \npresent case because it involves constitutional questions.  Fourth, they argue that \n7 \n \n\nrelief through other channels is unavailable because, again, the County can stop the \nChief Public Defender from filing a lawsuit by firing him.  They also note that \nFlora spent two years lobbying the County for additional resources before filing \nthe current lawsuit.  Finally, the plaintiffs contend that a decision by the Chief \nPublic Defender to bring a lawsuit similar to the present one would be “futile” \nbecause the County would fire him to prevent the lawsuit from going forward.  In \nany case, because the current Chief Public Defender has not acted, Flora should be \npermitted to proceed with this action to fulfill the intent of Biester. \nThe County responds that Flora lacks standing under Biester because \nrelief is available through other channels.  The current Chief Public Defender may \nbring a claim under the Public Defender Act5 or seek to have attorneys appointed \non a case-by-case basis.  Individual indigent criminal defendants may obtain relief \nunder the Post Conviction Relief Act6 should they receive ineffective assistance of \ncounsel in their criminal trials. \n  The trial court did not err in holding that Flora lacks standing under \nBiester.  First,  whether the County has provided the Indigent Clients  effective \nassistance of  counsel  will be  addressed in their criminal  cases.    Likewise,  the \ncurrent  Chief  Public  Defender  may  challenge  the  County’s  actions.    See,  e.g., \nDauphin County Public Defender’s Office v. Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin \nCounty, 849 A.2d 1145, 1148 (Pa. 2004) (holding that public defender has standing \nto challenge administrative order which affects statutory obligation “to provide \nlegal representation to financially eligible criminal defendants”).  Redress is also \navailable through the regular budgetary process.  The plaintiffs’ primary argument \n                                           \n5 Act of December 2, 1968, P.L. 1144, as amended, 16 P.S. §§9960.1-9960.13. \n6 42 Pa. C.S. §§9541–9546. \n8 \n \n\nis that the County will dismiss a Chief Public Defender who files a lawsuit, but this \nis speculation.  Notably, if Flora is successful in his retaliation claim against the \nCounty and is reinstated, he can then bring a lawsuit in his official capacity.   \nIn sum, we hold that Flora lacks standing in his individual capacity \nand the trial court properly sustained the County’s preliminary objection on this \nground. \nIndigent Clients’ Standing/Failure to State a Claim \nNext, we consider whether the trial court erred in finding that the \nIndigent  Clients  lacked  standing.    They  argue  that  they  adequately  pled  a \nconstructive denial of counsel claim in the amended complaint, which alleges that \nthe County’s public defenders are unable to:  interview or meet with clients prior to \npreliminary  hearings;  contact  clients  between  court  appearances;  conduct \nmeaningful  investigation  or  discovery;  engage  in  motion  practice;  gather  the \ninformation  needed  to  do  effective  plea  negotiations;  engage  in  sufficient  trial \npreparation;  or  properly  litigate  appeals  due  to  lack  of  experience.    Amended \nComplaint,  ¶106,  R.R.  881a.    Because  they  have  been  constructively  denied \ncounsel, the Indigent Clients believe they have a substantial, direct, and immediate \ninterest in the resources provided to the Office of Public Defender.  They explain \nthat their action does not seek to alter how the Chief Public Defender allocates the \nresources available to him, but rather to compel the County to provide sufficient \nresources to satisfy its statutory and constitutional obligations.  Additionally, the \nIndigent Clients contend that the amended complaint raises an actual denial of \ncounsel  claim  because  the  Office  of  Public  Defender  does  not  provide \nrepresentation at preliminary arraignments, the point in the criminal process where \nthe right to counsel attaches. \n9 \n \n\nThe County counters that none of the Indigent Clients have yet been \nconvicted and, therefore, have not suffered any prejudice.  In addition, the County \nargues that mandamus relief is not available because the Indigent Clients seek to \ncompel the appropriation of additional funds for the Office of Public Defender, \nwhich  is  a  discretionary  act.    Finally,  the  County  contends  that  the  amended \ncomplaint’s allegations that its public defenders will not devote sufficient time to \ntheir  representation  do  not  give  rise  to  a  claim  for  either  an  actual  denial  or \nconstructive denial of counsel. \nThe argument on standing merges with the question of whether the \namended complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Accordingly, \nwe decide the two issues together. \nRight to Counsel \nThe Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that \n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the \nAssistance of Counsel for his defence.”  U.S. CONST. amend. VI.  The United \nStates  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  states  must  provide  indigent  criminal \ndefendants with appointed counsel.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).  \nThe right to counsel attaches once the criminal defendant is actually charged at a \npreliminary  arraignment.    Montejo  v.  Louisiana,  556  U.S.  778,  786  (2009).  \nTherefore, an indigent criminal defendant who does not receive appointed counsel \nmay bring an actual denial of counsel claim.  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. \n648, 659 (1984). \nAppointed  counsel  must  provide  effective  representation.    If  an \nindigent  criminal  defendant’s  appointed  lawyer  is  ineffective,  the  defendant  is \nentitled to a new trial.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984).  \n10 \n \n\nUnder Strickland, a defendant must prove that his attorney performed below a \nstandard of objective reasonableness and that counsel’s performance resulted in \nactual prejudice to the defendant.  Id.  An ineffective assistance of counsel claim \nmay be brought only after the defendant has been convicted.  See id. \nIn  Cronic, 466  U.S.  648,  decided the  same  day  as  Strickland,  the \nSupreme Court noted that there are some cases where  \nthe  likelihood  that  any  lawyer,  even  a  fully  competent  one, \ncould provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption \nof  prejudice  is  appropriate  without  inquiry  into  the  actual \nconduct of the trial.   \nCronic, 466 U.S. at 659-60.  In Cronic, the defendant’s retained counsel withdrew \nweeks before the case went to trial.  His newly appointed counsel was a young \nlawyer with a real estate practice who had 25 days to prepare for the complex fraud \ncase that had taken the government over four years to prepare.  Nevertheless, the \nSupreme Court held that these facts were not sufficient to establish a presumption \nof prejudice.  Instead, the Court cited Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), as \nan example of where a presumption of prejudice will be shown.  In Powell, the \ndefendant’s counsel was from out-of-state and did not know the local rules of court \nor even the facts of the case.  In these circumstances, the Supreme Court held that \nit can be presumed that the criminal defendant is prejudiced and, effectively, has \nbeen denied counsel.   \nNotably, both Strickland and Cronic were criminal appeals where the \ndefendants  were  seeking  to  overturn  their  convictions;  they  did  not  seek \nprospective relief. \n \n \n11 \n \n\nConstructive Denial of Counsel \nThe Indigent Clients ask this Court to recognize a new civil remedy to \nimprove funding to a public defender’s office.  In Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 \n(11th Cir. 1988), the first case to recognize such a remedy, a class of indigent \ncriminal defendants in Georgia sought to require state government to provide the \nfunding for their defense.  After the dismissal of the case, the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reversed, reasoning that a criminal defendant’s “lack of counsel” \nclaims might not rise to the level of “ineffective assistance” but the defendants \ncould  still  suffer  harm.    Nevertheless,  the  court  held  that  criminal  defendants \nasserting that they will suffer from a lack of meaningful representation in the future \nmust show a likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury and the \ninadequacy  of  a  remedy  at  law  to  proceed.    Luckey  was  never  litigated  to \ncompletion because it was dismissed on grounds of abstention.  Luckey v. Miller, \n976 F.2d 673 (11th Cir. 1992). \nThe New York Court of Appeals considered a constructive denial of \ncounsel  claim  in  Hurrell-Harring  v.  New  York,  930  N.E.2d  217  (N.Y.  2010).  \nThere, several indigent criminal defendants brought a civil action asserting that \nthey had been constructively denied their constitutional right to counsel because of \nthe inadequate funding of several county public defender’s offices.  In a 4 to 3 \ndecision, the New York Court of Appeals allowed the case to proceed and reversed \nthe lower court’s dismissal.  The court reasoned that Strickland’s holding that a \ndefendant must be convicted before he brings an ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim was premised on the supposition that Gideon was being faithfully applied by \nthe states.  The question decided in Strickland was “not [] whether ineffectiveness \nhas  assumed  systemic  dimensions,  but  rather  []  whether  the  State  has  met  its \n12 \n \n\nfoundational obligation under Gideon to provide legal representation.”  Id. at 222.  \nThe New York Court of Appeals noted that the complaint alleged that appointed \ncounsel  served  in  name  only  because  they  were  chronically  unavailable, \nunresponsive to urgent inquiries, waived important rights without consulting their \nclients, missed court appearances, and appeared in court unprepared to proceed.  \nId.  These allegations, the New York court held, “raise serious questions as to \nwhether any [attorney-client] relationship may be really said to have existed.”  Id. \nat 224.  Thus, the court distinguished Strickland.  The New York Court of Appeals \nallowed the case to proceed, but it has not been litigated to judgment. \nSimilarly, in Duncan v. Michigan, 774 N.W.2d 89 (Mich. Ct. App. \n2009), aff'd on other grounds 780 N.W.2d 843 (Mich. 2010),7 a class of indigent \ncriminal  defendants  challenged  the  funding  to  several  county  public  defender \noffices as so inadequate as to violate the Sixth Amendment.  Specifically, the \nplaintiffs alleged that the county systems were “wholly lacking” regarding client \neligibility  standards;  attorney  hiring,  training  and  retention  programs;  written \nperformance  and  workload  standards;  monitoring  and  supervision  of  appointed \ncounsel; conflict of interest guidelines; and independence from the judiciary and \nprosecutorial offices.  Id. at 99.  The Michigan Court of Appeals noted that the \nallegations  in  the  complaint  were  detailed  on  specific  instances  of  inadequate \n                                           \n7 The appellate history of Duncan is complex.  Initially, the Michigan Supreme Court on April \n30, 2010, vacated and remanded in part and affirmed in part the Court of Appeals’ decision.  \nRegarding the constructive denial of counsel issue, the Supreme Court stated that “[t]his case is \nat its earliest stages and, based solely on the plaintiffs’ pleadings in this case, it is premature to \nmake a decision on the substantive issues.”  Duncan, 780 N.W.2d 843, 844 (Mich. 2010).  \nTherefore, the Court held that summary disposition was inappropriate.  The Court subsequently \ngranted and vacated several reconsideration orders.  Ultimately, the court reinstated its original \nApril 30th order.  Duncan, 790 N.W.2d 695 (Mich. 2010) (“[W]e REINSTATE our order in this \ncase dated April 30, 2010, because reconsideration thereof was improperly granted.”). \n13 \n \n\nrepresentation, limited interaction between the public defenders and their clients \nand waivers of client rights by counsel. \nIn a 2 to 1 decision, the Michigan Court of Appeals explained, first, \nthat mandamus was available to compel governmental action because the plaintiffs \nwere not seeking to compel an appropriation but, rather, to compel the state to \nprovide  adequate  representation.    The  court  acknowledged  that  funding  and \nlegislation “would seemingly appear to be the measures needed to be taken to \ncorrect constitutional violations,” but stated that “we are not prepared to rule on the \nissue whether the trial court has the authority to order appropriations, legislation, \nor comparable steps.”  Id. at 111.  The court allowed the case to proceed to allow \nplaintiffs the opportunity to show the    \nexistence  of  widespread  and  systemic  instances  of  actual  or \nconstructive  denial  of  counsel  and  instances  of  deficient \nperformance by counsel, which instances may have varied and \nrelevant  levels  of  egregiousness,  all  causally  connected  to \ndefendants’ conduct.   \nId. at 124.  The court rejected the argument that post-conviction relief, as set forth \nin Strickland, provided the exclusive and proper remedy.  The case has not been \nlitigated to judgment.  \nThe  dissents  in  Hurrell-Harring  and  Duncan  are  also  worthy  of \nreview.  The dissenting judge in Hurrell-Harring reasoned that inadequacies in the \npublic defender system do not constitute a Sixth Amendment claim.  The dissent \nnoted that “[c]onstructive denial of counsel is a branch from the Strickland tree, \nwith  Cronic  applying  only  when  the  appointed  attorney’s  representation  is  so \negregious that it’s as if [the] defendant had no attorney at all.”  Hurrell-Harring, \n930 N.E.2d at 229 (Pigott, J., dissenting).  The dissent concluded that “[p]laintiffs’ \n14 \n \n\nmere lumping together of 20 generic ineffective assistance of counsel claims into \none civil pleading does not ipso facto transform it into one alleging a systemic \ndenial of the right to counsel.”  Id. at 230 (Pigott, J., dissenting).  \nIn Duncan, the dissenting judge concluded that the relief sought by \nthe plaintiffs would violate separation of powers because they  \nsought  in  their  complaint  to  have  the  judiciary  override  the \nMichigan system of local control and funding of legal services \nfor indigent criminal defendants.   \nDuncan, 774 N.W.2d at 153-54 (Whitbeck, J., dissenting).  Because the plaintiffs \nhad not yet been convicted, they had not suffered prejudice, which is necessary to \npursue a Sixth Amendment claim.  The plaintiffs’ right to pursue an ineffective \nassistance  of  counsel  claim  post-conviction,  under  Strickland,  provided  an \nadequate  remedy.    This  made  mandamus  or  injunctive  relief  inappropriate.  \nFinally, the dissent noted that the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee criminal \ndefendants an attorney of a particular level of skill.  \nIn the present case, the trial court explained that Hurrell-Harring was \ndistinguishable because the New York court was “reviewing an alleged outright \ndenial of legal counsel (not effective assistance)” at points in the criminal process \nwhere counsel was required.  Trial Court op. at 11.  By contrast, the amended \ncomplaint alleged that some indigent criminal defendants did not have counsel at \ntheir preliminary arraignment, which is a point in the criminal process before the \nright to counsel attaches.  This made the claims of the Indigent Clients different \nfrom those of the plaintiffs in Hurrell-Harring.  Accordingly, the real question \nraised by the amended complaint was not a denial of counsel but, rather, a denial of \neffective counsel.  The trial court concluded that whether counsel was ineffective \ncan only be determined after the criminal proceedings have ended. \n15 \n \n\nWe find persuasive and so accept the analyses of the dissenting judges \nin Hurrell-Harring and Duncan and reject as not persuasive the majority opinions \nin those cases.  We do so for several reasons. \nFirst, there is no precedent from the United States Supreme Court \nacknowledging that a constructive denial of counsel claim may be brought in a \ncivil case that seeks prospective relief in the form of more funding and resources to \nan entire office, as opposed to relief to individual indigent criminal defendants.  \nStrickland, Cronic, and Gideon were all cases where the defendants sought a new \ntrial.  As explained in the Duncan dissent, the “United States Supreme Court in \nGideon and Strickland was concerned with results, not process.  It did not presume \nto tell the states how to ensure that indigent criminal defendants receive effective \nassistance of counsel.”  Duncan, 774 N.W.2d at 153 (Whitbeck, J., dissenting).  It \nis unclear that such a claim will be held cognizable in any state. \nSecond, even assuming, arguendo, that a Sixth Amendment claim for \nmore funding to the public defender’s office is cognizable, the amended complaint \ndoes  not  satisfy  the  requisite  standard.    The  amended  complaint  alleges  that \nattorneys  from  the  Office  of  Public  Defender  meet  only  briefly  with  indigent \nclients, rarely contact clients between court appearances, do not conduct significant \ninvestigation or discovery, do not engage in sufficient trial preparation, and cannot \nproperly litigate appeals due to lack of experience.  Amended Complaint, ¶106, \nR.R. 881a.  These allegations do not create circumstances that are “so likely [to \ncreate prejudice] that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.”  \nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 692.  Notably, constructive denial of counsel was not found \nin Cronic where the lawyer assigned to the complex white collar criminal case was \n16 \n \n\nnew to the profession, did real estate law and was appointed 25 days before the \ntrial for which the government had prepared for four years.   \nThe amended complaint does not allege facts to support the inference \nthat the Indigent Clients have or will suffer irreparable harm, but only the fear that \nthey will not be adequately represented.  This is speculation, a deficiency in the \npleading that cannot be cured by amendment.  Kennedy v. Carlson, 544 N.W.2d 1, \n6-8 (Minn. 1996) (holding that public defender’s claims were too speculative and \nhypothetical to pursue a denial of effective assistance of counsel).  We agree with \nthe  Hurrell-Harring  dissent  that  the  “mere  lumping  together  of  20  generic \nineffective assistance of counsel claims into one civil pleading does not ipso facto \ntransform it into one alleging a systemic denial of the right to counsel.”  Hurrell-\nHarring, 930 N.E.2d at 230 (Pigott, J., dissenting). \nThird, as noted by the Supreme Court in Strickland, “[r]epresentation \nis an art, and an act or omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or \neven brilliant in another.”  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693.  Indeed, “the purpose of the \neffective  assistance  guarantee  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  is  not  to  improve  the \nquality of legal representation, although that is a goal of considerable importance \nto the legal system.  The purpose is simply to ensure that criminal defendants \nreceive a fair trial.”  Id. at 689 (emphasis added).  These observations compel our \ndisposition of the instant appeal.  Criminal defendants are guaranteed effective \nassistance  of  counsel  so  that  they  receive  a  fair  trial;  they  are  not  guaranteed \nperfect counsel or a perfect trial.  Accordingly, we will not infer a presumption of \nprejudice in the present case.   \n17 \n \n\nShould the  legal  representation  assigned  to  the  individual  Indigent \nClients prove ineffective and cause them prejudice, their recourse is to bring a \npost-conviction Strickland claim. \nMandamus \nMandamus  is  an  extraordinary  remedy  used  to  compel  the \nperformance of a ministerial act or mandatory duty.  Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC \nv. Golden, 35 A.3d 1277, 1280 n.7 (Pa. 2012).  Mandamus requires a showing that: \n(1) the petitioner has a clear legal right to relief, (2) the official owes the petitioner \na  duty,  and  (3)  there  are  no  other  adequate  remedies  at  law.    Wilson  v. \nPennsylvania  Board  of  Probation  &  Parole, 942  A.2d 270,  272  (Pa.  Cmwlth. \n2008).  The essence of an action in mandamus is that a specific actor has a non-\ndiscretionary duty to perform a particular act.  Finn v. Rendell, 990 A.2d 100, 106 \n(Pa.  Cmwlth.  2010).    Similarly,  because  a  mandatory  injunction  compels  a \ndefendant to perform an act, rather than to refrain from acting, courts will grant a \nmandatory injunction only upon a very strong showing that the plaintiff has a clear \nright  to  relief.    Department  of  Public  Welfare  v.  Portnoy,  566  A.2d  336  (Pa. \nCmwlth. 1989). \nHere, the amended complaint does not present a clear right to relief.  \nThe  Indigent  Clients  have  an  alternative  remedy  either  through  a  claim  under \nStrickland or the Post Conviction Relief Act.  Similarly, the Chief Public Defender \nmay seek relief under the Public Defender Act, which authorizes him to  \narrange for and make use of the services of attorneys at law \nadmitted to practice before the Supreme and Superior Courts of \nthis  Commonwealth  and  the  court  of  common  pleas  of  the \ncounty  or  counties  in  which  they  may  serve,  when  such \nattorneys volunteer to act as assistants, without compensation, \nto enable him to carry out the duties of his office.   \n18 \n \n\n16 P.S. §9960.5. \nThe amended complaint seeks the appropriation of additional funding \nto the Office of Public Defender to hire additional lawyers and staff.  The County \ncounters  that  its  funding  of  the  Office  of  Public  Defender  is  inherently \ndiscretionary and cannot be compelled by a writ of mandamus.  We agree with the \nCounty.   \nIn addition, the writ of mandamus sought in the amended complaint \nmay violate the doctrine of separation of powers.  Our system of government is \nbased  on  the  concept  that  the  legislative,  executive  and  judicial  branches  of \ngovernment are independent and co-equal with each other.  Commonwealth ex rel. \nCarroll  v.  Tate,  274  A.2d  193,  196  (Pa.  1971).    Accordingly,  no  branch  of \ngovernment may exercise the function committed to another branch.  Wilson v. \nPhiladelphia School Districts, 195 A. 90, 93 (Pa. 1937).  Nevertheless, in rare \ncircumstances  one  branch  of  government  may  prevent  another  branch  from \nusurping the powers committed to the other branches.  Beckert v. Warren, 439 \nA.2d 638, 642 (Pa. 1981). \nThe judicial power, for example, is vested exclusively in the courts, \nand the taxing and spending powers are vested in the legislature.  Id. at 642-43.  As \na “check,” however, the courts may “compel expenditures necessary to prevent the \nimpairment  of  [the  court’s]  exercise  of  the  judicial  power  or  of  the  proper \nadministration  of  justice.”    Id.  at  642.    Therefore,  in  limited  and  exceptional \ncircumstances,  the  courts  may  order  an  appropriation  of  funds  when  the \nlegislature’s  funding  makes  it  impossible  for  the  judiciary  to  comply  with  its \nstatutory and constitutional obligations.  Id. at 643.  Specifically, our Supreme \nCourt has held that in such a case,  \n19 \n \n\n[t]here must be a genuine threat to the administration of justice, \nthat is, a nexus between the legislative act and the injury to the \njudiciary,  not  merely  a  theoretical  encroachment  by  the \nlegislature.   \nId.    Stated  otherwise,  the  lack  of  an  appropriation  must,  itself,  be  an \nunconstitutional  omission.    “Absent  such  circumstances,  the  courts  are  not \nempowered to review discretionary acts of the legislature.”  Id.8 \nThe amended complaint did not allege facts to show such an extreme \nrefusal of the County to appropriate funds.  The Indigent Clients’ right to relief is \nfar  from  clear.    The  County  has  provided  indigent  criminal  defendants  with \ncounsel.  Simply stated, the appropriation of additional funds to the Office of \nPublic  Defender  is  a  discretionary  act  that  cannot  be  compelled  by  a  writ  of \nmandamus. \nActual Denial of Counsel \nWe next consider whether the amended complaint has pled an actual \ndenial of counsel claim.  Paragraph 53 of the amended complaint states: \n[t]he  [Office  of  Public  Defender]  is  unable  to  provide \nrepresentation  or  support  at  most  preliminary  arraignments, \nwhich the U.S. Supreme Court recently reaffirmed to be the \npoint at which the right to counsel attaches.  See Rothgery v. \nGillespie  County,  554  U.S.  191,  213  (2008)  (“[A]  criminal \ndefendant’s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where \nhe learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to \nrestriction,  marks  the  start  of  adversary  judicial  proceedings \n                                           \n8 Courts may compel additional funding if the appropriated amount is inadequate to comply with \nstatutory or constitutional obligations.  See Kistler v. Carbon County, 35 A.2d 733, 735 (Pa. \nSuper. 1944) (holding that county commissioners cannot “limit or avoid liabilities imposed upon \nthe  county  by  the  Constitution  or  by  statutes”).    The  “administration  of  justice”  must  be \nconstrued more broadly than involving just the courts.  Related entities, such as the Office of \nPublic Defender, also participate in the administration of justice. \n20 \n \n\nthat  trigger  attachment  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to \ncounsel.”)    The  right  to  counsel  under  the  Pennsylvania \nConstitution attaches at the same time as the right to counsel \nprovided by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution.   Commonwealth  v.  Arroyo,  723  A.2d 162, 170 \n(Pa. 1999). \nAmended Complaint, ¶53; R.R. 866a.  The plaintiffs argue that this allegation \nraises an actual denial of counsel claim. \nThe United States Supreme Court has  established that the right to \ncounsel  attaches  at  the  preliminary  arraignment,  which  is  the  point  that  the \ndefendant enters the criminal prosecutorial system.  Montejo, 556 U.S. at 786.  \nUnder Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 540, several events occur at a \npreliminary arraignment.  The criminal defendant is presented with a copy of the \ncriminal complaint and, if the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant, a copy \nof  the  warrant  and  supporting  affidavits.    PA.  R.CRIM.P.  540(C),  (D).9    The \ndefendant is read the complaint and informed of his right to counsel, including the \nright to have counsel assigned; the right to a preliminary hearing; and the type and \nconditions of release on bail, if applicable.  PA. R.CRIM.P. 540(F).  The defendant \nis not questioned about the charges.  Id.  Finally, a date for the preliminary hearing \nis determined, unless the right to the preliminary hearing is waived by a defendant \n                                           \n9 They state: \n(C)  At the preliminary arraignment, a copy of the complaint accepted for filing \npursuant to Rule 508 shall be given to the defendant. \n(D)  If the defendant was arrested with a warrant, the issuing authority shall \nprovide the defendant with copies of the warrant and supporting affidavit(s) at the \npreliminary arraignment, unless the warrant and affidavit(s) are not available at \nthat time, in which event the defendant shall be given copies no later than the first \nbusiness day after the preliminary arraignment. \nPA. R.CRIM.P. 540(C), (D). \n21 \n \n\nrepresented by counsel.  PA. R.CRIM.P. 540(G).  After the preliminary arraignment, \nthe defendant is given the opportunity to post bail, secure counsel, and notify \nothers of the arrest.  PA. R.CRIM.P. 540(H). \nThe right to counsel attaches at the preliminary arraignment, but the \ndefendant does not have a right to counsel to represent him at the preliminary \narraignment.  In Rothgery, the case cited in the amended complaint, the United \nStates Supreme Court held that  \n[o]nce attachment occurs, the accused at least is entitled to the \npresence of appointed counsel during any ‘critical stage’ of the \npostattachment proceedings; what makes a stage critical is what \nshows the need for counsel’s presence.  Thus, counsel must be \nappointed within a reasonable time after attachment to allow \nfor adequate representation at any critical stage before trial, as \nwell as at trial itself.   \nRothgery, 554 U.S. at 212 (emphasis added).  Justice Alito in a concurring opinion \nfurther  explained  that  the  Court  has  “rejected  the  argument  that  the  Sixth \nAmendment entitles the criminal defendant to the assistance of appointed counsel \nat a probable-cause hearing.”  Rothgery, 554 U.S. at 216 (Alito, J., concurring).  \nRather, the Sixth Amendment requires “the appointment of counsel only after the \ndefendant’s prosecution has begun, and then only as necessary to guarantee the \ndefendant effective assistance at trial.”  Id. at 217 (Alito, J., concurring). \nPennsylvania’s  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure  governing  the \nappointment of counsel in criminal cases conform to Rothgery.  Rule 122 states \nthat counsel shall be appointed “in all court cases, prior to the preliminary hearing \nto all defendants who are without financial resources or who are otherwise unable \nto employ counsel.”  PA. R.CRIM.P. 122(A)(2) (emphasis added).  At a preliminary \narraignment, the defendant is advised of the charges against him, given a copy of \n22 \n \n\nthe warrant and bail is set.  These events do not require the presence of counsel \nbecause  no  rights  are  affected  and  there  is  no  impact  on  the  effectiveness  of \ncounsel’s representation at trial.  Therefore, there is no right to counsel  at the \npreliminary arraignment.   \nIn short, we conclude that the amended complaint does not state a \ncause of action for actual denial of counsel.  It alleges that public defenders do not \nrepresent indigent defendants at every preliminary arraignment.  However, it is \nonly thereafter that the indigent criminal defendant has a right to counsel. \nConclusion \nThe amended complaint does not state a cause of action for either \nconstructive or actual denial of counsel, and the trial court correctly sustained the \nCounty’s preliminary objections.  The funding at any office of public defender \npresents  a  series  of  political  and  public  policy  challenges,  as  do  all  programs \nestablished to serve society’s less fortunate.  These questions are better resolved in \nthe political process, which includes the County’s budgetary processes. \nFor these reasons, we affirm the order of the trial court sustaining the \nCounty’s preliminary objections and dismissing the amended complaint.10 \n            ______________________________ \n          MARY HANNAH LEAVITT, Judge \n                                           \n10 Because we affirm the trial court’s dismissal of the amended complaint, we need not address \nthe question of whether the current Chief Public Defender was an indispensable party or the \nCounty’s cross-appeal. \n23 \n \n\nIN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \n \nAl Flora, Jr., and Adam Kuren and   : \nSteven Allabaugh, on behalf of   : \nthemselves and all others similarly   : \nsituated,         : \n    Appellants  : \n        : \n  v.      :   No. 2072 C.D. 2013 \n        :    \nLuzerne County of the     : \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania   : \nand Robert C.

The 70 current members of the Network represent hundreds of \nprisoners with innocence claims in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as \nwell as Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand \nand Taiwan.  The Network and its members are dedicated to improving the \naccuracy and reliability of the criminal justice system in future cases.  Drawing on \nlessons learned from cases in which the system convicted innocent persons, the \nNetwork advocates reforms designed to enhance the truth-seeking functions of the \ncriminal justice system and thereby prevent wrongful convictions. \nThe underfunding of indigent defense precludes indigent defendants \nfrom receiving adequate representation throughout criminal proceedings, \nundermining the adversarial system and, ultimately, preventing indigent criminal \ndefendants from receiving the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the \nUnited States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.  In this case, the Network seeks to \npresent a broad legal and factual perspective on how post-conviction proceedings, \nwhich rely on after-the-fact adjudication of individual defendants' claims of \nineffective assistance of counsel, fail to properly address the issue of systemic \n\nineffectiveness of counsel caused by inadequate defense funding.  Only by \nevaluating systemic ineffectiveness claims prospectively may the Court ensure that \nindigent defendants receive constitutionally adequate representation. \nThe Pennsylvania Innocence Project is a nonprofit legal clinic and \nresource center founded in 2008, housed at Temple University's Beasley School of \nLaw, and a member of the Network.  Its board of directors and advisory committee \ninclude practicing lawyers, law professors, former United States Attorneys, former \nstate court prosecutors, and the deans of the law schools of Temple University, \nDrexel University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Rutgers-Camden.  The \nProject provides pro bono investigative and legal services to indigent prisoners \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania whose claims of actual innocence \nare supported by the results of DNA testing or other, powerfully exculpatory \nevidence or whose claims, after a preliminary investigation, evince a substantial \npotential for the discovery of such evidence.  In addition, the Project works to \nremedy the underlying causes of wrongful convictions to ensure that no one will be \nconvicted and imprisoned for a crime they did not commit and to lessen the risk \nthat a wrongdoer will escape justice because an innocent person was convicted in \ntheir stead.  Adequate representation is the most basic necessity for ensuring the \ninnocent are not convicted in error. \n2 \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nAmici curiae adopt and incorporate the Statement of the Cases as presented by \nAppellants in their Brief to this Court. \nSTATEMENT OF QUESTIONS PRESENTED \nAmici curiae adopt and incorporate the Statement of Question Presented as \npresented by Appellants in their Brief to this Court. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIt is, according to the United States Supreme Court, an \"obvious \ntruth\" that lawyers are \"necessities, not luxuries\" in our adversarial system of \njustice.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963).  Yet, throughout the \nUnited States, including, according to the Amended Complaint, in Luzerne \nCounty, Pennsylvania, the fair and just functioning of our criminal defense system \nis undermined by the failure of local, county, and state governments to provide \nindigent defense funding sufficient for defense lawyers to meet even the most basic \nstandards of effective defense counsel.  That is, the indigent defense system is so \npoorly resourced that public defenders who rely on local, county, or state funding \nare unable to provide Constitutionally effective representation to indigent criminal \ndefendants because of the lack of that funding.  Thus, indigent criminal defendants \nproceed through the criminal process - and face each consequent harm, including \nexcessive bail, unnecessary pre-trial incarceration, and erroneous convictions-\n3 \n\nwithout the aid of the counsel promised by the United States and Pennsylvania \nConstitutions. \nHowever, post-conviction proceedings are incapable of remedying the \nsystemic deprivations of counsel occurring because of chronic inadequate funding \nfor indigent defense.  First, post-conviction review pursuant to Strickland v. \nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) is neither intended nor able to provide a remedy \nfor harms suffered from inadequate representation during pre-trial and pre \nconviction proceedings, such as wrongful denial of bail or unnecessary pre-trial \nincarceration, as Strickland focuses solely on whether ineffective assistance of \ncounsel resulted in an unreliable conviction or erroneous sentence.  Moreover, \nunder the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, a defendant loses the right to \nraise an ineffective assistance claim once released from custody, thus, wrongfully \nconvicted defendants facing shorter sentences have no recourse whatsoever to \nvindicate their Constitutional right to counsel. \nSecond, and more fundamentally, review under Strickland is entirely \nretrospective and narrowly circumscribed, with the sole question before a \nreviewing court whether a specific defendant was wrongfully convicted due to the \nineffectiveness of his attorney and the sole remedy available being a new trial for \nthat defendant.  Such review does not reach the systemic failure to provide indigent \ndefendants as a class with effective counsel and does nothing whatsoever to ensure \n4 \n\nindigent defendants receive adequate representation from the outset of a criminal \nprosecution. The prospective relief sought in the Amended Complaint is the only \nway to address the continued and system-wide Constitutional injuries sustained by \nindigent criminal defendants. \nARGUMENT \nA.  Failure To Adequately Fund Indigent Defense Counsel Deprives \nDefendants Of Constitutionally Effective Representation \nThe most fundamental principle of the American criminal justice \nsystem is that truth is best achieved (and innocents thereby protected) through an \nadversarial process - partisan advocates exploring and testing facts and evidence \nbefore a neutral arbiter - and the concomitant right to counsel is enshrined in the \nSixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the \nPennsylvania Constitution.  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has explained \nthat \"[t]he very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan \nadvocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that the \nguilty be convicted and the innocent go free.\"  Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, \n862 (1975). \nHowever, the goal of truth in our adversarial system is thwarted by the \nsimple fact that adequate legal representation cannot be rendered unless indigent \ndefense systems are adequately funded.  For instance, the ABA has also set forth \nits Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System, which include: (1) \n5 \n\nindependence of the defense function; (2) a caseload management system; (3) \nprompt screening for and assignment to indigent defense counsel; (4 ) adequate \ntime and space for counsel to meet with defendants; (5) workload controls to \nensure adequate representation; (6 ) training and experience requirements for \nattorneys; (7) continuous representation throughout a defendant's case; (8) \nresource parity between the defense and prosecution functions; (9) continuing legal \neducation for defense counsel; and (10) supervision and review of defense \ncounsel's performance.  (See Standing Comm. on Legal Aid & Indigent \nDefendants, ABA, The Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System.)1  But, \nthe ability of indigent defense systems to meet these standards is dependent on \nstate, county, and local governments providing indigent defenders proper \nresources.  Without adequate funding, the indigent defense system is left unable to \nmeet any of the standards set forth for adequate public defense, and is instead \nmarked by severely excessive caseloads; inexperienced lawyers; lack of attorney \nAppellants allege conditions at the Luzerne County Office of the Public Defender \n(\"OPD\") that would fail to meet each of these standards.  According to the Amended \nComplaint, \"[t]he OPD has an insufficient amount of clerical staff,\" (Am. Compl. <][ 96), \n\"[t]he OPD lacks appropriate scheduling software to keep track of important case \ndeadlines and provide reminders,\" (Am. Compl. <][ 97); \"[t]he OPD lacks an appropriate \ncomputerized data or case management system to track cases and provide meaningful \nbreakdowns of attorney caseloads,\" (Am. Compl. <][ 98); \"[m]any attorneys do not have \ntheir own desks or workspaces,\" (Am. Compl. § 99); the OPD is \"unable to provide \nconsistent, ongoing supervision of the attorneys,\" (Am. Compl. <][ 101); \"[t]he Adult Unit \ndoes not have any performance standards or guidelines for its attorneys,\" (Am. Compl. \n<][ 102).  If true, these allegations would establish that the OPD is incapable to providing \nrepresentation that meets applicable professional standards. \n6 \n\ncontact with defendants; lack of investigation; and lack of zealous advocacy.  See \ngenerally Gideon's Broken Promise: America's Continuing Quest for Equal \nJustice, American Bar Association (2004). \nPredictably, the failure to receive adequate representation is the \nbiggest contributing factor to erroneous convictions.  See, e.g., Liebman, J.S., \nFagan, J., West, V., & Lloyd, J. (2000), Capital Attrition: Error Rates In Capital \nCases, 1973-1995, 78 Tex. L. Rev. 1839.  Amicus Innocence Network members \nhave collectively represented hundreds of innocent clients convicted of crimes they \ndid not commit where inadequate trial counsel was a contributing factor to the \nwrongful conviction.  For example, in 2007, DNA evidence exonerated Jimmy Rae \nBromgard who, by that point, had served over fifteen years in prison for child rape. \nSee Gershowitz, Adam, Raise the Proof\" A Default Rule for Indigent Defense, 40 \nConn. L. Rev. 85, 98 (2007).  At trial, his appointed counsel had performed no \ninvestigation, made no pre-trial motions, gave no opening statement, made no \nattempt to exclude an equivocal eyewitness identification, presented no expert \ntestimony, gave no closing statement and filed no appeal.  ld.  Bromgard's attorney \nfailed to provide any defense whatsoever because he was performing under a flat \nfee contract with the state that paid him the same amount regardless of the number \nof hours he worked on the case.  See Lefstein, Norman, In Search of Gideon's \n7 \n\nPromise: Lessons From England and the Need for Federal Help, 55 Hastings L.J. \n835, 860 (2004). \nSimilarly, Eddie Joe Lloyd served 17 years in Michigan prison for \nmurder and rape before being exonerated of both crimes through DNA evidence in \n2002.  Lloyd was initially charged with the offenses when, while hospitalized for \nhis mental illness, he had written to police with \"tips\" for solving various \noutstanding murders.  (See Cases, Innocence Project- Eddie Joe Lloyd, available \nat http://www .innocenceproject.org/c ases-false-imprisonment/eddie-joe-lloyd.) \nPolice interrogated Lloyd in the hospital, leading him to believe that if he \nconfessed and allowed himself to be arrested, he would help police \"smoke out\" \nthe real perpetrator.  Id.  Lloyd was originally represented by a court appointed \nattorney who received $150.00 for pre-trial preparation and investigation and who, \nin tum, gave $50 dollars to a convicted felon who conducted no investigation into \nLloyd's mental illness or coerced confession.  ld.  Lloyd's counsel withdrew eight \ndays prior to trial and replaced with a second court appointed lawyer who did not \nmeet with prior counsel, did not question the details of the investigation, did not \ncross-examine the involved police officers, called no defense witnesses and gave a \nfive minute closing statement.  Id.  A separate attorney appointed to file Lloyd's \ndirect appeal did not visit Lloyd in prison at all or raise an ineffective assistance of \ncounsel claim.  ld.  Instead, after Lloyd wrote to the court saying his appellate \n8 \n\nassistance was lacking, his appointed counsel responded that Lloyd \"was guilty \nand should die.\"  Id. \nCritically, though, erroneous convictions are not the lone consequence \nfacing an inadequately represented criminal defendant.  Lack of adequate funding \nfor indigent defense programs precludes those programs from hiring a sufficient \nnumber of attorneys to meet the demand on them.  Consequently, each public \ndefender bears excessively high caseloads.  While national standards recommend \nthat public defenders handle no more than 150 felony, 400 misdemeanor, 200 \njuvenile, 200 mental health, or 25 appeals per year, a recent census of public \ndefense offices conducted by the Department of Justice found that 73 percent of \ncounty-based public defenders lacked enough attorneys to meet these caseload \nstandards, and 23 percent of responding offices had less than half of the necessary \nattorneys to meet caseload standards.2  Parole, Jr., Donald J., and Langton, Lynn, \nCounty-Based and Local Public Defender Offices, 2007?  This excessive caseload \nhas severe pretrial consequences for indigent defendants.  Public defenders lack the \n2  The Amended Complaint contains allegations that, if proven true, would grossly exceed \nnationwide standards.  According to the Amended Complaint, an attorney with the OPD \nreceives 331 new cases each year.  (Am. Compl. Cj[ 89.)  In addition to cases carrying over \nfrom a prior year, each attorney handles, on average, 436 cases per year.  (Id.) \n3  It's important to note that this survey was conducted prior to the recession, which began \nin 2008.  More recent analysis by the Department of Justice has shown that state funding \nfor indigent defense programs has decreased since 2008.  See State Government Indigent \nDefense Expenditures, FY 2008-2012, available at \nhttp://www .bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/sgide0812.pdf. \n9 \n\ntime to meet with their clients or conduct timely bail hearings.  See Taylor, Kate, \nSystem Overload: The Costs of Under-Resourcing Public Defense (2011).  For \nexample, a study conducted in Louisiana found that public defenders who \nrepresented 85 percent of the inmates in a particular parish made 31 pretrial \njailhouse visits, while private attorneys who represented 15 percent of the inmates \nmade 236 pretrial jailhouse visits during the same period.  See Gershowitz, supra, \nat 94.  Accordingly, indigent defendants can be subject to excessive pretrial \nincarceration - and the attendant social consequences, including job loss, loss of \nresidence, and family and community destabilization - for the simple reason that \ntheir appointed attorney does not have the time to see to their release.  See Parole, \net al., supra. \nMoreover, over-burdened defense attorneys are heavily incentivized \nto negotiate guilty pleas quickly, and without the benefit of having conducted any \ninvestigation into their clients' innocence, in order to reduce their caseloads.  At \nthe same time, indigent defendants who are receiving little to no pretrial \nrepresentation are themselves motivated to plead guilty to crimes they did not \ncommit fearing that refusing to do so could result in greater delays in reaching trial \n- and therefore lengthier pretrial incarceration - and harsher sentences upon \nconviction, which, as noted, is substantially more probable notwithstanding a \ndefendant's innocence because of the ineffectiveness of their appointed defense \n10 \n\nattorney during the pretrial investigatory phase and at trial.  See Taylor, supra, at \n20.  Indeed, as a practical matter, plea bargaining is little more than a cost-benefit \nanalysis for an innocent defendant - plead guilty to a lesser charge that may lead to \nrelease from prison or seek trial to prove their innocence at risk of facing \nmaximum sentencing for a crime they did not commit.  And, this practical reality is \neasily leveraged by prosecutors who will offer the greater incentives to plead guilty \nwhere the evidence of the defendant's guilt -presumably lacking in the case of an \ninnocent defendant- is weakest.  See Blume, John H. & Helm, Rebecca, K, The \nUnexonerated: Factually Innocent Defendants Who Plead Guilty, Cornell Faculty \nWorking Papers, 17 (2014). \nThe Supreme Court has stated that \"[i]t is beyond dispute that '\"[t]he \nSixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to \ncounsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,'\" Marshall v. Rodgers, 133 \nS.Ct. 1446, 1449 (2013) (quoting Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 80-81 (2004)), and \nthat the counsel to which all criminal defendants are entitled must be effective to \nbe Constitutionally adequate, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 \n(1984).  However, it is equally beyond dispute that the indigent defense system, \nwithout additional funding, cannot meet these standards.  Thus, system-wide, \nindigent criminal defendants are deprived of their Constitutional right to effective \ncounsel. \n11 \n\nB.  Strickland Is Neither Intended Nor Able To Address Claims Of \nSystemic Ineffective Assistance Of Counsel \nThe Court in Strickland explicitly declined to set forth or endorse \nminimum standards for representation adequate to satisfy the Sixth Amendment. \nInstead, the sole question Strickland decided was considering - \"the standards by \nwhich to judge a contention that the Constitution requires that a criminal judgment \nbe overturned because of the actual ineffective assistance of counsel.\"  466 U.S. at \n684.  The Court thus held that, in order to overturn a conviction based on the \nineffective assistance of counsel, a prisoner must show (1) that the performance of \nhis counsel was deficient, i.e., that he \"made errors so serious that counsel was not \nfunctioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\" \nand (2) that the deficient performance by his counsel prejudiced his defense, i.e., \n\"that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a \ntrial whose result is reliable.\"  Id. at 687. \nThe Strickland test is necessarily retrospective - evaluating a claim \nonly after a conviction (one, but far from the only, possible consequence of \nineffective assistance of counsel) has occurred- and narrowly focused on a single \nprisoner and his claim.  Indeed, the only relief granted in a successful \nineffectiveness claim under Strickland is a new trial or new sentencing for the \neffected prisoner.  However, relegating all forms of claims of ineffectiveness to the \npost-conviction context ignores the myriad ways a defendant's Sixth Amendment \n12 \n\nrights are violated throughout a criminal prosecution.  For this reason, Courts have \nheld that Strickland is simply not an appropriate test for evaluating systemic \nineffectiveness claims and for achieving prospective relief, i.e., the provision of \nConstitutionally adequate counsel for indigent defendants.  As the Seventh Circuit \nhas stated: \nThis standard is inappropriate for a civil suit seeking \nprospective relief.  The sixth amendment protects rights \nthat do not affect the outcome of trial.  Thus, deficiencies \nthat do not meet the \"ineffectiveness\" standard may \nnonetheless violate a defendant's rights under the sixth \namendment.  In the post-trial context, such errors may be \ndeemed harmless because they did not affect the outcome \nof trial.  Whether an accused has been prejudiced by the \ndenial of a right is an issue that relates to relief- whether \nthe defendant is entitled to have his or her conviction \noverturned - rather than to the question of whether such a \nright exists and can be protected prospectively. \nLuckey, III v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1017 (7th Cir. 1988). \nAs noted, indigent defendants suffer severe harm from the outset of a \ncriminal prosecution due to their lack of adequate representation that review \npursuant to Strickland cannot reach.  For instance, post-conviction review provides \nno remedy for defendants who experienced prolonged pretrial detention due to \ndefense counsel's excessive caseload.  These defendants are deprived a remedy for \na Constitutional violation that results in severe and long-lasting personal and \nsocietal injuries, notwithstanding the Supreme Court's acknowledgement of the \nright to effective assistance of counsel during preliminary hearings, arraignments, \n13 \n\nand during plea negotiations.  See Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 54 (1961); \nColeman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 7 (1970); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, \n774 (1970); Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 368-69 (2010). \nMore fundamentally, Strickland does nothing whatsoever to ensure \nindigent defendants receive the benefit of their Sixth Amendment right to effective \ncounsel.  For instance, a successful individual defendant raising a post-conviction \nineffectiveness claim nevertheless must experience lengthy incarceration through \nyears of court proceedings and the resulting personal damage, including, but not \nlimited to, loss of family, residence, and employment, just to reach a point where a \nCourt will order the appointment of competent counsel for a new trial.  See, e.g., \nThe Innocence Project, Making Up for Lost time: What the Wrongfully Convicted \nEndure and How to Provide Fair Compensation, 7-11 (discussing the \npsychological, physical, and financial obstacles that exonerated defendants face). \nFinally, even if an individual defendant may ultimately overcome the injustices \nborn from inadequate representation, the deficient indigent defense system that led \nto those injustices is left untouched, exposing all other indigent defendants to the \nsame dire consequences of being denied the right to effective counsel in their \ncriminal proceedings. \n14 \n\nOnly the prospective relief sought in the Amended Complaint can \nremedy the many Constitutional violations borne by indigent criminal defendants \ndue to the inadequate funding of the indigent defense system. \nC.  The Pennsylvania PCRA Imposes Additional Hurdles To Review \nOf Ineffectiveness Claims \nIt is a fact of the criminal justice system that individuals may be held \naccountable for crimes they did not commit.  See, e.g., the National Registry of \nExoneration, Exonerations in 2014 (Jan. 27, 2015) (noting that the National \nRegistry of Exonerations has recorded 125 exonerations in 2014).  Whether an \ninnocent person pleads guilty to a lesser offense carrying a lesser sentence to avoid \nthe risk of conviction on greater charges or an individual is erroneously convicted \nof an offense carrying a shorter sentence, where those results are caused by \nineffective representation, a Sixth Amendment violation has occurred.  However, \nnotwithstanding clear constitutional violations, in Pennsylvania if an erroneously \nconvicted individual is no longer in custody by the time a post-conviction \nproceeding has been adjudicated, that person is barred from vindicating their rights \nunder the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (\"PCRA\"). \nTo be eligible for relief under the PCRA, a defendant: \nMust plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence \nall of the following: \n15 \n\n( 1) That the petitioner has been convicted of a crime \nunder the laws of this Commonwealth and is at the time \nrelief is granted: \n(i) currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, \nprobation or parole for the crime ... \n(2) That the conviction or sentence resulted from one or \nmore of the following: \n(ii) Ineffective assistance of counsel which, in the \ncircumstances of the particular case, so undermined the \ntruth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of \nguilt or innocence could have taken place. \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9543. \nIn Commonwealth v. Turner, the defendant filed a PCRA petition \nseeking to overturn her conviction for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance \non the grounds that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate \nexculpatory evidence and call character witnesses.  19 Pa. D. & C. 5th 129, 130 \n(Phila. Ct. Comm. Pl. 2010).  During the pendency of her petition, the defendant \ncompleted her probation sentence.  Id. at 131.  Nevertheless, arguing that her \nConstitutional right to counsel had been denied her, defendant sought an \nevidentiary hearing to determine whether her counsel was Constitutionally \nineffective.  Id. at 135.  Arguing that defendant's PCRA petition was mooted upon \ndefendant's completion of her probation sentence, the Commonwealth argued for \ndismissal of the petition.  Noting that defendant \"has a strong interest in \n16 \n\noverturning her felony conviction so that she can cure her civil disabilities, clear \nher reputation, and restore her ability to work at jobs from which she would be \ndisqualified by a felony conviction\" the court held that strictly following the terms \nof the PCRA would \"not comport with fundamental fairness,\" noting that \"[i]t is \nillogical to bar defendants serving short sentences from obtaining relief and confer \nunequal and, ironically, more substantive procedural protection to convicted \ndefendants serving longer sentences.\"  ld. at 140.  Accordingly, the court held that \ndefendant was \"entitled to relief because she has a Sixth Amendment right to \neffective assistance of counsel and Pennsylvania is not giving her an opportunity to \nbe heard.\"  ld. \nOn the Commonwealth's appeal, this Court reversed the PCRA \ncourt's decision.  Though noting that \"[t]he Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution entitle a defendant to the effective assistance of \ncounsel,\" Commonwealth v. Turner, 80 A.3d 754, 761 (Pa. 2013), the Court held \nthat \"[because] individuals who are not serving a state sentence have no liberty \ninterest in and therefore no due process right to collateral review of that sentence, \nthe statutory limitation of collateral review to individuals serving a sentence of \nimprisonment, probation, or parole is consistent with the due process prerequisite \nof a protected liberty interest.\"  Id. at 766.  The Court went on, \"[o]f course, the \nlegislature was free to extend a statutory right of collateral review to individuals \n17 \n\nlike Petitioner who had completed their sentence and, had they done so, they would \nbe constitutionally obligated to ensure that those rights were impacted only in \naccord with due process .... However, the legislature did not do so.\"  Id. \nUnder Turner, inadequately represented innocents who, through plea \nor trial, are convicted of a crime they did not commit, but who have served their \nsentences, are procedurally precluded from vindicating their Constitutional rights. \nHowever, by asserting an absolute bar to post-conviction relief for such defendants, \nthe Turner decision highlights the fundamental need for allowing prospective \nclaims of systemic ineffective assistance of counsel to go forward.  As the Turner \ncase demonstrates, inadequately represented criminal defendants face dire \nconsequences, even if those consequences do not include lengthy terms of \nincarceration or probation.  But, regardless of the length of a defendants' sentence, \nin a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel, it is still the product of a \nConstitutional violation.  Only by permitting appellants' claim for prospective \nrelief to go forward can this Court ensure that indigent defendants receive \nconstitutionally adequate representation and that no Sixth Amendment violations \nmay evade review. \n18 \n\nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, Amici request that this \nCourt permit Appellants' cause of action to proceed. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nTeren e M.

Initially, the Michigan Supreme Court on April 30, 2010, vacated and remanded in \npart and affirmed in part the Court of Appeals’ decision. Regarding the constructive denial of counsel issue, the Supreme Court \n \nstated that “[t]his case is at its earliest stages and, based solely on the plaintiffs’ pleadings in this case, it is premature to make a \ndecision on the substantive issues.” Duncan, 486 Mich. 906, 780 N.W.2d 843, 844 (2010). Therefore, the Court held that \nsummary disposition was inappropriate. The Court subsequently granted and vacated several reconsideration orders. Ultimately, \nthe court reinstated its original April 30th order. Duncan, 488 Mich. 957, 790 N.W.2d 695 (Mich.2010) ( “[W]e REINSTATE our \norder in this case dated April 30, 2010, because reconsideration thereof was improperly granted.”). \n \n8  Courts may compel additional funding if the appropriated amount is inadequate to comply with statutory or constitutional \nobligations. See Kistler v. Carbon County, 154 Pa.Super. 299, 35 A.2d 733, 735 (1944) (holding that county commissioners cannot \n \n“limit or avoid liabilities imposed upon the county by the Constitution or by statutes”). The “administration of justice” must be \nconstrued more broadly than involving just the courts. Related entities, such as the Office of Public Defender, also participate in \nthe administration of justice. \n \n9  They state: \n(C) At the preliminary arraignment, a copy of the complaint accepted for filing pursuant to Rule 508 shall be given to the \n \ndefendant. \n  10 \n \n\nFlora v. Luzerne County of Com. of Pennsylvania, 103 A.3d 125 (2014)   \n \n \n(D) If the defendant was arrested with a warrant, the issuing authority shall provide the defendant with copies of the warrant \nand supporting affidavit(s) at the preliminary arraignment, unless the warrant and affidavit(s) are not available at that time, in \nwhich event the defendant shall be given copies no later than the first business day after the preliminary arraignment. \nPA. R.CRIM.P. 540(C), (D). \n \n10  Because we affirm the trial court’s dismissal of the amended complaint, we need not address the question of whether the \ncurrent Chief Public Defender was an indispensable party or the County’s cross-appeal. \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n  11 \n ",

Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), that the Sixth Amendment guarantees access \nto counsel in state court for all those charged with a felony.1  This Court will \nbecome the second state court of last resort to consider whether indigent \ndefendants who are assigned counsel in name only may vindicate that Sixth \nAmendment right through a constructive denial-of-counsel claim for prospective \ninjunctive relief, or whether their only remedy is to seek post-conviction relief \nunder Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  The New York Court of \nAppeals was the first state court of last resort to consider this question, and in \nHurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217 (N.Y. 2010), it upheld the right of \nindigent defendants to seek relief in a civil action asserting a constructive denial of \nthe right to counsel, as guaranteed by Gideon.  That ruling was correct.  The \navailability of civil actions for constructive denial of counsel is critical to \nprotecting the constitutional right to counsel that Gideon recognized.   \n                                           \n1  The Court later made clear that the guarantee of access to counsel extends \nto all criminal defendants faced with incarceration, including those charged with \nmisdemeanors.  See Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 661-662 (2002).  For \nsimplicity’s sake, this brief sometimes uses “Gideon” as shorthand for the Court’s \nrecognition of the right to counsel in both felony and misdemeanor contexts. \n\n- 2 - \nThe Commonwealth Court has deprived indigent defendants in Pennsylvania \nof this essential tool, well grounded in the law, for enforcing their constitutional \nright to counsel.  This Court should correct that error.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE QUESTION INVOLVED \n \n  The United States will address: \nWhether a civil claim for prospective, injunctive relief based on constructive \ndenial of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution is \ncognizable.2 \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nThe United States has a strong interest in ensuring that all jurisdictions – \nfederal, state, and local – are fulfilling their constitutional obligation to provide \ncounsel to criminal defendants facing incarceration who cannot afford an attorney, \nas required by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).  In March 2010, the \nAttorney General launched the Office for Access to Justice to address the crisis in \nindigent defense services.  The Office coordinates the Department of Justice’s \ncommitment to improving indigent defense.  See Office for Access to Justice, \nhttp://www.justice.gov/atj (last visited Sept. 8, 2015).     \n                                           \n2  The United States takes no position on the merits of this particular case.  \nThe United States also takes no position on the state-law mandamus issue or on \nany issue particular to the claim based on the Pennsylvania Constitution. \n\n- 3 - \nThe Department of Justice enforces the right to counsel in juvenile \ndelinquency proceedings under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \nAct of 1994, 42 U.S.C. 14141.  For example, the Department entered into a \ncomprehensive memorandum of agreement with Shelby County, Tennessee, that \nrequires the County, among other things, to appoint counsel before children appear \nbefore a magistrate judge, and to establish a juvenile defender unit within the \npublic defender’s office.3   \nThe Department of Justice has filed statements of interest (SOIs) in cases \ninvolving constructive denial-of-counsel claims under the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  See U.S. SOI, Hurrell-Harring v. State, No. 8866-07 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. \nSept. 25, 2014)4; U.S. SOI, Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 989 F. Supp. 2d 1122 \n(W.D.

The Department, for example, has identified indigent \ndefense as a priority area for Byrne-JAG funds, the leading source of federal \njustice funding to state and local jurisdictions.7  In 2013, at a government-wide \nevent hosted by the Department, the Department’s Office of Justice Programs \nannounced a collection of grants totaling $6.7 million to improve legal defense \nservices for the poor.8  These grants were preceded in 2012 by a $1.2 million grant \nprogram, Answering Gideon’s Call: Strengthening Indigent Defense Through \nImplementing the ABA Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System, \n                                           \n6  available at \nhttp://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2015/03/13/np_soi_3-13-\n15.pdf. \n \n7  See Government Accountability Office, Indigent Defense: DOJ Could \nIncrease Awareness of Eligible Funding and Better Determine the Extent to Which \nFunds Help Support this Purpose, 11-14 (May 2012), \nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/600/590736.pdf. \n \n8  Office of Public Affairs, Attorney General Holder Announces $6.7 Million \nto Improve Legal Defense Services for the Poor (Oct. 30, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/october/13-ag-1156.html.

They seek certification of a class comprised of “all \nindigent adults in Luzerne County who are or will be represented by the Office of \nthe Public Defender from this point until the Office of the Public Defender has the \nfunding and resources necessary to enable it to meet ethical, legal, and \nconstitutional standards of representation.”  (R. 852a).   \n1.  Plaintiffs’ claim under 42 U.S.C. 1983 asserts a violation of their Sixth \nAmendment right to counsel, as articulated in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 \n(1963).  (R. 882a-883a).  Plaintiffs ask the court to compel the County to provide \nthe necessary funding to allow OPD to provide constitutional representation to \n                                           \n9  See Office for Access to Justice, Accomplishments (July 21, 2015), \navailable at http://www.justice.gov/atj/accomplishments. \n \n\n- 6 - \nindigent defendants.  (R. 861a).  Among other allegations,10 the complaint sets out \nthe following: \n•  “Without significantly more lawyers and support staff, [OPD attorneys] \nwill continue to endure overwhelming caseloads that effectively preclude \nconstitutionally adequate representation.”  (R. 864a). \n \n•  “[G]iven the OPD’s current volume of work, [OPD]  *  *  *  lawyers are \nunable to engage in many of the basic functions of representation, including \nconferring with clients in a meaningful way prior to critical stages of their legal \nproceedings, reviewing client files, conducting discovery, motion practice, and \nfactual investigation, as well as devoting necessary time to prepare for hearings, \ntrials, and appeals.”  (R. 864a). \n \n•  OPD attorneys “simply do not have the time and resources to provide \nconstitutionally adequate and professionally required representation for the \nmajority of Public Defender clients.”  (R. 864a). \n \n•  “[H]eavy caseloads regularly lead to scheduling conflicts, causing OPD \nattorneys to request continuances of critical proceedings.  These continuances can \nlead to clients remaining in pre-trial detention for longer periods than necessary.”  \n(R. 867a). \n \n•  “The heavy caseloads also frequently result in the OPD attorneys’ inability \nto consult with their clients prior to each stage of their case.  Consequently, OPD \nattorneys participate in many stages of their clients’ criminal proceedings without a \nfull understanding of the facts and potential strategies for the case.”  (R. 867a). \n \n•  “[B]ecause of scheduling conflicts, OPD lawyers must frequently \nsubstitute for one another and thus attend proceedings for cases of which they have \nno prior knowledge.”  (R. 867a). \n \n•  “OPD attorneys are often unable to conduct reasonable factual \ninvestigation prior to the pre-trial hearing or even prior to negotiating a plea \nagreement.”  (R. 867a). \n                                           \n10  The United States takes no position on whether plaintiffs’ allegations are \ntrue or will be proved.   \n\n- 7 - \n•  “When discovery is obtained, the attorneys are frequently unable to review \nthe information.  If discovery responses are inadequate or incomplete, attorneys \nrarely have time to follow up to obtain complete information.”  (R. 867a). \n \n•  “OPD attorneys also rarely have time to conduct the necessary fact inquiry \nand investigation prior to preliminary hearings.”  (R. 867a). \n \n•  “Generally, OPD attorneys are limited to a few minutes’ introduction \nimmediately prior to the hearings in a non-secure area of a district magistrate’s \noffice, or a similarly brief meeting at the County prison.  These brief meetings are \nnot sufficient to gather information about a case to provide constitutionally \nadequate representation.”  (R. 869a). \n \n•  OPD attorneys are often unable to contact their clients at any point during \nthe three-month period between the preliminary hearing and the status conference, \nor in the one-month period between the status conference and the pre-trial hearing.  \n(R. 870a).  \n \n•  “OPD attorneys are often unable to conduct meaningful and \ncomprehensive interviews with clients until the eve of trial, if the case proceeds \nthat far.”  (R. 870a). \n \n•  “Overall, OPD attorneys are unable to maintain regular contact with their \nclients and to follow up on client attempts to communicate with them.”  (R. 871a). \n \n•  OPD attorneys handle massive caseloads that far exceed the maximum \ncaseloads recommended by the American Bar Association and must fulfill other \ntime-consuming responsibilities as well.  (R. 872a-874a). \n \n•  OPD attorneys are often scheduled to appear in two different courtrooms \nat the same time.  (R. 874a). \n \n•  “[M]any [OPD] attorneys still do not have their own desks, workspaces, or \ndedicated phone lines, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to receive and \nreturn calls from clients.”  (R. 874a-875a). \n \n\n- 8 - \n2.  The trial court granted the County’s motion to dismiss, concluding that \nplaintiffs lacked standing11 and did not state a valid claim.  Flora v. Luzerne Cnty., \n103 A.3d 125, 130 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2014), reargument denied (Dec. 2, 2014).  \nPlaintiffs appealed, and the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court affirmed.  Id. at \n140. \nThe Commonwealth Court held that a civil claim for constructive denial of \ncounsel is not a cognizable claim.  Flora, 103 A.3d at 136.  The court explained its \nholding by stating (1) that it “accept[ed] the analyses of the dissenting judges in \nHurrell–Harring and Duncan [v. State, 774 N.W.2d 89 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009)] and \nreject[ed] as not persuasive the majority opinions in those cases,” and (2) that \n“there is no precedent from the United States Supreme Court acknowledging that a \nconstructive denial-of-counsel claim may be brought in a civil case that seeks \nprospective relief in the form of more funding and resources to an entire office, as \n                                           \n11  There were two separate standing issues in this case.  The first was \nwhether one of the original plaintiffs, former Chief Public Defender Al Flora, \ncontinued to have a cognizable injury after he stopped working at OPD.  The trial \ncourt concluded that he did not, and the Commonwealth Court agreed.  Flora v. \nLuzerne Cnty., 103 A.3d 125, 130 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2014), reargument denied \n(Dec. 2, 2014).  The plaintiffs petitioned this Court on that standing issue, but this \nCourt declined to review it.  Flora v. Luzerne Cnty., No. 951 MAL 2014, 2015 WL \n3996993 (Pa. June 30, 2015) (granting the petition in part).  Thus, the \nCommonwealth Court’s ruling that Flora lacks standing is final.  The second \nstanding issue, whether the indigent clients of OPD have standing, “merges with \nthe question of whether the amended complaint states a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted.”  Flora, 103 A.3d at 133. \n\n- 9 - \nopposed to relief to individual indigent criminal defendants.”  Ibid.  The court also \nindicated agreement with the Duncan dissent’s conclusion that recognition of such \na cause of action would violate separation-of-powers principles.  Ibid.   \nThe court then ruled that, even if a civil constructive denial-of-counsel claim \nexists, it was not adequately pleaded here.  Flora, 103 A.3d at 136-137.  The court \ncharacterized the complaint as alleging that Luzerne County OPD attorneys “meet \nonly briefly with indigent clients, rarely contact clients between court appearances, \ndo not conduct significant investigation or discovery, do not engage in sufficient \ntrial preparation, and cannot properly litigate appeals due to lack of experience.”  \nId. at 137.  It concluded that “[t]hese allegations do not create circumstances that \nare ‘so likely [to create prejudice] that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not \nworth the cost.’”  Ibid. (alteration in original) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, \n466 U.S. 668 (1984)).  The court concluded that, because prejudice could not \nproperly be inferred under the circumstances alleged in the complaint, plaintiffs’ \nonly recourse is to bring a post-conviction Strickland claim.  \nFinally, the court concluded that plaintiffs did not state a claim for actual \ndenial of counsel.  Flora, 103 A.3d at 139-140.  The court recognized that \nplaintiffs’ complaint alleges nonrepresentation at preliminary arraignments.  Id. at \n139.  But the court concluded that, though the right to counsel attaches at the \n\n- 10 - \npreliminary arraignment, “the defendant does not have a right to counsel to \nrepresent him at the preliminary arraignment.”  Ibid.  \nPlaintiffs filed a petition for allowance to appeal with this Court, which this \nCourt granted in part. \nARGUMENT \n \nA CIVIL CLAIM FOR CONSTRUCTIVE DENIAL OF COUNSEL UNDER \nTHE SIXTH AMENDMENT IS COGNIZABLE  \n \n  The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that “[i]n all criminal \nprosecutions, the accused shall  *  *  *  have the Assistance of Counsel for his \ndefense.”  U.S. Const. Amend. VI.  In Gideon v. Wainwright, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel requires state courts to \nappoint attorneys for defendants who are charged with felonies and cannot afford \nto retain counsel, because “any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a \nlawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.”  372 U.S. \n335, 344 (1963).  The Court explained that “lawyers in criminal courts are \nnecessities, not luxuries.”  Ibid.  This Court also has explained that “the right to \ncounsel has been recognized as a fundamental right, one that is essential to the goal \nof ensuring that every criminal defendant receives a fair trial before an impartial \ntribunal.”  Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 738 A.2d 406, 422 (Pa. 1999) (citing Gideon, \n372 U.S. at 344-345).   \n\n- 11 - \nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel requires more than the mere \nappointment of a member of the bar.  The right of indigent criminal defendants to \nbe provided an attorney may be violated by the government’s actual denial of \ncounsel, or by a constructive denial of counsel.12  A civil claim for systemic \nprospective relief based on constructive denial of counsel is viable:  (1) when, on a \nsystem-wide basis, the traditional markers of representation – such as timely and \nconfidential consultation with clients, appropriate investigation, and meaningful \nadversarial testing of the prosecution’s case – are absent or significantly \ncompromised; and (2) when substantial structural limitations – such as a severe \nlack of resources, unreasonably high workloads, or critical understaffing of public \ndefender offices – cause that absence or limitation on representation.  In these \ncircumstances, the appointment of counsel is merely cosmetic, effectively resulting \nin a lawyer in name only.  And when that is the case – that is, when the totality of \nthe circumstances indicate that structural limitations are causing such a system-\nwide problem of nonrepresentation – indigent criminal defendants may seek \n                                           \n12  Strickland claims and Gideon claims are doctrinally distinct.  An \nineffective assistance-of-counsel claim under Strickland contends that counsel \n(whether appointed or selected and paid for by the defendant) failed to represent \nhis or her client effectively, and that that failure prejudiced the client.  A \nconstructive denial-of-counsel claim under Gideon asserts a form of \nnonrepresentation – that appointed counsel is counsel in name only – and seeks \nprospective relief.  In a constructive denial-of-counsel claim no individualized \nshowing of prejudice is required. \n\n- 12 - \nprospective, systemic relief in a civil suit to protect the full Sixth Amendment \nrights of the class that they represent. \n  The concept of a constructive denial-of-counsel claim is both legitimate and \nrooted in U.S. Supreme Court case law.  In United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 \n(1984), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that some infringements of the right to \ncounsel are so significant that no showing of prejudice is necessary.  No showing \nof prejudice is required where there is a complete denial of counsel at a critical \nstage; where “counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution’s case to meaningful \nadversarial testing”; or where “although counsel is available to assist the accused \nduring trial, the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could \nprovide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is \nappropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.”  Id. at 659-660.  In \nPowell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), for example, the Court ruled that it would \nbe “vain” to give the defendant a lawyer “without giving the latter any opportunity \nto acquaint himself with the facts or law of the case.”  Id. at 59 (quoting \nCommonwealth v. O’Keefe, 148 A. 73, 74 (Pa. 1929)).  Similarly, in Avery v. \nAlabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940), the Court explained that “mere formal \nappointment” of counsel does not satisfy the right to counsel.  Specifically, the \nCourt ruled that “the denial of opportunity for appointed counsel to confer, to \nconsult with the accused and to prepare his defense, could convert the appointment \n\n- 13 - \nof counsel into a sham.”  Ibid.  Thus, the Court has repeatedly indicated that the \nabsence of traditional markers of representation can result in a constructive denial \nof counsel.13 \nA.  Courts That Have Considered The Issue Have Recognized That A Civil \nClaim For Constructive Denial Of Counsel Is Cognizable \n \n  Hurrell-Harring is the leading case recognizing a civil constructive denial-\nof-counsel claim and, in the United States’ view, is correctly reasoned.  The court \nin that case recognized a constructive denial-of-counsel claim under Gideon that is \ndistinct from an ineffective-assistance claim under Strickland.  The court \ndetermined that, “[g]iven the simplicity and autonomy of a claim for \nnonrepresentation, as opposed to one truly involving the adequacy of an attorney’s \nperformance, there is no reason  *  *  *  why such a claim cannot or should not be \nbrought without the context of a completed prosecution.”  Hurrell-Harring v. \n                                           \n13  To be sure, the Supreme Court did not ultimately conclude that the right \nto counsel was violated in Cronic or Avery.  In both cases, the Court concluded \nthat, in the particular circumstances presented, late appointment of counsel did not \njustify a presumption of ineffectiveness.  See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 665; Avery, 308 \nU.S. at 450-453.  The appointed counsel in those cases, the Court determined, were \nnot merely formal appointments who were unable to subject the government’s \ntheory to adversarial testing.  But in a systemic constructive denial-of-counsel \nclaim, plaintiffs allege that the counsel assigned to indigent defendants are counsel \nin name only and thus are not subjecting the government’s theory to meaningful \nadversarial testing, or providing other traditional markers of representation because \nof severe structural limitations that make these failures of representation inevitable.  \nThat situation is different from the facts underlying the individual claims at issue in \nCronic and Avery. \n\n- 14 - \nState, 930 N.E.2d 217, 225-226 (N.Y. 2010).  The court recognized that to \nconclude that this type of claim is only cognizable in an action for post-conviction \nrelief would be to prevent courts from effectively remedying systemic violations of \nGideon.  The court concluded that “the fairly minimal risks involved in sustaining \nthe closely defined claim of nonrepresentation we have recognized must be \nweighed against the very serious dangers that the alleged denial of counsel entails.”  \nId. at 226.  The court also determined that “enforcement of a clear constitutional or \nstatutory mandate is the proper work of the courts,” and the mere fact “that a \nremedy in this action would necessitate the appropriation of funds and perhaps, \nparticularly in a time of scarcity, some reordering of legislative priorities” was not \nreason enough to shrink from that obligation.  Id. at 227.   \n  The court in Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon followed a similar analysis.  \nLike Hurrell-Harring, it recognized that plaintiffs’ suit was not alleging ineffective \nassistance of counsel under Strickland, but rather was asserting a systemic \ndeprivation of the right to counsel promised in Gideon.  No. 2:11-cv-1100, 2012 \nWL 600727, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 23, 2012).  The Wilbur court concluded that \nplaintiffs had asserted facts that could support a finding “that the assignment of \npublic defenders is little more than a sham,” and that a civil action seeking a \nsystemic remedy was appropriate:  “Where official government policies trample \nrights guaranteed by the Constitution, the courts have not hesitated to use their \n\n- 15 - \nequitable powers to correct the underlying policies or systems.”  Id. at *2-3.  See \nalso Duncan v. State, 774 N.W.2d 89, 127 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009) (concluding that \nplaintiffs state a valid civil claim where they allege an actual denial of counsel, a \nconstructive denial of counsel, or conflicted counsel)14; Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d \n1012, 1018 (11th Cir. 1988) (concluding that a civil Sixth Amendment claim was \ncognizable where plaintiffs asserted, among other things, “systemic delays in the \nappointment of counsel,” that their attorneys are denied the resources necessary to \ninvestigate their cases, and that attorneys are pressured to hurry cases to trial and to \n15\nenter guilty pleas).    \n  The Commonwealth Court is the first court we are aware of to have ruled \nthat a claim for constructive denial of counsel is not cognizable at all.  The court’s \nprimary justification for that ruling was that “there is no precedent from the United \nStates Supreme Court acknowledging that a constructive denial-of-counsel claim \nmay be brought in a civil case that seeks prospective relief.”  Flora v. Luzerne \nCnty., 103 A.3d 125, 136 (Pa Commw. Ct. 2014), reargument denied (Dec. 2, \n                                           \n14  As the Commonwealth Court in this case explained, the procedural \nhistory of Duncan is complex, but ultimately the Court of Appeals affirmed that \nplaintiffs had stated a claim in that case.  See Flora v. Luzerne Cnty., 103 A.3d \n125, 135 n.7 (Pa Commw. Ct. 2014), reargument denied (Dec. 2, 2014). \n \n15  This case was dismissed on remand based on abstention grounds under \nYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  See Luckey v. Miller, 976 F.2d 673, 675 \n(11th Cir. 1992).  But the Eleventh Circuit’s initial opinion remains good law. \n\n- 16 - \n2014).  Specifically, the court noted that Strickland, Cronic, and Gideon were \ncases in which a defendant sought post-conviction relief, not civil actions.  But \nnone of those cases suggest, let alone hold, that the Sixth Amendment right to \ncounsel cannot be vindicated through a civil action.  The Commonwealth Court \nfailed to articulate any affirmative reason for its conclusion that a civil constructive \ndenial-of-counsel claim is not cognizable.   \nRather, the court simply stated that it accepted the analyses of the dissenting \njudges in Hurrell-Harring and Duncan.  Flora, 103 A.3d at 136.  But the dissent in \nHurrell-Harring expressly avoided espousing an absolute rule that a civil claim for \nconstructive denial of counsel is never cognizable.  It concluded instead that “the \nvarious claims asserted by plaintiffs [in that case] do not rise to that level.”  \nHurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 230 (Pigott, J., dissenting).  The dissent in \nDuncan, meanwhile, lends no relevant authority here as both the majority and \ndissent in that case viewed the claim through a Strickland lens alone.  Thus, the \nDuncan dissent should be interpreted as concluding (correctly) that a Strickland \nineffectiveness-of-counsel claim cannot be brought in a civil action.  See Duncan, \n774 N.W.2d at 158-166 (Whitbeck, J., dissenting). \nAnd though the Duncan dissent also found that the systemic relief the \nplaintiffs sought in that case would violate separation-of-powers principles, courts \nare not powerless to compel action by other branches of government in order to \n\n- 17 - \nremedy a constitutional violation.  To the contrary, courts have long recognized the \nnecessity of systemic equitable relief to correct unconstitutional conduct.  See, e.g., \nBrown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011); see also Hurrell-Harring, 930 N.E. 2d at 227 \n(“It is, of course, possible that a remedy in this action would necessitate the \nappropriation of funds and perhaps, particularly in a time of scarcity, some \nreordering of legislative priorities.  But this does not amount to an argument upon \nwhich a court might be relieved of its essential obligation to provide a remedy for \nviolation of a fundamental constitutional right.”). \nThis Court should reach the same conclusion that the courts in Hurrell-\nHarring and Wilbur reached.  It should rule that a constructive denial-of-counsel \nclaim based on Gideon is cognizable, and that such a claim is pled adequately \nwhere the allegations, if true, support a conclusion that assigned attorneys are \nattorneys in name only.  \nB.  Factors Relevant To A Constructive Denial-Of-Counsel Claim \nCourts should consider two related questions in assessing a claim for \nsystemic constructive denial of counsel:  (1) whether traditional markers of \nrepresentation are frequently absent or significantly compromised in plaintiffs’ \nrelationships with their assigned counsel; and (2) whether the absence of traditional \nmarkers of representation is caused by assigned attorneys operating under systemic \n\n- 18 - \nstructural limitations that prevent the attorneys from offering bona fide assistance \nof counsel. \n  Courts assessing a constructive denial-of-counsel claim should consider \nwhether traditional markers of representation are present for clients of the public \ndefender’s office.  These include the attorney’s availability to engage in \nmeaningful attorney-client contact to learn from and advise the client, the \nattorney’s ability to investigate the allegations and the client’s circumstances that \nmay inform strategy, and the attorney’s ability to advocate for the client either \nthrough plea negotiation, trial, or post-trial.  When these markers of representation \nare absent, there is a serious question whether the assigned counsel is merely a \nlawyer in name only.  Indeed, “[a]ctual representation assumes a certain basic \nrepresentational relationship.”  Hurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 224 (emphasis \nadded); see also Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 989 F. Supp. 2d 1122, 1124 \n(W.D. Wash. 2013) (finding that, where clients met their attorneys for the first time \nin court and immediately accepted a plea bargain, without discussing their cases in \na confidential setting, the system “amounted to little more than a ‘meet and plead’ \nsystem,” and that the resulting lack of representational relationship violated the \nSixth Amendment); Public Defender, Eleventh Jud. Cir. of Fla. v. State, 115 So. \n3d 261, 278 (Fla. 2013) (finding denial of counsel where attorneys were “mere \n\n- 19 - \nconduits for plea offers,” did not communicate with clients, were unable to \ninvestigate the allegations, and were unprepared for trial). \n  Concerning systemic structural limitations, courts should consider factors \nsuch as insufficient funding, insufficient staffing, excessive workloads, lack of \ntraining and supervision, and lack of resources.  In Wilbur, for example, the court \nnoted the structural limitations – insufficient staffing, excessive caseloads, and \nalmost nonexistent supervision – that resulted in a system “broken to such an \nextent that confidential attorney/client communications are rare, the individual \ndefendant is not represented in any meaningful way, and actual innocence could \nconceivably go unnoticed and unchampioned.”  Wilbur, 989 F. Supp. 2d at 1127.  \nSimilarly, the court in Public Defender, 115 So. 3d at 279, held that the public \ndefender’s office could withdraw from representation of indigent defendants \nbecause of structural limitations.  Insufficient funds and the resultant understaffing \nand excessive caseloads created a situation where indigent defendants did not \nreceive assistance of counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment.  Ibid.  Other \ncourts have also concluded that severe structural limitations result in a denial of \nSixth Amendment rights.  See, e.g., New York Cnty. Lawyers’ Ass’n v. State, 196 \nMisc. 2d 761, 790 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2003) (holding statutory rates for assigned \ncounsel unconstitutional as they resulted in denial of counsel and excessive \ncaseloads, among other issues); \n\n- 20 - \nState v. Young, 172 P.3d 138, 144 (N.M. 2007) (holding that inadequate \ncompensation of defense attorneys deprived capital defendants of their Sixth \nAmendment right to counsel). \nStructural limitations can lead to a situation where even a well-intentioned \nand competent lawyer is a merely nominal counsel because the lawyer is unable to \nfulfill the basic obligation of preparing a defense, including conferring with the \ndefendant, investigating the facts of the case, interviewing witnesses, securing \ndiscovery, engaging in motions practice, identifying experts when necessary, and \nsubjecting the evidence to adversarial testing.  As the Supreme Court of Louisiana \nstated, “[w]e know from experience that no attorney can prepare for one felony \ntrial per day, especially if he has little or no investigative, paralegal, or clerical \nassistance.”  State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780, 789 (La. 1993). \nC.  Civil Constructive Denial-Of-Counsel Claims Provide An Important Tool \nFor Remedying Serious Violations Of The Constitutional Right To Counsel \n \nA civil constructive denial-of-counsel claim is an effective way for litigants \nto seek to effectuate the promise of Gideon.  Post-conviction claims cannot provide \nsystemic structural relief that will help fix the problem of under-funded and under-\nresourced public defenders.  The constructive denial-of-counsel claim recognized \nin Hurrell-Harring and Wilbur provides indigent defendants deprived of their \nconstitutional right to counsel with a meaningful tool for pursuing systemic relief.  \nThe Commonwealth Court’s opinion in this case is the only decision the United \n\n- 21 - \nStates is aware of that concludes that a Gideon-based civil action for constructive \ndenial of counsel is not viable at all.  It erects a roadblock that will impede indigent \ndefendants’ ability to vindicate their Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  This \nCourt should remove that roadblock and rule that constructive denial-of-counsel \nclaims are actionable.    \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe judgment of the Commonwealth Court should be reversed.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nLISA FOSTER          VANITA GUPTA \n  Director, Office for Access to Justice     Principal Deputy Assistant \n                  Attorney General \n \n              s/ Nathaniel S.

LAWTON, COUNTY \nMANAGER, in his official capacity, \nDefendants. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nIntroduction \n1.  Plaintiffs file this action against Luzerne County (\"the County\") and its County \n~ \ni \nManager (collectively \"Defendants\") because Defendants have failed to allocate sufficient  !\\ \nresources to provide constitutionally adequate representation for indigent adult criminal \nI \nI \n\ndefendants in the County.  As detailed in this Complaint, this failure has led to a grossly \nunderfunded and thus overwhelmed Office of the Public Defender (\"the OPD\"), resulting in the \nprovision of sub-constitutional representation to many indigent criminal defendants and the \ncomplete deprivation of representation to many others. \n2.  Defendants' deliberate indifference to the funding needs of the OPD has led to a \nvariety of systemic problems, including severe understaffing, that has resulted in lawyers having \noverwhelming workloads and thus being unable to provide the basic elements of constitutionally \nadequate representation. \n3.  The Chief Public Defender and the lawyers in the OPD are dedicated and \ncommitted professionals whose inability to provide constitutionally adequate representation \nstems from the Defendants' failure to provide adequate funding and resources.  Given the \nvolume of work, even the best lawyers would be unable to engage in the basic functions of \nrepresentation, including conferring with clients in a meaningful way prior to critical stages of \ntheir legal proceedings, reviewing client files, conducting discovery, motion practice, and factual \ninvestigation, as well as devoting necessary time to prepare for hearings, trials, and appeals. \n4.  Because of the above deficiencies, on December 19, 2011, the OPD instituted a \npolicy of declining all applications for representation except in cases of homicide, felony sex \noffenses, extraditions, mental health, state parole, county probation/parole revocation, juvenile, \n. \nand incarcerated adult defendants.  As detailed in this Complaint, the OPD was forced to institute \nI \nthis policy because of the Defendants' failure to fund the office adequately, which in turn has led \n~ \nI \nto such high workloads that the OPD lawyers are unable to fulfill their professional, statutory,  I \nI \nand constitutional obligations as defense counsel.  Defendants' failure to provide adequate \nresources for the defense of indigent adult criminal defendants has deprived numerous such  I \n2 \n\ndefendants, including Plaintiffs Sat)lantha Volciak, Yolanda Holman, and Charles Hammonds, of \nrepresentation, thereby violating their right to counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution as well as their right to counsel under the \nPennsylvania Constitution. \n5.  All Plaintiffs seek a Writ of Mandamus ordering the County, as a first step, to lift \na hiring freeze that currently prevents Plaintiff Flora from filling even budgeted attorney \npositions in the OPD and, subsequently, to increase the OPD's funding to such a level that will \npermit the OPD to provide constitutionally adequate representation to all those entitled to \ncounsel under the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. \n6.  Plaintiffs Volciak, Holman and Hammonds also bring this Complaint under the \nCivil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Article I,§ 9 ofthe Pennsylvania Constitution, on behalf \nof themselves and a class of persons who are similarly situated, namely, indigent adults in \nLuzerne County, who have been charged with crimes and are entitled to appointment of counsel, \nbut who have been or will be declined by the OPD because of Defendants' refusal to provide \nsufficient resources to the OPD.  Plaintiffs claim that the County's failure to provide them with \nany representation violates the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions.  Plaintiffs seek mandamus \nand injunctive relief ordering Defendants to allocate funds to allow for the appointment (and \npayment) of private counsel to provide immediate relief, namely, the appointment of competent \ncounsel to represent them in their ongoing criminal proceedings, and, subsequently, to increase \nthe OPD's funding to such a level that will permit the OPD to provide constitutionally adequate \nrepresentation to all those entitled to counsel under the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. \n3 \n\nParties \n7.  Plaintiff AI Flora, Jr. has been the Chief Public Defender in the OPD of Luzerne \nCounty, Pennsylvania since May 2010.  As Chief Public Defender, PlaintiffFlora is responsible \nfor managing the OPD, which includes overseeing its lawyers and employees, establishing its \npo.licies, managing its budget, and ensuring its compliance with constitutional, statutory, and \nprofessional/ethical guidelines. \n8.  Plaintiff Samantha Volciak lives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.  At all times material \nhereto, PlaintiffVolciak was and is a resident of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  Plaintiff \nVolciak is qualified for public representation.  Unfortunately, because Defendants have failed to \nprovide sufficient resources, including lawyers, staff, and investigators, the OPD is unable to \nprovide Plaintiff Volciak with counsel, in violation of her constitutional rights.  As a result, Ms. \nVolciak is utterly without counsel, despite being eligible for public representation. \n9.  Plaintiff Yolanda Holman lives in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania.  At all times \nmaterial hereto, Plaintiff Holman was and is a resident of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  Ms. \nHolman is qualified for public representation.  Unfortunately, because Defendants have failed to \nprovide sufficient resources, including lawyers, staff, and investigators, the OPD is unable to \nprovide Plaintiff Holman with counsel, in violation of her constitutional rights.  As a result, Ms. \nHolman is utterly without counsel, despite being eligible for public representation. \n10.  Plaintiff Charles Hammonds lives in Clairton, Pennsylvania.  At all times material \nhereto, Plaintiff Hammonds was and is a resident of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.  Mr. \nHammonds is qualified for public representation.  Unfortunately, because Defendants have failed \nto provide sufficient resources, including lawyers, staff, and investigators, the OPD is unable to \n4 \n\nprovide Plaintiff Hammonds with counsel, in violation of his constitutional rights.  As a result, \nMr. Hammonds is utterly without counsel, despite being eligible for public representation. \n11.  Plaintiffs Samantha Volciak, Yolanda Holman, and Charles Hammonds are all \nindigent persons who have been charged with crimes by the Luzerne County District Attorney, \nbut who have been declined representation by the OPD because Defendants have not provided \nsufficient resources to that office.  As a result, they are currently without counsel, despite being \neligible for public representation. \n12.  Defendant Luzerne County is a county of the Third Class located in northeastern \nPennsylvania.  Effective January 2, 2012, the County transitioned to Home Rule under the \ngovernance of the present Council.  Prior to January 2012, the County had an elected Board of \nCounty Commissioners (\"the Commissioners\"). \n13.  Defendant Robert C. Lawton is the County Manager of Luzerne County, \nPennsylvania.  The County Manager maintains an office at 200 North River Street, Wilkes-\nBarre, PA  18711.  Defendant Lawton assumed this position on February 29, 2012.  He is sued in \nhis official capacity.  At all times hereinafter mentioned, these defendants were acting within the \nscope of their official duties and under color of state law. \nFacts of the Case \n14.  The Public Defender Act (\"the Act\") requires that every county in Pennsylvania \n(except Philadelphia) appoint a public defender to provide representation for indigent \ncriminal defendants prosecuted in its county.  16 P.S. § 9960.3. \n15.  The Act specifically mandates, \n(a) The public defender shall be responsible for furnishing legal counsel, in the \nfollowing types of cases, to any person who, for lack of sufficient funds, is unable \nto obtain legal counsel: \n5 \n\n(1) Where a person is charged with juvenile delinquency; \n(2) Critical pretrial identification procedures; \n(3) Preliminary hearings; \n( 4) State habeas corpus proceedings; \n(5) State trials, including pretrial and posttrial motions; \n(6) Superior Court appeals; \n(7) Pennsylvania Supreme Court appeals; \n(8) Postconviction hearings, including proceedings at the trial and \nappellate levels; \n(9) Criminal extradition proceedings; \n(1 0) Probation and parole proceedings and revocation thereof; \n(11) In any other situations where [sic] representation is constitutionally \nrequired.  ... \n(c) The public defender, when appointed by the court, shall furnish legal counsel \nto persons who are or may be subject to commitment in a proceeding under the \nact of October 20, 1966 (3rd Sp. Sess., P.L. 96, No.6), known as the \"Mental \nHealth and Mental Retardation Act of 1966.\" \n!d. at§ 9960.6(a), (c). \n16.  The Act presumptively requires that the representation satisfy the constitutional \nstandards set forth in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well \nas analogous provisions in the Pennsylvania Constitution.  See e.g., Gideon v.  Wainwright, \n372 U.S. 335, 339 (1963); Pa. Const. art. I,§ 9. \n17.  The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that, \nwhen a State brings its judicial power to bear on an indigent defendant in a \ncriminal proceeding, it must take steps to assure that the defendant has a fair \nopportunity to present his defense.  This elementary principle, grounded in \nsignificant part on the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guarantee of \nfundamental fairne~s, derives from the beliefthatjustice cannot be equal where, \nsimply as a result of his poverty, a defendant is denied the opportunity to \nparticipate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake. \nAke v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 76 (1985). \n18.  The right to counsel anchors our criminal justice system: \"Without counsel, the \nright to a trial itself would be 'of little avail' .... 'Of all the rights that an accused person \nhas, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability \n6 \n\nto assert any other rights he may have.'\"  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 653-54 \n(1984) (citing Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69 (1932). \n19.  Other courts considering similar litigation have found that violations of the \nconstitutional right to counsel cause harms beyond just unreliable convictions: \"Wrongful \nconvictions, however, are not the only injustices that command our present concern. As \nplaintiffs rightly point out, the absence of representation at critical stages is capable of \ncausing grave and irreparable injury to persons who will not be convicted. Gideon's \nguarantee to the assistance of counsel does not tum upon a defendant's guilt or innocence, \nand neither can the availability of a remedy for its denial.\" Hurrell-Harring v. New York, \n930 N.E.2d 217, 228 (N.Y. 2010) (allowing class action to proceed on allegation that lack of \nfunding resulted in failure to provide legal representation to indigent criminal defendants at \nall critical stages of the proceedings against them). \n20.  Plaintiff Flora is the Chief Public Defender in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  He \nhas been with the OPD as an attorney since 1980.  He became the First Assistant Public \nDefender in 1990 and the acting Chief Public Defender in March 2010.  In May 2010, he was \nappointed the Chief Public Defender by the Luzerne County Board of Commissioners. \n21.  The OPD is divided into two units, the Adult Unit and the Juvenile Unit.  Plaintiff \nFlora oversees both units.  The First Assistant aids Plaintiff Flora in supervising the Adult \nUnit (both Plaintiff Flora and the First Assistant are part-time employees).  The Adult Unit \ncurrently employs thirteen part-time attorneys, four full-time attorneys, three investigators, \nfour secretaries, one receptionist, and one office administrator. 1  One of the part-time \nattorneys handles state parole cases, and another part-time attorney is only assigned capital \n1 The office administrator provides assistance to both the Adult and Juvenile Units. \n7 \n\nand homicide cases.  The Adult Unit presently has five vacant attorney positions, three full-\ntime and two part-time.  These vacancies are the result of three resignations in 2012 (two \nfull-time, one part-time), the 2010 transfer of a full-time attorney from the Adult Unit to the \nJuvenile Unit, and the 2009 resignation of a part-time attorney.  Four of these vacancies \n(three full-time, one part-time) are funded in the 2012 amended Luzerne County budget. \n22.  The Juvenile Unit is fully staffed at present with three full-time attorneys, two \nsocial workers, one investigator, and one secretary. \n23.  The OPD is charged with providing representation to indigent criminal defendants \nin seventeen magisterial districts, the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas, and the state \nappellate courts (as needed).  The OPD is also responsible for providing representation in \nstate parole, county probation/parole revocation, and mental health civil commitment \nproceedings. \n24.  In addition to the OPD, some indigent criminal defendants in Luzerne County are \nrepresented by conflict counsel.  The Luzerne County court system employs eleven part-time \nsalaried attorneys to represent indigent defendants when a conflict of interest prevents the \nOPD from providing representation.  In 2011, the eleven part-time conflict counsel \ncollectively handled 278 cases. \nPlaintiff Flora's Efforts to Improve the OPD \n25.  When PlaintiffFlora became ChiefPublic Defender in May 2010, the OPD was \nalready plagued with problems due to years of insufficient funding.  Plaintiff Flora's \npredecessor Basil Russin had tried in vain since 2007 to secure additional funding for the \nOPD from the County.  From 2007 to 2010, Mr. Russin submitted weekly reports to the \nLuzerne County Board of Commissioners detailing the excessive OPD caseloads and staffing \n8 \n\ndeficiencies, which stemmed from insufficient funding.  The reports also discussed the \nCounty's failure to fill vacancies in a timely fashion. \n26.  Plaintiff Flora's highest priority when he became Chief Public Defender was \nimproving juvenile representation in the wake of the \"kids for cash\" scandal, in which two \njudges of the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas were convicted or pled guilty to \ncharges that they improperly accepted money from two private, for-profit juvenile detention \nfacilities. \n27.  State records reveal that between 2003 and 2008, the time period during which \nthe \"kids for cash\" scandal occurred, approximately 50 percent ofj uveniles appeared in \nLuzerne County Juvenile Court without the benefit of counsel-nearly ten times the state \naverage.  Virtually all of the unrepresented juveniles were adjudicated delinquent.  According \nto the December 2011 report by Joint State Government Commission's Task Force and \nAdvisory Committee on Services to Indigent Criminal Defendants, the OPD was unable to \nprovide effective representation to juveniles during this time because of inadequate \nresources.  Excerpts from the December 2011 report are attached to this Complaint as Exhibit \nA. \n28.  In 2009, the Pennsylvania General Assembly created the Interbranch Commission \non Juvenile Justice to investigate the circumstances that led to the \"kids for cash\" scandal, \nrestore public confidence in the administration ofj ustice, and prevent similar events from \noccurring in Luzerne County or elsewhere in the Commonwealth. \n29.  In May 2010, the Interb ranch Commission released its full report and \nrecommendations.  Its recommendations included the restoration of funding for the Victims \nof Juvenile Offenders program to 2005 levels; the creation of a Luzerne County Victims of \n9 \n\nJuvenile Crime Restitution Fund; the creation of a state-based funding stream for indigent \njuvenile defense; and guaranteed access to defense counsel by deeming all juveniles indigent \nfor purposes of appointing counsel, restricting the right of a juvenile to waive counsel, and \nrequiring stand-by counsel if the juvenile waives counsel. \n30.  As part ofhis efforts to improve the quality ofj uvenile representation, Plaintiff \nFlora was able to obtain grant funding from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and \nDelinquency and the Luzerne-Wyoming Counties Mental Health/Mental Retardation \nProgram.  These grants allowed Plaintiff Flora to create a separate Juvenile Unit by hiring \none attorney, two social workers, one secretary, and one investigator to exclusively handle \n' \n·l \n,j \nl \njuvenile cases. \n1 \n31.  Even with this grant funding, Plaintiff Flora was also forced to transfer a senior \nattorney from the Adult Unit to meet the staffing needs in the Juvenile Unit.  Defendants \nhave refused to authorize Plaintiff Flora to replace this attorney in the Adult Unit, despite the \nfact that funding for the position exists in the current budget. \n32.  With a full complement of staff in the Juvenile Unit, Plaintiff Flora has been able \nto implement a comprehensive process for handling juvenile cases and determining juvenile \neligibility for OPD representation.  The Juvenile Unit is now a model unit that has earned \naccolades from across the state and has been recognized by the Pennsylvania Commission on \nCrime and Delinquency as a \"Model\" Juvenile Defender Unit for the state.  The senior \nattorney in the Juvenile Unit is a member of the Board of Directors of the Juvenile Defenders \nAssociation of Pennsylvania (\"JDAP\").  The Juvenile Unit adheres to JDAP's Performance \nGuidelines for Quality and Effective Juvenile Delinquency Representation.  With the \nresources provided by outside grant funding and the County, the OPD has been able to \n10 \n\nintervene in juvenile cases at an early stage, thereby diverting these cases from court and \npreserving the resources of the Juvenile Unit, the County, and the judiciary. 2 \n33.  Despite the success of the Juvenile Unit, the County has refused to provide \nPlaintiff Flora with the necessary resources to make similar and badly needed improvements \nto the Adult Unit. \n34.  In June 2010, Plaintiff Flora provided Defendant County and its Commissioners \nwith a report relating the significant resource shortfall at the OPD and its consequent inability \nto provide the representation required by the Public Defender Act and the U.S. and \nPennsylvania Constitutions.  The OPD's listed deficiencies included: \n1.  Caseloads for OPD attorneys that far exceed national maximum caseload \nstandards; \nn.  An insufficient number of clerical staff; \nm.  The County's failure to fill staff vacancies; \niv.  The lack of any appellate counsel, resulting in staff lawyers, many ofwhom are \nnot versed or trained in appellate practice, doing their own appeals; \nv.  Physical facilities that are undersized, overcrowded, poorly maintained and not \nsuitable for client conferences or maintaining client confidentiality; and \nv1.  Severely inadequate information technology. \n35.  At the conclusion of his report, Plaintiff Flora stated, \"[a]bsent appropriate staff \nincreases, the Office will begin declining applications for representation within 60 days.\" \nPlaintiff Flora's June 2010 report is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit B. \n36.  In July 2010, Plaintiff Flora provided Defendant County and its Commissioners \nwith a short-term plan to correct the OPD's staffing deficiencies and the resulting problems. \n2 Plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutional adequacy of the representation provided by the \nOPD's Juvenile Unit at this time. \n11 \n\nRecommendations included the creation of a Juvenile Unit, hiring appellate and additional \ntrial attorneys, and active caseload monitoring. Plaintiff Flora's July 2010 plan is attached to \nthis Complaint as Exhibit C. \n37 .  In his 2011 budget proposal, Plaintiff Flora recommended hiring two attorneys to \nhandle appeals because the trial attorneys, who had (and still have) little to no appellate \nexperience, were responsible for their own appeals.  He noted in his request that hiring two \nfull-time appellate attorneys would \"alleviate [sic] serious deficiencies in appellate practice \nin office and minimize county exposure to ineffective counsel claims ....\"   He also stated \nthe need for an additional investigator and a secretary \"to help alleviate staffing/caseload \nproblems and provide better ratio of lawyers to support staff to insure effective assistance of \ncounsel.\" The Commissioners denied his requests. \n38.  Plaintiff Flora's 2012 budget again requested two appellate lawyers, along with \ntwo secretaries, to start rectifying the severe staffing shortage in the Office. \nCurrently office has no appellate lawyers creating significant ethical issues \nfor supervisory counsel.  Two appellate lawyers would bring office into \ncompliance with ABA standards on Public Defense Delivery Systems as \nrelating to appeals.  Office still understaffed on adult side re: trial lawyers \nand does not meet ABA standards.  Two additional secretaries seriously \nneeded on adult side given large volume of cases.  Currently, office has 4 \nclerk steno's on adult side with each steno handling over 1,000 cases per \nyear.  Adequate support staff essential to allow counsel to [sic] perform \nduties effectively. \nPlaintiff Flora's requests were once more denied. \n3 9.  Because of Defendants' refusal to provide minimum funding and resources to the \nOPD, Plaintiff Flora was forced to take action in order to provide constitutionally adequate \ncriminal defense to at least some indigent defendants in Luzerne County. \n12 \n\nThe Public Defender's Office Has Been Forced To Decline Cases In Order To Comply With \nEthical Rules And Professional Standards \n40.  On December 12, 2011, Plaintiff Flora sent a letter to the President Judge of the \nLuzerne County Court of Common Pleas stating that he would begin declining certain cases \non December 19, 2011, because of a lack of OPD resources. \n41.  Beginning on December 19th, the OPD started declining cases, advising \ndefendants in writing that although they were eligible for counsel, the OPD could not \naccommodate their request due to a lack of resources.  The OPD currently approves new \napplications for representation only from indigent adult defendants with homicide or felony \nsex offense charges, or individuals who are incarcerated or subject to extradition. The OPD \nalso continues to provide representation to individuals in mental health, state parole, county \nprobation/parole revocation, and juvenile cases.  The OPD has continued representation in all \ncases that the OPD was handling before December 19,2011. \n42.  To date, the Office has declined representation to over three hundred (300) \neligible criminal defendants. \n43.  To date, conflict counsel have not been appointed to represent defendants whom \nthe OPD has declined to represent as a result of the December 19, 2011 policy.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the Court does not have sufficient resources to provide conflict \ncounsel for so many defendants. \n44.  Plaintiff Flora's policy to limit new cases to address excessive workloads is \nI_ \nnecessary in light of the ethical and constitutional rules under which Plaintiff Flora and the \nOPD operate.  His policy is required by the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct and \nis in full compliance with the ethical guidance provided by the American Bar Association. \nI \n13 \ni \n• \n• \n\n45.  Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 states that \"[a] lawyer shall \nprovide competent representation to a client.  Competent representation requires the legal \nknowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\" \nPlaintiff Flora's policy is necessary to ensure that attorneys provide clients with \nrepresentation involving sufficient preparation and thoroughness to satisfy the requirements \nofRule 1.1. \n46.  Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 5.1 states that \"[a] lawyer having \ndirect supervisory authority over another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that \nthe other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\" Plaintiff Flora's policy is \nnecessary to ensure that the attorneys over whom Plaintiff Flora has supervisory authority \ncomply with Rule 1.1. \n4 7.  American Bar Association Ethics Opinion 06-441 states that the Rules of \nProfessional Conduct relating to competency \"provide no exception for lawyers who \nrepresent indigent persons charged with crimes.\" \n48.  American Bar Association Ethics Opinion 06-441 also provides that \"[a] lawyer>s \nprimary ethical duty is owed to existing clients. Therefore, a lawyer must decline to accept \nnew cases, rather than withdraw from existing cases, if the acceptance of a new case will \nresult in her workload becoming excessive.\" \n49.  American Bar Association Ethics Opinion 06-441 further states that \"[i]fany \nsubordinate lawyer's workload is found to be excessive, the supervisor should take whatever \nadditional steps are necessary to ensure that the subordinate lawyer is able to meet her ethical \nobligations in regard to the representation of her clients.\" \n14 \n\n50.  In January 2012, Luzerne County reopened its budget pursuant to its transition to \nHome Rule.  The Interim County Manager gave all county offices a bottom-line figure within \nwhich to allocate their funding.  The OPD was given $2.36 million, a nearly twelve percent \n(12%) decrease from its $2.68 million 2011 budget. The loss in funds would have required \nthe OPD to cut four positions, jeopardizing the adequate staffmg in the Juvenile Unit as some \nof its employees would have had to be shifted to the Adult Unit. \n51.  After the Council approved a two-percent tax increase, Plaintiff Flora was able \nrearrange his new allotment of$2.5 million (a 6.7% decrease from 2011) to maintain current \nstaffing levels.  Preserving existing positions in the OPD required Plaintiff Flora to reduce \nhis expert witness budget from $100,000 to $72,000.  (The OPD spent approximately \n$170,000 on expert witnesses in 2011.) This budget reduction will have a substantial impact \non the OPD's ability to retain experts in capital and juvenile cases, both ofwhich frequently \nrequire expert testimony.  The OPD will likely have to petition the Court to direct the County \nto pay expert fees once the OPD has exceeded its budget for this expense. \n52.  Plaintiff Flora submitted his new budget under protest, declaring \nCurrent staffing levels and existing caseloads, prevent this office from \nproviding level of representation required by ethical standards and by \nFederal and State Constitutions.  As such, office is ethically required to \nwithdraw from existing cases or refuse new cases.  Letter of January 3, \n2012 from American Council of Chief Defenders to County Council \nsupports position.  Budget submitted in protest for reasons as already stated \nin previous memos and reports to County and Court.  Cannot reduce \nstaffing any further. \n53.  In February 2012, the Interim Manager permitted Plaintiff Flora to advertise the \nthree funded attorney vacancies in the Adult Unit.3  As the County had instituted a hiring \n3 \nThere are currently four funded vacancies due to the March 27, 2012 resignation of a full-time \nattorney in the Adult Unit. \n15 \n\nfreeze in February 2012, the Interim Manager did not allow Plaintiff Flora to fill these \nvacancies.  Defendant Lawton, the new County Manager, has also not permitted Plaintiff \nFlora to fill these vacancies. \n54.  On February 28, 2012, Plaintiff Flora sent a letter to the President Judge ofthe \nLuzerne County Court of Common Pleas requesting \"the court's immediate assistance ... to \nassign outside or conflict counsel to provide representation in [mental health] cases.\" The \npart-time attorney who handled mental health cases resigned on February 20, 2012, and \nanother attorney, largely untrained in mental health law, has been temporarily assigned to \nthese cases.  This is one of the four funded vacancies that Plaintiff Flora is seeking to fill. \n55.  On March 16, 2012, one ofthe OPD's part-time attorneys advised Plaintiff Flora \nthat he would no longer accept cases that had been reassigned due to current or upcoming \nvacancies. The attorney stated that he could not provide ethical representation to indigent \ndefendants if he added more cases to his already heavy workload.  Even with the December \n19,2011 policy in effect for three months, this part-time attorney had approximately 115 \nopen cases as ofMarch 16, 2012. \nCurrent State of the Luzerne County Public Defender's Office \n56.  National standards and Rules of Professional Responsibility define proper legal \nrepresentation to indigent criminal defendants at all critical stages of the proceedings against \nthem as requiring, among other things, that defense counsel: (a) have adequate knowledge of \nthe relevant areas of the law; (b) be assigned to their clients as early in the criminal, \ndelinquency, or mental health proceeding as possible; (c) be present at every critical stage of \ntheir clients' proceedings; (d) conduct reasonable factual and legal pre-trial investigations \ninto the charges against their clients, pursue available formal and informal discovery \n16 \n\nprocedures, and use appropriate and necessary experts; (e) consult with their clients to elicit \nrelevant information about the case, to inform clients of their rights, and to enable clients to \nmake informed decisions about the direction of their cases; and (f) perform their work with \nreasonable diligence and promptness. \n57.  Because Defendants have refused to provide the necessary funding and resources, \nthe OPD cannot provide representation that satisfies the above standards and therefore cannot \nprovide legal representation to indigent criminal defendants at all critical stages of the \nproceedings against them in accordance with its constitutional, statutory, and professional \nobligations. \n(a) Adequate Knowledge oft he Relevant Law \n58.  The OPD does not have the resources to provide adequate training to its Adult \nUnit attorneys.  No formal introductory or basic training is provided to new attorneys at the \noutset of their work at the OPD.  The only form of in-service training for junior-level \nattorneys is a mentoring program where senior attorneys provide guidance on cases. New \nlawyers also handle a lighter casel oad for their first six months to a year.  Plaintiff Flora has \nbeen able to secure some advanced training for Juvenile Unit attorneys by applying for \nscholarships and free training from organizations that focus on juvenile defense. \n59.  Pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 801, an attorney who \nwishes to be qualified to try capital cases must take a minimum of 18 credits of advanced \ntraining within a three-year period.  Currently, attorneys in the OPD pay for this specialized \ntraining out of their own pockets. \nI \n60.  The OPD does not have any designated attorneys to handle appeals. \nI \nConsequently, trial attorneys with little or no appellate experience are responsible for any \nI \nJ \n17 \n\nappeals that arise out of their casel oads.  Because of the complexity and time investment \ninherent in properly handling appeals, attorneys sometimes miss deadlines.  When a deadline \nis missed, the attorney must seek leave from the local court to file nunc pro tunc. \nFortunately, this leave has often been granted.  In other instances, appeals have been \ndismissed for failure to file docketing statements, 1925(b) statements, or for failure to file \nbriefs.  Most OPD attorneys are unfamiliar with the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate \nProcedure and are otherwise unable to comply with appellate requirements.  Moreover, since \nappeals are exceedingly time-consuming, these cases detract from the attorneys' efforts on \nbehalf of other clients whom they represent. \n61.  The OPD currently does not have a lawyer trained to handle mental health cases, \nfor which the OPD must provide representation pursuant to the Public Defender Act.  16 P.S. \n§ 9960.6(c).  The attorney who was trained to handle these cases resigned in February 2012. \nThe attorney currently handling these cases shadowed the former attorney for a few weeks \nbefore he left the OPD, but does not have any other training in mental health law and \nconsequently cannot provide adequate representation for the clients in these cases. \n(b) Early Assignment to Clients \n62.  The OPD is unable to provide representation or support at preliminary \narraignments, which the U.S. Supreme Court recently reaffirmed to be the point at which the \nright to counsel attaches.  See Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U.S. 191, 213 (2008) (\"[A] \ncriminal defendant's initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge \nagainst him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the start of adversary judicial \nproceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\")  The right to \ncounsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution attaches at the same time as the right to counsel \n18 \n\nprovided by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Commonwealth \nv. Arroyo, 723 A.2d 162, 170 (Pa. 1999). \n(c) Present at all Critical Stages of Clients' Proceedings \n63.  The heavy caseloads regularly lead to scheduling conflicts, causing attorneys to \nrequest continuances of critical proceedings.  These continuances can lead to clients \nremaining in pre-trial detention for longer periods than necessary. \n64.  The heavy caseloads also frequently result in the OPD attorneys' inability to \nconsult with their clients prior to each stage of their case.  Consequently, OPD attorneys \nparticipate in many stages of their clients' criminal proceedings without a full understanding \nof the facts and potential strategies for the case. \n(d) Conducting Reasonable Factual Investigations and Discovery \n65.  OPD attorneys are often unable to conduct any discovery prior to the pre-trial \nhearing.  When discovery is obtained, the attorneys are frequently unable to review the \ninformation.  If discovery responses are inadequate or incomplete, attorneys rarely have time \nto follow up to obtain complete information.  The performance guidelines promulgated by \nthe National Legal Aid & Defender Association (\"NLADA Guidelines\") state that attorneys \nin criminal cases have a duty to pursue discovery as soon as practicable.  Such discovery is \nnecessary because it can provide exculpatory information, help develop defenses to criminal \ncharges, and assist the attorney in developing a theory of the case. The absence of pre-trial \ninvestigation is the equivalent of the denial of counsel at a critical juncture in these \ndefendants' proceedings. \ni \n66.  OPD attorneys also rarely have time to conduct the necessary fact inquiry and  I \ninvestigation prior to preliminary hearings.  Depending on the case, public defenders should \nI \nI \nI \n19 \n\ninterview witnesses or otherwise gather additional facts prior to the preliminary hearing to \nobtain basic information about the case.  They should furthermore arrange for the creation of \nthe preliminary hearing transcript.  Obtaining transcripts of preliminary hearings is necessary \nto ensure that a defendant can utilize any helpful statements or admissions made during the \nhearing in later stages of the defendant's criminal case. \n67.  The Adult Unit of the OPD has an insufficient number of investigators given the \namount of cases it handles and the number of staff attorneys it employs.  Investigators play a \nvital role in providing constitutionally adequate representation to indigent defendants because \npublic defenders generally do not have time to conduct case investigations.  The OPD \ncurrently employs three investigators to assist twenty-one attorneys (including the four \nfunded vacancies) in the Adult Unit with over 4,000 new cases per year, plus cases carried \nover from the previous year.  By contrast, the Luzerne County District Attorney's Office in \n2010 had ten detectives assisting twenty-six attorneys.  Thus, each investigator in the OPD \nmust assist more than twice as many attorneys as a detective in the District Attorney's Office. \n68.  Moreover, because the OPD does not have a case manager or adequate support \nstaff, the investigators must assume many responsibilities that detract from the amount of \ntime they can commit to investigations.  All of the investigators assist with inputting \ninformation into the case management system, updating files prior to preliminary hearings \n(including obtaining copies of criminal complaints and probable cause affidavits from \nI \nmagistrates), picking up discovery from the District Attorney's office, and conducting a daily \nI \nmail run to the courthouse.  They also cover the front desk when the receptionist or other \nsecretaries are unavailable, assist with filing, contact magistrates' offices for new preliminary \n20 \n\nhearing dates, and input full-time attorney assignments into Microsoft Outlook.  In fact, one \nof the investigators spends the majority of her time on administrative tasks. \n69.  The OPD's expert budget is severely underfunded.  The OPD exceeded its \n$100,000 expert budget in 2011 by approximately $70,000, but was forced to cut this line \nitem to $72,000 in 2012 to prevent layoffs.  It is unlikely that the OPD will be able to provide \nadequate counsel in all its cases while adhering to this expert budget given the increasing role \nof forensics, particularly DNA testing, in criminal cases.  Expert expenses are likely to be \nparticularly high in capital cases, where mitigation and mental health experts are necessary in \nvirtually every case.  Mental health experts are typically required in juvenile cases as well. \n(e)  Consulting with Clients \n70.  The OPD's office lacks sufficient space to conduct intake interviews in private \nareas.  Client interviews therefore frequently take place in public spaces where they can be \noverheard by staff in the office as well as any visitors in the reception area, thereby \ncompromising client confidentiality. \n71.  The OPD's office also lacks the resources to conduct in-person intake interviews \nat prison facilities.  Instead, investigators interview incarcerated clients via video.  These \ninterviews are conducted while prison staff and other inmates are in the room with the client. \nThis lack of confidentiality affects the questions that can be asked and the value of the \ninterview. \n72.  Furthermore, OPD attorneys do not have time to meet with clients before \npreliminary hearings, except in certain instances for a few minutes immediately prior to the \nhearings in a non-secure area of a district magistrate's office.  These brief meetings are not \nsufficient to gather information about a case to provide constitutionally adequate \n21 \n\nrepresentation.  Pre-hearing interviews are supposed to allow attorneys to develop at least a \ncursory understanding of the facts of the case and any available defenses.  The attorney \nshould also use this first meeting to fulfill his or her obligation to advise the client about the \ncriminal justice process and to caution the client about not inadvertently waiving rights, such \nas by making non-privileged communications to non-attorneys. \n73.  In Luzerne County, incarcerated indigent criminal defendants often participate in \ntheir preliminary hearings via video from prison, instead of being transported to the \nmagistrate's office for in-person participation.  When this occurs, any consultation between \nthe OPD attorney and the client must take place via video, in open court, with no opportunity \nfor confidential discussion.  In some cases, OPD attorneys negotiate plea deals at the \npreliminary hearing.  When this occurs, the attorneys do not have any opportunity to consult \nconfidentially with their clients regarding the plea agreement, its terms, or expected \nconsequences, as the communications between client and counsel can be heard by the court \nand the prosecutor.  Any questions the client has must be asked publicly.  These incarcerated \ndefendants are therefore deprived of any opportunity to obtain confidential counsel regarding \ntheir agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges. \n74.  The attorneys are often unable, due to their overwhelming workloads, to contact \ntheir clients at any point between the preliminary hearing and the status conference, which is \ngenerally scheduled at least three months after the preliminary hearing. \n75.  In addition, the attorneys are often unable, again because of overwhelming \nworkloads, to contact their clients at any point between the status conference and the pre-trial \nhearing, which is generally held approximately one month after the status conference. \n22 \n\n76.  In fact, the attorneys are often unable to conduct meaningful and comprehensive \ninterviews with clients until the eve of trial, if the case proceeds that far. \n77.  OPD attorneys are often unable to meet with clients prior to sentencing hearings. \nThey frequently lack adequate time to engage in advance preparation for sentencing, which \ninvolves obtaining letters of support or other mitigation materials and submitting written \nstatements in cases presenting serious legal or factual issues regarding sentencing.  OPD \nattorneys typically review the pre-sentencing report at or shortly before the actual hearing. \nAs a result, the ability to effectively advocate at sentencing is seriously compromised. \n78.  In addition, OPD attorneys are unable to file notes of all meetings and log all \ntelephone conversations with clients and witnesses. \n79.  Overall, OPD attorneys are unable to maintain regular contact with their clients \nand to follow up on client attempts to communicate with them.  Regular contact is mandated \nby professional standards, and failure to maintain such contact constitutes inadequate counsel \nas it leaves the attorney without sufficient information to assess the prosecution's case or \nanalyze discovery and impairs factual analysis and the development of defenses.  It also \nprejudices plea negotiations by leaving the attorney without critical information necessary to \nmake judgments and provide counsel to the client. \n(f)  Performing Work with Reasonable Diligence and Promptness \n80.  In addition to serious problems with client communication and lack of \ninvestigation and discovery, OPD attorneys are unable to perform their work with reasonable \ndiligence and promptness in other ways. \n81.  Pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 579, attorneys are required \nto file an Omnibus Pretrial Motion within 30 days after arraignment.  Because of their \ni \n• \n23 \n\nexcessive workloads, OPD attorneys often file these motions late and/or based upon \nincomplete information due to a lack of investigation and discovery. \n82.  Due to their massive caseloads, OPD attorneys are unable to familiarize \nthemselves sufficiently with their clients' cases before the pre-trial hearing.  The pre-trial \nhearing is often the last meaningful opportunity to negotiate a plea and avoid trial.  Nor can \nOPD attorneys, without having had an opportunity to confer with the client, discuss the case, \nengage in discovery, file pre-trial motions, and, if needed, utilize an investigator to meet with \nwitnesses, canvass crime scenes, and secure 9-1-1 tapes, surveillance videos, and the like. \n83.  If no plea agreement is reached at the pre-trial hearing, then OPD attorneys begin \ntrial preparation in earnest.  By this time, however, it may be too late to provide effective \ncounsel as damaging evidence cannot be suppressed and crucial witnesses and evidence may \nhave disappeared.  In short, OPD attorneys simply do not have the time for necessary trial \npreparation and strategy. \n(g) Excessive Workloads \n84.  OPD attorneys are unable to provide constitutionally adequate representation \nbecause of the workloads that overwhelm the Adult Unit and impact every aspect ofthe \nOPD's operations. \n85.  The American Bar Association has stated that full-time attorney caseloads should \nnot exceed 150 felonies, 400 misdemeanors, 200 mental health cases, or 25 appeals per year. \n86.  In 2011, the OPD's office received well over 4,000 new adult applications, of \nwhich approximately 250 were rejected for lack of indigency and 278 were forwarded to \nconflict counsel.  In addition to applications from adult indigent defendants, OPD attorneys \nare directly appointed to cases by county judges. \n24 \n\n87.  The OPD generally handles over 4,000 new criminal cases per year (4,065 in \n2011 and 4,187 in 2010).  Of this total, well in excess of2,000 are felony cases.  In addition, \nmore than 1,000 pending cases carry over from the previous year (1,475 from 2010 and 1,350 \nfrom 2009). \n88.  In addition to the 4,065 cases noted above, the OPD also litigated 23 adult \nsentence appeals, 4 79 mental health cases and appeals, and 64 state parole cases and appeals \nin 2011.  The mental health and state parole cases were each handled by one part-time \nattorney who specializes in that area of the law. \n89.  Including appeals, state parole, and mental health cases, the OPD thus handled a \ntotal of 4,631 new cases in 2011.  If the currently funded vacancies were filled, the OPD \nwould have the equivalent of 14 full-time attorneys.  The average caseload would therefore \nbe approximately 331 cases per attorney based on 2011 caseload data.  Using this same \nanalysis with 2010 casel oad data, the average would be approximately 340 cases per \nattorney.  With carryover cases, the per attorney caseloads would be 436 and 437, \nrespectively.  Since none of the attorneys handle a caseload comprised entirely, or even \nprimarily, of misdemeanors, these caseloads well exceed the maximum caseload standards \nset by the American Bar Association.  I \n90.  Despite the fact that the caseloads handled by OPD attorneys regularly exceed \nAmerican Bar Association guidelines, these caseloads do not fully reflect the workload that \nconfronts OPD attorneys, especially the full-time attorneys. \n91.  Each OPD attorney has substantial responsibilities beyond the normal caseload. \nIn addition to their regular caseloads, the full-time attorneys back up the part-time attorneys \nand handle warrant, bail, and miscellaneous hearings.  They are also assigned homicide cases \n25 \n\nperiodically.  The part-time attorneys are sometimes assigned to homicide cases as well, \nwhich are extraordinarily time-intensive and require two attorneys per case. \n92.  The OPD's full-time attorneys are also responsible for county probation/parole \nrevocation proceedings.  In 2011, there were 1, 172 of these proceedings. 4  These hearings are \ncritical stages of a criminal case and can lead to substantial prison sentences, thus requiring \nefforts on behalf of counsel similar to those that should be made at sentencing. \n93.  Furthermore, OPD attorneys must devote a substantial amount of time to work-\nrelated travel since most of the attorneys are assigned to cover preliminary hearings in one or \ntwo magisterial districts with the full-time attorneys also rotating to cover Central Court in \nWilkes-Barre.  Luzerne County's seventeen magisterial districts are spaced as far as 40 miles \napart from one another. \n94.  Not only do OPD caseloads exceed ABA standards, but they are excessive \ncompared to the caseloads of public defender attorneys in comparable Pennsylvania counties. \nFor example, the Berks County Public Defender's Office had 24 full-time attorneys handling \nI \n4,900 adult and juvenile cases for a per attorney caseload of approximately 204 in 2009. The \nDauphin County Public Defender managed 6,000 adult and juvenile cases in 2009 with 23  ~ \nfull-time attorneys for about 261 cases per attorney.  During the same period, the Lancaster \nI \nCounty Public Defender had the equivalent of 26 full-time attorneys handling 6,200 adult and \njuvenile cases for a per attorney caseload of approximately 238. \n(h) Additional Problems Due to Insufficient Funding \n95.  The Adult Unit has no social workers, paralegals, or trial assistants to assist the \nattorneys in adequately preparing their cases at various stages.  By comparison, the District \n4 These proceedings are included in the 2011 and 2010 new case totals discussed above. \n26 \n\n. \ni \nAttorney's Office in 2010 had 6 trial assistants, I case manager, and 7 victim coordinators in \n' \naddition to its attorneys, investigators, and clerical staff. \n}, \n96.  The OPD also has an insufficient amount of clerical staff.  Currently, a \nreceptionist and 4 secretaries assist 21 attorneys (including funded vacancies).  Thus, each \nsecretary is assigned to 4 or 5 attorneys.  Given the caseloads of the attorneys, it is \nimpossible for the secretaries to adequately assist all the attorneys to which they are assigned. \nIn contrast, the District Attorney's Office in 2010 had 1 executive secretary, 10 clerk typists, \nand 1 administrative assistant.  With 26 assistant district attorneys, the ratio of lawyers to \nclerk typists was less than 3 to 1.  In 2009, the York County Public Defender's Office had 7 \nlegal assistants, plus 2 prison liaisons, for 19 full-time attorneys.  Dauphin County had 4 \nsecretaries, 4 paralegals, and a law clerk for 23 full-time attorneys, and Lancaster County had \n8 secretaries for 27 attorneys. \n97.  The OPD lacks appropriate scheduling software to keep track of important case \ndeadlines and provide reminders.  Due to their massive workloads, OPD attorneys sometimes \nface scheduling conflicts because they are supposed to appear in both a magisterial and a \nCommon Pleas courtroom simultaneously.  In other instances, attorneys may be scheduled to \nI \nappear in two different magisterial districts at the same time.  Inadequate scheduling software \nI \nonly exacerbates this problem. \n98.  The OPD lacks an appropriate computerized data or case management system to \ntrack cases and provide meaningful breakdowns of attorney caseloads. \nI \n99.  Many attorneys do not have their own desks or workspaces.  Plaintiff Flora and \n~ \nI \nthe office administrator are the only individuals with dedicated offices.  All other OPD \nI \nemployees share rooms, cubicles, or whatever space is available. \nr \n27 \n\n100.  The OPD lacks the necessary equipment to enable attorneys to adequately \nrepresent their clients.  Between the two units, eight attorneys have no computers and ten \nhave desktop computers with an older operating system.  The Adult Unit does not have a \nscanner, which is particularly problematic given the growing trend of electronic court filings. \nFinally, the OPD does not possess any audio/visual equipment for trial presentations. \n10 1.  Due to the time-consuming caseloads, Plaintiff Flora and his First Assistant are \nunable to provide consistent, ongoing supervision of the attorneys.  Supervision and \noversight occur only when a serious issue is brought to the attention of Plaintiff Flora. \n10 2.  As a result, the Adult Unit does not have any performance standards or guidelines \nfor its attorneys.  Given the lack of resources and associated excessive workloads in the \nOPD, Adult Unit attorneys would frankly be incapable of complying with any substantive \nstandards or guidelines that Plaintiff Flora would institute. \n103.  The NLADA Performance Guidelines require criminal defense attorneys, in part: \na.  To have \"sufficient time, resources, knowledge and experience to offer quality \nrepresentation to a defendant in a particular matter .... (and] to keep the client \ninformed of the progress of the case ....\"   Guideline 1.3. \nb.  To engage in an initial interview with their clients.  During this interview, the \nd \nI \nattorney is expected to \"be familiar with the elements of the offense and the \npotential punishment, where the charges against the client are already known\" and \nto have obtained all available relevant documents.  Guideline 2.2. \nc.  To appear at the arraignment.  Guideline 3.1.  f \nI \nd.  To be familiar with the facts of the case prior to appearing at the preliminary \nhearing.  Guideline 3.2. \nI \n28 \n\ne.  To promptly conduct an independent investigation of the facts of the case, \nincluding interviewing witnesses and retaining experts, when necessary. \nGuideline 4.1. \nf.  To pursue formal and informal discovery as soon as practicable.  Guideline 4.2. \ng.  To file a variety of pretrial motions, when appropriate.  Guidelines 5.1-5.3. \nh.  To engage in comprehensive trial preparation.  Guideline 7 .1. \n104.  OPD attorneys are clearly unable to meet the NLADA Performance Guidelines \n. \ndue to the excessive workloads they face.  . \n1 \n105.  The December 2011 report by the Joint State Government Commission's Task \nForce and Advisory Committee on Services to Indigent Criminal Defendants found that the \nOPD is operating under excessive workloads and would require an additional 8.5 full-time \nattorneys to meet nationally recognized standards.  This number does not account for the four \n( 4) funded vacancies in the Adult Unit that Plaintiff Flora has not been authorized to fill. \n106.  Given the demands placed on the OPD beyond its criminal caseload numbers, the \nOPD would need more than 8.5 additional full-time attorneys to fulfill its constitutional and \nstatutory obligations. \nClass Action Allegations \n107.  Pursuant to Rule 1701, et seq., of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, \nPlaintiffs Samantha Volciak, Yolanda Holman, and Charles Hammonds bring this action on \nbehalf of themselves and a class of all other similarly situated persons who are or will in the \nfuture be adversely affected by the unlawful and unconstitutional practices of Defendants and  I \nwho seek equitable relief from the Defendants' failure to ensure that the OPD is able to  I \n29 \n\nprovide constitutionally adequate assistance of counsel to all those individuals eligible for \nand entitled to its services. \n108.  The class consists of all persons who have been or will be charged with criminal \noffenses in Luzerne County who qualify for public representation but who have been or will \nbe refused representation by the OPD due to the Defendants' refusal to provide necessary \nfunding and resources to enable the OPD to meet ethical, legal, and constitutional standards \nof representation. \n109.  The requirements of Rule 1702 are met in that: \na.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, as there are \napproximately three hundred (300) members of the class. \nb.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class.  Specifically, each \nmember has been deprived of his or her right to counsel, guaranteed by the U.S. \nand Pennsylvania Constitutions, as a result of Defendants' failure to provide the \nlegally required adequate system of indigent defense. \nc.  The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class. \nd.  The representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the \ninterests of the class. \ne.  A class action provides a fair and efficient method for adjudication of this  I \ncontroversy pursuant to the criteria established by Rule 1708.  Specifically: \n1.  Trying these actions separately would create a risk of inconsistent and \nincompatible adjudications with respect to individual members of the \nclass. \n30 \n\nu.  No litigation has been commenced by or against members of the class \ninvolving the same issues. \nCommon questions of law and fact predominate over any questions \n111. \naffecting individual members. \niv.  Luzerne County is an appropriate forum for the litigation of the claims of \nthe entire class, as each class member has been charged with a crime in \nLuzerne County and has been denied their right to counsel, guaranteed by \nthe U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions, by Defendants Luzerne County \nand Luzerne County Manager. \nv.  The class is numerous enough to render joinder of all members or the \nmaintenance of separate suits impracticable, and the difficulties likely to \nbe encountered in the management of this action as a class action are \nminimal. \nvi.  Defendants have refused to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nmembers of the class. \n110.  The representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the \ninterests of the class pursuant to Rule 1709, in that: \na.  Attorneys for the representative parties are experienced in class action litigation \nand will adequately represent the interests of the class. \nb.  The representative parties do not have a conflict of interest in the maintenance of \nthe class action. \n31 \n\n'-· \nc.  The attorneys are representing the parties pro bono.  The attorneys for the \nrepresentative parties have adequate financial resources to assure that the interests \nof the class will not be harmed. \nClass Representative Samantha Volciak \n111.  Named Plaintiff Samantha Volciak is a lifelong resident of Luzerne County and is \ncurrently a full-time student at Bloomsburg University.  Ms. Volciak is studying English and \naspires to be a teacher.  Ms. Volciak has nearly completed her degree. She needs only one \nmore semester of classroom work and a period of student teaching before she can graduate. \n112.  On December 27, 2011, Samantha Volciak was charged by mail with DUI \nGeneral Impairment-Incapable of Safe Driving under 75 Pa. C.S.A. § 3802(a)(l), DUI High \nRate Alcohol-BAC .10 to .159 under 75 Pa. C.S.A. § 3802(b), and Back Up Vehicle \nImproperly under 75 Pa. C.S.A. § 3702(a). \n113.  Samantha Volciak applied to the OPD for legal assistance on January 4, 2012.  On \nJanuary 9, 2012, the OPD notified Ms. Volciak that although she qualified for public \ndefender representation, the OPD had to deny her application at that time because it lacked \nthe necessary resources to provide her with adequate assistance of counsel as required by \nlaw.  Ms. Volciak is currently without counsel. \n114.  Ms. Volciak is experiencing ongoing harm as a consequence of the denial of her \nconstitutional right to counsel.  An attorney capable of providing the adequate defense to \nwhich Ms. Volciak is entitled would inquire into the facts, investigate the allegations, \nincluding the interviewing of witnesses, consider and file necessary pre-trial motions, \nconsider sentencing mitigation and alternatives, counsel the client about the process and her \nrights, fight for a favorable plea agreement, and, if the case cannot be pled, prepare a  I \nconstitutionally vigorous defense. \nI \n32 \n1 \n\nClass Representative Yolanda Holman \n115.  Named Plaintiff Yolanda Holman is a wedded mother of four children and has \nbeen a resident of Luzerne County for five and one-half years. \n116.  On November 18, 2.()11, the Office oflnspector General charged Yolanda Holman \nwith Fraudulently Obtaining Food Stamps/Assistance under 62 P.S. § 48l(a). \n117.  Yolanda Holman applied for legal assistance through the OPD on January 5, \n2012.  On January 5, 2012, the OPD notified Ms. Holman that although she qualified for \npublic defender representation, the OPD had to deny her application at that time because it \nlacked the necessary resources to provide her with adequate assistance of counsel as required \nby law.  Ms. Holman is currently without counsel. \n118.  Ms. Holman is experiencing ongoing harm as a consequence of the denial of her \nconstitutional right to counsel.  An attorney capable of providing the adequate defense to \nwhich Ms. Holman is entitled would inquire into the facts, investigate the allegations, \nincluding the interviewing of witnesses, consider and file necessary pre-trial motions, \nconsider sentencing mitigation and alternatives, counsel the client about the process and her \nrights, fight for a favorable plea agreement, and, if the case cannot be pled, prepare a \nconstitutionally vigorous defense. \nClass Representative Charles Hammonds \n119.  Named Plaintiff Charles Hammonds is a resident of Westmoreland County. \n120.  Mr. Hammonds was charged with Theft by Deception-False Impression under 18 \nPa. C.S.A. § 3922(a)(1) on July 6, 2011. \n121.  On January 10, 2012, Mr. Hammonds applied for legal assistance through the \nOPD.  Mr. Hammonds was informed that although he qualified for public defender \nrepresentation, the OPD had to deny his application at that time because it lacked the \n33 \n\nnecessary resources to provide him with adequate assistance of counsel as required by law. \nMr. Hammonds is currently without counsel. \n122.  Mr. Hammonds is experiencing ongoing harm as a consequence of the denial of \nhis constitutional right to counsel.  An attorney capable of providing the adequate defense to \nwhich Mr. Hammonds is entitled would inquire into the facts, investigate the allegations, \nincluding the interviewing of witnesses, consider and file necessary pre-trial motions, \nconsider sentencing mitigation and alternatives, counsel the client about the process and his \nrights, fight for a favorable plea agreement, and, if the case cannot be pled, prepare a \nconstitutionally vigorous defense. \n123.  The right to counsel is fundamental to a fair trial.  The indigent criminal \ndefendant has the same right to adequate representation by an active advocate as a defendant \nwho can afford private counsel. This right includes the obligations to confer with the client, \nto thoroughly investigate the relevant facts and the governing law, to compel the attendance \nof witnesses, to advise the accused, and to otherwise strategize and prepare the case for trial. \n124.  The class plaintiffs have been denied adequate assistance of counsel because they \nhave no counsel at all.  Because they cannot afford private counsel and the OPD has been \ndenied the resources to provide constitutionally adequate representation to all eligible adult \nindigent criminal defendants prosecuted in Luzerne County, class plaintiffs are currently \nnavigating the criminal justice system alone, in violation of their constitutional rights. \nCauses of Action \nCount !-Mandamus (by Plaintiffs Individually against all Defendants) \n125.  Paragraphs 1 through 124 are incorporated herein by reference as if pleaded in \nfull. \n34 \n\n126.  This Court has jurisdiction to hear this petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to \nRule I 092(c  )(I) and (2) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. \n127.  \"Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy designed to compel official performance \nof a ministerial act or mandatory duty ....\"   County ofA llegheny v. Commonwealth, 490 \nA.2d 402, 408 (Pa. 1985).  In order to justify the use of this remedy, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate \"a clear legal right to relief, a corresponding duty to act in the defendant, and the \nlack of any other adequate remedy.\" Medico v. Makowski, 793 A.2d 167, 169 (Pa. Commw. \nCt. 2002). \n128.  Plaintiffs have a clear right to relief.  Plaintiff Flora has a statutory and \nconstitutional obligation as the Chief Public Defender to provide adequate counsel to the \nindigent defendants represented by the OPD, and Plaintiffs Volciak, Holman, and Hammond \nhave a constitutional right to representation in their pending criminal proceedings. \n129.  Plaintiff Flora in his capacity as Chief Public Defender of Luzerne County has a \nresponsibility under the Public Defender Act to provide constitutionally competent \nrepresentation to all individuals in Luzerne County who are facing criminal charges and \ncannot afford counsel.  16 P.S. § 9960.6.  Defendants' refusal and failure to provide Plaintiff \nFlora with the necessary funding and resources prevents him from providing representation at \nall critical phases of their cases for all adult indigent defendants in Luzerne County. \nSpecifically, attorneys in the office are frequently: \na.  Unable to interview or meet with clients prior to preliminary hearings; \nb.  Unable to contact their clients between court appearances; \nc.  Unable to conduct significant, if any, investigation or discovery; \nd.  Unable to engage in significant, if any, motion practice; \n35 \n\ne.  Unable to gather adequate information to engage in effective plea negotiations; \nf.  Unable to engage in sufficient trial preparation; and \ng.  Unable to properly litigate appeals because of a lack of appellate experience. \n130.  Since December 19, 2011, Plaintiff Flora has notified over three hundred (300) \nadult indigent defendants in Luzerne County that, even though they are eligible for \nrepresentation, the OPD is unable to provide them with counsel due to a lack of resources. \n131.  Many of these individuals currently remain without representation in violation of \ntheir right to counsel under the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. See Gideon, 372 U.S. \nat 339; U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Pa. Const. art. I,§ 9.  They have not waived their right \nto counsel. \n132.  Class Plaintiffs Samantha Volciak, Yolanda Holman, and Charles Hammonds are \nseveral of the numerous individuals who are currently facing criminal charges in Luzerne \nCounty without counsel in violation of their constitutional rights. \n133.  Defendants have a duty to act.  The Public Defender Act commands counties to \nprovide indigent defense through a public defender as required by the U.S. and Pennsylvania \nConstitutions.  16 P.S. § 9960.3. \n134.  Defendants' legal obligation to fund a constitutionally adequate indigent defense \nsystem for Luzerne County may be fulfilled in ways other than through the OPD.  For \ninstance, the County could appropriate money to hire private attorneys on a contractual basis \nto supplement the OPD's services.  Defendants have, however, failed to provide adequate \nresources to fund the OPD or any alternate system to represent indigent criminal defendants. \n135.  Pennsylvania courts have repeatedly stated that mandamus may be used to compel \nstate and local goverrunents to provide the necessary resources for goverrunent officials to \n36 \n\nperform their duties to constitutional and statutory standards.  Medico, 793 A.2d at 171; PA   \nState Ass 'n ofC  ounty Comm 'rs v. Commonwealth, 681 A.2d 699, 702-03 (Pa. 1996); County \nofA llegheny, 490 A.2d at 406; Leahey v. Farrel/66 A.2d 577, 579-80 (Pa. 1949); Kistler v. \nCarbon County, 35 A.2d 733, 735 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1944). \n136.  Defendants have repeatedly denied Plaintiff Flora's requests for additional \nfunding and have thus been deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. \n137.  Defendants have also refused to fill funded vacancies in the Adult Unit of the \nPublic Defender's Office, further devastating the OPD's resources and ability to comply with \nstatutory and constitutional mandates. \n138.  Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law or equity that can protect their \nrights and interests. \n139.  Plaintiff Flora has no other adequate remedy available to him to secure the \nresources needed to perform his statutory and constitutional duties as Defendants have \nrefused to provide Plaintiff Flora with sufficient funding. \n140.  Plaintiffs Volciak, Holman, and Hammonds have no other adequate remedy \navailable to them to rectify the deprivation of their constitutional right to counsel in criminal \nproceedings. \n141.  As Defendants have refused to meet their statutory and constitutional obligation \nto provide Plaintiff Flora with the necessary funds to fulfill his constitutional and statutory \nduties and have thereby denied Class Plaintiffs Volciak, Holman, and Hammonds their \nconstitutional right to counsel, mandamus is the appropriate remedy under Pennsylvania law \nto compel Defendants to provide the requisite funds for Plaintiff Flora to fulfill his \nI \n37 \n\nI \nf \nl \nconstitutional and statutory responsibilities and restore Plaintiffs' constitutional right to \nI \ncounsel. \nCount II- United States Constitution, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and 42 \nUS. C.  § 1983 (by Class Plaintiffs against all Defendants) \n142.  Paragraphs 1 through 141 are incorporated herein by reference as if pleaded in \nfull. \n143.  Defendants' failure to provide adequate resources for indigent defense in Luzerne \nCounty violates Class Plaintiffs' right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution to counsel in a criminal prosecution. \n144.  At all times relevant herein, Defendant Lawton acted under color of state law in \nhis official capacity as the Luzerne County Manager. \n145.  Class Plaintiffs' requests for counsel in their criminal proceedings were denied \nbecause the OPD lacks sufficient funding and resources to represent competently all eligible \nindigent criminal defendants prosecuted in Luzerne County. \n146.  The right to counsel is clearly established under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Gideon, 372 U.S. at \n339.  The right attaches at \"a criminal defendant's initial appearance before a judicial officer, \ni \nI \nwhere he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction ....\"  \nRothgery, 554 U.S. at 213. \n14 7.  Class Plaintiffs have appeared before judicial officers without counsel when they \nwere constitutionally entitled to representation.  Class Plaintiffs have not waived their right to \ncounsel.  Because Class Plaintiffs have not waived their right to counsel but have been \nI \ncompelled to appear before judicial officers without representation, their Sixth and \nI \nFourteenth Amendment right to counsel has been violated. \n! \n38  i \n\n148.  Defendants are directly responsible for the violation of Class Plaintiffs' Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendment right to counsel. \n149.  Defendants have refused to provide the OPD with the necessary funding and \nresources to supply counsel, who have the time and resources to provide adequate \nrepresentation and prepare a proper defense, to all eligible indigent criminal defendants \nprosecuted in Luzerne County.  Defendants have also refused to permit Plaintiff Flora to fill \nfour (4) funded vacancies within the OPD due to a County-instituted hiring freeze or to \nappropriate monies necessary to hire additional staff sufficient to enable the OPD to provide \nservices that satisfy Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment requirements. \n150.  Defendants have a duty under the Public Defender Act to provide the OPD with \nthe necessary funding and resources to fulfill its constitutional and statutory duties.  16 P.S. \n§§ 9960.3, 9960.5(a), 9960.7, 9960.9. \n151.  Defendants' legal obligation to fund a constitutionally adequate indigent defense \nsystem for Luzerne County may be fulfilled in ways other than through the OPD.  For \ninstance, the County could appropriate money to hire private attorneys on a contractual basis \nto supplement the OPD's services.  Defendants have, however, failed to provide adequate \nresources to fund the OPD or any alternate system to represent indigent criminal defendants. \n152.  Therefore, Defendants have caused the violation of Class Plaintiffs' Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendment right to counsel, by failing to provide the necessary funding and \nresources to serve indigent criminal defendants in Luzerne County, be it through the OPD or \nsome alternate system of assigning competent counsel. \nCount III- Pennsylvania Constitution. Art. I, § 9 (by Class Plaintiffs against all \nDefendants) \n39 \n\n153.  Paragraphs 1 through 152 are incorporated herein by reference as if pleaded in \nfull. \n154.  Defendants' failure to provide adequate resources for indigent defense violates \nClass Plaintiffs' right under Article I, § 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution to counsel in \ncriminal prosecutions. \n155.  Class Plaintiffs' requests for counsel in their criminal proceedings were denied \nbecause the OPD lacks sufficient funding and resources to represent all eligible indigent \ncriminal defendants prosecuted in Luzerne County. \n156.  The right to counsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution attaches at the same \ntime as the right to counsel provided by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n157.  Class Plaintiffs have appeared before judicial officers without counsel when they \nwere entitled to representation under the Pennsylvania Constitution.  Class Plaintiffs have not \nwaived their right to counsel.  Because Class Plaintiffs have not waived their right to counsel \nbut have been compelled to appear before judicial officers without representation, their right \nto counsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution has been violated. \n158.  Defendants are directly responsible for the violation of Class Plaintiffs' right to \ncounsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution. \n159.  Defendants have refused to provide the OPD with the necessary funding and \nresources to supply counsel to all eligible indigent criminal defendants prosecuted in Luzerne \nCounty.  Defendants have also refused to permit Plaintiff Flora to fill four ( 4) funded \nvacancies within the Office due to a County-instituted hiring freeze or to appropriate monies \n40 \n\nnecessary to hire additional staff sufficient to enable the Public Defender to provide services \nthat satisfy constitutional requirements. \n160.  Defendants have a duty under the Public Defender Act to provide the OPD with \nthe necessary funding and resources to fulfill its constitutional and statutory duties.  16 P .S. \n§§ 9960.3, 9960.5(a), 9960.7, 9960.9. \n161.  Defendants' legal obligation to fund a constitutionally adequate indigent defense \nsystem for Luzerne County may be fulfilled in ways other than through the OPD.  For \ninstance, the County could appropriate money to hire private attorneys on a contractual basis \nto supplement the OPD's services. Defendants have, however, failed to provide adequate \nresources to fund the OPD or any alternate system to represent indigent criminal defendants. \n162.  Therefore, defendants have caused the violation of Class Plaintiffs' right to \ncounsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution, by failing to provide the necessary funding and \nresources to serve indigent criminal defendants in Luzerne County, be it through the OPD or \nsome alternate system of assigning competent counsel. \nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \n1.  An order requiring Defendants to promptly appoint private or conflict counsel when \nthe OPD declines representation of any adult defendant due to excessive workloads or \nlack of resources; \n2.  An order requiring Defendants to lift the hiring freeze and authorize Plaintiff Flora to \nfill the four (4) funded vacancies in the OPD; \n3.  An order allowing Plaintiff Flora to continue the December 19, 2011 policy until such \ntime as the OPD has adequate resources to represent all indigent adult criminal \ndefendants prosecuted in Luzerne County; \n41 \n\n4.  An order requiring Defendants to authorize PlaintiffFlora to hire two (2) attorneys to \nhandle appellate cases and one (1) secretary to help with office administration; \n5.  A peremptory judgment under Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1098 compelling \nDefendants to provide necessary funding to allow the OPD to hire additional trial \nattorneys and support staff as well as upgrade the physical and technological \nresources such that the OPD is capable of providing representation to all qualified \nindigent defendants prosecuted in Luzerne County that satisfies standards set by the \nU.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions; \n6.  Attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; \nIt   \n7.

Commonwealth, 623 Pa. 564, 83 A.3d 901, 917 (2013) (quoting Thierfelder v. Wolfert, 617 Pa. 295, 52 A.3d \n1251, 1253 (2012)). “We will affirm an order sustaining preliminary objections only if it is clear that the party filing the petition \nfor review is not entitled to relief as a matter of law.” Id. (citation omitted). Thus, the factual and procedural history of this case is \nderived from the amended complaint. For purposes of this appeal, we accept, as we must, these histories as true. \n \n2  See  Stephanie  Chen,  “Pennsylvania  rocked  by  jailing  kids  for  cash  scandal”,  CNN, \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/23/pennsylvania.corrupt.judges/ (Feb. 24, 2009) (last visited on June 6, 2016). \n \n \n3  Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be \nheard by himself and his counsel ....” Pa. Const., Art. I, § 9. \n \n \n4  We did not grant review of Appellants’ claim that the Commonwealth Court incorrectly held that Flora lacked standing. \nAccordingly, Flora no longer is a party to this case. The caption has been adjusted to reflect this change. \n \n \n5  Before us, Appellees no longer argue, as they have consistently throughout these proceedings, that Appellants lack standing to \npursue relief. \n \n \n6  We do not provide a separate discussion of the right to counsel enshrined in Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. \n  28 \n \n\nKuren v. Luzerne County, 637 Pa. 33 (2016)   \n146 A.3d 715 \n \n  It is now well-settled that the right to counsel recognized in Article I, Section 9 and in the Sixth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution are jurisprudentially coextensive. See Commonwealth v. Wholaver, 605 Pa. 325, 989 A.2d 883, 897 (2010). \n \n7  The Court of Appeals also addressed a litany of other legal issues that are immaterial to our discussion. \n \n \n8  After the Court of Appeals ruled in Duncan, the case proceeded along a complicated and presumably uncommon procedural \ntrajectory that ultimately resulted in the Michigan Supreme Court affirming the Court of Appeals. Initially, on April 30, 2010, the \n \nMichigan Supreme Court, after oral argument, affirmed the Court of Appeals in a per curiam order. See Duncan v. State, 486 \nMich. 906, 780 N.E.2d 843 (2010). Then, on July 16, 2010, the Michigan Supreme Court granted the State’s motion for \nreconsideration, vacated the April 30, 2010 order, and reversed the Michigan Court of Appeals in another per curiam order. See \nDuncan v. State, 486 Mich. 1071, 784 N.W.2d 51 (2010). In that order, the Michigan Supreme Court noted briefly that the \nreversal was based upon the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion from the Court of Appeals. Id. Finally, on December 22, \n2010, the Michigan Supreme Court granted the class’ motion for reconsideration of the July 16, 2010 order. The Court again \nreversed itself, and reinstated the April 30, 2010 order affirming the Court of Appeals. See Duncan v. State, 488 Mich. 957, 866 \nN.W.2d 407 (2010). \n \n9  In 2009, when Justice Denied was published, Utah also required counties exclusively to fund public defender’s offices. On March \n22, 2016, Utah’s governor signed into law a bill that, inter alia, established a commission to review the adequacy of indigent \n \nrepresentation and appropriated state funds to provide grants to Utah counties who shoulder the financial cost of providing \ncounsel to indigent defendants. See Utah Code §§ 77–32–801-810 (effective May 10, 2016). \n \n1  I also highlight that Appellants’ complaint seeks a permanent, not a preliminary, injunction. This Court has explained that, in \nPennsylvania, a court may issue a permanent injunction if the party seeking it can establish a clear right to relief. Bd. of Revision \n \nof Taxes, City of Philadelphia v. City of Philadelphia, 607 Pa. 104, 4 A.3d 610, 627 (2010). The Court further has explained that a \nparty seeking a permanent injunction is not required to prove either irreparable harm or the need for immediate relief, “as is \nnecessary when seeking a preliminary injunction[.]” Id. \nThe Majority concludes that, in order for Appellants to establish their right to injunctive relief, they must demonstrate “the \nlikelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury[.]” Majority Opinion at –––– – –––– (quoting O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 \nU.S. 488, 502, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974)). In terms of Pennsylvania law, it seems that such a requirement is more akin \nto the standard for a preliminary injunction than it is to the standard for a permanent injunction. \n \n2  16 P.S. §§ 9960.1-9960.13. \n \n \n3  As detailed by the Majority Opinion, Appellees argue that the Post Conviction Relief Act, (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546, \nprovides a remedy for successful claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. This is true. However, the PCRA does not offer a \n \nvehicle to bring the specific cause of action that Appellants present in this matter nor does it contain a remedy that would allow \nfor the relief that Appellants seek. Consequently, the PCRA does not supply Appellants with an adequate or appropriate remedy \nat law. \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n  29 \n ",

Plaintiff Al Flora, Jr.  (\"Plaintiff Flora\") commenced this action by Verified \nComplaint on April 10, 2012, alleging: (1) that he is the Chief Public Defender \nfor Luzerne County; (2) that Defendants had threatened to fire him because of \nhis First Amendment protected activity; and (3) that Defendants' plans to \ndischarge him would violate the public policy of Pennsylvania and constitute \nwrongful discharge. \n2.  Also on April 10, 2012, Plaintiff Flora filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nseeking to enjoin Defendants from taking adverse action against him. \n3.

The voters of Luzerne County (the \"County\") in 2009 approved a \nchanged in the structure of County government; \nb.  Pursuant to such a referendum, the County was required to transition to a \nHome Rule Charter; \nc.  Pursuant to such a transition, a Home Rule Transition Committee was put \nin place to handle the administration of the conversion to the new \ngovernment structure under the Home Rule Charter; \nd.  The Home Rule Transition Committee notified current holders of \nappointed offices that their previous appointments to office would expire \nby virtue of the adoption of the Home Rule Charter and that the County \nintended to advertise such positions and fill them in accordance with the \nprocess( es) set forth in the new charter; \ne.  Pursuant to such transition, the Home Rule Transition Committee \nprepared a job description for the  position of County Public Defender, \nalso known as Chief Public Defender, and posted such description on the \nCounty website in October 2011 in conjunction with the solicitation of \napplications for such position; \n2 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 14    Filed 04/19/12   Page 3 of 6\nf.  The Home Rule Transition Committee sent a written notice to Plaintiff \nAl Flora, Jr.  (\"Plaintiff Flora\") of such intention and invited him to apply \nfor re-appointment; \ng.  On October 20,2011, Plaintiff Flora submitted a letter of interest in \nobtaining appointment to the position of Chief Public Defender under the \nnew charter; \nh.  The Home Rule Transition Committee continued to solicit and to receive \napplications for the position of Chief Public Defender through mid \nDecember 2011 ; \n1.  The Home Rule Transition Committee has referred the application for the \nposition of Chief Public Defender to the County Manager; \nJ.  The County Manager, Defendant Robert Lawton, did not assume his \nduties until February 24,2012; \nk.  The County Manager has the authority under section 4.0SA of the Home \nRule Charter to recommend candidates as heads of Executive \nDepartments to the County Council for confirmation to a permanent \nappointment, including the position of Chief Pub lic Defender; \n1.

The County Manager has the authority under section 4.08C of the Home \nRule Charter to make an interim appointment to the position of Chief \nPublic Defender, which appointment is effective for ninety (90) days; \nn.  The County Manager has yet to exercise the authority to make an interim \nappointment and Plaintiff Flora remains under consideration for both an \ninterim appointment and for recommendation for confirmation to County \nCouncil; \no.  Until such time as the County Manager exercises his authority either to \nmake a recommendation to County Councilor to make an interim \nappointment, Plaintiff Flora continues to act as Chief Public Defender; \np.  The County initiated a hiring process for the office of Chief Public \nDefender prior to and independent of any comments and/or criticisms of \nPlaintiff Flora relating to the funding and/or operations of the Office of \nPublic Defender. \nq.  The County is entitled to pursue the hiring process for the position of \nChief Public Defender previously initiated, and the County Manager may \nmake an interim appointment in accordance with the provisions of the \n4 \n\nCase 3:12-cv-00665-ARC   Document 14    Filed 04/19/12   Page 5 of 6\nHome Rule Charter or a recommendation to the County Council for a \npermanent appointment. \n5.  It is further stipulated that Plaintiff Flora shall remain in his current capacity \nuntil such action by the County Manager. \n6.  It is further stipulated that Plaintiff Flora will not be subjected to any adverse \nemployment action in retaliation for First Amendment protected activity. \n7.

These missions recognize that the \nright to counsel at each critical stage of the adversary process, not just at trial, is \nfundamental to the administration of justice and fairness in the Commonwealth.  For \nthese reasons, and to secure the integrity of the criminal justice system, amici urge this \nCourt to reverse the Commonwealth Court’s ruling barring Appellants Kuren’s and \nAllabaugh’s claims for prospective relief.   \nIndeed, it is the fundamental professional duty of all attorneys to ensure that the \nright to counsel is fully protected: \nA lawyer is . . . an officer of the legal system and a public \ncitizen having special responsibility for the quality of \njustice . . . .  A lawyer should be mindful of the deficiencies \nin the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, \nand sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford \nadequate  legal  assistance,  and  should  therefore  devote \nprofessional time and civic influence in their behalf.  A \nlawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these \nobjectives . . . . \n \n\n \nModel Rules of Professional Conduct Preamble: A Lawyer’s Responsibilities \n(emphasis added).1  Amici provide further information about each of their \norganizations’ missions below. \nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  \nCRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS \nThe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (“NACDL”) is a not-\nfor-profit professional organization that represents the nation’s criminal defense \nattorneys.  NACDL is the preeminent organization advancing the institutional mission \nof the nation’s criminal defense bar to ensure to proper and fair administration of \njustice, and justice and due process for all persons accused of crime.  Founded in \n1958, NACDL has a membership of thousands of direct members (including nearly \n350 in Pennsylvania) and an additional 40,000 affiliate members in all fifty states and \ntwenty-eight nations.  Its members include private criminal defense lawyers, public \ndefenders,  military  defense  counsel,  law  professors,  and  judges  committed  to \npreserving fairness and promoting a rational and humane criminal justice system.  The \nAmerican Bar Association recognizes NACDL as an affiliate organization and accords \nit representation in the House of Delegates.   \n                                                                                              \n1 See also ABA Criminal Justice Section Standards: Defense Section, Standard 4-1-\n2(d) (“Defense counsel should seek to reform and improve the administration of \ncriminal justice.  When inadequacies or injustices in the substantive or procedural law \ncome to defense counsel’s attention, he or she should stimulate efforts for remedial \naction.”). \n2 \n\n \nIn furtherance of its mission to safeguard the rights of the accused and to \nchampion fundamental constitutional rights, NACDL frequently appears as amicus \ncuriae before the United States Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeal, and the \nhighest courts of numerous states.  In recent years, NACDL’s briefs have been cited \non numerous occasions by the Supreme Court in some of its most important criminal \nlaw decisions.  See, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008); Rothgery v. \nGillespie Cnty., 554 U.S. 191 (2008); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).  \nNACDL also filed amicus briefs in landmark state cases involving indigent defense \nissues, including in New York in Hurrell-Harring v. New York, 930 N.E.2d 217 (N.Y. \n2010), and in Maryland in DeWolfe v. Richmond, 76 A.3d 962 (Md. 2012).  NACDL \nhas a specific and demonstrated interest in ensuring that accused persons have access \nto qualified counsel at every stage of a criminal proceeding.  NACDL recently \nsupported this principle in Rothgery v. Gillespie County, where NACDL successfully \nurged the Supreme Court to find that the right to counsel unequivocally attaches at \narraignment, the first formal proceeding at which an individual is accused.   \nNACDL, informed by the experience of its membership, is uniquely well \npositioned to inform this Court of the consequences that are visited upon criminal \ndefendants when they are subjected to representation by overburdened and under-\nresourced counsel, and to explain why post-conviction remedies are inadequate to \nredress this deficiency.   \n3 \n\n \nFurthermore, NACDL commits significant resources to ensuring that indigent \naccused persons have access to meaningful and effective representation.  NACDL \nmaintains a full-time Indigent Defense Counsel whose sole responsibility is to support \nindigent defense reform efforts throughout the country.  Pursuant to a grant from the \nJustice Department’s Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”), NACDL along with the \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants \n(“SCLAID”), serving as a consultant, is currently involved in two workload studies \nwith the goal of improving excessive workloads through the use of evidence-based \ndata  to  make  public  defender  organizations  more  efficient,  reliable,  and  most \nimportantly, capable of providing effective assistance of counsel. \nThe Association is currently pursuing training and reform initiatives in at least \nhalf a dozen states.  In addition, NACDL devotes considerable resources to providing \nback-up support to both public defenders and private counsel who handle assigned \ncases, and funds a full time Resource Counsel to perform that function.  NACDL also \nsponsors scholarships to provide access to training programs for those engaged in \npublic defense.  The Association recognizes that a system of criminal justice that \nprovides inferior justice to those whose poverty prevents them from hiring private \ncounsel  is  inconsistent  with  fundamental  American  values,  including,  most \nsignificantly,  the  right  to  counsel  as  guaranteed  by  the  Sixth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments and the constitutions of the states.   \n4 \n\n \nNACDL has long conducted and sponsored pioneering investigations, research, \nand reporting on indigent defense issues.  In recent years, NACDL has published \ngroundbreaking reports chronicling the deficiencies in indigent defense, including: \nThree Minute Justice: Haste and Waste in Florida’s Misdemeanor Courts; Minor \nCrimes, Massive Waste: The Terrible Toll of America’s Broken Misdemeanor Courts; \nCriminal Justice in the 21st Century: Eliminating Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the \nCriminal  Justice  System;  National  Indigent  Defense  Reform:  The  Solution  Is \nMultifaceted; Gideon at 50 Part I – Rationing Justice: The Underfunding of Assigned \nCounsel Systems; and Gideon at 50  Part II  – Redefining Indigence: Financial \nEligibility Guidelines for Assigned Counsel.2 \nAccordingly,  NACDL  brings  a  perspective  that  can  inform  the  Court’s \nconsideration of the issues in this case and has a direct interest in seeing that the \nindigent accused have a vehicle to redress systemically deficient representation. \nPENNSYLVANIA ASSOCIATION OF  \nCRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS \nThe Pennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (“PACDL”) is a \nprofessional association of attorneys admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of \nPennsylvania  and  who  are  actively  engaged  in  providing  criminal  defense \nrepresentation.  Founded in 1988, PACDL is the recognized affiliate of NACDL in \n                                                                                              \n2 For copies of these and other NACDL reports, visit www.nacdl.org/reports. \n5 \n\n \nPennsylvania.  As amicus curiae, PACDL presents the perspective of experienced \ncriminal defense attorneys who aim to protect and ensure by rule of law those \nindividual rights guaranteed by the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions, and \nwho work to achieve justice and dignity for defendants.  PACDL’s membership \nincludes more than 850 private criminal defense practitioners and public defenders \nthroughout the Commonwealth.   \nPACDL members have a direct interest in the outcome of this appeal because of \ntheir concerns for ensuring that criminal defendants’ constitutional rights are not \nabridged and that established precedent protecting those rights is given all due \nconsideration.  PACDL cooperates closely with the Pennsylvania Public Defender \nAssociation, including coordination of the two associations’ annual meetings and \neducational programs.  Like the members of NACDL, the members of PACDL have \nsignificant experience representing those accused of serious crimes and are aware of \nthe consequences to criminal defendants who are represented by overburdened and \nunder-resourced counsel.  Accordingly, PACDL is in a position to inform the Court’s \nconsideration of the issues in this case, including why post-conviction remedies and \ncase-by-case adjudication are inadequate to redress the systemic problems affecting \nthose accused of serious crimes in Luzerne County. \n6 \n\n \nINCORPORATION OF OPENING SECTIONS OF BRIEF \nThe NACDL and PACDL (collectively, the “amici”) incorporate Appellants \nKuren’s and Allabaugh’s Statement of Jurisdiction, Order in Question, Statement of \nScope and Standard of Review, Statement of Questions Involved, and Statement of the \nCase. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe  Commonwealth  Court’s  decision  should  be  reversed.    The  decision \nincorrectly  holds—against  the  weight  of  developing  authority—that  only  post-\nconviction remedies are available to address the systematic denial of fundamental \nconstitutional rights to those accused of serious crimes.  This Court should reverse the \nCommonwealth’s Court’s erroneous ruling because the post-conviction legal remedy \navailable to enforce Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), is wholly \ninadequate to redress harms suffered by those accused of crimes—both serious and \nless so—who cannot obtain effective assistance of counsel prior to conviction, let \nalone prior to trial.  The occasional failings of particular lawyers in particular cases do \nnot define the crisis in indigent defense more than fifty years after Gideon.  The \nproblems are systemic and demand systemic solutions.  Where a public defender’s \noffice cannot provide even minimally effective representation in most of its cases \nbecause of onerously excessive caseloads and a crippling lack of resources—the \nprecise situation in Luzerne County alleged in the Amended Complaint—prospective \n7 \n\n \nrelief is the only way to prevent the accused, as a class and not merely as individuals, \nfrom suffering irremediable harm at critical stages of the adversary criminal justice \nprocess prior to trial.   \nARGUMENT \nIn  affirming  the  trial  court’s  dismissal  of  the  Amended  Complaint,  the \nCommonwealth Court refused to recognize a constructive denial of counsel claim, \nruling that the only remedy available to those who receive deficient representation is a \npost-conviction claim under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  (See Oct. \n14, 2014 Opinion (“Op.”) at 18.)  In doing so, the Commonwealth Court went against \nthe  weight  of  developing  authority  on  a  matter  of  first  impression implicating \nsubstantial public interests in the fair administration of justice.  Worse, the effect of \nthe Commonwealth Court’s ruling denies any avenue of prospective relief to those \nwhose constitutional right to counsel—guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the \nUnited  States  Constitution  and  Article  1,  Section  9  of  the  Constitution  of  the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania—is directly threatened as a consequence of the \ngovernment’s systemic shortcomings in funding and staffing a public defender’s \noffice.  Because case-by-case post-conviction relief is wholly inadequate to redress the \nvarious injuries that an accused may suffer from the systematic denial of adequate \nindigent defense services throughout our Commonwealth (and, indeed, our nation), \nthe Court should recognize the necessity of permitting litigants to invoke the courts’ \n8 \n\n \nequitable powers to issue prospective relief where nearly all of the poor who are \naccused of crimes have access to legal assistance only through a system that is \nstructurally incapable of ensuring their constitutional rights.   \nI.  APPELLANTS  HAVE  STATED  A  CLAIM  FOR  CONSTRUCTIVE \nDENIAL OF COUNSEL BECAUSE THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE \nAMENDED  COMPLAINT  DEMONSTRATE  THAT  THERE  ARE \nSYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES IN THE LUZERNE COUNTY OFFICE OF \nTHE  PUBLIC  DEFENDER  THAT  CREATE  AN  IMMINENT  AND \nUNACCEPTABLE RISK THAT APPELLANTS’ RIGHT TO COUNSEL \nWILL BE VIOLATED IN WAYS THAT CANNOT BE CURED BY \nPOST-CONVICTION REVIEW \nThe deficiencies in the Luzerne County Office of the Public Defender (“OPD”) \ndescribed in the Amended Complaint constitute violations of Appellants Kuran’s and \nAllabaugh’s right to counsel under the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions.  \nThe injuries with which they are imminently threatened cannot be remedied by post-\nconviction review pursuant to Strickland.  In light of the imminent threat and the \nirreparable nature of the constitutional injuries they and others may suffer as a \nconsequence of the systemic problems at the OPD, Kuran and Allabaugh should be \npermitted to proceed with a claim for prospective relief to protect their right to \ncounsel. \nA.  The Amended Complaint Describes Systemic Violations of Kuran’s \nand Allabaugh’s Right to Counsel Under the United States and \nPennsylvania Constitutions \nThe  Amended  Complaint  alleges  that  the  OPD  is  subject  to  routine \nunderfunding from Luzerne County that prevents it from fulfilling the government’s \n9 \n\n \nobligation to provide constitutionally adequate representation to all of its clients.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23, 28.)  Among other things, the lack of funding causes the OPD to \nsuffer from caseloads for its attorneys that far exceed national maximum caseload \nstandards,  a  lack  of  adequate  clerical  staff,  a  lack  of  adequate  computers  and \ninformation technology, and inadequate physical facilities that are overcrowded and \nnot suitable for client conferences or maintaining client confidentiality.  (See id. ¶ 29.) \nThese deficiencies have significant deleterious effects on the OPD, which is \nunable to engage in many of the most basic functions of representation in any \nmeaningful way.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 45.)  For example, the seriously overburdened \nattorneys in the OPD are prevented from meeting and conferring with clients in any \nmeaningful way prior to critical stages in their legal proceedings, prevented from \nconducting reviews of client files, prevented from conducting discovery or engaging \nin motion practice, prevented from conducting factual investigations, and prevented \nfrom conducting necessary preparation for hearings, trials, and appeals.  (See id.)  \nThus, because of the systemic deficiencies affecting it, the OPD is incapable of \nproviding even minimally adequate representation to the majority of its indigent \ndefendant clients. \nThis inability on the part of the OPD to meet the state’s obligations to provide \neffective assistance of counsel is not merely speculative.  The OPD is incapable of \nmeeting the fundamental requirements of adequate legal representation as defined by \n10 \n\n \nnational standards, the Rules of Professional Responsibility, and as required by the \nSixth Amendment and Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.  The \nsystemic problems affecting the OPD prevent its attorneys from satisfying basic \nstandards such as having knowledge of the relevant areas of the law, being present at \nevery critical stage of their clients’ proceedings, conducting reasonable factual and \nlegal investigations into the charges against their clients, and consulting with their \nclients to discover relevant information about the case to permit them to inform clients \nof their rights and enable their clients to make informed decisions about their defense.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 48-70.) \nThe Amended Complaint further establishes that OPD attorneys are tasked with \nworkloads  that  far exceed the  maximum  caseload standards established  by  the \nAmerican Bar Association.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 75-84.)  And beyond that, the OPD lacks \nsupport staff, having no social workers, paralegals, or trial assistants to help attorneys \nprepare cases or manage workload.  (See id. ¶ 85.)  These crippling effects of these \ninstitutional deficiencies and excessive caseloads are clear and prevent OPD from \nmeeting recognized standards for adequate representation, such as those set forth in \nthe National Legal Aid & Defender Association Performance Guidelines.  (See id. \n¶¶ 92, 93.) \nThe problems facing the OPD fall within a larger pattern of problems facing \nrepresentation of indigent defendants in this Commonwealth and throughout our \n11 \n\n \nnation.  Numerous studies have shown that overworked and under-resourced public \ndefenders are powerless to overcome the structural problems that impair defense \nattorneys’ ability to render effective assistance to their indigent clients.  By way of \nexample, the Pennsylvania Task Force and Advisory Committee on Services to \nIndigent Criminal Defendants3 issued a report in 2011 that noted that many public \ndefender  offices  “across  Pennsylvania  have  caseloads  high  enough  that  even \nexperienced defense lawyers would have difficulty in providing an adequate and \nethically compliant defense for all clients. . . . These staggering caseloads create \nnumerous difficulties for counsel, which can lead to inadequate representation of some \nclients.”  A Constitutional Default: Services to Indigent Criminal Defendants in \nPennsylvania (December 2011) (the “Task Force Report”)4 at 74.  Among the \nproblems that excessive caseloads cause, the report identified poor attorney-client \ncontact, with attorneys unable “to meet personally with their clients to receive and \ncommunicate vital information.”  Id.  In addition, the report observed that excessive \ncaseloads lead to “[i]nadequate preparation, as attorneys . . . fail to conduct interviews \nor investigations, file no motions or file the same boilerplate motions in every case, \nfail to act in a timely manner on important information, fail to pursue issues, or ‘cut \n                                                                                              \n3 The Task Force operated under the Pennsylvania General Assembly’s Joint State \nGovernment Commission. \n4  A  copy  of  the  Task  Force  Report  is  available  on  the  Internet  at \nhttp://jsg.legis.state.pa.us/resources/documents/ftp/publications/2011-265-\nIndigent%20Defense.pdf (last visited September 8, 2015). \n12 \n\n \ncorners’ in their work.”  Id.  The report identified Luzerne County as one in which the \nnumber  of  public  defense  attorneys  was  insufficient  to  provide  adequate \nrepresentation.  See id. at 75-76.   \nThe Task Force’s observations are not a statement about the quality of the \nlawyers providing services to indigent defendants:  \nThe problem is not the public defenders (PDs) themselves, \nbut the system in which they work.  Most PDs are hard-\nworking, committed, and competent professionals.  The \nproblem is that they must work against daunting obstacles: \ninadequate  training  and  oversight,  severely  limited \nresources,  and  unmanageable  caseloads.    In  many  of \nPennsylvania’s  counties,  the  most  brilliant  and \naccomplished  lawyer  could  not  provide  adequate \nrepresentation because he or she simply would not have \nthe time and resources needed to mount a constitutionally \nadequate defense. \nId. at 3 (emphasis added).   \nBecause  their  assigned  counsel  labor  under  these  untenable  conditions, \nAppellants Kuren and Allabaugh have stated a claim that they (like thousands of \nothers in similar circumstances) have suffered—and that they are at imminent risk of \ncontinuing to suffer—a violation of their right to counsel under the United States and \nPennsylvania constitutions.  Indeed, as Appellants Kuren and Allabaugh detail in their \nmerits  brief,  the  right  to  counsel  under  the  United  States  and  Pennsylvania \nconstitutions promises meaningful and effective assistance of counsel at all critical \nstages of a criminal prosecution.  This right secures the accused not only against \n13 \n\n \nwrongful convictions resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel at trial but also \nagainst other injuries they may suffer whether or not ultimately convicted or even \ntried, such as by the wrongful denial of bail, excessive sentencing, or the failure to \nnegotiate a proper and favorable plea agreement.   \nThe Commonwealth Court ignored the fact that serious constitutional injuries \ncan and do occur prior to trial as a consequence of the government’s failure to meet its \nobligation to provide indigent defendants with adequate assistance of legal counsel at \nall critical stages of a criminal prosecution.  Instead, the Commonwealth Court \nfocused solely on one purpose of the Sixth Amendment: the purpose to “ensure that \ncriminal defendants receive a fair trial.”  (Op. at 17 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at \n689)).  In focusing on this pronouncement in Strickland, the Commonwealth Court \nignored significant developments in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, including the \nSupreme Court’s affirmation that the Sixth Amendment’s requirement of counsel \napplies not only at trial but at all critical stages of the adversarial process.  See \nRothgery v. Gillespie Cnty., 554 U.S. 191, 208-09 (2008) (rejecting government’s \nargument that “prejudice to a defendant’s pretrial liberty” is not a cognizable harm \nunder the Sixth Amendment).   \nContrary to the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that any prejudice must be \nestablished via a post-conviction Strickland claim, the Supreme Court has recognized \nineffective assistance claims where there never was a trial.  In Rothgery, for example, \n14 \n\n \nthe Court considered a claim brought based on a defendant’s pre-trial incarceration in \na matter in which the charges were eventually dismissed.  554 U.S. at 196-97.  There \nis abundant Supreme Court authority holding that the right to effective assistance of \ncounsel is critical well before trial.  See Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 9 (1970) \n(plurality); see also, e.g., Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 470-71 (1981); United States \nv. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 236-37 (1967); White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 60 (1963).  \nTo  suggest  that  the  Sixth  Amendment  cannot  be  enforced  except  where \ndeficient representation led to a wrongful conviction both contravenes this established \nbody of precedent and demonstrates a misconception of the role of defense counsel in \nthe adversarial criminal justice system.  It also underestimates the power of the courts \nto ensure that rights are not systematically violated in addition to their important role \nin affording individualized remedies after a violation has occurred.  Those charged \nwith serious crimes rely on the effective assistance of counsel to protect their rights \nand interest in various ways at every stage of criminal proceedings and to permit them \nto make informed decisions about their defense.  While the constitutional guarantees \nof assistance of counsel do not guarantee the services of the very best counsel or \nperfect outcomes in every case, there is an indisputable requirement that appointed \ncounsel have the ability, at the very minimum, to be effective and available to \ndefendants at every critical stage of the process.   \n15 \n\n \nConcluding that criminal defendants’ rights are violated only if ineffective \ncounsel ultimately contributes to a wrongful conviction misses the point of assistance \nof counsel at every critical stage of the adversary criminal process.  An approach such \nas that countenanced by the Commonwealth Court eliminates judicial review of a \ngreat deal of the critical role that lawyers play in ensuring that defendants are fairly \ntreated in criminal proceedings and leaves no avenue for indigent defendants to \nprotect their rights prior to conviction.  \nB.  Violations of the Right to Effective Assistance of Counsel at Critical \nStages  of  the  Adversarial  Process  Prior  to  Trial  Cannot  Be \nRemedied  by  Post-Conviction  Review,  Making  Prospective \nInjunctive Relief Appropriate \nThe Commonwealth Court has incorrectly concluded that that the massive \ninstitutional workload and resources crisis at the OPD, which prevents OPD staff from \nrendering services that meet even the minimal requirements of effective assistance to \nthe majority of OPD clients, does not impair staff to the extent that all of its clients are \nin imminent jeopardy of having their rights irremediably violated.   \nThe post-conviction review contemplated by the Commonwealth Court as the \nsole avenue of addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims cannot remedy the \ninjuries that Appellants Kuren and Allabaugh contend they have suffered and will \ncontinue to suffer based on Luzerne County’s inadequate funding of OPD and the \nresulting caseload and resources crisis at OPD, and which innumerable others in \nsimilar circumstances have suffered and will continue to suffer  throughout this \n16 \n\n \nCommonwealth and in much of our nation.  See NACDL, Gideon at 50 Part I – \nRationing Justice: The Underfunding of Assigned Counsel Systems (2013).5  Among \nthose harms are that the OPD is unable to provide adequate assistance of counsel, \nincluding inability of counsel to confer with clients in any adequate or meaningful \nway prior to hearings, or for counsel to gather information, conduct investigation, or \npursue discovery necessary to prepare for or to have adequate plea negotiations.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 96, 106.)   \nAmong  the  potential  harms  post-conviction  review  cannot  remedy  are \nprolonged pre-trial delay or pre-trial detention, the denial of bail or bail review, and \nthe conduct of ineffective plea negotiations by counsel not aware of the details of the \ncase.  Indeed, it has been observed that a lawyer’s effective advocacy is a critical \nfactor in determining whether arrestees are released shortly after their arrest or \nwhether they spend substantial amounts of time in pretrial incarceration.  See Douglas \nL. Colbert, et al., Do Attorneys Really Matter?  The Empirical and Legal Case for the \nRight of Counsel at Bail, 23 CARDOZO L. REV. 1719, 1763 (2002).  In fact, researchers \nstudying Baltimore’s criminal justice system found that indigent arrestees represented \nby counsel were more than two-and-a-half times as likely to be released on their own \nrecognizance, spending less time in jail.  See id. at 1755.  Such injuries are especially \n                                                                                              \n5  A  copy  of  the  report  is  available  on  the  Internet  at \nhttps://www.nacdl.org/reports/gideonat50/rationingjustice/ (last visited September 8, \n2015). \n17 \n\n \npronounced for defendants who ultimately are acquitted or whose cases are dismissed \nbut  who  nevertheless  lose  licenses,  jobs,  homes,  education,  freedom,  time, \nopportunity, or income as a result of the lack of prompt, effective assistance of \ncounsel.  These injuries are not side effects of every criminal prosecution; rather, they \nstem directly from the kinds of deficient representation alleged in the complaint: \ncounsel who are incapable of conducting adequate legal and factual investigation into \ntheir clients’ cases, unable to communicate promptly with their clients or to meet with \nthem prior to critical events in the process, and otherwise frustrated by crushing \ncaseloads and inadequate  support  resources in their attempt to render effective \nrepresentation. \nLikewise,  an  indigent  accused  may  suffer  harm  if  an  unprepared  and \noverworked  attorney  fails  to  negotiate  a  plea  agreement  and  the  accused  is \nsubsequently convicted and sentenced more harshly than he or she would have been \nunder a negotiated plea.   \nOther potential harms include the potential loss of witnesses or evidence that \nare not identified and secured through prompt and comprehensive discussions with \naccused indigent clients.  The loss of such potentially exculpatory evidence cannot be \nremedied in post-conviction proceedings: it is impossible to establish that the outcome \nof  the  proceeding  would  have  been  different  where  the  evidence  necessary  to \ndemonstrate prejudice has permanently vanished, as it is likely to do in many \n18 \n\n \ntransient, indigent communities.  For these reasons, the ABA has recognized that one \nof counsel’s most important duties is to establish early and regular contact with a \ncriminally accused client so that vital evidence is not lost.  See ABA Defense Attorneys \nFunction Standard 4-3.2: Interviewing the Client (“As soon as practicable, defense \ncounsel should seek to determine all relevant facts known to the accused.”).   \nPost-conviction claims pursuant to Strickland are simply not designed to correct \nall of the deprivations of rights that defendants suffer when they are denied effective \nassistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings.  To be sure, \nStrickland announced a non-exclusive post-conviction process to ensure “confidence \nin the outcome” of criminal proceedings.  466 U.S. at 694.  Strickland did not create a \nremedy for the numerous injuries and prejudices, and especially pre-trial injuries, that \nindigent defendants suffer as a result of the denial of effective counsel.  Even more \nimportant, nothing in Strickland bars courts from addressing systemic problems in the \ncontext of civil litigation concerning the routine denial of constitutional rights that \nineluctably results from the inadequacy of a government’s overall manner of fulfilling \none of its many social responsibilities.   \nA  case-by-case  analysis,  as  is  required  by  post-conviction  review,  is  an \ninappropriate standard to apply to a class claim implicating a wholesale failure of \ngovernment to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants.  This \nstandard simply cannot apply to a case seeking prospective relief to cease and prevent \n19 \n\n \nwidespread, imminent future harm caused by denial of effective counsel at every \ncritical stage of adversary criminal proceedings.  Pre-trial and pre-conviction systemic \ndeficiencies such as those alleged in the Amended Complaint cannot be redressed \nthrough a “wait and see” but-for analysis that hinges on whether a conviction results \nfrom prejudice in an individual case.  As one court has explained, “[w]idespread and \nsystemic instances of deficient performance caused by a poorly equipped appointed-\ncounsel system will not cease and be cured with a case-by-case examination of \nindividual criminal appeals, given that prejudice is generally required and often not \nestablished.”  Duncan v. Michigan, 774 N.W.2d 89, 126 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009), aff’d \non other grounds, 780 N.W.2d 843 (Mich. 2010).  \nInstead, the question in this matter of first impression before this Court is \nwhether the right to counsel can be protected prospectively.  Numerous courts \nthroughout the United States have already held that it can and should be.  See Luckey \nv. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1017 (11th Cir. 1988); Hurrell-Harring v. New York, 930 \nN.E.2d 217 (N.Y. 2010) (allowing claim for constructive denial of effective assistance \nof counsel and noting that systemic deficiencies among public defender offices due to \ninadequate funding created a situation that could not be remedied by Strickland \nreview); Duncan, 774 N.W.2d at 124-32 (rejecting argument that post-conviction \nrelief contemplated by Strickland provided the sole and proper remedy for ineffective \nassistance of counsel). \n20 \n\n \nStrickland review addresses post-conviction harm in individual cases where \ncounsels’  failures  are  so  extreme  that  the  appropriate  remedy  is  reversal  of  a \nconviction.  But that does not mean that in cases in which the lack of effective \nassistance of counsel falls short of the demanding Strickland standard that the right to \neffective assistance of counsel is not being violated systematically.  And it certainly \ndoes not mean that the right cannot be prospectively safeguarded.  The Strickland \nstandard is properly limited to a narrow subset of cases in which ineffective assistance \ndemonstrably resulted in a conviction and is based on considerations of finality of \njudgments, preservation of judicial resources, and reluctance to second-guess strategic \ndecisions of counsel that are not at issue in pretrial proceedings and not a bar to \naddress ongoing system-wide harm. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court explained in a decision announced the same day \nas Strickland that there may be circumstances “present on some occasions when \nalthough counsel is available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any \nlawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that \na presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of \nthe trial.”  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659-60 (1984) (emphasis added).  \nAlthough also a post-conviction case, Cronic acknowledged that there are times when \nthe Strickland standard and its assessment of claimed ineffectiveness on the ultimate \noutcome of a case is unjustified to address the violation of the right to effective \n21 \n\n \nassistance of counsel.  Indeed,  Strickland itself recognized that there are some \ncircumstances in which prejudice will be presumed, such as where the defendant is \nconstructively denied effective assistance of counsel.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696.  In \nsuch cases, the Court explained that prejudice is “so likely that case-by-case inquiry \ninto prejudice is not worth the cost.”  Id. at 696.  In those situations, the deprivations \nof the right to counsel are “easy to identify and . . . easy for the government to \nprevent.”  Id. \nAs described above, the Amended Complaint demonstrates the existence of a \ncrisis affecting OPD’s workload and resources that results in a number of specific and \nmaterial deficiencies in the indigent defense system in Luzerne County.  These \ndeficiencies are so glaring and pervasive that case-by-case inquiry into possible \nprejudice is not worth the cost.  The ways in which the OPD is impaired in its ability \nto meet the minimum requirements of effective representation occur on such a scale \nthat the Amended Complaint states a colorable claim for the constructive denial of \ncounsel that should be permitted to proceed.  Moreover, the Amended Complaint \nreflects an ongoing deficiency in how the Commonwealth attempts to satisfy its \nobligation to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants through \nlocal county governments that, in the case of Luzerne County, fail to meet the \ngovernment’s constitutional obligations to its citizens.  Not only do these deficiencies \naffect the determination of guilt or innocence for the accused, but they also cause \n22 \n\n \nsevere and irremediable collateral harms, such as incarceration, loss of employment, \nand loss of homes among others. \nThe fundamental and pervasive deficiencies in the OPD alleged by Appellants \nKuren and Allabaugh describe a situation in which it is unlikely that “any lawyer, \neven a fully competent one,” would be able to “provide effective assistance.”  Cronic, \n466 U.S. at 659-60.  The deficiencies are so manifest that the injuries they cause—\nincluding injuries that occur prior to trial and conviction—can be seen even “without \ninquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.”  Id.   \nBecause the post-trial review contemplated by Strickland cannot conceivably \nremedy the numerous deprivations of the right to counsel that Appellants Kuren and \nAllabaugh and others similarly situated have suffered and are in imminent danger of \ncontinuing to suffer, not only in Luzerne County but also throughout Pennsylvania \nand in much of the rest of the country, the Commonwealth Court’s ruling should be \nreversed.  Appellants’ constructive denial of counsel claim should be permitted to \nproceed. \nII.  THE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING INDIGENT DEFENSE SERVICES \nARE  SYSTEMIC  AND  EXTEND  THROUGHOUT  THE \nCOMMONWEALTH AND THE NATION \nAs noted above, the problems facing the OPD fall within a larger pattern of \ndeep-rooted  problems  that  result  from  local  governments  underfunding  public \ndefenders throughout Pennsylvania and that routinely cause violations of indigent \n23 \n\n \ndefendants’ right to effective assistance of counsel.  These problems are numerous and \npervasive, ranging from excessive caseloads, lack of support staff, and lack of \nresources to lack of training, inability to implement standards for representation, and \ninability to supervise staff to ensure quality of representation.  Without the ability to \npursue prospective relief to avert these problems, innumerable indigent defendants \nwill continue to see their constitutional rights to counsel  violated in ways that \nseriously harm them. \nRecent  studies  have  shown  that  overworked  and  under-resourced  public \ndefender  offices  create  systemic  problems  that  prevent  defense  attorneys  from \nrendering effective assistance to their indigent clients.  The problems facing the public \ndefenders in Pennsylvania go back decades. \nIn 2011, the Pennsylvania’s General Assembly’s Joint State Government \nCommission’s Task Force and Advisory Committee on Services to Indigent Criminal \nDefendants issued a report that highlighted the areas in which indigent defense in \nPennsylvania was falling short of the constitutional mandate.  The Task Force \nmeasured  Pennsylvania’s  indigent  defense  system  against  the  American  Bar \nAssociation’s  “Ten  Principles  of  a  Public  Defense  Delivery  System,”  a  set  of \nnationally accepted criteria for indigent defense system reform.  With regard to each \nof  the  ten  principles,  Pennsylvania’s  indigent  defense system  exhibited serious \ndeficiencies. \n24 \n\n \nFor example, the Pennsylvania system requires local county governments to \nfund indigent defense efforts.6  This creates a system in which the indigent defense \nsystem in many counties is not independent but “subject to interference from the \njudiciary, the county commissioners, or both.”  Task Force Report at 6.   \nFurthermore, although proper, effective representation requires that a defense \nattorney be appointed as soon as possible following a defendant’s arrest and meet with \nthe accused prior to a preliminary hearing, there are counties in Pennsylvania where \nthe attorney is not appointed and does not even meet the client until the preliminary \nhearing.  Id. \nMost significantly, underfunding leads to a shortage of staff, which in turn leads \nto excessive case workloads for staff attorneys.  Consequently, the Task Force Report \nnotes that the majority of counties in Pennsylvania have public defender offices in \nwhich “attorney workloads substantially exceed recommended limits.”  Id. at 7.  This \nis  one  of  the  most  insidious  problems  facing  the  indigent  defense  system  in \nPennsylvania because overworked attorneys, no matter how talented, are not capable \nof rendering the basic minimum services required to provide effective assistance at all \n                                                                                              \n6 Pennsylvania is one of two remaining states in the country that does not fund its \nindigent defense system at the state level to meet its constitutional obligation to \nprovide effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants.  The only other state in \nthis category is Utah. \n25 \n\n \ncritical stages of a defendant’s journey through the adversary criminal process.  Id. at \n73-78.   \nThese systemic problems are not going away.  To the contrary, they are \nendemic.  They do not manifest themselves only in the occasional individual case.  \nAccordingly, they require an institutional solution, not an individualistic one.  Many \nof the deficiencies identified in the findings of the Task Force are nearly identical to \nthose identified almost a decade earlier in the Final Report of the Pennsylvania \nSupreme Court Committee on Racial and Gender Bias in the Judicial System issued in \n2003.  See Task Force Report at 5.   \nIndeed,  many  of  the  problems  identified  in  the  Task Force Report  were \nidentified decades earlier.  In 1995, the Spangenberg Group, on behalf of the ABA \nBar  Information  Program,  conducted  a  study  of  the  Allegheny  County  Public \nDefender’s Office.  See A Review of the Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) Public \nDefender Office (November 1995) (the “Spangenberg Report”).7  After site visits and \nanalysis of budgetary and caseload data, the Spangenberg Group concluded that the \ncaseload was “overwhelming” for the office.  Spangenberg Report at 6.  The office \nfailed to meet the majority of the ABA standards applicable to proper representation \nof criminal defendants.  See id. at 8.  Problems identified in the Spangenberg Report \n                                                                                              \n7  A  copy  of  the  Spangenberg  Report  is  available  on  the  Internet  at \nhttp://www.nlada.net/sites/default/files/pa_alleghenycounty_tsgreport_111995.pdf \n(last visited September 8, 2015).   \n26 \n\n \nincluded salaries for staff attorneys that were far too low, inadequate office space and \nresources, conflicts of interest arising because the county commissioners had the \npower to hire and fire the public defender at will, a lack of staff resources to conduct \nfactual investigations of the clients’ cases (as opposed to mere interviews), a lack of \nwritten standards, and a great disparity between the support the district attorney’s \noffice received from local government and the much lower amount of support the \npublic defender’s office received.  In short, the Spangenberg Report demonstrates that \nmany of the problems identified in the Task Force Report are systemic problems that \nhave existed for decades. \nAlthough  Pennsylvania’s  method of  using local government  to  fund  and \nprovide indigent defense services contributes to these systemic problems, the need for \nreform extends beyond Pennsylvania.  In April 2009, the National Right to Counsel \nCommittee of The Constitution Project issued a report finding that the American \njustice system  as  a  whole  was failing  to  provide  adequate counsel  to  indigent \ndefendants in criminal and juvenile delinquency cases.  See Justice Denied: America’s \nContinuing Neglect of Our Constitutional Right to Counsel (April 2009) (the “Right to \nCounsel Report”).8  The Right to Counsel Committee undertook to examine whether \nindigent defendants received “adequate legal representation, consistent with decisions \n                                                                                              \n8  A  copy  of  the  Right  to  Counsel  Report  is  available  on  the  Internet  at \nhttp://www.constitutionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/139.pdf (last visited \non September 8, 2015).   \n27 \n\n \nof the Supreme Court and rules of the legal profession.”  Right to Counsel Report at 3.  \nThe report noted that, although there were a few exceptions, “[i]n most of the country, \nnotwithstanding the dedication of lawyers and other committed staff, quality defense \nwork is simply impossible because of inadequate funding, excessive caseloads, a lack \nof genuine independence, and insufficient availability of other essential resources.”  \nId. at 4.   \nThe Right to Counsel Committee identified inadequate funding as the root \ncause of many of the systemic problems for indigent defense in the country.  Right to \nCounsel Report at 6-7.  The most direct consequence of inadequate funding “is \nattorneys attempting to provide defense services while carrying astonishingly large \ncaseloads.”  Id. at 7.  The consequences of inadequate funding and overwhelming \ncaseloads the Right to Counsel Report identifies are identical to those identified in the \nTask Force Report and include the inability to interview clients properly, the inability \nto comply with professional and ethical standards, the inability to prepare adequately \nfor hearings, the inability to be effective in seeking pretrial release, the inability to \nengage in proper motion practice or to conduct factual investigations, and the inability \nto negotiate in any meaningful way with the prosecutor on behalf of the clients.  Id.   \nThe threat that these systemic problems pose to the rights of the indigent \naccused are substantial and long-standing.  As explained by the Right to Counsel \nReport, public defenders’ offices have been chronically underfunded.  Right to \n28 \n\n \nCounsel Report at 50-52.  This underfunding results in staggering caseloads for \nindigent defense attorneys throughout the country and impairs their ability to deliver \neffective assistance.  See id. at 65.  At the same time, the problems inadequate \nrepresentation pose to indigent defendants have become more complex and include \nmore numerous collateral consequences.  See id. at 72.  NACDL issued several \ncarefully-researched reports on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Gideon v. \nWainwright,  372  U.S.  335  (1963),  reaching  the  same  conclusions.    See \nwww.nacdl.org/reports. \nSignificantly to this case, the Right to Counsel Report identified litigation \nefforts, including cases similar to this case, as one of the principal avenues to reform \nthis badly broken indigent defense system.  See Right to Counsel Report at 9, 103-28.  \nSuch litigation efforts invoke the courts’ “inherent authority to protect the core \nfunctions of the judiciary, their equity jurisdiction, and their powers of general \nsuperintendence.”  Id. at 130.   \nIn the face of these systemic problems, this Court should permit Appellants \nKuren and Allabaugh to proceed with their case for prospective relief to protect their \nconstitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of their \ninvolvement in the adversary criminal process. \n29 \n\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor all the foregoing reasons and those stated in the brief of Appellants Kuren \nand  Allabaugh,  the  National  Association  of  Criminal  Defense  Lawyers  and \nPennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers urge that the decision of the \nCommonwealth Court be reversed.   \n          Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Arleigh P.
