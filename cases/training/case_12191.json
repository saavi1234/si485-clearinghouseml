    "summary": "<p>On October 31, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. The U.S. sued the State of South Carolina under the Supremacy Clause and the Immigration and Nationality Act, seeking an injunction barring the enforcement of South Carolina's recently passed immigration bill, Act 69.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the federal government challenged Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Act 69. These sections required state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of any individual they stopped, detained, or arrested whenever they had a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the individual lacked immigration status. They further allowed law enforcement officers to arrest individuals solely for failing to carry registration documents and made it a crime to harbor or transport an undocumented immigrant or to be harbored or transported if one is an undocumented immigrant. The government also challenged Section 15, which made it a crime to create or repeatedly use a false identification.</p>\r\n<p>(In passing Act 69, South Carolina joined Utah, Indiana, Georgia and Alabama in enacting immigration laws similar to Arizona's Senate Bill 1070. For the case challenging the Arizona law, see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States v. Arizona</a>; for the case challenging Utah's HB 497, see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12194\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Utah Coalition of La Raza v. Herbert</a>; for the case challenging Indiana's SEA 590, see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12181\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buquer v. City of Indianapolis</a>; for the case challenging Georgia's HB 87, see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=10523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Deal</a>; and for cases challenging Alabama's HB 56, see <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/case/12184/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States v. Alabama</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hispanic Interest Coalition v. Bentley</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parsley v. Bentley).</a></p>\r\n<p>After a joint hearing on motions for summary judgment by the Department of Justice and by private plaintiffs in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lowcountry Immigration Coalition v. Haley</a>, on December 22, 2011, United States District Judge Richard M. Gergel issued an order in large part granting both motions. United States v. South Carolina, No. 2:11-cv-02958, 2011 WL 6973241, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151549 (D.S.C. Dec. 19, 2011). The court enjoined Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act, but declined to enjoin Section 15, as it found that the federal government had not made a clear showing it would suffer irreparable harm if the section were enforced.</p>\r\n<p>The State appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which stayed the case until the Supreme Court issued its decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States v. Arizona</a>, which dealt with a very similar statute in Arizona. In June 2012, the Supreme Court struck down much of the Arizona statute, but declined to facially review the \"show me your papers\" provision. 132 S.Ct. 2492 (2012). Shortly thereafter, the Court of Appeals issued a \"limited remand\" in this matter, directing the district court to decide in the first instance if its order should be adjusted in light of the Supreme Court's Arizona opinion.</p>\r\n<p>On November 26, 2012, the district court left in place most of its prior preliminary injunction, against the sections of the law that aimed to criminalize unlawful presence and giving a ride or renting an apartment to an undocumented immigrant. But the district court followed the Supreme Court's lead on the \"show me your papers\" provision. It noted: \"This litigation is only at the preliminary injunction stage, and this Court's decision to dissolve the injunction regarding these status-checking provisions does not foreclose a future as-applied challenge based upon subsequent factual and legal developments. In the course of this litigation, the parties will have the opportunity to conduct discovery regarding the actual practices and procedures associated with the implementation of Sections 6(A) and 6(C)(1), and this Court can then address these issues with the benefit of a full record.\"</p>\r\n<p>On December 7, 2012, the State filed an interlocutory appeal of the District Court's preliminary injunction. On July 23, 3013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision.</p>\r\n<p>Litigation then continued at the district court and the parties began settlement discussions. On March 4, 2015, Judge Gergel permanently enjoined the State from implementing Sections 4, 5, 6(B)(2), and 15 of South Carolina's Act 69. He further noted that the Department of Justice had agreed to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice</p>\r\n<p>their remaining claims as to Sections 6 and 7 based on the State's specified interpretations of these sections.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then began litigation over attorney's fees, but no further action has been taken since June 6, 2014. The case appears closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This is a challenge brought by the federal government to the constitutionality of a South Carolina immigration law which requires state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the individual lacks immigration status, allows law enforcement officers to arrest individuals solely for failing to carry registration documents, makes it a crime to harbor or transport an undocumented immigrant or to be harbored or transported by others if one is an undocumented immigrant, and imposes civil liability on the police for failing to enforce its provisions to the maximum extent possible. The law was patterned after Arizona's SB 1070. In December 2011, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the law; this was reaffirmed in major part in November 2012, after the Supreme Court addressed the similar Arizona statute in United States v. Arizona. On March 4, 2015, Judge Gergel permanently enjoined the State from implementing Sections 4, 5, 6(B)(2), and 15 of South Carolina's Act 69.",

United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012) (hereinafter “Arizona decision”), issued\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 2 of 16\non June 25, 2012.  (Dkt. No. 98).1  This limited remand followed this Court’s “indicative ruling,”\nissued pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 on July 9, 2012, that the United States\nSupreme Court’s Arizona decision raised “substantial issues” regarding at least a portion of this\nCourt’s earlier decision.  (Dkt. No.9 2).  Upon the grant of the limited remand, this Court established\na briefing schedule and set oral argument for November 13, 2012.  (Dkt. No. 102).  After a careful\nconsideration of the relevant precedents, including the Arizona decision, the full record before the\nCourt, and the written and oral arguments of all parties to these actions, the Court hereby modifies\nits earlier order in regard to portions of Section  6 of S.C. Act No. 69 (hereinafter “Act 69”) and\nleaves in place the grant of preliminary injunctive relief regarding Sections 4(A), (B), (C) and (D),\n5, and 6(B)(2) of Act 69, as further set forth below.\nBackground\nThe South Carolina General Assembly formally adopted a comprehensive state immigration\nstatute, Act 69, on June 27, 2011.  A num ber of individuals and advocacy groups (hereina fter\ncollectively “private Plaintiffs”) filed suit on October 12, 2011 challenging Act 69 in its entirety as\nwell as specific portions of the Act and requesting prelim inary and permanent injunctive relief. \n(C.A. No. 2:11-2779, Dkt. No. 1).  Thereafter, the United States filed a separate action on October\n31, 2011 challenging the validity of Sections 4, 5, 6an d 15 of Act 69 and requesting preliminary and\npermanent injunctive relief.  (Dkt. No. 1).  Because Act 69 was setto  take effect on January 1, 2012,\nthe Court set an expedited briefing schedule onN  ovember 1, 2011 and scheduled oral argument on\nDecember 19, 2011.  The Court issued an order on Decem ber 22, 2011 preliminarily enjoining\n1 All citations to the case docket will be to C.A. No. 2:11-2958 unless specifically\nindicated otherwise.\n-2-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 3 of 16\nSections 4(A), (B), (C), and (D), 5, and 6 of Act 69.  United States v. South Carolina, 840 F. Supp.\n2d 898 (D.S.C. 2011).  As referenced above, this Court now reviews this preliminary injunction in\nlight of the Arizona decision. \nDiscussion\nThe above captioned parties have, somewhat predictably, taken different views on the issues\nbefore the Court in this limited remand.  The state Defendants2 assert that the Court should dissolve\nthe preliminary injunction in its entirety despite the United States Suprem e Court affirming\nsignificant portions of the Arizona district court and Ninth Circuit opinions that declared multiple\nand, in many instances, similar provisions of Arizona’s immigration statute unconstitutional.  (Dkt.\nNos. 105, 110, 113).  The private Plaintiffs urge the Court to m aintain the previously is sued\npreliminary injunction, including the section enjoining immigration inquiries for persons lawfully\nstopped or detained for other reasons, notwithstanding the fact that the Arizona decision reversed\nlower court decisions enjoining a similar provision of the Arizona statute.  (Dkt. No. 106; C.A. No.\n2:11-2779, Dkt. Nos. 154, 158).  The United Sattes asserts that, in light of theA rizona decision, this\nCourt should dissolve that portion of the preliminary injunction relating to immigration inquiries for\npersons lawfully stopped or detained and, in all  other respects, maintain the Court’s previously\ngranted preliminary injunctive relief.  (Dkt. Nos. 107, 111).  The Court will address each relevant\nsection of Act 69 below.\n2 The term “state Defendants” refers collectively to the named defendants in the two\nabove captioned actions.\n-3-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 4 of 16\nA. Sections 4(B) and (D)\nSections 4(B) and (D) of Act 69 established two new state criminal provisions relating to\npersons who knowingly or recklessly participate in the transporting or sheltering of persons in\nfurtherance of an unlawfully present person’s entry into the United States or to avoid detection of\nsuch a person’s unlawful presence.  These newly adopted state provisions are similar to existing\nprovisions of federal law.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(1)(a)(ii), (iii).  The federal law authorizes state and\nlocal law enforcement officials to make arrests under the federal statute but prosecution remains\nexclusively within the discretion of the federal government.  Id. § 1324(c).  This Court enjoined\nSections 4(B) and (D) of Act 69, stating that this was a “classic case of field preemption”  because\nCongress had “adopted a scheme of federal regulation regarding the harboring and transporting of\nunlawfully present persons so pervasive that it left no room in this area for the state to supplement\nit.”  United States v. South Carolina, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 916-17. \nThe state Defendants now argue that the Arizona decision did not specifically address this\nissue and point out that the Arizona district court had earlier refused to enjoin a provision similar\nto Sections 4(B) and (D).  (Dkt. No. 105 at 9) .  Though the state Defendants are correct that the\nUnited States Supreme Court did not address si milar harboring and sheltering provisions in it s\nArizona decision, they fail to appreciate that this is because the issue was not raised on appeal.  In\nfact, there is little in the Arizona decision that gives support to the state Defendants’ argument. \nIn examining Section 3 of the Arizona statute, relating to a new state misdemeanor for failing\nto carry an alien regi stration card, the Suprem e Court noted that there was overlap with a\ncomprehensive federal regulatory sche me concerning the documentation requirements of alien\npersons within the United States.  Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2501-03.  The Supreme\n-4-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 5 of 16\nCourt, in declaring the Arizona statute preempted, noted that “[p]ermitting the State to impose its\nown penalties for the federal of fenses here would create conflict with the caref ul framework\nCongress adopted.”  Id. at 2502. \nIn addition, in two post-Arizona decisions the Eleventh Circuit enjoined similar transporting\nand sheltering provisions found in the Alabama and Georgia statutes.  See Ga. Latino Alliance for\nHuman Rights v. Georgia, 691 F.3d 1250, 1263-67 (11th Cir .2012) (hereinafter “GLAHR”); United\nStates v. Alabama, 691 F.3d 1269, 1285-88 (11th Cir. 2012) .T he Eleventh Circuit inG  LAHR found\nthat the federal criminal provisions relating to harboring and transporting unlawfully present persons\nwere “comprehensive” and that the “breadth of these laws illustrates an overwhelming dominant\nfederal interest in the field.”  691 F.3d at 1264.  The  GLAHR court further found that Georgia’s\nharboring and sheltering statute “threaten[ed] the uniform application” of federal immigration law\nand challenged “federal supremacy in the realm of immigration.”  Id. at 1265-66.  Based on that\nreasoning, the Eleventh Circuit found the Georgias tatutory provision preempted by federal law, id.\nat 1267, as well as the Alabama provision in the companion case, United States v. Alabama, 691\nF.3d at 1290.\nFurther, the Arizona district court recentlyr evisited the sheltering and harboring provisions\nof the Arizona statute in a new suit brought by private litigants.  See Valle del Sol v. Whiting, No.\n10-1061 (D. Ariz. Sept. 5, 2012) (order granting prelim inary injunction).3  The Arizona district\ncourt, though it had twice rejected arguments invalidating the harboring and sheltering provisions\nof the Arizona immigration statute, relied heavily ont he analysis contained in the Eleventh Circuit’s\ndecisions in GLAHR and United States v. Alabama and ultimately concluded that the Arizona statute\n3 This decision is apparently not currently published but can be found at Dkt. No. 105-1.\n-5-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 6 of 16\nwas field and conflict preempted.  (Dkt. No. 105-1 at 8).\nThis Court, having carefully considered the arguments of all parties and the recent case law\non this issue, continues to find that Sections 4(B) and (D) infringe upon a comprehensive federal\nstatutory scheme and would interfere with the federal governm ent’s supremacy in the realm of\nimmigration.  Further, the South Carolina statutoryp rovisions would allow state officials to exercise\ndiscretion regarding the prosecution of persons lalegedly harboring or sheltering persons unlawfully\npresent in the United States, creating a conlfict with federal law since that discretion has previously\nbeen the exclusive province of the federal government.  Consequently, the Court leaves in place its\npreliminary injunction regarding Sections 4(B) and (D) of Act 69.\nB. Sections 4(A) and (C)\nSections 4(A) and (C) make it a state criminal offense for persons unlawfully present in the\nUnited States “to allow themselves to be transported” or to “conceal, harbor or shelter themselves\nfrom detection.”  In granting the Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction, this Court found that\nthese provisions, which apparently have no counterpart in state or federal law, were the functional\nequivalent of making unlawful presence a criminal offense.  United States v. South Carolina, 840\nF. Supp. 2d at 919.  This Court concluded that these provisions were field and conflict preempted\nbecause they “seek to criminalize what Congress has chosen to treat only as a civil offense.”  Id.\nThe state Defendants assert that since no othe r state has “self harboring provisions,” and\nconsequently no other court has addressed the validity of such statutes, this Court should dissolve\nits injunction.  (Dkt. No. 105 at 10).  This Court finds that argum ent unpersuasive.  The Arizona\ndecision only served to underscore that, in a realm where Congress has enacted a comprehensive\nframework for addressing a national issue and judged that a particular activity is best enforced as\n-6-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 7 of 16\na civil matter, any effort by a State to criminalize that activity creates a “conflict in the method of\nenforcement” that stands as “an obstacle to ther egulatory system Congress chose” and is, therefore,\n“preempted by federal law.”  See Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2505 (concluding that a\nState effort to criminalize seeking or engaging in unauthorized em ployment is preempted by a\nfederal statute that instead imposes civil penalties on employees).  \nSections 4(A) and (C) represent just such an effort to criminalize an activity that is, under\nfederal law, deemed a civil violation.  The provsiions place criminal sanctions on the sheltering and\ntransporting of one’s self—activities that are, practically speaking, unavoidable.  In effect, Sections\n4(A) and (C) criminalize removable aliens’ presence in the State, and do so despite the Suprem e\nCourt’s affirmation in Arizona that, “[a]s a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to\nremain present in the United States.”   Id.  As a result, like Arizona’s attem pt to criminalize\nunauthorized work after Congress had judged it a civil matter, Sections 4(A) and (C) necessarily\nconflict with federal policy judgments relating to removability, and are therefore preempted by\nfederal law. \nThis Court continues to find South Carolina’s “self harboring” statute as conflicting with a\nwell ordered and settled federal statutory scheme for dealing with unlawfully present persons and\nthat it is preempted by federal law.  Thus, the Court finds no basis to alter its preliminary injunction\nregarding Sections 4(A) and (C).\nC. Sections 5 and 6(B)(2)\nSection 5 of Act 69 makes it a state misdemeanor for a person eighteen years or older not\nto carry an alien registration card issued pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1304.  Section 6(B)(2) of Act 69\nmakes it unlawful for any person to possess “false,f ictitious, fraudulent or counterfeit identification”\n-7-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 8 of 16\nfor purposes of offering proof of one’s lawful presence in the United States.  This Court previously\nenjoined these provisions because, given that “the national government has adopted a pervasive and\ncomprehensive scheme that leaves no place for state regulation in this area,” it is clear that “alien\nregistration is a field under the exclusive control of the federal government.”  United States v. South\nCarolina, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 917-18.\nIn the Arizona case, the Supreme Court confronted a new state misdemeanor statute that\nprohibited “willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document . . . in violation of 8\nUnited States Code section 1304(e) or 1306(a).”  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 11-1509(A).  Affirming\nthat the “States may not enter, in any respect, an ar ea the Federal Government has reserved for\nitself,” and observing in particular that “[f]ede ral law makes a single sovereign responsible fo r\nmaintaining a comprehensive and unified system  to keep track of alie ns within the Nation’s\nborders,” the Supreme Court concluded that, in regard to alien registration, “[p]ermitting the State\nto impose its own penalties f or the federal offenses would conflict with the careful framework\nCongress adopted.”  Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2502.  Notably, like this Court in its\nearlier order in this case ,the Supreme Court in Arizona recognized that preemption here is necessary\nand comprehensive because the federal scheme for alien registration “touches on foreign relations.” \nId.  The Court therefore found the provision preempted.  \nDespite the Supreme Court’s unequivocal statem ent that alien registration is a field\npreempted by federal law, the state Defendants contniue to assert that this Court should dissolve its\ninjunction regarding Sections 5 and 6(B)(2).  (Dkt. No. 105 at 11-12).  This Court sees nothing in\nthe Arizona decision that would call for dissolving this portion of the injunction, and indeed views\nArizona as precedent supporting the decision to keep the injunction in place.  The Court continues\n-8-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 9 of 16\nto find that the area of a lien registration is field preempted from state regulation and leaves\nundisturbed its preliminary injunction regarding Sections 5 and 6(B)(2) of Act 69.\nD. Sections 6(A), (B)(1), (C)(1)-(3), and (D)\nSection 6(A) of Act 69 mandates that a state or local law enforcement officer who lawfully\nstops a person for a criminal offense and has a “reasonable suspicion” that “the person is unlawfully\npresent  in the United States”   must  make  a “reasonable effort” to determ ine  that person’ s\nimmigration status.  Section 6(B)(1) allows the use o cfertain official picture identifications to create\na presumption of a person’s lawful presence.  If the person under suspicion does not possess one of\nthe designated forms of identification, the officerm  ust make a “reasonable effort, when practicable,\nto verify the person’s lawful presence.”  S.C. Act 69, § 6(C)(1).  Thi csan include inquiries to federal\nimmigration officials or a newly created state immigration enforcement unit.  Id.  The statute goes\non to provide that any stop or detention may not be longer than “a reasonable amount of time as\nallowed by law” and m ust be consistent with federal im migration law and the United States\nConstitution.  Id. §§ 6(C)(2), (D).\nThe Supreme Court addressed a similar provision in the Arizona statute, Section 2(B), and\nexpressed concerns regarding the possible detention or holding of persons simply to verify their\nimmigration status.  The Supreme Court noted that “[d]etaining individuals solely to verify their\nimmigration status would raise constitutional concerns.”   Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. at\n2509.  Further, the Supreme Court observed that “it would disrupt the federal framework to put state\nofficers in the position of holding aliens in custody for possible unlawful presence without federal\ndirection and supervision.”  Id.  The Supreme Court went on to hold, however, that if the Arizona\nstatute “only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the course of an authorized,\n-9-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 10 of 16\nlawful  detention or after a detainee has been   released, the provision l ikely  would survive\npreemption—at least absent some showing that it haso ther consequences that are adverse to federal\nlaw and its objectives.”  Id.\nThus, though it recognized significant limitations on the authority of the State to detain a\nperson suspected of being unlawfully present in the United States, the Supreme Court found that it\nwas possible that the Arizona s tatute might be interpreted by the state courts “to avoid these\nconcerns.”  Id.  The Court explained that, where “[t]here is a basic uncertainty about what the law\nmeans and how it will be enforced,” it would be “inappropriate to assume [the provision] will be\nconstrued in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.”  Id. at 2510.  As a result, the Supreme\nCourt held that enjoining the Arizona statute on the basis of a  facial challenge was not proper,\nthough the Court made a point not to “foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to\nthe law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.”  Id.\nThis Court earlier enjoined the immigration inquiry provisions of Section 6, holding at the\ntime that such inquiries potentially burdened and disrupted “finite and limited federal immigration\nenforcement resources” and interfered with federal control over matters potentially affecting the\nforeign affairs of the United States. U  nited States v. South Carolina, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 924.  Courts\nreviewing the constitutionality of the Arizona and Georgia immigration statutes reached similar\nconclusions.  See United States v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d 980, 993-98 (D. Ariz. 2010),a ff’d, 641\nF.3d 339, 348-54 (9th Cir. 2011); GLAHR, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 1330-33.  But see United States v.\nAlabama, 813 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1318-29 (N.D. Ala. 2011).  \nThe Supreme Court in the Arizona decision concluded otherwise.  In doing so, the Court\nobserved that the requesting of immigration status information by state and local officials from the\n-10-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 11 of 16\nfederal government was explicitly authorized under federal law and “[i]ndeed, [Congress] has\nencouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations.”  Arizona v. United\nStates, 132 S. Ct. at 2508.  Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that the “federal scheme . . . leaves\nroom for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter.”  Id.\nThe private Plaintiffs argue that Sections  6(A) and 6(C)(1) will inevitably lead to the\ndetention of persons solely to verify their im migration status.  They make this argument on the\npremise that the time necessary to conduct an immigration status inquiry will routinely exceed the\ntime reasonably necessary t o complete the law en forcement work associated with the original\npurpose of a stop or detention.  (Dkt. No. 106 at 15-18).  The Arizona decision leaves little doubt\nthat, should such detentions occur, they wouldr aise constitutional concerns.  132 S. Ct. at 2509;s ee\nalso Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 333 (2009) (“An officer’s inquiries into matters unrelated\nto the justification for the traffic stop . . . do not convert the encounter into something other than a\nlawful seizure, so long as t hose inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.”);\nIllinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005) (“A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in\nissuing a warning ticket to the driver can b ecome unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time\nreasonably required to complete that mission.”).\nThe state Defendants argue, as did the defendants in Arizona, that the immigration inquiry\nstatute can be interpreted to avoid such  unconstitutional detentions.  For example, the Arizona\ndecision noted that, simply because the state st atute mandated the initiation of an im migration\ninquiry, it did not require that the inquiry be completed while the person under suspicion is being\nstopped or detained.  132 S. Ct. at 2509.  Further, Section 6(C)(2) provides that a person may be\ndetained “only for a reasonable am ount of time as allowed by law” and that, if the person’s\n-11-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 12 of 16\nimmigration status cannot be determined in such time, “the officer may not further . . . detain . . . the\nperson solely on the person’s lawful presence in the United States.”  Additiona lly, Section 6(D)\nprovides that Section 6 must be construed consistently with federal immigration law and the United\nStates Constitution.    \nApplying the holding of the Arizona decision to the status-checking provisions of Act 69,\nin particular Sections 6(A), (B)(1), (C)(1)-(3), and (D), this Court concludes that an injunction at this\nstage of the litigation is not appropriate, and hereby dissolves its preliminary injunction regarding\nthese provisions.  This litigation is only at the prlieminary injunction stage, and this Court’s decision\nto dissolve the injunction regarding these status-checking provisions does not foreclose a future as-\napplied challenge based upon subsequent factual and legal developments.  In the course of this\nlitigation, the parties will have the opportunity to conduct discovery regarding the actual practices\nand procedures associated with the implementation of Sections 6(A) and 6(C)(1), and this Court can\nthen address these issues with the benefit of a full record.4\n4 For example, the Court is aware from an affidavit filed by an official with the Law\nEnforcement Support Center, which administers the immigration status inquiry program, that the\ntime necessary to initiate and complete an immigration inquiry is estimated to take on average 81\nminutes.  (Dkt. No. 16-7 at 10, 12-13).  A detention of a person suspected of being unlawfully\npresent in the United States for this period of time simply to determine immigration status would\nraise constitutional concerns.  See United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 709-10 (1983)\n(“[A]lthough we decline to adopt any outside time limitation for a permissible Terry stop, we\nhave never approved a seizure of the person for the prolonged 90-minute period involved\nhere . . . .”); United States v. McFarley, 991 F.2d 1188, 1193-94 (4th Cir. 1993) (“[W]e hold that\n38 minutes is not per se an unreasonably long time period in which to conduct that limited\ninvestigation.”).  A legitimate line of inquiry in discovery would be whether law enforcement\nofficers, in circumstances where the work associated with the original purpose of the stop or\ndetention has been completed, terminate or prolong the detention while awaiting the completion\nof the immigration status inquiry. \n-12-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 13 of 16\nE. Section 6(C)(4)\nSection 6(C)(4) of Act 69 provides that, if a astte or local law enforcement officer determines\nthat a person is unlawfully present in the United States, the officer “shall determine in cooperation\nwith” state and federal immigration officials whether the officer will retain custody relating to the\ncriminal offense which led to the initial stop or detention or whether state or federal immigration\nagencies “shall assume custody of the person.”  The subsection goes on to provide that the “officer\nmay securely transport the person to a federal facility in this State or to any other point of transfer\ninto federal custody that is outside of the officer’ jsurisdiction,” provided that the officer must obtain\njudicial authorization if the transporting of th e person to federal custody is outside of South\nCarolina.\nIn granting a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of this subsection, this Court\ninterpreted the statutory language as authorizing satte and local law enforcement officials to deliver\npersons determined to be unlawfully present in the United States to any federal facility without\nfederal authorization.  United States v. South Carolina, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 923.  Following the clear\nand unequivocal language of the  Arizona decision that the State “holding aliens in custody for\npossible unlawful presence without federal direction and supervision” would “disrupt the federal\nframework,” Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2509, the state Defendants now a ssert that\nSection 6(C)(4) “is not interpreted by [the state Defendants] or the Department of Public Safety to\npermit the detention of individuals based on immigration status pending and during transfer unless\nauthorized by federal officials.”  (Dkt. No. 113 at 3-4).5\n5 The state Defendants have filed an affidavit executed by the commander of the newly\ncreated Immigration Enforcement Unit at the South Carolina Department of Public Safety to\nprovide factual support for this statement.  (Dkt. No. 115).\n-13-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 14 of 16\nThis Court is mindful of the Supreme Court’s admonition in the Arizona decision that it\nshould exercise restraint in granting preliminary injunctive relief as a result of a facial challenge\nwhere there is “basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced.”  Arizona\nv. United States, 132 S. Ct. at 2510.  Further, the  Arizona Court noted that the State had placed\ncertain “limits” on its law, including providing that the law would be “im plemented in a manner\nconsistent with federal law regarding im migration, protecting civil rights of all pe rsons and\nrespecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.”  Id. at 2508.  \nSouth Carolina included nearly identical li miting language in its immigration statute at\nSection 6(D).  Interpreting the whole of Section 6 in light of the restrictions on state authority set\nforth in Arizona, and considering the new and unequivocal statem ent of the State that it cannot\ndetain or transport to a federal facility any person for alleged unlawful presence without expr ess\nfederal supervision and authorization, the Court recognizes the possibility that Section 6(C)(4) can\nbe interpreted and enforced in a manner consistent with federal law.  Therefore, the Court finds that,\nat this stage of the litigation, it is appropriate to dissolve the injunction as to Section 6(C)(4).  This\naction does not, however, foreclose a later as-applied challenge to this provision should the law be\nimplemented in a manner inconsistent with federal law.\nF. Section 7(E)\nThe private Plaintiffs urge the Court to consider enjoining Section 7(E) of Act 69 because\nit mandates that, upon the completion of any “sentence of incarceration” by a person unlawfully\npresent in the United States, the jailer “shall securely transport the prisoner to a federal facility.” \n(Dkt. No. 106 at 22).  The privateP laintiffs argue that this provision undermines federal control over\nimmigration and raises significant Fourth Amendment issues.  (Id. at 23-24).  They also correctly\n-14-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 15 of 16\nnote that the Court previously declined to address the Section 7 issues because the granting of the\npreliminary injunction regarding Sections 4, 5, and 6l argely eliminated the risk of being adversely\naffected by Section 7.  The private Plaintiffs contend that, should the Court dissolve any portion of\nthe previously issued injunction, it should revisit the issue of whether an injunction is appropriate\nregarding Section 7 of the Act.  The s tate Defendants assert that consideration of an injunction\nregarding Section 7 goes beyond the scope of the limited remand granted by the Fourth Circuit. \n(Dkt. No. 113 at 11).\nWhile the Court is not persuaded that consideration of Section 7(E) is beyond the scope of\nthe limited remand, the Court concludes that the private Plaintiffs have significant standing problems\nassociated with a challenge to this particular porvision.  For a party to satisfy the threshold question\nof standing, the party must demonstrate that it is under threat of suffering an injury in fact that is\n“concrete  and particularized; the threat m ust  be actual and i mminent,  not conjectural or\nhypothetical.”  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009).  Though a plaintiff who\nseeks preventive relief while challenging a statute need not await actual injury to have standing, that\nplaintiff must nonetheless face a realistic danger ofs ustaining a direct injury through the application\nof that statute.  See Babbit v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979).  \nAlthough some of the private Plaintiffs may be unlawfully present in the United States, none\nhas pleaded a realistic danger of sustaining injury through the application of Section 7(E).  Section\n7(E) potentially impacts persons who have been arrested, tried, convicted, incarcerated and are then\nexpecting release following the completion of their sentence.6  The threat of injury resulting from\n6 In this way, standing to challenge Section 7(E) differs from cases in which plaintiffs\nfacing a threat of prosecution have standing to challenge a criminal statute.  See, e.g., Virginia v.\nAm. Booksellers Ass’n, 484 U.S. 383 (1988); Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 (1974). \n-15-\n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 11/15/12    Entry Number 118     Page 16 of 16\nthe application of Section 7(E) only faces individuals who, it can be expected, will at some point be\nreleased from incarceration.  None of the private Plaintiffs claims to have been arrested, let alone\nto be currently incarcerated.  As ar esult, the Court finds that the potential injury to any of the private\nPlaintiffs is too rem ote, contingent, and speculative at this tim e to satisfy Article III standing\nrequirements regarding Section 7(E).\nConclusion\nBased upon the foregoing, the Court hereby dissolves the preliminary injunction regarding\nSection 6 of Act 69, except as to Section 6(B)(2),  and leaves in place all other aspects of the\npreliminary injunction issued on December 22, 2011.\nAND IT IS SO ORDERED.\ns/ Richard M. Gergel\nRichard Mark Gergel\nUnited States District Judge\nCharleston, South Carolina\nNovember 15, 2012\nThe plaintiffs in those cases were directly injured because their conduct, which they alleged was\nconstitutionally protected, was chilled by the threat of prosecution.  In contrast, here, the private\nPlaintiffs do not claim any such direct injury; rather, they allege an injury that may or may not\ncome to pass, depending on, among other things, whether they are subsequently convicted of,\nand incarcerated for, some unspecified crime.  \n-16-",

In this action, the United States seeks to declare invalid and enjoin the enforcement of \ncertain provisions of Act No. 69, as enacted by the State of South Carolina on June 27, 2011, \nbecause such provisions are preempted by federal law and therefore violate the Supremacy \nClause of the United States Constitution. \n  2.  In our constitutional system, the federal government has preeminent authority to \nregulate immigration matters and to conduct foreign relations.  This authority derives from the \nConstitution and numerous acts of Congress.  The nation’s immigration laws reflect a careful and \nconsidered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian interests.  \nCongress has assigned to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Department of \nJustice, and the Department of State, along with other federal agencies, the enforcement and \nadministration of these immigration-related laws.  In administering these laws, the federal \nagencies balance the complex – and often competing – objectives that animate federal \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 2 of 26\nimmigration law and policy.  Although States may exercise their police power in a manner that \nhas an incidental or indirect effect on aliens, a State may not establish its own immigration \npolicy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration laws.  The \nConstitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of \ndisparate state and local immigration policies throughout the country. \n  3.  Despite the preeminent federal authority and responsibility over immigration and \nforeign relations, the State of South Carolina recently enacted Act No. 69, which addresses \nmultiple aspects of immigration regulation and enforcement and is scheduled to become effective \non January 1, 2012.  The provisions of Act No. 69, working individually and in concert, seek to \npunish unlawful entry and presence of aliens such as by requiring, whenever practicable, a deter-\nmination of immigration status during any lawful stop, detention, investigation, or arrest by the \npolice where there is “reasonable suspicion” that an individual is unlawfully present, and by \nestablishing new state criminal sanctions against unlawfully present aliens.  The mandate to \nenforce Act No. 69 is reinforced by a provision allowing a resident of any political subdivision \nof South Carolina to file suit against any such subdivision that enacts “any ordinance or policy \nthat intentionally limits or prohibits a law enforcement officer, local official, or local government \nemployee from seeking to enforce a state law with regard to immigration” (Section 1).  Any \npolitical subdivision held liable under this provision faces civil penalties between $1,000 and \n$5,000 “for each day that the enactment, action, policy, or practice remains or remained in \neffect.” \n    4.  Act No. 69 requires state and local officers and officials to take certain actions in \nrelation to aliens without regard to the objectives that Congress has established for the federal \nimmigration system.  This failure to abide by the interests animating federal immigration law \n2 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 3 of 26\nprovides sufficient reason that Act No. 69 is preempted.  But just as importantly, even where \nSouth Carolina appears to pursue a goal of the federal system, it does so in a way that disregards \nfederal priorities, thereby necessarily resulting in a disruption of federal enforcement and a \nburden on resources that focus on aliens who pose a threat to national security or public safety.   \n  5.  If allowed to go into effect, Act No. 69’s enforcement scheme will conflict with and \nundermine the federal government’s careful balance of immigration enforcement priorities and \nobjectives.  For example, it will impose significant and counterproductive burdens on the federal \nagencies charged with enforcing the national immigration scheme, diverting resources and \nattention from the dangerous aliens whom the federal government targets as its top enforcement \npriority.  It will cause the detention and harassment of authorized visitors, immigrants, and \ncitizens who do not have or carry identification documents specified by the statute, or who \notherwise will be swept within Act No. 69’s rigid approach of universal, undifferentiated \nenforcement.  It will conflict with longstanding federal law governing the registration and \nmovement of aliens.  It will undermine federal law and invade federal authority by imposing \npunitive sanctions for conduct that falls outside of the State’s police powers and that Congress \naffirmatively decided should not be subject to such sanctions.  And it will interfere with and \nundermine the federal government’s control over relations with foreign governments. \n  6.  The United States understands the State of South Carolina’s legitimate concerns about \nillegal immigration, and has undertaken significant efforts both to secure our nation’s borders \nand to address the problems created by unlawfully present aliens.  The federal government, \nmoreover, welcomes cooperative efforts by States and localities to aid in the enforcement of the \nnation’s immigration laws.  But the United States Constitution forbids South Carolina from \nsupplanting the federal government’s immigration regime with its own State-specific immigra-\n3 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 4 of 26\ntion policy – a policy that, in purpose and effect, interferes with the numerous interests the \nfederal government must balance when enforcing and administering the immigration laws and \ndisrupts the balance actually established by the federal government.  Accordingly, and as set \nforth below, Act No. 69 is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution \nand must be declared unconstitutional and enjoined. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  7.  This action arises under the Constitution of the United States, Article VI, Clause 2, \nand Article I, Section 8, and the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et \nseq.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and \nthe United States seeks remedies under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1651, 2201, and 2202. \n  8.  Venue lies in the District of South Carolina pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), and in \nthe Charleston Division pursuant to Local Civil Rule 3.01(A)(1).  Defendants are the State of \nSouth Carolina and the Governor of South Carolina, who resides in the State.  A substantial part \nof the events or omissions giving rise to the claims in this action occurred in South Carolina, and \nthe defendants do business in this Division relating to the events or omissions alleged herein. \nPARTIES \n  9.  The United States of America is the plaintiff in this action, suing on its own behalf, as \nwell as on behalf of the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”), and the Department of State. \n  10.  DHS is an executive department of the United States.  See Homeland Security Act, \nPub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).  DHS is responsible for the administration and \nenforcement of laws relating to immigration, as well as the investigation of immigration crimes \nand protection of the United States border against the illegal entry of aliens.  See 8 U.S.C. \n4 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 5 of 26\n§ 1103.  DHS is also responsible for providing citizenship and immigration services through U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services. \n  11.  DOJ is an executive department of the United States.  See Act to Establish the \nDepartment of Justice, ch. 150, 16 Stat. 162 (1870).  The Attorney General, as the head of DOJ, \nshares certain immigration-related responsibilities with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \nhe may, among his various immigration functions, order aliens removed from the United States \nand order the cancellation of removal.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1103, 1158, 1182, 1227, 1229a, \n1229b. \n  12.  The Department of State is an executive department of the United States.  See State \nDepartment Basic Authorities Act of 1956, Pub. L. No. 84-885, as amended; 22 U.S.C. §§ 2651 \net seq.  The Department of State manages the foreign affairs of the United States under the \ndirection of the President, and is partially responsible for administering certain aspects of the \nfederal immigration laws, including but not limited to the administration of visas. \n  13.  Defendant, the State of South Carolina, is a State of the United States that entered the \nUnion as the eighth State in 1788. \n  14.  Defendant, Governor Nikki R. Haley, is the Governor of South Carolina, and is being \nsued in her official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  Federal Authority and Law Governing Immigration and the Status of Aliens \n  15.  The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution mandates that “[t]his \nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . \nshall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to \nthe Contrary notwithstanding.”  U.S. Const., art.

The Constitution affords the federal government the power to “establish an uniform \nRule of Naturalization,” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 4, and to “regulate Commerce with foreign \nNations,” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  Further, the federal government has broad authority to \nestablish the terms and conditions for the entry and continued presence of aliens in the United \nStates, and to regulate the status of aliens within the boundaries of the United States. \n  17.  The Constitution affords the President of the United States the authority to “take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const., art. II, § 3.  Further, the President has \nbroad authority over foreign affairs.  The establishment and implementation of policies toward \nother countries are exclusively reserved for the federal government, and the treatment of \nimmigrants from other countries is inextricably tied up with foreign policy.  Immigration law, \npolicy, and enforcement priorities are affected by and impact U.S. foreign policy, and are \nthemselves the subject of diplomatic arrangements.  \n  18.  Congress has exercised its authority to make laws governing immigration and the \nstatus of aliens within the United States by enacting the various provisions of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act and other laws regulating immigration.  Through the INA, Congress set forth \nthe framework by which the federal government determines which aliens may be eligible to enter \nand reside in the United States, which aliens may be removed from the United States, the conse-\nquences of unlawful presence, the penalties on persons who violate the procedures established \nfor entry, the conditions of residence, and the employment of aliens, as well as the process by \nwhich certain aliens may ultimately become naturalized citizens of the United States.  See 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.  The INA also vests the executive branch with considerable discretion in \nenforcing the provisions of federal immigration laws, generally allowing federal agencies to \nultimately decide whether particular immigration remedies are appropriate in individual cases. \n6 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 7 of 26\n  19.  In exercising its significant enforcement discretion regarding aliens and immigration, \nthe federal government prioritizes for arrest, detention, prosecution, and removal those aliens \nwho pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety.  Consistent with these enforce-\nment priorities, the federal government targets aliens engaged in or suspected of terrorism or \nespionage; aliens convicted of crimes, with a particular emphasis on violent criminals, felons, \nand repeat offenders; certain gang members; aliens subject to outstanding criminal warrants; and \nfugitive aliens, especially those with criminal records. \n  20.  In crafting federal immigration law and policy, Congress has necessarily taken into \naccount multiple and often competing national interests.  Ensuring effective enforcement of the \nprovisions against illegal immigration and unlawful presence is a highly important interest, but it \nis not the singular goal of the federal immigration laws.  The laws also take into account other \nuniquely national interests, including facilitating trade and commerce; welcoming those foreign \nnationals who visit or immigrate lawfully and ensuring their fair and equitable treatment \nwherever they may reside; responding to humanitarian concerns at the global and individual \nlevels; and otherwise ensuring that the treatment of aliens present in our nation does not harm \nour foreign relations with the countries from which they come or jeopardize the treatment of U.S. \ncitizens abroad.  Because immigration control and management is “a field where flexibility and \nthe adaptation of the congressional policy to infinitely variable conditions constitute the essence \nof the program,” United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 543 (1950) (internal \ncitations omitted), Congress vested substantial discretion in the President and the administering \nfederal agencies to adjust the balance of these multiple interests as appropriate – both globally \nand in individual cases.   \n7 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 8 of 26\n  21.  Congress has tasked DHS and DOJ with overseeing significant portions of the \nUnited States’ immigration interests, and has provided each with specific powers to promote the \nvarious goals of the federal immigration scheme and to enforce the federal immigration authority \nunder the INA.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103.  The Department of State is also empowered by the INA to \nadminister aspects of the federal immigration laws, including visa programs.  See, e.g., id. \n§ 1104.  DHS may generally order an alien immediately removed where the alien either fails to \npresent the appropriate documentation or commits fraud at the time of the alien’s inspection.  \nDHS may also place an alien into removal proceedings, and may ultimately remove an alien who \nentered the United States unlawfully or violated the conditions of admission.  See id. §§ 1182, \n1225, 1227, 1228(b), 1229, 1229a, 1231.  DOJ may order an alien removed for any of several \nreasons, including if the alien has stayed in the United States longer than permitted or has \nengaged in certain unlawful conduct.  See id. §§ 1227, 1229a.  In addition to removal, the statute \nauthorizes DHS and DOJ to employ civil and criminal sanctions against an alien for immigration \nviolations, such as unlawful entry, failing to properly register with the federal government, and \ndocument fraud.  See, e.g., id. §§ 1325, 1306, 1324c.  However, in the exercise of discretion, the \nadministering agencies may decide not to apply a specific sanction and may, among other steps, \npermit the alien to depart the country voluntarily at his or her own expense and may even decide \nnot to pursue removal of the alien if deferred federal enforcement will serve some other goal of \nthe immigration system.  See id. § 1229c.  \n  22.  Under federal law, both DHS and DOJ may, for humanitarian or other reasons, \ndecline to exercise certain immigration sanctions or grant an otherwise unlawfully present or \nremovable alien an immigration benefit – and potentially adjust that alien’s immigration status – \nif the alien meets certain conditions.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (providing asylum eligibility for \n8 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 9 of 26\naliens who have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion, if removed); id. § 1254a (providing \ntemporary protected status for otherwise eligible nationals of a foreign state that the Secretary of \nHomeland Security has specially designated as undergoing armed conflict, a natural disaster, or \nother extraordinary circumstance); id. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(iii) (providing discretion to waive grounds \nfor deportability “for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in \nthe public interest” for aliens who are otherwise deportable for encouraging unlawful entry of an \nimmediate family member); id. § 1229b (granting the Attorney General discretion to cancel \nremoval for certain aliens).  DHS also has the authority to permit aliens, including those who \nwould be inadmissible, to temporarily enter the United States for “urgent humanitarian reasons” \nor “significant public benefit.”  Id. § 1182(d)(5).  DHS may also refrain from enforcement \nactions, in appropriate circumstances, against persons unlawfully present in the United States.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (discussing deferred action). \n  23.  In light of these statutory provisions, DHS and DOJ exercise discretion with respect \nto, among other things, whether to allow an unlawfully present alien to voluntarily depart, \nwhether to place an alien into removal proceedings, whether to impose criminal sanctions on an \nalien who has committed an immigration violation, whether to allow an unlawfully present alien \nto remain in the country without physical detention in certain circumstances, and whether to \ngrant an alien humanitarian or some other form of relief.  Decisions to forego removal or \ncriminal penalties result not only from resource constraints, but also from affirmative policy \nconsiderations – including humanitarian and foreign policy interests – established by Congress \nand balanced by the executive branch. \n9 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 10 of 26\n  24.  Congress, which holds exclusive authority for establishing alien status categories and \nthe consequences thereof and for setting the conditions of aliens’ entry and continued presence, \nhas affirmatively decided that unlawful presence – standing alone – should not subject an alien to \ncriminal penalties, incarceration, or other punitive measures, although unlawful presence may \nsubject the alien to the civil remedy of removal.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), 1227(a)(1)(B) \n& (C).  Unlawful presence becomes an element of a criminal offense, however, when an alien is \nfound in the United States after having been previously removed or after voluntarily departing \nfrom the United States while a removal order was pending.  See id. § 1326.  Further, unlawful \nentry into the United States is a criminal offense.  See id. § 1325.  Congress has specifically \nauthorized federal immigration officers to patrol the United States border, as well as to search \nvehicles and lands near the border, to prevent aliens from unlawfully entering the United States, \nand it has empowered those officers to arrest an alien who is seen attempting unlawful entry at \nthe border or who the officer has reason to believe has unlawfully entered the county and is \nlikely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.  See id. § 1357. \n  25.  Congress has also created a comprehensive alien registration system for monitoring \nthe entry and movement of aliens within the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1201, 1301-1306; \nsee also 8 C.F.R. Part 264 (regulations regarding “Registration and Fingerprinting of Aliens in \nthe United States”).  Under this federal alien registration system, aliens seeking to enter the \nUnited States, either permanently or temporarily (other than diplomatic and official visitors), \nmust be registered by the Department of State at the time of visa application.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1201(b), 1301, 1302.  Any alien who is age 14 or over, who has not otherwise been registered \nand fingerprinted under the INA, and who remains in the United States for 30 days or longer, \nmust apply to be registered and fingerprinted by DHS.  See id. § 1302(a).  The INA provides that \n10 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 11 of 26\nany alien who is required to apply for registration and willfully fails to do so may be fined and \nimprisoned not more than six months.  See id. § 1306(a); 18 U.S.C. § 3571.  Aliens are required \nto report their change of address to DHS within ten days of such change.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1305.   \n  26.  As part of this federal alien registration system, Congress further specified the \ncontent of the registration forms, see 8 U.S.C. § 1303, what special circumstances may require \ndeviation, id., and the confidential nature of registration information, see id. § 1304.  Aliens who \nare 18 years of age and older are required to carry in their possession their certificate of alien \nregistration or alien registration receipt card.  See id. § 1304(e).  The INA provides that any alien \nwho fails to comply with this requirement may be fined and imprisoned not more than 30 days.  \nSee id.; 18 U.S.C. § 3571.   \n  27.  However, there are several circumstances in which an alien would not be provided \nwith evidence of registration notwithstanding the government’s knowledge of the alien’s \npresence.  Federal law provides a variety of humanitarian options for aliens – including \nunlawfully present aliens – who have been victimized or fear persecution or violence, including \nbut not limited to asylum, special visas for victims of trafficking, and special visas for victims of \nviolent crime.  In order to qualify for such a program, an alien needs to apply and satisfy the \ncriteria required by the program.  During the pendency of the application process, an alien may \nnot have evidence of registration even though the federal government is aware of the alien’s \npresence, has decided against removing the alien, obviously has no interest in prosecuting the \nalien for a crime, and may even have affirmatively granted the alien authorization to work in the \nUnited States.  These humanitarian programs demonstrate that one aspect of federal immigration \npolicy is to assist and welcome such victims in the United States, notwithstanding possible \ntemporary unlawful presence.  It would therefore violate federal policy to prosecute or detain \n11 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 12 of 26\nthese types of aliens for lack of registration papers – which is often known to the federal govern-\nment and, for affirmative policy reasons, not used as the basis for a removal proceeding or \ncriminal prosecution.   \n  28.  Congress has further exercised its authority over the entry and movement of aliens by \ncriminalizing the smuggling of unlawful aliens into the country, as well as the facilitation of \nunlawful immigration within the nation’s borders.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1324.  Specifically, federal \nlaw prohibits the knowing attempt to bring an alien into the United States “at a place other than a \ndesignated port of entry or place other than as designated by the [Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity],” id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(i), and imposes criminal penalties on a person who, “knowing or \nin reckless disregard” of the fact that an alien has unlawfully entered or remained in the United \nStates, attempts to “transport or move” the alien within the United States “in furtherance of such \nviolation of law.”  Id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii).  These criminal sanctions are directed at the smuggler \nand are not meant to serve as a criminal sanction for the unlawfully present alien or for incidental \ntransportation.  Congress chose not to penalize an unlawfully present alien’s mere movement \nwithin the country or across state lines unless other factors are present, nor do the federal \nimmigration laws penalize the provision of transportation services in such situations.   \n  29.  Federal law also imposes criminal penalties on a person who, “conceals, harbors, or \nshields from detection,” an alien in “knowing or in reckless disregard” of the fact that the alien \nhas unlawfully entered or remained in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii).  Federal \nlaw does not, as a general matter, restrict the movement of aliens – whether lawfully or unlaw-\nfully present – between different States.  Federal law additionally exempts from certain of these \nprohibitions religious organizations which “encourage, invite, call, allow, or enable” an alien to \n12 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 13 of 26\nvolunteer as a minister or missionary, and which provide the alien with basic living expenses.  \nId. § 1324(a)(1)(C).   \n  30.  DHS is primarily charged with administering and enforcing the INA and other laws \nrelating to immigration, which it accomplishes mainly through its components, U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), and U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103.  DHS also receives state \nand local cooperation in its enforcement efforts.  See id. § 1357(g).  In addition, Congress \nprescribed by statute a number of ways in which States may assist the federal government in its \nenforcement of the immigration laws.  See, e.g., id. § 1103(a)(10) (authorizing DHS to empower \nstate or local law enforcement with immigration enforcement authority when an “actual or \nimminent mass influx of aliens . . . presents urgent circumstances requiring an immediate Federal \nresponse”); id. § 1357(g)(1) - (9) (authorizing DHS to enter into agreements to provide \nappropriately trained and supervised state and local officers with the authority to perform \nfunctions related to the investigation, apprehension, and detention of aliens); id. § 1252c \n(authorizing state and local law enforcement to arrest aliens who are unlawfully present in the \nUnited States and were previously removed after being convicted of a felony in the United \nStates). \n  31.  Through a variety of programs, DHS works cooperatively with States and localities \nto accomplish its mission to enforce the federal immigration laws.  ICE administers the Law \nEnforcement Support Center (“LESC”), which is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and \nserves as a national enforcement operations center by – among other responsibilities – promptly \nproviding immigration status and identity information to local, state, and federal law enforce-\nment agencies regarding aliens suspected of, arrested for, or convicted of criminal activity.  \n13 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 14 of 26\nFurther, ICE and CBP officers respond to requests from state and local law enforcement officers \non a variety of immigration matters, including assisting with translation, determining alienage, \nand evaluating immigration documentation.   \n  32.  The opportunity that federal law provides for cooperation by state and local officials \ndoes not mean, however, that States can enact their own immigration policies to rival the \nnational immigration policy; the formulation of immigration policy and the balancing of immi-\ngration enforcement priorities is a matter reserved for the federal government.  Such regulation \ndoes not fall within the States’ traditional police powers and remains the exclusive province of \nthe federal government. \n  South Carolina’s Act No. 69 \n  33.  On June 27, 2011, Governor Nikki R. Haley signed into law Act No. 69, which \ncontains several provisions designed to work together to discourage and deter the entry into and \npresence of unlawful aliens in South Carolina through a statute that regulates numerous aspects \nof these aliens’ lives.  Indeed, Governor Haley, in signing Act No. 69, said that one purpose of \nthe law is to “make sure” that unlawfully present aliens find “another State to go to.”  See \nGovernor Nikki Haley Signs Illegal Immigration Reform Bill (video recording), available at \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMZikpA3_8U (uploaded by “nikkihaley”).  \n  34.  Act No. 69 implements South Carolina’s stated immigration policy through a wide-\nranging immigration regime that regulates everything from the transportation and harboring of \naliens (Section 4), to the carrying of identification and the making or using of false identification \n(Sections 5, 6, and 15), to the verification of immigration status (Section 6), and other aspects of \nan alien’s presence in the United States.  Unlike federal law, for example, Act No. 69 criminal-\nizes an alien’s own actions in “allowing” oneself to be transported or in “concealing” or \n14 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 15 of 26\n“sheltering” oneself “with intent to” avoid apprehension or detection.  Act No. 69 further \nexpands the opportunities for South Carolina police to discover the commission of these various \ncrimes, and thus to push aliens toward incarceration, by enforcing a mandatory immigration \nstatus verification system.   \n  35.  By pursuing retribution and ignoring every other objective embodied in the federal \nimmigration system (including the federal government’s prioritization of the removal of criminal \naliens), Act No. 69 conflicts with and otherwise stands as an obstacle to Congress’s demand for \nsufficient flexibility in the enforcement of federal immigration law to accommodate the \ncompeting interests of immigration control, national security and public safety, humanitarian \nconcerns, and foreign relations – a balance implemented through the supervision and policies of \nthe President and other executive officers with the discretion to enforce federal immigration \nlaws.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.  South Carolina’s punitive scheme would further undermine \nfederal foreign policy, in that the federal government has – as a matter of reciprocal, bilateral \nunderstandings – established that unlawfully present foreign nationals (who have not committed \nsome other violation of law) should be removed without criminal sanction or other punitive \nmeasures and that the same treatment should be afforded to American nationals who are unlaw-\nfully present in other countries.  Act No. 69 would thus interfere with federal policy and preroga-\ntives in the enforcement of the U.S. immigration laws and the conduct of foreign affairs.  All of \nthese provisions are backed by a private right of action that ensures a policy of full enforcement \nby every political subdivision in the State (Section 1). \n  36.  Act No. 69 attempts to override federal policies and priorities in the area of \nimmigration enforcement and to directly regulate the conditions of an alien’s presence in the \nUnited States despite the fact that those subjects are federal domains.  South Carolina’s adoption \n15 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 16 of 26\nof a policy focused exclusively on punishing unlawful presence disrupts the national enforce-\nment regime set forth in the INA and reflected in federal immigration enforcement policy and \npractice, including the federal government’s prioritization of enforcement against criminal aliens.  \nThus, because Act No. 69 attempts to set state-specific immigration policy, it legislates in an area \nconstitutionally reserved to the federal government, conflicts with federal immigration laws and \npolicy, and impedes the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress, and is therefore preempted. \n  37.  Several other States have passed or are contemplating passing legislation similar to \nAct No. 69.  The development and implementation of various conflicting state immigration \nenforcement policies will result in further and significant damage to (1) U.S. foreign relations, \n(2) the United States’ ability to fairly and consistently enforce the federal immigration laws and \nprovide immigration-related humanitarian relief, and (3) the United States’ ability to exercise the \ndiscretion vested in the executive branch under the INA, and will result in a patchwork of differ-\ning requirements for unlawfully present aliens and therefore their non-uniform treatment across \nthe United States. \n  Section 4 of Act No. 69 \n38.  Section 4 of Act No. 69 establishes four criminal offenses related to the transpor-\ntation or harboring of “a person who has come to, entered, or remained in the United States in \nviolation of law” – two offenses involving aliens themselves and two involving persons who \ntransport or harbor them.  Under Section 4, it is unlawful for an unlawfully present alien, “with \nintent to further [his or her] unlawful entry into the United States or avoiding apprehension or \ndetection of the person’s unlawful immigration status,” either (1) “to allow [him- or herself] to \nbe transported, moved, or attempted to be transported within the State or to solicit or conspire to \n16 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 17 of 26\nbe transported or moved within the State” or (2) “to conceal, harbor, or shelter [him- or herself] \nfrom detection or to solicit or conspire to conceal, harbor, or shelter [him- or herself] from \ndetection . . . .”   \n39.  In relation to other persons, Section 4 makes it unlawful for a person, “knowingly or \nin reckless disregard” of the fact that someone is an unlawfully present alien and “with intent to \nfurther [the alien’s] unlawful entry into the United States or avoiding apprehension or detection \nof [the alien’s] unlawful immigration status,” either (1) “to transport, move, or attempt to \ntransport that person within the State or to solicit or conspire to transport or move that person \nwithin the State,” or (2) “to conceal, harbor, or shelter from detection or to solicit or conspire to \nconceal, harbor, or shelter from detection that person . . . .”   \n40.  All of these offenses are felonies, punishable by a fine up to $5,000 and/or impris-\nonment up to five years.  Section 4 sets forth certain explicit exceptions, including “[p]roviding \nhealth care treatment or services to a natural person” and certain programs, such as soup \nkitchens, that provide certain “in-kind services at the community level.”  S.C. Act No. 69 § 4 \n(amending S.C. Code § 16-9-460). \n41.  Congress already regulates numerous aspects of the movement of aliens, including \nimposing criminal sanctions on persons who unlawfully bring aliens into the United States, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1323; imposing criminal sanctions on persons who transport unlawfully present aliens \nin furtherance of their unlawful entry or presence and persons who conceal or harbor such aliens, \nid. § 1324(a); penalizing persons who assist certain inadmissible aliens to enter the country, id. \n§ 1327; and penalizing the importation of aliens for immoral purposes, id. § 1328.  In short, “it is \nthe business of the political branches of the Federal Government, rather than that of either the \nStates or the Federal Judiciary, to regulate the conditions of entry and residence of aliens.”  \n17 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 18 of 26\nMathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 84-85 (1976) (emphasis added).  Congress indicated what role it \nsaw for the States in this area when it expressly authorized “all . . . officers whose duty it is to \nenforce criminal laws” to make arrests for violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1324(c). \n42.  Moreover, unlike the federal statutes in this area, Section 4 sets forth separate \noffenses expressly directed at aliens, contrary to Congress’s decision not to criminalize transpor-\ntation and harboring activities on the part of aliens themselves.  Further, even aside from these \nand other textual differences, enforcement of Section 4 will be subject to state decisions regard-\ning prosecutorial discretion and statutory interpretation, which will undermine federal authority \nto establish immigration enforcement priorities and strategies.  Thus, Section 4 of Act No. 69 \nconflicts with and otherwise stands as an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of Congress \nin creating a comprehensive system of penalties for the transportation and harboring of \nunlawfully present aliens. \n  Sections 5, 6 (part), and 15 of Act No. 69 \n43.  Section 5 of Act No. 69 makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine up to $100 \nand/or imprisonment up to 30 days, “to fail to carry in the person’s personal possession any \ncertificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to the person pursuant to 8 \nU.S.C. Section 1304 while the person is in this State.”  S.C. Act No. 69 § 5 (adding S.C. Code \n§ 16-17-750). \n44.  Section 6 of Act No. 69, in part, makes it a criminal offense to display or possess a \nfalse picture identification “for the purpose of offering proof of the person’s lawful presence in \nthe United States.”  A first offense is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine up to $100 or \nimprisonment up to 30 days, and each subsequent offense is a felony punishable by a fine up to \n18 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 19 of 26\n$500 or imprisonment up to five years.  S.C. Act No. 69 § 6 (adding S.C. Code § 17-13-\n170(A)(2)). \n45.  Section 15 of Act No. 69 makes it a felony “to make, issue, or sell, or offer to make, \nissue, or sell, a false, fictitious, fraudulent, or counterfeit picture identification that is for use by \nan alien who is unlawfully present in the United States.”  Violation is punishable by a fine up to \n$25,000 and/or imprisonment up to five years.  S.C. Act No. 69 § 15 (adding S.C. Code § 16-13-\n480). \n46.  Congress has created an extensive scheme for monitoring the entry and movement of \naliens within the United States – that is, a comprehensive alien registration system.  Congress has \nspoken in very specific terms regarding which aliens must register, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1201, 1301, \nwhen they must register, id. § 1302, the content of the registration forms and what special \ncircumstances may require deviation, id. § 1303, the confidential nature of registration \ninformation, id. § 1304, the circumstances under which an alien must possess registration \ndocuments after registering and the consequences for failing to do so, id., the circumstances \nunder which a registered alien must report his movement to the government, id. § 1305, and the \npenalties for failing to register or to notify the government of a change in address, id. § 1306; see \nalso 8 C.F.R. pt. 264 (Registration and Fingerprinting of Aliens in the United States).  “[T]he \nfederal government, in the exercise of its superior authority in this field, has enacted a complete \nscheme of regulation and has therein provided a standard for the registration of aliens, [and] \nstates cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail or \ncomplement, the federal law, or enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.”  Hines v. \nDavidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 66-67 (1941); see United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d 339, 354-56 (9th \n19 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 20 of 26\nCir. 2011).  Accordingly, South Carolina’s attempt to enter this field by means of these \nprovisions in Act No. 69 is preempted. \n47.  Moreover, all three of these South Carolina provisions establish criminal penalties \nthat differ from those imposed by federal law and independent state mechanisms for \nenforcement, with likely prosecutorial decisions and judicial interpretations differing from those \nof federal authorities.  Although state authorities may enforce federal immigration laws in \ncooperation with federal authorities, they must adhere to federal priorities and federal court \ninterpretations in doing so; in contrast, South Carolina’s enforcement of its own immigration \nstatutes would not be so constrained, creating the potential for contradictory interpretations and \npriorities.  \n  Section 6 of Act No. 69 \n48.  Other portions of Section 6 of Act No. 69 provide that if a law enforcement officer, \nin making a stop or arrest or even an investigation “for a criminal offense . . . has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the person is unlawfully present in the United States, the officer shall \nmake a reasonable effort, when practicable, to determine whether the person is lawfully present \nin the United States, unless the determination would hinder or obstruct an investigation.”  The \nperson is presumed to be lawfully present if he or she provides a valid driver’s license or picture \nidentification issued by South Carolina or another State, a picture ID issued by the United States \n(including a passport or military identification), or a tribal picture identification.  In absence of \nsuch identification, the person “may” still be presumed to be lawfully present “if the officer is \nable to otherwise verify that the person has been issued any of those forms of picture \nidentification.”   \n20 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 21 of 26\n49.  If an individual does not meet the presumption set forth in Section 6, the officer \n“shall make a reasonable effort, when practicable, to verify the person’s lawful presence in the \nUnited States,” either by contacting the State Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit created by \nAct No. 69 (Section 17), by “submitting an Immigration Alien Query through the International \nJustice and Public Safety Network,” or by contacting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-\nment (“ICE”) within the Department of Homeland Security.  The effort to determine lawful \npresence may last for “a reasonable amount of time.” \n50.  The federal government is responsible for “determining what aliens shall be admitted \nto the United States” and their “registration, documentation [of registration], and possession of \n[the] proof thereof.”  See Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 11 (1982) (internal quotation marks \nomitted); United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d at 355-56; see also Hines, 312 U.S. at 66-67.  \nIdentifying, detaining, and removing unlawfully present aliens are among the functions of U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1226; 8 C.F.R. § 236.1.  The efforts of \nICE to identify, detain, and remove unlawfully present aliens are focused on – in this order – \n“[a]liens who pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety,” “[r]ecent illegal \nentrants,” and “[a]liens who are fugitives or otherwise obstruct immigration controls.”  See Civil \nImmigration Enforcement:  Priorities for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens \n(Mar. 2, 2011), available at http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1103/110302washingtondc.htm. \n51.  Nevertheless, Congress has set forth certain specific circumstances under which state \nand local law enforcement officers may assist the federal government in enforcing immigration \nlaws.  For example, under the heading “Performance of immigration officer functions by State \nofficers and employees,” an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision may, pursuant \nto a written agreement with the federal government, “perform a function of an immigration \n21 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 22 of 26\nofficer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  In doing so, however, “an officer or employee of a State or political \nsubdivision of a State shall be subject to the direction and supervision” of federal officials.  Id. \n§ 1357(g)(3).  Even without a written agreement, a state or local officer may “otherwise . . . \ncooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of \naliens not lawfully present in the United States.”  Id. § 1357(g)(10)(B) (emphasis added).  But \nany systematic efforts by state and local governments to identify, apprehend, and detain aliens \nmust be carried out in cooperation with the responsible federal officials, and “in a manner that \nmaintains the ability to conform to the policies and priorities of [the Department of Homeland \nSecurity] and that ensures that individual state and local officers are at all times in a position to \nbe – and, when requested, are in fact – responsive to the direction and guidance of federal \nofficials.”  See Guidance on State and Local Governments’ Assistance in Immigration \nEnforcement and Related Matters, available at http://www.dhs.gov/files/resources/guidance-\nstate-local-assistance-immigration-enforcement.shtm. \n52.  Accordingly, Section 6 of Act No. 69 is preempted in at least three respects.  First, \ngiven that Congress has clearly expressed its intent that state and local government officers may \nparticipate in identifying and apprehending unlawfully present aliens only in cooperation with \nfederal officials, a state law that systematically requires state and local officers to identify and \napprehend aliens contrary to that intent would be preempted.  Under the mandatory verification \nscheme set forth in Section 6, however, all law enforcement officers in South Carolina must \nattempt to determine the immigration status of every person who is stopped, detained, \ninvestigated, or arrested for any “criminal offense” when “reasonable suspicion” of unlawful \npresence exists.  The statute contains no provision for seeking or adhering to federal guidance \n22 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 23 of 26\nregarding when such a determination is necessary or what constitutes “reasonable suspicion,” \nand no acknowledgment of the federal government’s focus on aliens who pose a danger or risk to \npublic safety.  \n53.  Second, Section 6 will significantly increase the submission of immigration \nverification requests to the federal government by presumptively requiring a determination of \nimmigration status every time an officer “stops, detains, investigates, or arrests a person for a \ncriminal offense” and has “reasonable suspicion” of unlawful presence.  Indeed, Senator Larry \nMartin, a sponsor of the bill that became Act No. 69, said during a discussion of the bill in the \nSouth Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee that he “want[ed] the phones of the federal \ngovernment to ring off the hook” as a result of the immigration status verifications required by \nAct No. 69.  See Noelle Phillips, Ford: Mexicans needed to do work others reject, The State, \nFeb. 8, 2011, available at http://www.thestate.com/2011/02/08/1685334/tougher-immigration-\nproposal-goes.html.  Section 6 will require DHS to shift resources away from its chosen \npriorities, given both the sheer number of likely verification requests and the difficulty of \ndifferentiating between high and low priority requests.  South Carolina’s submission of verifica-\ntion requests for even minor offenses would make it more difficult for DHS to pay timely atten-\ntion to inquiries related to high-priority or time-sensitive enforcement targets – that is, those who \npose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety. \n54.  Third, one of the objectives of Congress in immigration enforcement is “to protect \nthe personal liberties of law-abiding aliens” – to protect them from “indiscriminate and repeated \ninterception and interrogation by public officials . . . to leave them free from the possibility of \ninquisitorial practices and police surveillance.”  Hines, 312 U.S. at 65-66, 74.  Section 6 of Act \nNo. 69, however, creates a significant risk of harassment of lawfully present aliens and even U.S. \n23 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 24 of 26\ncitizens.  In absence of appropriate federal coordination and supervision, “reasonable suspicion” \nsuch as to require an immigration check under Act No. 69 could be understood as arising from a \nperson’s inability to speak English well, a particular manner of dress, or even certain physical \ntraits – characteristics shared by unlawful aliens, lawful aliens, and citizens.  Further, many \ncategories of aliens may not have documentation indicating that their presence is lawful – such \nas citizens of countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program or persons who have applied \nfor asylum or temporary protected status, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1187, 1254a – thus giving rise to \n“reasonable suspicion” of unlawful presence and requiring further detention for a “reasonable \namount of time” while verification occurs.  Indeed, nothing would prevent multiple detentions of \nthe same lawfully present alien. \n  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION – VIOLATION OF THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE \n55.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 54 of the Complaint as if fully stated \nherein. \n  56.  Sections 4, 5, 6, and 15 of Act No. 69, taken in whole and in part, represent an \nimpermissible effort by South Carolina to establish its own immigration policy and to directly \nregulate the immigration status of aliens.  In particular, these sections conflict with federal law \nand foreign policy, disregard federal policies, interfere with federal enforcement priorities in \nareas committed to the discretion of plaintiff United States, and otherwise impede the \naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of federal law and foreign \npolicy. \n  57.  Sections 4, 5, 6, and 15 of Act No. 69 violate the Supremacy Clause, and are invalid. \n24 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 10/31/11    Entry Number 1     Page 25 of 26\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION – PREEMPTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW \n  58.

Gergel \n\nJudge, United States District Court \n\nP. O. Box 835 \n\nCharleston, SC 29402 \n\nDear Judge Gergel: \nYou have asked South Carolina's position regarding the proper interpretation of Sections \n6 and 7 of Act No. 69 of 2011, now codified at S.C. Code Arm. § 17-13-170 and 23-3-1100 \nrespectively.  It is our opinion that, consistent with the language of Section 6 itself, as well as the \nrequirement  that  the  Section  should,  if  possible,  be  interpreted  in  conformity  with  the \nConstitution, such Section must be construed to require that, once the purpose of a valid traffic \nstop has been fulfilled, the officer making the stop may not continue to detain the automobile and \noccupants thereof based upon the person's or persons' lawful presence in the United States (or \nsuspected lack thereot).  In other words, it is our opinion that Section 6, as properly interpreted \npursuant to well-recognized principles of statutory interpretation, does not permit officers to \nprolong the original stop based upon the officer's inquiry into or based on a determination, \nsuspicion,  or  admission  concerning  a  person's  immigration  status.  We  reach  a  similar \nconclusion that Section 7 does not authorize prolonging the detention of a person in jailor prison \nsimply to determine the person's immigration status.  Likewise, state law does not authorize state \nand local officials to arrest or maintain custody of an individual believed or determined to be \nunlawfully present for any purpose, even to transfer the individual to federal custody. \nLaw!A  nalysis \nSections 6 and 7 ofAct No. 69 of2011 \nSection 6 of Act No.  69 of 2011,  is codified at S.C.

A person who violates the provisions ofthis item: \n(a) for a first offense, is gUilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, must be \nfined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days; \nand \n(b) for a second offense or subsequent offenses, is guilty of a felony, and, upon \nconviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not \nmore than five years. \n(3) Ifthe person cannot provide the law enforcement officer with any of the forms \nof picture identification listed in this subsection, the person may stiH be presumed \nto be lawfully present in the United States, ifthe officer is able to otherwise verify \nthat the person has been issued any ofthose forms ofpicture identification. \n(4) If the person is operating a motor vehicle on a public highway of this State \nwithout a driver's license in violation of Section 56-1·20, the person may be \narrested pursuant to Section 56-1-440. \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 5 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M.

If, after making a reasonable effort, the officer \nis unable to verify the person's lawful presence in the United States by one of the \nmethods described in item (I), the officer may not further stop. detain, investigate, \nor arrest the person based solely on the person's lawful presence in the United \nStates. \n(3) If the officer verifies that the person is lawfully present in the United States, \nthe officer may not further stop. detain, investigate, or arrest the person based \nsolely on the person's lawful presence in the United States. \n(4) If the officer determines that the person is unlawfully present in the United \nStates, the officer shall determine in cooperation with the Illegal Immigration \nEnforcement Unit within the South Carolina Department of Public Safety or the \nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. as applicable, whether the \nofficer shall retain custody of the person for the underlying criminal offense for \nwhich the person was stopped, detained, investigated, or arrested, or whether the \nIllegal Immigration Enforcement Unit within the South Carolina Department of \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 6 of 16\nThe Honomble Richard M.

The officer is not required by this \nsection to retain  custody  of the  person  based  solely on  the  person's  lawful \npresence in the United States. The officer may securely transport the person to a \nfederal facility in this State or to any other point of transfer into federal custody \nthat  is  outside  of the  officer's jurisdiction.  The  officer  shall  obtain judicial \nauthorization before securely transporting a person to a point of transfer that is \noutside of this State. \n(D) Nothing in this section must be construed to require a law enforcement officer \nto stop, detain, investigate, arrest, or confine a person based solely on the person's \nlawful presence in the United States. A law enforcement officer may not attempt \nto make an independent judgment of a person's lawful presence in the United \nStates. A law enforcement officer may not consider race, color, or national origin \nin implementing this section, except to the extent permitted by the United States \nor South Carolina Constitution. This section must be implemented in a manner \nthat is consistent with federal laws regulating immigration, protecting the civil \nrights of all  persons, and respecting the privileges and  immunities of United \nStates citizens. \n(E) Except as provided by federal law, officers and agencies of this State and \npolitical  subdivisions  of this  State  may  not  be  prohibited  or restricted  from \nsending, receiving, or maintaining information related to the immigration status of \nany person or exchanging that information with other federal,  state,  or local \ngovernment entities for the following purposes: \n(1) determining eligibiJity for any public benefit, service, or license provided by \nthe federal government, this State, or a political subdivision of this State; \n(2) verifying any claim of residence or domicile, if determination of residence or \ndomicile is required under the laws ofthis State or a judicial order issued pursuant \nto a civil or criminal proceeding in this State; \n(3) determining whether an alien is in compliance with the federal registration \nlaws prescribed by Chapter 7, Title II of the federal Immigration and Nationality \nAct; or \n(4) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Section 1373 and 8 U.S.C. Section 1644. \n(F) Nothing in this section must be construed to deny a person bond or from being \nreleased from confinement when such person is otherwise eligible for release. \nHowever, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17-15-30, a court setting bond \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 7 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M.

This information may be gathered and transmitted electronically under \nthe supervision of the Department of Public Safety, which shall develop and \nmaintain a database storing the information collected. The Department of Public \nSafety must promulgate regulations with regard to the collection and submission \nof the information gathered. In addition. the Department of Public Safety shall \nprepare  a  report to be posted on the  Department of Public Safety's  website \nregarding  motor  vehicle  stops  using  the  collected  information.  The  General \nAssembly shall have the authority to withhold any state funds or federal pass­\nthrough funds from any state or local law enforcement agency that fails to comply \nwith the requirements of this subsection. \nSection 7 of Act No. 69. codified as § 23-3-1100. further provides in relevant part: \n§ 23-3-1100. Determination of lawfulness of prisoner's presence in United \nStates;  notification  of Department  of Homeland  Security  of presence  of \nunlawful alien; housing and maintenance expenses; transportation. \n(A) Ifa person is charged with a criminal offense and is confined for any \nperiod in a jail of the State. county. or municipality, or a jail operated by a \nregional jail authority. a reasonable effort shall be made to determine whether the \nconfined person is an alien unlawfully present in the United States. \n(B) Ifthe prisoner is an alien, the keeper of the jailor other officer must \nmake  a  reasonable  effort  to  verify  whether  the  prisoner  has  been  lawfully \nadmitted to the United States or if the prisoner is unlawfully present in the United \nStates. Verification must be made within seventy-two hours through a query to \nthe Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) of the United States Department of \nHomeland Security or other office or agency designated for that purpose by the \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 8 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M.

If the prisoner is determined to \nbe an alien unlawfully present in the United States, the keeper of the jailor other \nofficer shall notify the United States Department of Homeland Security. \n(C)  Upon  notification  to  the  United  States  Department of Homeland \nSecurity pursuant to subsection (B), the keeper of the jail must account for daily \nexpenses incurred for the housing, maintenance, transportation, and care of the \nprisoner who is an alien unlawfully present in the United States and must forward \nan invoice to the Department of Homeland Security for these expenses. \n(D) The keeper of the jailor other officer may securely transport the \nprisoner who  is an alien unlawfully present in the United States to a  federal \nfacility in this State or to any other point of transfer into federal custody that is \noutside of the keeper of the jailor other officer's jurisdiction. The keeper of the \njailor other officer shall obtain judicial authorization before securely transporting \na prisoner who is unlawfully present in the United States to a point oftransfer that \nis outside ofthis State. \n(E) If a prisoner who is an alien unlawfully present in the United States \ncompletes the prisoner's sentence of incarceration, the keeper of the jailor other \nofficer shall notify the United States Department of Homeland Security and shall \nsecurely transport the prisoner to a federal facility in this State or to any other \npoint of transfer into federal custody that is outside of the keeper of the jailor \nother officer's jurisdiction. The keeper of the jailor other officer shall obtain \njudicial authorization before securely transporting a prisoner who is unlawfully \npresent in the United States to a point oftransfer that is outside ofthis State. \n(F) Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny a person bond or \nfrom being released from confinement when such person is otherwise eligible for \nrelease. However, pursuant to the provisions of Section 17-15-30, a court setting \nbond shall consider whether the person charged is an alien unlawfully present in \nthe United States. \n(0) The State Law Enforcement Division shall promulgate regulations to \ncomply with the provisions of this section in accordance with the provisions of \nChapter 23, Title 1. \n(H) In enforcing the terms of this section, no state officer shall attempt to \nmake an independent judgment of an alien's immigration status. State officials \nmust verify an alien's status with the federal government in accordance with 8 \nU.S.C.

Gergel \nPage 7 \nMarch 3, 2014 \nIn  construing  Sections  6  and  7,  as  codified,  a  number  of principles  of statutory \nconstruction are applicable.  \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and \neffectuate the intent of the legislature.\"  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 86, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 \n(2000).  \"[Courts] will give words their plain and ordinary meaning, and will not resort to a \nsubtle or forced construction that would limit or expand the statute's operation.\"  Harris  v. \nAnderson County Sheriff's Office, 381 S.C. 357,362,673 S.E.2d 423,425 (2009).  Statutes must \nbe read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory scheme must be \nconstrued together and each one given effect, if reasonable.  Stale v. Thomas, 372 S.C. 466, 468, \n642 S.E.2d 724, 725 (2007).  Moreover, a statute must, if possible, be construed consistently \nwith the Constitution.  State v.  Peake, 353 S.C. 499, 579 S.E.2d 297 (2003).  As our Supreme \nCourt has consistently recognized, \"[a]  possible constitutional construction of a statute must \nprevail over an unconstitutional interpretation ....\"  State v.  192 Coin-Operated Video Game \nMachines, 338 S.C. 176, 196,525 S.E.2d 872, 873 (2000). \nFourth Amendment Baekground \nBefore addressing Sections 6 and 7 specifically, it is also helpful to provide some general \nbackground  regarding  the  requirements  of the  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States \nConstitution  in  the  context  of investigative  stops  and  seizures.  The  Fourth  Amendment \nguarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures .... \" U.S. Const., Amend.  IV. We have previously \nadvised that these constitutional guarantees apply both to citizens of the United States, as well as \nto undocumented immigrants. Op. S.c. Alty. Gen.,  May 26, 2010 (2010 WL 2320807) [citing \nPlyler v.  Doe, 457 U.S.  202 (1982)]. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, including seizures that involve only a brief detention. Slate v.  Pichardo, \n367 S.C.  84, 623  S.E.2d 840, 847 [citing  United Stales  v.  Mendenhall,  446 U.S.  544, 551 \n(1980)J. The temporary detention during an automobile stop, even if only for a brief and limited \npurpose, constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Pichardo, 623 S.E.2d at 847 [citing \nWhren  v.  United Slates, 517 U.S.  806, 809-10 (1996)]. Generally, the decision to conduct a \ntraffic stop is reasonable when the police have probable cause to believe a traffic violation has \noccurred. Id., 517 U.S. at 810.  See also, Slate v. Provet, 405 S.C. 101,108,747 S.E.2d 453, 457 \n(2013) [\"Violation of motor vehicle codes provides an officer reasonable suspicion to initiate a \ntraffic stop.\"]  The principles articulated by the Supreme Court in Terry v.  OhiO, 392 U.S. 1,20 \n(1968), holding that a law enforcement officer may conduct an investigation \"reasonably related \nin scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\"  generally govern \nsuch stops. \nFurther, upon making a valid traffic stop, an officer's actions must be \"reasonably related \nin scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\" Terry, 392 U.S. \nat 20. The detention \"must be temporary and last no longer than necessary to effectuate the \npurpose of the stop.\" Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500 (1983); see also, Slate v. Morris, 395 \nS.C.  600,  720 S.E.2d 468  (Ct.  App.  2011).  Moreover,  the officer should  employ the least \nintrusive means reasonably available to investigate his or her suspicions in a short period oftime. \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 10 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M. Gergel \nPageS \nMarch 3, 2014 \nRoyer, 460 U.S. at 500. With regard to duration ofthe stop, although the reasonable duration of a \ntraffic stop \"cannot be stated with mathematical precision,\" Branch, 537 F.3d at 336, a stop may \nbecome unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably necessary to effectuate the stop. \nThe proper inquiry is whether, during the detention, the police diligently pursued a means of \ninvestigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it \nwas necessary to detain the individual(s). United Siaies v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675 (1985); State v. \nWoodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 544 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 2001). If the time, manner or scope of the \ninvestigation  exceeds  the  proper  parameters,  a  constitutionally  permissible  stop  may  be \ntransformed into one which violates the Fourth Amendment. ld. \nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has also recently summarized the permissibility of a \ntraffic stop as follows: \n[a]lthough the scope and duration components of Terry's second prong \nrequire  highly  fact-specific  inquiries,  the  cases  make  possible  some \ngeneralizations. When a police officer lawfully detains a vehicle, \"police \ndiligence involves requesting a driver's license and vehicle registration, \nrunning  a  computer  check,  and  issuing  a  ticket.\"  United  States  v. \nDigiovanni, 650 F.3d 498,507 (41b Cir. 2011). The officer may also, \"in \nthe interest of personal safety,\" request that the passengers in the vehicle \nprovide identification, at least so long as the request does not prolong the \nseizure. United States v. Soriano-Jarquin, 492 F.3d 495,500-01 (41b Cir. \n2007). Similarly, the officer may \"inquir[e] into matters unrelated to the \njustification for the traffic stop,\" Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 333, \n129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009), and may take other actions that \ndo  not  constitute  \"searches\"  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fourth \nAmendment, such as conducting a dog-sniff of the vehicle, [Rllnois v.l \nCaballes, 543 U.S. [405,] 409 [2005], but again only \"so long as those \ninquiries [or other actions] do not measurably extend the duration of the \nstop.\" Johnson, 129 S.Ct. at 788. \nUnited States v. Guljon-Ortiz, 660 F.3d 757, 764-65 (41b Cir. 2011). \nOnce the officer has completed the original purpose of the stop, the traffic stop should \ncome to an end.  Moreover,  when  the  unrelated questions demonstrate  that the  officer has \n\"definitely abandoned the prosecution of the traffic stop and embarked on another sustained \ncourse of investigation or where the unrelated questions constitute the bulk of the interaction \nbetween the police officer and the defendant, they unreasonably extend the scope and duration of \nthe stop.\"  Digiovanni, 650 F.3d at 508-09. In other words, if an individual is detained incident to \na traffic stop, \"when the purpose justifYing the stop is exceeded, the detention becomes illegal \nunless a reasonable suspicion of some other crime exists.\"  United States v. Jackson, 280 F.3d \n403,405 (4th Circuit 1998). \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 11 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M. Gergel \nPage 9 \nMarch 3, 2014 \nAgain, courts emphasize that the intrusiveness and duration of the stop must bear a \nreasonable relation to either the underlying traffic offense or other circumstances suggesting \ncriminal activity that come lawfully to the officer's attention during the stop. Slale v.  Pichardo, \n367 S.C., supra at 98, 623 S.E.2d, supra at 848 [once the purpose of the traffic stop has been \ncompleted, an officer can lengthen  the stop. or expand  the scope of the  stop. only  with a \nreasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity needed to justify further detention]. See also \nlllinois v.  Cabal/es, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005) [\"... a seizure that is lawful at its inception can \nviolate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of execution unreasonably infringes upon interests \nprotected by the Constitution.\"].  Nonnally, an extension is pennitted only if (1) the encounter \nbecomes consensual or (2) the officer has at least a reasonable, articulable suspicion of other \ncriminal activity. Siale v. Morris, 395 S.C. 600, 720 S.E.2d 468, 471 (Ct. App. 2011); Pichardo, \n623  S.E.2d at 848. The officer's suspicion. of course,  must be  based upon \"particularized, \nobjective  facts  which,  taken  together  with  rational  inferences  from  those  facts,  reasonably \nwarrant suspicion that a crime is being committed.  In detennining whether reasonable suspicion \nn \nexists, the Court must consider the totality of the circumstances. In doing so, the court may \nconsider any added meaning that certain conduct might suggest to experienced law enforcement \nofficers in the field, trained in the observation of criminal activity. United Slales v.  Corlez, 449 \nU.S. 411,417 (1981). \nArizona v. United States \nWith this general summary of Fourth Amendment case law in the context ofinvestigative \nstops in mind, we turn now to the application of these principles to immigration enforcement by \nstate and local officers in light of the Supreme Court's seminal decision in Arizona v.  Uniled \nSiales, _  U.S. -' 132 S.Ct. 2492, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012), (hereinafter \"Arizona\").  There, \nthe Court addressed a provision similar to § 17-13-170 (Section 6 of Act No. 690f2011).  The \nCourt declined to enjoin that Arizona provision, recognizing that the law was subject to two \npossible interpretations, one of which could be read as not subjecting the statute to federal \npreemption.  According to  the  Supreme  Court,  \"[a]t this stage,  without  the  benefit  of the \ndefinitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume [the provision] \nwill be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.\"  132 S.Ct. at 2510.  However, \nwhile Arizona did not directly decide the  issue, the Supreme Court noted  that \"[d]etaining \nindividuals  solely  to  verify  their  immigration  status  would  raise  constitutional  concerns.\" \nArizona,  132 S.Ct. at 2509.  Referencing Arizona v.  Johnson,  supra and Illinois v.  Cabal/es, \nsupra, the Supreme Court in Arizona quoted Caballes with approval that \"[a] seizure that is \njustified solely by the interest of issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it \nis prolonged  beyond  the time  reasonably required to  complete that  mission.\"  ld., quoting \nCabel/es, 543 U.S. at 407.  Moreover, in the Supreme Court's view, \"it would disrupt the federal \nframework [regarding immigration policies] to put state officers in the position of holding aliens \nin  custody  for  possible  unlawful  presence without  federal  direction  and  supervision.\"  ld. \nHowever, according to the Court, ifthe Arizona provision \"oruy requires state officers to conduct \na status check during the course of an organized, lawful detention ... (,)\" then \"the provision \nlikely would survive preemption - at least absent some showing that it has other consequences \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 12 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M. Gergel \nPage 10 \nMarch 3, 2014 \nthat  are  adverse  to  federal  law  and  its objectives.\"  fd.  Thus,  Arizona,  cognizant  of the \nconstitutional concerns regarding prolonged detention, noted that \"the state courts may conclude \nthat, unless the person continues to be suspected ofsome crime for which he may be detained by \nstate officers, it would not be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration inquiry.\"  Id. \n(emphasis added). \nSantos Case (4th Circuit) \nFollowing  the Arizona decision  by  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Fourth  Circuit  recently \naddressed the nature of an immigration status inquiry in Santos v.  Frederick County Bd.  of \nCom'rs., 725 F.3d 451  (4th Cir. 2013).  There, the Court dealt with the issue of whether, once \nthere was a \"seizure\" pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, deputies could then further detain and \nultimately arrest an individual based upon the existence of a civil ICE removal warrant.  The \nFourth Circuit noted that state officers could assist \"federal immigration efforts under 8 U.S.C. § \n1357 (g)(1), which authorizes the Attorney General to enter into agreements with local law \nenforcement  agencies  that  allow specific  local  officers  to  perform  the  functions  of federal \nimmigration officers.\"  725 F.3d at 463464, citing Arizona v.  United States,  132 S.Ct. at 2506. \nFurther, the Court proceeded to explain that other provisions of federal law allow state or local \nofficers to assist in federal immigration enforcement: \nEven in the absence of a written agreement, local law enforcement agencies may \n\"cooperate  with  the  Attorney  General  in  the  identification,  apprehension, \ndetention,  or  removal  of  aliens  not  lawfully  present  in  the  United \nStates.\"  § 1357 (g)(lO){B).  When enforcing federal immigration law pursuant to \nSection 1357{g) local law officers are \"subject to the direction and supervision of \nthe Attorney General.\"  § 1357 (g){3). \nOther statutory provisions authorize  local  law enforcement  officers to \nengage in immigration enforcement in more circumscribed situations.  See, e.g. § \n11 03 (a)(lO) (allowing the Attorney General to authorize local law enforcement \nofficers  to  assist  in  immigration  enforcement  in  the  event  of an  'actual  or \nimminent mass influx of aliens arriving off the coast of the United States\"); § \n1252 c(a) (authorizing local law enforcement officers to arrest illegally present \naliens who have \"previously been convicted of a felony in the United States and \ndeported or left the United States after such conviction); § 1324 (c) (allowing \nlocal law enforcement officers to arrest individuals for bringing in and harboring \ncertain aliens). \nId. at 464. \nThe Fourth Circuit, in Sanlos, quoting Arizona\"  noted that\" '[a]s a general rule, it is not \na crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States ....' \" 725 F.3d at 464, \nquoting Arizona, 132 S.Ct. at 2505.  Thus, as Sanlos recognized, the Supreme Court in Arizona \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 13 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M. Gergel \nPage 11 \nMarch 3, 2014 \nconcluded that\" '[i]fthe police stop someone based on nothing more than possible removability, \nthe usual predicate for arrest is absent.'\"  Santos,  Id.  Thus, as the Fourth Circuit correctly \npointed out, Arizona held unconstitutional a provision that authorized a state officer to \" 'without \na warrant ... arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe ... [the person]  has \ncommitted any public offense that makes [him] removable from the United States.' \"  Santos,Id. \nquoting Arizona, Id (which quoted Ariz.Rev.Stat Ann. § 13-3883(A)(5».  In the view of the \nSupreme Court in Arizona such a provision \"attempts to provide state officers even greater \nauthority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible removability than Congress has given to trained \nfederal immigration officers.\"  Arizona, 132 S.Ct. at 2506.  Thus, according to Santos, Arizona \nwas dispositive of this question: \nLower federal courts have universally-and we think correctly-interpreted \nArizona  v.  United States  as  precluding  local  law  enforcement  officers  from \narresting  individuals  solely  based  on  known  or suspected  civil  immigration \nviolations.  See  Melendres  v.  Arpaio,  695  F.3d  990,  1001  (9th  Cir.2012); \nMelendres v. Arpaio, No. PHX-CV-07-02513-GMS, 2013 WL 2297173, at *60­\n63 (D.Ariz. May 24; 2013); Buquer v. City o/Indianapolis, No. 1:11-cv-00708­\nSEB, 2013 WL 1332158, at *10-11 (S.D.Ind. Mar. 28, 2013). \n725 F.3d at 464-465.  As the Santos Court reasoned: \nA law enforcement officer may arrest a suspect only if the officer has \" \n'probable cause'  to  believe that the suspect is  involved  in criminal  activity.\" \nBrown v.  Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 51, 99 S.Ct. 2637,61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979). Because \ncivil immigration violations do not constitute crimes, suspicion or knowledge that \nan individual has committed a civil immigration violation, by itself, does not give \na law enforcement officer probable cause to believe that the individual is engaged \nin criminal activity. Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1000-0 I. Additionally, allowing local \nlaw enforcement officers to arrest individuals for civil immigration violations \nwould infringe on the substantial discretion Congress entrusted to the Attorney \nGeneral in making removability decisions, which often require the weighing of \ncomplex  diplomatic,  political,  and  economic  considerations.  See  Arizona  v. \ns.a. \nUnited States,  132  at 2506-07 .... Nonetheless, the Court's logic regarding \narrests readily extends to brief investigatory detentions. In particular, to justify an \ninvestigatory  detention,  a  law  enforcement  officer  must  have  reasonable, \narticulable suspicion that \"criminal activity may be afoot.\" Terry, 392 U.S. at 30, \n88 S.Ct. 1868. And because civil immigration violations are not criminal offenses, \nsuspicion or knowledge that an individual  has committed a civil  immigration \nviolation \"alone does not give rise to an inference that criminal activity is 'afoot.' \n.. Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1001. \nTherefore,  we  hold  that,  absent  express  direction  or authorization  by \nfederal statute or federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 14 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M. Gergel \nPage 12 \nMarch 3,2014 \nnot  detain  or arrest  an  individual  solely  based  on known  or  suspected  civil \nviolations of federal immigration law. \nLike the district court, we conclude that the deputies seized Santos for \npurposes of the Fourth Amendment when Deputy Openshaw gestured for her to \nstay seated after dispatch infonned him of the outstanding civil ICE deportation \nwarrant. See supra Part III.C. At that time, the deputies' only basis for detaining \nSantos was the civil ICE warrant. Yet as the defendants concede, the deputies \nwere not authorized to engage in immigration law enforcement under the Sherifi's \nOffice's Section  1357{g){1)  agreement with the Attomey General.  They  thus \nlacked authority to enforce civil immigration law and violated Santos's rights \nunder the Fourth Amendment when they seized her solely on the basis of the \noutstanding civil ICE warrant. \nId., at 464-465 (emphasis added).  Thus, in Santos the Fourth Circuit concluded that \" ... the \ndeputies violated Santos' rights under the Fourth Amendment when they seized her after learning \nthat she was the subject of a civil immigration warrant and absent ICE's express authorization or \ndirection.\" Id. at 469. \nConclusion \nIn Arizona v.  United States,  supra,  the United  States Supreme Court addressed  the \nvalidity of a provision similar to Section 6 of Act No. 69 of 2011, now codified at § 17~13-170. \nThe Court declined to enjoin that provision, recognizing that the law was subject to two possible \ninterpretations, one of which could be read as not subjecting the Arizona statutory provision at \nissue to federal preemption.  While the Supreme Court cautioned that \"[d]etaining individuals \nsolely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns,\" the Court further \nobserved that such \"constitutional concerns\" could be avoided if statutes similar to §17~13-170 \nare construed so that \"unless the person [stopped and detained for a valid reason other than \nimmigration status] continues to be suspected of some crime for which he may be detained by \nstate officers, it would not be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration inquiry.\" \nArizona, 132 S.Ct. at 2509.  According to the Arizona Court, ifthe provision \"only requires state \nofficers to conduct a status check during the course ofan organized lawful detention or after a \ndetainee has been released, the provision likely would survive preemption - at least absent some \nshowing that it has other consequences that are adverse to federal law and its objectives.\"  Id. \n(emphasis added).  Moreover, in Santos, the Fourth Circuit also recently held that \"local officers \nlack authority to arrest individuals suspected of civil immigration violations.\"  725 F.3d supra at \n464. \nIt is our opinion that a court is likely to interpret § 17~13-170 (Section 6 of Act No. 69 of \n2011) in the manner which Arizona recognized necessary to ensure avoidance of preemption \nconcerns.  The express language of § 17-13~170 (A) specifies that \"during the commission of a \nvalid stop\" [such as for a traffic offense], an officer, upon \"reasonable suspicion,\" must \"make a \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 15 of 16\nThe Honorable Richard M. Gergel \nPage 13 \nMarch 3, 2014 \nreasonable effort, when practicable, to detennine whether the person [suspected of a criminal \noffense] is lawfully present in the United States ....,,1  Based upon the legislature's use of the \nlanguage \"during the commission of a valid stop\" - indicating that the immigration inquiry must \noccur while the investigation ofthe original stop is ongoing, but not afterwards - in other words, \nwe  believe the  General  Assembly  intended  that  individuals  may  not be  stopped,  detained, \narrested  or  have  their  detention  prolonged  based  upon  their  immigration  status,  and  any \nimmigration inquiry may not be initiated after the stop has ended. \nIn our opinion, this means that even if a state or local officer is able to verify that an \nindividual is present in violation of federal immigration laws, § 17-13-170 does not authorize the \nofficer to make an arrest or continue to detain the individual on that basis.  Section 17-13-170 \n(C){4) emphasizes that even \"[i]fthe officer determines that the person is unlawfully present in \nthe United States ... ,\" the officer \"is not required by this section to retain custody of the person \nbased solely on the person's lawful presence in the United States.\"  Such a limitation is the \noverriding premise throughout the statute - i.e. a person may not be held or detained based upon \nhis or her immigration status. \nThus, if an officer stops, detains or arrests a person for a valid non-immigration reason \n[e.g. reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that the individual has violated a state \ncriminal law], during that time, the officer may ask the person questions related to his or her \nimmigration  status  and  may  even  communicate  with  the  authorities  (including  federal \nauthorities), specified  in  §  17-13-170, to  inquire further  regarding such immigration status. \nHowever, such questioning and inquiry regarding the person's or persons' immigration status \nmay not prolong the original detention,  even if the inquiry as to immigration status is still \npending.  Thus, once the original justification for the stop has been addressed, the individual \nmust be released unless there is additional reasonable suspicion of a separate crime that would \njustify further detention.  As stated, the express language used in § 17-13-170 (A) \"during the \ncommission of the stop\" means that any prolonged detention in order to make or further an \nimmigration inquiry is not authorized.  Accordingly, the General Assembly clearly anticipated \nthat § 17-13-170 must confonn to federal immigration law.  See, § 17-13-170 (D). \nLikewise, § 23-3-1100 does not authorize prolonging the detention of a person in jailor \nprison simply to detennine the person's immigration status.  As § 23-3-1100 (F) expressly states, \nnothing in the Section \"shall be construed to deny a person bond or from being released from \nconfinement when such person is otherwise eligible for release.\"  While § 23-3-1100 (E) might \nsuggest otherwise, the literal language of § 23-3-1100 (F) is clear that additional confinement or \nI It is important to note that the literal text of Section 6 requires that an investigation conducted \npursuant thereto applies only to the person suspected of a criminal offense, and not to other \nindividuals who may be present but are not suspected of any criminal activity.  For example, \nofficers may question a vehicle passenger about his or her immigration status pursuant to Section \n6 only when that individual is also suspected of a criminal offense, even if the officer has \nreasonable suspicion that the individual may also be present without authorization. \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 03/04/14    Entry Number 153     Page 16 of 16\nThe llonorable Richard M. Gergel \nPage 14 \nMarch 3,2014 \ndetention of an individuaL based upon one's immigration status, is not authorized.:!  In short, § \n23-3-1100 docs not authorize a state or local law enforcement officer to transfer an individual \nsuspected of being unlawfully present, and who has completed his or her sentence, to a federal \nfacility, as this would constitute a prolonging of the person's detention based upon immigration \nstatus. \nMoreover, we do not believe the Legislature. in enacting Sections 6 and 7 of Act No. 69 \nof 2011, sanctioned such prolonged detention of those suspected of illegal presence even in the \nnarrow circumstances of a suspected  federal  criminal  violation or at  of the  request  of ICE. \nAgain,  the  words  \"during  the  commission  of the  stop,\"  as  we  read  them,  particularly  in \nconjunction with the requirement of § 17-13-170 (D) - that any stop must  be consistent with \nfederal immigration law and the United States Constitution - mandates that any detention not be \nprolonged based solely upon one's immigration status.  Thus, as § 17-13-170 expressly directs, \nany inquiry concerning a person's or persons' immigration status must be conducted \"during the \ncommission of the [original] stop\" and not beyond that lime and circumstance.

These actions arise out of legislation adopted by \nthe South Carolina General Assembly on June 27, 2011 (hereafter referred to as \"Act 69\" or \"the \nAct\").  Act 69 attempts to address a broad range of immigration related issues through, inter alia, \nthe adoption of various state criminal provisions, employer sanctions and mandates to local law \n1 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 2 of 42\nenforcement regarding the identification and apprehension of persons unlawfully present in the \nUnited States.  Plaintiffs in the two separate actions assert similar, but not identical, \nconstitutional challenges to various sections of Act 69 and seek to preliminarily enjoin the \nimplementation of portions of the challenged state statute, which will otherwise become effective \non January 1, 2012.  All parties to this action have submitted extensive briefs relating to the \npending motions for preliminary injunction, and the Court heard several hours of oral argument \non December 19, 2011.  The Court addresses these motions below. \nFactual Background \nThe South Carolina General Assembly took up the matter of state immigration legislation \nin the 2011 legislative session because of a perceived failure of the United States to \"secure our \n1 \nsouthern border,\" which \"really jeopardize[s] our national security.\"  (Dkt. No. 29-25 at 13).\nThe Act was designed to deal with \"issues regarding folks being in South Carolina unlawfully \n[and] not having proper identification.\" (!d. at 2).  The South Carolina Senate conducted four \npublic hearings across the State in the fall of 2010 regarding local problems with unlawful \nimmigration.  (!d.) \nIn the course oflegislative debate, legislators acknowledged that the proposed legislation \nmight be subject to legal challenge.  One of the Senate sponsors of the bill stated during floor \ndebate that \"we get real close to the line in some respects,\" and a supporter stated, \"since there is \na severability clause, I want to go ahead and be as muscular and push as hard as we can in terms \nof what our state rights are.\"  (Dkt. No. 29-25 at 11; Dkt. No. 29-26 at 24).  Another senator, \n1 In this Order, all references to docket entries refer to entries in the case brought by the private \nplaintiffs, Civil Action No.2: 11-2779, except for the references to docket entry 16, which are \nreferences to the United States' motion for preliminary injunction and its attachments in the case \nbrought by the United States, Civil Action No. 2:11-2958, and the reference to docket entry 43, \nwhich is a reference to the defendants' response to the United States' motion for preliminary \ninjunction in Civil Action No. 2:11-2958. \n2 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 3 of 42\nwho opposed the legislation, stated during floor debate that the bill was \"clearly \nunconstitutional\" and would \"subject[] this state government to attorneys' fees.\"  (Dkt. No. 29-\n26 at 37-38). \nOne of the bill's sponsors acknowledged during Senate floor debate that the State had the \noption of entering into a written agreement with the federal government regarding immigration \nenforcement (known as \"287(g) agreements\") and that \"it would be much better\" if an agreement \n\"had been entered into between the ChiefofSLED2 and the federal government.\"  (Dkt. No. 29-\n25 at 14).  Rather than attempting to enter into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government \nas expressly authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(l), \nthe State elected to go forward with its own immigration bill, which included state criminal \nsanctions, because it was \"really important\" to have State \"control.\"  (Dkt. No. 29-25 at 14). \nSupporters of the bill voiced the hope that the Act would encourage persons unlawfully present \nin South Carolina to find \"a different state to go to.\"  (Dkt. No. 16-1 at 4 & n.l; Dkt. No. 29-26 \nat 4).  Supporters also stated their expectation that the Act would make the federal government's \n\"phone ring[] off the hook.\"  (Dkt. No. 29-25 at 24). \nThe final bill for Act 69 contained twenty separate sections.  Several sections closely \ntrack existing federal statutes relating to the harboring and sheltering of unlawfully present \npersons, possessing alien registration materials and making counterfeit picture identification \nmaterials.  See Act 69, §§ 4(B) and (D), 5 and 15.  The Act allows state enforcement and \nprosecution of what previously were exclusively federal offenses.  Other provisions of the Act, \napparently unique in American law, make it a state crime for unlawfully present persons to \nshelter, harbor or transport themselves.  Id.  § 4(A) and (C).  Another section of the Act directs all \n2 \"SLED\" is the acronym for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. \n3 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 4 of 42\nstate and local law enforcement officers making a traffic stop or arrest and having a \"reasonable \nsuspicion\" that the person may be unlawfully present in the United States to \"make a reasonable \neffort, when practicable, to determine whether the person is lawfully present in the United \nStates.\" !d. § 6(A).  This section goes on to identify various \"valid\" forms of identification \nwhich create a presumption that the person is lawfully present in the United States.  !d. § 6(B).  If \nthe person being arrested or stopped does not have one of these state-approved forms of \nidentification in his or her possession, then the law enforcement officer \"shall make a reasonable \neffort, when practicable, to verify the person's lawful presence in the United States.\" !d. § 6(C). \nIf the person is determined to be unlawfully present, state or local law enforcement officers are \nauthorized to \"securely transport the person to a federal facility in this State.\" !d. § 6(C)(4). \nThe Act further addresses employer sanctions, establishing an elaborate scheme of \nemployer licenses and making it unlawful for an employer to knowingly employ \"an \nunauthorized alien.\" !d. §§ 8-14.  Another provision mandates the determination of whether any \nperson arrested and detained at a jail or prison facility in South Carolina is unlawfully present in \nthe United States.  !d. § 7.  An additional provision authorizes private rights of action against any \npolitical subdivision enacting an ordinance interfering with enforcement of Act 69 or violating \nthe law intentionally.  !d. § 1.  The Act also establishes an Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit \nwithin SLED and provides that the \"director shall negotiate the terms of a memorandum of \nagreement with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement [(\"ICE\")] pursuant to \nSection 287(g) of the federal INA as soon as possible after the effective date of this act.\" !d. § \n17(A) and (E).  Finally, the Act contains a savings clause, severability clause and a section \nestablishing the effective date of the Act.  !d. §§ 18-20. \n4 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 5 of 42\nAct 69 was considered and approved by the South Carolina General Assembly during a \ntime period in which a number of states adopted similar immigration statutes and then faced \nlegal challenges to the newly adopted legislation in federal court.  The first state to adopt a \ncomprehensive immigration statute was Arizona.  Portions of its statute relating to the failure to \ncarry registration materials and the verification of immigration status of persons questioned in \nthe course of traffic stops were preliminarily enjoined by the district court, and that decision was \nsubsequently affirmed 2-1 by a panel of the Ninth Circuit.  United States v. Arizona, 703 F. \nSupp. 2d 980 (D. Ariz. 2010), aff'd, 641 F.3d 339 (9th Cir. 2011).  The United States Supreme \nCourt recently granted certiorari in that case.  Arizona v.  United States, No. 11-182,2011 WL \n3556224 (U.S. Dec. 12, 2011). \nOn June 24, 2011, an Indiana federal district court temporarily enjoined portions of a new \nIndiana state law limiting the use by foreign nationals of consular I.D.s for identification and \nauthorizing the making of warrantless arrests for non-criminal conduct.  Buquer v. City of \nIndianapolis, No. 11-708,2011 WL 2532935 (S.D. Ind. June 24, 2011).  Three days later, on \nJune 27, 2011, a federal district court in the Northern District of Georgia temporarily enjoined \nportions of a newly adopted Georgia statute that created state criminal sanctions for harboring \nand transporting unlawful aliens and mandated verification of the immigration status of any \nperson suspected of committing a crime.  Ga. Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Deal, 793 F. \nSupp. 2d 1317 (N.D. Ga. 2011).  Subsequently, the Alabama district court and the Eleventh \nCircuit temporarily enjoined portions of an Alabama state immigration statute prohibiting the \nharboring or transporting of unlawfully present aliens and requiring the carrying of alien \nregistration documents.  United States v. Alabama, No. 11-2746, 2011 WL 4469941 (N.D. Ala. \nSept. 28, 2011) and Hispanic Interest Coal. ofA  la. v. Bentley, No. 11-2484,2011 WL 5516953 \n5 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 6 of 42\n(N.D. Ala. Sept. 28, 2011), injunction pending appeal granted in part and denied in part, Nos. \n11-14532, 11-14535,2011 WL 4863957 (11th Cir. Oct. 14, 2011).  The district court and the \nEleventh Circuit, however, declined to grant a temporary injunction regarding a portion of the \nAlabama statute allowing for the verification of the immigration status of persons stopped by law \nenforcement officers.  !d. \nIn the above-captioned action brought by the United States, only four of the twenty \nsections of Act 69 are challenged.  The challenged sections include provisions in which the State \nof South Carolina essentially adopts federal statutes and creates new state criminal sanctions \nrelating to the harboring and transporting of unlawfully present persons (Subsections 4(B) and \n(D)), the failure to carry alien registration materials (Section 5) and the creation of fraudulent \nidentification documents (Section 15).  The United States also challenges the provisions making \nit a state crime for an unlawfully present person to transport or shelter himself (Subsections 4(A) \nand (C)) and the directive to local and state law enforcement officials to determine the \nimmigration status of certain persons encountered in routine traffic stops and other contacts in \nwhich there is a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the person may be in the United States unlawfully \n(Section 6).  The private plaintiffs also challenge Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act (but not Section \n15) and further assert that the provisions requiring the determination of the immigration status of \npersons detained in state and local jails (Section 7) and authorizing a private right of action to \nenforce the Act (Section 1) are unlawful.  The private plaintiffs also make a preemption \nchallenge to the Act in its entirety. \nBelow, the Court initially addresses various preliminary issues, including standing, \nexistence of a federal cause of action and jurisdiction, the preemption doctrine and standards for \npreliminary injunction.  The Court then addresses the plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the \n6 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 7 of 42\nmerits of their preemption challenges to the sections of Act 69 for which the plaintiffs have \nstanding.  Finally, the Court addresses the remaining elements of the preliminary injunction \nstandard and the issue of remedy. \nPreliminary Issues \nA. Standing \nStanding \"is a threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of the \ncourt to entertain the suit.\"  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  The plaintiffbears the \nburden of demonstrating \"a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\" that will be \nsufficient to warrant the party's \"invocation of federal court jurisdiction.\" Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488,493 (2009).  This requires the plaintiff to show: (1) \"he is under threat \nof suffering 'injury in fact' that is concrete and particularized\"; (2) \"the threat [is] actual and \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\"; (3) the threatened injury is \"fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant\"; and ( 4) it is likely that \"a favorable judicial decision will \nprevent or redress the injury.\" Id.  An organization has standing to sue as a representative of its \nmembers if the individual members have standing to sue, the interests sought to be protected are \ngermane to the organization's purpose and the suit does not require the participation of the \nindividual members.  Equity in Athletics, Inc. v. Dep 't ofE  duc., 639 F.3d 91, 99 (4th Cir. 2011). \nA plaintiff who challenges a statute must face a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury, but \nthe plaintiff need not await actual suffering of that injury, such as an arrest, to obtain preventive \nrelief.  Babbitt v.  United Farm Workers Nat'! Union, 442 U.S. 289,298 (1979). \nIn these actions, defendants do not contest the standing of the United States to assert \nchallenges to Sections 4, 5, 6 and 15 of the Act.  Defendants also do not contest the standing of \nthe private plaintiffs to assert challenges to Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act.  Defendants do, \n7 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 8 of 42\nhowever, contest the standing of the private plaintiffs to assert a challenge to the Act in its \nentirety on the basis of the alleged impermissible impact on the nation's foreign affairs and the \nAct's alleged impermissible burdening of federal financial resources.  Defendants also contest \nthe standing of the private plaintiffs to assert challenges to Sections I and 7 of the Act. \nThe Court recognizes its duty to make an independent determination of standing \nnotwithstanding the defendants' decision not to contest the plaintiffs' standing to assert \nchallenges to Sections 4, 5, 6 and 15 of the Act.  The complaint of the United States clearly sets \nforth the basis of its standing to challenge Sections 4, 5, 6 and 15 of the Act.  See Compl. ,-r,-r 2-6, \n15-32.  The private plaintiffs' complaint also sets forth sufficient allegations to establish standing \nto challenge Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act.  See Compl. ,-r,-r 44, 45, 48, 49. \nThe Court has trouble identifying the type of concrete and particularized injury that is \nsufficiently actual and imminent to satisfy standing requirements with regard to the private \nplaintiffs' challenge to the Act in its entirety on the basis of the impact on foreign affairs and \nfederal financial resources, or with regard to the private plaintiffs' challenges to Sections 1 and 7 \nof the Act.  The alleged injuries the private plaintiffs face as a result of Act 69's impact on \nforeign affairs and federal financial resources are too remote and speculative to confer standing. \nPrivate plaintiffs also do not face any concrete and particularized injury that is actual and \nimminent as a result of Section 1, which simply authorizes private civil actions against local \npolitical subdivisions who do not enforce the Act. \nSection 7 requires the verification of the immigration status of any person incarcerated or \ndetained in a jail facility and provides for potential delivery of incarcerated persons to federal \nfacilities if they are determined to be unlawfully present in the United States.  Initially, Section 7 \nappears to expose several of the private plaintiffs to a potential injury that is concrete and \n8 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 9 of 42\nparticularized since the operation of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act may result in one or more \nprivate plaintiffs being arrested and detained at a local or state prison facility.  See Hispanic \nInterest Coal. ofA  la., 2011 WL 5516953, at *44 (finding that private plaintiffs had standing to \nchallenge a provision which only applied to detained persons where private plaintiffs showed \nlikelihood that they may be subject to detention pursuant to specific laws).  In other words, the \ninjury which private plaintiffs could potentially suffer as the result of Section 7 is primarily \ndependent upon the implementation of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act.  (See Dkt. No. 93 at 26 \n(private plaintiffs arguing that they have standing to challenge Section 7 on the basis that they \nmay be arrested pursuant to Sections 4, 5 or 6 of the Act)).  However, as discussed later in this \nOrder, the Court finds that the United States and the private plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits oftheir challenges to Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act and will temporarily enjoin the \nenforcement of those challenged sections.  As a consequence of the Court's action regarding \nthose sections, the potential injury to the named private plaintiffs appears to the Court too remote \nand speculative to satisfy the requirements for standing to challenge Section 7.  The Court notes \nthat none of the named private plaintiffs are alleged to be incarcerated or otherwise likely \naffected by the operation of Section 7. 3 \nTo summarize the Court's rulings on standing, the United States has standing to \nchallenge Sections 4, 5, 6 and 15 of the Act, and the private plaintiffs have standing to challenge \nSections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act.  The private plaintiffs do not have standing to make a preemption \nchallenge to Act 69 in its entirety or to challenge Sections 1 and 7 of the Act. \n3 The United States has not challenged Section 7. \n9 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 10 of 42\nB. Federal Cause of Action and Jurisdiction \nDefendants assert that neither the United States nor the private plaintiffs have a federal \ncause of action which allows them to challenge Act 69 on the basis that it is preempted by \nfederal law.  (Dkt. No. 43 at 14-25).  Specifically, defendants argue that plaintiffs have no right \nof action under the Supremacy Clause and may not assert a Supremacy Clause claim as a matter \nof right under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Defendants then reach the conclusion that, since plaintiffs \nassert what defendants characterize as simply Supremacy Clause claims, both the United States \ngovernment and the private plaintiffs, potentially facing significant legal injury arising out of Act \n69, are powerless to challenge the deprivation of their rights in federal court.  This cannot be and \nis not the law. \nDefendants are correct that the Supremacy Clause itself\"is not a source of any federal \nrights\"; instead, it \"secure[s] federal rights by according them priority whenever they come in \nconflict with state law.\"  Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., 441 U.S. 600, 613 (1979). \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Chapman, \"all federal rights, whether created by treaty, by \nstatute, or by regulation, are 'secured' by the Supremacy Clause.\" !d.  Section 1983 provides a \nfederal remedy for the \"deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws\" ofthe United States.  42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nIn this case, both the United States and the private plaintiffs assert rights which are \nsecured by the Constitution and the laws.  First, the United States asserts that the federal \ngovernment's constitutionally guaranteed control of naturalization, foreign affairs and foreign \ncommerce is impaired and undermined by Act 69.  See U.S. Const. art. I,§ 8, cl. 3, 4; id. art. II,§ \n2, cl. 2.  Second, the private plaintiffs assert that in the event that a private plaintiff is arrested, \ndetained and/or incarcerated on the basis of a state statute rendered unlawful because it is \n10 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 11 of 42\npreempted by federal statutory or constitutional law, such seizure or deprivation of the person's \nfreedom of movement would constitute a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe United States Constitution.  Third, the private plaintiffs assert that the unlawful \nimplementation of a state criminal statute regulating immigration, when such a matter is \nexclusively within the control ofthe federal government pursuant to the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et \nseq., would violate an adversely affected person's legal rights under the INA. \nWith regard to the defendants' challenge to the private plaintiffs' right to bring this \naction, the determination of whether a federal constitutional or statutory provision creates a \nremedy under § 1983 involves a two step inquiry.  First, \"the plaintiff must assert the violation of \na federal right.\"  Golden State Transit Corp. v. City ofL os Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 106 (1989). \nThe Court is to look to the constitutional or statutory provision in question and determine \nwhether it creates rights intended to benefit the plaintiff.  !d.  Second, if the Court determines \nthat the statutory or constitutional provision does create a federal right, the defendant may then \nshow that Congress intended to foreclose a remedy under § 1983. !d. \nHere, it is clear from the plain language of the constitutional and statutory provisions at \nissue that the private plaintiffs have asserted federal rights in which § 1983 provides a remedy. \nThe private plaintiffs, potentially subject to arrest and incarceration from arguably invalid state \nimmigration statutes, have clearly identified rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nwhich can be asserted in such circumstances as presented here under § 1983.  Furthermore, the \nINA presents a comprehensive enforcement scheme exclusively under federal control, and this \nscheme creates the right by persons subject to the INA to be free from state statutory provisions \nconflicting with or preempted by the federal Act.  In a recent decision by the district court in the \nNorthern District of Georgia addressing a challenge to the Georgia immigration statute by \n11 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 12 of 42\nprivate plaintiffs, the court stated without equivocation that \"the Immigration and Naturalization \nAct ... creates a right enforceable under § 1983.\"  Ga. Latino Alliance for Human Rights, 793 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1327. \nThe Court finds instructive the long line of cases involving federal court decisions \naddressing the state regulation of immigration, all of which involved alleged violations of federal \nrights and all of which were brought by private plaintiffs.  In a case this past term, the United \nStates Supreme Court addressed the right of the state of Arizona to adopt various employer \nsanctions relating to the employment of unlawfully present aliens.  See Chamber of Commerce of \nthe U.S. v.  Whiting, 131 S. Ct. 1968 (2011).  The challenge to the Arizona statute was brought by \nthe United States Chamber of Commerce on behalf of its members and addressed the scope of \nfederal preemption ofthe state immigration-related legislation.  Surely if the United States \nChamber of Commerce, on behalf of its members, has a federal cause of action to challenge a \nstate statute affecting immigration on the basis of alleged federal preemption, then it stands to \nreason that the individuals adversely affected by an allegedly unlawful state immigration law \nwould also have a federal cause of action to challenge such a state law that would allegedly \ndeprive them of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. \nIn Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1 (1982), the Supreme Court dealt with the rights of students \nwhose parents had non-immigrant alien visas to qualify for in-state tuition at Maryland state \nuniversities.  The Court addressed the plaintiffs' rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the \nINA and determined that the state policy was preempted by federal law.  !d. at 13-17.  Further, \nthe Supreme Court in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941), voided a Pennsylvania alien \nregistration law, in an action brought by a private individual, on the basis that the state statute \nwas preempted by broad federal control over immigration policy.  Additionally, in what was \n12 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 13 of 42\namong the first and historically one of the most significant challenges to a state immigration \nstatute in American history, the United States Supreme Court in Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 US \n275 (1875), struck, on preemption grounds, a California statute which permitted a state official to \nexact a bounty from recently arriving immigrants as the price of admission into the United \nStates.  The lawsuit was brought by a private plaintiff, described by the Court as \"a subject of the \nEmperor of China.\" !d. at 276. \nTo accept defendants' argument that private plaintiffs have no cause of action to \nchallenge unlawful state immigration statutes would require this Court to rewrite American legal \nhistory and strike from the legal precedents some of the most foundational and majestic decisions \nin the Supreme Court's history.  The Court finds no basis in law to support such an argument. \nThe Court finds that the private plaintiffs have asserted sufficient allegations to state a claim \nunder § 1983. \nSimilarly, the Court rejects the defendants' argument that the United States, through the \noffice of the Attorney General of the United States, does not have a right to challenge Act 69 on \nthe basis that it is preempted by the INA and provisions of the United States Constitution vesting \nin the national government the authority to conduct foreign policy, regulate foreign commerce \nand administer a uniform system of naturalization.  In United States v. San Jacinto, 125 U.S. \n273, 279-80 (1888), the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Attorney \nGeneral lacked the inherent power to bring an action to void a fraudulently obtained land patent \nissued by the United States government.  Although recognizing that the Attorney General had no \n\"express authority\" to bring such a suit, the Court indicated that the national government was not \nso \"helpless\" and had the \"apparent authority\" to institute an action where its rights were \ninvolved.  !d. \n13 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 14 of 42\nThe authority of the Attorney General to institute a suit was again challenged in Sanitary \nDistrict of Chicago v.  United States, 266 U.S. 405 (1925), which involved a plan of a local \ngovernmental agency to withdraw large volumes of water from the Great Lakes and potentially \nadversely affect the navigable waters under the control of the national government.  The \nSupreme Court made short work of this contention, noting that \"[t]his is not a controversy \nbetween equals.\" Id. at 425.  Observing that the suit involved the \"United States ... asserting its \nsovereign power to regulate commerce and to control the navigable waters within its \njurisdiction,\" the Court concluded that the \"Attorney General by virtue of his office may bring \nthis proceeding and no statute is necessary to authorize it.\" Id. at 425-26; see also United States \nv. California, 332 U.S. 19,26-29 (1947) (holding that the Attorney General has \"statutorily \ngranted power to invoke [the federal court's] jurisdiction\" as a result of\"very broad authority ... \nto institute and conduct litigation in order to establish and safeguard government rights and \nproperties\"); Kern River Co. v.  United States, 257 U.S. 147, 154-55 (1921) (holding that \"the \ngeneral authority of the Attorney General in respect to pleas of the United States and the \nlitigation which is necessary to establish and safeguard its rights affords ample warrant for the \ninstitution and prosecution by him\" of forfeiture suits on behalf of the government); Abraham v. \nHodges, 255 F. Supp. 2d 539, 549 (D.S.C. 2002) (upholding the authority of the national \ngovernment under the Commerce Clause to challenge the actions of the governor of South \nCarolina seeking to prevent the importation of nuclear waste to federal facilities within the state); \n28 U.S. C. § § 515, 516, 517, 518 and 519.  It is an interesting historical fact that when Chy Lung, \nthe 1875 case that established the first legal precedent for federal control over immigration \nmatters, was argued before the United States Supreme Court, Attorney General Edwards \nPierrepont personally appeared to argue on behalf of the plaintiff and in support of the federal \n14 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 15 of 42\ngovernment's authority over foreign affairs and immigration matters.  92 U.S. at 276-77.  No \nlegal developments since Chy Lung have diminished the Attorney General's authority to assert \nand defend the powers of the national government granted by the Constitution. \nIn sum, the Court finds that the Attorney General has broad and sufficient authority to \nassert claims, such as those before the Court, which defend and affirm the national government's \npowers and prerogatives regarding the conduct of foreign relations, foreign commerce and a \nuniform system of naturalization.  Defendants' argument that the Attorney General requires \nexpress Congressional authority is contrary to the Supreme Court's long and distinguished \nhistory in upholding the United States' authority to assert its rights and claims in the United \nStates district courts.  To rule otherwise would render the powers of the federal government a \nnullity. \nFurther, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the private plaintiffs' suit.  The \"Eleventh \nAmendment confirms that the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity limits the grant of \njudicial authority in [Article] III.\"  Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985).  Generally \nspeaking, because of the Eleventh Amendment, states may not be sued in federal court without \nconsent or an intent by Congress to abrogate the state's sovereign immunity.  However, under Ex \nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155-56, 159 (1908), suit maybe brought in federal court to \"grant[] \nprospective injunctive relief to prevent a continuing violation of federal law.\"  Green, 474 U.S. \nat 68.  Such is the case here, in that the private plaintiffs seek relief on the ground that Act 69 \nconflicts with Congress' power to regulate immigration and is preempted by a federal statutory \nscheme. \nFinally, this Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  \"It is beyond \ndispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering \n15 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 16 of 42\nwith federal rights.\"  Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96 n.l4 (1983) (citing Ex parte \nYoung, 209 U.S. at 160-62).  \"A plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation, on the \nground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy \nClause of the Constitution, must prevail, thus presents a federal question which the federal courts \nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to resolve.\" ld. \nC. Preemption \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that the Constitution \nand laws of the United States \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land;  ... any Thing in the \nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" U.S. Const. art. IV, cl. 2. \nThe laws of the United States are \"supreme,\" and the \"law ofthe State ... must yield to it.\" \nGibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, 82 (1824).  \"[T]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone \nin every preemption case.\"  Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009). \nFederal preemption of a state law may be express or implied and \"is compelled whether \nCongress' command is explicitly stated in the statute's language or implicitly contained in its \nstructure and purposes.\"  Gade v. Nat'! Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass 'n, 505 U.S. 88, 98 (1992). \nExpress preemption occurs when Congress \"expressly declares its intent to preempt state law.\" \nPinney v. Nokia, 402 F.3d 430, 453 (4th Cir. 2005).  There are at least two types of implied \npreemption: field preemption and conflict preemption.  Gade, 505 U.S. at 98; Hines, 312 U.S. at \n67. \nField preemption occurs \"where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to \nmake reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.\"  Gade, \n505 U.S. at 98.  The regulation of immigration is the quintessential example of field preemption. \nThe Supreme Court succinctly stated inDeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351,354 (1976), that the \n16 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 17 of 42\n\"[p] ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power.\"  As Justice \nBlack explained in Hines, a case involving an attempt by the state of Pennsylvania to adopt an \nidentical state version of the federal alien registration law, \"where the federal government, in the \nexercise of it superior authority in this field, has enacted a complete scheme of regulation and \nhas therein provided a standard for registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with the \npurpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail or complement, the federal law, or enforce \nadditional or auxiliary regulations.\"  312 U.S. at 66.  An exception to field preemption exists \nonly where states have traditionally regulated in that area or where Congress has expressly \nreserved that power to the states.  Whiting, 131 S. Ct. at 1974, 1977 (recognizing an exception to \nfield preemption for state-adopted employer sanctions because states have traditionally regulated \nemployment and Congress explicitly excepted state licensing laws from preemption in the INA). \nConflict preemption occurs \"where compliance with both federal and state regulations is \na physical impossibility\" or where state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and \nexecution ofthe full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"  Gade, 505 U.S. at 98.  One ofthe \nways in which a state law may stand as an obstacle to full implementation of federal law is where \nthe state law \"interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach [its] \ngoal.\" !d. at 103.  States cannot avoid preemption of challenged state laws simply on the \nargument that the state and the federal government have the same \"ultimate goal.\" !d.  In \nevaluating a potential conflict preemption issue, the Court is to undertake a two step process. \nFirst, the Court must analyze the applicable state and federal statutes.  Second, the Court must \ndetermine if they are in fact in conflict.  Chi. & N  W.  Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co., 450 \nu.s. \n311,317 (1981). \n17 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 18 of 42\nThe Court should start any preemption analysis with a presumption against preemption. \nWyeth, 555 U.S. at 565.  This presumption is particularly strong where Congress has legislated in \nan area the states have traditionally occupied.  !d.  Conversely, the presumption against \npreemption is not strong in areas where the states have not traditionally legislated, most \nparticularly in areas which are \"inherently federal in character.\" Buckman Co. v. PlaintiffS' \nLegal Comm., 531 U.S. 341,347 (2001).  It is notable that in a number of recent decisions \ninvolving the adoption of state immigration statutes, courts have generally declined to apply a \npresumption against preemption because the field of immigration has traditionally been a \nresponsibility of the federal government and not the states.  See United States v. Arizona, 641 \nF.3d at 348; Ga. Latino Alliance for Human Rights, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 1330; United States v. \nAlabama, 2011 WL 4863957, at *12, 30, 39.  Whatever presumption against preemption exists \ngenerally has been demonstrably overcome here by the facts before the Court, including the \ntraditionally predominant role of the federal government in the field of immigration, and in the \nrelated fields of foreign affairs and foreign commerce, and the limited role in the past of the \n4 \nstates, including South Carolina, in the area of immigration regulation.\n4 Plaintiffs' preemption challenges to various sections of Act 69 pursuant to the Supremacy \nClause are necessarily \"facial\" challenges, as Act 69 is not yet in effect.  To the extent the \nplaintiffs are able to establish that portions of Act 69 are preempted by federal law pursuant to \nthe rules of preemption discussed above, the \"facial\" nature ofplaintiffs' challenge is not \nimportant.  See United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d at 345-46 (holding that, for purposes of \ndefendants' argument that the plaintiffs' challenge to the law was \"facial\" and not \"as applied,\" \n\"there can be no constitutional application of a statute that, on its face, conflicts with \nCongressional intent and is therefore preempted by the Supremacy Clause\").  As noted by the \nNinth Circuit, recent Supreme Court cases analyze \"facial\" preemption challenges without \nmentioning the standard for facial challenges.  !d. (citing Crosby v. Nat 'I Foreign Trade Council, \n530 U.S. 363 (2000) and Am. Ins. Ass 'n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396 (2003)). \n18 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 19 of 42\nD. Standards for Preliminary Injunction \nA preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy\" and \"is never awarded \nas of right.\"  Munafv. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008).  \"The purpose of a preliminary \ninjunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can \nbe held.\"  Univ. ofTex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  As the Fourth Circuit \nexplained in In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litigation, 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003), \"[t]he \ntraditional office of a preliminary injunction is to protect the status quo and to prevent irreparable \nharm during the pendency of a lawsuit ultimately to preserve the court's ability to render a \nmeaningful judgment on the merits.\" \nA moving party must establish the presence of the following: (1) \"a clear showing that it \nwill likely succeed on the merits\"; (2) \"a clear showing that it is likely to be irreparably harmed \nabsent preliminary relief'; (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of the moving party; and (4) a \npreliminary injunction is in the public interest.  Real Truth About Obama, Inc. v. Fed. Election \nComm., 575 F.3d 342, 346-47 (4th Cir. 2009); W.  Va. Assoc. of Club Owners & Fraternal Servs., \nInc. v. Musgrave, 553 F.3d 292, 298 (4th Cir. 2009).  These standards follow the newly \narticulated requirements for preliminary injunction set forth by the Supreme Court in Winter v. \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22-23 (2008).  Unlike the Fourth Circuit's \nprevious \"balance of hardship\" test set forth in Blackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig \nManufacturing Co., 550 F.2d 189, 196 (4th Cir. 1977), the moving party seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish the presence of each of the four requirements, satisfying the standards \nof each as articulated.  Real Truth About Obama, Inc., 575 F.3d at 347. \nChallenges to Specific Sections of Act 69 \nThe United States has challenged Sections 4, 5, 6 and 15 of Act 69, all which the Court \n19 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 20 of 42\nhas determined it has standing to challenge.  The private plaintiffs, like the United States, have \nchallenged Sections 4, 5 and 6, and the private plaintiffs have additionally challenged the Act in \nits entirety, as well as Sections 1 and 7.  The Court has determined, however, that the private \nplaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the Act in its entirety or Sections 1 and 7.  Thus, the \nCourt will address below the motions for preliminary injunction only as to Sections 4, 5, 6 and \n15.  The Court will not address the provisions of any other section of Act 69. \nThe Court will initially address those provisions of Act 69 which adopt or closely track \nthe provisions of existing federal immigration statutes.  These provisions-found at Subsections \n4(B) and (D), Section 5, Subsection 6(B)(2) and Section 15-seek to take what were previously \nonly federal crimes subject to federal prosecution and federal enforcement procedures, and make \nthem also state crimes subject to state prosecution and state enforcement procedures.  Plaintiffs \nassert that the enforcement of federal immigration law involves the exercise oflaw enforcement \nand prosecutorial discretion based upon well-developed federal priorities and the balancing of \nsometimes conflicting and competing national interests.  The United States asserts that the \nestablishment of separate and independent state enforcement procedures would likely conflict \nwith and disrupt federal interests and priorities, both in the area oflaw enforcement and in the \nareas of foreign relations and foreign commerce. \nThe Court will then address Subsections 4(A) and (C), which make it a state crime for an \nunlawfully present person to transport, shelter or harbor himself or herself.  The plaintiffs assert \nthat these provisions essentially make it a crime to be unlawfully present, which they assert is \ncontrary to and in conflict with federal immigration law.  Finally, the Court will address the \nprovisions of Section 6 which direct state and local law enforcement officers, when encountering \npersons whom they have a \"reasonable suspicion\" are unlawfully present in the United States, to \n20 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 21 of 42\nconduct an inquiry into their status and take action should they determine that such persons are in \nfact unlawfully present.  The United States asserts that such a state-mandated law enforcement \nscheme is contrary to federal immigration priorities, which focus upon unlawfully present \npersons who are national security and public safety risks, and would burden and disrupt federal \nimmigration enforcement efforts and the national government's administration of foreign policy. \nA. Challenges to State Criminalization of Federal Immigration Laws \n1. Subsections 4(B) and (D) \nSubsections 4(B) and (D) of Act 69 make it a state felony punishable by up to five years \nin prison to \"transport, move or attempt to transport\" or \"conceal, harbor or shelter\" a person \n\"with intent to further that person's unlawful entry into the United States\" or to help that person \navoid \"apprehension or detection ... by state or federal authorities.\"5  Federal law has long made \nit unlawful to \"transport or move\" or \"conceal[], harbor[] or shield[]\" an unlawful alien.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (iii).  The federal law authorizes state and local law enforcement \nofficers to make arrests for § 1324 violations, but prosecution is exclusively a federal prerogative \nwith prosecution and interpretation of the federal law handled by the federal courts.  !d. § \n1324(c). \nThe federal harboring and transporting statute,§ 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (iii), is part of a \nlarger statutory scheme which addresses comprehensively the actions of third parties aiding and \nassisting unlawful aliens.  Other provisions in this statutory scheme penalize persons unlawfully \nbringing aliens into the United States, 8 U.S.C. § 1323(a), and persons who import aliens for \nimmoral purposes, 8 U.S.C. § 1328.  Congress has expressly carved out a role for state and local \nlaw enforcement officers in this comprehensive statutory scheme, allowing them to make arrests \n5 These provisions were adopted by the South Carolina General Assembly initially in 2008 and \ncan be found at S.C. Code§ 16-9-460. \n21 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 22 of 42\nfor§ 1324 violations, while preserving control of prosecutions and judicial interpretation to \nfederal officials.  Subsections 4(B) and (D) disrupt this comprehensive federally controlled \nimmigration enforcement scheme by placing state prosecutors in control of enforcement efforts \nunder Subsections 4(B) and (D) and permitting state judges to interpret the harboring and \ntransporting statutes. \nThe United States asserts that Subsections 4(B) and (D) are preempted because \"South \nCarolina is improperly imposing its own substantive regulation over the movement of aliens in \nthe United States,\" something it asserts is the exclusive province of the federal government. \n(Dkt. No. 16-1 at 21).  The United States further asserts that the independent state penalties and \nprosecution \"operate wholly beyond federal control.\" (!d.)  Such an approach by the State, \nargues the United States, \"removes any federal discretion and impermissibly places the entire \noperation-including arrest, incarceration and statutory interpretation-squarely within the State's \ncontrol.\"  (!d.  at 22).  Further, the federal statute creates a safe harbor from prosecution for \npersons and bona fide religious organizations who bring an alien to the United States to \"perform \nthe vocation of minister or missionary.\"  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(C).  Subsections 4(B) and (D) do \nnot contain such a safe harbor provision, creating the potential scenario where a person acting \nlawfully under the federal harboring statute could be prosecuted by state officials for conduct \nexpressly excepted from federal criminal law. \nRecent court decisions have addressed similar state harboring and transporting statutes. \nIn United States v. Alabama, the district court preliminarily enjoined a state harboring and \ntransporting statute, noting both the loss of federal control over prosecution and judicial \ninterpretation and conflicts between the state and federal statutes.  The Alabama district court \nalso noted that this was not an area traditionally regulated by the state of Alabama.  2011 WL \n22 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 23 of 42\n4469941, at *41-43.  The district court reviewing the Georgia immigration statute, Georgia \nLatino Alliance for Human Rights v. Deal, reached a similar conclusion regarding Georgia's \nversion of the harboring and transporting statute.  The court, in granting a preliminary injunction, \nconcluded that the Georgia statute was an attempt to \"replace the discretionary and interpretative \nmechanism of the federal government\" with control by the state government.  793 F. Supp. 2d at \n1336.  The district court concluded that this was not acceptable because state and federal officials \nmay have different priorities, and the federal government must balance \"difficult (and often \ncompeting) objectives, of 'protecting national security, protecting public safety and securing the \nborder.\"' !d. at 1335 (quoting United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d at 352). \nIt is clear to the Court, after carefully comparing the relevant provisions of the INA, \nparticularly§§ 1323, 1324 and 1328, and Subsections 4(B) and (D) of Act 69, that Congress \nadopted a scheme of federal regulation regarding the harboring and transporting of unlawfully \npresent persons so pervasive that it left no room in this area for the state to supplement it.  Gade, \n505 U.S. at 98.  Thus, this is a classic case offield preemption.  The adoption of Subsections \n4(B) and (D) was part of a larger state effort to alter federal immigration enforcement priorities \nand to assert state control over such policy decisions.  (Dkt. No. 29-25 at 14).  While the Court \ndoes not doubt the good faith of the South Carolina General Assembly in attempting to address \nthe immigration issue, the Constitution of the United States and the INA have placed the policy \nmaking role regarding immigration in the hands of the national government.  Hines, 312 U.S. at \n401-04.  Further, in light of the express exception within§ 1324 authorizing state and local law \nenforcement officers to make arrests under that section, it is clear to the Court that Congress did \nnot intend to allow the states any further role beyond arresting persons allegedly harboring or \ntransporting unlawfully present persons.  Moreover, this is not an area traditionally regulated by \n23 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 24 of 42\nthe state.  Additionally, the inconsistent safe harbor provisions of state and federal law result in \nconflict preemption. \nTherefore, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have made a clear showing that they will \nlikely succeed on the merits of their challenge to Subsections 4(B) and (D), satisfying the first of \nfour prongs for the grant of preliminary injunctive relief.  The Court will address the balance of \nthe preliminary injunction standards regarding Subsections 4(B) and (D) in the remedy section of \nthis Order. \n2. Section 5, Subsection 6(B)(2) and Section 15 \nSection 5 of Act 69 makes it unlawful for any person 18 years or older \"to fail to carry\" \nin his or her possession \"a certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued \nto the person pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1304.\" The language of this Section closely tracks the \nfederal registration statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1304(e).  The adoption of the state provision would permit \nstate control of prosecutions for failure to carry federally issued registration materials, something \nthat is, now and historically, exclusively under the control of the national government.  Under the \nfederal enforcement scheme, there are few prosecutions for failure to possess alien registration \nmaterials.  Indeed, it appears that from 1994-2009, there have been only 14 federal prosecutions \nfor violating § 1304 in South Carolina.  (Dkt. No. 29-29 at 2). \nAccording to an affidavit filed by the former general counsel of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, prosecutions are rarely undertaken under§ 1304 because the system is \noutdated and the registration materials exclude numerous persons who are present lawfully. \n(Dkt. No. 29-30 at 14-15).  Among the persons who may not be in possession of registration \ndocuments pursuant to § 1304 but who are lawfully present in the United States are petitioners \nunder the Violence Against Women Act, persons granted humanitarian status based upon asylum \n24 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 25 of 42\nor protections of the Convention Against Torture, victims of trafficking who may have obtained \nauthorization from the Attorney General granting \"continued presence\" in the United States, and \nI-918 petitioners for U-Visa status filed by survivors of serious crimes who are cooperating with \nlaw enforcement authorities.  (!d. at 16; Dkt. No. 16-3 at 7-18).  These classes of persons would \nnot likely be prosecuted by the federal government but would nevertheless be subject to state \nprosecution for failure to be in possession of registration materials issued pursuant to § 1304. \nThere is little doubt that alien registration is a field under the exclusive control of the \nfederal government.  In fact, one of the seminal cases of federal law preemption of state \nimmigration laws is Hines v. Davidowitz, which involved the adoption by the state of \nPennsylvania of an alien registration law identical to the federal statute.  312 U.S. at 61.  The \nSupreme Court noted the foreign policy implications of competing state and federal registration \nlaws and the potential for such laws to create international tensions and reciprocal problems for \nAmerican nationals abroad.  !d. at 63-65.  The Supreme Court stated: \"It cannot be doubted that \nboth the state and federal registration laws belong to that class of laws which concern the exterior \nrelation of this whole nation with other nations and governments.\" !d. at 66.  In such a situation, \nthe state law on registration must \"yield\" to the federal law because the federal registration law is \nthe supreme law of the land.  !d.  Recent court decisions in Alabama and Arizona enjoined \nprovisions similar to Section 5.  See United States v. Alabama, 2011 WL 4863957, at *6; United \nStates v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d at 999. \nAn examination and comparison of Section 5 and the federal statutes relating to alien \nregistration documents demonstrate that the national government has adopted a pervasive and \ncomprehensive scheme that leaves no place for state regulation in this area.  The State of South \nCarolina has not traditionally regulated the area of alien registration materials.  This is, again, a \n25 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 26 of 42\nclassic case of field preemption.  Further, state enforcement of Section 5 creates the real risk that \npersons lawfully present in the United States but not in possession of federal alien registration \nmaterials would be subject to arrest, prosecution and incarceration, creating a conflict with \nfederal law and an obstacle to the full implementation of the objectives of Congress.  Thus, this \nlaw is also preempted pursuant to conflict and obstacle preemption. \nSubsection 6(B)(2) and Section 15 address the making, selling and possession of \ncounterfeit identification materials by persons unlawfully present in the United States. \nSubsection 6(B)(2) makes it unlawful for any person to possess or use a counterfeit ID as proof \nof lawful presence.  Section 15 makes it unlawful to make or sell counterfeit identification to a \nperson unlawfully present in the United States.  Federal law makes it a crime to counterfeit \nfederal immigration documents or to use such documents in an effort to satisfy immigration \nrequirements.  8 U.S.C. § 1324c(a)(l) and (2). \nAs mentioned above regarding Section 5, the federal government has adopted a pervasive \nand comprehensive regulatory scheme regarding alien registration that includes the regulation of \nregistration materials.  The State of South Carolina has not previously regulated in this area. \nUnder Subsection 6(B)(2) and Section 15, the State would have the ability to initiate arrests and \nprosecutions and judicially interpret state law regarding alien registration, all areas previously \nunder the exclusive control of the United States government.  Moreover, the state arrest and \nprosecution of persons with false identifications could generate tensions with foreign nations and \nretaliation against American nationals abroad, which support the argument of the United States \nthat such matters need to be under its exclusive discretion and control and are field preempted. \nTherefore, the Court finds that plaintiffs have made a clear showing that they will likely \nsucceed on the merits of their challenge to Section 5 and Subsection 6(B)(2), and the United \n26 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 27 of 42\nStates has made a clear showing that it will likely succeed on the merits of its challenge to \nSection 15, thereby satisfying the first of four prongs for the grant of a preliminary injunction \nregarding these sections of the Act.  The Court will address the balance of the preliminary \ninjunction standards regarding these sections in the remedy portion of this Order. \nB. Challenge to State Criminalization of Unlawful Presence \nSubsections 4(A) and (C) of Act 69 make it a criminal offense for an unlawfully present \nperson to allow himself or herself to be \"transported or moved\" within the state or to be harbored \nor sheltered to avoid apprehension or detection.  There is no comparable federal statute, and it \nappears that this provision is unique in American law.  Plaintiffs argue convincingly that this \nprovision is the equivalent of unlawful presence, which is notable because the federal \ngovernment has studiously avoided making unlawful presence a federal crime.6  Instead, the \nfederal government has made unlawful presence grounds for a civil removal proceeding, 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) and 1227(a)(l)(B) and (C), and has made unlawful presence an \nelement of a criminal act only if the person has previously committed a felony and has been \ndeported from, or voluntarily left, the United States after his or her conviction.  !d. § 1252c(a). \nIt is well-settled that \"[ w ]here a comprehensive federal scheme intentionally leaves a \nportion of the regulated field without controls, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn-not \nfrom federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined by action.\" P.R. Dep 't of Consumer Affairs \nv. Isla Petroleum Corp., 485 U.S. 495, 503 (1988).  Congressional intent can further be found in \n§ 1252c, which expressly authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to make arrests \npursuant to that section under the following specific circumstances: ( 1) the alien is illegally \n6 It is hard to imagine that an unlawfully present person would not necessarily be required to \nmove or shelter himself as incident to living in a particular location or community.  Thus, the \nprovisions of Subsections 4(A) and (C) are found by the Court to be the legal and practical \nequivalent to criminalizing unlawful presence. \n27 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 28 of 42\npresent in the United States; (2) the alien has previously been convicted of a felony and was \nthereafter deported or left the country; (3) the alien has reentered the United States; and (4) the \nstate or local law enforcement officer has confirmed the suspect's status with the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252c.  The striking limitations on the arrest powers \nof state and local officials regarding unlawfully present aliens in § 1252c reflect that state \nintrusion beyond that provided by statute is neither authorized nor welcome.  Subsections 4(A) \nand (C) go well beyond the strictures of§ 1252c. \nA review of Subsections 4(A) and (C) and the applicable provisions of federal \nimmigration law clearly demonstrates that Subsections 4(A) and (C) are field and conflict \npreempted.  These subsections seek to criminalize what Congress has chosen to treat only as a \ncivil offense.  Congressional intent to adopt a pervasive and comprehensive scheme in this area \nis clear, and further evidence of Congressional intent to limit the powers of the states to regulate \nin this area is demonstrated by the restrictions on state and local law enforcement arrest powers \nset forth in§ 1252c.  Therefore, the Court finds that plaintiffs have made a clear showing that \nthey will likely succeed on the merits of their challenge to Subsections 4(A) and (C) of the Act. \nThis satisfies the first prong for the grant of a preliminary injunction, and the Court will address \nthe balance of those prongs regarding these subsections in the remedy section of this Order. \nC. Challenge to Systematic State Plan Mandating Under Certain Circumstances \nVerification of Immigration Status of Persons Subject to Law Enforcement \nEncounters \nSection 6 of Act 69 directs state and local government law enforcement officers who \nhave stopped, detained, investigated or arrested any person for whom they have a \"reasonable \nsuspicion\" may be unlawfully present in the United States to \"when practicable ... determine \nwhether the person is lawfully present in the United States.\"  Act 69, § 6(A).  A presumption of \n28 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 29 of 42\nlawful presence is established under the Act if the person has certain designated forms of picture \nidentification, such as a state issued driver's license, military identification or a United States \npassport.  !d. § 6(B)(1).  If the person subject to the law enforcement encounter does not possess \none of the acceptable forms of identification, the \"officer shall make a reasonable effort, when \npracticable, to verify the person's lawful presence in the United States.\" !d. § 6(C)(1).  The \nstatute identifies acceptable methods of inquiry, including contact with the United States ICE \nLaw Enforcement Support Center and the newly created Illegal Immigration Enforcement Unit \nof SLED.  !d. § 6(C)(1 )(a)-(d). \nSection 6 goes on to provide that, should the person be determined to be unlawfully \npresent in the United States, the officer, after consulting with appropriate state or federal \nofficials, will decide whether to retain custody or deliver the unlawfully present person to State \nor federal officials.  The statute authorizes the officer to \"securely transport the person to a \nfederal facility\" without any requirement that the federal government assent to the delivery of the \nperson.  !d. § 6(C)(4). \nThe United States asserts that its immigration enforcement policy focuses on the \nidentification, apprehension and deportation of certain classes of unlawfully present persons, \nincluding those who \"pose a clear risk to national security,\" \"serious felons, repeat offenders or \nindividuals with a lengthy criminal record,\" \"known gang members\" or others \"who pose a \ndanger to public safety,\" and individuals with \"an egregious record of immigration violations.\" \n(Memorandum from John Morton, Director, U.S. ICE, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion \nConsistent with the Civil Immigration and Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the \nApprehension, Detention, and Removal ofA  liens (June 17, 2011), \nhttp://www.ice.gov/doclib/secure-communities/pdf/prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf; Dkt. No. \n29 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 30 of 42\n16-5 at 4 n.4).  The United States asserts that its enforcement efforts and immigration resources \nare directed toward those priority classes of unlawfully present persons and are fully absorbed in \nthe pursuit of those priority targets.  (See Declaration of Daniel H. Ragsdale, Executive \nAssociate Director of United States ICE, Dkt. 16-4).  The pursuit by state and local law \nenforcement officers of low priority targets through widespread traffic and street level dragnets \nmandated by Section 6 would, according to the United States, overburden federal immigration \nenforcement resources and disrupt the federal government's enforcement scheme.  (!d. at 17-26). \nIn the declaration submitted by Mr. Ragsdale of ICE referenced above, and not contested \nby any factual submissions of defendants, the United States has sufficient staff resources in \nimmigration to apprehend, process and deport 400,000 unlawfully present persons a year. \nThrough the 287(g) program and other initiatives, the United States has targeted unlawfully \npresent persons in local and state detention facilities and has absorbed a significant amount of its \nresources with this high priority group.  (!d. at 10-11, 18-25).  The sudden delivery by South \nCarolina law enforcement officials to federal immigration officials of persons who do not fit the \nhigh priority federal government profile, and who may simply have encountered law \nenforcement officers as a result of a burned out taillight or jaywalking, would, per the United \nStates, burden and disrupt federal immigration enforcement efforts. \nThe United States further asserts that the broad traffic and street level dragnet mandated \nby Section 6 could produce significant turmoil and tension with longtime American allies and \nneighbors within our hemisphere.  In a declaration submitted by Deputy Secretary of State \nWilliam Bums, the implementation by South Carolina of \"an inflexible immigration enforcement \npolicy based narrowly on criminal sanctions\" would \"interfere[] with the national government's \ncarefully calibrated policy of immigration regulation\" and potentially cause \"harm [to] a wide \n30 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 31 of 42\nrange of delicate U.S. foreign relations interests.\"  (Dkt. No. 16-2 at 5).  Secretary Bums \nidentifies three principal types of potential harms to American foreign interests from the South \nCarolina immigration statute: (1) \"reciprocal and retaliatory treatment ofU.S. citizens\" with \n\"significant potential harm to the ability of U.S. citizens to travel, conduct business and live \nabroad\"; (2) antagonization of foreign governments, making them \"less willing to negotiate with, \nassist, or support the United States across a broad range of foreign policy issues,\" including \nfavorable trade and investment agreements, cooperation with counter terrorism and drug \ntrafficking operations and support in various international bodies; and (3) the threat of \nundermining the standing of the United States in international bodies that address migration and \nhuman rights matters.  (Dkt. No. 16-2 at 7-8). \nSecretary Bums further notes that because of the potential foreign affairs implications of \nimmigration policies, the State Department \"plays a substantial role in administering U.S. \nimmigration law and policy, as well as in managing and negotiating their foreign relations \naspects and impacts.\"  (!d. at 11).  Because of the sensitivity of immigration issues in many \nforeign countries, immigration concerns are frequently raised in discussions and negotiations \nwith foreign governments.  (!d. at 17).  Secretary Bums asserts that it is, therefore, of vital \nnational concern that the federal government, and not an individual state, be responsible for the \ndevelopment and implementation of such a delicate foreign policy issue as immigration.  (!d. at \n24-26). The Secretary concludes his declaration by asserting that Act 69 \"runs significantly \ncounter to American foreign affairs interests, and ... its enforcement would ... undermine \nAmerican foreign policy.\"  (!d. at 39).  Defendants have offered no statements or other evidence \nto counter Secretary Bums' declaration regarding the potential adverse impact of Act 69 on \nAmerican foreign policy interests. \n31 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 32 of 42\nIt has long been recognized that \"at some point an exercise of state power that touches on \nforeign relations must yield to the National Government's policy, given the concern for \nuniformity in this country's dealings with foreign nations that animated the Constitution's \nallocation of the foreign relations power to the National government in the first place.\" \nGaramendi, 539 U.S. at 413.  In Federalist Paper No. 42, James Madison, one of the principle \ndraftsmen of the Constitution, observed the practical necessity of federal control of foreign \naffairs, noting that otherwise individual states would have the power to \"embroil the \nConfederacy [as a whole] with foreign nations.\"  The Federalist No. 42, at 237 (Forgotten Books, \n2008).  This point was reiterated by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 80 when he \nstated that the \"Union w[ ould] undoubtedly be answerable to foreign Powers for the conduct of \nits members.\" !d. No. 80, at 452.  Hamilton went on to observe that the \"peace of the WHOLE \nshould not be left at the disposal of the PART.\" !d. \nThe simple principle that the Constitution vests the national government with certain \nfundamental indicia of national sovereignty, including the control of foreign policy and foreign \naffairs and the administration of immigration, has long been beyond dispute in our constitutional \njurisprudence.  In Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U.S. 275 (1875), the state of California adopted a \nstatute authorizing a state officer to extract sums from newly arrived immigrants.  The United \nStates Supreme Court noted the potential foreign affairs implications of the state immigration \nrule and the risk of creating international conflict or retaliation.  If an international inquiry were \nto be made, the Court noted, \"[u]pon whom would such a claim be made?  Not upon the State of \nCalifornia; for, by our Constitution, she can hold no exterior relations with other nations.  It \nwould be made upon the government of the United States.\" !d. at 279.  Under the Constitution \n32 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 33 of 42\nof the United States, the power to pass such laws \"belongs to Congress, and not the States.\" Id. \nat 280. \nThe intimate relationship between the conduct of foreign affairs and immigration policy \nwas again addressed in the seminal state immigration regulation case of Hines v. Davidowitz. \nThe case involved Pennsylvania's effort to adopt a state alien registration system identical to the \nfederal system.  Justice Black, writing for the Court, observed that \"[ o ]ur system of government . \n. . imperatively requires that federal power in the field affecting foreign relations be left entirely \nfree from local interference.\"  312 U.S. at 63.  He went on to observe that \"[e]xperience has \nshown that international controversies of the gravest moment ... may arise from real or \nimagined wrongs to another's subjects inflicted, or permitted, by a government.\" !d. at 64.  In \nthe area of alien registration, Justice Black asserted, the law of the nation must be supreme and \nthe laws of the states \"must yield to it.\" !d. at 66.  He concluded that \"where the federal \ngovernment ... has enacted a complete scheme of regulation and has therein provided a standard \nfor the registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, conflict \nor interfere with, curtail or complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or auxiliary \nregulations.\" !d. at 66-67. \nStatutes similar to Section 6 have been adopted by Arizona, Alabama and Georgia, and \nthere has been some division on the constitutionality of these provisions by the reviewing courts. \nThe majority view, represented by decisions involving challenges to the Arizona and Georgia \nstatutes, is that such provisions are likely preempted and should be enjoined.  United States v. \nArizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d at 993-98, 1008, aff'd, 641 F.3d at 348-54; Ga. Latino Alliance for \nHuman Rights, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 1330-33.  The minority view, represented by a decision \n33 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 34 of 42\ninvolving a challenge to the Alabama statute, is that such provisions are not likely preempted and \nshould not be enjoined.  United States v. Alabama, 2011 WL 4469941, at *27-38.7 \nDefendants contend that Section 6 is effectively authorized by § 1357(g)(l 0), which \npermits officers or employees of state or local governments without a written agreement \"to \ncooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of \naliens not lawfully present in the United States.\"  Defendants contend that Act 69 is nothing \nmore than an effort to cooperate with the federal government in the pursuit of the common goal \nof immigration enforcement.  Since the State of South Carolina has now been sued by the \nnational government over its adoption of Act 69, it begs the question of the meaning of the word \n\"cooperate.\" \nThe Department of Homeland Security has issued a document titled Guidance on State \nand Local Governments' Assistance in Immigration Enforcement and Related Matters (Dkt. No. \n29-11), which addresses the Department's interpretation ofthe meaning of the word \"cooperate.\" \nThe Department asserts that the duty to cooperate with the Attorney General necessarily requires \nfederal primacy in immigration enforcement and requires any systematic state policy to be \nresponsive to federal direction and priorities.  (Jd. at 8-12).  The Department's interpretation of \nthe statute, which it is charged to enforce, is due some deference.  United States v. Mead Corp., \n533 U.S. 218,234 (2001) (\"[A]n agency's interpretation may merit some deference whatever its \nform, given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to \n7 Defendants in this case and the Alabama district court exhaustively discussed Judge Bea's \ndissenting opinion in United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d at 369-91.  This Court found more \npersuasive Judge Noonan's brief and thoughtful concurring opinion in the same decision in \nwhich he focused upon the foreign affairs implications of the Arizona immigration statute.  He \nobserved: \"What foreign policy can a federal nation have except a national policy? That fifty \nindividual states or one individual state should have a foreign policy is absurdity too gross to be \nentertained .... [T]he federal nation must speak with one voice.\" Id.  at 367. \n34 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 35 of 42\nthe agency ... and given the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial understandings \nof what a national law requires.\").  Moreover, the Department's interpretation of the term \n\"cooperate\" comports with the overall structure of the INA (which places primary responsibility \nfor immigration policy and enforcement on federal officials and limits state and local officials to \nnarrow and specific responsibilities) and the long line of jurisprudence that recognizes the \n\"power to regulate immigration is unquestionably ... a federal power.\"  Whiting, 131 S. Ct. at \n1974 (citing DeCanas, 424 U.S. at 354). \nIt is apparent to the Court from a review of the legislative debate surrounding the \nadoption of Act 69 and the language of the Act itself that supporters of Act 69 do not approve of \nthe federal government's strategy or actions regarding immigration enforcement.  (See Dkt. Nos. \n29-25 at 12, 13, 24; 29-26 at 47).  These members ofthe General Assembly, of course, have \nevery right to hold that opinion, but that opinion does not entitle the State of South Carolina to \nadopt its own immigration policy to supplant the policy of the national government.  The \nsupporters of Act 69 clearly seek to expand the pool of persons targeted for immigration \nenforcement beyond those high priority persons that are the focus of federal immigration policy. \nFar from seeking to \"cooperate\" with the federal enforcement strategy, they seek by Act 69 to \n\"control\" immigration policy and to alter it.  (Dkt. No. 29-25 at 14).  Further, state and local law \nenforcement officers are authorized to \"securely transport\" a person determined to be unlawfully \npresent in the United States \"to a federal facility.\" Act 69, § 6(C)(4).  This action can be taken by \na state or local law enforcement officer without any independent authorization so long as the \nunlawfully present person is not delivered to a federal facility outside South Carolina.  !d.  The \npolicy choices reflected in Act 69 may be many things, but they are not an effort to \"cooperate\" \n35 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 36 of 42\nwith the Attorney General.  Thus, § 1357(g)(1 0) does not provide the State a safe harbor for Act \n69. \nSection 6 is subject to both field preemption and obstacle preemption.  First, the federal \ngovernment's regulation of immigration enforcement is so pervasive and comprehensive that it \nhas not left any room for the state to supplant it.  Gade, 505 U.S. at 98.  This area has long been \nunder the control of the national government, and the State of South Carolina has not \ntraditionally regulated in this area.  Whiting, 131 S. Ct. at 1974.  Second, Act 69 burdens finite \nand limited federal immigration enforcement resources and acts as \"an obstacle to the \naccomplishment and execution ofthe full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"  Gade, 505 U.S. \nat 98.  Third, Act 69 improperly infringes on the federal government's exclusive control of \nforeign affairs.  No credible national sovereign can allow an individual state to embark on an \nindependent immigration policy that exposes the national government to a disruption of its \nforeign relations and ability to conduct and control foreign policy. \nThe State of South Carolina is not without options to address its particular concerns with \nthe federal government's immigration policy.  Section 1357 of the INA permits state and federal \ngovernments to enter into agreements to address specific matters or concerns of a state \ngovernment.  For reasons that are not clear to the Court, South Carolina elected to forego an \neffort to negotiate its own agreement with the federal government and instead adopted Act 69. \n(Dkt. No. 29-25 at 14).  Section 17(E) of Act 69, which is not affected by this Order, mandates \nthat after January 1, 2012, the Chief of SLED negotiate a 287(g) agreement with the federal \ngovernment.  Perhaps through good faith negotiations and frank discussion the State of South \nCarolina and the federal government can fashion an agreement to address, in whole or in part, the \n36 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 37 of 42\nconcerns of state officials without unduly burdening federal resources or disrupting the foreign \naffairs of the national government.8 \nBased upon the foregoing, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have made a clear showing \nthat they will likely succeed on the merits of their challenge to Section 6 of Act 69.  This satisfies \nthe first of four parts of the preliminary injunction standard.  The balance of those preliminary \ninjunction requirements will be addressed in the remedy portion of the Court's Order. \nRemedy \nPlaintiffs, having made a \"clear showing that [they] will likely succeed on the merits\" of \ntheir preemption challenge to Sections 4, 5, 6 and 15 of the Act, are entitled to preliminary \ninjunctive relief only if they can also make \"a clear showing\" that they are \"likely to be \nirreparably harmed absent preliminary relief,\" that the balance of equities tips in their favor and \nthat preliminary injunctive relief is in the public interest.  Real Truth About Obama, Inc., 575 \nF.3d at 346-47.  Below, the Court addresses these requirements for each of the challenged \nsections of Act 69. \nA. Section 4 \nThe challenges to Section 4 fall into two general categories, one relating to the \nsubsections making it a state crime for third parties to harbor, shelter or transport unlawfully \npresent persons (Subsections 4(B) and (D)), and the other relating to the subsections making it a \nstate crime for unlawfully present persons to harbor, shelter or transport themselves (Subsections \n4(A) and (C)).  Subsections (B) and (D) closely track existing federal criminal law, see 8 U.S.C. \n8 The Court notes that the United States did not challenge Section 7 of the Act, involving the \nmandating ofverification ofthe immigration status of persons in state and local government \nprisons and detention centers.  This section of the Act does appear to further national \nimmigration policy objectives, which is presumably the basis for the United States' decision not \nto challenge it.  This suggests to the Court that there may be common ground between state and \nfederal officials for purposes of reaching a 287(g) agreement. \n37 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 38 of 42\n§ 1324, and were originally adopted in 2008 as S.C. Code§ 16-9-460.  Control ofthe \nprosecution and judicial interpretation of this area of statutory law has been traditionally a \nfederal government prerogative.  The United States asserts that the creation of an independent \nstate regime of prosecution and judicial interpretation for those harboring, sheltering and \ntransporting unlawfully present persons will disrupt and conflict with the comprehensive federal \nenforcement scheme.  Further, the likely state prosecutions of lawfully present foreign nationals \n(who may be family and friends of the unlawfully present persons) could raise significant foreign \nrelations issues.  Moreover, the federal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(C), provides an express \nsafe harbor for persons who bring an alien to the United States to perform duties as a minister or \nmissionary, and Section 4 provides no such safe harbor.  This creates a real risk of persons being \nsubject to state prosecution under Section 4 of Act 69 when the same conduct would be lawful \nunder federal law.  The United States asserts this conflict in state and federal law could create a \nchaotic situation in immigration enforcement. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that plaintiffs have made a clear showing that \nthey will likely suffer irreparable injury should Subsections 4(B) and (D) become effective.  The \nCourt further finds that the balance of equities tips decidedly in plaintiffs' favor, and the public \ninterest is served by the grant of preliminary injunctive relief.  Therefore, the Court grants a \npreliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of Subsections 4(B) and (D) of Act 69 and S.C. \nCode § 16-9-460 until further order of this Court. \nSubsections 4(A) and (C) create the equivalent of a state crime for unlawful presence \nand, as such, create a conflict with federal immigration law which treats unlawful presence as a \ncivil enforcement matter.  Plaintiffs assert that this conflict between state and federal law would \ndisrupt the federal enforcement scheme and create a potentially chaotic situation in which \n38 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 39 of 42\npreviously civil enforcement matters would be criminalized under the South Carolina scheme. \nThis obviously raises potential foreign affairs sensitivities, which were well articulated by \nSecretary Bums in his declaration.  The Court finds that plaintiffs have clearly shown that they \nwill suffer irreparable injury should these subsections become effective.  The Court further finds \nthat the balance of equities tips decidedly in favor of plaintiffs, and the public interest is served \nby the grant of preliminary injunctive relief.  Therefore, the Court grants a preliminary injunction \nenjoining the enforcement of Subsections 4(A) and (C) of Act 69 until further order of this \nCourt. \nB. Section 5 \nSection 5 closely tracks existing federal statutory law requiring the carrying of federal \nregistration cards by aliens present in the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1304.  Plaintiffs have \nprovided the Court with evidence that this statute is now only rarely enforced by federal officials \nbecause the federal registration system does not cover numerous aliens lawfully present in the \nUnited States, including asylum seekers, victims of torture, persons cooperating with law \nenforcement officials in criminal prosecutions and other classes of persons who are lawfully \npresent.  Section 5 contains no safe harbor or exception for such classes of persons who do not \nhave federal registration documents.  Plaintiffs persuasively assert that state criminal \nprosecutions for the failure to carry federal registration materials under Section 5 could create a \nchaotic situation regarding the large classes of persons subject to state prosecution who would \nalmost certainly not be subject to federal prosecution.  The United States further asserts that it \nhas exclusively controlled this area of the law, and a significant number of arrests under Section \n5 could raise troublesome foreign relations issues and result in retaliation of American nationals \nabroad. \n39 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 40 of 42\nThe Court concludes that plaintiffs have clearly shown that they will likely suffer \nirreparable injury should Section 5 be enforced.  The Court further finds that the balance of \nequities clearly tips in favor of plaintiffs and that the grant of a preliminary injunction is in the \npublic interest.  Therefore, the Court grants a preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement \nof Section 5 until further order of this Court. \nC. Section 6 \nSection 6, excepting the provisions of Section 6(B)(2), mandates that every law \nenforcement encounter with any person be infused with consideration of the person's legal status \nin the United States.  If the officer has a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the person may be \nunlawfully present, Section 6 directs the officer to undertake certain inquiries and actions where \n\"practicable.\" This state-mandated scrutiny is without consideration of federal enforcement \npriorities and unquestionably vastly expands the persons targeted for immigration enforcement \naction.  The United States asserts that this state statutory scheme will disrupt federal enforcement \noperations and burden finite immigration enforcement resources.  The breadth and volume of \nthese state-mandated immigration inquiries and investigations would, according to the United \nStates, raise significant foreign relations problems that would likely adversely affect American \nforeign policy interests. \nThe Court finds that plaintiffs have clearly shown that they will likely suffer irreparable \ninjury should Section 6 be enforced.  The balance of equities tips decidedly in favor of plaintiffs, \nand the public interest is served by the grant of preliminary injunctive relief.  Therefore, the \n40 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 41 of 42\nCourt grants a preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of Section 6 until further order \nofthis Court, except as to 6(B)(2) which is specifically addressed below.9 \nSection 6(B)(2) makes it a state crime to possess or attempt to use a fraudulent I.D. for \nthe purpose of establishing lawful presence in the United States.  The United States asserts that \nfederal law now exclusively regulates this area and that enforcement of this subsection would \ncreate an independent scheme of prosecution and judicial enforcement outside the control of the \nfederal government and without regard to federal immigration enforcement priorities.  The \nUnited States further asserts that discretionary decisions to treat certain matters as civil, rather \nthan criminal, are carefully calibrated to accomplish immigration enforcement ends without \nunduly disrupting the nation's relations with foreign governments.  Since the South Carolina \nenforcement scheme is exclusively criminal in nature and outside the control of the federal \ngovernment, the United States asserts that irreparable injury to the nation's foreign policy is \nlikely. \nThe Court finds that the United States has made a clear showing that it will likely suffer \nirreparable injury should Section 6(B)(2) be enforced.  The equities tip in favor of the United \nStates, and the public interest would be served by a grant of preliminary injunctive relief. \nTherefore, the Court grants the preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of Section \n6(B)(2) until further order of this Court. \n9 Nothing in this Order should be construed to prevent a state or local law enforcement officer, in \nthe exercise of his or her discretion, from investigating any potential immigration law violation \nor from taking action in an immigration matter as may be authorized by federal law.  Since any \nstate or local government immigration enforcement activity should be in cooperation with the \nAttorney General and in furtherance of federal enforcement activities, state and local officers \nshould act consistently with federal immigration policy objectives as set forth from time to time \nin official circulars, policy statements and regulations of agencies charged with federal \nimmigration enforcement. \n41 \n\n2:11-cv-02958-RMG     Date Filed 12/22/11    Entry Number 64      Page 42 of 42\nD. Section 15 \nSection 15 prohibits the making or selling of counterfeit I.D.s for the use of persons \nunlawfully present in the United States.  Private plaintiffs do not challenge this section.  The \nUnited States asserts that this area is already addressed by the comprehensive federal \nimmigration enforcement effort and that exclusive federal control of such matters is important. \nWhile the Court has found that the United States will likely prevail on its legal challenge that \nSection 15 is preempted by federal law, the Court is not persuaded that the United States will \nsuffer irreparable harm should a preliminary injunction not be granted.  Enforcement of this \nsection does not appear to the Court to necessarily involve the arrest and prosecution of \nunlawfully present persons and would not likely raise the foreign policy sensitivities raised by \nother sections of Act 69 addressed above.  The Court concludes that the United States has not \nmade a clear showing that it will likely suffer irreparable harm should Section 15 be enforced, \nand therefore, the motion for preliminary injunction as to Section 15 is denied. \nConclusion \nThe Court hereby grants the motions for preliminary injunction regarding Sections 4, 5 \nand 6 of Act 69, and S.C. Code§ 16-9-460, until further order ofthis Court. \nAND IT IS SO ORDERED. \nRic  ard Mark Gergel \nUnited States District Judge \nCharleston, South Carolina \nDecember ~ 2011 \n42 ",
