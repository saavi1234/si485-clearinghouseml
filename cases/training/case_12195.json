No. 1:09-cv-174 LG RHW \nMISSISSIPPI REGIONAL HOUSING \nAUTHORITY VIII, SBMC, INC. (d/b/a \nSun Belt Mllllagement), OAKRIDGE \nPARK APARTMENTS, LTD. and BOBBY \nG. MARCELLUS, GENERAL PARTNER, \nDefendants. \nCONSENT DECREE BETWEEN PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND \nDEFENDANTS SBMC. INC. (d/b/a Sun Belt Management), OAKRIDGE PARK \nAPARTMENTS. LTD. AND BOBBY G. MARCELLUS. GENERAL PARTNER \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nOn February 17, 2009, the United States filed this action on behalf of Mary Waltman \npursuant  to  Title VIII  of the  Civil  Rights Act of 1968,  as  amended  by  the  Fair  Housing \nAmendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq., (the \"Fair Housing Act\").  According to the \nComplaint, Ms. Waltman is a person with disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.c. § 3602(h). \nDefendant Oakridge Park Apartments, Ltd. owns Oakridge Park Apartments, phase I, \nlocated  in  Biloxi,  Mississippi.  Defendant  Bobby  G.  Marcellus  is  the  General  Partner  of \nOakridge Park Apartments, Ltd.  Defendant SBMC, Inc. (d/b/a Sun Belt Management) manages \nOakridge Park Apartments, Phase 1.  Hereinafter these defendants will collectively be referred to \nas \"Defendants.\"]  Mary Waltman lived at Oakridge Park Apartments, Phase I.  Phase I consists \nof approximately 40 apartment units in Biloxi, MS. \n! The MS Regional Housing Authority is also a Defendant to this litigation. However, that agency is not a party to \nthis Consent Decree. \n\nThe Complaint alleges that Defendants discriminated against Mary Waltman when they \ndid not transfer Ms. Walbnan to a first·tloor apartment.  SpecificalJy. the Complaint alleges the \nfollowing:  that  Defendants discriminated in the rental  of, or otherwise made Wlavailable or \ndenied,  a  dwelling to  Ms.  Waltman  because of her disability in violation of 42  U.S.C.  § \n3604(f)(1);  that Defendants discriminated against Ms.  Waltman in the terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of a rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with \nsuch a dwelling, because of her disability,  in violation of 42  U.S.C.  § 3604(1)(2);  and that \nDefendants refused to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services \nwhen  such  accommodations  may  have  been  necessary  to  afford  Ms.  Waltman  an  equal \nopportunity to us. and enjoy a dwelling, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3){B). \nOn or about June 28, 2006.

Said  Complaint was amended  on November 3,  2008,  to  alter  the list  of \nrespondents.  HUD conducted an investigation of the complaint, determined that reasonable \ncause existed to believe that the alleged discriminatory housing practices had occurred, and \nissued a Charge of Discrimination to all defendants.  After Defendant Mississippi  Regional \nHousing Authority (\"MRHA\") elected to proceed in federal court, HUD authorized the Attorney \nGeneral to commence a civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3612(0). \nDefendants filed  timely Answers to the plaintifrs Complaint in this matter.

Additionally, Defendants \nhave asserted that SBMC complied with the request for reasonable accommodation under the \nFair Housing Act made by Ms. Walbnan's attorney by tetter dated January 30, 2006, requesting \nthat Ms. Waltman be released from her obligations under her Lease with SBMC as a reasonable \naccommodation for Ms. Waltman's alleged disability \nDefendants have entered into this Consent Decree for purposes of settlement only, and \nneither the entry of this Decree, nor any action taken lUlder it, shall be construed as an admission \nby Defendants of any fault or wrongdoing, or as an admission of the validity of the United \nStates' claims. \nThe parties agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345 and 42 U.S.C. § 3612(0). \nThe parties agree that, to avoid costly and protracted litigation, the claims against the \nDefendants should be resolved without further proceedings or an evidentiary hearing.
