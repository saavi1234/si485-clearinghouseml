    "summary": "<p>On March 12, 1991, prisoners at two Sacramento County jails filed a class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California against the County of Sacramento. The plaintiffs, represented by the Prisoner Rights Union and by private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the constitutionality of their conditions of confinement. Specifically, they alleged problems with overcrowding, failure to provide beds, unequal access for women prisoners, lack of exercise, inadequate access to medical, dental and mental health treatment, and lack of law library access. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p><p>On April 5, 1991, the Court (Judge William B. Shubb) granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the County from sleeping inmates on the floor. The Court (Judge Gregory G. Hollows) partially granted a subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction on June 3, and denied a third motion on August 16. (The substance of the injunction requested in each motion is unclear from the docket.) It mostly denied a fourth motion, in which plaintiffs sought an order compelling the County to give them physical access to the jail law library, on November 20, 1991, but did order the County to post a list of available law materials in the jail's dayrooms. <i>Kaiser v. Cnty. of Sacramento</i>, 780 F. Supp. 1309 (E.D. Cal. 1991). </p><p>On December 6, 1991, the Court (Judge Hollows) denied a motion to dismiss by the County and granted a motion by the plaintiffs to certify the case as a class action.</p><p>Discovery continued over the course of the following year, with the Court compelling the County to disclose documents and respond to other discovery requests on several occasions and granting an interim award of attorneys' fees and costs to plaintiffs.</p><p>On November 17, 1992, plaintiffs requested a settlement conference, and the parties began to work on a settlement with the help of Magistrate Judge John F. Moulds. Discovery disputes continued, and defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on December 14. They filed an additional motion for summary judgment on the issue of opportunity to exercise on December 22.</p><p>On January 28, 1993, the Court (Judge Hollows) approved a proposed consent decree. Under the terms of the decree, the County agreed that it would not house more than 2,000 prisoners in the main jail, that it would maintain its law library and allow access on reasonable notice, that it would assign female prisoners to the main jail as workers on a voluntary basis only, and that it would provide regular access to medical and dental care and regular opportunities to exercise. The County also agreed to pay $140,000 in attorneys' fees.</p><p>The Court entered final judgment on March 3, 1993.</p><p>On July 15, 1998, the County moved to terminate or amend the consent decree. The parties agreed to an amendment, the content of which is unclear from the docket, on August 31, 1998.</p><p>The County moved again to amend the consent decree on October 17, 2008, seeking to replace the law library with a contracted legal research service and to allow psychiatric patients to be housed at one of the facilities covered by the decree. The Court (Judge Hollows) granted the motion as to the housing of psychiatric patients on October 27, 2009. The consent decree was further modified on March 7, 2013, removing books from the law library and replacing them with computers. Inmates objected to this modification, stating that some inmates did not know how to use computers. The Court held that this objection was not an issue because computerized research is similar to using an index to search for relevant materials. In the same holding, the Court denied a class member's motion to intervene. On July 16th, 2013, the case was assigned to U.S. District Court Judge William B. Shubb and U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory Hollows. As of February 7, 2020, there has been no further activity in this case.</p>",

defendants.\n \nAMENDED ORDER\nGREGORY G. HOLLOWS, United States Magistrate Judge.\nThis matter came on regularly November 7, 1991, for hearing on plaintiffs'\nmotion for a preliminary injunction to provide adequate access to law books,\n  legal materials and legal assistance from other inmates. Paul Comiskey and\nRichard  Herman  appeared  for  plaintiffs.  Michele  Bach  and  Steven  Kaiser\nappeared for defendants. Having now reviewed the record and heard oral argument, the court\nissues the following order.\nBACKGROUND\nOn  March  12,  1991,  plaintiffs  filed  the  underlying  complaint  in  this  action,  challenging  the\nconditions of confinement at the Sacramento County Jail.1 Plaintiffs' claims include allegations of\novercrowding, failure to provide beds, unequal access for women prisoners, lack of exercise,\ninadequate access to medical/mental health/dental treatment and lack of law library access. This is\nplaintiffs' fourth motion for injunctive relief. At issue in the instant motion is whether plaintiffs are\nentitled  to  preliminary  injunction  on  their  claims  of  inadequate  access  to  the  law  library/legal\nassistance. Specifically, plaintiffs are seeking an order from the court compelling defendants to\nprovide physical access to the law library. Plaintiffs have submitted four declarations in support of\ntheir injunctive relief request. Most of the plaintiff's complaints concern the present \"slip\" or \"request\"\nsystem for obtaining legal research.\nJoseph Kaiser claims that he was incarcerated at the Sacramento County Jail (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the Main Jail\") from October 12, 1990, to approximately May 30, 1991, and at Rio\nCosumnes (hereinafter referred to as \"RCCC\") from May 30, 1991, to July 30, 1991. He states that\nhe was denied physical access to the law library and was required to use a \"slip\" or \"request\"\nsystem. Kaiser states that he only received his requests one out of four times and that the books\nwere often outdated. Kaiser also states that defendants failed to allow him to communicate with the\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 1/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\njailhouse lawyers.\nJoseph Hamburg has been incarcerated at the Sacramento County Jail since March 10, 1991.\nHe is representing himself in his\n[ 780 F.Supp. 1311 ]\ncriminal  proceedings  because  he  claims  the  public  defender  was  not  providing  adequate\nrepresentation. Plaintiff claims that he has obtained some assistance from jailhouse lawyers. Plaintiff\nalso contends that he is unable to update the case law.2\nRonald Marks has been incarcerated at the Sacramento County Jail since September 23, 1991.\nHe is representing himself in his criminal proceedings because his past experience with public\ndefenders  shows  that  they  do  not  have  adequate  time  to  defend  him.  Plaintiff  contends  that,\nbecause of his inadequate access to the proper law books, he was prejudiced at his preliminary\nhearing. Additionally, plaintiff claims that he does not know what books are available as defendants\nhave failed to provide a list of their legal materials. Marks also states that he has no access to the\njailhouse lawyers because they have been moved to other floors.\nSydney Olden has been incarcerated at the Sacramento County Jail since July 5, 1991. He\nstates that he has no access to the jailhouse lawyers nor any physical access to the law library.\nOlden contends that the slip system forces the inmates to provide the exact cite. The lack of\nphysical access is further compounded by the fact that no listing of legal materials is available to the\ninmates.\nANALYSIS\nI. Preliminary Injunction Legal Standards\nThe general legal principles applicable to a request for preliminary injunctive relief are well\nestablished. To prevail, the moving party must show either \"(1) a likelihood of success on the merits\nand the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) the existence of serious questions going to the merits\nand  the  balance  of  hardships  tipping  in  [the  moving  party's]  favor.\"  Oakland  Tribune,  Inc.  v.\nChronicle Publishing Co., Inc.,762 F.2d 1374, 1376 (9th Cir.1985), quoting Apple Computer, Inc. v.\nFormula Int'l,725 F.2d 521, 523 (9th Cir.1984); see also Hartikka v. United States,754 F.2d 1516,\n1518 (9th Cir.1985). The two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale with the focal point\nbeing the degree of irreparable injury shown. Oakland Tribune, 762 F.2d at 1376. \"Under either\nformulation of the test, plaintiff must demonstrate that there exists a significant threat of irreparable\ninjury.\" Id. In the absence of a significant showing of irreparability, the court need not reach the issue\nof  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits.  Id.  However,  where  an  injunction  seeks  to  remedy  a\nconstitutional violation and affect the operation of state or local government, there are additional\nconsiderations.\nGenerally, irreparable harm is presumed if a violation of the constitution is shown. Goldie's\nBookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court of the State of California,739 F.2d 466, 472 (9th Cir.1984). But\nwhere a federal injunction is sought against a governmental entity, the party requesting relief must\nshow a threat of \"great and immediate,\" not conjectural or hypothetical, irreparable harm. City of Los\nAngeles v. Lyons,461 U.S. 95,  113,  103  S.Ct.  1660,  1671,  75  L.Ed.2d  675  (1983);  see  also,\nOrantes­Hernandez v. Thornburgh,919 F.2d 549, 557 (9th Cir.1990). Therefore, in the instant case,\nplaintiffs must show a likelihood of real, immediate and non­conjectural violations of constitutional\nrights before the court will apply the presumption of irreparable harm.\nOne final point concerning the last prerequisite for injunctive relief, the balance of hardships,\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 2/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\nmust be made. A finding of irreparable harm in the constitutional sense does not also give rise to a\npresumption that the hardships entailed with an interlocutory injunction favor the party claiming the\nconstitutional violations. A factual showing must be made contrasting the harm to be suffered by the\nmoving party if an interlocutory injunction is not\n[ 780 F.Supp. 1312 ]\nissued with the harm to be suffered by the defending party if injunctive relief is ordered. The difficulty\nin this assessment is that the harms are not often of the same type. One party's considerations may\nbe financial in nature while another is attempting to protect an intangible right. The differences in the\nnature of the harms to be suffered in this case classically illustrate the point. While it is true that\nfiscal constraints cannot serve as an excuse to avoid clear legal obligations, Miller v. Carlson,768\nF.Supp. 1341, 1343 (N.D.Cal. 1991), in interlocutory injunctive relief situations demonstrating only\n\"serious questions,\" a court should be hesitant to impose heavy financial obligations on a party prior\nto a fully developed record.\nII. Procedural Arguments\nDefendants have raised a number of procedural arguments which the court will address before\nproceeding to the merits of plaintiff's request for injunctive relief. Specifically, defendants challenge\nplaintiffs' standing, pleading and class certification.\nFirst,  defendants  claim  that  plaintiffs  lack  standing  to  challenge  the  adequacy  of  the  law\nlibrary/legal assistance because they have failed to allege any actual injury (i.e., they lost a case in\nwhole or in part). Defendants' arguments concerning standing and pleading are erroneous under\nSands v. Lewis,886 F.2d 1166 (9th Cir. 1989). In Sands, the Ninth Circuit clarified the pleading\nrequirements for a right of access claim: \"... if one of the core requirements under Bounds  is\ninvolved — the adequacy of law libraries or legal assistance — then there is no `actual injury'\nrequirement.\" Id. at 1171. Here, plaintiffs have met the standing requirement by alleging that they\nwere, or will be, denied access to an adequate law library and have been denied access to legal\nassistance.  Plaintiffs'  claims  that  they  are  denied  access  to  an  otherwise  adequate  library  is\nscrutinized as one of the core requirements of Bounds. See, Toussaint v. McCarthy,801 F.2d 1080,\n1109 (9th Cir.1986). Thus, plaintiffs in the instant case have standing to challenge law library/legal\nassistance access.3\nIn addition, defendants claim that the pleading of plaintiffs' third amended complaint is deficient.\nDefendants note that plaintiffs have only alleged that they were denied access to the law library and\nhave failed to state that they were also denied access to alternative legal assistance. However,\nplaintiffs need only allege \"one of the core requirements under Bounds\" in order to state a claim for\nwhich relief can be granted. Sands, 886 F.2d at 1171. Thus, plaintiffs in the instant case have\nsatisfied the pleading requirements merely by alleging denial of access to an adequate law library.4\nFinally, defendants contend that class­wide injunctive relief would be inappropriate as the court\nhas  not  yet  certified  the  class.  The  court  has  provisionally  certified  the  class  pursuant  to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) pending modification or decertification should it become clear that the class is\nnot maintainable. See April 5, 1991 Order.5 Accordingly, the court may continue to grant injunctive\nrelief on a class­wide basis.\nIII. Right of Access to the Courts\nIt is well settled that states must ensure indigent prisoners meaningful access to the courts.\nBounds v. Smith,430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). In Bounds, plaintiffs,\nincarcerated inmates in the state prison system, filed civil rights actions claiming that the state had\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 3/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\ndenied plaintiffs reasonable access to the courts by failing to provide adequate\n[ 780 F.Supp. 1313 ]\naccess to a law library. The district court held that the sole prison library was severely inadequate\nand must be made adequate, but that the state was not required to provide legal assistance in\naddition to an adequate library. The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment in all\nmaterial respects, and the Supreme Court in turn affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The\nCourt held that the constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to provide\nprisoners either with adequate libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law. Id.\nat  828,  97  S.Ct.  at  1498.  The  Court  further  noted  that  while  adequate  law  libraries  are  one\nconstitutionally  acceptable  method  of  assuring  meaningful  access  to  the  courts,  they  do  not\nforeclose alternative means of achieving this goal. Id. at 830­832, 97 S.Ct. at 1499­1500.\nThe Ninth Circuit has determined that a paging system in a state prison facility is insufficient to\nguarantee prisoners the right of access to the courts. Toussaint v. McCarthy,801 F.2d 1080, 1109­\n1110 (9th Cir.1986). The unconstitutional paging system in Toussaint consisted of a process in\nwhich  the  correctional  staff  provided  prisoners  with  requested  law  books  as  an  alternative  to\nphysical access to the institution's law library. However, a jail facility serves different purposes than\na state prison, which houses, for the most part, convicted prisoners. The majority of persons in need\nof a law library in a jail setting would be those persons awaiting trial on criminal offenses.\nAt issue in the instant case is whether Bounds and its progeny apply with equal force to pre­trial\ndetainees as they apply to convicted prisoners. The primary issue here centers around the interplay\nbetween the right of access to the courts guaranteed by Bounds and Toussaint with the right of self­\nrepresentation guaranteed by Faretta v. California,422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562\n(1975). More specifically, the court must consider whether a prisoner may insist on either physical\naccess to a law library or access to non­lawyer trained legal assistance once the court offers to\nappoint a lawyer for the prisoner's case. In addition, as the provisionally certified class consists of\nboth pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners, the court will also discuss the differing rights of\nthose prisoners who have been sentenced, but remain incarcerated in the Sacramento County jails\n(either the Main Jail or RCCC).\nIV. Pro Per Pre­trial Detainees6\nDefendants  correctly  contend  that  the  extent  to  which  Bounds  creates  rights  for  pre­trial\ndetainees who assert their right of self­representation remains unsettled. Milton v. Morris,767 F.2d\n1443, 1446, n. 2 (9th Cir.1985). In Milton, a prisoner filed a federal habeas petition claiming denial of\ndue process. Petitioner had chosen to represent himself in his original criminal trial rather than\naccept appointed counsel. Petitioner went to trial without having access to research materials,\nadvisory counsel, means to serve subpoenas, or effective use of a telephone. Petitioner challenged\nhis conviction on the grounds that he had been denied the right of self­representation and the right of\nmeaningful access to the courts. The district court denied his petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed\nthe judgment of the district court and remanded with instructions to grant the petition.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the outcome of the case was determined by the Sixth Amendment\nand the Supreme Court's holding in Faretta v. California,422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d\n562 (1975). In Faretta, the Court held that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right of self­\nrepresentation which allows one to make one's own defense personally without the assistance of\ncounsel. Id. Following Faretta,  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  at  a  minimum  the  Sixth  Amendment\nguaranteed a\n[ 780 F.Supp. 1314 ]\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 4/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\npetitioner time to prepare his defense and some access to materials and witnesses which are\nfundamental to a meaningful right of representation. Milton, 767 F.2d at 1446, citing Faretta, 422 U.S.\nat 818, 95 S.Ct. at 2532. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit stated:\nWe need not determine in this case whether Bounds,430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72, which\ninvolved an unrepresented prisoner seeking collateral review of his conviction, should be interpreted as\nplacing an affirmative duty upon the state to provide a library for the defendant who has rejected the\nassistance of counsel for trial. Faretta controls this case.\nMilton, 767 F.2d at 1446.7\nThe Ninth Circuit declined to state the effect of Bounds (if any) on prisoners who are pre­trial\ndetainees declining counsel.\nThe court cannot fail to note the irony of the situation where a pre­trial detainee representing\nhimself, and who thereby has a great need for library access, will be denied that access. Plaintiffs\nargue that the pre­trial detainee is being penalized for the assertion of his Faretta rights. On the other\nhand, the state should not have to subsidize the exercise of Faretta rights with respect to library\naccess for pre­trial detainees when it already provides a more than adequate substitute. Defendants\ncontend that a county may certainly choose to give Bounds access to a law library in addition to\nappointed counsel, but it is not mandated to do so.\nTherefore, the remaining issue is whether any access to a law library is mandated by Milton,\nand if so, the parameters of that access. The Ninth Circuit has not expressed an entirely consistent\nposition on this issue. In Taylor v. List,880 F.2d 1040 (9th Cir.1989), the Ninth Circuit was faced with\na 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim by a convicted defendant that, because he had been denied access to a\nlaw library when he was representing himself, he had suffered a constitutional deprivation. Taylor\ninterpreted Milton as follows:\nWe then went on to hold that the Sixth Amendment right to self­representation recognized in Faretta\nincludes a right of access to law books, witnesses, and other tools necessary to prepare a defense.\nTaylor, 880 F.2d at 1047.\nUnder the Taylor holding, clearly some access to a law library is required for the incarcerated\npre­trial detainee. However, one year later the Ninth Circuit appeared to restrict access to a law\nlibrary when it stated:\nAs this court's decision in Wilson suggests, there is nothing constitutionally offensive about requiring a\ndefendant to choose between appointed counsel and access to legal materials; the sixth amendment is\nsatisfied by the offer of professional representation alone.\nUnited States v. Robinson, 913 F.2d 712, 717 (9th Cir.1990), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 111\nS.Ct. 1006, 112 L.Ed.2d 1089 (1991) (emphasis added).8 Harmonizing the authority, this court\nbelieves that an incarcerated pre­trial detainee is entitled to a limited, \"non­Bounds\" access to law\nbooks and other legal materials. This court also finds that the county is not obliged to facilitate non­\nlawyer legal assistance for the pre­trial detainee.\nAdditionally, the court notes that the weight of authority in other circuits that have considered this\nissue supports the court's conclusion that defendants are not mandated to supply Bounds/Toussaint\naccess to law libraries or legal assistance. United States v. Chatman,584 F.2d 1358 (4th Cir.1978)\n(to  extent  Bounds  even  applies,  state  satisfied  Bounds  with  the  offering  of  counsel  for\nrepresentation); United States ex rel. George v. Lane,718 F.2d 226, 231 (7th Cir.1983) (offer of\ncourt­appointed\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 5/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by

interplay  between  Bounds  and  Faretta  that  would  require  a  trial  court  to  permit  a  pro  se\ndefendant to have access to a law library). Although the Ninth Circuit has seemingly avoided\nexplicitly holding that the states may satisfy Faretta by offering appointed counsel only, case law\nfrom the other circuits carries some authoritative weight. Thus, to the extent that other circuits have\ndetermined that Bounds does not require the states to provide physical library access to pre­trial\ndetainees who exercise their Faretta rights, this court is persuaded.\nThe  only  remaining  issue  is  how  much  access  will  satisfy  this  court's  \"some  access\"\nrequirement.  Defendants  have  submitted  declarations  in  which  they  indicate  that  the  County\nprovides  some  access  to  legal  materials,  witnesses  and  other  tools  necessary  to  prepare  a\ndefense.9 According to the Earles declaration, the jail librarian provides a \"pro per\" information\npackage. A person representing himself also receives copies of the applicable code section(s)\nrelated to his charges and rules of court. The County also provides several information packets\npertaining to Marsden motions (ineffective assistance or conflict with counsel), habeas corpus,\nacquisition of experts, criminal motions, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions and several other areas. In order\nto obtain specific law books, the inmate submits a \"kite\" to custody staff. The request may be for\nspecific  reference  materials,  or  a  more  generalized  request  for  books  in  a  certain  legal  area.\nPersons representing themselves can obtain legal materials within a day of a request; the general\ninmate  population  can  obtain  requested  references  within  a  week.  The  law  librarian  will  also\n\"Shepardize\" the cases provided to the inmate upon request.\nPlaintiffs'  declarations  describe  this  system  as  working  more  poorly  in  practice  than  it  is\ntheoretically supposed to work. However, the court finds for the purposes of plaintiffs' interlocutory\ninjunctive relief motion, that whatever the invalidity of a paging system with respect to incarcerated\nprisoners after conviction, see Toussaint, and its inevitable breakdown in some cases, a pre­trial\ndetainee's Sixth Amendment Faretta rights are satisfactorily supplemented by the access provided\nby the County Jail personnel.\nTherefore, the court finds that although the plaintiffs have raised serious legal issues with\nrespect  to  law  library  access  for  pre­trial  detainees,  they  have  not  raised  serious  questions\nconcerning the likelihood that they will ultimately receive injunctive relief. This court has resolved the\nlegal question, and it no longer remains. There is no further development of the issue with respect to\npre­trial detainees in this case that would likely change the result.10 Accordingly,\n[ 780 F.Supp. 1316 ]\nplaintiffs' request for injunctive relief for pre­trial detainees representing themselves in their criminal\nactions is denied.\nV. Convicted Prisoners11\nTurning to the claims of the other group of plaintiffs, the convicted prisoners, Bounds clearly\napplies. Thus, in considering plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief, the court must consider whether\ndefendants have met Bounds by providing either meaningful access to an adequate law library or\nadequate assistance of persons trained in the law. First, with respect to the claims of inadequate\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 6/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\naccess  to  a  law  library,  plaintiffs  are  clearly  correct  that  a  \"paging\"  or  \"slip\"  system  alone  is\nunconstitutional. Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d at 1080 (9th Cir.1986). As no one disputes that\nthe Sacramento County Jail uses a slip system, it would appear at the threshold that the law library\nfails to provide convicted inmates with the right of access to the courts.\nAlthough  a  paging  system  alone  is  unconstitutional,  some  authority  supports  defendants'\nargument that a paging system in conjunction with legal assistance will satisfy Bounds. Williams v.\nLeeke,584 F.2d 1336 (4th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 911, 99 S.Ct. 2825, 61 L.Ed.2d 276\n(1979) (state could use paging system in conjunction with providing state­funded legal counsel or\ntrained  legal  assistants);  See  also,  Toussaint,  801  F.2d  at  1109­1110.  Defendants  attempt  to\ndistinguish their system from the Toussaint paging system by claiming that they also provide legal\nassistance to the inmates. Defendants note that one of the librarians is a certified paralegal and that\nboth librarians assist the inmates by obtaining general references, narrowing the scope of legal\ninquiries  and  providing  inmates  with  compiled  packages  of  legal  materials  and  forms.  Thus,\ndefendants contend that their system is completely different from the Toussaint system where\ninmates had to use exact citations in order to obtain legal references.\nHowever, it is questionable whether defendants have provided the necessary \"legal assistance\"\nto circumvent the unconstitutional paging system. The problems with the Toussaint paging system\nare not limited to the requirement of providing exact citations. In order to conduct meaningful legal\nresearch, prisoners must be allowed to browse through legal materials. Williams, 584 F.2d at 1339\n(legal  research  often  requires  browsing  through  various  materials  in  search  of  inspiration).\nDefendants cannot alleviate the problems of a paging system merely by providing assistance in\nlocating citations. In addition, although defendants attempt to characterize the assistance of the law\nlibrarians as \"legal assistance,\" it is unclear whether this type of assistance will satisfy Bounds.\nSee, e.g., Williams, 584 F.2d at 1339; Toussaint, 801 F.2d at 1110 (citing other circuit authority\ndefining legal assistance).\nBecause plaintiffs have raised serious, non­speculative questions concerning the constitutional\nadequacy  of  the  paging  system  for  convicted  prisoners,  the  court  will  presume  a  showing  of\nirreparable injury. However, the grant or issuance of interlocutory injunctive relief depends upon the\nbalance of hardships. Plaintiffs have not shown that the County's present system adversely affects\nmany convicted inmates. Moreover, plaintiffs' general request that this court order \"physical access\nto the law library\" is devoid of any practical specifics. Should the court order the County to initiate an\nescort system with the attendant costs associated with a security escort? Should the court order\nthe placement of the law library in a newly constructed space?12 How should a \"jailhouse lawyer\"\nlegal assistance plan be initiated? Without knowing\n[ 780 F.Supp. 1317 ]\nthe specifics of the presumptive harms entailed in the inadequate law library access claim, and\nwithout  having  finally  adjudicated  whether  the  County's  \"paging  system­plus\"  meets  the\nrequirements of Bounds/Toussaint, the court is unwilling to assess at this time the probable heavy\ncosts associated with the request for relief.\nHowever, plaintiffs also request that defendants post a listing of all legal references available in\nthe law libraries. Defendants do not assert any difficulty or hardship would arise out of posting a\ncopy of the reference materials available in the jail law library. A copy of the reference listing could\nbe conspicuously posted in the dayrooms on the several floors of the jail facility. Therefore, this\ncourt will order the placement of a copy of the listing of legal reference materials contained in the\nMain Jail and RCCC in a conspicuous place on each floor of the living areas.\nCONCLUSION\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 7/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\nIn accordance with the court's above­stated reasoning and its announcements to the parties in\nopen court, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction regarding\nlaw library access is denied, with the exception that defendants are ordered to post the lists of legal\nreference materials as stated previously.\nFootnotes\n1. Plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on September 25, 1991. In their third amended complaint plaintiffs\npurport to represent both prisoners in the Sacramento County Jail and the Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center.\nDefendants have challenged the sufficiency of this third amended complaint by filing a motion to dismiss. A hearing is\nscheduled on defendants' motion for November 21, 1991.\nBack to Reference\n2. In several of the declarations, plaintiffs raise claims concerning conditions of confinement other than law library\naccess. However, these issues are not currently before the court. Therefore, the court only considers those allegations\nrelated to law library access/legal assistance.\nBack to Reference\n3. Further, it is clear from the plaintiffs' declarations that at least some plaintiffs allege actual injury. See the declarations\nof Hamburg and Marks.\nBack to Reference\n4.  Again,  defendants  have  not  studied  plaintiffs'  declarations.  Plaintiffs  Kaiser  and  Marks  complain  about  the\ninaccessibility of jailhouse lawyers, as well as a denial of physical access to the library.\nBack to Reference\n5. The court will address defendants' arguments concerning class certification in full on November 21, 1991, when the\ncourt considers defendants' motion to dismiss.\nBack to Reference\n6. For ease of reference, the term \"pre­trial detainees\" will be used not only to encompass those persons awaiting trial,\nbut also those persons who represent themselves in criminal post­trial proceedings. With respect to the present class,\nno party contests the fact that pre­trial detainees have the right to appointed counsel for their criminal proceedings.\nBack to Reference\n7. The Milton court cited United States v. Wilson,690 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 867, 104 S.Ct. 205,\n78 L.Ed.2d 178 (1983), which defendants argue, with some merit, unequivocally decided that a pre­trial detainee who\nwas offered counsel had no right to a law library access. Milton held that Wilson was consistent with its \"some access\"\nholding.\nBack to Reference\n8. However, Robinson goes on to cite Milton for the \"some access\" requirement, which Milton derived from the Sixth\nAmendment.\nBack to Reference\n9. The Honorable William Ridgeway (Superior Court Judge) explains the County's general policy for providing\nassistance to pro per criminal defendants. Additionally, Jack Earles (law librarian) indicates that this general policy was\nfollowed for each of the plaintiffs who submitted declarations. The County's policy requires the Sacramento County Jail\nto furnish a place to prepare the defense of the case, furnish the defendant with supplies (i.e. paper, pencils, etc.), allow\nthe defendant to receive legal materials, permit the defendant to have up to ten books in his cell at one time, allow use\nof a telephone, aid defendant in subpoenaing witnesses (maximum of four), provide unlimited legal mail privileges,\nauthorize the use of an investigator, and in­jail visits with prospective witnesses.\nBack to Reference\n10. The \"serious questions\" factor in the injunctive relief analysis is more appropriately directed at questions of mixed\nfact and law. Purely legal issues, although they may be close and difficult, are usually resolved without the need for\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx 8/9\n\n6/20/12 This Document is Provided by Leagle.com\nfurther development of the record (e.g. motions to dismiss or summary judgment). Once the court makes a legal\ndetermination, the losing party does not generally have any further hope for success on that particular legal issue.\nHowever, the court, of course, is not finally ruling on the issue. If plaintiffs present evidence that the paging system works\nso poorly on an overall basis that the system does not even provide \"some access\", the matter will be revisited at time of\nfinal adjudication.\nBack to Reference\n11. \"Convicted Prisoners\" includes those persons who are potentially eligible to file habeas corpus petitions or\nparticipate in other civil actions. These persons have no right to appointed counsel.\nBack to Reference\n12. The present space is sufficient only to shelve the reference materials.\nBack to Reference\nwww.leagle.com/PrintDocument.aspx
