    "summary": "<p>On October 5, 1990, residents of public housing complexes in Chester, PA filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Chester Housing Authority (CHA) under the federal public housing law, 42 U.S.C. § 1437. The plaintiffs, represented by legal aid and private attorneys, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. They claimed that the defendants violated federal housing law, the Administrative Procedures Act, and civil rights laws, and that the defendants had breached HUD’s Annual Contributions Contract. Specifically, they claimed that CHA took action to demolish part of the Chester housing complex without meeting statutory criteria, that gross neglect and mismanagement resulted in \"de facto demolition,\" and that failure to preserve the public housing units resulted in racially discriminatory treatment. The plaintiffs contended that the CHA developments were overcrowded and unsafe; the large number of uninhabitable vacant units had prevented overcrowded families from obtaining larger units and applicant families from obtaining units at all.</p><p>This summary includes less information than usual because many of the documents for this case were not available. The summary is based on opinions, the docket, and news articles. </p><p>On October 31, 1990, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and on December 3, 1990, CHA and their executive director moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs responded to the defendants’ motion on December 13, 1990. On January 4, 1991, HUD moved to dismiss the case as well.</p><p>On March 1, 1991, Judge Norma Shapiro ordered with the consent of all parties that defendants would not enter into any contracts for the demolition of the William Penn Project, a complex managed by CHA, and or relocation of utility services prior to March 13, 1991.</p><p>Then, on March 13, 1991, the court denied without prejudice plaintiff’s motion for class certification and dismissed the complaint against CHA’s executive director. On the same day, the court denied HUD’s motion to dismiss. Further, the court set a deadline for an amended complaint.</p><p>On March 29, 1991, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for alleged violations of federal housing law, the Administrative Procedures Act, civil rights laws, and breach of HUD’s Annual Contributions Contract. The plaintiffs filed another motion for class certification, moving under Rule 23(b)(2) to certify a class of “all current and future tenants of and applicants for admission to public housing owned and operated by Defendant Chester Housing Authority.” In April 1991, the defendants filed answers to the Seconded Amended Complaint. </p><p>The court placed the case in administrative suspense and, on August 6, 1991, appointed a mediator to resolve the dispute. Yet negotiations between the parties failed and the court vacated the mediation order on December 11, 1991. </p><p>On October 25, 1991, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on grounds that the dangerous conditions threatened the lives, health, and safety of the tenants. On November 12, HUD filed a brief opposing the injunction. The court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction on November 20, 1991. Discovery proceeded into December.</p><p>On January 9, 1992, the court ordered that the plaintiff’s preliminary injunction motion was withdrawn in accordance with statements regarding eviction and rent collection. HUD had recently assumed control of CHA, designated a Troubled Housing Authority. HUD contracted with a professional management firm to manage CHA to remedy the problems. Additionally, the court placed the case on administrative suspense until October 9, 1992 so parties could complete fact finding and reach a settlement and give new management a chance to improve conditions. </p><p>During this time, defendants conducted a Needs Assessment, prepared a plan according to the requirements of HUD’s Comprehensive Grant Program regulations and implemented a plan of reconstruction and restoration. The plaintiffs remained dissatisfied and opposed their hiring an executive director without adequate input from tenants and the City. On July 31, 1992, the plaintiffs moved to restore the case to active status and for a preliminary injunction to prevent the appointment of an executive director. On September 18, 1992, HUD filed its opposition this motion. Beginning that month, the court held hearings on the plaintiff’s motion. On November 19, 1992, the court granted plaintiffs motion to restore case to active status and denied the motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the appointment of an executive director.</p><p>On December 23, 1992, the defendants filed their opposition to plaintiff’s motion for class certification. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part on February 17, 1993. 1993 WL 45989. The court found that counsel and class representatives were adequate to represent a class composed of the current tenants of public housing owned and operated by the CHA or HUD. </p><p>On April 12, 1993, HUD moved for a judgment on the pleadings which the court denied on April 15.</p><p>A bench trial began on May 3, 1993 and lasted until July 9, 1993. On April 29, 1994, Judge Shapiro issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. 850 F.Supp. 1257. The court found that the CHA and the executive director in her official capacity were liable for de facto demolition of the housing units at CHA; HUD was liable for de facto demolition at CHA as operators after November 6, 1991. The court concluded that the high number of vacancies at CHA before the HUD takeover on November 6, 1991, the policy not to rehabilitate vacant units for occupancy adopted after November 6, 1991, and vacancies during the planned modernization and phased reconstruction plans over the next four to five years constituted illegal de facto demolition by CHA. </p><p>The court dismissed as moot the allegation that CHA took action to demolish the housing units without meeting statutory criteria required by 24 U.S.C. §1437(p), because CHA withdrew proposed demolition after it received funds to invest in modernization of the project in September 1992. Further, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims under the Fair Housing Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The court dismissed the count that alleged a breach of the Annual Contributions Contract between CHA and HUD as the plaintiffs were not entitled to enforce its provisions against CHA as third party beneficiaries. Finally, the court denied HUD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as moot.</p><p>The court ordered parties to submit proposed remedies on or before May 20, 1994. On May 20, 1994, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum in support of their proposed order for relief. In response, on May 27, HUD opposed their proposed order of relief and moved for reconsideration of their liability finding on June 9, 1994.</p><p>Then, on August 31, 1994, the court appointed a receiver, Robert Rosenberg, to the CHA, which the defendants had moved for with the plaintiff’s consent.</p><p>On October 7, 1994, the plaintiffs moved for approval of a settlement between HUD and the plaintiffs. On October 24, the court denied HUD’s motion for reconsideration of liability finding but granted their motion for partial reconsideration of the basis upon which the court premised its findings of liability against the federal government. The court found that the appointment of the receiver rendered this case moot. Accordingly, the court denied as moot the plaintiff’s motion for approval of settlement and the defendants’ motion to stay consideration of the plaintiff’s motion to approve settlement agreement.</p><p>On June 9, 1995, the court appointed a master for purpose of arbitrating disputes under CHA leases. On December 20, 1995, the court appointed magistrate judge Faith Angell as an alternative or substitute to the master for the purpose of arbitrating disputes.  </p><p>In August 1996, the court granted contractors the right to proceed in contract claims against CHA. In May 1997, the court referred the case to the magistrate for a settlement conference regarding the contractors’ claims. On January 1, 1997, the court appointed a new special master regarding disputes under CHA leases.</p><p>In December 1997, individual tenants began applying for leave to file complaints against CHA.</p><p>On September 18, 2000, HUD moved to reduce compensation of court-appointed receiver. On June 12, 2002, the court granted the federal defendant’s motion to reduce compensation of court-appointed receiver in part and denied it in part. HUD had argued that the receiver’s success in the role reduced his responsibilities such that his pay was disproportionate to his duties. The court ordered the defendants to compensate the receiver at the same rate but eliminate extra expenses. 2002 WL 1292021.</p><p>The court ordered a continuance of the CHA receivership but changed the receiver’s status to Judicial Administrator for Development on March 31, 2005. In that order, the court appointed an Advisory Board of Commissioners and a CHA Executive Director. </p><p>On September 13, 2013, HUD filed a notice of appeal regarding a July 24, 2013 order granting CHA’s motion that it could include funding for the Chester Housing Police Force in its annual plan from funds pursuant to federal public housing law, §1437. USCA Case Number 13−3926. The parties reached a negotiated settlement regarding this matter. Accordingly, on October 15, 2013, the parties filed a joint motion to vacate the July 25 order. On October 17, 2013, the court ordered that the joint motion would be granted if the Court of Appeals remanded for that purpose. On November 13, 2013, the Third Circuit issued an order granting HUD’s unopposed October 18 motion to remand the matter so the trial court could grant the motion to vacate. On November 20, 2013, the court granted the parties’ joint motion to vacate that order pursuant to the terms of their negotiated settlement. </p><p>On October 11, 2013, the court appointed an alternate special master to preside over arbitration hearings and appointed Judge Phyllis Beck to preside over any appeals of dispositions filed by the special master.</p><p>The court released the CHA from federal receivership on December 31, 2014. The 2013 annual report informed this decision. The report demonstrated that the recent HUD inspections of CHA properties resulted in very high ratings, HUD had rated CHA’s Section 8 program highly, the CHA police department had significantly improved the safety and security of tenants, and the CHA Board of Commissioners received intensive training to add to their qualifications. The court also found that the Judicial Administrator performed in an excellent manner, the executive director had fulfilled his duties and requirements under all court orders, and that significant progress had been made to transform CHA into a functioning authority capable of providing decent, safe, and clean low-income housing to its tenants. </p><p>As part of that release, the court retained jurisdiction to enforce its terms and conditions related to an amended agreement ordered on June 14, 2014. There, the court had found that upon termination of the receivership, an amendatory agreement would be substituted in CHA’s dwelling lease. On August 11, 2014, the court provided for continued arbitration of claims relating to the interpretation, validity, or performance of that lease. </p><p>On January 26, 2018, the case was reassigned to Judge Cynthia Rufe. The case is ongoing.</p>",

After describing the status of the court proceedings, \nSmerconish stated in his October, 1991 memorandum that: “In order to avoid a full court hearing and the possibility of the Court\nappointing a receiver, the Department needs to have a plan of action by the end of the month.... Failure to take any action would \ncreate a policy void which would permit Judge Shapiro to make decisions and policy for the Department.” A.R. at 20399. \n \n3  There was also no evidence on the number of children at the CHA projects who had been tested. \n \n4  42 U.S.C. § 1983 states in relevant part: \nEvery person who, under color of statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be\nsubjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in \nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress. \n \n5  See also Henry Horner Mothers Guild, 780 F.Supp. at 514–15; Concerned Tenants Ass’n of Father Panik Village, 685 F.Supp. at \n320–21 (de facto demolition need not require razing); Tinsley, 750 F.Supp. at 1007–08. HUD’s regulatory definition of demolition \nwas not discussed in these de facto demolition cases. But see Dessin v. Housing Auth. of Ft. Myers, 783 F.Supp. 587, 590 \n(M.D.Fla.1990) (rejecting a claim of de facto demolition by relying on HUD’s definition of demolition and on the “plain meaning”\nof the term), vacated in part and rev’d in part, 948 F.2d 730 (11th Cir.1991). \n \n6  HUD argues that certain clauses of the ACC would be rendered meaningless if CHA ceased to exist when HUD exercises its \npowers after a default or breach of the ACC. For instance, § 505(C) states that any indebtedness of CHA to the Government was \nnot abrogated by a HUD takeover of CHA; § 503(A) states that the Government would redeliver possession of the projects to CHA \nafter it found that all defaults and breaches were cured or after the Government was no longer obligated to make annual \ncontributions available to CHA. A.R. at 24282, 24280. While these ACC clauses may demonstrate an attempt to preserve CHA as \na legal entity for financial purposes during the HUD takeover, they do not clarify the legal consequences of HUD’s operation of the \nhousing units after a HUD takeover. \n \n7  However, plaintiffs need not show that CHA or HUD intended to de facto demolish housing units. Neither the statute nor the\nlegislative history explicitly require a “plan” or an intent to demolish. See Henry Horner Mothers Guild v. Chicago Hous. Auth.,\n824 F.Supp. 808, 818–19 (N.D.Ill.1993) (intent is not a necessary element of a claim under § 1437p(d)). But see Gomez v. Housing \nAuth. of El Paso, 805 F.Supp. 1363, 1375–76 (W.D.Tex.1992) (requiring plaintiffs to show that the housing authority has a \n“policy” or that the housing authority “purposely allowed ... units to become uninhabitable or violated HUD regulations”). \nSubsection 1437p(b)(3) prohibits HUD from approving demolition or disposition of public housing units unless the PHA has a plan \nto provide an additional public housing unit for each unit it seeks to demolish. The clear intent of this subsection is to prevent any \nreduction in available public housing units. It applies when a PHA intentionally removes housing units from service and when a \nPHA unintentionally allows conditions to deteriorate so that the housing units are functionally unavailable. Allowing the removal \n \n\n \nof available public housing units through inadvertent or deliberate neglect violates the congressional directive to maintain the \nnumber of available units. \n \n8  It is unclear whether the units in Chester Towers, McCaffery Village, and Lamokin Village will be vacant until the end of the \napproximately six-year modernization programs or whether some repairs are contemplated without need for a high vacancy rate at \nthose developments. \n \n9  This is with the possible exception of Chester Towers, which appeared to be in better condition than the other developments. \n \n10  The court does not reach the question of whether the occupied units could have been considered functionally or de facto \ndemolished if CHA/HUD had failed to take action to halt the physical deterioration of those units. \n \n11  This portion of the contract appears to apply to development of projects within a PHA rather than to its maintenance and operation; \nbut even to the extent that this section directly benefits the plaintiffs, it does not affect the analysis of plaintiffs’ right to recover \nunder the ACC as third party beneficiaries. \n \n12  It is unlikely that Congress intended to create a federal warranty of habitability for HUD-financed housing. See Gibson v. Gary \nHous. Auth., 754 F.2d 205, 206 (7th Cir.1985) (no warranty of habitability for HUD-regulated and subsidized housing); Alexander \nv. United States Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., 555 F.2d 166, 171 (7th Cir.1977) (no warranty of habitability for HUD-owned \nhousing), aff’d, 441 U.S. 39, 99 S.Ct. 1572, 60 L.Ed.2d 28 (1979); Perez v. United States, 594 F.2d 280, 287 & n. 11 (1st Cir.1979)\n(no affirmative statutory duty on HUD to guarantee safety of HUD-financed housing); Hurt v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth., 806 \nF.Supp.  515,  527  (E.D.Pa.1992);  Kingston  Square  Tenants  Ass’n  v.  Tuskegee  Gardens,  Ltd.,  792  F.Supp.  1566,  1574 \n(S.D.Fla.1992). Some courts have allowed tenants to seek equitable relief against HUD on a theory of an implied warranty of \nhabitability; in these cases, however, HUD either owned the projects or was the mortgagee in possession of the property. See \nConille v. Secretary of Hous. and Urban Dev., 840 F.2d 105, 113–17 (1st Cir.1988); Chase v. Theodore Mayer Bros., 592 F.Supp. \n90, 100–01 (S.D.Ohio 1983); Techer v. Roberts–Harris, 83 F.R.D. 124 (D.Conn.1979). \n \n13  See also Hurt v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth., 806 F.Supp. 515, 524–27 (E.D.Pa.1992) (discussing the distinction between precatory \npolicy language and specific substantive language creating enforceable rights). ACC provisions relating to “decent, safe, and \nsanitary housing,” “the economic and social well-being of the tenants,” and the maintenance of “each Project in good repair, order, \nand condition” were not intended by Congress to bring landlord-tenant disputes into federal court. \n \n14  Federal courts have divided over this issue. In Perry v. Housing Auth. of Charleston, 664 F.2d 1210, 1218, 1218 n. 16 (4th \nCir.1981) the court found that tenants were not third party beneficiaries of the ACC, and disposed of the issue without remanding \nto the district court. See also Kingston Square Tenants Ass’n v. Tuskegee Gardens, Ltd., 792 F.Supp. 1566, 1573 (S.D.Fla.1992); \nBoston Public Hous. Tenants’ Policy Council, Inc. v. Lynn, 388 F.Supp. 493 (D.Mass.1974). But the Circuit Court for the District \nof Columbia in Ashton v. Pierce, 716 F.2d 56, 66 (D.C.Cir.1983) found third party beneficiary status and stated that “it is difficult \nto imagine any purpose for the Contract other than to benefit the tenants of public housing.” See also Henry Horner Mothers Guild \nv.

CIVIL  ACTION \nv . \nMEL  MARTINEZ,  SECRETARY  OF  HOUSING \n& URBAN  DEVELOPMENT,  in  his \nofficial  capacity,'  et  al .  NO.  90-6449 \nMEMORANDUM  AND  ORDER \nNorma  L.  Shapiro,  S.J .  June  12,  2002 \nIn  June,  1994,  this  court  granted  the  motion  of  the \nDepartment  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (\"HUD\")  for  the \nappointment  of  a  Receiver  over  the  Chester  Housing  Authority \n(\"CHA\") .

In  August  of  that  year,  the  court \nselected  Robert  Rosenberg  (\"Rosenberg\"  or  \"the  Receiver\")  to \nserve  as  CHA' s  Receiver .  Order,  August  31,  1994  (#212) \nRosenberg  was  empowered  to : \n(Hlold,  protect,  and  preserve,  manage  and  control  all \npresent  and  after-acquired  real  and  personal  property \nof  CHA,  including  but  not  limited  to  financial \nmanagement,  applicant  intake  and  placement,  general \nmanagement  and  maintenance,  contract  administration, \nmodernization,  lease  enforcement,  resident  relations, \nand  rehabilitation  functions .  The  Receiver  shall \nrebuild  CHA's  capacity  to  manage  and  oversee  its public \n'Mel  Martinez  is  substituted  for  his  predecessors  as  the \nSecretary  for  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development . \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P .  2Sld) (1) . \n1 \n\nhousing  programs  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and \nregulations . \nWithout  objection  from  the  federal  defendants,  the  court \nestablished  a  fixed-fee  system  to  compensate  the  Receiver :  $40 . 00 \nper  unit  per month  (\"p/u/m\") ,  plus  $5, 000  per month  for  expenses \nincurred.1 \nSix years  later,  although  acknowledging  that  the  Receiver \nhas  \"successfully  rebuilt\"  CHA' s  capacity  to  manage  itself \nthrough  his  \"remarkable  effort, \"  the  federal  defendants  move  to \nreduce  his  compensation  to  $23 .34  p/u/m,  with  a  maximum \ncompensation  of  $405, 020  a  year .  They  argue  the  Receiver' s \nsuccesses  have  so  reduced  his  responsibilities  that  his  pay  is \ndisproportionate  to  his  duties . \nI .  FACTUAL  BACKGROUND \nCHA  administers  five  separate  housing  projects .  This  action \nwas  filed  by  a  class  of  tenants  alleging  CHA's  inability to \nprovide  them  with  safe  and  sanitary housing .  In  1991,  while  the \nparties  were  mediating  a  settlement,  HUD  assumed  oversight  over \nCHA  as  a  \"troubled  agency\"  subject  to  federal  control .  Despite \nthis  takeover,  HUD  was  unable  to  effect  substantive  change  in \nlThe  Court  later authorized  an  eight  percent  (8%)  cost-of \nliving  increase  in  the  Receiver' s  per  unit  compensation,  to \n$43 .20  per  unit .  The  Receiver' s  allotted expenses  were  reduced \nto  $2 ,500  a  month. \n2 \n\nCHA' s  operations .  In  1994,  after hol ding  a  bench  trial ,  the \ncourt  concl uded : \nThe  high  number  of  vacancies  at  CHA  before  the  HUD \ntakeover  of  November  6,  1991,  the  pol icy not  to \nrehabil itate  vacant  units  for  occupancy  adopted  after \nNovember  6,  1991,  and  vacancies  planned  during  the \nplanned  modernization  and  phased  reconstruction  plans \nover  the  next  four  to  five  years  constitute  i llegal  de \nfacto  demol ition by  CHA.  Velez  v .  Ci sneros,  850  F. \nSupp.  1257,  1278  IE .D.  Pa.  1994) \nThe  parties  were  invited  to  submit  a  proposed  remedy.  The \ndefendants,  with  the  plaintiffs '  consent,  moved  for  the \nappointment  of  a  Receiver .  Robert  Rosenberg  was  selected  by  the \ncourt . \nIn  the  beginning  of  the  Receivership,  defendants  agreed  the \nReceiver' s  private  firm  initially  woul d  provide  much  of  the  day-\nto-day  management  of  CHA:  he  woul d  pay  the  managers  himsel f ,  and \nwoul d  be  compensated  through  the  fixed  fee  arrangement .  The \ndefendants  understood  and  agreed  that  the  fixed-fee  woul d  not \nfully  compensate  the  Receiver  at  first :  onl y  if he  were  abl e  to \nreduce  CHA' s  dependence  on  his  managers  woul d  he  later make  a \nreasonabl e  profit .  See  Tr.  Jan .  29,  2001,  at  44 . \nHUD' s  Publ ic  Housing  Assessment  System  (\"PHAS\")  is  the \nofficial  gauge  of  the  performance  of  housing  authorities \nnationwide .  At  the  creation  of  the  Receivership,  in  1994 ,  CHA \nhad  a  PHAS  score  of  35  (a  distressed  agency) ;  in  2002,  CHA \nreceived  a  score  of  91  (a  high  performer) . \nDespite  this  objective  measure  of  the  Receiver' s  efficiency \n3 \n\nand  success,  his  pay  has  been  reduced  as  the  number  of  occupied \nunits  he  oversees  has  decreased .  The  Receiver  did  not  object  to \nthese  reductions ,  as  they  were  consistent  with  the  parties' \nagreement  at  the  beginning  of  the  Receivership .  In  1997,  the \nReceiver' s  compensation  (without  expenses)  fell  from  $819,360  to \n$761,280  as  the  number  of  units  declined  from  1,707  to  1,587 .  In \n1999,  his  compensation  was  decreased  again,  to  $749,606 .40 .  In \nJanuary,  2002,  after  this  Motion  was  filed  and  argued,  the \nReceiver' s  compensation  was  reduced  again  to  $645,926 .40  to \n2 \nreflect  declining  housing  stock. Over  the  course  of  the \nReceivership,  his  annual  expense  allowance  has  been  reduced  by \nhalf,  to  $30,000 . \nIn  2000,  the  HUD  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  (\"HUD-\nOIG\") ,  initiating an  inquiry  into  the  Receivership,  recommended \nthat  HUD  petition  the  Court  for  a  reduction  in  the  Receiver' s  fee \nas  a  result  of  a  \"substantial  shift  in  the  level  of  services, \nfrom  the  Receiver  and  his  temporary  staff  to  the  CRA  and  its \npermanent  staff .\"  The  present  motion  would  cap  the  Receiver' s \n4 \nfee  at  $405,020  a  year, 3  with  a  revised  rate  of  $23 .34  p/u/m.\n2There  are  currently  1246  units . \n3The  federal  defendants  arrived  at  a  fixed  ceiling  for \ncompensation  by  reducing  the  Receiver' s  original  compensation  by \n$410,280  (currently paid  by  CHA  to  its managers) . \n4The  defendants  divided  their  proposed  cap  by  the  then  total \nnumber  of  units  to  arrive  at  a  unit  fee  of  $23 .34/month. \n4 \n\nAs  applied  to  CHA' s  current  housing  stock,  the  Receiver's \ncompensation  would  decrease  to  $348,979 .68 . \nThe  Receiver  (and  the  plaintiffs) S oppose  the  defendants' \nmotion .  According  to  the  Receiver,  his  staff  did  not  occupy  the \nmajority of  those  CHA  positions  now  filled  by  CHA  employees .  His \nduties  and  commitment  to  CHA  have  not  significantly decreased \nover  time .  The  nature  of  the  Receiver' s  role  has  changed;  he  now \nfocuses  on  long  term  planning  and  economic  development,  as  well \nas  a  sustainability program,  designed  to  protect  the  gains \nrealized  by  CHA  during  the  Receivership .  The  parties  and  the \ncourt  expect  the  Receivership  to  terminate  in  June,  2003 . \nII .  DISCUSSION \nA.  The  Court ' s  Power  to  Set  the  Receiver' s  Compensation  is \nNot  Subject  to  HUD' s  Approval \nWhen  the  Receivership  was  established,  CHA  became  the \ntemporary  property of  the  court .  The  appointing  court,  has \ncomplete,  if not  exclusive,  control  over  both  the  Receiver  and \nCHA.  Taylor v .  Sternberg ,  293  U.S.  470,  472  (1935)  (property \n~ \nreceiver  controls  is  property of  court  during  pendency  of \nreceivership);  United  States  v .  Stephens,  208  F.2d  105,  107  (5th \nCir.  1954)  (stating  that  receiver  is  officer of  appointing \nS  Plaintiffs  acknowledged  that  they  lacked  standing  to \nobject,  but  hoped  to  inform  the  court ' s  deliberation .  Their \ncomments  were  appreciated . \n5 \n\ncourt);  United  States  v .  Wayne  County  Dep't  of  Health-Air \nPollution  Control  Div.,  571  F.  Supp.  90,  92  (E.D.  Mich .  1983) \n(court  which  imposes  receivership  has  supervisory  control  over \nthose  who  administer  it) . \nThe  power  to  control  the  Receiver  impl ies  the  power  to  set \nhis  compensation,  within  reasonable  l imits .  As  the  Supreme  Court \nstated: \nNor  is  there  any  doubt  of  the  power  of  courts  of  equity \nto  fix  the  compensation  of  their own  receivers .  That \npower  resul ts  necessaril y  from  the  relation  which  the \nreceiver  sustains  to  the  court;  and,  in  the  absence  of \nany  legislation  regulating  the  receiver ' s  salary or \ncompensation,  the  matter  is  left entirel y  to  the \ndetermination  of  the  court  from  which  he  derives  his \nappointment .  The  compensation  is  usually  determined \naccording  to  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  case, \nand  corresponds  with  the  degree  of  responsibil ity and \nbusiness  abil ity required  in  the  management  of  the \naffairs  intrusted  to  him,  and  the  perplexity and \ndifficul ty  involved  in  that  management . \nStuart  v .  Boul ware,  133  U.S.  78,  10  S.Ct .  242,  33  L.Ed .  568 \n(1890) ;  see  a l so  Little  Earth  of  the  United  Tribes.  Inc .  v .  HUD, \n807  F.2d  1433,  1443  (8th Cir.  1986)  (\"the  appointing  court  has \nnot  onl y  the  authority but  a l so  wide  discretion  to  determine  who \nshall bear  the  costs  of  the  receivership\") ;  2  R.  Clark,  Treatise \non  the  Law  &  Practice  of  Receivers  §  641 (a )  (1969  supp. )  (\"the \ncourt  shoul d  consider  the  \"labor  and  acts  involved,  the  prices \nusually  paid  for  similar  services  in  connection  with  a  particular \nkind  of  business,  a l so  the  magnitude  of  the  case,  and  the  amount \nreal ized\"  (internal  citation omitted))  Here,  42  U.S.C.  §§ \n6 \n\n1437d(j) (3) (A)  (ii), (C),  the  underlying  statute,  provides  no \nguidance  to  fix  the  amount  of  the  Receiver' s  compensation:  it has \nbeen  left  to  the  court ' s  reasoned  discretion . \nAs  the  Receiver' s  compensation  is  left  to  the  court ' s \ndiscretion,  the  defendants  have  no  fixed  legal  entitlement  to \n6 \nreduced  compensation. However,  because  the  court ' s  duty  to \nmaintain  the  Receiver' s  compensation  at  a  reasonabl e  level  is \ncontinuing,  HUD' s  motion  is  not  frivol ous . \nB.  The  Receiver' s  Compensation  Remains  Reasonabl y  Related \nto  His  Responsibil ities \nEven  if  the  federal  defendants '  premise  (that  CHA  has \ndirectl y  assumed  many  of  the  responsibil ities once  hel d  by  the \nReceiver)  were  accepted,  the  Receiver' s  compensation  woul d  still \nbe  reasonabl e .  The  Receiver'  2001-2002  Report  i llustrates  the \nwide  scope  of  his  new  responsibil ities :  devel oping  a  positive \nworking  relationship  with  CHA' s  resident  leadership;  appl ying  for \ngrants  and  tax  credits;7 managing  and  inspiring  economic \n6This  l imited  authority over  the  Receiver' s  compensation  is \ncontrasted  to  the  wide  authori ty HUD  retai ns  to  audi t  CHA' s \nf i nances  and  to  measure  its performance . \n7Through  the  Receiver' s  efforts,  CHA  has  received  two  Hope \nVI  federal  grants  duri ng  the  Receivershi p .  These  grants, \ncomplemented  by  addi t i onal  public  and  private  fundi ng,  i nfused \nover  s i xty  (60)  million  dollars  i nto  CHA  and  the  Ci ty of  Chester. \n7 \n\ndevelopment  in  the  surrounding  community;S recruiting  a  permanent \nboard;  marketing;  creating  and  managing  an  effective  police \nforce;  developing  a  new  financial  structure  that  complies  with \nHUD  guidelines;  and  planning  for  the  termination  of  the \n9 \nReceivership .  The  work  involved  is  highly  complex,  and  util izes \nall the  Receiver' s  formidabl e  administrative,  pol itical , \neconomic,  legal  and  social  skills .  Whil e  it may  be  true  that  the \nReceiver  (or  surrogates  he  empl oys)  makes  a  smaller  proportion  of \nCHA' s  dail y  management  decisions,  his  rol e  in  ensuring  a  bright \nfuture  for  CHA  is  still critical  and  central . \nAs  noted  at  oral  argument,  \"it seems  a  pecul iar  reward  for \nsomeone  who  has  suffered  through  the  bad  days  to  have  his \ncompensation  reduced  when,  by  his  efforts,  he  finally  makes  a \nsuccess  of  something.  That  isn' t  usually  the  way  the  American \nsystem  works .\"  Tr.  Jan .  29,  2001,  at  45  (statement  of  the \ncourt) .  The  Receiver,  having  a l most  completed  his  onerous \nSFor  example,  the  Receiver  engaged  Kramont  Real ty Trust  to \ndevel op  a  shopping  center  near  the  Authority.  The  center  will \nprovide  consumer  outlets  for  tenants  as  well as  empl oyment \nopportunities .  The  Receiver  is  responsibl e  for  supervising  the \nlegal  and  economic  aspects  of  this  devel opment  program.  He  has \na l so  created  a  \"One  Stop  Shop\"  in  CHA  to  spur  resident  empl oyment \nand  community-wide  economic  devel opment . \n9For  example,  in  2001  the  Receiver  convened  a \n\"sustainabil ity retreat\"  to  commence  a  planning  process  to \nsustain  CHA' s  existing  programs  upon  termination  of  the \nReceivership .  He  formed  a  thirty-three  (33)  member \nSustainabil ity Committee,  which  commenced  regular  meetings  in \nSeptember,  2001. \n8 \n\nremedial  tasks,  now  focuses  his  efforts  on  preserving  and \nbuilding  on  CHA' s  transformation  whil e  earning  a  reasonable \nprofit .  After  consideration  of  all  the  evidence,  the  Receiver' s \ncurrent  unit  rate  ($43 .20  p/u/m)  is  reasonable,  and  no  absol ute \ncap  is  needed . \nHowever,  the  Receiver' s  monthl y  expense  allowance  of  $2,500 \nis  no  l onger  necessary.  This  allowance  was  originally  created  to \nhel p  defray  the  costs  of  the  Receiver' s  empl oyees  who  commuted \nto,  and  temporaril y  l ived  near,  the  Authority.  As  the  Receiver' s \nrol e  has  changed,  these  needs  have  abated,  and  the  review  of  the \nReceiver' s  expenses  has  become  increasingl y  burdensome  for  the \ncourt . \nIII .  CONCLUSION \nThe  defendants '  motion  to  reduce  the  Receiver' s  compensation \nwill be  denied  in  part  and  granted  in  part :  the  Receiver  will \ncontinue  to  be  compensated  at  $43 .20  p/ u/ m until  further  order  of \nthe  court,  but  he  no  l onger  will receive  $2,500  per  month  in \nextra expenses . \n9 \n\nIN  THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT \nFOR  THE  EASTERN  DISTRICT  OF  PENNSYLVANIA \nCARMELIA  VELEZ,  et  al.

The court appointed Steven A. Fischer as CHA Executive\nDirector on April 1, 2005.\ng. The court, by Orders dated: September 29, 2008; October 2, 2008;\nSeptember 23, 2009; April 20, 2010; November 17, 2010; December 22,\n2011; March 29, 2012; December 26, 2012; March 21, 2013; June 30,\n2013; and September 30, 2013, amended the responsibilities of Robert C.\nRosenberg, Esq., and extended his term to December 31, 2013.\nh.

The recent round of HUD inspections of CHA properties (nine total\ninspections) resulted in very high ratings (averaging 95%). \no. The CHA Section 8 program has been rated a high performer by HUD for\nseven years; this year’s rating was 93%.\np. The CHA Police Department has performed in an excellent manner and,\ntogether with the Chester Police Department, has significantly improved\nthe safety and security of CHA tenants and properties.\nq. The CHA has been recognized by its insurance company for a low loss\nratio because its properties have been kept in safe condition with few\naccident claims.\nr. The CHA Executive Director and General Counsel both serve on national\nindustry boards.  Mr. Fischer has chaired the Public Housing Authorities\nLegislative Committee the past three years and Ms. Zissimos sits on the\nHousing Authority Insurance Finance Committee.\ns. The CHA Board of Commissioners received intensive training this year to\nadd to their credentials and qualifications to oversee a Housing Authority. \nt. The court finds that terminating the Receivership is fair, adequate, and\nreasonable:  (i) the JAD has performed in an excellent manner and\nsatisfactorily concluded his duties, responsibilities, and requirements\nunder all orders of the court; (ii) the Executive Director has also\nperformed in an excellent manner and satisfactorily fulfilled his duties,\nresponsibilities, and requirements under all orders of the court; and (iii)\nsignificant progress has been made to transform CHA into a functioning\nhousing authority providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings to\nfamilies of low income, in substantial compliance with all applicable laws\nand regulations.\nu. The court finds that the Receivership should terminate, and the\ngovernance of CHA returned to a duly constituted Board of\n-3-\n\nCase 2:90-cv-06449-CMR   Document 1053   Filed 12/31/14   Page 4 of 4\nCommissioners according to law.\nIt is therefore ORDERED that:\n1.
