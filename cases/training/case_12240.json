    "summary": "<p>The Boston School Desegregation Cases predate PACER and span more than twenty years. The following summary is derived from various court opinions and news sources.</p><p>On March 15, 1972, several black parents filed this lawsuit on behalf of their children in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The children were all students in the Boston Public Schools. The plaintiffs sued the Boston School Committee and the Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools (‘the city defendants’) and the Board of Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, its individual members, and the Commissioner of Education (‘the state defendants’) under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and 2000d (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). Plaintiffs, who initially appeared pro se (on their own behalf, without counsel), sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants denied black children both equal protection of the laws and equality of educational opportunity in violation of their Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p><p>Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the city defendants “intentionally brought about and maintained racial segregation in the Boston public schools” and “engaged in racial discrimination with respect to the hiring and assignment of faculty and staff.” They also alleged that both the city defendants and the state defendants implemented discriminatory practices in admissions and maintained a pattern of lower instructional expenditures in schools attended disproportionately by black children. </p><p>The plaintiffs’ case was the culmination of a number of events and a heightened tension in the Boston metropolitan area generally. In April 1965, the State Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education studied racial segregation in the public schools of MA. They released a report (the Kiernan Report) concluding that racial imbalance was harmful and should be eliminated. The Report also identified forty-five racially imbalanced schools in Boston alone. In response, in August 1965, the Massachusetts state legislature enacted the Racial Imbalance Act of 1965. As part of the Racial Imbalance Plan, the city built several new schools, but made little to no effort to integrate them. In a separate action before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the highest court in Massachusetts), the court ordered the city defendants, in the 1974-75 school year, to implement a plan formulated by the state defendants (the ‘state plan’).</p><p>In this case, on June 21, 1974, Judge Arthur Garrity issued a 150-page opinion examining the defendants’ actions in primarily six areas: 1. Facilities utilization and new structures, 2. Districting and redistricting, 3. Feeder patterns, 4. Open enrollment and controlled transfers, 5. Faculty and staff, and 6. Vocational and examination schools. Judge Garrity found that in categories 1-4 the defendants intentionally created, maintained, promoted, and perpetuated racial segregation. For categories 5-6, Judge Garrity found a presumptive discriminatory intent by the school based on the segregation evident in the faculty among the city’s high schools. (This finding was authorized by the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 207-11 (1973), allowing for such findings where school segregation was evident). Judge Garrity then ordered the city defendants to “eliminate every form of racial segregation in the public schools of Boston, including all consequences and vestiges of segregation previously practiced by the defendants.” Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F.Supp. 410, 484 (D.Mass. 1974). He also ordered the city defendants to comply with the state plan.</p><p>The city defendants appealed the District Court’s ruling with regard to categories five and six, disputing the conclusion that present segregation had been intentional. They claimed, instead, that they were operating a neutral system, with no affirmative acts taken to either promote or obstruct preexisting segregation. In December 1974, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s findings: Judge Frank Coffin’s opinion held that ‘the defendants’ failures to act are probative evidence of intent.’ Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580, 585 (1st Cir. 1975). The case was remanded for implementation of an appropriate plan.</p><p>On July 31, 1974, Judge Garrity issued orders on a faculty desegregation plan. The plan set a goal to reduce the concentration of black teachers in black schools and increase the number of experienced teachers in predominantly black schools. It also required the hiring of 280 new permanent teachers hired at a one-to-one rate black/white until “all available qualified blacks had been hired.” The plan set a 20% goal for the hiring of black faculty members (which was less than the 35% of black students in Boston Public Schools). The plan as set forth by Judge Garrity faced several challenges by the teacher’s union, on appeal, each of which was rejected by the First Circuit. On January 28, 1975, the Court of Appeals (Coffin, J.) held that Judge Garrity’s use of percentages to eliminate racial segregation was acceptable and even increased the District Court’s goal of 20% black faculty to 25%.</p><p>In response to the court orders and the increased desegregation efforts, the start of the 1974 school year was marred by <a href=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/06/boston-busing-crisis-years-later/DS35nsuqp0yh8f1q9aRQUL/story.html>violence</a> in the city of Boston. The Mayor of Boston, Kevin White, requested federal assistance to restore order, but his request was initially denied. Violence continued to plague the city throughout the school year, such that at the start of the 1975 school year Mayor White deployed over <a href=http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_DAAGMUUEVIH0JAR>3,000 personnel</a> to ensure a peaceful start to the year.</p><p>In January of 1975, both parties submitted alternatives to the state plan. Due to the technical complexities of the plans, Judge Garrity appointed a panel of four special masters and two experts to assist the court in adopting a desegregation plan for the 1975 school year. The masters submitted a plan in March, 1975 which was opposed by both the plaintiffs and the defendants. On June 5, 1975, Judge Garrity rejected the parties’ objection to the masters’ plan and after some revisions, the masters’ plan was implemented. The defendants, as well as various intervening parties including a parent association, attempted to prevent the implementation of the plan and proposed alternative plans. These attempts were ultimately futile.</p><p>In 1977 and 1978, Judge Garrity ordered the city and state defendants to submit a “Unified Facilities Plan” (UFP) to outline a path for the renovation of all nine school districts and also to close several schools. School and parent associations objected to the plans to close schools, but both the District Court and the First Circuit found for the defendants. Morgan v. McDonough, 689 F.2d 265, 269-70 (1st Cir. 1982)</p><p>On December 23, 1982, Judge Garrity declared a desire for party autonomy and voluntary fulfillment of the previous court orders. He outlined four necessary mechanisms to be determined in order to phase out court involvement in the desegregation process: monitoring compliance, dispute resolution, judicial authority should voluntary efforts fail, and procedures governing modification or outstanding orders. Morgan v. McDonough, 554 F.Supp. 169 (D.Mass. 1982). On July 5, 1985 after some negotiation of the measures, Judge Garrity, found that the parties had “developed a common understanding of their respective rights and responsibilities under the remedial plan.”  Morgan v. Nucci, 612 F.Supp. 1060, 1063-64 (D.Mass. 1985). This judgment effectively granted control of future desegregation efforts to the parties.</p><p>On September 3, 1985, Judge Garrity adopted the final UFP of the parties, which was filed March 25, 1985 to outline a development plan to upgrade and improve the facilities at a large number of Boston area schools. </p><p>After the entry of the final UFP, Judge Garrity issued a final faculty plan on May 31, 1990 that required schools to maintain 25% black faculty and 10% other minority faculty until such a time that a “3% or more” reduction in force would not change the racial composition of the faculty. This order was appealed by the Boston Teachers Union. On February 21, 1991, Judge Coffin held that Judge Garrity’s order was not an impermissibly perpetual order but removed the ‘or more’ language. </p><p>On January 31, 1996, after “bringing this litigation to a successful conclusion,” plaintiffs sought and were granted attorney’s fees.</p><p>The earlier stages of the Boston desegregation cases were chronicled in <i>Simple Justice</i>, written by Richard Kluger.</p><p></p><p>Morgan v. Gittens, 915 F.Supp. 457 (D.Mass. 1996)</p><p>Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F.Supp. 410 (D.Mass. 1974)</p><p>Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580 (1st Cir. 1974)</p><p>Morgan v.

The district court \nwas then at work on the \"remedy phase,\" having already \nfound that the Boston School Committee and co-\ndefendants had unconstitutionally segregated the city's \npublic school system. Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F.Supp. \n410 (D.Mass.), aff'd, Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580 \n(1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 963, 95 S.Ct. 1950, 44 \nL.Ed.2d 449 (1975).\nBHSA's 1974 motion to intervene came on the heels of \n3\na court order directing the creation of new, so-called \nracial-ethnic parents councils and a Citywide Parents \nAdvisory Council (\"CPAC\") to coordinate them. In the \nmotion, BHSA relied both on clause (a), intervention of \nright, and clause (b), permissive intervention, of \nFed.R.Civ.P. 24. It contended that, without intervenor \nstatus, it could not speak out properly on \"matters of \ninterest to tens of thousands of Boston parents.\" BHSA \nconcluded the statement which accompanied its motion \nto intervene by saying that \"the interests of the \nAssociation and its members cannot possibly be, as a \npractical matter, 'adequately represented by existing \nparties.' \"\nWhen it allowed BHSA's original motion, the court did \n4\nnot say whether it did so of right or permissively. The \ncourt simply \"granted\" the motion and made \nintervention \"subject to the following conditions\":\n1. Intervention is granted only as to the issues related \n5\nto desegregation of students and the formulation of a \nstudent desegregation plan. The Association may \ncontinue to participate as amicus curiae as to other \nissues.\n2. The Association shall not reopen any question or \nissue which has been decided previously by the court, \nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 3 of 10\nincluding the findings of fact and conclusions of law in \n6\nthe court's opinion of June 21, 1974.\n« up\n3. The Association will not file counterclaims, \n7\nimpleaders or cross-claims, or seek the joinder of \nadditional parties or the dismissal of present parties, \nexcept by leave of court.\n4. As appropriate, the court retains the power to add to \n8\nor modify the conditions of intervention.\nBHSA thereafter participated actively in the school \n9\ncase, frequently taking the position that while \ndesegregation was needed, the district court's remedies \nwere extreme.\nOn May 29, 1981, more than six years after it had \n10\nintervened, BHSA joined with the Boston School \nCommittee in a motion requesting the district court to \nend its jurisdiction over student assignments on the \nground that maximum practicable compliance with the \ncourt's desegregation orders had by then been achieved. \nThe court has not acted on that motion.\nOn December 23, 1982, following fruitless efforts to \n11\nnegotiate a consent decree terminating or lessening court \ninvolvement, the district court issued the so-called \nMemorandum and Orders of Disengagement (the \n\"disengagement orders\"). The court announced therein \nthat substantive orders entered throughout the life of the \ncase, e.g., standards for student assignments and \ntransfers, the assignment of teachers and staff, student \ntransportation and discipline, and parent participation, \namong many others, were all to remain in place. \nHowever, the court also announced that the state board \nof education was to replace the court as a primary \n\"mechanism of administration\" for monitoring \ncompliance with these orders.\nIn the part of the disengagement orders that is the \n12\nsubject of the present appeal, the district court dismissed \nBHSA from the case, stating as follows:\nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 4 of 10\nBHSA is dismissed as an intervening party in this case, \n13\nthe school committee having recognized the Citywide \n« up\nParents Council (CPC) as the representative of \"the \nconcerns of all parent groups\" in this litigation. BHSA \nmay continue to participate as amicus curiae regarding \nmodifications of outstanding orders pursuant to Sec. VI, \nand particularly regarding beacon and linkage proposals \n\"should they be introduced by the defendants\" or other \nprincipal parties. See Morgan v. McDonough, 689 F.2d \n3\n265 at p. 280.\n3 The court finds that BHSA has no remaining legal \n14\ninterest regarding administration or modification of \norders in this case. Indeed, the duration and extent of \nBHSA's participation in this case have significantly \nexceeded the court's intentions at the time BHSA was \ngranted status as an intervening party. With respect to \nthe interests of parents and school personnel, its \nparticipation has become redundant.\n554 F.Supp. at 174 & n. 3. Of several intervenors, \n15\nBHSA was the only one to be dismissed altogether. \nHowever, other intervenors were limited as to the issues \non which their status as intervening parties would be \nrecognized. The Boston Teachers Union and Concerned \nBlack Educators of Boston were limited as intervenors to \nmatters concerning teacher hiring, transfer and \npromotion; and the Boston Association of School \nAdministrators and Supervisors was limited to the rights \nof headmasters, principals and other supervisory \npersonnel. Only El Comite de Padres Pro Defensa de la \nEducation Bilingue (\"El Comite\") continued to retain full \nparty status under the disengagement orders.\nBHSA argues that it had originally intervened of right \n16\nunder Rule 24(a), and therefore the court lacked the \npower to dismiss it from the case. To intervene of right \nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a),\n1. The applicant must claim an interest relating to the \n17\nproperty or transaction which is the subject of the action;\nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 5 of 10\n2. disposition of the action must threaten to impair or \n18\nimpede his ability to protect that interest; and\n« up\n3. the applicant's interest must not be adequately \n19\nrepresented by existing parties.\nCourts have generally assumed that parent \n20\norganizations seeking to intervene in a desegregation \ncase meet the first two requirements. The Seventh Circuit \nhas said,\nIt may be conceded for purposes of this appeal that \n21\n\"[a]ll students and parents, whatever their race, have an \ninterest in a sound educational system and in the \noperation of that system in accordance with law.\" ... It \nmay also be conceded that this asserted interest might, as \na practical matter, be impaired by the disposition of this \nlitigation.\nUnited States v. Board of School Commissioners, 466 \n22\nF.2d 573, 575 (7th Cir.1972) (citations omitted), cert. \ndenied, 410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 \n(1973). See also Johnson v. San Francisco Unified School \nDistrict, 500 F.2d 349, 353 (9th Cir.1974); Hatton v. \nBoard of Education, 422 F.2d 457, 461 (6th Cir.1970).\nParent groups have usually foundered, however, with \nrespect to the third requirement--that the parents' \ninterest in educational and desegregation matters not be \nadequately represented by others. This third requirement \nis critical in a school desegregation context, because it \nserves to prevent \"a cluttering of lawsuits with \nmultitudinous useless intervenors.\" Kaplan,Continuing \nWork of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 356, \n403 (1967), quoted in C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure: Civil Sec. 1909. When a party is \ncharged by law with representing the interest of the \napplicant, then adequate representation is presumed. Id. \nat Sec. 1909. A school board is normally deemed to \nrepresent adequately the interests of parents and \nchildren in the district. Cisneros v. Corpus Christi \nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 6 of 10\nIndependent School District, 560 F.2d 190 (5th Cir.1977), \n23\ncert. denied, 434 U.S. 1075, 98 S.Ct. 1265, 55 L.Ed.2d 781 \n« up\n(1978); Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, \n427 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir.1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 943, \n91 S.Ct. 1607, 29 L.Ed.2d 111 (1971); Hatton v. Board of \nEducation, 422 F.2d 457 (6th Cir.1970). In this case the \ndefendant Boston School Committee is presumptively the \nadequate representative of the interests of the parents of \nBoston's school children.\nDespite the presumption, inadequacy of representation \n24\nmay be shown if there is collusion between the school \nboard and an opposing party, if the school board has an \ninterest adverse to the proposed intervenor, or if the \nschool board fails to fulfill its duty of representation. \nUnited States v. Board of School Commissioners, 466 \nF.2d at 575. See also Delaware Valley Citizens' Council v. \nPennsylvania, 674 F.2d 970, 973 (3d Cir.1982); Martin v. \nKelvar, 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th Cir.1969).\nBHSA moved to intervene in this suit at a time when \n25\nthe Boston School Committee was refusing to participate \nin the adoption of a desegregation plan and had been \nheld in contempt of court. At that time, the district court \nmight arguably have found that the School Committee \nwas failing to fulfill its duty to represent Boston parents \nin the litigation. Cf. Smuck v. Hobson, 408 F.2d 175, 181 \n(D.C.Cir.1969) (en banc) (lame duck school board failed \nin its duty of representation by not prosecuting an appeal \nfrom a desegregation order). The district court did not \nexpressly so find, however, and the conditions imposed \nwhen the court allowed intervention suggest, if anything, \nthat it regarded BHSA's status as permissive rather than \nas of right.\nNonetheless, even if BHSA's intervention in 1974 were \n26\nof right, a question we do not decide, it would have \ngained no absolute entitlement to continue as a party \nuntil termination of the suit. We agree with the Tenth \nCircuit that\nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 7 of 10\nproceedings of this nature which continue over such an \n27\nextended period of time are unique in respect to the \n« up\ntiming of the arrival and departure of parties .... [I]\nntervention and withdrawal should be freely granted so \nlong as it does not seriously interfere with the actual \nhearings.\nDowell v. Board of Education, 430 F.2d 865, 868 (10th \n28\nCir.1970). The district court needs the power to dismiss \nin order to manage complicated drawn-out proceedings \nefficiently. See Notes on Advisory Committee to \nFed.R.Civ.P. 24 (\"An intervention of right ... may be \nsubject to appropriate conditions or restrictions \nresponsive among other things to the requirements of \nefficient conduct of the proceedings.\"); Shapiro, Some \nThoughts on Intervention Before Courts, Agencies and \nArbitrators, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 721, 752-56 (1968).\nThe district court dismissed BHSA in 1982 because it \nfound that \"the duration and extent of BHSA's \nparticipation in this case have significantly exceeded the \ncourt's intentions at the time BHSA was granted status as \nan intervening party.\" For us to reverse the dismissal, \nBHSA must at least demonstrate that it currently \ncontinues to fulfill all three requirements for intervention \nof right. But with respect to the third requirement--\nadequacy of representation--there is no indication that \nthe Boston School Committee today suffers from the \ninfirmities which, in 1974, may arguably have rendered it \nincapable of adequately representing the parents. The \nSchool Committee long ago abandoned its intransigent \nstance over desegregation; subsequently elected School \nCommittees have fully participated in the case. See \nMorgan v. McKiegue, 26 F.2d 33 (1st Cir. 1984) (current \nchallenge by the School Committee to an order of the \ndistrict court relating to parents' councils). The district \ncourt found in the disengagement orders, \"With respect \nto the interests of parents and school personnel, \n[BHSA's] participation has become redundant.\" BHSA \nhas failed to indicate any grounds for our concluding that \nthe finding exceeded the court's discretion, or for our \nrejecting the presumption of the School Committee's \nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 8 of 10\nadequate representation at this time. BHSA, therefore, \n29\nenjoys no current right to insist upon continuing as an \n« up\nintervenor in the action.\nBHSA also argues that even absent a right to intervene, \n30\nthe dismissal must be reversed under the \"clear abuse of \ndiscretion\" standard applicable to Rule 24(b) permissive \nintervention. Allen Co. v. National Cash Register Co., 322 \nU.S. 137, 142, 64 S.Ct. 905, 907, 88 L.Ed. 1188 (1944); \nUnited States Postal Service v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, \n192 (2d Cir.1978). BHSA contends that the actual reason \nfor its dismissal was the district court's annoyance at \nBHSA's participation in the still-pending 1981 motion for \ntermination of jurisdiction, and at its forthright \ninsistence that the \"maximum practicable compliance\" \nhas been achieved.\nWhile a strong showing of improper motive might lead \n31\nus to reverse an otherwise proper dismissal, BHSA has \nnot, we think, made such a showing. The School \nCommittee was, after all, a party to the motion to \nterminate jurisdiction. It remains fully involved, and has \nan interest in independence from court supervision even \ngreater than BHSA's. Since the School Committee is the \nlegal representative of the parents, its tactical choices \nrather than BHSA's should control. United States v. \nBoard of School Commissioners, 466 F.2d at 575; \nBumgarner v. Ute Indian Tribe, 417 F.2d 1305, 1308 \n(10th Cir.1969).\nTo be sure, BHSA was the only intervenor dismissed, \n32\nbut three other intervenors were sharply limited in the \nscope of their intervention. Only El Comite was \npermitted to retain full party status, due, we suppose, to \nits representation of a particular minority group distinct \nfrom the plaintiffs. See, e.g., Johnson v. San Francisco \nUnified School District, 500 F.2d at 353-54 (district \ncharged with representing all parents did not adequately \nrepresent particular interests of students of Chinese \nancestry). Thus we are unable to conclude that the \ndismissal was improperly motivated.\nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 9 of 10\nBHSA quotes the following language from a recent \n33\nappeal in this case:\n« up\n[G]roups such as the BHSA are entitled to press for \n34\nspecific and detailed findings on issues such as whether \nor not good reason remains for the court's continued \njurisdiction over assignments.\nMorgan v. McDonough, 689 F.2d 265, 280 (1st \n35\nCir.1982) (footnote omitted). BHSA argues that this dicta \nconstituted a ruling mandating its continued \nparticipation. We do not agree. The above language \nmakes clear our insistence that after ten years or more of \ncourt intervention in the Boston schools the parties to \nthis litigation are entitled to secure, if they wish, a \ndefinitive ruling concerning the district court's \ncontinuing jurisdiction and role. We did not intend, \nhowever, to interfere with the district court's discretion \nwith respect to what groups are proper parties to the \ncase.\nWe are unconvinced by BHSA's contention that the \n36\ndistrict court's dismissal must be reversed because based \non a faulty premise about the School Committee's \nrecognition of the Citywide Parents Council (CPC). When \nthis argument was made on a motion to modify the \norder, the district court responded:\nMotion denied without hearing oral argument. School \n37\nCommittee's recognition of CPC was not the only basis \nfor Court's order dismissing H & S Assn. as a party. See \nfootnote 3 of 12/23/82 orders.\nThe district court considered the finding in footnote 3 \n38\non the redundancy of BHSA's participation to be an \nadequate ground for dismissal and we are constrained to \nagree under our above analysis.\nAffirmed.\n39\n* Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation\nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012\n\n726 F.2d 11 Page 10 of 10\nIn its brief, BHSA describes itself as a \"citywide parent \n1\norganization\" founded in 1908 \"comprised of thousands of \n« up\nparents of all ethnic and racial groups in scores of local \nHome and School Associations centered at various public \nschools throughout the City of Boston.\" Membership is \nopen to any school parent; these parent members elect \nrepresentatives to a central body that sets policy by \nmajority vote\nCC∅ | TRANSFORMED BY PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG\nhttp://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/726/726.F2d.11.83-1155... 7/10/2012",

Parts of \nthe Irving district are three times as close to Lewenberg \njunior high as to Irving. The feasibility of a Lewenberg to \nRogers or Irving switch is corroborated by the school \ncommittee’s  ad  hoc  decision  in  1972  which  allowed \nseveral white elementary school graduates who lived in \nthe Lewenberg district to attend the predominantly white \nIrving  or  Rogers  junior  highs  rather  than  the \npredominantly black Lewenberg. The Thompson middle \nschool district, 63% Black, was created in 1968 with the \nconversion  of  an  elementary  school  and  was \nsuperimposed upon the predominantly white Wilson and \nthe predominantly black Lewenberg. The effect of this \ndistricting was to provide students residing in the eastern \npart of the Thompson district with the option of attending \nWilson Junior high, 81% White, and those in the western \npart of the Thompson district with the option of attending \nLewenberg junior high, 95% Black.17 \nThe elementary schools in a portion of Boston stretching \nfrom just south of South Boston, Through Roxbury and \ninto Dorchester are districted with a similar effect: the \npredominantly  black  areas  are  cut  away  from  the \npredominantly  white  areas.

Noticeably,  the \npredominantly white schools to the east are located some \ndistance  away  from  the  dividing  line.  The  single \nexception to this pattern of separation is Champlain, 94% \nBlack, and that elementary school is practically on the \ndistrict line.

However, \nat future hearings concerning equitable remedies required to convert the Boston schools from a dual to a unitary \nsystem, the Keyes holding will of course be observed and consideration given to the treatment of non-whites other than \nblacks. \n \n2  The ordering of busing across governmental boundary lines— the transportation of students between the suburbs and \nthe city— remains of challengeable validity. The Supreme Court’s first encounter with the issue resulted in a \n \nfour-to-four affirmance of a Court of Appeal’s reversal of such a remedial order. See Bradley v.

The case was argued before \nthe Court on February 26, 1974, 42 U.S.L.W. 3500. \n \n3 \nThe Act was unsuccessfully attacked as unconstitutional by the Boston School Committee in 1966,  School \n  Committee of Boston v.

Because it is not \n \nnecessary to our decision, we shall not recount the details. \n \n5  The committee had in effect reversed its own plan to open the Lee school racially balanced. The circumstances \nsurrounding that situation are set forth more fully, infra. \n \n \n6  The facts surrounding this episode are set out more fully, infra. \n \n \n7  Recent political developments, however, may nullify the plan formulated under orders of the Supreme Judicial Court \nand steps taken by the city defendants to carry it out. On April 29, 1974 the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill \n \nrepealing the Racial Imbalance Act. On May 10, the Governor vetoed the bill but proposed amendments to the Act \nwhich would enervate it. \n \n8  Some of these federal programs have recently been reduced or eliminated, but the funds withheld may still be attained \nif Boston is found to be in compliance with a final desegregation order. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-5. \n \n \n9  While the HEW proceedings have paralleled this case, our findings are independent of the findings of the federal \nadministrative agencies. \n \n \n10  Where the word ‘defendants’ is unmodified in these findings, it refers only to the city defendants. \n \n \n11  When the state board protested, the defendants responded that the use of one wing for 302 students could not be \nconsidered an ‘opening’ of the school. \n \n \n12  The defendants’ original planning for Trotter, which is located in a heavily black section of the city, did not include \nrecruitment of white students. This feature was added at the insistence of the state defendants on June 28, 1966 when \n \nit became clear that otherwise Trotter would open racially imbalanced. \n \n13  Although the crisis ended in 1971, the defendants have still done nothing to redistrict Lee, which is now more than 80% \nBlack. \n \n \n14  In this instance ‘defendants’ refers to the city defendants other than the new superintendent of schools, Leary, who \nopposed the school committee’s action. \n \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

The committee appealed to the full bench but later withdrew its appeal. \n \n16  These advanced classes, 15 for grade five and 16 for grade six, were located in twenty elementary schools and \nconstituted ‘tracks’ to the three examination schools. Racial compositions were in evidence for 1970-71 and 1971-72. \n \nAn average total of 570 students were in these classes of whom white students comprised more than 80%. \n \n17  The effect of teacher placement on choices such as these will be discussed, infra. \n \n \n18  While the deputy superintendent was explaining the Joint Center proposals, one member asked incredulously, ‘You \nmean in addition to the children you have to shove the teachers all over the place also?’ \n \n \n19  At a committee meeting in March, 1970, the associate superintendent reported to the committee concerning the \nprospects of one such bill, ‘The only way we are going to get the Imbalance bill repealed—let’s face it—is for blacks to \n \nbe up there to fight for the repeal, which hasn’t happened up to this point yet . . .. I have told them that there will be no \nnew schools in Roxbury in the Model City area in Roxbury and North Dorchester unless the Imbalance bill is repealed.’ \nRoxbury and North Dorchester are heavily black residential areas of Boston. \n \n20  Until September 1972, when all schools in Boston became coeducational, Burke was for girls only.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  83 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Hennigan, 379 F.Supp. 410 (1974)   \n \n \n24  English had an overenrollment of 131 students in its main building during the school year 1968-69 despite the use of \ntwo distant annexes. \n \n \n25  The  administrative  judge  in  the  HEW  proceedings  characterized  this  option  for  Michelangelo  graduates  as  ‘a \ndiscriminatory escape mechanism.’ \n \n \n26  The options were uniformly so exercised. Records were available in a few instances, e.g., (a) when white students at \nMichelangelo junior high received seat preferences at Charlestown in addition to English, every one of them close \n \nCharlestown; (b) of 143 white students at Russell K-8 school given seat preferences at South Boston, English, Girls \nand Burke, 142 chose South Boston. \n \n27  By 1971-72 the number had tapered off to 171, probably due to the opening of new schools in black neighborhoods \nand transfers to suburban schools under the METCO program. \n \n \n28  Taking pride in the transfer policy became a refrain for members at subsequent school committee meetings, e.g., \nNovember 24, 1970, ‘Boston’s open enrollment policy as presently constituted is the democratic way. It’s the American \n \nway. It’s what we call freedom of choice.’ \n \n29  The same section also provides, ‘The term ‘racial imbalance’ refers to a ratio between non-white and other students in \npublic schools which is sharply out of balance with the racial composition of the society in which non-white children \n \nstudy, serve and work. \n \n30  Whether qualification for this group exception involves a showing of blood relationship, or extends also to all pupils \nresiding on streets where the original beneficiaries lived, was left uncertain at the trial, despite the court’s request of \n \ndefense counsel for clarification. \n \n31  The ‘neighborhood school’ policy has existed in Boston more in theory than in practice. At least 30,000 students \ncurrently  use  public  transportation;  students  walk  substantial  distances  to  school,  e.g.,  fourth  graders  up  to \n \nthree-quarters of a mile; high schools enroll students on a citywide basis; elementary districts may, on the one hand, \ninclude several neighborhoods or, on the other, split them up. \n \n32  A school committee’s policy and practice with regard to faculty and staff are ‘among the most important indicia of a \nsegregated system. Independent of student assignment, where it is possible to identify a ‘white school’ or a ‘Negro \n \nschool’ simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and staff . . . a prima facie case of violation of \nsubstantive constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause is shown.’  Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenburg \nBoard of Education, 1971, 402 U.S. 1, 18, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1277, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. \n \n33  This is the latest year for which the parties submitted information of this kind. Occasionally, in previous portions of the \nopinion, 1971-72 figures were used rather than 1972-73 because maps and charts had been prepared by the parties \n \nbefore the later figures became available. Also, whenever unqualified in this section of the opinion, ‘teachers’ includes \nboth permanent and provisional. \n \n34  This disparity is probably due to (1) the relatively younger mean age of Boston’s black population and (2) the larger \nproportion of white students enrolled in private schools, including roughly 30,000 in parochial schools, which associate \n \nsuperintendent for planning Leftwich estimated to have enrollments averaging between 75% And 80% White students. \n \n35  The maximum score on the BTE had been 400, and 280, or 70%, was the grade required to qualify for an interview. An \n800 score on the NTE was adopted by the board of examiners as the equivalent of a perfect score on the discontinued \n \nBTE and 560 was set as the cut-off thereby enabling the examiners to mix new and old lists of applicants, converting \nNTE scores to the old system by dividing them by two. \n \n36  Beginning in 1973, the cut-off score was reduced to 320 points, and the weight given to credentials and the personal \ninterview correspondingly increased. The cut-off had been reduced from 560 to 400 in 1972. Whether these changes \n \nwill eventually rectify past misuse of the NTE remains to be seen. \n \n37  Mr. Griffith’s opinion was given at a school committee meeting on August 23, 1972 in response to a question by the \nchairman about Boston’s success in black recruiting compared with other cities. Later in the meeting, the chairman \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  84 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Hennigan, 379 F.Supp. 410 (1974)   \n \n \n  observed, ‘Somewhere along the line we failed.’ \n \n38  Positions of assistant superintendent and above were filled not by rating but by the superintendent’s selection and \nschool committee approval. \n \n \n39  This report concluded, inter alia, that Boston’s promotion system prevented people from becoming higher level \nadministrators in Boston until they were more than fifty years of age. The concomitant effect upon the eligibility of \n \nblacks is obvious. \n \n40  No specific evidence was offered regarding programs at predominantly white district high schools comparable to the \ncourses given at Girls Trade. Thus our finding that Girls Trade is unconstitutionally segregated rests solely upon its \n \nracial composition, 25% White and 75% Non-white, in the light of other findings on the issue of defendants’ intent. \n \n41  Also, an agricultural vocational course is offered at Jamaica Plain for about 80 students who are placed in summer \njobs; however there was no evidence of these students’ races and accordingly we make no findings as to that \n \nvocational program. \n \n42  It does seem ironic that the cooperative-industrial program supplies the economic advantage which would be most \nhelpful to the black students: job access. \n \n \n43  Of 353 ‘extra-year’ cooperative-industrial students in district high schools in 1972, the only year as to which such \nfigures were introduced, 323 were white. \n \n \n44  We refer  to explicitly  racial policies,  not  presumably  neutral  policies  which  may  also  have  had  a  foreseeably \n  segregatory impact. See generally,  Hart v. Community School Board of Brooklyn, E.D.N.Y.1974, 383 F.Supp. 699 \nand 769. \n \n45  Racial censuses of housing projects were taken on the basis of white and non-white. How many blacks are included in \nthe non-white figures did not appear. However, since the other minorities in Boston comprise only a small percentage \n \nof the city’s population, the predominant part of the non-white population is most probably black. \n \n46  Apparently no housing project which has fallen below 80% White has stabilized at that point, but has shown a steady \nand rapid progression toward 100% Non-white. The black percent of the total population of Boston was 13.9% In 1970 \n \nand 16.3% In 1972. \n \n47  It has never been suggested by anyone that Brighton is separate or its schools unrelated; so no further findings will be \nmade about that section of Boston. \n \n \n48 \nWe do not read the Court’s opinion in  Keyes as Mr. Justice Powell seems to, 413 U.S. at 231, to hold that ‘the \n  motivation of school board action is . . . controlling in Colorado’, except when school authorities succeed in rebutting \nplaintiffs’ prima facie case. \n \n49  There was an absence of evidence only as to social, recreational and athletic policies. \n \n \n50  ‘I think the facts of the matter are that the Negro immigrants from the South are disinclined to put their effort into our \nnorthern type of education . . ..’ (June 28, 1971, at 63); ‘The Southern Negro pupil is not as spry usually in his \n \neagerness to learn as other children, and therefore the more lively children, the lively Negro children and the lively \nwhite children, start to move out, often the white children leading the outward procession.’ (June 1, 1971, at 105.) \n \n51  Remoteness in time has no relevance to the issue of intent. ‘If the actions of school authorities were to any degree \nmotivated by segregative intent and the segregation resulting from those actions continues to exist, the fact of \n \nremoteness in time certainly does not make those actions any less ‘intentional“.

Kerrigan, 401 F.Supp. 216 (1975)   \n \n \n5  It has been suggested that a person denied equal educational opportunity might have a valid claim for money damages \nagainst those who denied him this fundamental right. Sugarman, Accountability Through the Courts . . . , 82 \n \nU.Chi.Schl.Rev. 233 (1974); cf.  Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214, 1975;  Tillman \nv. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass’n, Inc., 4 Cir., 517 F.2d 1141. \n \n6  At least during the period covered by the trial testimony, Boston never had a true neighborhood school policy. See in \n  Morgan, supra, 379 F.Supp.at 473-474, the summary of school committee practices found to be ‘antithetical to a \nneighborhood school system.’ \n \n7  Another ground for refusing to limit a remedy for fear of ‘white flight’ is that a court would be presumptuous to try to \npredict the effect upon long-term trends in population movement of its adoption of a particular element, otherwise \n \nconstitutionally required, in a desegregation plan. The masters received expert testimony on the subject of ‘white flight’ \nfrom Boston’s public schools during the current school year and concluded that the contention was a ‘misleading \nfiction.’ Report of the Masters, at 65 n. 1. \n \n8  The word ‘race’ where used in this portion of the opinion refers also to ethnic groups such as Hispanics and \nAsian-Americans classified as ‘other minority.’ \n \n \n9  Student transfers from one district to another had been virtually eliminated by the court’s interlocutory order of June 21, \n1974 and a series of orders entered later in 1974. \n \n \n10  The cases are distinguishable, therefore, in which the incorporation of a geographically separate area was needed in \n  order  to  desegregate  the  system’s  predominantly  black  schools.  See,  e.g.,  Davis  v.  Board  of  School \nCommissioners of Mobile County, 1971, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577; United States v. Greenwood \nMunicipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 1086, cert. denied, 1969, 395 U.S. 907, 89 S.Ct. 1749, 23 \nL.Ed.2d 220; United States v. Indianola Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 626, cert. denied \n1970, 396 U.S. 1011, 90 S.Ct. 571, 24 L.Ed.2d 503. \n \n11  The plan’s student assignment guidelines set out a process for assignment, rather than a finished attendance plan. A \nfinished plan for community district schools, showing the geocode areas served by each community district school, is \n \nto be drawn by the school department pursuant to the guidelines and will be reviewed by the court. The review will \nconsider not only whether the school compositions lie within the guideline limits but also, more generally, whether the \nassignments show a reasonable accommodation, within the permissible ranges, of the several interests the plan is \ndesigned to serve. \n \n12  ‘Geocodes’ are the 800-odd areas, each several blocks in size, into which the school department has divided the city \nfor planning purposes (as noted in the plan, p. 252). The units were devised originally for police reporting purposes and \n \nvary in geographical area and also in student population, ranging from a few to several hundred students. \n \n13  The relative merits of assignments by address and by geocode are discussed at length in the State Defendants’ \nCritique of Masters’ Plan filed April 8, 1975, at pp. 48-51. \n \n \n14  The same necessity supports the plan’s provision, at p. 72, that geocodes may in some instances be divided into as \nmany as three parts. \n \n \n15  Variation is measured from district rather than system composition in community district assignments. Each district’s \nschools will enroll only students residing in the district. The range of racial compositions in the schools within a district \n \nwill be determined by reference to the percentages labeled ‘K-13 Total’ at the bottom line of the tables following the \neight district maps appearing in the plan. \n \n16  Under the court’s order, the Latin School Alumni Associations’ proposal can be implemented if to do so would result in \nentering classes at the seventh and ninth grades containing 35% combined black and Hispanic enrollment. \n \n \n17  The point has been made that it is desirable for all students in the system to choose their desired high school program \nat the same point, the end of middle school, in eighth grade. The Latin schools do, of course, take a limited number of \n \nstudents who enter at the ninth grade. There has, however, been no evidence that the existence of an earlier \nopportunity to enter the Latin schools disadvantages or denies equal educational opportunity disproportionately to \nblack students. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

While the initiation of Phase II may be accompanied by disruption detrimental to plaintiffs \nand defendants alike, a stay at this time would override the district court’s judgment to the further disadvantage of \nplaintiffs whose constitutional rights have already been violated. \n \n4  The Order of Appointment and Reference to Masters of February 7, 1975 specified that the masters were “to hold \nevidentiary hearings and make recommendations on a desegregation plan.” Their report was to  “contain their \n \nrecommendation for a desegregation plan for Boston public schools, together with the reasons for recommending that \nplan, including discussions of the key issues.” \n \n5  Although its filing out of time is opposed by the plaintiffs, we have considered on the question of stay the affidavit of Dr. \nJames S. Coleman. Once a proponent of the educational value of integration, Dr. Coleman now seems to advocate \n \nthat courts, instead of dismantling dual systems, limit themselves to the elusive task of identifying and remedying \nspecific segregative acts. As a practical matter, his thesis would seem to call only for the “neutral” remedies rejected as \ninadequate by the Supreme Court. See  Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 577 (1971);  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 22-31, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Moreover, the Supreme Court has ruled in other contexts that the prospect of “white flight” from \nthe public school system is an impermissible ground for avoidance of desegregation.  United States v. Scotland \nNeck City Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 490-91, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972);  Monroe v.

We note further that the implications for \nBoston of Dr. Coleman’s data and survey, which deal with other cities and situations, are far from clear. \n \n \n \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

The Massachusetts Board of \n \nEducation and the state Commissioner of Education, defendants in the school case, are among the appellees on this \nappeal and support the district court’s actions. \n \n2  The district court’s concern with facilities utilization is not unique to the Boston school case. The power to order new \nschools built and to close old ones has been recognized by the Supreme Court as one of the major tools available to a \n \ncourt and a school board to help remedy segregation. See  Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 240-41, 93 \nS.Ct. 2686, 2713, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring and dissenting);  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBoard of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 20-21, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1278, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). \n \n3  Among those listed for closing were the Conley and Richards schools. These were later taken off the list by the Joint \nPlanners and then reintroduced for closing by the district court on its own motion in order to assure, as per its August \n \n15, 1979 order, that “half of all excess (elementary school) seats” be eliminated. See text following note 8, infra. \n \n4  One concern of the School Department, according to defendant-appellants’ brief, was that identification of specific \n“support” schools would be “excessively destabilizing” and would threaten to “impair the School Department’s student \n \nrecruitment program.” In testimony, Mr. John Coakley, Senior Advisor to the Department of Implementation-the \ncourt-ordered  division  of  the  School  Department  overseeing  desegregation-stated that  a  prime  purpose  of  the \nproposals incorporated in the revised UFP was “the attraction of whites to some of our schools.” It thus seems clear \nthat one of the problems with the “Green Book”-at least as perceived by the School Department after airing the plan \nwith the public-was that it aggravated “white flight.” The record discloses that the number of whites in the Boston \nschools dropped from 53,503 in 1973-74 to 25,206 in 1978-79. The number of black and other minority students \nslightly increased during this period from 40,054 to 40,559. \n \n5  These proposals were largely the work of John Coakley of the Department of Implementation, Dr. Breeden of the \nOffice of Planning, and Ms. Mary Ellen Smith of the Department of Public and Community Affairs-all of the Boston \n \nPublic Schools. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 911 \n \n6  Under the desegregation plan developed by the district court in 1975, student assignments are made through use of \n“geocodes”-small subunits within each of the eight districts into which the city was divided. Administrators assign all \n \nstudents living within geocodes they select to a given school, endeavoring in the process to provide that school with \nthe degree of racial balance required by the court’s overall plan. See note 16, infra; Morgan v. Kerrigan, 401 F.Supp. at \n240. \n \n7  A further aspect of the Wood Plan was its endorsement of a so-called “moderate” student assignment approach to \ndesegregation. The Department of Implementation, as part of its overall planning process, had prepared with the aid of \n \na  computer  three  assignment  “simulations”  based  on  projected  student  populations.  The  first  emphasized \ndesegregation by using busing to achieve maximum compliance with the racial ratios established in the court’s 1975 \ndesegregation plan. See note 16, infra. The second emphasized “enrollment maintenance” by minimizing reassignment \nand school busing. The third-the “moderate” approach adopted by the Wood Plan-gave roughly equal weight to the \ngoal of achieving the court’s racial ratios and to that of minimizing the need for reassigning students to schools other \nthan those they were already attending. \n \n8  The court specifically noted the absence of a renovation and reconstruction schedule, the lack of a geocode simulation, \nand an inadequate space matrix. \n \n \n9  In Milliken the Court stated that desegregation remedies must be tailored to address unconstitutional conditions, must \nbe designed specifically to place victims of segregation in the positions they would have occupied had segregation not \n \noccurred, and must, where appropriate, “take into account the interests of state and local authorities in managing their \nown affairs, consistent with the Constitution.”  433 U.S. at 280-81, 97 S.Ct. at 2757. \n \n10  Whatever the merits of appellants’ contentions concerning various components of the UFP, we do not think the court \nwas lacking in authority, as appellants claim, to view the plan in parts rather than as a “package deal.” The plan as \n \npresented was not comprehensive, see note 8, supra. It was substantially altered on the eve of presentation; and it did \nnot require “take it or leave it” treatment. \n \n11  After the district court issued its April 2, 1980 opinion, the School and City defendants petitioned this court for a stay of \nits school closing orders. At a subsequent hearing on April 24 the district court announced  “tentative” student \n \nassignment orders for 1980-81. The court stated that it would follow the “moderate” approach, see note 7, supra, if this \ncourt  denied  the  stay  of  the  facilities  orders,  but  would  prefer  the  assignment  plan  emphasizing  busing  and \nreassignments if the orders were stayed. When the motions for the stay of the school closing orders were argued \nbefore this court on April 30, the plaintiffs-appellees reconsidered their position and decided that because “the records \nmay not support a finding of the requisite nexus between school closings and desegregation,” they would not oppose \nthe stay. On remand, the district court entered the stay of its school closing orders. It also entered a 1980-81 student \nassignment order on May 7 which was, in most respects, identical to the one entered for 1979-80. This order was not \nbased on either the “moderate” or “desegregation” models developed by the Department of Implementation during \n1980. \n \n12  Conley school remains open but, in light of the other closings in the Conley district, appellees contend it is highly \nunlikely that it will be necessary to close Conley in the foreseeable future. Appellants do not contest this. \n \n \n13  The district court’s student assignment order of April 24, 1979 was a conditional one which depended upon this court’s \ndisposition of the stay requested by defendants after its April 2 opinion. See note 11, supra. Because of this appeal, \n \nhowever, the court ultimately did not implement either the “moderate” or the “maximum desegregation” assignment \nplan for 1980-81. We review both the court’s April 2 opinion regarding assignments and its April 24 “conditional” order. \n \n14  The present case took nearly two years to reach us, due largely to inexcusable delays in transcript preparation. We will \nnot accept a repetition of such a delay. \n \n \n15  Appellants represented to this court at oral argument that the beacon school concept may be reintroduced into the UFP \nat a future date. \n \n \n16  Under the plan, a community district school was supposed to reflect, within a margin of error of 25 percent up or down, \nthe racial balance of the district. Thus, for example, if the district were 50 percent white and 50 percent minority, the \n \ndistrict school could be as much as 62.5 percent (50 percent times 25 percent with the product added to 50 percent) \nwhite or minority. Morgan v. Kerrigan, 401 F.Supp. at 241. \n \n17  Appellants admit that the court provided in its 1975 remedial order for “split” geocodes. See Morgan v. Kerrigan, 401 \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  14 \n \n\nMorgan v. McDonough, 689 F.2d 265 (1982)   \n6 Ed. Law Rep. 911 \n \n  F.Supp. at 261. We therefore find it difficult to see that the court would have lacked authority to make an order \nrequiring such action in 1980 when it was shown that as many as 24 schools would fall short of its racial balance goals. \nSimilarly, the court’s “conditional” assignment order of April 24 was directly linked to its effort to achieve the maximum \npracticable compliance with its longstanding racial goals. While we do not think the court should view its ratios as the \nsingle measure of desegregation progress, we note that the court ultimately did not press its position when its school \nclosing order lost the support of both parties. Rather it showed the flexibility required of a court enforcing an equitable \nremedy and resorted to the prior year’s student assignment plan. See note 11, supra. On the record before us, we \ncannot say the district court exceeded its remedial authority in its overall handling of this situation. \n \n18  These magnet schools were a part of the court’s 1975 desegregation plan and have apparently had much success \nboth in achieving desegregation and in gaining a reputation as “quality” institutions. Ironically, appellants now suggest \n \nthat the very success of these schools has made it more difficult to bring some geocode-centered community district \nschools into compliance with the court’s orders because magnet schools have tended to attract (and therefore drain) \nstudents from certain districts more than others. This leaves a given district school with fewer available students to \nachieve a racial ratio approximating the total racial percentages of the district. \n \n19  The court expressed concern that, as devised, the plan seemed to give a disproportionately large share of choices to \nwhite students. Under the plan, 1,635 “seats” would have become available. Some 1,076 of these would have gone to \n \nwhite students, 414 to black students, and 145 to other minorities. In addition, the plan as proposed had many seeming \nanomalies. For example, the O’Donnell School in District 8, which (according to the court) is “virtually 100 percent \nwhite,” was slated to have 50 beacon seats-42 for whites, 4 for black students, and 4 for other minorities. Such an \napportionment of options seemed questionable (although we recognize there could have been redeeming factors not \nnow evident to us). \n \n20  On a number of occasions in the record the appellants’ experts, including the Superintendent of Schools, admitted that \nthe beacon proposal could possibly lead to resegregation of the district schools though this, of course, was not \n \nintended and was considered unlikely. \n \n21  John Coakley of the Department of Implementation testified that combining classrooms within a linked pair of schools, \n“particularly in districts where the number of white children or number of black children is disproportionate, ... improves \n \nthe desegregative interaction even if the percentage doesn’t change significantly.” \n \n22  We note that the plaintiffs in this case are on record in an earlier filing to this court as saying that “we are concerned \nthat the records may not support a finding of the requisite nexus between school closings and desegregation ....” How \n \nfar this lack of “nexus” extends is not clear since this statement was made in connection with plaintiffs’ agreement not \nto oppose a stay of the specific school closing orders which were mooted before this appeal was heard. See note 12, \nsupra, and accompanying text. The need for elimination of “half-empty” schools to promote desegregation, however, is \nso far ingrained in the history of this case-both at its liability and remedial stages-as to be effectively “the law of the \ncase.” Absent an affirmative showing by appellants that this tool is without desegregative utility, we will not disturb \ndistrict court orders premised on this theory. \n \n23  The court specifically found that the linkage proposal was “well-intentioned.” \n \n \n24  Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1) requires that motions “shall state with particularity the grounds therefor ....” (Emphasis added.) \n \n \n25  The complete motion reads as follows: \nTHE BOSTON HOME AND SCHOOL ASSOCIATION’S MOTION FOR MODIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING COURT \n \nORDERS WITH RESPECT TO STUDENT ASSIGNMENTS \nThe Boston Home and School Association moves, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.

However, to date the district court has not \nacted  on  the  pending  motion.  The  city  defendants \nFootnotes \n \n1  In titling these orders “Final Orders” instead of “Final Judgment”, as first drafted, we follow the precedent and adopt the \n  reasoning of Judge McMillan in removing the cause from the active docket and closing the file in  Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, W.D.N.C.1975, 67 F.R.D. 648. \n \n2  A memorandum regarding these final orders will be filed at a later date. \n \n \n1  This memorandum is supplementary to the court’s July 5, 1985 memorandum and should be read in conjunction with it. \n \n \n2  In its efforts to develop a comprehensive consent decree during 1981 and 1982, the State Board organized all remedial \norders issued by the court between 1974 and 1981 into twelve categories. This breakdown was carried forward in the \n \ncourt’s memorandum and orders of disengagement issued on December 23, 1982, Appendix I, and the State Board \nundertook to monitor progress toward compliance by school defendants within each of these categories. The aim of the \ncourt and the parties at that time was to lay a foundation of fact on which to erect decisions as to final disengagement. \nTwo monitoring reports were filed in each year from 1983 to 1985, five in all, on the basis of which and by orders dated \nOctober 31, 1984, May 17, 1985, and August 8, 1985, entered after notice and hearing, jurisdiction ended with respect \nto these six categories. \n \n3  And maintain them decently. A minimum level of funding of annual maintenance and repairs is a bone of contention \nbetween  the  city  and  school  defendants,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  State  Board,  which  has  conditioned  its \n \ncommitments in the UFP to Boston’s raising this minimum from its present level of $6,000,000 to $8,000,000. See pp. \n17–19 of court’s memorandum on UFP orders dated September 3, 1985. \n \n4  The draft of this paragraph proposed by the court on July 5, 1985, set, as the standard of compliance, assignment of \nstudents “so that to the greatest degree practicable the racial/ethnic composition of each community district school \n \nreflects the public school student population....” The final order is partly a response to one of the objections advanced \nby the school defendants to the original draft, viz., that the “greatest degree practicable” standard, though taken \nverbatim from the decision of the Supreme Court in  Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenberg Board of Education, supra, \n402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), is insufficiently specific and objective to comply with Rule \n65(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 741 \n \n \n5  This component makes provision for a proportion of voluntary preferences for magnet schools that is substantially \ngreater than the proportion available in all but four of the nation’s thirty largest public school districts. \n \n \n6  As provided in an order dated May 24, 1985, each of the least populous groups, white and other minority students, \nwhich are combined for assignments to magnet schools, shall be assigned to each school in numbers roughly \n \nreflecting their respective percentages of citywide public school student population. \n \n7  The Hernandez has proven to be a successful and attractive bilingual school and the school committee voted to \ntransfer it to a larger facility and expand the program to include a middle school by September 1986. Its development \n \nand magnet program are described in R. Dentler and M. Scott, SCHOOLS ON TRIAL, An Inside Account of the Boston \nDesegregation Case, at 160–62 (1981). \n \n8  The order of August 25, 1982 was vacated by the Court of Appeals on February 2, 1984 and remanded for further \nproceedings not inconsistent with its opinion in Morgan v. McKeigue, 1 Cir.1984, 726 F.2d 33. \n \n \n9  This was an inadvertence by the court, conceded at hearings in open court almost immediately after issuance of the \norder. \n \n \n10  At the hearing on August 7, 1985 the court submitted to the parties a second draft of paragraph (4) which included the \nlast clause as finally ordered. \n \n \n11  The state legislature’s policy idea for creating SICs drew directly from research on Boston’s SPCs. \n \n \n12  The cited motion, appended proposals and court order appear at pp. 513–539 of volume II of State Board Report No. 4 \ndated February 1, 1985. \n \n \n13  Assumption (d) in the August 8, 1985 memorandum pertains to the average annual faculty turnover, i.e., number of \nretirements, resignations, extended leaves of absence etc. It should be clarified by the addition of three words, “that \n \nshould be”, which were omitted inadvertently, so that the phrase reads, “which is the figure that should be used in \ncalculating net changes.” \n \n14  As shown in Table 1 attached to the court’s August 8 memorandum, hundreds of teachers, mostly white, were laid off \nin 1981. On June 2, 1981, the court ordered that recall rights of tenured teachers be protected and suspended the \n \nrecruiting obligations of the school defendants. While white teachers were being recalled, there was scant recruitment \nof black applicants for faculty appointments. Last year, for example, only a single recruiting trip, to Howard University, \nwas made. Also, as shown in the same table, the percentage of black faculty increased by a total of only 1.8%, from \n19.1% to 20.9%, from 1981 until 1985. \n \n15  The figures 307 and 22 are found in Table 2, Model A, which shows increases in black faculty needed to achieve a \ncitywide population proportion of 23% by 1988–89, 2% less than the 25% target for that year urged jointly by the \n \nplaintiffs and school defendants. \n \n16  The figures 263 and 40 appear in Model B of Table 2, which shows increases in numbers of black teachers at the rate \nof .5% per year, from 20.86 to 21.36 to 21.86 etc., as required by the final order. \n \n \n17  The order for desegregation of administrative staff dated February 24, 1976, in para. 10, requires relatively even \ndistribution of black administrators throughout the system. \n \n \n18  The records of the Clerk of the United States Court for the Western District of North Carolina show that the Swann \ncase has been dormant for ten years. Only once, about five years ago, did a party, the school defendant, apply for the \n \nmodification of an order. Evidently some cases never die; they just fade away. \n \n19  Also the remaining orders do not apply to the city and state defendants, except for those pertaining to the UFP. \n \n \n20  Paragraphs (3) and (8) are mutually exclusive, i.e., should the school defendants decide to use the single citywide \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

This plan was commonly referred to as Phase I. See  379 F.Supp. at 483. \n \n4  The order provided that the ‘starting point’ for its desegregation decree would be that ‘the racial composition of the \nstudent body of every school should generally reflect the ratios of white and black students enrolled at that grade level \n \nof schools, elementary, intermediate, and secondary, throughout the system.’ \n \n5  This action by the School Committee led to contempt proceedings and a finding by the district court that three \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

This court denied a stay pending appeal of the \ncivil contempt order. Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 618 (1st Cir. 1975). Subsequently, the district court found that they \nhad purged themselves, and, ultimately, on January 27, 1975, the School Committee did submit a plan, different from \nthe staff proposal filed by counsel. \n \n6  An objection was made by the School Committee to the naming of two of the masters on the ground that their \nassociation with the Harvard University Graduate School of Education constituted a disqualifying interest in the \n \nHarvard Center for Law and Education, which presently or formerly employed three attorneys representing plaintiffs. \nThe School Committee also objected to the appointments of a third master and one expert because each had in the \npast supported the NAACP, which had provided financial assistance and counsel to the plaintiffs. The issue arising \nfrom the overruling of these objections will be dealt with later in this opinion. So also will be a further objection of the \nSchool Committee to the court’s order awarding compensation to the masters. \n \n7  According to this plan, various options were to be considered to deal with oversubscribed schools. These included the \nuse of temporary classrooms, and extension of the school year to increase capacity. The use of temporary classrooms \n \nto enable white schools to operate in excess of their capacity was found to be one of the bases of liability in this action. \nMorgan v.

Magnet programs could assist \n \ndesegregation if they satisfied certain conditions. They must be limited in number, and they must be carefully placed, \nso that the effect of the applications they attract is to promote desegregation. The Committee Plan, which proposes the \nintroduction of many magnet programs, satisfies none of these conditions, and could not possibly be put into operation \nby September, 1975.’ \n \n11  Comments of a member, and of the then Chairman, are revealing: \n‘The plan is ‘pie in the sky.’ It is a contradiction, it is impossible. All of us would love to see a voluntary desegregation \n \nsystem put into effect. It is not a practical reality. Of course I will vote for this.’ \n‘I would never vote for a plan that involved the busing of school children. It is unfortunate that is the way our society \nexists . . . but the only way you are going to desegregate city schools is through forced busing.’ \nThe only member of the School Committee to refuse to vote for the plan stated: \n‘I agree that it would be an ideal solution and therefore will not vote against it, but I will vote ‘present.’ I believe we \nshould have our votes consistent with what we feel is a reality.’ Remarks of Member Sullivan, Emergency Meeting of \nthe Boston School Comm., January 7, 1975. \n \n12  One provision, s 1714, facially proscribes any court ordered transportation of a student to a school other than one \n‘closest or next closest to his place of residence’ of the appropriate grade level and type of education. The Mayor \n \nproperly concedes that this section must be read in conjunction with s 1702(b) which states that provisions of the Act \n‘are not intended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts . . . to enforce fully . . . the Constitution. . . .’ \n \n13  The Association also argues that the adoption of the masters’ plan was required by F.R.Civ.P. 53(e)(2), on the theory \nthat the ‘delineation of the districts was a factual determination’ which could not be changed by the district court unless \n \nfound to be clearly erroneous. \nThis argument misconceives the type of reference made in this case. Rule 53(c) provides that ‘(t)he order of reference \nto the master may specify or limit his powers’, and that was done in this case. The Order of Appointment and \nReference  to  Masters  of  February  7,  1975,  specified  that  the  masters  were  ‘to  conduct  hearings  and  make \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

That rule’s mandate simply ‘does not . . . apply where the master is directed \nonly to report the evidence (and) to make recommendations . . ..’ 5A J. Moore, Federal Practice P53.12(2), at 3002; \nMatter of Van Swearingen Corp., 180 F.2d 119 (6th Cir. 1950). See  Hart v. Community School Board, 383 F.Supp. \n699 (E.D.N.Y.1974), aff’d,  512 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1975). This reference was not a substitute for trial, where the \nmaster to a large extent takes over the fact-finding process; the district judge could not delegate his duty to evaluate for \nhimself what actions had to be undertaken in order to remedy past failure to comply with the constitution. Indeed, we \ndoubt that the determination of district boundaries is accurately described as purely factual in nature, given the nature \nof this case. \nIt is uncontested, moreover, that the figures on which the masters relied in drawing their districts were outdated and \ninvalid in light of new figures submitted by the School Department shortly after the masters’ final report was filed. Both \nas to racial composition and numbers of students in the districts, the new figures rendered the factual assumptions \nunderlying the masters’ determination clearly erroneous. \n \n14  The  estimate  of  6,100  additional  students  who  would  be  bused  under  the  court’s  plan  (21,000-court  minus \n14,900-masters) ignores the impact of the new data, even had the masters’ districts remained essentially intact. For \n \nexample, the Burke district, eliminated by the court, had a capacity of 8,250 and an enrollment projected by the \nmasters of 7,590. But the new statistics revealed it as containing 11,620 students. Even after assuming that some of \nthe overflow would be absorbed by citywide magnet schools, there would remain perhaps 2,000 excess students. The \nMayor does not show that shifts in district lines to accommodate these students either by merging contiguous \nneighborhoods and their schools into Burke or by removing fringe neighborhoods from it would not encounter the \ndifficulty of increasing Burke’s percentage of black students, already a high 63%. Although the amount of additional \nbusing that would have been needed to take care of this situation is a matter of conjecture, it would appear to be \nsubstantial, if increased segregation were to be avoided. \nNot only student population but racial concentration estimates of the masters were at odds with the realities of the new \nfigures. The following discrepancies were found to exist: \n      Possible result \n \n    New figures  of allowed \n   \n    applied by  deviation of \n   \n  Master’s  court to  + 10 \n     \n  final  masters  percentage \n     \n  report  districts  points within \n     \n      each school \n \n       \nWest Roxbury  80% W  93% W  100% W \n       \nSouth Boston  60% W  67% W  77% W \n       \nBurke  50% B  63% B  73% B \n       \nThe result, particularly when the $ 10 point deviation is considered, represented substantial changes, unanticipated by \nthe masters. While the masters gave greater weight to neighborhood identity than did the court, it is far from clear that \nthey would have tolerated the higher concentrations shown by the new data. \nThe Mayor’s assumption that the court’s plan would involve anything close to the mandatory busing of 6,100 more \nstudents is therefore significantly vulnerable. \n \n15  As the court said in Brinkman v. Gilligan, 518 F.2d 853, 856 (6th Cir. 1975), ‘We construe the 1974 Act, read as a \nwhole, as not limiting either the nature or the scope of the remedy for constitutional violations in the instant case.’ \n \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  26 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401 (1976)   \n \n \n16  Additional comments in the same vein are to be found in various parts of the court’s opinion filed subsequent to the \nplan itself: \n \n‘The plan that the court has ordered into effect reflects the court’s continuing efforts to hold compulsory busing to a \nminimum.’ ‘The districts in this plan and the guidelines for assigning students have been drawn to minimize required \ntransportation as much as possible consistently with desegregating the city’s schools.’ ‘The plan adopted by the court \nattempts to minimize forced busing.’ \n \n17  The Mayor would have us answer this question in the negative by referring to other cases, affirmed by courts of \nappeals, where more schools were allowed to remain all black or more dominantly black than the masters’ plan \n \ncontemplated. Apart from the Mayor’s assumption that the masters’ plan contemplated no school more than about 53% \nblack—an estimate which, in the light of the new data, should be closer to 73%—we reject such a simplistic color \nmatching test to determine the constitutional sufficiency of any plan. \nThe cases cited by the Mayor reveal the hazard of picking as a control any one statistic of residual racial imbalance \nwhich another court may have approved. In three cases, Mims v. Duval County School Board, 329 F.Supp. 123 \n(M.D.Fla.), aff’d, 447 F.2d 1330 (5th Cir. 1971); Goss v. Board of Education, 482 F.2d 1044 (6th Cir. 1973) (en banc); \nand Northcross v. Board of Education, 489 F.2d 15 (6th Cir. 1973), geographic factors and, at least in Mims and \nNorthcross, the desire to avoid extensive long distance busing were relied upon to justify the lesser degree of \ndesegregation attempted. In two cases, Pate v. Dade County School Board, 434 F.2d 1151 (5th Cir. 1970) and Ross v. \nEckels, 434 F.2d 1140 (5th Cir. 1970), while more all black schools were permitted to remain, the courts of appeals \nhad insisted on reducing the number of pupils attending such schools to around 5% of the total school population. \nWere we to take this statistic as a control, we would have to declare the court’s plan, which leaves over 7% of the total \nstudent population attending the East Boston white schools, constitutionally inadequate. The remaining case,  Carr \nv. Montgomery Board of Education, 377 F.Supp. 1123 (M.D.Ala.1974), aff’d per curiam, 511 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir. 1975), \nconcededly insisted on a less stringent plan. Whether the desire to avoid cross-city busing would be, in our minds, \nsufficient to justify the lower objective, we have no reason to decide. The exercise of one district court’s discretion, in a \nparticular  case,  though  affirmed  on  appeal,  cannot  establish  constitutional  limits  for  other  courts  facing  other \ncircumstances. \n \n18  The district court also ruled that modification was not required by the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974. See \nnote 24 infra. \n \n \n19  A remedy may sometimes properly ‘exceed the violation’ in that it may do more than eradicate the constitutional wrong. \nTo the extent that ‘overbreadth’ in the remedy is necessary to ensure that the constitutional violation is corrected, it is \n \nnot at all unusual. There are many instances in the law in which remedial law places greater restrictions on primary \nactivity than did the substantive law that had been violated. For example, a company that is found to have violated the \nSherman Act will have its future operations governed by a much more restrictive standard than that imposed by the \nSherman Act itself. See  United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 88 S.Ct. 1496, 20 L.Ed.2d \n562 (1968). \n \n20  The Association recognizes that Swann, Davis, and Green provide that, during the remedial phase of a school \ndesegregation case, the district court must order the maximum practicable desegregation regardless of the degree to \n \nwhich the actual segregation in the schools is demonstrably the result of unlawful state action. The Association \nattempts to distinguish these cases on the ground that each involved school systems that had been segregated by \nstatute for years. In such school systems, the Association contends that the application of these remedial principles \nwas warranted because all segregation could be presumed to be the result of illegal official action. \nThe Association’s attempt to limit the applicability of these remedial principals to cases in which there had previously \nbeen a statutory dual school system fails. In Swann and Davis, the Court clearly did not proceed on the assumption \nthat the application of its remedial principles would operate only to eliminate the segregation which was directly \nattributable to illegal official action. The Court recognized that the segregation in those systems that remained after the \nschool authorities abolished the statutory dual system and adopted a ‘neighborhood’ school policy was, to some extent \na consequence of private residential patterns. See  Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 25—26, 91 S.Ct. 1267;  Davis, \nsupra, 402 U.S. at 36, 91 S.Ct. 1289. The Court clearly provided that although all the remaining segregation in certain \nschools may not be attributable to illegal state action, the schools must be subjected to the maximum practicable \ndesegregation.  Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 21 and 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267. \nThe lower federal courts have consistently rejected desegregation plans that attempted to justify the failure to \ndesegregate certain schools on the ground that the racial composition of those schools results from housing patterns. \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401 (1976)   \n \n \nMaximum feasible desegregation is required unless the school authorities can demonstrate that their actions in no way \ncontributed to the segregated character of the individual schools. See, e.g., Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, \n448 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1971); Goss v. Board of Education of Knoxville 443 F.2d 632 (6th Cir. 1971); Clark v.

Swann, however, cannot be read as supporting the proposition that causation is \nat issue during the remedial phase of a school segregation case when there has been a trial on liability. The burden \nthis language describes is essentially identical to that which the presence of substantial intentional segregation shifts to \nthe School Committee during the trial on liability. See  Keys, supra, 413 U.S. at 203—05, and 210—11, 93 S.Ct. \n2686. In Swann, the school authorities were afforded the opportunity to satisfy this burden at the remedy stage of the \nproceedings because here had been no trial on liability. Here, of course, the school authorities have had their chance. \n \n22  For example, although a dominantly white school in a white neighborhood may appear to be wholly the result of the \nethnic patterns of the neighborhood, when the School Committee has taken steps to incorporate the residential \n \nsegregation into the schools, to earmark that school as a white school, and to permit white students from other parts of \nthe city to attend it, that school has played a major role in skewing the racial profiles of the other schools in the system. \n \n23 \nThe Association places considerable reliance on  Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 \n  (1974), and, in particular, on its statement that ‘the remedy (in a school desegregation case) is necessarily designed, \nas are all remedies, to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the \nabsence of such conduct.’  Id. at 746, 94 S.Ct. at 3128. Although we understand why the Association believes this \nlanguage supports its position, we read this language as entirely consistent with the continued application of the \nremedial principles of Swann and other such cases. As we have demonstrated, restoring the victims of unconstitutional \nsegregation requires far more than eliminating the specific, demonstrable effects of the proven discriminatory acts. \nRestoration is necessarily a complex and widespread process. \n \n24  The Association also contends that the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 required the district court to adopt \nits remedial theory. In particular, the Association points to s 213 of the Act, which provides that ‘in formulating a remedy \n \nfor . . . a denial of equal protection of the laws, a court . . . shall seek or impose only such remedies as are essential to \ncorrect particular denials of . . . equal protection of the laws.’ 20 U.S.C. s 1712. This language, like the statement from \nMilliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974), discussed in note 23 supra, is \nentirely consistent with the continued application of the remedial principles of Swann, Davis, and Green. Because of \nthe pervasive effects of the School Committee’s actions, maximum practicable desegregation is ‘essential to correct \n(the) particular denials of equal protection (that occurred).’ See note 23 supra. \n \n25 \nAt oral argument, the Association argued that the Tenth Circuit’s recent decision on remand in  Keyes v. School \n  District No. 1, 521 F.2d 465 (10th Cir. 1975) (Keys II), supports its contention that, even after a trial on liability, the \ndistrict court is under an obligation to receive evidence on the discriminatory effects of the proven violations as part of \nits task in fashioning a remedy. Keyes II in no way supports this proposition. The evidence the district court admitted in \nKeyes II pertained to the question of liability, not to remedy.  Id. at 471—73. \n \n26  The Association suggests that it should be permitted to attempt to rebut the Keyes presumptions now because the \ndefendant School Committee was not afforded an opportunity to do so at the liability stage of proceedings since Keyes \n \nhad not been decided at that time. We find this suggestion utterly without merit. The effect of Keyes was before the \ndistrict court during the trial on liability, it having been decided on June 21, 1973, a time when that trial had been \nreopened. The School Committee did not seek a reopening on the issues presented by Keyes; it described Keyes as a \nrestatement of the principles of the earlier Supreme Court decisions. In any event, the district court found that the \nrecord was sufficiently complete to apply Keyes,  379 F.Supp. at 479, and that finding was not challenged on \nappeal. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  28 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401 (1976)   \n \n \n27  In the alternative, it is claimed that the district court should have taken white flight into account in modifying the \nmasters’ plan. See Part A 2, supra. The masters, however, rejected considerations of white flight in drafting their plan. \n \n \n28  ‘But it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply \n  because of disagreement with them.’  349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. at 756. \n \n29  Subsequent to the district court decision, we allowed to be filed, subject to a determination of relevance, voluminous \naffidavits and other materials by social scientists on the subject of white flight. \n \nThe admissibility of these submissions have been attacked as being outside the record, F.R.A.P. 10(a), and as \nhearsay. The materials have been defended as sociological data in the nature of ‘legislative facts’ relevant to a \ndetermination of the law governing the district court in this matter. \nFor reasons we discuss in the text, we reject all these materials as irrelevant to the issues before us on this appeal. We \ninclude a brief synopsis of these materials to illustrate the difficulty in evaluating white flight if it were relevant. \nThe data submitted initially by the Association consists of an affidavit and report prepared by James S. Coleman, \nProfessor of Sociology at the University of Chicago. Dr. Coleman states that his recent study shows that while there is \ndecreasing segregation within school districts, segregation between school districts in the same metropolitan area is \nincreasing; that rapid increase in loss of white children from central city schools follows immediately after school \ndesegregation;  and  that  as a  consequence, desegregation  has  not significantly  raised  the levels  of  academic \nachievement of blacks. \nPlaintiffs counter with the transcript of testimony given by Jane R. Mercer, Associate Professor of Sociology, University \nof California at Riverside, in a case involving Indianapolis. Her testimony shows that she studied desegregation in \nschool districts throughout the state of California; that white exit to private schools is a short term phenomenon; and \nthat declines in white population in the cities are part of a long term demographic trend independent of desegregation. \nThe plaintiffs also submit a paper written by Meyer Weinberg, Editor of Integrated Education magazine, which \nsummarizes other studies showing white flight to be an avoidable phenomenon, not an inevitable consequence of \nmandatory desegregation. Weinberg’s paper and another paper written by Professors Green of Michigan State \nUniversity and Pettigrew of Harvard University, criticize Dr. Coleman’s methodology, claiming that the source of his raw \ndata is unknown; that failure to evaluate large cities which have been subject to massive desegregation orders \nseparately from large cities which have not been subject to court orders undermines the study’s relevancy; and that \nfailure to control for other variables, which may be correlated with white flight, jeopardizes the  validity of his \nconclusions. \nDr. Coleman replies in an affidavit filed with a copy of a working paper, ‘Trends in School Segregation, 1968—73’. In \nhis affidavit, Dr. Coleman states that the report previously filed with the court was prepared for oral delivery and was \nbased on the attached working paper. He defends his methodology, states that his conclusions are consistent with the \nfindings of the studies cited by Weinberg, and the studies conducted by Dr. Mercer. Dr. Coleman states that his study \nshows that massive white flight will occur when there is a significant decrease in segregation in a city where there is a \nhigh proportion of blacks in the central city and suburbs of a significantly different racial composition. \nPlaintiffs, in rebuttal, file another study prepared by Christine H. Rossell, of Boston University. The Rossell study, \nprepared  from  data  on  86  northern  school  districts  subject  to  court  ordered  or  legislatively  enacted  school \ndesegregation, suggests that white flight is minimal and a temporary reaction to school desegregation. Plaintiffs claim \nthat Dr. Rossell’s study differs from Dr. Coleman’s in that Dr. Rossell deals only with northern school districts subject to \ndesegregation plans while Dr. Coleman does not distinguish between forms of desegregation. \nIn the final submission, Dr. Coleman defends his study against the Rossell findings, suggesting that her analysis is \ninadequate to examine the effects of desegregation on a core city school system. He further claims that his model has \nproved accurately predictive of the Boston experience. \nThroughout this series of submissions this court has been burdened with reports written for sociologists by sociologists \nutilizing sophisticated statistical and mathematical techniques. We lack the expertise to evaluate these studies on their \nmerits.  We  do  come  to  one  conclusion,  however.  The  relationship  between  white  flight  and  court  ordered \ndesegregation is a matter of heated debate among experts in sociology, and a firm professional consensus has not yet \nemerged. \nAppellants have also filed with this court copies of the Boston School Department’s current census of students \naccording to race and minority group. The figures facially suggest loss of a significant number of white enrollees. We \nnote, however, that the district court is currently studying the accuracy of past enrollment data. We decline to make any \nconclusions concerning the existence or nonexistence of white flight on the sparse figures available to us. \n \n30  Appellants suggested approach would necessarily involve the district court in something like the following analysis: (1) \ntake evidence concerning the prospects of white flight under the various plans proposed; (2) exclude the causes of \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  29 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401 (1976)   \n \n \n  such flight attributable to any historic trend, or such factors as overcrowding, transportation difficulties, deteriorated \nhousing, taxes, crime, pollution, industrial migration, etc.; (3) make a judgment as to the effect which different levels of \ndesegregation  would  have  no  white  flight;  and  (4)  select  or  devise  that  plan  which  will  incorporate  enough \ndesegregation to bring about the maximum amount of inter-racial contact in the schools after taking account of the \nwhite flight such desegregation would be expected to induce. \nThe experts have difficulty in attempting to justify conclusions as to the effect of past desegregation plans on white \nflight, see note 29 supra; the task of making estimates of expected exodus of whites attributable to varying future \ndesegregation plans would seem to be more difficult. Conceivably, public attitude sampling could be undertaken, using \nvarious hypotheses. This might involve questioning parents in a particular section or school district whether they would \nbe likely to place their child elsewhere, or move, if the child were to attend a school which was x, y, or z percent black. \nThe possibility is a real one that surveys would indicate that the prospect of any substantial amount of desegregation or \nbusing would provoke sufficient expressions of intent to flee as to negate any desegregation plan. Alternatively, if \nexpressed intentions were to be heavily discounted, their utility would accordingly diminish. \n \n31  Rough equality between districts was desirable to allow students from all the districts equal access to the citywide \nmagnet schools without adversely affecting desegretation of the districts. \n \nThe district court divided the school system into eight community districts and a ninth citywide district. The overall racial \ncomposition of the system for the 1975—76 school year was projected at 51% white (W), 49% black and other minority \n(B&OM). The projected enrollments in the seven community districts which would be desegregated ranged in racial \ncompositon  from  61%  W—39%  B&OM  to  40%  W—60%  B&OM.  The  eighth  district,  East  Boston,  was  left \npredominantly white decause of its isolated geographic location. \n \n32  In district 4, with a projected racial composition of 61% W—39% B& OM, the permitted variance of the composition of \nthe schools is 70% W—30% B&OM; 50% W—50% B&OM. Because the percentage of black and other minority \n \nstudents cannot fall below 30% (39%—25% (39) $ 30%), the percentage of white students cannot rise above 70%. The \nsame observation, in reverse, pertains to district 7, which is 40% W—60% B&OM. \n \n33  Since citywide project composition was 51% W—49% B&OM, magnet schools could permissibly enroll 56—46% W, \n44—54% B&OM. The bilingual, bi-cultural magnet, Hernandez, was excepted from this requirement. \n \n \n34  The entering classes normally enroll 6—8% Asian-Americans. When these numbers are added to the black and \nHispanic students, the percentage of the entering class which is characterized as black and other minority is in the \n \nrange of 41—43%. As school officials testified that it would be difficult to find sufficient black and Hispanic students to \nsatisfy the minimum figures, the district court apparently did not consider it necessary to place an upper limit on \nminority enrollment. \n \n35  This fact also disposes of the Association claim that imposing a racial preference at the examination schools is \n  unconstitutional for those reasons expressed in Justice Douglas’ dissent in  DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, \n320, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974). Whatever the constitutionality of racial preferences in the absence of past \nunlawful discrimination, they are a basic tool in remedying constitutional violations. See  Castro v. Beecher, 459 \nF.2d 725, 737 (1st Cir. 1972). \n \n36  The old method of selecting admittees to the schools was mandated by a consent decree between the School \nCommittee and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). This decree introduced the SSAT and \n \nadmission was based solely on the scores of that test. As the plaintiffs were not parties to the MCAD litigation, the \ndistrict court was not bound by the consent decree. \nAn alternative plan, proposed by the alumni associations of the affected schools, would have had 65% of admission \nbased on the SSAT scores alone, the remaining 35% to be chosen in racial proportions but setting a score in the 50th \npercentile on the SSAT as a floor for admissions. \nThe masters’ plan allowed for grade point averages as well as SSAT scores to be used, but adopted the use of a \nSSAT score floor. \n \n37  Appellants claim that only 25% of admittees come from advanced work classes. While it is obvious that the \nexamination schools cannot be completely desegregated by the advanced work classes, desegregation of the classes \n \nis a positive step. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  30 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401 (1976)   \n \n \n38  The district court rested its decision on the qualifications of Master McCormack and Expert Dentler on the alternative \nground that the School Committee’s objections were not timely filed. The objection to the qualifications of these \n \nindividuals took the form of a motion to expunge filed on March 4, 1975, more than a week after the masters’ hearings \nconcluded and almost a month after the February 6 deadline for filing objections. Since we hold that the district court \ndid not err in its ruling on the merits, we need not reach this point. \n \n39  We need not express an opinion on the timeliness of this objection in the light of our holding on the merits. \n \n \n40  On appeal, the School Committee suggests that it was improper for the district court, in considering the School \nCommittee’s objections, to rely upon interviews with Masters Keppel and Willie and upon representations of plaintiffs’ \n \ncounsel. It is clear from the record, however, that the School Committee acquiesced in this method of investigation. \n \n41  The Harvard Graduate School of Education has, on several occasions, been hired by the School Committee to conduct \nsurveys. Expert Dentler, in his capacity of Dean of Boston University’s School of Education, has done work for the \n \nCommittee. Thus, three of the four individuals challenged have benefitted financially from their relationships with the \nSchool Committee. \n \n42  The experts and masters felt this number would so saturate the city as to deny the magnet schools a desegregative \neffect, their raison d’etre. See note 10, supra. \n \n \n43  The court’s plan left intact the programs of those citywide schools which had established themselves over the years as \nmagnets, and it apparently adopted a number of the magnet programs as proposed in the Committee plan. The \n \nCommittee’s appeal is addressed only to five or six instances where it is felt that the court’s plan is inconsistent with its \nown proposals. \n \n44  The city defendants, charged with paying the costs, have not objected to these councils. \n \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document  © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

The court will not review such plans if \n \nthe school defendants, through the DI, and the State Board, are in agreement. This provision refers only to planning \nand implementation under existing orders. Plans for modifying outstanding orders must be pursued according to the \nprocess prescribed in § VII of these orders. \n \n5  The DI’s primary responsibility for planning and implementing space matrices includes those for special needs \nstudents. \n \n \n6  See Appendix I for catalogue of applicable orders in each area. \n \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 613 \n \nTOTALS:  430.41    110,653.00  3,162.69  113,815.69   \n         \n7   Defendants’ initial objection to this item was waived at page 10 of their memorandum filed December 13, 1993. \n \n \n8  These were merely token concessions, however, since they pertained to only 4.5 hours of 96 hours claimed by Atkins \nduring a period of more than two years; and to only 24 hours of the 115 hours claimed by Pressman during the same \n \nperiod. \n \n9  Both were closely associated with the Court’s plan, Alves as Project Director for Boston Desegregation Assistance at \nthe State Board, and Willie as one of the four Masters who designed the plan adopted by the Court in 1975. \n \n \n10  Agreement on this point is qualified by defendants’ contention, addressed  post, that charges by Pressman for \nconferring with Atkins should be disallowed because they are “duplicative legal services.” \n \n \n11  The Court’s memorandum dated August 2, 1983 acknowledged the first State Board monitoring report as “a long step \ntoward a common ground from which the parties can discuss and confront issues of compliance and non-compliance in \n \nan intelligent and informed fashion.” (emphasis added) \n \n12  Former Superintendent Wilson’s affidavit dated May 25, 1989 stated, at paragraph 15: “During February and March \nand April, my staff brought to my attention numerous additional concerns and recommendations for changes in the \n \nPlan raised during the course of the paragraph 8 proceedings. I considered them carefully and recommended to the \nCommittee that it approve a number of amendments to the Plan based on those recommendations.” \n \n13  In the instant case, no such basis existed for an award of plaintiffs’ fees against intervenor BTU and plaintiffs have not \nsought one. BTU’s appeal reasonably raised substantial legal questions. \n \n \n14  To the best of our knowledge the number of appeals from various orders entered in the Morgan litigation is 17. \n \n \n15 \nAs stated in  Jenkins, 967 F.2d at 1251: “[G]iven the special nature of desegregation cases, withholding from the \n  plaintiffs the means for paying their attorneys could be devastating to the national policy of enforcing civil rights laws \nthrough the use of private attorneys general.” \n \n16  Defendants’ initial memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs’ applications, filed April 2, 1990, states in footnote (1): \nOver the lifetime of this case both the City and school defendants have paid over $1.5 million in attorneys’ fees. \n \nPlaintiffs’ instant application requesting another $95,000 for fees and costs allegedly expended over a one-year \nperiod is particularly disturbing since this case was “closed” and removed from this Court’s active docket five years \nago. \n \n17  Counsel have not sought compensation for miscellaneous services rendered thereafter, including a supplemental \nmemorandum, filed on June 1, 1995 responding to defendants’ reliance upon the Zipes case in connection with the \n \nintervenor BTU appeal. \n \n18  Thereafter defendants followed the same procedure in opposing plaintiffs’ several subsequent periodic applications, \nlisted ante in the Overview of Applications section. \n \n \n19  In considering fee applications, the court need not “set forth hour-by-hour analyses of fee requests,” Jacobs, 825 F.2d \nat 562, nor “drown in a rising tide of fee-generated minutiae,” United States v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm’n, 847 F.2d 12, \n \n16 (1st Cir.1988). \n \n20  Defendants’ memorandum filed December 13, 1993 states: \nMoreover, activities related to fee requests are not compensated at the same rate as other activities. See, e.g., \n \nGrendel’s Den v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945 (1st Cir.1984). The defendants have therefore considered fee related \nactivities as non-core activities and suggest compensation for fee activities accordingly. \n \n21  The law in the other Circuits is to the same effect. The Ninth Circuit found the failure of a District Judge to adjust rates \n  of compensation to account for the lost time value of money to be an abuse of discretion.

Law Rep. 135 \n \n6  The specific projects that had been ordered on May 3, 1976 and were vacated on May 6, 1977 were the setting of a \ndeadline for the reopening of Roslindale High School, the phaseout of Dearborn Middle School, the construction of a \n \ngymnasium and a cafeteria for Champlain and Holmes middle schools, repairs and renovations at Hyde Park and \nDorchester high schools and Barnes Middle School, a schedule for renovating Roslindale High, and the long-range \nconstruction of school facilities. \n \n7  These plans were in large part reruns of school department proposals that had been rejected by the panel of four \ncourt-appointed masters five years earlier, when the masters were drafting the “phase two” student desegregation plan \n \nadopted and promulgated by the court in May, 1975. \n \n8  These capacity and enrollment figures, while acknowledged by the court, are neither approved nor rejected, being \nproperly subject to ongoing refinement by the joint planners. \n \n \n9  By order issued on May 9, 1985, at the request of the school defendants, the court approved the renovation projects \nscheduled for the current fiscal year because any substantial delay in initiating them would result in at least some of \n \nthe projects being unfinished by the opening of school in the fall of 1985. These projects include the modernization of \nthe heating systems at Hyde Park (IC–13), Burke (IC–7) and Boston Technical (IC–5) high schools, Dearborn (IC–24), \nGavin (IC–27), Wheatley (IC–41) and Lewenberg (IC–31) middle schools and Haley (IC–124) elementary school; and \nnew roofs at Madison Park High (IC–15) and Hennigan (IC–125) elementary. The estimated total cost of these projects \nis $4,290,000. To help understand the pagination of the UFP, its Table of Contents and number of pages in each \nsection is appended hereto as Appendix “A”. \n \n10  In all, twenty schools were so designated at one time or other. See State Board Report No. 4, July 15, 1984, Vol. II, pp. \n73–74 for a complete listing. \n \n \n11  Pursuant to the court’s initial orders of disengagement entered on December 23, 1982, the State Board filed five \nsemi-annual monitoring reports, each in two or three volumes totaling 600–800 pages and containing separate \n \nmonitoring reports on each of twelve subdivisions of court orders entered in the case. The first report was dated July \n15, 1983 and the fifth, July 15, 1985. Two of the subdivisions were entitled “Special Desegregation Measures” and \n“Facilities” and furnish an indispensable background to an understanding of the instant memorandum and orders. \n \n12  The court’s finding with respect to needs of District 5 as well as those of Burke High (IC–7) is predicated in part on a \nmemorandum prepared by court expert Dr. Robert A. Dentler dated January 16, 1985, which was distributed to the \n \nparties on January 18, 1985. It describes a jeopardy shared by students in Districts 4 and 5. Relevant excerpts are set \nforth in Appendix B. Incidentally, two of the nine designated special measures schools, Thompson Middle and P. Shaw \nElementary, are located in Community District 4. \n \n13  Additional repairs done at South Boston High during July and August have not eliminated the threat of loss of \naccreditation, although they did accomplish two of the alterations required by NEASC, viz., adding a lavatory to the \n \nnurse’s room and some partitions in the guidance counseling offices. The school department also replaced floors in six \nclassrooms and staff members volunteered the work to replace the floors in two other rooms. Interior painting of the \nbuilding was also completed professionally. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document  © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

Stotts, 1984, 467 U.S. 561, 104 \n  S.Ct. 2576, 81 L.Ed.2d 483, is relevant to this matter. That case involved the balancing affirmative action in layoffs with \nseniority where no judicial determination of liability had been made and no proof of discrimination against those \nindividuals who would benefit from the affirmative action had been found. Here a finding of constitutional violations has \nbeen made. The Supreme Court’s analysis of individual proof of discrimination is inapplicable in the present situation, \nwhere the remedy is sought on behalf of third parties: the public schoolchildren of Boston. \n \n2  The court’s remedial orders concerning faculty and staff desegregation are based on the remedial requirements of the \nplaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenors, not on any independent rights of black and other minority educators themselves. \n \n \n3  When a similar order regarding black administrators was issued at the hearing of July 9, 1981, an order regarding other \nminority administrators was deemed unnecessary because of the school defendants’ plans to retain the only two other \n \nminority principals employed at that time. \n \n1  The court does not anticipate that such petitions will be necessary for the same reasons that it finds that the time is ripe \nfor ending its involvement in the case. However, the plaintiffs are entitled to court enforcement in the event that the \n \nschool defendants violate permanent orders. \n \n2 \nThe January 28, 1975 order is published at  Morgan v. Kerrigan, 388 F.Supp. 581, and affirmed by the First Circuit, \n  1 Cir.1976, 530 F.2d 431, cert. denied, Doherty v. Morgan, 1976, 426 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 2649, 49 L.Ed.2d 386. The \nFebruary 24, 1976 order was never published, nor appealed. \n \n3 \nThe recruitment and hiring of other minority faculty and staff is governed by a so-called Lau Agreement (after  Lau v. \n  Nichols, 1974, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1) between the school defendants and El Comite approved by \nthe court on November 26, 1984. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document  © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

The Act was amended, after the district court opinion was filed, to limit sharply the measures \nwhich the state board may employ in attempting to bring about racial balance in the schools. St.1974, c. 636 (July 26, \n1974). The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently considered these amendments, and found that they would \nbe unconstitutional if interpreted to reverse or impede the progress toward the achievement of racial balance in a city \nalready subject to a state court order that a racial balance plan be implemented. School Comm. v. Board of Educ., \nMass., 319 N.E.2d 427 (1974) (Springfield). Since the district court’s opinion is founded upon the federal constitution, \nthe merits of this appeal would in no event be affected by the amendments. \n \n3 \nThe district court’s opinion,  379 F.Supp. 410, 418—421 (D.Mass.1974), contains a succinct summary of this history \n  of litigation, involving seven decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, three decisions of a Single \nJustice thereof, a number of Superior Court proceedings, a decision of a federal Administrative Law Judge resulting in \nthe withholding of many millions of dollars in federal educational assistance funds and, at  379 F.Supp. at 450—451, \na discussion of the decision of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, finding discrimination in the \nBoston School Committee’s open enrollment and controlled transfer practices. \n \n4  The state defendants, whose position on most issues was identical with that of plaintiffs, were found not to have \nintentionally contributed to racial segregation in the Boston public schools. On the contrary, the court held that they had \n \ndone all that was possible under their limited authority to compel the city defendants to obey the state law and the \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  15 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580 (1974)   \n \n \nfederal constitution. The court, however, retained the state defendants in the case to help in the formulation and \nimplementation of remedies. The state defendants have not appealed. Where unqualified reference is made to \n‘defendants’ in this opinion, only the city defendants are embraced by the term. \n \n5  Non-black minority students comprise approximately 7% of the city’s public school population, but no issues with \nregard to possible discrimination against these students were presented to or considered by the district court. See \n \n379 F.Supp. at 415 n. 1. \n \n6  Of eighteen high schools, only two came close to that ratio. All of the five citywide special examination and trade \nschools were either overwhelmingly black or overwhelmingly white. The four middle schools were from 63% to 94% \n \nblack. Only two of the fifteen junior high schools approached the overall student ratio, the others being predominantly \nwhite or black. Only five of some 140 elementary schools came within 10% of the overall 61:32 ratio. \n \n7  Before the district court the city defendants also raised the similar defense, alluded to in this quotation from their brief, \nthat they were entitled to adhere to a neighborhood school policy, which would be constitutionally valid despite any \n \nsegregative consequences. The district court pointed out that several practices of the defendants were antithetical to \nsuch an asserted policy: extensive busing, open enrollment (and, we add, controlled transfer), multi-school districts, \nmagnet schools, citywide schools, and feeder patterns,  379 F.Supp. at 473. Moreover, the court noted, the \nelementary district map is inconsistent with the neighborhood concept, schools being located near the edges of \ndistricts rather than near the center. Defendants have not stressed this defense on appeal. \n \n8 \nThese passages from Keyes obviously find their antecedent in  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Educ., \n  402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). At 202 of 413 U.S. at 2694 of 93 S.Ct., Keyes quotes from \nSwann, 402 U.S. at 20—21, 91 S.Ct. 1267, which refers to choices of the school authorities as to school location \nand various techniques of student assignment, and states that they have been ‘used as a potent weapon for creating \nor maintaining a state-segregated school system.’; that sometimes new schools were built in white areas ‘farthest from \nNegro population centers in order to maintain the separation of the races’ ( Keyes, 413 U.S. at 203, 93 S.Ct. at 2695 \nquoting  402 U.S. at 20—21, 91 S.Ct. 1267); and that merely neutral assignment plans ‘may fail to counteract the \ncontinuing effects of . . . location of school sites or distortion of school size in order to achieve or maintain an artificial \nracial separation.’ ( Keyes, 413 U.S. at 212, 93 S.Ct. at 2699, quoting  402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267). \n \n9  The unreality of the action-inaction dichotomy has been underscored by Mr. Justice Powell’s opinion, concurring in part \n  and dissenting in part, in  Keyes, supra, 413 U.S. at 234—235, 93 S.Ct. at 2710: \n‘The most routine decisions with respect to the operation of schools, made almost daily, can affect in varying degrees \nthe extent to which schools are initially segregated, remain in that condition, are desegregated, or—for the long term \nfuture—are likely to be one or the other. These decisions include action or nonaction with respect to school building \nconstruction and location; the timing of building new schools and their size; the closing and consolidation of schools; \nthe drawing or gerrymandering of student attendance zones; the extent to which a neighborhood policy is enforced; the \nrecruitment, promotion and assignment of faculty and supervisory personnel; policies with respect to transfers from one \nschool to another; whether, and to what extent, special schools will be provided, where they will be located, and who \nwill qualify to attend them; the determination of curriculum, including whether there will be ‘tracks’ that lead primarily to \ncollege or to vocational training, and the routing of students into these tracks; and even decisions as to social, \nrecreational, and athletic policies.’ \n \n10  Charlestown, Hyde Park, Roslindale, and South Boston High Schools as well as Cleveland, Graven and Rogers Junior \nHigh Schools, each with between 84 and 99% white students, are overcrowded. In addition, Dorchester High, the \n \nexception to the rule, with 52% black students and 46.8% white students is also overcrowded. \nBoys Trade, English High, Girls High, Jeremiah Burke High, King Middle School and Timilty Junior High School, each \nwith 66 to 95 percent black students, have a substantial number of vacant seats. The pattern was also observable at \ngrade school levels.  379 F.Supp. at 426. The district court points out that some cases were extreme and dramatic. \nSouth Boston High, all-white, was overenrolled by 676 students in the 1971—1972 school year; at the same time 92% \nblack, Girls High was underutilized by 532 places. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  16 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580 (1974)   \n \n \n11  A fourth is busing. While the school board has balked at mandatory busing for whites, a great deal of voluntary busing \nhas been undertaken in Boston. In addition to the regular busing of one third of Boston’s students, primarily to high \n \nschools, there were voluntary programs aimed at improving integration. The Metco and Exodus plans involved the \nbusing of black school children to the suburbs of Boston. In addition, the only mandatory busing that took place was \nbusing of black elementary school children for the short time that the Weld School was open. Although the policy had \nbeen one of voluntary busing, the parents of black students were given no choice when their children were bused \ndistances of up to two miles. \n \n12  Bradford-Walcott students (blacks) were transferred a mile and one-half to the Weld School which opened 87% black \neven though it was in a white locale. And the district court found that similar transfers, alleviating overcrowding but not \n \nimproving racial balance, were made from English High to Roosevelt and Edison Schools from 1964 to 1970. \n \n13  To some extent the use of portables to relieve overcrowding was necessitated, as noted above, by the failure to utilize \navailable seats in nearby schools. \n \n \n14  Plaintiffs assert that the court could have pointed to other examples. Defendants complain that the court ignored \nevidence or failed to make sufficiently specific findings rejecting evidence. We juxtapose these observations merely to \n \nnote that the court must make sufficient findings; it does not have to make findings on every proposition put to it by the \nparties. See 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, s 2579 (1971); Moore’s Federal Practice 52.01(5). \nMoreover, the question on appeal is whether the record as a whole supports the district court’s findings of fact. Rule 52 \nFed.R.Civ.Pro. \n \n15  Boston has 18 high schools. Nine are theoretically fed by all intermediate schools, junior highs and middle schools \nthroughout the system. Six are examination schools (discussed infra); one is a special program school; the remaining \n \ntwo are general schools, English High and Girls High. The nine remaining schools, Brighton, Burke, Charlestown, \nDorchester, East Boston, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, Roslindale and South Boston are fed only by designated \nintermediate schools. Citywide, only English and Girls High include 9th grade. Of the district high schools only East \nBoston, South Boston and Burke for girls include 9th grade. The six district schools containing grades 10, 11, and 12 \ncan be fed only by junior highs. \n \n16 \nIn 1967 Lewis and Campbell had among the highest percentages of black students of junior highs in Boston.  379 \n  F.Supp. at 444 n. 23. The change to middle schools began in 1968—1969. McCormack, previously grades 4—8, \nlocated near Columbia point, was designated a middle school as was Thompson, previously grades 1—8. \n \n17  Defendants claim that the district court’s blanket statement that no redistricting for integrative purposes took place \nindicates that the court failed to consider evidence that parts of a predominantly white district were added to the John \n \nF. Kennedy district for the purpose of improving the racial balance and the Curley Elementary School which was about \nto open, and that similar redistricting took place upon the opening of the Holland and Ohrenberger schools. We note \nthat the district court did not fail to consider these matters, but included them in its discussion of school openings. \nWhen the district court discussed redistricting, it specifically excluded from its definition the original drawing of districts \nfor new schools.  379 F.Supp. at 437. \n \n18  In 1972 Boston Latin was 2.2% black, Girls Latin was 5.0% black, and Boston Technical was 13.7% black (due in part \nto an industrial printing program run there which did not admit students on a competitive basis). \n \n \n19  The black enrollment at Boston Trade increased from 9.6% in 1967 to 65.2% in 1972. At Girls Trade the increase was \nfrom 35.7% to 68.7%. \n \n \n20  The facts with respect to the examination and trade schools and the vocational programs illustrate the logic of the first \nprinciple established in Keyes. The schools and the programs are integral parts of the educational system in Boston, \n \nfulfilling specialized roles in that system. The examination schools are segregated because black children fare worse \non the entrance examinations than whites. These children are products of the segregated elementary classes which \nconstituted ‘tracks’ to the examination schools and were more than 80% white. The predominantly white vocational \nprograms recruited primarily at white junior high schools. Thus, the segregation of the lower schools had inevitable \nconsequences for the examination and trade schools and vocational programs. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  17 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580 (1974)   \n \n \n21  As we understand Keyes, little short of a positive showing that defendants acted with integrative intent would suffice to \n  rebut the presumption of segregative intent.  Berkelman v. San Francisco Unified School District, 501 F.2d 1264 \n(9th Cir. 1974), cited by defendants, is wholly inapposite, as the court there specifically noted that there was no \nshowing of intentional segregation in the San Francisco School System to warrant the  application of Keyes. 501 \nF.2d at 1266 n. 3. \n \n22  The settlement of these charges led to the use in 1973 of examinations prepared by Educational Testing Services in \nPrinceton, N.J., and the reservation of a number of seats in the examination schools for underrepresented districts of \n \nthe city. This action has no relevance to defendants’ intent in earlier years.  Keyes, 413 U.S. at 210, 93 S.Ct. 2686. \n \n23  Defendants argue that when the Supreme Court said in Swann ‘. . . where it is possible to identify a ‘white school’ or a \n‘Negro school’ simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and staffs . . . a prima facie case of violation of \n \nsubstantive constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause is shown,’  402 U.S. at 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277, it \nreferred only to school systems in which some faculties were majority-black. We think defendants misread Swann. If \nthe Court had intended to establish a mathematical rule it could have done so explicitly. The passage quoted calls for \nus to determine what the numbers mean in the context of the case before us. Such an approach is entirely consistent \nwith that established by the Court in Keyes for the analogous determination whether a student body is segregated, \n413 U.S. at 196, 93 S.Ct. 2686. \nEven if we accepted defendants’ reading to the Swann language, it would be of little avail, for Swann simply states one \nbasis on which a constitutional violation may be found. It is silent as to the impact of findings such as the district court \nhas made in this case, that the concentration of most of the system’s black teachers in the small minority of schools \nwhich are dominantly black has resulted from segregatory policies knowingly pursued by defendants. \n \n24  About 15% of the total teaching staff in the school system were provisionals. 35% of the black teachers were \nprovisions. Provisionals are hired under an exception to the requirement that teachers in Massachusetts have teaching \n \ncertificates. They need not have taken the National Teachers Examination, nor have achieved a good score if they \nhave taken it. They are hired under one year contracts at lower pay than permanent teachers, receive tenure only if \nhired for three consecutive years, and have no rights of transfer or promotion.  379 F.Supp. at 457, 460. \n \n25  Defendants argue that the evidence does not show that the ‘rating’ system itself was segregative. We agree. We do \nnot know the number of blacks or of whites who sought to be ‘rated’, nor the success rate for either group. We do not \n \nknow what percentage of ‘rated’ blacks, as opposed to ‘rated’ whites actually received promotions. We do know that \nthe black 3.5% of the administrative staff in the school system must, as a consequence of the 4—6 year experience \nrequirement and the three year life of the ‘rated’ lists, have come from among teachers who were employed in the early \nsixties, a time when less than 3.5% of the teachers were black. \n \n26  The ‘rating’ system was suspended in 1971. The district court found that the thirty acting appointments made from \n1971 until the time of the trial had all been filled by whites. \n \n \n27  In 1972 the required score was reduced to 400, and in 1973, to 320. \n \n \n28  Defendants argue that if the NTE is somewhat related to teaching competence, its use as a part of the hiring process is \nlegitimate. The district court found, however, that the NTE was in practice the only hiring criterion, and that the use of \n \nthe ‘cutoff’ score of 560 was inherently discriminatory. See  Walston v. County School Bd. of Nansemond County, \nVa.,  492  F.2d  919  (4th  Cir.  1974),  where  the  Fourth  Circuit,  in  an  opinion  by  retired  Justice  Clark,  ruled \nunconstitutionally discriminatory an NTE ‘cutoff’ score of 500. \n \n29  Plaintiffs suggest that the denial of equal education would constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause \nindependently of any finding of racial segregation. We do not reach that question. The evidence of racial segregation in \n \nthe Boston schools is too massive to suggest that we pursue alternative theories. Equal educational opportunity has \nbeen the central theme of all of the generations of school desegregation cases beginning with Brown. \n \n30  Robert Lowell, For the Union Dead. \n \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

Law Rep. 514 \n \nFootnotes \n \n1  Throughout this opinion, we shall refer to the Boston School Committee and its president collectively as the “school \ndefendants.” \n \n \n2  By “city defendants” we mean the Mayor of the City of Boston and the director and commissioners of the Public \nFacilities Commission of the City of Boston. \n \n \n3  The order requires that the schools \n(a) shall compose enrollments at each school so that its racial/ethnic proportions shall be consistent with current \n \nguidelines which shall be derived, with respect to citywide magnet schools and programs, from the citywide public \nschool population and, with respect to district schools, from the public school populations of their current districts \nor consolidations thereof; ... \n(b) alternatively, may beginning with the 1986–87 school year or thereafter use a single, citywide guideline for \nassigning students.... \nMorgan v. Nucci, 620 F.Supp. at 215–16. Under either (a) or (b) assignment totals at a particular school may \ndiverge from the target percentages within a range determined by adding and subtracting 25 percent of the total \npercentage. Thus, if the target percentage for a particular group is 48 percent, any assignment between 36 and 60 \npercent (48 plus or minus 12) is acceptable. See  id. at 221. \nThe school defendants also appeal—on the same ground—from an unpublished order of May 24, 1985, that requires \nschools in districts 4 and 5 to reflect the district’s racial mix within a variance of ten percent. \n \n4  Subparagraph (a) of the present order is very similar in concept, although not in all its specifics, to the student \nassignment plan drawn up by the district court in 1975. The option contained in subparagraph (b) allowing student \n \nassignments to conform to citywide proportions is, however, new. \n \n5  The State Board, in an attempt to distinguish Spangler, emphasizes that the Supreme Court itself noted that its \n  decision did not involve “ ‘step at a time’ plans by definition incomplete at inception,”  Spangler, 427 U.S. at 435, 96 \nS.Ct. at 2704, the approach used for the desegregation of Boston’s public schools. By mentioning that the case did not \ninvolve a step-at-a-time plan, however, the Court was simply recognizing the unremarkable proposition that where \nsuch a plan is involved, the mere implementation of an individual court order—a “step”—does not necessitate a finding \nof unitariness. But where unitariness has been achieved, as to either the entire school system or a wholly separable \nsubset thereof, we believe Spangler is applicable regardless of what desegregation approach was employed. \nThe Board’s other attempts to distinguish Spangler—that the schools there were in “literal compliance” with the \ncourt’s orders, and that the challenged order itself provided little flexibility—similarly fail to recognize that unitariness \nitself is the touchstone of Spangler. \n \n6  While there is a literal distinction between one-race and racially identifiable schools, we follow the courts’ tendency to \nuse the phrases interchangeably. \n \n \n7  For example, blacks constitute 72 percent of the public middle school students residing in district 4. Morgan v. Nucci, \nNo. 72–911–G, slip op. at 6 (D.Mass. May 24, 1985). Obviously, for every middle school in district 4 to avoid a student \n \nbody consisting of not more than 70 percent black would be impossible, absent interdistrict busing. Moreover, staying \nbelow the 75 percent ratio, although theoretically possible, would allow for so little variance as to be impossible as a \npractical matter. It should be borne in mind, when we speak of “districts,” that these are districts that were drawn by the \ndistrict court specifically for desegregation purposes, hence they may be presumed to be based on an intensive effort \nto include, insofar as Boston’s settlement patterns will allow, a comprehensive racial mix. \n \n8  The schools are Thompson Middle (82 percent black); Wilson Middle (80 percent black); Barnes Middle (82 percent \nwhite); Cheverus Middle (91 percent white); Chittick Elementary (85 percent black); Taylor Elementary (83 percent \n \nblack); Endicott Elementary (80 percent black); Murphy Elementary (80 percent black); Adams Elementary (82 percent \nwhite); Bradley Elementary (85 percent white); Kennedy Elementary (89 percent white); and O’Donnell Elementary (84 \npercent white). \n \n9  We recognize that not all the district court’s orders have been fully implemented. For example, the school defendants \n © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  18 \n \n\n \nMorgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d 313 (1987)   \n94 A.L.R. Fed. 629, 42 Ed. Law Rep. 514 \n \n  have not complied with the court’s orders requiring active recruitment of minority faculty members. See infra Part III. \nAlthough enough to warrant the court’s retention of jurisdiction over staffing practices, this noncompliance, by itself, \ndoes not require an inference of overall bad faith. In the absence of countervailing evidence, we are likewise unable to \nsee that defendants’ failure to implement fully the special desegregation measures was indicative of bad faith. \nSee Morgan v. Nucci, No. 72–911–G, slip op. at 7–8 (D.Mass. May 24, 1985) (discussing special desegregation \nmeasures). Under these orders, the court directed that four elementary and two middle schools be the subject of \nspecial recruitment efforts to attract white students. We do not believe that this apparently isolated instance of \nnoncompliance with these orders warrants an inference of bad faith in the execution of student assignment orders. \nSee infra subsection (4). \n \n10  We  recognize  that  a  finding  of  maximum  practicable  desegregation  does  not  invariably  follow  from  the  mere \nimplementation of a desegregation order. Such an inference is more compelling, however, where, as here, the district \n \ncourt has indicated that noncompliance with details of the order is all that stands between the schools and full \ndesegregation. \n \n11  Report No. 4 contains the most recent enrollment figures in the record. \n \n \n12  School  Court-Ordered  Actual White \n     \n \n  White Range  Enrollment \n   \nMadison Park  21%-31%  19% \n     \n     \nEnglish High  21%-31%  20% \n     \n     \nBurke High  13%-23%  12% \n     \n13    School  Court-Ordered  Actual Black \n     \n \n  Black Range  Enrollment \n   \nWheatley  48%-54%  57% \n     \n     \nUmana  48%-54%  56% \n     \n     \nLewenberg  41%-69%  77% \n     \n14    School  Court-Ordered  Actual White \n     \n \n  White Range  Enrollment \n   \nT.

We do not consider any of \nthese contentions sufficient to warrant further court supervision over the assignment process, especially in light of the \nevidence showing the substantial desegregation present in the Boston schools. \n \n19  We have no reason to question the good faith of the present Boston school officials, see supra, or to doubt that the \nreturn to local autonomy will do anything but preserve the gains the schools have made over the past 15 years. \n \nNevertheless, if unforeseen circumstances should ever necessitate a return trip to federal court by school plaintiffs, we \nnote without deciding the possibility that the history of this litigation might militate for some modification of plaintiffs’ \nevidentiary burden. See generally Note, Allocating the Burden of Proof After a Finding of Unitariness in School \nDesegregation Litigation, 100 Harv.L.Rev. 653 (1987). \n \n20  By 1981, blacks made up 19.09 percent of all teachers and 20.53 percent of school administrators.

O’Bryant, 671 F.2d 23, 24 n. 2 (1st Cir.1982). \n \n22  The court subsequently added to paragraph 5 the requirement that the school defendants attain “at each of the three \nexamination schools, a 25% black faculty within five years; and a 10% other minority faculty.” \n \n \n23  The Union does not only attack paragraph 5 as beyond the court’s power, but attacks all the other so-called “final” \norders as similarly beyond the court’s power. We only discuss paragraph 5, however, because the Union’s right to \n \nintervene extended exclusively to faculty and staff issues. See Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 599, 600 (1st Cir.1975). \n \n24 \nThe order required that no school in the school district have a majority of any minority students.  Spangler, 427 U.S. \n  at 428, 96 S.Ct. at 2701. \n \n25  Although nothing in the orders of disengagement specifically provides for the court’s terminating jurisdiction over \nparticular aspects of the schools, as compared to the entire system, upon a showing of unitary status, we have no \n \ndoubt that if the BTU or any defendant demonstrated complete compliance with all outstanding faculty and staff orders, \nthe court would withdraw entirely from the school’s staffing decisions. See  Pasadena City Board of Education v. \nSpangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436–37, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2704–05, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976). \n \n26  We sanctioned the 25 percent figure as an appropriate remedial target in Morgan v. O’Bryant, 671 F.2d 23, 27–29 (1st \nCir.1982); Morgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 431, 434 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 2649, 49 L.Ed.2d 386 \n \n(1976). \nIn Morgan v. Nucci, 612 F.Supp. 1060, 1062 (D.Mass.1985), the district court concluded it had the power to “enter \norders with respect to the employment of Hispanic and other minority faculty no less than its jurisdiction to enter \norders regarding the employment of black faculty.” No one, including the Union, appealed from these orders; nor \ndoes the Union contend it did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue whether “other minorities” were \nwithin the district court’s remedial purview. See generally  Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153–54, 99 \nS.Ct. 970, 973–74, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979) (discussing preclusion). \n \n27  The relevant portion of paragraph 5 orders the school defendants to increase “the proportions of black faculty and \nadministrative staff at a rate of not less than one half percent annually and the proportion of other minority faculty at the \n \nrate of not less than one quarter percent annually, and of other minority administrative staff in accordance with the \nparties’ agreement for a one out of three hiring ratio,” until the 25 percent black and 10 percent other minority goals are \nachieved. \n \n28  The court found that if its percentage increases were obeyed, paragraph 5 would be fully implemented by 1993–94. \nMoreover, the court believed that because of annual turnover, discharges would be required in only one year.
