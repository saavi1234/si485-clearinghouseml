A Three-Judge Court May(cid:9) 20\nConsider Issues Ancillary\nand Related to a Constitutional\nAttack on a Statute\nAppendix A\n\nSTATEMENT\nThe Taliaferro County Board of Education\nmaintained and operated a dual segregated school\nsystem for the 1965-1965 school year. Negro students\nattended one school, Murden, which was staffed ex-\nclusively by Negro personnel; white students attended\nanother school, Alexander Stephens Institute, which\nwas staffed exclusively by white personnel. Grades\none through twelve were offered at each school.\nAlexander Stephens Institute had a gymnasium;\nMurden did not. Mrs. Lola Williams is the County\nSuperintendent of Education. Her office is in the\nCounty Courthouse, on the town square.\nDuring the Fall of 1964, a group of Negro\nadults and children requested that the one gymnasium\nbe made available for their use; the School Board denied\nthis request. Again, in May, 1965, a similar request\nwas made and denied.\nThe hiring of teachers for the 1965-66 school\nyear was conducted during the Spring of 1965. Teachers\nwho would be assigned to Alexander Stephens Institute\nsigned their contracts at this time; six of the teachers\nwho had taught at Murden School in the 1964-65 school\nyear were notified that their contracts would not be\nrenewed for the 1965-1966 school year.\n\nOn May 3, 1965, the Taliaferro County Board of\nEducation submitted a plan for desegregation of schools\nto the Office of Education, Department of Health, Educa-\ntion and Welfare. Atโขthe Board of Education meeting\non August 2, 1965, the Board noted in its minutes that\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nnotified it to improve the plan but the Board decided\nto rely on its plan of May 3, 1965.\nGroups of Negro and civil rights workers began\nholding demonstrations in May, 1965,and these demon-\nstrations continued throughout the summer. On Sun-\ndays, the usual practice was for the protestors to\nmeet at the Friendship Baptist Church, march to the\ntown square, where they sang songs and prayed, after\nwhich they marched back to the church. On some occasions\ndemonstrations occurred near the office of Mrs. Williams\nand at her home. Some of the songs which the demon-\nstrators sang mentioned her name.\nDuring July 1965, forms by which Negro children\ncould transfer to Alexander Stephens Institute were\nmade available by the school officials. On July 13,\n14, and 15, the Board received 89 applications for\nthe transfer of Negro students to Alexander Stephens\nInstitute. Beginning on July 15, the last day for\n\nthe submission of transfer formโขtthe School Board\nattorney, Harold Richards, Sheriff Moore and agents\nof the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began an in-\nvestigation of alleged irregularities in the submission\nof the 89 choice forms. Mrs. Williams consulted with\nMr. Richards about this investigation. Also in July,\n1965 Mrs. Williams contacted Mr. Ford Boston, the\nSuperintendent of Greene County Schools, concerning\nthe transfer of students to Greene County. At this\ntime Mr. Boston thought that ,7,radcs 8 through 12 would\nnot be operated at Alexander Stephens Institute the\nfollowing year. On July 22-23, 1965 the Warren County\nBoard of Education received a large number of applica-\ntions from students who previously attended Alexander\nStephens Institute to attend schools in that county\nduring the 1965-1966 school year. On August 5, the\nWarren County Board approved the hiring of four teachers\nwho had taught at Alexander Stephens Institute in 1964-\n1965 and who had, in the Spring of 1965, agreed to\nteach in Taliaferro County the following year. On\nAugust 6, the Warren County Board approved the trans-\nfers of students who previously attended Alexander\nStephens Institute.\nAlso, during July, 1965, County and School Board\nAttorney Harold Richards caused three warrants to be\nissued against Calvin Turner for violation of Georgia\nCode, Section 26-3914. Mr. Turner taught in the Murden\nSchool during the 1964-1965 school year but his contract\nwas not renewed for the 1965-1966 school year. He is\n\none of the teachers who assisted Negro children in\ntheir request to use the Alexander Stephen Institute's\ngymnasium, during the 1964-1965 school year, he is\na leader of the Taliaferro County civil rights move-\nment, and is a parent who requested that his children\nattend Alexander Stephens Institute during the 1965-1966\nschool year. The warrants were issued for alleged\nforgeries concerning the filing of requests for four\nNegro students to attend Alexander Stephens Institute.\nMr. Turner was released on bond pending the meeting of\nthe Taliaferro County Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, on\nor shortly after August 31, 1965, returned three in-\ndictments, of four counts each, charging Calvin Turner\nwith violations of the Georgia forgery statute, in con-\nnection with the school transfer application forms filed\non behalf of Negro students to attend Alexander Stephens\nInstitute. Calvin Turner is also a Notary Public and\nacted as such on the applications filed on behalf\nof Negro children to attend Alexander Stephens Instithte.\nOn Sunday, August 22, 1965, about 125 Negroes\nand a few white civil rights workers marched together\nto the Taliaferro County Courthouse from the Friend-\nship Baptist Church to protest racial inequalities in\nTaliaferro County. Another group led by Reverend\nWhitney Ward and a group of his white followers, were\nalso at or near the Courthouse square. They had a\nloudspeaker over which records were played. Both\ngroups conducted their programs simultaneously at\ndifferent places on the square. On the following day,\n4\n\nCounty Attorney Richards met with Solicitor General\nKenneth Goolsby and gave to Mr. Goolsby a copy of a\nletter that Reverend Ward had provided Mr. Richards.\nThe letter concerned the alleged interference of Rever-\nend Ward's meeting at the Courthouse on August 22,\nby the Negro demonstration. Later that day, Sheriff\nMoore arrested Calvin Turner, and the Reverend Joseph\nCooney, a civil rights worker from the District of\nColumbia, for violation of Georgia Code 26-6901,\ndisturbing divine worship.\nThe regular session of the Taliaferro County\nGrand Jury was scheduled to meet on August 23, 1965.\nIt was not convened but met instead on August 30, 1965,\nafter the names of Negroes were added to the jury list.\nThe grand jury indicted nine persons for violating\nGeorgia Code Section 26-6901, disturbing divine worship.\nThe indictments charged that the conduct of the Negro\ndemonstrators at the Courthouse square on August 22,\n1965, disturbed a divine worship, conducted by Reverend\nWard. The Grand Jury also indicted Calvin Turner,\nClara and Dock Davis, and Edna Swain of five counts of\nforgery arising out of the submission of applications\nfor transfer to attend Alexander Stephens Institute on\nbehalf of Negro children, in July 1965. Mr. Calvin\nTurner was confined in jail from about August 31, 1965,\nuntil at least September 10, 1965, for failure to post\n$17,750 bond which was set following his arrest for\nviolating the Georgia divine worship and forgery statutes.\n5\n\nThe 1965-66 school year began on August 30, 1965\nin Taliaferro County, Georgia. No white students appeared\nat Alexander Stephens Institute. Taliaferro County\nprovided public school bus transportation for the\nwhite students to attend classes in Warren, Wilkes,\nand Greene Counties, Georgia. Negro students who had\nrequested transfers to Alexander Stephens Institute\nwere unable to attend because the school was not\noperated. To protest the closing, Negro students, in\nSeptember and October, 1965, attempted to board, and\nplaced themselves in the path of the buses which\ntransported the white Taliaferro County students to\nWarren,. Wilkes, and Greene Counties. Beginning September\n10, and ending on October 12, 1965, a series of four\ndemonstrations occurred at the Murden School, during\none of which a list of grievances was presented to the\nprincipal by representatives of the Negro demonStratorsi\nPlaintiff filed the complaint in the instant\naction on September 10, 1965, alleging that Georgia\nCode 26-6901 concerning disturbance of divine worship,\nis unconstitutional, that Georgia Code 26-3914, the\nGeorgia foregery statute, is unconstitutional, and in\nCount III, that, in general, defendants have conspired\nto deny plaintiffs their civil rights,\nCount III incorporates by reference the allegations\nof Counts I and II, alleges that the acts of defendant\nGoolsby were committed in furtherance of a conspiracy\nin violation of 28 U.S.C. 1985(3), and alleges that the\nTaliaferro County Sheriff, Milton Moore, the County\n6\n\nAttorney, Harold F. Richards; the County Superin-\ntendent of Schools, Mrs. Lola Williams; the members\nof the County Board of Education; and the Solicitor\nGeneral of the Toombs Judicial Circuit, Kenneth E.\nGoolsby, are co-conspirators, who have combined and\nconspired under color of state law to deprive the\nplaintiffs and the member-of their class of the equal\nprotection of the laws or of privileges and immunities\nunder the federal Constitution and statutes. Specifically,\nit is alleged that, among other things, the\nTaliaferro County school officials refused to rehire\nsix teachers who assented to a request on behalf of\nNegro students to use the one gymnasium in the county;\nthat the Taliaferro County school officials arranged\nfor the education of white students, but not Negro stu-\ndents, in the schools of the surrounding counties; that\ncertain defendants caused civil rights workers to be\nchased, to be deprived of guaranteed rights, and\nthreatened; that defendant Richards caused warrants\nto be signed by Negro citizens against Calvin Turner\non the charge of forgery, in 'furtherance of the con-\nspiracy; and that defendant Goolsby by presenting evidence\nto the grand jury caused indictments to be returned\nagainst Calvin Turner and the Reverend Joseph Cooney\nfor violating Georgia Code 26-6901 and by participating\nin the transfer of the 112 white students to schools\nin the adjoining counties acted to further the conspiracy.\nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of\nGeorgia Code Sections 26-6901 and 26-3914; and that\n7\n\nthe defendants, be enjoined from, among other things,\nconspiring to use or in any way using their authority-to\nharass, intimidate, impede or prevent the plaintiffs\nfrom exercising their rights, privileges and immunities\nas citizens of the United States; that certain de-\nfendants be enjoined from interferring by violence,\nthreats, or arrests and threats of arrest or prosecutions\nwith plaintiff's assembling, marching and demonstrating\nat reasonable times; and that defendant Sheriff Moore\nbe enjoined from failing to provide demonstrators with\nadequate police protection and that the defendants Lola\nWilliams and the Taliaferro County Board of Education\nbe enjoined from using public monies to support students\nresiding outside of Taliaferro County unless all stu-\ndents have the privilege of attending these schools.\nCount 'IV was added by amendment on October\n11, 1965, It adds several Negro students and parents\nas plaintiff and adds the superintendents and members\nof the Boards of Education of Warren and Greene Counties\nas defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the newly added\ndefendants agreed and arranged with certain other\ndefendants to enroll the former Alexander Stephens\nInstitute students in their respective school systems.\nPlaintiff seeks to enjoin the Taliaferro County School\nofficials from operating a segregated school system and\nfrom continuing to educate white Taliaferro County\nstudents in schools in the surrounding counties and\nseeks to enjoin the other defendants from accepting\nand educating these students. In the alternative, plaintiff\n\nrequests that the court require the reorganiza-\ntion of the Taliaferro County school system into a\nunitary non-racial system, including the assignment\nof children, staff, and faculty on a non-racial\nbasis.\nThe United States of America, on January 12,\n1966 filed a motion to intervene under the provisions\nof Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\nRult. 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures.\nLimited leave to intervene was granted at the hearing\non February 23, 1966.\n9\n\nARGUMENT\nJOINDER OF CLAIMS\nAND PARTIES IS PROPER\nA. The Requirement That All Claims\nAsserted Against Defendants Must\nArise Out Of One Transaction Or\nSeries of Transactions Is\nSatisfied.\nDefendants have filed several motions in this\naction regarding the propriety of the three-judge court\nto hear and decide issues relating to the desegregation\nof the public schools of the four counties along with\nthe questions of the constitutionality of the two sec-\ntions of the Georgia Code. Attachment A to this brief\ncontains a synopsis of the motions on these issues.\nThs issues raised are whether there is proper\njoinder of the several parties and claims under Rule\n18, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and whether the\nthree-judge court should hear and decide the matters\nraised in the four counts of plaintiff's complaint. In\norder to determine whether, in this instance where there\nare multiple parties to an action and multiple claims, if\neach are properly joined, it is necessary to determine\nif the requirements of Rulesl8 and 20, Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, are satisfied.\n0\n- 1  -\n\nRule 18, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, pro-\nvides that a plaintiff may join, either as independent\nor as alternate claims as many claims as he may have\nagainst an opposing party. Similar joinder of claims\nis permitted when there are multiple parties if the\nrequirements of joinder of parties are met. Rule 20,\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, permits joinder of\ndefendants if there is asserted against them jointly,\nseverally, or in the alternative, any right to relief\narising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or\nseries of transactions or occurrences, and if any\nquestion of law or fact common to all of them will\narise in the action.\nIn order to properly join claims and to\nproperly join parties it must be shown first, that there\nis asserted against the multiple defendants a right to\nrelief in respect of or arising out of the same trans-\naction, occurrence, or series of transactions or\noccurrences. In this proceeding, the common transaction\nor series of transactions are the acts of the several\ndefendants to prevent Negro students from attending de-\nsegregated schools. These acts are alleged in Count III\n1/\nto constitute a conspiracy.(cid:9) There is no requirement\nthat the transaction or series of transactions be limited\nto a particular span of time; the determination of\n1/ Clearly the conspiracy and the acts of each individual\npursuant to it arise out of \"the same transaction,\noccurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.\"\nSee Eastern Fireproofing_ Co., v. United States \nGypsum Co., 160 F.Supp. 580 (D.C. Mass., 1958).\n\nwhether the acts of the defendants are part of the same\ntransaction or series of transactions must be determined\nfrom the facts in each case.\nIn this proceeding, the four counts of the com-\nplaint, as amended, all relate to a same transaction or\nseries of transactions, the acts of the several defen-\ndants to prevent or discourage Negro citizens of\nTaliaferro County from exercising certain constitu-\ntionally guaranteed rights, including the right to attend\ndesegregated schools. Count III of the complaint in-\ncorporates the allegations of Counts I and II and in\nCount IV, it is alleged, in essence, that by maintaining \nsegregated schools, the defendants continued to give \nforce and effect to the events which occurred which pre-\nvented Negro students from attending desegregated schools.\nThe events which show the existence of the\ncommon transaction or series of transactions, as set\nforth in the facts above are:\n1. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nand the members of the\nTaliaferro County Board of\nEducation in the Spring of\n1965 refused to rehire six\nNegro teachers at Murden\nSchool;\n- 12 -\n\n1\n2. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nand the members of the\nTaliaferro County Board of\nEducation during the 1964-\n1965 school year refused\nto permit Negroes to use\nthe Alexander Stephens\nInstitute gymnasium;\n3. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nthe members of the Taliaferro\nCounty Board of Education, and\nMr. Richards, Mr. Goolsby, and\nSheriff Moore, in July 1965,\ninstituted an investigation of\napplications for transfer by\nNegroes to Alexander Stephens\nInstitute, and, investigated\nand initiated the prosecution\nof Calvin Turner for forgery,\nunder Georgia Code 26-3914;\n4. The defendants, Mrs. LTilliams,\nthe superintendents of the\nGreene, Warren, and Wilkes\nCounty Boards of Education\nand the Boards of Education\nof Warren, Wilkes, Greene,\nand Taliaferro Counties\narranged for the transfer\n- 13 -\n\nof white students who attended\nAlexander Stephens Institute in\n1964-1965 to the schools in\nWarren, Wilkes, and Greene\nCounties for the 1965-1966\nschool year;\n5. The defendants, Sheriff Moore,\nMr. Richards, and Mr. Goolsby\nsought indictments for viola-\ntion of the divine worship\nstatute (Georgia Code\n26-6901) of members of the\ncivil rights movement who\nwere promoting, among other\nrights, the desegregation of\nTaliaferro County Public\nSchools;\n6. The defendants, the superin-\ntendents and the members of\nthe Boards of Education of\nthe Warren, Wilkes, Greene,\nand Taliaferro Counties,\nwhile arranging for the\ntransfer of white students\nto the schools in Warren,\nWilkes, and Greene Counties,\nfailed to notify Negro stu-\ndents residing in Taliaferro\n- 14 -\n\nCounty of their right\nand of the opportunity to\nmake such transfers;\n7. All of the defendants have\nperpetuated the racial segre-\ngation of the public school\nsystem of Taliaferro County.\nThus, it is clear that the claims in this case\narise out of common occurrence or series of transactions,\nnamely the efforts of the defendants to avoid the de-\nsegregation of public schools in Taliaferro County.\n\nB. There are questions of law and fact common to \nall parties.\nIn our view, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nRules 18 and 20, authorize the joinder of multiple claims\nand multiple parties when the claims arise \"out of the\nsame transaction or occurrence or series of transactions\nor occurrences\" and there is a question of law common to\n2/\nall defendants.\nIt is clear from the evidence in this proceeding\nthat, apart from the question of a conspiracy, there is\nat least one question of fact in this case which is\ncommon to all defendants. This question is whether\nthe defendants sought to prevent Negro children from\nattending desegregated public schools in Taliaferro\nCounty. This question of fact is common to all of the\nparties.\nBecause the defendants in this proceeding are\nall agents of the State and have all acted with a\ncommon purpose, they must be deemed to have acted in\nconcert.\n2/ Indeed, the proposed revision of the Federal Rules\nmakes this principle explicit. See Amendments to Rules \nof Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts,\nUnited States Supreme Court, February 28, 1966, Rules 18\nand 20. This is also the position taken in 2 Barron and\nHoltzoff, (Wright ed.) 033.1. But see Moore, Federal \nPractice 1810-13 (0_8.04 [3]).\n- 16 -\n\nThis is not a case involving private individuals\nunrelated in fact or law to each other; it is a case in-\nvolving a group of local officials who are agents of the\nState of Georgia carrying out a single purpose in a re-\nlated series of acts. There is a question of law common\nto all defendants -- whether their action in seeking to\nprevent Negroes from attending desegregated public schools\nin Taliaferro County are in violation of the Constitution.\nIt makes no difference that there are some questions of\nlaw, such as the validity of the divine worship statute,\nwhich are not common to all defendants and are not common\nto all plaintiffs. Rule 20 provides that the relief heed\nnot be the same for or against all parties. It states,\n.  plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in\nf t%. \nobtaining or defending against all the relief demanded.\nJudgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs\naccording to their respective rights to relief, and\nagainst one or more of the defendants according to their\nrespective liabilities.\"\nThe prosecution of Negroes engaged in desegrega-\ntion activities and the defendants' dodging of desegre-\ngation by sending white children to other counties are\nrelated acts and a part of an overall policy. If any\none of these defendants was sued for his role in this\nscheme, the evidence of the related acts of all the\nother defendants would be essential to proof of the\nclaim.\n- 17 -\n\nThis is a class action and private plaintiffs\nare all members of class. They assert in Count III\nthat all defendants have acted in concert to deprive\nthem and the members of their class of rights secured\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States.\nThus, this claim involves a question of law common to\nall parties.\n\nTHIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND\nDECIDE ALL ISSUES IN THIS PROCEEDING\nA. This Court Has Jurisdiction To Hear\nAnd Decide The Issues Of The Unconยป.\nstitutionality Of State Statutes\nWhen a complaint seeks an injunction against\nthe enforcement of a state statute on the grounds of\nunconstitutionality the case must be heard and determined\nby a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281\net. seq., LIE. Florida  Lime and Avocate Growers, Inc.\nv. Jacobson, 362 U.S. 73 (1960), Ex Parte Bransford,\nsupra. The Court in its order of October 22, 1965, held\nthat Georgia Code 26-6901, the divine worship statute, is\nunconstitutional as applied, and reserved the ques-\ntion of facial unconstituionality for final hearing.\nIt enjoined prosecution under Georgia Code 26.0914,\nthe forgery statute, and the ultimate determination\nof its constitutionality is pending before the Court.\n\nB. A Three-Judge Court May Consider \nIssues Ancillary and Related to\nA Constitutional Attack on A\nState Statute.\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"[w]here a\ncomplaint seeks to enjoin a state statute on sub-\nstantial grounds of federal unconstitutionality,\nthen even though nonconstitutional grounds of\nattack are also alleged, we think the case is one\nthat is 'required by . . . Act of Congress to be\nheard and determined by a district court of three \njudges.\" (Emphasis by the court). Florida Lime and \nAvocado Growers, Inc., v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 85\n(1960). See also Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965). In\nSterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932,), the court\nstated that the jurisdiction of a properly constituted\nthree-judge court \"extends to every question involved,\nwhether of state or federal law, and enables the court\nto rest its judgment on the decision of such of the\nquestions as in its opinion effectively dispose of the\ncase.\" 287 U.S. at 393. Thus, it is clear that a\nthree-judge court which is properly convened can hear\nand determine issues which do not in themselves justify\n3_/\na three-judge court.\n3/ The I.C.C. three-judge court cases are not in point.\nThey arise under 28 U.S.C.ยง2325, which has been construed\nto prohibit the joinder with a valid three-judge claim\nwith a one-judge claim seeking the same relief. E.g.,\nPittsburgh & W.V.R. Co. v. United States, 281 U.S. 479\n(1930). See also Neu York Securities Co. v. United States,\n287 U.S. 12 (1932) and Powell v. United States, 300 U.S. 276\n(1937). It is clear that three-judge courts convened.\n- 20 -\n\nMoreover, a Section 2281 three-judge court is\nnot limited to considering constitutional and non-\nconstitutional claims which both seek relief from\nenforcement of a statute. In White v. Crook, Civil\nAction No. 2263 (N.D., Ala., 1966) a three-judge court\nconsisting of Judges Rives, Allgood, and Johnson,\nheard and determined a constitutional challenge to\nan Alabama statute limiting jury service to men, joined\nwith a claim that the defendants had systematically\nexcluded Negroes from jury service. The latter claim\ndid not seek an injunction against a state statute's\nenforcement. ,and would not therefore justify a three-\njudge court in its own right.\n3/ (con't.) pursuant to 28 U.S.C.ยง2281 are not subject\nto the limitations of three-judge courts convened pur-\nsuant to 28 U.S.C.2325, since a 28 U.S.C.ยง2281 Court\nmay hear all challenges to a statute, non-constitutional\nas well as ccnstitutional. Florida Lime and Avocado\nGrowers v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73 (1960). However, the\nmost recent case dealing with the jurisdiction of a\nยง2325 Court, held that a three-judge court could consider\nboth a claim seeking review of an I.C.C. rate order (a\nthree-judge claim) and an issue arising under the anti-\ntrust laws. There the non-three-judge claim did not\nseek the same relief as the three-judge claim. The\nCourt held that since the issues in the two claims were\n\"inextricably emmeshed l it could hear them both. Cf.\nalso Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258 (1924).\n- 21 -\n\nThe only case cited by defendants which is\nsimilar in its facts to the case at hand and arises\nunder the same jurisdictional statute is Public\nService Commission of Missouri v. Brashear Freight \nLines, 312 U.S. 621 (1941). There a three-judge court\n* acted upon a claim of unconstitutionality of a state\ntax law and a counter-claim for assessment of money\ndamages. The court did not hold that the three-judge\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to try the case but\nheld that the non-three-judge claim was properly\nappealed to the Court of Appeals on the merits.\nThis indicates that the three-judge court's exercise\nof jurisdiction was permissable. See generally,\nKurland, The Romero Case and  Some Problems of Federal \nJurisdiction, 73 Harv.  L. Rev. 817, 836-41 (1960).\nDefendant's reliance on Hurn v. Oursler, 289\nU.S. 238 (1933) 9 and related cases involving the\ndoctrine of pendant jurisdiction is unfounded. The\npendant jurisdiction rule as outlined in these cases\nis concerned with the issue of a federal court hearing\nand deciding state causes of action. Under the rule\nof those cases a federal court has jurisdiction over a\nstate cause of action only if it is predicated upon the\nsame fact pattern which gave rise to the federal claim\nbefore the court. Thus, a federal court is without\njurisdiction to determine a state cause of action not\npredicated upon a set of facts which also gave rise to\na federal claim. The rationale of this rule is founded\n- 22 -\n\nupon constitutional notions of federalism and the hesitancy\nof the federal courts to invade the domain of state law.\nSee generally, Hart and Wechsler, The Federal  Courts and\nthe Federal System, pp. 794, 797-809. In this proceeding\nthis Court is presented with an entirely different issue.\nA state claim is not alleged and problems of federalism\n4/\nand abstention are not present.\n4/ Even if the analcgy urged by defendants is appropriate,\ndefendants have too strictly construed the distinction\nbetween \"two distinct grounds in support of a single cause\nof action\" and \"two distinct causes of action.\" Applying\nthe rule of Hurn v. Oursler, the 7th Circuit has upheld\nthe joinder of claims alleging 1) patent infringement,\nand 2) breach of a covenant not to infringe the patent.\nEven though the patent was held invalid, the Court said\nthat the second issue should be decided on the merits. It\nheld the patent relevant to the second claim (arising under\nstate law) only to describe the article not to be \"infringed\"\nby the defendant. The \"single cause of action\" requirement\nwas satisfied here by the overlapping of the evidence which\nhad to be presented on each claim. United Lens Corp. v.\nDoray Lamp, Inc., 93 F. 2d 969 (7th Cir. 1937) (alternative\nholding).\n- 23 -\n\nIn the three-judge court situation, the primary\nconsideration is that of judicial economy. It is ap-\nparent that severance as requested by the defendants\nwould place an added burden on the court system.\nCounts I and II would be heard by a three-judge court,\nCounts III and IV by a single judge. Assuming each\ncase ran the gamut of review, the latter would be ap-\npealed to a circuit court. Two separate appeals to\nthe Supreme Court would be necessary. Moreover, as\nhas been discussed previously, much of the proof rele-\nvant to Counts I and II would be repeated in the hearing\non Count III, since I and II are alleged as part of the\nCount III conspiracy. Also, much of the other evidence\nadduced under Count III would be duplicated on the\ntrials of Counts t and II, to show the purpose of the\napplication of the statutes. Clearly the case in its\npresent posture prevents needless duplication and repetition.\nThus, it is apparent that this Court has jurisdiction\nnot only to decide the questions of the constitutionality\nof the state statutes, but has jurisdiction to decide all\nissues in the proceeding.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is our contention that the claims\nand parties were properly joined under the provisions\nof Rules d8 and 20, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThe requirements of joinder have clearly been satisfied.\nIt is also clear that this Court, a Three Judge District\nCourt must, under 18 U.S.C. 2281, hear and decide\nthe questions of the constitutionality of the Georgia\ncriminal statutes, the disturbance of divine worship statute\n(Georgia Code 26-6901) and the Georgia forgery statute\n(26-3914). It is likewise clear that this Court\nshould hear and decide all of the issues and matters\nalleged and presented in this proceeding.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN HEDIAND.,\nCARL GABEL,\nAttorneys,\nDepartment of Justice,\nWashington, D. C. 20530\n\nAPPENDIX A\nMotions concerning the issues ofioinder\nand jurisdiction of the Three\nJudge District Court to hear and\ndecide the issues raised in the \nfour counts of the  Complaints. \n1. October 5, 1965\nDefendants Kenneth B. Goolsby and Milton B.\nMoore moved to require plaintiffs to file an amended\ncomplaint stating in separate counts each of seven\nalleged claims for relief in Count III of the com-\nplaint and for an order severing the claims sought to\nbe asserted against Goolsby and Moore from the claims\nsought to be asserted against other defendants. They\ncontended that defendants Goolsby and Moore have no\nauthority over the operation of schools in Taliaferro\nCounty, that the alleged claims against Goolsby and\nMoore do not arise out of the same transactions as\nclaims against other defendants; that undue expense\nto Goolsby and Moore would occur and that the issues\nwill be confused by joint trial of claims against two\ngroups of defendants.\n2. October 5, 1965\nLola Williams, Superintendent of Schools,\nTaliaferro County, and members of the Board of Education\nTaliaferro County, moved for an order dropping them\nas parties defendant or in the alternative for an order\nsevering claims asserted against them from claims asserted\nagainst defendants Goolsby, Moore and Richards.\n\n3. November 16, 1965\nThe members of Wilkes County Board of Education\nand Wilkes County Superintendent of Schools,. M.-A. Guill\nmoved to dismiss the complaint because:\n1. The complaint fails to state a cause\nof action upon which relief can be\ngranted, and\n2. Trial was held on October 12, 13, 14\nwhen defendants were not present; had\nnot been served with process; and were\nwithout notice the matter was proceeding\nagainst them,\nThe defendants additionally moved:\n1. To dismiss and strike Counts I and II\nof the complaint in that said counts\nrelate wholly to matters concerning\nTaliaferro County,\n2. To dismiss Count III in that Count III\ncontains a multiplicity of actions,\n3. To dismiss Counts III and IV of complaint\nin that defendant had no opportunity to\ndefend and had no notice of trial of the\ncase, and\n4. To dismiss and vacate the order of the\nCourt dated October 19, 1965 as to them,\nin that said order was granted ex parte \nwhen they had no notice advising that they\nwere parties.\nii\n\n4. February 15, 1966\nThe members of the Wilkes County Board of Education\nand its Superintendent moved to:\n1. Sever claims and parties set forth in\nCounts I and II of plaintiff's complaint\nfrom claims and parties set forth in\nCounts III and IV and that CountsI and II\nbe proceeded with separately from\nCounts III and IV, and\n2. That Counts I and II be heard by a\ndistrict court consisting of three judges\nand Counts III and IV by a district\ncourt consisting of a single judge for\nthe reason that a three-judge court\ndoes not have jurisdiction over Counts\nIII and IV which are the only counts\ninvolving Wilkes County defendants.\n5. February 15, 1966\nA Motion by Wilkes County defendants to strike\nportions of numerous paragraphs in the complaint as\nbeing irrelevant and immaterial.\n6. February 23, 1966\nMotion by Warren County defendants to:\n1. Sever Counts I and II from Counts III and\nIV and that Counts I and II be dealt Tyith\nseparately from Counts III and.IV.\n2.

Negro students\nattended one school, Murden, which was staffed ex-\nclusively by Negro personnel; white students attended\nanother school, Alexander Stephens Institute, which\nwas staffed exclusively by white personnel. Grades\none through twelve were offered at each school.\nAlexander Stephens Institute had a gymnasium;\nMurden did not. Mrs. Lola Williams is the County\nSuperintendent of Education. Her office is in the\nCounty Courthouse, on the town square.\nDuring the Fall of 1964, a group of Negro\nadults and children requested that the one gymnasium\nbe made available for their use; the School Board denied\nthis request. Again, in May, 1965, a similar request\nwas made and denied.\nThe hiring of teachers for the 1965-66 school\nyear was conducted during the Spring of 1965. Teachers\nwho would be assigned to Alexander Stephens Institute\nsigned their contracts at this time; six of the teachers\nwho had taught at Murden School in the 1964-65 school\nyear were notified that their contracts would not be\nrenewed for the 1965-1966 school year.\n\nOn May 3, 1965, the Taliaferro County Board of\nEducation submitted a plan for desegregation of schools\nto the Office of Education, Department of Health, Educa-\ntion and Welfare. Atโขthe Board of Education meeting\non August 2, 1965, the Board noted in its minutes that\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nnotified it to improve the plan but the Board decided\nto rely on its plan of May 3, 1965.\nGroups of Negro and civil rights workers began\nholding demonstrations in May, 1965,and these demon-\nstrations continued throughout the summer. On Sun-\ndays, the usual practice was for the protestors to\nmeet at the Friendship Baptist Church, march to the\ntown square, where they sang songs and prayed, after\nwhich they marched back to the church. On some occasions\ndemonstrations occurred near the office of Mrs. Williams\nand at her home. Some of the songs which the demon-\nstrators sang mentioned her name.\nDuring July 1965, forms by which Negro children\ncould transfer to Alexander Stephens Institute were\nmade available by the school officials. On July 13,\n14, and 15, the Board received 89 applications for\nthe transfer of Negro students to Alexander Stephens\nInstitute. Beginning on July 15, the last day for\n\nthe submission of transfer formโขtthe School Board\nattorney, Harold Richards, Sheriff Moore and agents\nof the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began an in-\nvestigation of alleged irregularities in the submission\nof the 89 choice forms. Mrs. Williams consulted with\nMr. Richards about this investigation. Also in July,\n1965 Mrs. Williams contacted Mr. Ford Boston, the\nSuperintendent of Greene County Schools, concerning\nthe transfer of students to Greene County. At this\ntime Mr. Boston thought that ,7,radcs 8 through 12 would\nnot be operated at Alexander Stephens Institute the\nfollowing year. On July 22-23, 1965 the Warren County\nBoard of Education received a large number of applica-\ntions from students who previously attended Alexander\nStephens Institute to attend schools in that county\nduring the 1965-1966 school year. On August 5, the\nWarren County Board approved the hiring of four teachers\nwho had taught at Alexander Stephens Institute in 1964-\n1965 and who had, in the Spring of 1965, agreed to\nteach in Taliaferro County the following year. On\nAugust 6, the Warren County Board approved the trans-\nfers of students who previously attended Alexander\nStephens Institute.\nAlso, during July, 1965, County and School Board\nAttorney Harold Richards caused three warrants to be\nissued against Calvin Turner for violation of Georgia\nCode, Section 26-3914. Mr. Turner taught in the Murden\nSchool during the 1964-1965 school year but his contract\nwas not renewed for the 1965-1966 school year. He is\n\none of the teachers who assisted Negro children in\ntheir request to use the Alexander Stephen Institute's\ngymnasium, during the 1964-1965 school year, he is\na leader of the Taliaferro County civil rights move-\nment, and is a parent who requested that his children\nattend Alexander Stephens Institute during the 1965-1966\nschool year. The warrants were issued for alleged\nforgeries concerning the filing of requests for four\nNegro students to attend Alexander Stephens Institute.\nMr. Turner was released on bond pending the meeting of\nthe Taliaferro County Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, on\nor shortly after August 31, 1965, returned three in-\ndictments, of four counts each, charging Calvin Turner\nwith violations of the Georgia forgery statute, in con-\nnection with the school transfer application forms filed\non behalf of Negro students to attend Alexander Stephens\nInstitute. Calvin Turner is also a Notary Public and\nacted as such on the applications filed on behalf\nof Negro children to attend Alexander Stephens Instithte.\nOn Sunday, August 22, 1965, about 125 Negroes\nand a few white civil rights workers marched together\nto the Taliaferro County Courthouse from the Friend-\nship Baptist Church to protest racial inequalities in\nTaliaferro County. Another group led by Reverend\nWhitney Ward and a group of his white followers, were\nalso at or near the Courthouse square. They had a\nloudspeaker over which records were played. Both\ngroups conducted their programs simultaneously at\ndifferent places on the square. On the following day,\n4\n\nCounty Attorney Richards met with Solicitor General\nKenneth Goolsby and gave to Mr. Goolsby a copy of a\nletter that Reverend Ward had provided Mr. Richards.\nThe letter concerned the alleged interference of Rever-\nend Ward's meeting at the Courthouse on August 22,\nby the Negro demonstration. Later that day, Sheriff\nMoore arrested Calvin Turner, and the Reverend Joseph\nCooney, a civil rights worker from the District of\nColumbia, for violation of Georgia Code 26-6901,\ndisturbing divine worship.\nThe regular session of the Taliaferro County\nGrand Jury was scheduled to meet on August 23, 1965.\nIt was not convened but met instead on August 30, 1965,\nafter the names of Negroes were added to the jury list.\nThe grand jury indicted nine persons for violating\nGeorgia Code Section 26-6901, disturbing divine worship.\nThe indictments charged that the conduct of the Negro\ndemonstrators at the Courthouse square on August 22,\n1965, disturbed a divine worship, conducted by Reverend\nWard. The Grand Jury also indicted Calvin Turner,\nClara and Dock Davis, and Edna Swain of five counts of\nforgery arising out of the submission of applications\nfor transfer to attend Alexander Stephens Institute on\nbehalf of Negro children, in July 1965. Mr. Calvin\nTurner was confined in jail from about August 31, 1965,\nuntil at least September 10, 1965, for failure to post\n$17,750 bond which was set following his arrest for\nviolating the Georgia divine worship and forgery statutes.\n5\n\nThe 1965-66 school year began on August 30, 1965\nin Taliaferro County, Georgia. No white students appeared\nat Alexander Stephens Institute. Taliaferro County\nprovided public school bus transportation for the\nwhite students to attend classes in Warren, Wilkes,\nand Greene Counties, Georgia. Negro students who had\nrequested transfers to Alexander Stephens Institute\nwere unable to attend because the school was not\noperated. To protest the closing, Negro students, in\nSeptember and October, 1965, attempted to board, and\nplaced themselves in the path of the buses which\ntransported the white Taliaferro County students to\nWarren,. Wilkes, and Greene Counties. Beginning September\n10, and ending on October 12, 1965, a series of four\ndemonstrations occurred at the Murden School, during\none of which a list of grievances was presented to the\nprincipal by representatives of the Negro demonStratorsi\nPlaintiff filed the complaint in the instant\naction on September 10, 1965, alleging that Georgia\nCode 26-6901 concerning disturbance of divine worship,\nis unconstitutional, that Georgia Code 26-3914, the\nGeorgia foregery statute, is unconstitutional, and in\nCount III, that, in general, defendants have conspired\nto deny plaintiffs their civil rights,\nCount III incorporates by reference the allegations\nof Counts I and II, alleges that the acts of defendant\nGoolsby were committed in furtherance of a conspiracy\nin violation of 28 U.S.C. 1985(3), and alleges that the\nTaliaferro County Sheriff, Milton Moore, the County\n6\n\nAttorney, Harold F. Richards; the County Superin-\ntendent of Schools, Mrs. Lola Williams; the members\nof the County Board of Education; and the Solicitor\nGeneral of the Toombs Judicial Circuit, Kenneth E.\nGoolsby, are co-conspirators, who have combined and\nconspired under color of state law to deprive the\nplaintiffs and the member-of their class of the equal\nprotection of the laws or of privileges and immunities\nunder the federal Constitution and statutes. Specifically,\nit is alleged that, among other things, the\nTaliaferro County school officials refused to rehire\nsix teachers who assented to a request on behalf of\nNegro students to use the one gymnasium in the county;\nthat the Taliaferro County school officials arranged\nfor the education of white students, but not Negro stu-\ndents, in the schools of the surrounding counties; that\ncertain defendants caused civil rights workers to be\nchased, to be deprived of guaranteed rights, and\nthreatened; that defendant Richards caused warrants\nto be signed by Negro citizens against Calvin Turner\non the charge of forgery, in 'furtherance of the con-\nspiracy; and that defendant Goolsby by presenting evidence\nto the grand jury caused indictments to be returned\nagainst Calvin Turner and the Reverend Joseph Cooney\nfor violating Georgia Code 26-6901 and by participating\nin the transfer of the 112 white students to schools\nin the adjoining counties acted to further the conspiracy.\nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of\nGeorgia Code Sections 26-6901 and 26-3914; and that\n7\n\nthe defendants, be enjoined from, among other things,\nconspiring to use or in any way using their authority-to\nharass, intimidate, impede or prevent the plaintiffs\nfrom exercising their rights, privileges and immunities\nas citizens of the United States; that certain de-\nfendants be enjoined from interferring by violence,\nthreats, or arrests and threats of arrest or prosecutions\nwith plaintiff's assembling, marching and demonstrating\nat reasonable times; and that defendant Sheriff Moore\nbe enjoined from failing to provide demonstrators with\nadequate police protection and that the defendants Lola\nWilliams and the Taliaferro County Board of Education\nbe enjoined from using public monies to support students\nresiding outside of Taliaferro County unless all stu-\ndents have the privilege of attending these schools.\nCount 'IV was added by amendment on October\n11, 1965, It adds several Negro students and parents\nas plaintiff and adds the superintendents and members\nof the Boards of Education of Warren and Greene Counties\nas defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the newly added\ndefendants agreed and arranged with certain other\ndefendants to enroll the former Alexander Stephens\nInstitute students in their respective school systems.\nPlaintiff seeks to enjoin the Taliaferro County School\nofficials from operating a segregated school system and\nfrom continuing to educate white Taliaferro County\nstudents in schools in the surrounding counties and\nseeks to enjoin the other defendants from accepting\nand educating these students. In the alternative, plaintiff\n\nrequests that the court require the reorganiza-\ntion of the Taliaferro County school system into a\nunitary non-racial system, including the assignment\nof children, staff, and faculty on a non-racial\nbasis.\nThe United States of America, on January 12,\n1966 filed a motion to intervene under the provisions\nof Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\nRult. 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures.\nLimited leave to intervene was granted at the hearing\non February 23, 1966.\n9\n\nARGUMENT\nJOINDER OF CLAIMS\nAND PARTIES IS PROPER\nA. The Requirement That All Claims\nAsserted Against Defendants Must\nArise Out Of One Transaction Or\nSeries of Transactions Is\nSatisfied.\nDefendants have filed several motions in this\naction regarding the propriety of the three-judge court\nto hear and decide issues relating to the desegregation\nof the public schools of the four counties along with\nthe questions of the constitutionality of the two sec-\ntions of the Georgia Code. Attachment A to this brief\ncontains a synopsis of the motions on these issues.\nThs issues raised are whether there is proper\njoinder of the several parties and claims under Rule\n18, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and whether the\nthree-judge court should hear and decide the matters\nraised in the four counts of plaintiff's complaint. In\norder to determine whether, in this instance where there\nare multiple parties to an action and multiple claims, if\neach are properly joined, it is necessary to determine\nif the requirements of Rulesl8 and 20, Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, are satisfied.\n0\n- 1  -\n\nRule 18, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, pro-\nvides that a plaintiff may join, either as independent\nor as alternate claims as many claims as he may have\nagainst an opposing party. Similar joinder of claims\nis permitted when there are multiple parties if the\nrequirements of joinder of parties are met. Rule 20,\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, permits joinder of\ndefendants if there is asserted against them jointly,\nseverally, or in the alternative, any right to relief\narising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or\nseries of transactions or occurrences, and if any\nquestion of law or fact common to all of them will\narise in the action.\nIn order to properly join claims and to\nproperly join parties it must be shown first, that there\nis asserted against the multiple defendants a right to\nrelief in respect of or arising out of the same trans-\naction, occurrence, or series of transactions or\noccurrences. In this proceeding, the common transaction\nor series of transactions are the acts of the several\ndefendants to prevent Negro students from attending de-\nsegregated schools. These acts are alleged in Count III\n1/\nto constitute a conspiracy.(cid:9) There is no requirement\nthat the transaction or series of transactions be limited\nto a particular span of time; the determination of\n1/ Clearly the conspiracy and the acts of each individual\npursuant to it arise out of \"the same transaction,\noccurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.\"\nSee Eastern Fireproofing_ Co., v. United States \nGypsum Co., 160 F.Supp. 580 (D.C. Mass., 1958).\n\nwhether the acts of the defendants are part of the same\ntransaction or series of transactions must be determined\nfrom the facts in each case.\nIn this proceeding, the four counts of the com-\nplaint, as amended, all relate to a same transaction or\nseries of transactions, the acts of the several defen-\ndants to prevent or discourage Negro citizens of\nTaliaferro County from exercising certain constitu-\ntionally guaranteed rights, including the right to attend\ndesegregated schools. Count III of the complaint in-\ncorporates the allegations of Counts I and II and in\nCount IV, it is alleged, in essence, that by maintaining \nsegregated schools, the defendants continued to give \nforce and effect to the events which occurred which pre-\nvented Negro students from attending desegregated schools.\nThe events which show the existence of the\ncommon transaction or series of transactions, as set\nforth in the facts above are:\n1. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nand the members of the\nTaliaferro County Board of\nEducation in the Spring of\n1965 refused to rehire six\nNegro teachers at Murden\nSchool;\n- 12 -\n\n1\n2. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nand the members of the\nTaliaferro County Board of\nEducation during the 1964-\n1965 school year refused\nto permit Negroes to use\nthe Alexander Stephens\nInstitute gymnasium;\n3. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nthe members of the Taliaferro\nCounty Board of Education, and\nMr. Richards, Mr. Goolsby, and\nSheriff Moore, in July 1965,\ninstituted an investigation of\napplications for transfer by\nNegroes to Alexander Stephens\nInstitute, and, investigated\nand initiated the prosecution\nof Calvin Turner for forgery,\nunder Georgia Code 26-3914;\n4. The defendants, Mrs. LTilliams,\nthe superintendents of the\nGreene, Warren, and Wilkes\nCounty Boards of Education\nand the Boards of Education\nof Warren, Wilkes, Greene,\nand Taliaferro Counties\narranged for the transfer\n- 13 -\n\nof white students who attended\nAlexander Stephens Institute in\n1964-1965 to the schools in\nWarren, Wilkes, and Greene\nCounties for the 1965-1966\nschool year;\n5. The defendants, Sheriff Moore,\nMr. Richards, and Mr. Goolsby\nsought indictments for viola-\ntion of the divine worship\nstatute (Georgia Code\n26-6901) of members of the\ncivil rights movement who\nwere promoting, among other\nrights, the desegregation of\nTaliaferro County Public\nSchools;\n6. The defendants, the superin-\ntendents and the members of\nthe Boards of Education of\nthe Warren, Wilkes, Greene,\nand Taliaferro Counties,\nwhile arranging for the\ntransfer of white students\nto the schools in Warren,\nWilkes, and Greene Counties,\nfailed to notify Negro stu-\ndents residing in Taliaferro\n- 14 -\n\nCounty of their right\nand of the opportunity to\nmake such transfers;\n7. All of the defendants have\nperpetuated the racial segre-\ngation of the public school\nsystem of Taliaferro County.\nThus, it is clear that the claims in this case\narise out of common occurrence or series of transactions,\nnamely the efforts of the defendants to avoid the de-\nsegregation of public schools in Taliaferro County.\n\nB. There are questions of law and fact common to \nall parties.\nIn our view, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nRules 18 and 20, authorize the joinder of multiple claims\nand multiple parties when the claims arise \"out of the\nsame transaction or occurrence or series of transactions\nor occurrences\" and there is a question of law common to\n2/\nall defendants.\nIt is clear from the evidence in this proceeding\nthat, apart from the question of a conspiracy, there is\nat least one question of fact in this case which is\ncommon to all defendants. This question is whether\nthe defendants sought to prevent Negro children from\nattending desegregated public schools in Taliaferro\nCounty. This question of fact is common to all of the\nparties.\nBecause the defendants in this proceeding are\nall agents of the State and have all acted with a\ncommon purpose, they must be deemed to have acted in\nconcert.\n2/ Indeed, the proposed revision of the Federal Rules\nmakes this principle explicit. See Amendments to Rules \nof Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts,\nUnited States Supreme Court, February 28, 1966, Rules 18\nand 20. This is also the position taken in 2 Barron and\nHoltzoff, (Wright ed.) 033.1. But see Moore, Federal \nPractice 1810-13 (0_8.04 [3]).\n- 16 -\n\nThis is not a case involving private individuals\nunrelated in fact or law to each other; it is a case in-\nvolving a group of local officials who are agents of the\nState of Georgia carrying out a single purpose in a re-\nlated series of acts. There is a question of law common\nto all defendants -- whether their action in seeking to\nprevent Negroes from attending desegregated public schools\nin Taliaferro County are in violation of the Constitution.\nIt makes no difference that there are some questions of\nlaw, such as the validity of the divine worship statute,\nwhich are not common to all defendants and are not common\nto all plaintiffs. Rule 20 provides that the relief heed\nnot be the same for or against all parties. It states,\n.  plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in\nf t%. \nobtaining or defending against all the relief demanded.\nJudgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs\naccording to their respective rights to relief, and\nagainst one or more of the defendants according to their\nrespective liabilities.\"\nThe prosecution of Negroes engaged in desegrega-\ntion activities and the defendants' dodging of desegre-\ngation by sending white children to other counties are\nrelated acts and a part of an overall policy. If any\none of these defendants was sued for his role in this\nscheme, the evidence of the related acts of all the\nother defendants would be essential to proof of the\nclaim.\n- 17 -\n\nThis is a class action and private plaintiffs\nare all members of class. They assert in Count III\nthat all defendants have acted in concert to deprive\nthem and the members of their class of rights secured\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States.\nThus, this claim involves a question of law common to\nall parties.\n\nTHIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND\nDECIDE ALL ISSUES IN THIS PROCEEDING\nA. This Court Has Jurisdiction To Hear\nAnd Decide The Issues Of The Unconยป.\nstitutionality Of State Statutes\nWhen a complaint seeks an injunction against\nthe enforcement of a state statute on the grounds of\nunconstitutionality the case must be heard and determined\nby a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281\net. seq., LIE. Florida  Lime and Avocate Growers, Inc.\nv. Jacobson, 362 U.S. 73 (1960), Ex Parte Bransford,\nsupra. The Court in its order of October 22, 1965, held\nthat Georgia Code 26-6901, the divine worship statute, is\nunconstitutional as applied, and reserved the ques-\ntion of facial unconstituionality for final hearing.\nIt enjoined prosecution under Georgia Code 26.0914,\nthe forgery statute, and the ultimate determination\nof its constitutionality is pending before the Court.\n\nB. A Three-Judge Court May Consider \nIssues Ancillary and Related to\nA Constitutional Attack on A\nState Statute.\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"[w]here a\ncomplaint seeks to enjoin a state statute on sub-\nstantial grounds of federal unconstitutionality,\nthen even though nonconstitutional grounds of\nattack are also alleged, we think the case is one\nthat is 'required by . . . Act of Congress to be\nheard and determined by a district court of three \njudges.\" (Emphasis by the court). Florida Lime and \nAvocado Growers, Inc., v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 85\n(1960). See also Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965). In\nSterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932,), the court\nstated that the jurisdiction of a properly constituted\nthree-judge court \"extends to every question involved,\nwhether of state or federal law, and enables the court\nto rest its judgment on the decision of such of the\nquestions as in its opinion effectively dispose of the\ncase.\" 287 U.S. at 393. Thus, it is clear that a\nthree-judge court which is properly convened can hear\nand determine issues which do not in themselves justify\n3_/\na three-judge court.\n3/ The I.C.C. three-judge court cases are not in point.\nThey arise under 28 U.S.C.ยง2325, which has been construed\nto prohibit the joinder with a valid three-judge claim\nwith a one-judge claim seeking the same relief. E.g.,\nPittsburgh & W.V.R. Co. v. United States, 281 U.S. 479\n(1930). See also Neu York Securities Co. v. United States,\n287 U.S. 12 (1932) and Powell v. United States, 300 U.S. 276\n(1937). It is clear that three-judge courts convened.\n- 20 -\n\nMoreover, a Section 2281 three-judge court is\nnot limited to considering constitutional and non-\nconstitutional claims which both seek relief from\nenforcement of a statute. In White v. Crook, Civil\nAction No. 2263 (N.D., Ala., 1966) a three-judge court\nconsisting of Judges Rives, Allgood, and Johnson,\nheard and determined a constitutional challenge to\nan Alabama statute limiting jury service to men, joined\nwith a claim that the defendants had systematically\nexcluded Negroes from jury service. The latter claim\ndid not seek an injunction against a state statute's\nenforcement. ,and would not therefore justify a three-\njudge court in its own right.\n3/ (con't.) pursuant to 28 U.S.C.ยง2281 are not subject\nto the limitations of three-judge courts convened pur-\nsuant to 28 U.S.C.2325, since a 28 U.S.C.ยง2281 Court\nmay hear all challenges to a statute, non-constitutional\nas well as ccnstitutional. Florida Lime and Avocado\nGrowers v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73 (1960). However, the\nmost recent case dealing with the jurisdiction of a\nยง2325 Court, held that a three-judge court could consider\nboth a claim seeking review of an I.C.C. rate order (a\nthree-judge claim) and an issue arising under the anti-\ntrust laws. There the non-three-judge claim did not\nseek the same relief as the three-judge claim. The\nCourt held that since the issues in the two claims were\n\"inextricably emmeshed l it could hear them both. Cf.\nalso Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258 (1924).\n- 21 -\n\nThe only case cited by defendants which is\nsimilar in its facts to the case at hand and arises\nunder the same jurisdictional statute is Public\nService Commission of Missouri v. Brashear Freight \nLines, 312 U.S. 621 (1941). There a three-judge court\n* acted upon a claim of unconstitutionality of a state\ntax law and a counter-claim for assessment of money\ndamages. The court did not hold that the three-judge\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to try the case but\nheld that the non-three-judge claim was properly\nappealed to the Court of Appeals on the merits.\nThis indicates that the three-judge court's exercise\nof jurisdiction was permissable. See generally,\nKurland, The Romero Case and  Some Problems of Federal \nJurisdiction, 73 Harv.  L. Rev. 817, 836-41 (1960).\nDefendant's reliance on Hurn v. Oursler, 289\nU.S. 238 (1933) 9 and related cases involving the\ndoctrine of pendant jurisdiction is unfounded. The\npendant jurisdiction rule as outlined in these cases\nis concerned with the issue of a federal court hearing\nand deciding state causes of action. Under the rule\nof those cases a federal court has jurisdiction over a\nstate cause of action only if it is predicated upon the\nsame fact pattern which gave rise to the federal claim\nbefore the court. Thus, a federal court is without\njurisdiction to determine a state cause of action not\npredicated upon a set of facts which also gave rise to\na federal claim. The rationale of this rule is founded\n- 22 -\n\nupon constitutional notions of federalism and the hesitancy\nof the federal courts to invade the domain of state law.\nSee generally, Hart and Wechsler, The Federal  Courts and\nthe Federal System, pp. 794, 797-809. In this proceeding\nthis Court is presented with an entirely different issue.\nA state claim is not alleged and problems of federalism\n4/\nand abstention are not present.\n4/ Even if the analcgy urged by defendants is appropriate,\ndefendants have too strictly construed the distinction\nbetween \"two distinct grounds in support of a single cause\nof action\" and \"two distinct causes of action.\" Applying\nthe rule of Hurn v. Oursler, the 7th Circuit has upheld\nthe joinder of claims alleging 1) patent infringement,\nand 2) breach of a covenant not to infringe the patent.\nEven though the patent was held invalid, the Court said\nthat the second issue should be decided on the merits. It\nheld the patent relevant to the second claim (arising under\nstate law) only to describe the article not to be \"infringed\"\nby the defendant. The \"single cause of action\" requirement\nwas satisfied here by the overlapping of the evidence which\nhad to be presented on each claim. United Lens Corp. v.\nDoray Lamp, Inc., 93 F. 2d 969 (7th Cir. 1937) (alternative\nholding).\n- 23 -\n\nIn the three-judge court situation, the primary\nconsideration is that of judicial economy. It is ap-\nparent that severance as requested by the defendants\nwould place an added burden on the court system.\nCounts I and II would be heard by a three-judge court,\nCounts III and IV by a single judge. Assuming each\ncase ran the gamut of review, the latter would be ap-\npealed to a circuit court. Two separate appeals to\nthe Supreme Court would be necessary. Moreover, as\nhas been discussed previously, much of the proof rele-\nvant to Counts I and II would be repeated in the hearing\non Count III, since I and II are alleged as part of the\nCount III conspiracy. Also, much of the other evidence\nadduced under Count III would be duplicated on the\ntrials of Counts t and II, to show the purpose of the\napplication of the statutes. Clearly the case in its\npresent posture prevents needless duplication and repetition.\nThus, it is apparent that this Court has jurisdiction\nnot only to decide the questions of the constitutionality\nof the state statutes, but has jurisdiction to decide all\nissues in the proceeding.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is our contention that the claims\nand parties were properly joined under the provisions\nof Rules d8 and 20, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThe requirements of joinder have clearly been satisfied.\nIt is also clear that this Court, a Three Judge District\nCourt must, under 18 U.S.C. 2281, hear and decide\nthe questions of the constitutionality of the Georgia\ncriminal statutes, the disturbance of divine worship statute\n(Georgia Code 26-6901) and the Georgia forgery statute\n(26-3914). It is likewise clear that this Court\nshould hear and decide all of the issues and matters\nalleged and presented in this proceeding.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN HEDIAND.,\nCARL GABEL,\nAttorneys,\nDepartment of Justice,\nWashington, D. C. 20530\n\nAPPENDIX A\nMotions concerning the issues ofioinder\nand jurisdiction of the Three\nJudge District Court to hear and\ndecide the issues raised in the \nfour counts of the  Complaints. \n1. October 5, 1965\nDefendants Kenneth B. Goolsby and Milton B.\nMoore moved to require plaintiffs to file an amended\ncomplaint stating in separate counts each of seven\nalleged claims for relief in Count III of the com-\nplaint and for an order severing the claims sought to\nbe asserted against Goolsby and Moore from the claims\nsought to be asserted against other defendants. They\ncontended that defendants Goolsby and Moore have no\nauthority over the operation of schools in Taliaferro\nCounty, that the alleged claims against Goolsby and\nMoore do not arise out of the same transactions as\nclaims against other defendants; that undue expense\nto Goolsby and Moore would occur and that the issues\nwill be confused by joint trial of claims against two\ngroups of defendants.\n2. October 5, 1965\nLola Williams, Superintendent of Schools,\nTaliaferro County, and members of the Board of Education\nTaliaferro County, moved for an order dropping them\nas parties defendant or in the alternative for an order\nsevering claims asserted against them from claims asserted\nagainst defendants Goolsby, Moore and Richards.\n\n3. November 16, 1965\nThe members of Wilkes County Board of Education\nand Wilkes County Superintendent of Schools,. M.-A. Guill\nmoved to dismiss the complaint because:\n1. The complaint fails to state a cause\nof action upon which relief can be\ngranted, and\n2.

Negro students\nattended one school, Murden, which was staffed ex-\nclusively by Negro personnel; white students attended\nanother school, Alexander Stephens Institute, which\nwas staffed exclusively by white personnel. Grades\none through twelve were offered at each school.\nAlexander Stephens Institute had a gymnasium;\nMurden did not. Mrs. Lola Williams is the County\nSuperintendent of Education. Her office is in the\nCounty Courthouse, on the town square.\nDuring the Fall of 1964, a group of Negro\nadults and children requested that the one gymnasium\nbe made available for their use; the School Board denied\nthis request. Again, in May, 1965, a similar request\nwas made and denied.\nThe hiring of teachers for the 1965-66 school\nyear was conducted during the Spring of 1965. Teachers\nwho would be assigned to Alexander Stephens Institute\nsigned their contracts at this time; six of the teachers\nwho had taught at Murden School in the 1964-65 school\nyear were notified that their contracts would not be\nrenewed for the 1965-1966 school year.\n\nOn May 3, 1965, the Taliaferro County Board of\nEducation submitted a plan for desegregation of schools\nto the Office of Education, Department of Health, Educa-\ntion and Welfare. Atโขthe Board of Education meeting\non August 2, 1965, the Board noted in its minutes that\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nnotified it to improve the plan but the Board decided\nto rely on its plan of May 3, 1965.\nGroups of Negro and civil rights workers began\nholding demonstrations in May, 1965,and these demon-\nstrations continued throughout the summer. On Sun-\ndays, the usual practice was for the protestors to\nmeet at the Friendship Baptist Church, march to the\ntown square, where they sang songs and prayed, after\nwhich they marched back to the church. On some occasions\ndemonstrations occurred near the office of Mrs. Williams\nand at her home. Some of the songs which the demon-\nstrators sang mentioned her name.\nDuring July 1965, forms by which Negro children\ncould transfer to Alexander Stephens Institute were\nmade available by the school officials. On July 13,\n14, and 15, the Board received 89 applications for\nthe transfer of Negro students to Alexander Stephens\nInstitute. Beginning on July 15, the last day for\n\nthe submission of transfer formโขtthe School Board\nattorney, Harold Richards, Sheriff Moore and agents\nof the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began an in-\nvestigation of alleged irregularities in the submission\nof the 89 choice forms. Mrs. Williams consulted with\nMr. Richards about this investigation. Also in July,\n1965 Mrs. Williams contacted Mr. Ford Boston, the\nSuperintendent of Greene County Schools, concerning\nthe transfer of students to Greene County. At this\ntime Mr. Boston thought that ,7,radcs 8 through 12 would\nnot be operated at Alexander Stephens Institute the\nfollowing year. On July 22-23, 1965 the Warren County\nBoard of Education received a large number of applica-\ntions from students who previously attended Alexander\nStephens Institute to attend schools in that county\nduring the 1965-1966 school year. On August 5, the\nWarren County Board approved the hiring of four teachers\nwho had taught at Alexander Stephens Institute in 1964-\n1965 and who had, in the Spring of 1965, agreed to\nteach in Taliaferro County the following year. On\nAugust 6, the Warren County Board approved the trans-\nfers of students who previously attended Alexander\nStephens Institute.\nAlso, during July, 1965, County and School Board\nAttorney Harold Richards caused three warrants to be\nissued against Calvin Turner for violation of Georgia\nCode, Section 26-3914. Mr. Turner taught in the Murden\nSchool during the 1964-1965 school year but his contract\nwas not renewed for the 1965-1966 school year. He is\n\none of the teachers who assisted Negro children in\ntheir request to use the Alexander Stephen Institute's\ngymnasium, during the 1964-1965 school year, he is\na leader of the Taliaferro County civil rights move-\nment, and is a parent who requested that his children\nattend Alexander Stephens Institute during the 1965-1966\nschool year. The warrants were issued for alleged\nforgeries concerning the filing of requests for four\nNegro students to attend Alexander Stephens Institute.\nMr. Turner was released on bond pending the meeting of\nthe Taliaferro County Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, on\nor shortly after August 31, 1965, returned three in-\ndictments, of four counts each, charging Calvin Turner\nwith violations of the Georgia forgery statute, in con-\nnection with the school transfer application forms filed\non behalf of Negro students to attend Alexander Stephens\nInstitute. Calvin Turner is also a Notary Public and\nacted as such on the applications filed on behalf\nof Negro children to attend Alexander Stephens Instithte.\nOn Sunday, August 22, 1965, about 125 Negroes\nand a few white civil rights workers marched together\nto the Taliaferro County Courthouse from the Friend-\nship Baptist Church to protest racial inequalities in\nTaliaferro County. Another group led by Reverend\nWhitney Ward and a group of his white followers, were\nalso at or near the Courthouse square. They had a\nloudspeaker over which records were played. Both\ngroups conducted their programs simultaneously at\ndifferent places on the square. On the following day,\n4\n\nCounty Attorney Richards met with Solicitor General\nKenneth Goolsby and gave to Mr. Goolsby a copy of a\nletter that Reverend Ward had provided Mr. Richards.\nThe letter concerned the alleged interference of Rever-\nend Ward's meeting at the Courthouse on August 22,\nby the Negro demonstration. Later that day, Sheriff\nMoore arrested Calvin Turner, and the Reverend Joseph\nCooney, a civil rights worker from the District of\nColumbia, for violation of Georgia Code 26-6901,\ndisturbing divine worship.\nThe regular session of the Taliaferro County\nGrand Jury was scheduled to meet on August 23, 1965.\nIt was not convened but met instead on August 30, 1965,\nafter the names of Negroes were added to the jury list.\nThe grand jury indicted nine persons for violating\nGeorgia Code Section 26-6901, disturbing divine worship.\nThe indictments charged that the conduct of the Negro\ndemonstrators at the Courthouse square on August 22,\n1965, disturbed a divine worship, conducted by Reverend\nWard. The Grand Jury also indicted Calvin Turner,\nClara and Dock Davis, and Edna Swain of five counts of\nforgery arising out of the submission of applications\nfor transfer to attend Alexander Stephens Institute on\nbehalf of Negro children, in July 1965. Mr. Calvin\nTurner was confined in jail from about August 31, 1965,\nuntil at least September 10, 1965, for failure to post\n$17,750 bond which was set following his arrest for\nviolating the Georgia divine worship and forgery statutes.\n5\n\nThe 1965-66 school year began on August 30, 1965\nin Taliaferro County, Georgia. No white students appeared\nat Alexander Stephens Institute. Taliaferro County\nprovided public school bus transportation for the\nwhite students to attend classes in Warren, Wilkes,\nand Greene Counties, Georgia. Negro students who had\nrequested transfers to Alexander Stephens Institute\nwere unable to attend because the school was not\noperated. To protest the closing, Negro students, in\nSeptember and October, 1965, attempted to board, and\nplaced themselves in the path of the buses which\ntransported the white Taliaferro County students to\nWarren,. Wilkes, and Greene Counties. Beginning September\n10, and ending on October 12, 1965, a series of four\ndemonstrations occurred at the Murden School, during\none of which a list of grievances was presented to the\nprincipal by representatives of the Negro demonStratorsi\nPlaintiff filed the complaint in the instant\naction on September 10, 1965, alleging that Georgia\nCode 26-6901 concerning disturbance of divine worship,\nis unconstitutional, that Georgia Code 26-3914, the\nGeorgia foregery statute, is unconstitutional, and in\nCount III, that, in general, defendants have conspired\nto deny plaintiffs their civil rights,\nCount III incorporates by reference the allegations\nof Counts I and II, alleges that the acts of defendant\nGoolsby were committed in furtherance of a conspiracy\nin violation of 28 U.S.C. 1985(3), and alleges that the\nTaliaferro County Sheriff, Milton Moore, the County\n6\n\nAttorney, Harold F. Richards; the County Superin-\ntendent of Schools, Mrs. Lola Williams; the members\nof the County Board of Education; and the Solicitor\nGeneral of the Toombs Judicial Circuit, Kenneth E.\nGoolsby, are co-conspirators, who have combined and\nconspired under color of state law to deprive the\nplaintiffs and the member-of their class of the equal\nprotection of the laws or of privileges and immunities\nunder the federal Constitution and statutes. Specifically,\nit is alleged that, among other things, the\nTaliaferro County school officials refused to rehire\nsix teachers who assented to a request on behalf of\nNegro students to use the one gymnasium in the county;\nthat the Taliaferro County school officials arranged\nfor the education of white students, but not Negro stu-\ndents, in the schools of the surrounding counties; that\ncertain defendants caused civil rights workers to be\nchased, to be deprived of guaranteed rights, and\nthreatened; that defendant Richards caused warrants\nto be signed by Negro citizens against Calvin Turner\non the charge of forgery, in 'furtherance of the con-\nspiracy; and that defendant Goolsby by presenting evidence\nto the grand jury caused indictments to be returned\nagainst Calvin Turner and the Reverend Joseph Cooney\nfor violating Georgia Code 26-6901 and by participating\nin the transfer of the 112 white students to schools\nin the adjoining counties acted to further the conspiracy.\nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of\nGeorgia Code Sections 26-6901 and 26-3914; and that\n7\n\nthe defendants, be enjoined from, among other things,\nconspiring to use or in any way using their authority-to\nharass, intimidate, impede or prevent the plaintiffs\nfrom exercising their rights, privileges and immunities\nas citizens of the United States; that certain de-\nfendants be enjoined from interferring by violence,\nthreats, or arrests and threats of arrest or prosecutions\nwith plaintiff's assembling, marching and demonstrating\nat reasonable times; and that defendant Sheriff Moore\nbe enjoined from failing to provide demonstrators with\nadequate police protection and that the defendants Lola\nWilliams and the Taliaferro County Board of Education\nbe enjoined from using public monies to support students\nresiding outside of Taliaferro County unless all stu-\ndents have the privilege of attending these schools.\nCount 'IV was added by amendment on October\n11, 1965, It adds several Negro students and parents\nas plaintiff and adds the superintendents and members\nof the Boards of Education of Warren and Greene Counties\nas defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the newly added\ndefendants agreed and arranged with certain other\ndefendants to enroll the former Alexander Stephens\nInstitute students in their respective school systems.\nPlaintiff seeks to enjoin the Taliaferro County School\nofficials from operating a segregated school system and\nfrom continuing to educate white Taliaferro County\nstudents in schools in the surrounding counties and\nseeks to enjoin the other defendants from accepting\nand educating these students. In the alternative, plaintiff\n\nrequests that the court require the reorganiza-\ntion of the Taliaferro County school system into a\nunitary non-racial system, including the assignment\nof children, staff, and faculty on a non-racial\nbasis.\nThe United States of America, on January 12,\n1966 filed a motion to intervene under the provisions\nof Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\nRult. 24 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures.\nLimited leave to intervene was granted at the hearing\non February 23, 1966.\n9\n\nARGUMENT\nJOINDER OF CLAIMS\nAND PARTIES IS PROPER\nA. The Requirement That All Claims\nAsserted Against Defendants Must\nArise Out Of One Transaction Or\nSeries of Transactions Is\nSatisfied.\nDefendants have filed several motions in this\naction regarding the propriety of the three-judge court\nto hear and decide issues relating to the desegregation\nof the public schools of the four counties along with\nthe questions of the constitutionality of the two sec-\ntions of the Georgia Code. Attachment A to this brief\ncontains a synopsis of the motions on these issues.\nThs issues raised are whether there is proper\njoinder of the several parties and claims under Rule\n18, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and whether the\nthree-judge court should hear and decide the matters\nraised in the four counts of plaintiff's complaint. In\norder to determine whether, in this instance where there\nare multiple parties to an action and multiple claims, if\neach are properly joined, it is necessary to determine\nif the requirements of Rulesl8 and 20, Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, are satisfied.\n0\n- 1  -\n\nRule 18, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, pro-\nvides that a plaintiff may join, either as independent\nor as alternate claims as many claims as he may have\nagainst an opposing party. Similar joinder of claims\nis permitted when there are multiple parties if the\nrequirements of joinder of parties are met. Rule 20,\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, permits joinder of\ndefendants if there is asserted against them jointly,\nseverally, or in the alternative, any right to relief\narising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or\nseries of transactions or occurrences, and if any\nquestion of law or fact common to all of them will\narise in the action.\nIn order to properly join claims and to\nproperly join parties it must be shown first, that there\nis asserted against the multiple defendants a right to\nrelief in respect of or arising out of the same trans-\naction, occurrence, or series of transactions or\noccurrences. In this proceeding, the common transaction\nor series of transactions are the acts of the several\ndefendants to prevent Negro students from attending de-\nsegregated schools. These acts are alleged in Count III\n1/\nto constitute a conspiracy.(cid:9) There is no requirement\nthat the transaction or series of transactions be limited\nto a particular span of time; the determination of\n1/ Clearly the conspiracy and the acts of each individual\npursuant to it arise out of \"the same transaction,\noccurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.\"\nSee Eastern Fireproofing_ Co., v. United States \nGypsum Co., 160 F.Supp. 580 (D.C. Mass., 1958).\n\nwhether the acts of the defendants are part of the same\ntransaction or series of transactions must be determined\nfrom the facts in each case.\nIn this proceeding, the four counts of the com-\nplaint, as amended, all relate to a same transaction or\nseries of transactions, the acts of the several defen-\ndants to prevent or discourage Negro citizens of\nTaliaferro County from exercising certain constitu-\ntionally guaranteed rights, including the right to attend\ndesegregated schools. Count III of the complaint in-\ncorporates the allegations of Counts I and II and in\nCount IV, it is alleged, in essence, that by maintaining \nsegregated schools, the defendants continued to give \nforce and effect to the events which occurred which pre-\nvented Negro students from attending desegregated schools.\nThe events which show the existence of the\ncommon transaction or series of transactions, as set\nforth in the facts above are:\n1. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nand the members of the\nTaliaferro County Board of\nEducation in the Spring of\n1965 refused to rehire six\nNegro teachers at Murden\nSchool;\n- 12 -\n\n1\n2. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nand the members of the\nTaliaferro County Board of\nEducation during the 1964-\n1965 school year refused\nto permit Negroes to use\nthe Alexander Stephens\nInstitute gymnasium;\n3. The defendants, Mrs. Williams,\nthe members of the Taliaferro\nCounty Board of Education, and\nMr. Richards, Mr. Goolsby, and\nSheriff Moore, in July 1965,\ninstituted an investigation of\napplications for transfer by\nNegroes to Alexander Stephens\nInstitute, and, investigated\nand initiated the prosecution\nof Calvin Turner for forgery,\nunder Georgia Code 26-3914;\n4. The defendants, Mrs. LTilliams,\nthe superintendents of the\nGreene, Warren, and Wilkes\nCounty Boards of Education\nand the Boards of Education\nof Warren, Wilkes, Greene,\nand Taliaferro Counties\narranged for the transfer\n- 13 -\n\nof white students who attended\nAlexander Stephens Institute in\n1964-1965 to the schools in\nWarren, Wilkes, and Greene\nCounties for the 1965-1966\nschool year;\n5. The defendants, Sheriff Moore,\nMr. Richards, and Mr. Goolsby\nsought indictments for viola-\ntion of the divine worship\nstatute (Georgia Code\n26-6901) of members of the\ncivil rights movement who\nwere promoting, among other\nrights, the desegregation of\nTaliaferro County Public\nSchools;\n6. The defendants, the superin-\ntendents and the members of\nthe Boards of Education of\nthe Warren, Wilkes, Greene,\nand Taliaferro Counties,\nwhile arranging for the\ntransfer of white students\nto the schools in Warren,\nWilkes, and Greene Counties,\nfailed to notify Negro stu-\ndents residing in Taliaferro\n- 14 -\n\nCounty of their right\nand of the opportunity to\nmake such transfers;\n7. All of the defendants have\nperpetuated the racial segre-\ngation of the public school\nsystem of Taliaferro County.\nThus, it is clear that the claims in this case\narise out of common occurrence or series of transactions,\nnamely the efforts of the defendants to avoid the de-\nsegregation of public schools in Taliaferro County.\n\nB. There are questions of law and fact common to \nall parties.\nIn our view, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nRules 18 and 20, authorize the joinder of multiple claims\nand multiple parties when the claims arise \"out of the\nsame transaction or occurrence or series of transactions\nor occurrences\" and there is a question of law common to\n2/\nall defendants.\nIt is clear from the evidence in this proceeding\nthat, apart from the question of a conspiracy, there is\nat least one question of fact in this case which is\ncommon to all defendants. This question is whether\nthe defendants sought to prevent Negro children from\nattending desegregated public schools in Taliaferro\nCounty. This question of fact is common to all of the\nparties.\nBecause the defendants in this proceeding are\nall agents of the State and have all acted with a\ncommon purpose, they must be deemed to have acted in\nconcert.\n2/ Indeed, the proposed revision of the Federal Rules\nmakes this principle explicit. See Amendments to Rules \nof Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts,\nUnited States Supreme Court, February 28, 1966, Rules 18\nand 20. This is also the position taken in 2 Barron and\nHoltzoff, (Wright ed.) 033.1. But see Moore, Federal \nPractice 1810-13 (0_8.04 [3]).\n- 16 -\n\nThis is not a case involving private individuals\nunrelated in fact or law to each other; it is a case in-\nvolving a group of local officials who are agents of the\nState of Georgia carrying out a single purpose in a re-\nlated series of acts. There is a question of law common\nto all defendants -- whether their action in seeking to\nprevent Negroes from attending desegregated public schools\nin Taliaferro County are in violation of the Constitution.\nIt makes no difference that there are some questions of\nlaw, such as the validity of the divine worship statute,\nwhich are not common to all defendants and are not common\nto all plaintiffs. Rule 20 provides that the relief heed\nnot be the same for or against all parties. It states,\n.  plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in\nf t%. \nobtaining or defending against all the relief demanded.\nJudgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs\naccording to their respective rights to relief, and\nagainst one or more of the defendants according to their\nrespective liabilities.\"\nThe prosecution of Negroes engaged in desegrega-\ntion activities and the defendants' dodging of desegre-\ngation by sending white children to other counties are\nrelated acts and a part of an overall policy. If any\none of these defendants was sued for his role in this\nscheme, the evidence of the related acts of all the\nother defendants would be essential to proof of the\nclaim.\n- 17 -\n\nThis is a class action and private plaintiffs\nare all members of class. They assert in Count III\nthat all defendants have acted in concert to deprive\nthem and the members of their class of rights secured\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States.\nThus, this claim involves a question of law common to\nall parties.\n\nTHIS COURT HAS JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND\nDECIDE ALL ISSUES IN THIS PROCEEDING\nA. This Court Has Jurisdiction To Hear\nAnd Decide The Issues Of The Unconยป.\nstitutionality Of State Statutes\nWhen a complaint seeks an injunction against\nthe enforcement of a state statute on the grounds of\nunconstitutionality the case must be heard and determined\nby a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281\net. seq., LIE. Florida  Lime and Avocate Growers, Inc.\nv. Jacobson, 362 U.S. 73 (1960), Ex Parte Bransford,\nsupra. The Court in its order of October 22, 1965, held\nthat Georgia Code 26-6901, the divine worship statute, is\nunconstitutional as applied, and reserved the ques-\ntion of facial unconstituionality for final hearing.\nIt enjoined prosecution under Georgia Code 26.0914,\nthe forgery statute, and the ultimate determination\nof its constitutionality is pending before the Court.\n\nB. A Three-Judge Court May Consider \nIssues Ancillary and Related to\nA Constitutional Attack on A\nState Statute.\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"[w]here a\ncomplaint seeks to enjoin a state statute on sub-\nstantial grounds of federal unconstitutionality,\nthen even though nonconstitutional grounds of\nattack are also alleged, we think the case is one\nthat is 'required by . . . Act of Congress to be\nheard and determined by a district court of three \njudges.\" (Emphasis by the court). Florida Lime and \nAvocado Growers, Inc., v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 85\n(1960). See also Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965). In\nSterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932,), the court\nstated that the jurisdiction of a properly constituted\nthree-judge court \"extends to every question involved,\nwhether of state or federal law, and enables the court\nto rest its judgment on the decision of such of the\nquestions as in its opinion effectively dispose of the\ncase.\" 287 U.S. at 393. Thus, it is clear that a\nthree-judge court which is properly convened can hear\nand determine issues which do not in themselves justify\n3_/\na three-judge court.\n3/ The I.C.C. three-judge court cases are not in point.\nThey arise under 28 U.S.C.ยง2325, which has been construed\nto prohibit the joinder with a valid three-judge claim\nwith a one-judge claim seeking the same relief. E.g.,\nPittsburgh & W.V.R. Co. v. United States, 281 U.S. 479\n(1930). See also Neu York Securities Co. v. United States,\n287 U.S. 12 (1932) and Powell v. United States, 300 U.S. 276\n(1937). It is clear that three-judge courts convened.\n- 20 -\n\nMoreover, a Section 2281 three-judge court is\nnot limited to considering constitutional and non-\nconstitutional claims which both seek relief from\nenforcement of a statute. In White v. Crook, Civil\nAction No. 2263 (N.D., Ala., 1966) a three-judge court\nconsisting of Judges Rives, Allgood, and Johnson,\nheard and determined a constitutional challenge to\nan Alabama statute limiting jury service to men, joined\nwith a claim that the defendants had systematically\nexcluded Negroes from jury service. The latter claim\ndid not seek an injunction against a state statute's\nenforcement. ,and would not therefore justify a three-\njudge court in its own right.\n3/ (con't.) pursuant to 28 U.S.C.ยง2281 are not subject\nto the limitations of three-judge courts convened pur-\nsuant to 28 U.S.C.2325, since a 28 U.S.C.ยง2281 Court\nmay hear all challenges to a statute, non-constitutional\nas well as ccnstitutional. Florida Lime and Avocado\nGrowers v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73 (1960). However, the\nmost recent case dealing with the jurisdiction of a\nยง2325 Court, held that a three-judge court could consider\nboth a claim seeking review of an I.C.C. rate order (a\nthree-judge claim) and an issue arising under the anti-\ntrust laws. There the non-three-judge claim did not\nseek the same relief as the three-judge claim. The\nCourt held that since the issues in the two claims were\n\"inextricably emmeshed l it could hear them both. Cf.\nalso Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258 (1924).\n- 21 -\n\nThe only case cited by defendants which is\nsimilar in its facts to the case at hand and arises\nunder the same jurisdictional statute is Public\nService Commission of Missouri v. Brashear Freight \nLines, 312 U.S. 621 (1941). There a three-judge court\n* acted upon a claim of unconstitutionality of a state\ntax law and a counter-claim for assessment of money\ndamages. The court did not hold that the three-judge\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to try the case but\nheld that the non-three-judge claim was properly\nappealed to the Court of Appeals on the merits.\nThis indicates that the three-judge court's exercise\nof jurisdiction was permissable. See generally,\nKurland, The Romero Case and  Some Problems of Federal \nJurisdiction, 73 Harv.  L. Rev. 817, 836-41 (1960).\nDefendant's reliance on Hurn v. Oursler, 289\nU.S. 238 (1933) 9 and related cases involving the\ndoctrine of pendant jurisdiction is unfounded. The\npendant jurisdiction rule as outlined in these cases\nis concerned with the issue of a federal court hearing\nand deciding state causes of action. Under the rule\nof those cases a federal court has jurisdiction over a\nstate cause of action only if it is predicated upon the\nsame fact pattern which gave rise to the federal claim\nbefore the court. Thus, a federal court is without\njurisdiction to determine a state cause of action not\npredicated upon a set of facts which also gave rise to\na federal claim. The rationale of this rule is founded\n- 22 -\n\nupon constitutional notions of federalism and the hesitancy\nof the federal courts to invade the domain of state law.\nSee generally, Hart and Wechsler, The Federal  Courts and\nthe Federal System, pp. 794, 797-809. In this proceeding\nthis Court is presented with an entirely different issue.\nA state claim is not alleged and problems of federalism\n4/\nand abstention are not present.\n4/ Even if the analcgy urged by defendants is appropriate,\ndefendants have too strictly construed the distinction\nbetween \"two distinct grounds in support of a single cause\nof action\" and \"two distinct causes of action.\" Applying\nthe rule of Hurn v. Oursler, the 7th Circuit has upheld\nthe joinder of claims alleging 1) patent infringement,\nand 2) breach of a covenant not to infringe the patent.\nEven though the patent was held invalid, the Court said\nthat the second issue should be decided on the merits. It\nheld the patent relevant to the second claim (arising under\nstate law) only to describe the article not to be \"infringed\"\nby the defendant. The \"single cause of action\" requirement\nwas satisfied here by the overlapping of the evidence which\nhad to be presented on each claim. United Lens Corp. v.\nDoray Lamp, Inc., 93 F. 2d 969 (7th Cir. 1937) (alternative\nholding).\n- 23 -\n\nIn the three-judge court situation, the primary\nconsideration is that of judicial economy. It is ap-\nparent that severance as requested by the defendants\nwould place an added burden on the court system.\nCounts I and II would be heard by a three-judge court,\nCounts III and IV by a single judge. Assuming each\ncase ran the gamut of review, the latter would be ap-\npealed to a circuit court. Two separate appeals to\nthe Supreme Court would be necessary. Moreover, as\nhas been discussed previously, much of the proof rele-\nvant to Counts I and II would be repeated in the hearing\non Count III, since I and II are alleged as part of the\nCount III conspiracy. Also, much of the other evidence\nadduced under Count III would be duplicated on the\ntrials of Counts t and II, to show the purpose of the\napplication of the statutes. Clearly the case in its\npresent posture prevents needless duplication and repetition.\nThus, it is apparent that this Court has jurisdiction\nnot only to decide the questions of the constitutionality\nof the state statutes, but has jurisdiction to decide all\nissues in the proceeding.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is our contention that the claims\nand parties were properly joined under the provisions\nof Rules d8 and 20, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThe requirements of joinder have clearly been satisfied.\nIt is also clear that this Court, a Three Judge District\nCourt must, under 18 U.S.C. 2281, hear and decide\nthe questions of the constitutionality of the Georgia\ncriminal statutes, the disturbance of divine worship statute\n(Georgia Code 26-6901) and the Georgia forgery statute\n(26-3914). It is likewise clear that this Court\nshould hear and decide all of the issues and matters\nalleged and presented in this proceeding.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN HEDIAND.,\nCARL GABEL,\nAttorneys,\nDepartment of Justice,\nWashington, D. C. 20530\n\nAPPENDIX A\nMotions concerning the issues ofioinder\nand jurisdiction of the Three\nJudge District Court to hear and\ndecide the issues raised in the \nfour counts of the  Complaints. \n1. October 5, 1965\nDefendants Kenneth B. Goolsby and Milton B.\nMoore moved to require plaintiffs to file an amended\ncomplaint stating in separate counts each of seven\nalleged claims for relief in Count III of the com-\nplaint and for an order severing the claims sought to\nbe asserted against Goolsby and Moore from the claims\nsought to be asserted against other defendants. They\ncontended that defendants Goolsby and Moore have no\nauthority over the operation of schools in Taliaferro\nCounty, that the alleged claims against Goolsby and\nMoore do not arise out of the same transactions as\nclaims against other defendants; that undue expense\nto Goolsby and Moore would occur and that the issues\nwill be confused by joint trial of claims against two\ngroups of defendants.\n2. October 5, 1965\nLola Williams, Superintendent of Schools,\nTaliaferro County, and members of the Board of Education\nTaliaferro County, moved for an order dropping them\nas parties defendant or in the alternative for an order\nsevering claims asserted against them from claims asserted\nagainst defendants Goolsby, Moore and Richards.\n\n3. November 16, 1965\nThe members of Wilkes County Board of Education\nand Wilkes County Superintendent of Schools,. M.-A. Guill\nmoved to dismiss the complaint because:\n1.

To dismiss and strike Counts I and II\nof the complaint in that said counts\nrelate wholly to matters concerning\nTaliaferro County,\n2. To dismiss Count III in that Count III\ncontains a multiplicity of actions,\n3. To dismiss Counts III and IV of complaint\nin that defendant had no opportunity to\ndefend and had no notice of trial of the\ncase, and\n4. To dismiss and vacate the order of the\nCourt dated October 19, 1965 as to them,\nin that said order was granted ex parte \nwhen they had no notice advising that they\nwere parties.\nii\n\n4. February 15, 1966\nThe members of the Wilkes County Board of Education\nand its Superintendent moved to:\n1. Sever claims and parties set forth in\nCounts I and II of plaintiff's complaint\nfrom claims and parties set forth in\nCounts III and IV and that CountsI and II\nbe proceeded with separately from\nCounts III and IV, and\n2. That Counts I and II be heard by a\ndistrict court consisting of three judges\nand Counts III and IV by a district\ncourt consisting of a single judge for\nthe reason that a three-judge court\ndoes not have jurisdiction over Counts\nIII and IV which are the only counts\ninvolving Wilkes County defendants.\n5. February 15, 1966\nA Motion by Wilkes County defendants to strike\nportions of numerous paragraphs in the complaint as\nbeing irrelevant and immaterial.\n6. February 23, 1966\nMotion by Warren County defendants to:\n1. Sever Counts I and II from Counts III and\nIV and that Counts I and II be dealt Tyith\nseparately from Counts III and.IV.\n2. Sever parties between the parties'\nplaintiff and defendants of Counts\nI and II with parties plaintiff and\niii\n\ndefendant in Counts III and IV\nso that claims in CountsI and II\nwill be handled separately from\nthose of Counts III add.
