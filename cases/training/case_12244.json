    "summary": "<p>The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (JRC), formerly known as the Behavioral Research Institute, is a Massachusetts-based residential care facility for children and young adults with severe autism, mental impairments, and mental illnesses associated with behavioral problems. JRC is known for its use of aversive treatments, especially electric shock therapies, to disincentivize undesirable behaviors. As a result of its use of aversive treatments, JRC has been controversial and the subject of several lawsuits spanning decades. This case, along with <a href=\"../../../../case/14077/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Behavioral Research Institute v. Secretary of Administration,</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"../../../../case/14079/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Petition of Kaufman</a>, and <a href=\"../../../../case/18164/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Judge Rotenburg Center v. Food and Drug Administration</a> (see related cases), are some of the cases brought surrounding various issues related to JRC's use of aversive therapies and funding.</p>\r\n<p>In 1985, the Massachusetts Office for Children (OFC), which oversaw facilities like the Behavioral Research Institute (hereinafter referred to as the Judge Rotenberg Center), alleged that the facility's use of \"aversive therapies\" like spankings, muscle squeezes, pinching, and \"restrained timeouts\" violated state regulations. The OFC demanded that the facility show cause why it should not be shut down or otherwise sanctioned.</p>\r\n<p>The Center responded by filing a class action in state court on behalf of itself, its students, and its students' parents. It claimed that the OFC had engaged in bad-faith regulatory actions that violated the students' due process rights as well as the state's Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\r\n<p>In June 1986, the state superior court (Judge Ernest Rotenberg) granted a preliminary injunction barring the OFC from revoking the Center's license to provide services. The court held that prohibiting the Center from practicing \"aversive therapies\" would seriously inhibit its program and harm the students. The preliminary injunction was upheld on appeal.</p>\r\n<p>A few months later, the two parties entered into a settlement agreement, which Judge Rotenberg approved in January 1987. The agreement allowed for \"aversive procedures\" at the Center only when authorized \"as part of a court-ordered 'substituted judgment' treatment plan for an individual client.\" A court-appointed monitor oversaw all court-approved individualized aversive plans and reported regularly to the court. The monitor also had authority to arbitrate any disputes arising under the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement was only supposed to last for one year, but in July 1988, Judge Rotenberg extended it \"until . . . further order.\"</p>\r\n<p>In 1993, the Center brought a contempt action against the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation (which had replaced the OFC in supervising the Center) for alleged violation of the settlement agreement. The Center claimed that the Department acted in bad faith by refusing to grant the Center's request for recertification to use certain \"aversive procedures.\" The Center also claimed that the Department had refused to arbitrate disputes as required by the decree and attempted to disrupt the Center's relationships with funding agencies and clients.</p>\r\n<p>After a bench trial in 1995, the Court (Judge Elizabeth LaStaiti) found the Department of Mental Retardation in contempt, and appointed a receiver to manage the agency in all its dealings with the JRC. The receivership was in place from 1996 until 2006. During that time, the Department of Mental Retardation cooperated with the receiver in issuing licenses and certifications to the JRC. The Department also met with the receiver and Center to resolve any disputes.</p>\r\n<p>In 2003, the receiver recommended returning regulatory authority over the Center to the state Office of Child Care Services, a sub-agency of the Department of Disability Services (DDS), which had succeeded the Department of Mental Retardation. In 2006, the receivership officially ended.</p>\r\n<p>By 2006, the most common type of aversive intervention used by the Center was a graduate electronic decelerator, a device that administered an electric shock to the student's skin. The DDS classified this device as a Level III intervention.</p>\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140508080241/http://www.arcmass.org/Portals/0/NYJRCReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> compiled by the New York State Education Department in 2006, the review team verbalized serious safety concerns about how the facility was supervised and operated. For example, the team found that JRC used Level III interventions on students for behaviors that &ldquo;are not aggressive, health dangerous or destructive, such as nagging, swearing and failing to maintain a neat appearance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, the DDS banned all Level III interventions at facilities it oversaw. The agency allowed some exceptions for people who had existing court-approved treatment plans which included the use of such interventions.</p>\r\n<p>But in 2012 the JRC received widespread media attention for engaging in such Level III interventions when New York magazine published an <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/features/andre-mccollins-rotenberg-center-2012-9/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> featuring a former patient. Additionally, footage of that patient became available to the public as part of a <a href=\"https://boston.cbslocal.com/2012/04/11/mother-sues-judge-rotenberg-center-over-torture-of-disabled-son/.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> filed against the center by the patient&rsquo;s mother.</p>\r\n<p>The same year that the video surfaced, the Massachusetts government submitted a motion asking the court to vacate the 1987 consent decree. The DDS argued that the purpose of the decree had already been fulfilled and additionally introducing clinical and empirical evidence that was not available when the decree was entered. DDS argued that unlike its predecessor, the department has worked with the JRC to license and regulate its programs with transparency. However, in light of new evidence pertaining to the negative effects of using electrical stimulation devices, DDS argued that the consent decree impeded the department&rsquo;s ability to regulate according to widely accepted standards of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>The JRC responded to Massachusetts&rsquo;s argument by asking the court to allow for discovery before making a decision. The JRC argued that a ruling on the government&rsquo;s motion to vacate the consent decree would require the consideration of evidence to decide whether the purposes of the consent decree were fulfilled. While the government argued that the only purpose of the decree was to ensure transparent communication between the organizations, the JRC argued that the consent decree also had a second purpose: to protect the plaintiff&rsquo;s right to effective education and treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Although no further information regarding discovery is available, it is presumed that discovery ensued after these 2013 filings.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, and outside of the court room, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a stance against the use of electrical stimulation devices as treatment in 2016 when it proposed a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/25/2016-09433/banned-devices-proposal-to-ban-electrical-stimulation-devices-used-to-treat-self-injurious-or\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ban</a> on the practice. At the time of the proposal, the JRC was the only facility still using such devices in the United States. In 2016, the FDA estimated that between 45 and 50 individuals were being exposed to the device at the JRC.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, a Bristol county probate and family court judge, Judge Katherine Fields, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/12/judge-rotenberg-educational-center-electric-shocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruled</a> that the government failed to demonstrate that the technique used by the JRC &ldquo;does not conform to the accepted standard of care for treating individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.&rdquo; The Massachusetts Attorney General&rsquo;s Office decided to <a href=\"https://www.patriotledger.com/news/20180724/state-to-appeal-decision-to-allow-shock-therapy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appeal</a> Judge Fields&rsquo;s decision to continue to allow the JRC to operate using electric shock devices.</p>\r\n<p>Although information about that appeal is not available, the FDA has since acted on their 2016 proposal and banned the use of such techniques for responding to &ldquo;aggressive behavior.&rdquo; The FDA issued a <a href=\"federalregister.gov/d/2020-04328\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruling</a> in early 2020 regarding electrical shock devices. While JRC issued a <a href=\"https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/03/04/fda-bans-shock-device-used-for-aggressive-behavior-on-mentally-disabled-patients-at-massachusetts-school\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> saying that the center will continue to fight the FDA decision, full compliance is required by 180 days after publication of the ruling on March 6, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the FDA's ban went into effect, JRC and group of parents of patients filed a petition for review of the FDA's rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. That case is fully described in <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=18164&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Judge Rotenburg Center v. Food and Drug Administration</a>. In July 2021, the D.C. Circuit found that the FDA's rule exceeded its statutory authorities and vacated the ban.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 1986, a residential school that treated students with severe autism, mental illness, and mental disabilities filed a lawsuit on behalf of itself and its students in the Bristol County, Massachusetts Probate and Family against the State of Massachusetts' Office for Children (later Department of Mental Retardation) alleging that it engaged in bad faith regulatory practices to try to decertify the school for the schools use of aversive therapies such as electric shocks and corporal punishment as disincentives. On January 7, 1987, the court approved a settlement agreement that required Massachusetts to agree to the use of aversive therapies so long as those therapies were approved by a court in a substituted judgment hearing. In February 2013, DDS moved to vacate the consent decree, which would allow it to regulate the Center in the same way it regulates every other similar facility, however the court ruled in favor of the school and decided not to vacate the consent decree. In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of electric stimulation devices as treatment, however the FDA's rule was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in July 2021. As of April 2022, it does not appear that JRC is facing any current legal challenges to its use of electrical shock devices.",

      "text": "print this page\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n \n          1. This matter was heard by the Court on a Complaint for Contempt Pursuant to Rule 65.3 of the\nMassachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, brought by The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center,\nInc. (JRC) and parents and guardians of students at Judge Rotenberg Center against Philip Campbell, in his\ncapacity as Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation (DMR).[1]\n-\nFootnote [1] Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) was formerly known as the Behavior Research Institute (BRI).\nJudge Rotenberg, who presided over this litigation, died July 1992. This Judge was designated to succeed him\nby order dated August 1992.\n-\n \n          2. Trial in this case began on Monday, June 26, 1995, and continued through July 14, 1995, for a total\n \nof thirteen trial days. Four hundred and eight exhibits[2]were introduced and seventeen witnesses testified.\n-\nFootnote [2] This litigation was somewhat unusual due to the fact that the actions of all parties are fully\ndocumented in these exhibits. Exhibits referred to herein are as follows: Entered by Agreement 1-235, offered\nby JRC and entered by the Court 236-326.\n-\n \n          3. This matter came before the court as a Contempt Complaint brought by JRC against DMR to\nenforce the terms of a Settlement Agreement that “resolved” extensive and difficult litigation. The Settlement\nAgreement was entered as an Order of the Court on January 7, 1987. DMR voluntarily entered into the\nSettlement Agreement on December 29, 1988. For this reason, the critical issue in this litigation is not that of\nthe authority of the Administrative Agency versus the authority of the Judiciary.\n \n          4. Further, this litigation is not concerned with the use of aversive therapy. The many issues surrounding\nthe use of aversive therapy, both in the abstract and in the particular, are addressed through Substituted\nJudgment Proceedings in Individual Guardianship cases.\n \n\n \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n \n          5. On December 12, 1986, JRC, the parents of students at JRC, and the students through their legal\nrepresentatives, entered  into the Settlement  Agreement with  Mary Kay  Leonard, individually,  and in  her\ncapacity as Director of the Massachusetts Office for Children (“OFC”). The Settlement Agreement ended\nlitigation between the Commonwealth and JRC which began on September 26, 1985, when OFC issued an\norder to show cause why JRC’s license to operate should not be suspended. On June 4, 1986, this Court\nentered a preliminary injunction against the Director of OFC finding that she had engaged in bad faith in her\nregulatory activities concerning JRC.[3]\n-\nFootnote [3] This Court’s order, as well as its Findings in Support of Preliminary Injunctive Relief dated June\n4, 1986, were affirmed in a decision by the Single Justice of the Appeals Court (Greaney, J.) dated July 30,\n1986 (Docket No. 86-0318).\n-\n On October 31, 1986, this Court awarded JRC, and the parents, the sum of $580,605.25 which represented\nthe legal fees incurred as a result OFC’s bad faith actions. Shortly thereafter, the parties engaged in settlement\ndiscussions which culminated in the execution of the Settlement Agreement.\n \n          6. On January 7, 1987, the Court found the Settlement Agreement to be fair, reasonable and adequate,\nand incorporated the Settlement Agreement as an Order of this Court. (Exhibit 4). In accordance with the\nterms of the agreement, John Daignault, Ph.D., was appointed Court Monitor.[4]\n-\nFootnote [4] Indeed, the  parties had agreed in the Settlement Agreement that Dr. Daignault would be the\ngeneral monitor of BRI’s treatment program, and that Dr. Daignault “shall undertake general monitoring of\nBRI’s  treatment  and  educational  program.”  (Exhibit  2,  p.7).  The  parties  also  agreed  in  the  Settlement\nAgreement that Dr. Daignault “shall be responsible for overseeing BRI’s compliance with all applicable state\nregulation, except to the extent that those regulations involve treatment  procedures authorized by the Court in\naccordance with Paragraph A.”\n-\n \n          7. On February 12, 1987, this Court issued a memorandum to all partied in this case, restating material\nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement concerning the Court Monitor.[5]\n\n-\nFootnote [5]  This memorandum  stated that  in order  to insure  full consideration  to  the guardianship  and\nsubstituted judgment issues for each appropriate JRC student, while at the same time maintaining an orderly\nprocess  based  on clinical  need  in  addressing the  large  JRC  population, the  Court  is  requesting  that  all\ninterested parties initially channel information through the Court Monitor. The Monitor will assist the Court in\nscheduling matters to be heard before the Court according to the primary criterion of urgency and clinical need.\nIn addition, the Monitor will keep the Court appraised of all developments in his regular reports to the Court.\nLastly, all parties are reminded of the Monitor’s role as outlined in the Settlement Agreement insofar as all\nconflicts or disputes shall be brought initially to the Monitor for attempted resolution. (Emphasis supplied).\n-\n \n          8. On July 7, 1988, the Court Monitor filed a report with this Court in compliance with the six-month\nreview required by the Settlement Agreement. (Exhibit 9). It stated that the parties were complying with the\nSettlement Agreement, but that JRC had yet to be licensed by the Department of Mental Retardation (which\nhad assumed the responsibilities under the Settlement Agreement from the Department of Mental Health,\n“DMH”).[6]\n-\nFootnote [6] At the time of the 1985 litigation OFC was responsible for licensing JRC. That responsibility was\ntransferred by the legislature to DMH in July 1, 1987. Finally, said function was transferred to DMR on\nDecember 29, 1988.\n-\n \n          9. In response thereto, this Court issued an order July 7, 1988, extending jurisdiction over the\nSettlement  Agreement  “until  further  order  of  this  Court.”  The  Court’s  order  noted  that  there  were  no\nobjections to the extension of jurisdiction.\n \n          10. On October 24, 1988, the Department of Mental Retardation filed a motion with this Court to\nmodify the Settlement Agreement by deleting the Department of Mental Health whenever appearing in the\nSettlement Agreement, and inserting the Department of Mental Retardation.\n \n          11. On December 29, 1988, the Court accepted the motion filed by the Department of Mental\nRetardation as an intervention in the action under Rule 24 (b)(2) and the Court welcomed DMR as a “party\nunder the Settlement Agreement.” (Exhibit 13) No party appealed this order.\n \n\n          12. DMR consistently held itself out as a party to the Settlement Agreement until August of 1993. At\nthat time, DMR abruptly changed its position without any attempt to bring this change to the attention of the\nCourt.\n \n          13. The Settlement Agreement was designed to protect JRC, the Students and their families from future\nbad faith conduct by state officials while safeguarding the state’s interest in the welfare of children.\n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n \n          14. On September 2, 1993, JRC filed a Complaint for Contempt alleging that DMR was in violation of\nthe Court Ordered Settlement Agreement.\n \n          15. On March 28, 1995, JRC filed its Revised Verified Third Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule\n65.3 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure. The amendments alleged additional acts of contempt\nwhich had occurred since the filing of the original action.\n \n          16. In its Contempt Complaint, as amended, JRC alleged that Defendant Commissioner Campbell and\nthe Department were in contempt for violating the following provisions of the Settlement Agreement:\n         \n          A) ¶ A of the Settlement Agreement in which decisions on treatment were reserved for the Court,[7]\n-\nFootnote [7] “Aversive procedures are permitted for use at JRC only when authorized as part of a Court-\nordered ‘substituted judgment’ treatment plan for an individual client, when such client is either a minor or not\nable to provide informed consent thereto...[T]hat portion of the plan which involves the use of aversive or\nextraordinary  procedures  may  be  implemented  only  upon  authorization  of  the  Court  in  a  temporary\nguardianship proceeding (or, upon Motion, to modify an existing guardianship order) utilizing the “substituted\njudgment criteria.” (Exhibit 2, at ¶¶ A-1, A-5 and A-4 (c) (ii)).\n-\n          B) ¶ B-2 of the Settlement Agreement in which Dr. Daignault was appointed Court Monitor and was to\nundertake a general monitoring of BRI’s treatment and educational program,[8]\n\n-\nFootnote [8] The Settlement Agreement states, ‘Dr. John Daignault shall be responsible for overseeing JRC’s\ncompliance with all applicable state regulations, except to the extent that those regulations involve treatment\nprocedures authorized by the Court in accordance with Paragraph A.” (See Exhibit 2, ¶ B-2).\n-\n          C) ¶ B-2 of the Settlement Agreement, in which Dr. Daignault was also responsible for arbitrating any\ndisputes  between  the  parties.  In  the  event  that  any  party  disagreed  with  Dr.  Daignault’s  decision  or\nrecommendation, he was to submit the matter to the Court for resolution,\n \n          D) ¶ L of the Settlement Agreement which state that “[E]ach party shall discharge its obligations under\nthe terms of this agreement in good faith.” (Exhibit 2 at ¶ L), and\n \n          E) ¶ C-3 of the Settlement Agreement which states, “Upon the execution of this agreement, intake at\nJRC for new clients shall be reopened and shall not be impermissibly obstructed during the pendency of this\nproceeding.” (Id. at  ¶ C-3).\n \n          17. DMR has asserted that it is not a party to the Settlement Agreement and, even if it is, that it has not\nengaged in any violations of the Settlement Agreement. DMR has also argued that the “good faith” provisions\nof the Settlement Agreement require DMR to engage in good faith in only with respect to the Settlement\nAgreement and, to the extent that DMR has engaged in bad faith (which DMR does not concede), it is bad\nfaith which is not covered by the Settlement Agreement.\n \n          18. The Settlement Agreement allowed JRC and its students to recover from the damage caused by the\ncontroversy of 1985-1986. From 1987 through 1993, JRC and its students enjoyed tremendous benefits from\nthe JRC  treatment programs.  (These  are set  forth  in  the findings  of  this Court  in  the  various  individual\nguardianship actions.)\n \n          19. Following the Settlement Agreement, the Department of Mental Health drafted regulations\nconcerning the use of “Level III” procedures, which included certain aversive procedures utilized at JRC. See\n105 CMR 20.15. The parties have agreed that those regulations have been unchanged since they were first\ninstituted. The regulations  were written after extensive discussion and consultation with Dr. Daignault who was\ninstrumental in their formulation.\n \n\n          20. DMR regulations require that programs utilizing Level III procedures be “certified” by the\nDepartment of Mental Health (which authority was subsequently transferred to the Department of Mental\nRetardation).[9]\n-\nFootnote [9] The  certification process was intended to  certify “programs”. Individual  treatment decisions\nutilizing Level III Aversive were reserved for the Court in the Individual Guardianship Proceedings.\n-\nJRC applied for certification in 1988. On April 20, 1989, JRC was granted certification for a two year period.\n \n          21. Attached to the initial grant of certification was a memorandum prepared by DMR General Counsel\nKim  Murdock concerning  the behavior  modification  regulations. (Exhibit  15).  ¶  14 of  the  memorandum\naddressed the potential for a conflict between substituted judgment orders of the Probate Court and DMR\nregulations. ¶14 of the memorandum noted that the Department’s treatment plans should not be amended until\nafter a substituted judgment hearing before this Court, and stated that such interpretation of the regulation “is\nnecessary to prevent conflicting decisions by Departmental Hearing Officers and the Probate Court, since\nobviously an Executive Branch Hearing Officer cannot overrule Court decisions.” (Emphasis added.) The\nmemorandum also noted that such a practice was “consistent with Departmental practice in Rogers cases.” (Id.\nat p. 4, ¶14).\n \n          22. Although allowed to do so, DMR did not participate in the innumerable substituted judgment\nproceedings involving JRC clients in this Court until sometime after August 1993 when DMR adopted a\ndrastically different JRC policy.\n \n                   23.  The  evidence  in  this  case  establishes  that  DMR  has  represented  to  the  Courts  of  the\nCommonwealth,  including  the Supreme  Judicial  Court,  as well  as  third  parties, that  it  is  a party  to  the\nSettlement Agreement and bound by its terms. See, In Re:McKnight, Brief of Appelant DMR, p. 6.[10]\n-\nFootnote [10] The brief was originally filed in the Appeals Court. The Supreme Judicial Court took the case\non direct appellate review.\n-\nIn DMR’s brief to the full bench, the Assistant Attorney General stated on p. 6:\n“That action was resolved by a Settlement Agreement, entered as an order of the Probate Court, on January\n7, 1987 (App. 37-57). DMR is a party to that Settlement Agreement, having been joined by order of the\n\nProbate Court dated December 29, 1988, in response to DMR’s motion, which was grounded on DMR’s\nrole in licensing and regulating providers of treatment for autism.”\nDMR’s course of conduct prior to August of 1993 established that it was a party to the Settlement Agreement.\n \n          24. After execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Court Monitor, Dr. Daignault, had several\nmeetings with Mary McCarthy, who at the time was the Deputy Commissioner for the Department of Mental\nRetardation.[11]\n-\nFootnote [11] DMR was then part of the Department of Mental Health. Later Mary McCarthy became the\nCommissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation when DMR became an independent agency.\n-\n \n          25. Dr. Daignault had a good working relationship with Commissioner McCarthy. Between October\n1986  and September  of  1988,  he had  numerous  meetings  with her  regarding  JRC.  The primary  issues\nconcerned JRC’s licensure  and certification. (Licensure  relates to the  facilities; certification  relates to  the\nprogram.) General Counsel of DMR, Kim Murdock, attended a number of these meetings.\n \n          26. In 1987 Dr. Daignault successfully exercised his role as mediator in a dispute wherein JRC alleged a\nDMH official was wrongfully interfering with intake. DMR representatives attended the mediation meeting.\n \n          27. JRC requested mediation under ¶B-2 of the Settlement Agreement which resulted in another\nmediation meeting on or about May 1987, concerning the lack of referrals from DMR.\n \n          28. At no time did DMR question Dr. Daignault’s authority in acting as Court Monitor.\n \n          29. On October 30, 1989, Deputy General Counsel of DMR, Margaret Chow-Menzer, who is counsel\nof  record  herein,  wrote  a  letter  to  Dr.  Daignault  specifically  invoking  the  provisions  of  the  Settlement\nAgreement “as amended on December 29, 1988.”\n \n          30. On or about November 18, 1989, counsel for JRC requested Dr. Daignault convene a mediation\nmeeting concerning ‘licensure’ of JRC. Within two months, JRC received licenses for its facilities which, the\n\nCourt finds, were the direct product of the mediation session.\n \n          31. Dr. Daignault was also required to oversee JRC’s compliance with regulations. On January 19,\n1990, General Counsel Murdock wrote to Dr. Daignault concerning abuse complaints stating that she had\nreviewed the complaints and concluded that the acts fall within the category of treatment JRC is authorized to\nuse (See Exhibit 23, p.2). She forwarded the complaints to Dr. Daignault as the Court Monitor, and indicated\nthat if the treatments were not authorized, DMR would be required to conduct its own investigation. Based on\nhis investigation, Dr. Daignault ultimately concluded that no abuse had occurred nor was there a violation of the\nCourt Ordered treatment plans.\n \n          32. The relationship between Dr. Daignault and DMR remained productive. On February 14, 1990,\nAttorney Chow-Menzer wrote to Judge Rotenberg notifying him that the Department had arranged for a\nparticular psychologist to serve as a “DMR expert” in response to a request from Dr. Daignault.[12]\n-\nFootnote [12] The Settlement Agreement states that DMR is obligated to provide technical assistance to Dr.\nDaignault as he might request.\n-\n \n          33. On February 28, 1992, the Office of Quality Assurance for the Mental Retardation Consent\nDecrees (“OQA”) sent a letter to Commissioner Campbell concerning two clients who were members of the\nclass of students protected by Federal Court consent decrees. The letter raised questions concerning JRC’s\nuse  of  behavior  modification  procedures  with  respect  to  these  two  clients  who  were  now  at  JRC.\nCommissioner Campbell authorized General Counsel Murdock to prepare a response.\n \n          34. On March 27, 1992, Attorney Murdock responded as follows:\n \n“As you know, due to past litigation, the Department is currently bound by a Settlement Agreement with\nrespect to this program. All so-called aversive interventions used at JRC must be approved by the Bristol\nCounty Probate Court; the Department’s involvement in the actual treatment is limited. If you still desire details\non the treatment of the two class members mentioned in [your] letter, I suggest that you contact the Court\nMonitor for the JRC case, Dr. John Daignault.” (Emphasis supplied).\nThis letter constituted a candid acknowledgment that the Department was a party to the Settlement Agreement\nand therefore did not have unilateral authority over treatment interventions approved by this Court.\n\n \n          35. With respect to the statement quoted above, it should be noted that Commissioner Campbell\ntestified it was Ms. Murdock who had advised him that he was not a party to the Settlement Agreement.\n \n          36. As late as March 1993, DMR continued to acknowledge the Court Monitor’s authority. On March\n15, 1993, DMR Deputy General Counsel, Margaret Chow-Menzer, sent Dr. Daignault a letter regarding the\nuse of “DMR expert” Dr. Frederick Krell. (Exhibit 65) In this letter she stated :\n“In my reading of the Settlement Agreement, it is the Court Monitor who is responsible for overseeing JRC’s\ntreatment and educational program and to ‘report to the court concerning any issues he deems necessary\nrelating to the health, safety, or well-being of any JRC client.’ The Settlement Agreement clearly reflects the\nunderstanding of the court and the signatory parties in your [Dr. Daignault’s] ability as the court appointed\nmonitor to make the threshold determination of whether a JRC treatment program was presenting a serious\nrisk to the JRC student. The Agreement squarely places the responsibility on you to alert the court if in your\njudgment such a risk existed.”\n \n          37. In a letter dated March 22, 1993, General Counsel Murdock noted that Commissioner Campbell\nwished to testify on a bill before the legislature which would “prohibit aversive treatment.” (Exhibit 67) Ms.\nMurdock stated in this letter, “As Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation, he feels strongly\nthat the Commonwealth should follow the lead of other states that have prohibited such treatment, as a matter\nof public policy.”\n It went on to state as follows:\n“I have advised the Commissioner of my concern that the Settlement Agreement in the original JRC/OFC\nlitigation (while it does not specifically address the situation) may be interpreted by some to prohibit him from\ntaking the position on the legislation. As you know, the Department has historically been neutral on this bill. The\nCommissioner has assured me that it is not his intention to violate a legal obligation.”\n \n          38. JRC responded by registering its objection to Commissioner Campbell’s testimony. Accordingly,\nthe Commissioner did not testify on the bill.\n \n          39. JRC received it certification in April of 1989, due to expire April 1991. On December 5, 1990,\nJRC wrote to DMR, requesting an application for recertification.\n \n          40. It took DMR more than six months to respond by finally mailing the application for recertification.\nThe Department then gave JRC only thirty days to submit the application with its supporting documentation.\n\nJRC complied on July 31, 1991.\n \n          41. Following the receipt of JRC’s application for recertification, the Department assigned a team to\nevaluate the application and make a site visit to JRC. The team consisted of George Casey, Esq., an attorney\nemployed by DMR, and Dr. Kevin Reilly, the Chief Psychologist at the Wrentham State School. Dr. Reilly and\nAttorney Casey made a site visit to JRC on December 9-10, 1991. They reviewed voluminous materials and\nmet with a number of employees at JRC.\n \n          42. On December 21, 1991, Attorney Casey prepared a report concerning JRC’s request for\ncertification. The report recommended that JRC be recertified to employ aversive procedures, subject to five\nconditions which Attorney Casey characterized as “minor” and which concerned the functioning of the Human\nRights Committee. The report also included compliments about JRC which concluded that the programs at\nJRC were  in conformity  with DMR  regulations and  the directives  of the  Bristol County  Probate  Court.\nAttorney Casey and Dr. Reilly had reviewed the specialized food program and the GED program during the\nsite visit to BRI.\n \n          43. DMR took no action regarding the certification report dated December 21, 1991. Finally, almost six\nmonths after the report was submitted, Amanda Chalmers, the Department’s designee, notified Dr. Israel, the\nDirector of JRC, by letter dated June 10, 1992, that DMR had “accepted the recommendations of the team\nheaded by Attorney Casey”, and incorporated the five minor conditions in the Casey Report. DMR did not\ngrant certification to JRC at this time even though this was the major recommendation of the Casey Report.\n \n          44. On July 21, 1992, Ms. Chalmers sent another letter to Dr. Israel stating that, since her letter of June\n10, 1992, two new behavioral programs had been “brought to my attention which should be reviewed as part\nof the recertification process”: the Specialized Food Program and the GED Program. Ms. Chalmers also\nannounced in this letter of July 21, 1992, (Exhibit 46) that she would be assembling a review team, which\nwould include a nutritionist and a physician, to return to JRC with the express purpose of reviewing the\nSpecialized Food Program and the GED Program. [13]\n-\nFootnote [13] The GED Program is a Court-approved procedure which involves an electrical stimulus which is\nutilized when a client engages in a maladaptive behavior. Likewise, the Specialized Food Program was Court-\nauthorized.\n \n          45.  Contrary to her assertion, the Specialized Food Program and the GED Program were known to the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation at the time of the visit by the Casey Certification Team in December of\n1991. Commissioner  Campbell himself  had been  informed  of these  two programs  in a  memorandum  of\n\nOctober 31, 1991 from his Director of Human Rights, Neil R. Lazara.\n \n          46.  On May 5, 1993, the second full review team came to JRC to conduct its evaluation of JRC’s\napplication for recertification. The team included Dr. Anne Myers, a DMR physician working at the Fernald\nSchool, Dr. Jens Lauridsen, a DMR physician also working at the Fernald School, Irene Whalen, R.D., a\nnutritionist working at the Fernald School, as well as Dr. Kevin Reilly and Attorney George Casey.\n \n          47. The second review team determined that JRC had complied with all five prior conditions of\ncertification in the December 21, 1991 report. The team also concluded that there were no adverse health\neffects from either the GED-4 ( a stronger version of the GED) or the Specialized Food Program. The team\nconcluded that a majority  (90) percent of the non-obese students  in the Specialized Food  Program had\nactually gained weight or remained stable under the program. (Exhibit 75, p. 4). The team could discern “no\nadverse health consequences of the Specialized Food Program” as currently practiced at JRC and as practiced\nover the past three years. With respect to the GED-4, it was the opinion of the team and, in particular, the\nopinion of Dr. Lauridsen, that the amount of power utilized was “extremely low and not harmful to anyone”.\nFurthermore, the GED-4 was found to have all the safety features of the original GED device, as described in\nCourt papers.\n \n          48. The second review team concluded that after a “thorough” investigation, the present use of the\nGED-4 Program  and the  Specialized Food  Program were  being carried  out “within  the mandate  of the\nregulations of the Department of Mental Retardation”, and stated “there is no reason to change the previous\nrecommendation that JRC retain its certification to employ Level III interventions in behavior modification\nprograms.” (Id. at p. 11). The team recommended that JRC be certified to employ Level III interventions with\ntwo minor provisions [14].\n-\nFootnote [14] One provision would require JRC to inform DMR in the event that changes were made to the\nGED device (such as an increase in power), and the other would require an enhanced record keeping for the\nSpecialized Food Program . (Exhibit 75 at p. 11)\n-\nIt was clear that the team found JRC to be in full compliance with the regulations.\n \n          49. Attorney Casey considered the July 15, 1993 report to be “complete”. He forwarded the report to\nGeneral Counsel Murdock at the Central Office of the Department of Mental Retardation. No one in the\nDepartment spoke to him about the report and, to his knowledge, no one spoke with any members of the team\nconcerning the report. No one ever suggested to him that the report was incomplete.\n\n \n          50. After the second team visit, Attorney Casey also requested certain information concerning “misfires”\nof the GED device. [15]\n-\nFootnote [15] “Misfires” are situations where the device is activated spontaneously because of some electrical\ninterference.\n-\nAttorney Casey discussed this issue with a variety of JRC staff members and reviewed certain materials from\nJRC relative to the “misfires”. The team concluded that the misfires were “not frequent enough to have an\nimpact on the safety aspect of the GED, but the information concerning the misfires had been requested after\nthe site visit”.\n \n          51. With the exception of Dr. Riley, who had since left DMR, all members of the review team signed the\nreport which was submitted to Attorney Murdock. This court finds that the report was complete.\n \n          52. The report of the Certification Team was never read by Commissioner Campbell, Dr. Mary Cerreto\nor  any  of  the  key  individuals  who  were  making  decisions  on  JRC’s  certification  until  1995.  In  fact,\nCommissioner Campbell never read the certification report until after his deposition in 1995. As Commissioner\nCampbell testified, no member of the Certification Team was brought into any of the subsequent discussions\nabout  certification and  none of  them were  contacted  to analyze  or assist  in  the  evaluation of  follow-up\ninformation presented by JRC. This fact alone is strong evidence of the bad faith purpose of those discussions.\n \n          53. Commissioner Campbell gave contradictory testimony between his deposition and trail concerning\nhis awareness of the certification reports. [16]\n-\nFootnote [16] The Commissioner testified at trial that he received the first report of the certification team in\nDecember of 1991. (Tr. June 28, p. 69, 1. 22-24). However, he testified in his deposition that he did not ever\nrecall receiving a report from Mr. Casey or Dr. Riley concerning their review of JRC in 1991. Nor had he read\nthe 1991 report as of the date of his deposition. (Tr. June 2,. p. 70 to p. 71). He also testified in his deposition\nthat he had not read the report of the second review team on the day of his deposition. Id. He testified that at\nthe weekly certification meetings concerning JRC which commenced in the summer of 1993, the 1991 and\n1993 reports of the certification team were never discussed. (Tr. June 28, p. 74.) While the Commissioner\nattempted  to  testify  at  trial  that  he  was  informed  by  his  General  Counsel  that  the  July  1993  report\nrecommended certification, the only thing he could recall about the reports in his deposition was that Attorney\nMurdock told him that the report was incomplete. (Tr. June 28, p. 74 & 76).\n\n-\nCommissioner Campbell admitted that there was an inconsistency between the testimony in his deposition and\nhis testimony at trial. Dr. Mary Cerreto, the Commissioner’s chief clinical advisor on recertification, also never\nread the 1991 and 1993 reports, even though she knew three members of the second team.\n \n          54. Commissioner Campbell asserted that the 1993 certification team report was not “complete”. His\nonly justification for considering the report incomplete was the fact that it was not signed by Dr. Riley.\n \n          55. Commissioner Campbell’s testimony, regarding the lack of completeness of the Certification Team\nReport, is striking in light of the fact that he did not even know what instructions were given to the certification\nteam and, indeed, had no idea what the team was asked to do.\n \n          56. Commissioner Campbell never revealed the existence of or sent a copy of the 1991 or 1993\ncertification reports to the Court Monitor, JRC, the funding agencies of JRC, the parents of JRC students, or\nthe Court. (Emphasis supplied). [17]\n-\nFootnote [17] In fact, the very existence of these reports did not become known until days before the start of\ntrial, as part of DMR’s response to Discovery Requests.\n-\n \n          57. In spite of all this, Commissioner Campbell acknowledged that he used some of the information of\nthe certification team reports in his subsequent communications to parents, funding agencies and this Court.\n \n          58. In the spring of 1993, CBS News contacted the Department of Mental Retardation concerning an\nupcoming program which CBS wanted to do on JRC for the “Eye-to Eye” program and requested certain\ninformation relative to JRC. (See Exhibit 255).\n \n          59. Commissioner Campbell spoke to the producer and was concerned that the show might depict the\nDepartment as not doing its job in regulating JRC.\n \n          60. Commissioner Campbell met with Under Secretary of Executive Office of Health and Human\n\nServices (EOHHS), Janet George, concerning the upcoming CBS program.\n \n          61. Commissioner Campbell testified that he never did anything in anticipation of the upcoming CBS\ntelevision program. This testimony was false. It was given before the Commissioner was presented with notes\nand agendas of his “Tuesday Morning Meetings”(discussed infra.). These notes demonstrate that various DMR\nactions, such as the mailing of letters to parents, were strategically planned “in anticipation” of the Chung\nprogram.\n \n          62. This Court finds that Commissioner Campbell’s concern as to how his agency might be depicted in\nthe upcoming CBS television program was at least part of the reason why he abruptly changed his position\nconcerning both the Settlement Agreement and the JRC program. The Commissioner’s concern in that regard\nhad absolutely nothing to do with the welfare of JRC clients, but was a material part of the Commissioner’s\ndecision making.\n \n          63. On August 6, 1993, Commissioner Campbell mailed the first in a series of letters, the “August 6\nLetter” to JRC, which was ultimately sent to all JRC out-of-state funding agencies, as well as JRC parents.\n(Exhibit 82). The August 6 Letter was also provided to the Court in the Report filed by DMR on September\n22, 1994 and appended to the Commissioner’s Affidavit filed with this Court on February 16, 1995.\n \n          64. While this letter purported to grant “interim certification” to JRC, it was in reality the first volley in a\nseries of actions designed to put JRC out of business.  The Letter contained calculated statements which\nCommissioner Campbell and his staff knew were false, or which were made in reckless disregard of the truth.\n \n          65. Commissioner Campbell’s August 6 Letter was based upon the Commissioner’s “new” position that\nhe was no longer a party to the Settlement Agreement. This “new position” has no factual or legal merit. The\nCommissioner testified that he was relying upon legal advice during this period of time. Such legal advice,\nhowever, is not a defense to a contempt action.\n \n          66. Commissioner Campbell stated in the August 6 letter that JRC had engaged in “continued and\nrepeated noncompliance with [Department of Mental Retardation] regulations.” This of course was contrary to\nthe report of the DMR certification teams lead by Attorney Casey. The second certification team report was\ndated  July  15,  1993, approximately  three  weeks  prior  to  this  letter.  Prior  to  the  August  6  Letter,  the\nDepartment had never given any notice to JRC that its treatment plans were no longer in compliance with the\nbehavior modification regulations.\n \n\n          67. Commissioner Campbell further stated in the August 6 letter that his agency had been unable to\nconclude that the Specialized Food Program or other ‘painful interventions” were supported by professionally-\nacceptable evidence for use on clients, or were “effective in such use”. The Commissioner made this statement\neven though Court decisions upon Evidentiary Hearings firmly established that the procedures utilized at JRC\nwere effective. [18]\n-\nFootnotes [18] (See,e.g., Findings of Fact of March 12, 1992, (Exhibit 240) ¶ 20, finding that there was a\n\"notable unanimity of professional opinion in that case\" that the GED was an \"effective and medically-safe\nbehavioral treatment technology.\"  This Court decision was entered after four days of hearings which the\nDepartment  of  Mental  Retardation  chose  not  to  attend.    Reports  from  psychologists  retained  by  the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation to participate in JRC proceedings establish that, as of August 6, 1993, the\nDepartment had in its files compelling evidence that the GED procedures and other procedures utilized at JRC\nwere  professionally-acceptable  and  effective.    On  April  29,  1993,  less  than  four  months  before  the\nCommissioner's letter, the Commissioner's legal department received a report from a psychologist retained by\nthe Department in ongoing JRC treatment plan reviews.  This psychologist, Dr. Frederick Krell, had  sent the\nDepartment a report in this case for a profoundly-handicapped young man, whose initials are J.V., expressing\nhis opinion that the treatment program at JRC, including the GED device, was \"more effective than any other\nintervention  which was  applied  over the  previous  17 years\"  for  this client.    (Exhibit 244,  p.  10).   The\nCommissioner  acknowledged  that  this  was  the  type  of  information  which  was  relevant  to  the  issue  of\neffectiveness,  (Tr.  June  28,  p.  111,  1.  12-19),  but  it  was  not  considered  even  though  it  was  in  the\nDepartment's own files.\n-\n \n          68.   Commissioner Campbell was unable to show that JRC had ever been asked to provide evidence\nthat the GED-4 and the Specialized Food Program were professionally acceptable. \n \n          69.  This Court concludes that Commissioner Campbell's testimony that he had been unable to conclude\nwhether the treatment at JRC was effective, was without factual basis and in deliberate ignorance of clinical\ninformation prepared by psychologists retained by him, and contained in his office files.\n \n          70.  On page 3 of the August 6 Letter, Commissioner Campbell asserted that the certification team\nheaded by Attorney Casey \"felt unable to reach a conclusion on whether the issue of GED misfires presented a\nproblem for [JRC's] ability to comply with Section 20.15.\"  This assertion was also false.  The team obviously\nreached no such conclusion.  The only material finding relative to the issue of misfires was Dr. Lauridsen's\nconclusion that the misfirings were infrequent and did not present a danger to the health and safety of the clients\nin the JRC program.[19]\n-\n\nFootnotes [19] In his August 6 Letter, Commissioner Campbell failed to acknowledge the findings of this\nCourt on March 12, 1992, wherein this Court found that JRC had made a variety of technical changes to the\nGED device significantly reducing the number of misfires and that \"there is notable unanimity of professional\nopinion here -- i.e., the GED is an effective and medically safe behavioral treatment technology.\"  (Exhibit 240\nat pp. 7-8)\n-\n \n          71.  Commissioner Campbell also determined in the August 6 Letter that a \"review of the Human Rights\nCommittee showed that there was little or no discussion, questioning, or analysis of treatments proposed to\nJRC clients.\"  Yet, Attorney Casey had reviewed the minutes of six Human Rights Committee meetings in\n1991 and had spoken with the Human Rights officer.  In fact, Attorney Casey testified that when he returned\nto JRC in 1993, he found that JRC was complying with the five recommendations for change he had made in\nthe 1991 report concerning the Human Rights Committee.\n \n          72.  On page 5 of the August 6 Letter, Commissioner Campbell imposed several conditions upon JRC\nbased upon JRC's alleged \"continued and repeated non-compliance with the requirements of the regulations.\" \n(This statement contradicts the 1991-1993 DMR certification reports that JRC was in full compliance with\nregulations  of the  Department  and, indeed,  was  operating  \"within  the  mandate of  the  regulations  of  the\n[DMR]....\")\n \n          73.  Also included in the August 6 letter was the requirement that JRC provide DMR, within 21 days, a\n\"list of aversive techniques and an existing description of how such techniques are used at JRC.\"  Yet, Attorney\nCasey testified that this information had been given to the certification team by JRC and reviewed by the team. \nA further condition of approval was that JRC provide copies of any published \"peer-reviewed professional\nresearch,\" even though Attorney Casey remembered that some of this material had already been reviewed by\nDr. Riley.  Commissioner Campbell undertook no inquiry to determine whether the Certification Team already\nhad this information.\n \n          74.  Although Attorney Casey and Dr. Riley had already reviewed behavior treatment plans and had\ndetermined that the plans were in conformity with the regulations, Commissioner Campbell required that JRC\nprovide,  within  21  days,  a  sample  treatment  plan  for  Level  III  interventions  \"which  complies  with  the\nregulation.\"\n \n          75.  After taking no action for more than two years on JRC's application for recertification (submitted in\nJuly 1991,) Commissioner Campbell in his August 6 letter, implied that JRC had failed to make its case for\ncertification and granted JRC only twenty-five days of conditional certification.  The letter also implied that\nJRC failed to respond to the Department's requests for information. Infact, JRC had fully complied with allof\n\nDMR's requests for information.  The Commissioner's letter falsely implies to the contrary.\n \n          76.  The August 6 letter was calculated to portray JRC in a false and negative light.  The letter\nmisrepresents the findings of the certification team and fails to disclose other material findings of the certification\nreport, particularly, the fact that the team had recommended certification.\n \n          77.  The significance of the August 6 letter and later certification letters, is that it was not simply a\ncommunication  between  two  parties,  an  Administrative  Agency  and  an  entity  subject  to  its  regulatory\nauthority.  The August 6 letter was widely distributed to parties who would be alarmed and misled by its\ncontents: the Court, Out of State Funding Agencies and JRC Parents.\n \n          78.  Attached to the August 6 letter was a copy of a letter from Dr. Paul Jansen[20] (Exhibit 81) which\nmade certain allegations against JRC.\n-\nFootnote[20] Dr. Jansen is a psychologist who was retained by counsel for the wards in a number of JRC\ncases.\n-\n \n          79.  In the August 6 letter, JRC was directed to respond to the allegations of Dr. Jansen.  The\nallegations of Dr. Jansen's letter were never substantiated by the Department, nor had the Department followed\nthrough and requested from Dr. Jansen the documentation which Dr. Jansen indicated in his letter he would be\nprepared to provide.[21]\n-\nFootnote[21] At trial, the Commissioner testified that steps were undertaken to substantiate the allegations of\nDr. Jansen's letter prior to the time that it was communicated to funding agencies.  Yet in his deposition he\ntestified in a completely contrary fashion stating that no steps were taken by him to substantiate the allegations\nof Dr. Jansen.  The Commissioner was again compelled to acknowledge the inconsistency between his sworn\ndeposition testimony and sworn trial testimony.\n-\n \n          80.  Commissioner Campbell testified that he considered contacting the Court Monitor prior to writing\nthe letter of August 6, 1993, but elected not to.\n\n \n          81.  This Court finds it significant that the August 6 Letter was sent by Commissioner Campbell prior to\nany attempt to apprise the Court, or the Court Monitor, of the serious allegations which were made in the\nletter.  Moreover, the Commissioner failed to inform this Court, the Court Monitor, or any other party that he\nhad decided that he was no longer a party to the Settlement Agreement and was not bound by any of its\nprovisions.\n \n          82.  In response to the August 6, 1993 letter, JRC requested a meeting with DMR.  The Department of\nMental Retardation declined to meet with JRC if the Court Monitor was to participate in the meeting.\n \n          83. On August 19, 1993, JRC’s counsel sent a letter to counsel for the Department, David Ferleger,\nEsq., requesting mediation pursuant to ¶B-2 of the Settlement Agreement.  Mediation was again requested by\nJRC on August 24, 1993.  Counsel for the Department, David Ferleger, Esq., informed JRC’s counsel that it\nwould not meet with either Dr. Daignault or Attorney Briggs present.\n \n          84. On August 19th, in response to JRC’s first request for mediation with  the Court Monitor, Attorney\nFerleger wrote to the Court Monitor alleging a conflict of interest.  Specifically, Attorney Ferleger requested\ninformation  regarding the  Court  Monitor’s  financial and/or  consulting  relationships  with  JRC’s  law  firm. \nCommissioner Campbell “guessed” that it was coincidental that the issue was raised when mediation was first\nrequested.\n \n          85. This issue with the Court Monitor culminated in accusations of a “conflict of interest” on the part of\nthe Court Monitor because he had performed consultations for clients of the Eckert Seamans law firm which\nrepresents JRC.  At the time these attacks were made, however, Dr. Daignault had been retained not only by\ncounsel for the wards to consult on various unrelated matters, but by other agencies of the Commonwealth,\nincluding  (as  Commissioner  Campbell  conceded  in  his  direct  examination)  the  Department  of  Mental\nRetardation.  Dr. Daignault is a highly respected and highly qualified forensic psychologist. [22]\n-\nFootnote [22] Dr. Daignault’s curriculum vitae is Exhibit 260.\n-\n \n          86. The attack upon Dr. Daignault by Attorney Ferleger constituted nothing more than an attempt to\nintimidate and harass a court official.  It was Dr. Daignault who had been overseeing JRC’s compliance with\nstate regulations during the period from 1989 to 1993 when the Department’s role in its regulatory activity and\n\nsubstituted judgment cases was virtually non-existent.  Attacks upon court officials in on-going proceedings are\nextremely rare, and the attack which took place in this case is demonstrative of the Commissioner’s bad faith. \nCommissioner Campbell would later use his own investigators to conduct an unwarranted inquiry concerning\nthe GAL, Bettina Briggs, Esq.\n \n          87. In response to the refusal of DMR to meet with the Court Monitor, counsel for JRC wrote a letter\nto Attorney General Harshbarger on August 27, 1994, again requesting a mediation pursuant to ¶B-2 of the\nSettlement Agreement.\n \n          88. In response, Assistant Attorney General Douglas Wilkins sent a letter on August 31, 1993\nresponding that the “historical understanding” of the Settlement Agreement is “not what your letter sets forth.”\n(Exhibit 90)\n \n          89. It is incomprehensible why the Commissioner would have rejected even a meeting with the Court\nMonitor or the GAL, given the past practices of the Department in mediating issues with the Court Monitor.\n \n          90. Commissioner Campbell gave inconsistent statements as to whether or not he had ever agreed to\nmediate.\n \n          91. According to the testimony of Commissioner Campbell, Attorney Ferleger of Philadelphia, PA was\ncontracted and retained privately by the Department in July of 1993 to handle the JRC certification process. \nCommissioner Campbell testified that it was a departure from ordinary practice for private counsel to be\nretained in connection with a certification application.\n \n          92. Commissioner Campbell, in response to questioning by Attorney Yogman, attempted to justify the\nenormous legal resources devoted to the JRC certification process by DMR.  The Department had many\nattorneys from its own legal staff from the A.G.’s office involved in this litigation.\n \n          93.  Specifically, Commissioner Campbell testified that he was forced to have many lawyers “heavily\ninvolved,” because just prior to becoming Commissioner, he received a telephone call from Henry Clark from\nEric MacLeish’s office to “warn me... not to do anything to JRC on Monday when I became Commissioner.”\n[23]\n-\n\nFootnote [23] Commissioner Campbell became Commissioner of DMR in July 1991.\n-\n          94. The Court, however, heard testimony on rebuttal from Henry W. Clark, who is currently a partner\nin the law firm of McNamara & Clark, P.C.[24]\n-\nFootnote [24] Mr. Clark has a Masters of Divinity degree from Harvard Divinity School and is an ordained\nminister in the United Church of Christ.  Mr. Clark also has a Doctorate from Boston College in Religion and\nSociety with a concentration in ethics.  He has taught ethics at Boston College.  Prior to becoming a partner at\nMcNamara & Clark, Mr. Clark worked at the law firm of Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott for four years,\nand prior to that at Fine & Ambrogne.  JRC has been a client of all three law firms.\n-\n \n          95. Mr. Clark testified he recalled a conversation that took place in the spring or early summer of\n1991.  He initiated that call to Philip Campbell to congratulate him on being named the Commissioner of\nDMR.  Mr. Clark and Philip Campbell had been colleagues for five or six years in the private sector when Mr.\nClark was the Director of MAAPS, the Massachusetts Association of Approved Private Schools, and Mr.\nCampbell was the Executive Director of MARC, the Massachusetts Association of Retarded Citizens.\n \n          96. Commissioner Campbell responded to the offer of congratulations by saying that now that Mr.\nClark was an attorney and Mr. Campbell was going to be Commissioner, “We  can’t talk to each other\nanymore”.  The conversation then abruptly ended.  Mr. Clark remembered this conversation very distinctly\nbecause he was stunned by the Commissioner’s response.\n \n          97. Mr. Clark was a credible witness.  Commissioner Campbell’s testimony on this subject was\nblatantly false, designed to offer justification, albiet untruthful, for the enormous legal expenses DMR has\nincurred in its unlawful pursuit of JRC.\n \n          98. On August 27, 1993, JRC delivered a written response to DMR’s August 6 Letter.  The response\nwas a point by point refutation of the false allegations contained in the Commissioner’s August 6 Letter.  It was\naccompanied by three cubic feet of significant documentation, which rebutted most of the factual allegations of\nthe Commissioner.\n \n          99. Instead of retracting the allegations contained in the August 6 Letter, Commissioner Campbell sent\n\nanother letter to JRC on August 31, 1993, which was also subsequently sent to JRC’s funding agencies upon\nwhich it depends for its referrals.  The August 31 letter also contained false information concerning JRC.\n \n          100. The letter of August 31, 1993 found that JRC was “in violation of DMR regulations,” but stated\nthe willingness of the Commissioner “to give JRC further opportunity to provide further information.” (Exhibit\n91, p. 2).\n \n          101. Commissioner Campbell stated that the field review has learned from a source “other than JRC”\nthat there were problems with misfirings of the GED device.  This statement was intended to imply that JRC\nwas being less than forthcoming concerning the issue of misfires of the GED device.\n \n          102. The statement of Commissioner Campbell concerning misfires was false. [25]\n-\nFootnote [25] Commissioner Campbell testified that it was his understanding that the source of this information\nwas General Counsel Murdock.  Yet, Attorney Casey testified that he remembered reviewing information\nprovided by JRC on the issue of misfires and had a conversation about misfires the first time he visited JRC in\n1991.  Moreover, the issue of these infrequent “misfires” had been the subject of evidentiary hearings and\nexpert  testimony in  substituted judgment  court proceedings  in  which the  Department  had  elected not  to\nparticipate.  (See findings of March 12, 1992; Exhibit 240).\n-\n \n          103. The August 31, 1993 letter also set forth a number of further conditions that JRC was required to\nmeet in order to receive interim certification.\n \n          104. Condition 1 restricted JRC to the use of procedures which were actually in use as of August 27,\n1993.  This directly contradicted orders of this Court which authorized JRC to utilize procedures other than\nthose which were specifically in use on August 27, 1993.  Instead of seeking to modify outstanding court\norders, the Commissioner departed from the established course of practice (embodied in Exhibit 15, ¶14) and\nsimply  administratively overruled  outstanding orders  of  this Court.   It  was  also a  direct  violation of  the\nSettlement Agreement in which decisions on treatment were to be made only in the Substituted Judgment\nProceedings in the Court.\n \n          105. Commissioner Campbell was aware on August 31 that JRC was authorized by this Court to utilize\n\nprocedures which it might not be using on any particular date.  These orders have been entered after careful\nconsideration and soley for the reason that a number of JRC students can suddenly engage in life-threatening\nbehavior which required a varied “menu” of authorized treatment modalities.\n \n          106. The letter of August 31, 1993 also ordered JRC to comply with all DMR regulations regarding the\nuse of mechanical restraints and other devices. (Exhibit 91, p. 6). In footnote 6 of this letter, Commissioner\nCampbell stated that mechanical restraint which is part of Court-approved behavior modification plan is not\nconsidered “prohibited restraint”.\n \n          107. There was no evidence adduced in this case that JRC had utilized mechanical restraint without a\nsubstituted judgment order or in circumstances other than those recognized as appropriate in a memo of the\nDepartment’s General Counsel. (Exhibit 15).\n \n          108. The August 31, 1993 Letter also required JRC to “cooperate fully” with an “independent”\nperformance and program review of JRC to be arranged by DMR.  This program review will be discussed in\nmore detail infra.\n \n          109. Condition 10 of the August 31 letter required JRC to notify “all funding sources” that there must be\nin  place  within  60  days  an  emergency  plan  designed  to  address  unexpected  medical,  personal,  or\nprogrammatic situations which JRC deems beyond the capacity of JRC to address.  The condition went on to\nstate that the plans “must provide evidence of the funding agency’s ability to immediately provide all needed\nservices for such clients  so as to insure that the client is not substantially endangered.”  Condition 10 could\nonly be expected to produce alarm in funding agencies and panic in parents of students at JRC.\n \n          110. Commissioner Campbell testified falsely that this condition was not intended to alarm funding\nagencies, but was based upon prior situations where JRC had unexpectedly discharged students who then\nbecame the responsibility of the Department.  When pressed by JRC counsel, the Commissioner could only\nidentify  a situation  involving  discharge which  allegedly  occurred  in  1991.   Moreover,  the  Commissioner\nacknowledged that other providers had unexpectedly terminated clients, and that no conditions similar to this\nhad ever been imposed in the case of other providers.\n \n          111. This Court finds that Commissioner Campbell gave false testimony when he asserted that\nCondition 10 was a legitimate exercise of regulatory authority in response to JRC’s unexpected discharge of a\nclient back in 1991.  This Condition was purposely designed to alarm funding agencies and obstruct JRC’s\nintake of new clients.  No funding agency would ever place a client in a private program for services when that\nprovider was being compelled at the same time to develop plans for emergency placements.\n\n \n          112. On the last day of the trial before the Court, July 14th, 1995.  Commissioner Campbell was\nconfronted with a document (Exhibit 293) which had been previously redacted by the Department when it was\nfirst introduced in evidence.  In this document (which was the September 7, 1993, workplan from the Tuesday\nMorning meetings discussed in more detail infra.), it was made evident that Condition 10 was, in fact, part of a\nplan to  place JRC into receivership  or to close  JRC down.  Even  when presented  with this  document,\nCommissioner Campbell declined to retract this obviously false testimony.  The Commissioner’s testimony\nunder oath concerning the purpose of this condition and whether or not it was designed to alarm funding\nagencies about the closure of JRC was categorically false and inconsistent with the stated purpose of the letter,\nas reflected in Exhibit 293.\n \n          113. On September 7, 1993, JRC again requested mediation concerning the August 31 letter.  On\nSeptember 10, 1993, the Court Monitor wrote to all parties requesting their participation.\n \n          114. On September 16, 1993, DMR agreed to meet “without waiver to our argument that the issues\nyou have raised are not subject to mediation under the Settlement Agreement.”  DMR still had not disclosed\nthat it was now taking the position that it was not in fact a party to the Settlement Agreement.\n \n          115. At the September 20, 1993 mediation meeting held by the Court Monitor, BRI and DMR reached\nan agreement whereby JRC would not have to comply with Condition 10, but could take up the plan for\nemergency placement of students at the regularly scheduled  “Individual Service Plan” (ISP) meetings which\nare held on a periodic basis.  This agreement was confirmed in a letter from Douglas Wilkins to JRC dated\nSeptember 21, 1993.  Once again the Commissioner testified inconsistently as to whether or not he had\nauthorized this agreement. [26]\n-\nFootnote [26] At trial Commissioner Campbell testified that he approved the agreement in advance of the time\nthat it was reached.  (Tr. June 28, p. 163, 1. 23-164, 1.5).  However, in his deposition he testified that he did\nnot remember approving the agreement. (Tr. June 28, p. 164, 1. 6-165, 1. 12).\n-\n \n          116. On September 24, 1993 Commissioner Campbell mailed copies of the August 6 and August 31,\n1993 letters to all of BRI funding agencies(Exhibit 105) after having advised counsel for JRC of his intention to\ndo so only one day prior.  The letter of August 31, 1993 contained Condition 10, the very requirement\nconcerning emergency placements which JRC wished to avoid.  Although JRC requested mediation with the\nCourt Monitor before the Department mailed the letters out to JRC’s funding agencies, the Commissioner\nrejected the request.  The Commissioner acted in total disregard for the pleas and concerns expressed by the\n\nparents of the students at JRC. [27].\n-\nFootnote  [27] The  court  heard testimony  of  three parents  during  the course  of  these proceedings.  The\ntestimony of these parents was credible and compelling.  There was dignity in each parent’s demeanor.  Their\ntestimony spoke eloquently  to the best  interest of their children,  and thus stood  in stark  contrast to  the\ntestimony elicited from the Department.\n-\n \n          117. On September 24, 1993, the same day Commissioner Campbell mailed the letters of August 6 and\nAugust 31 to all  of JRC’s funding agencies(Exhibit 105),  the Court Monitor  reported to this  Court that\nmediation under ¶B-2 of the Settlement Agreement had failed.\n \n          118. It was not customary practice to keep funding agencies advised of the certification process. \nCommissioner  Campbell  could not  explain  why  it  was  important  to  send  these  letters  out.    Moreover,\nCommissioner Campbell could not offer an explanation as to why funding agencies were not advised in this\nmailing that Condition 10 had been modified. [28]\n-\nFootnote [28] The funding agencies were not advised of the change in Condition 10 until a communication of\nOctober 4, 1993 (Exhibit 107) which referred to such change by attaching a letter of September 24, 1993. \nHowever, the damage had long been done.\n-\nThis Court concludes that the mailing of September 24, 1993 was deliberately made in bad faith with the intent\nto interfere with JRC’s relationship with its funding agencies.  The letters of August 6 and August 31, 1993\ncontained false information which the Commissioner and his staff knew was false of at the time of sending. [29]\n-\nFootnote [29] Commissioner Campbell conceded in his testimony that on the same date that he sent out an\ninaccurate letter to funding agencies that failed to include the agreement reached four days earlier, he sent a\nseparate letter to BRI and assorted counsel that accurately set forth the true status of the agreements that had\nbeen reached.  (See Exhibit 106; Tr. June 28, p. 169, 1. 20 - p. 170, 1. 3).\n \n          119. The August 6 (with Dr. Jansen’s letter attached) and August 31, 1993 letters were also sent to the\nparents of JRC’s students, allegedly to keep them informed of the status of JRC’s certification.  However,\nCommissioner Campbell failed to include either of the earlier favorable certification team reports which might\n\nalleviate some of the concerns that the parents would have upon receiving the letters.  These mailings were\ndesigned to alarm the parents, and were written in an effort to interfere with JRC’s relationship with the\nfamilies.    This  Court  therefore  rejects  Commissioner  Campbell’s  testimony  that  the  purpose  of  this\ncommunication was to keep the parents informed.\n \n          120. On September 22, 1993, Commissioner Campbell filed an unsolicited “Report to the Court”\nconcerning the “status of Behavior Research Institute, Inc.”  The 28-page document purported to summarize in\ndetail the basis for the Department’s actions as of that date, as well as JRC’s alleged violation of various\nregulations.  This report sent by DMR, which was unsigned but was attached to a cover letter to this Court\ndated September 21, 1993 signed by  General Counsel Murdock, contained blatant false  statements and\nmaterial omissions.  The report was reviewed by Commissioner Campbell before it was submitted.  This Court\nconcludes that the report constituted a fraud upon the Court and was filed with the Court by DMR and its\nCounsel knowing it was false, for the express purpose of creating the false impression that the Department was\nexercising its regulatory duties.\n \n          121. Although the appendix filed with the report contained numerous reports of DMR concerning JRC\ngoing back as far as April 9, 1991, (including the August 6 and August 31, 1993 letters), Commissioner\nCampbell intentionally omitted the two critical certification reports of December 21, 1991 and July 15, 1993\nwhich were relevant to the very issues before the Court at that time.\n \n          122. Commissioner Campbell cannot report to the Court concerning the subject matter of these two\nreports, yet fail to accurately describe their conclusions and recommendations.  Yet, this is precisely what\nCommissioner Campbell did.  No credible explanation was advanced by the Commissioner to explain this\nconduct and the false impression that is created on the Court.\n \n          123. Commissioner Campbell failed to include these reports because they would have contradicted his\nreport to the Court.  This action constitutes a serious interference with the administration of justice.\n \n          124. None of the numerous counsel associated with the case for DMR took any steps whatsoever to\ncorrect the false statements contained in the report to the Court.  This Court is not referring to subtle issues of\ninterpretation.  Important material information in this report was false.  It was incumbent upon all counsel in this\ncase, including General Counsel Murdock, who provided the report to the Court, to bring the false information\ncontained in this document to the attention of the Court.\n \n          125. This Court cannot accept that counsel was unaware of the false contents and material omissions of\nthis document because the mistakes were so clear and obvious.  The Court, therefore, also concludes that\n\ncounsel in this case, including General Counsel Murdock, made misrepresentations to the Court and knowingly\nprepetrated a fraud on the Court.\n \n          126. After the August 6, 1993 letter, Commissioner Campbell announced he had appointed Gunnar\nDybwad to the Human Rights Committee.\n \n          127. Commissioner Campbell made this appointment knowing that Gunnar Dybwad had a long-standing\nphilosophical opposition to all aversive procedures and had been a long-standing foe of Dr. Matthew Israel,\nthe Executive Director of JRC, and the JRC program.\n \n          128. While this Court recognizes the value of members of the Human Rights Committee with differing\npositions, the appointment of Gunnar Dybwad was calculated, together with other actions, to disrupt the\noperations of JRC.\n \n          129. In response to the appointment JRC, on October 8, 1993, requested mediation and the\nDepartment refused.\n \n          130. On September 24, 1993, Commissioner Campbell sent JRC another certification letter addressed\nto Dr. Israel, indicating that certification would be conditionally granted until December 15, 1993. (Exhibit\n106).\n \n          131. In this letter, copies of which were sent to funding agencies, Commissioner Campbell announced\nthat there were fourteen abuse investigations arising from complaints by former JRC staff, present JRC clients\nand/or  their  attorneys,  and  information  presented  by  JRC  to  DPPC(The  Disabled  Persons  Protection\nCommittee).  The letter characterized them as  “quite serious on their  face, and included claims  that you\npersonally(Dr. Israel) were involved in, or responsible for, abuse against specific JRC clients.” (Exhibit 106 at\n1).\n \n          132. It is the normal practice of Commissioner Campbell and DMR not to reveal allegations of abuse to\nthird parties without first having had them substantiated.  This communication constituted a startling departure\nfrom the Department’s acknowledged practice with respect to abuse investigations.\n \n          133. While Commissioner Campbellconceded thatthe allegations ofabuse against Dr. Israelpersonally\n\nwere investigated and not substantiated, the Commissioner never sent out a letter advising funding agencies of\nDr. Israel’s vindication but simply let the allegations stand.\n \n          134. In the letter Commissioner Campbell required that JRC provide him with reports of any incidents\nwhich had occurred since 1989 “except that any reports of deaths shall be provided by October 5, 1993.” \n(Emphasis not supplied).  This was misleading and likely to produce the damaging impression that deaths had\nbeen occurring at JRC and that JRC and not been reporting them.\n \n          135. The September 24, 1993 letter also announced that an “independent” consulting firm- Rivendell -\nwould be arriving at JRC to conduct a “independent” program review.  As discussed infra, this review was in\nno way independent.\n \n          136. In August, 1993, Dr. Mary Cerreto, the Assistant Commissioner for Quality Assurance, Chief\nClinician at DMR and a member of the Tuesday Morning Group, had recommended to the Commissioner that\nan independent program evaluation be done of JRC allegedly because prior evaluations which included the\ncertification reports of 1991 and 1993 were not sufficient.\n \n          137. Dr. Cerreto’s testimony in this regard was not truthful since she acknowledged that she had not\neven seen the 1993 certification report until sometime in April of 1995.\n \n          138. Dr. Cerreto was in charge of selecting the new “independent” evaluation team.  On August 30,\n1993, she sent out a “request for a proposal” (“RFP”), soliciting bids for an independent program review on\nJRC.\n \n          139. The response to the RFP was due on September 9, 1993 which was only ten days after the RFP\nwas issued and included a holiday weekend.\n \n          140. Under cross-examination, Dr. Cerreto testified that she knew of no other instance in which an RFP\nwith a ten-day turnaround had been sent out by DMR, nor could she provide an explanation for the necessity\nof this short ten-day turnaround.  Moreover, despite the fact that the policy in  the Commonwealth is to\nencourage the widest possible response to an RFP, Dr. Cerreto sent the RFP to only a select group of\nrecipients.  Dr. Cerreto’s RFP process was inconsistent with Commonwealth policy.\n \n\n          141. Although Dr. Cerreto received letters regarding the short turnaround time, complaining that there\nwas insufficient time to respond, she did nothing to expand the deadline.\n \n          142. Given the short time to respond to the RFP, only two bids were received, Rivendell and Fidura &\nAssociates.  Fidura & Associates’ bid was about 40% less than Rivendell($19,000 vs $33,000), but Fidura &\nAssociates restricted the use of any evaluation it did to the certification process.  This restriction was significant\nbecause DMR was looking for a bidder who had “experience with the strigencies of Court reporting and\ntestimony.”\n \n          143. When the two bids were received, Dr. Cerreto  distributed a memorandum to various Department\nemployees  indicating  that  Rivendell  was  her  preferred  choice,  but  requested  input  from  the  others  by\nSeptember 27, 1993. [30]\n-\nFootnote  [30]  Dr. Cerreto  provided  inconsistent  sworn testimony  with  respect  to  the responses  to  this\nMemorandum.  At her deposition, Dr. Cerreto testified that she only received two responses both of which\nwere unanimous  in favor  of  Rivendell.   Once again,  that  testimony contradicts  her  trial  testimony.   The\ndocumentary evidence is clear that she received three responses including one from Debra Grywacz who did\nnot vote in favor of Rivendell. The responses were not, as she testified at deposition, unanimous.  (Tr., July 12,\npp. 14,15).\n-\n \n          144. In response to a request from JRC dated October 8, 1993, Margaret Chow-Menzer, Deputy\nGeneral Counsel of DMR, provided JRC with a document, dated October 14, 1993 (Exhibit 307) that she\nfalsely represented to be the Rivendell response to the RFP. [31]\n-\nFootnote [31] Moreover, that document was attached to a fax from Angela Amado of Rivendell to Dr.\nCerreto, stating, contrary to Dr. Cerreto’s sworn testimony, that the Rivendell response had in fact been\nrevised at Dr. Cerreto’s request. (See Exhibit 307).\n-\n \n          145.  Although Dr. Cerreto testified that she never requested that Rivendell alter or modify its response\nto the RFP, the fax from Angela Amado of Rivendell revealed that the response had in fact been revised at\nDr.  Cerreto’s request.  This fully shows that the process was far from independent since DMR was involved\nin the selection process.\n\n \n          146. Indeed, the actual response by Rivendell to the RFP, (Exhibit 310), was never disclosed to JRC\nuntil the discovery process.  DMR attempted to conceal the actual response because the actual response\ncontains several provisions which were later dropped, when Dr. Cerreto asked Angela Amado to revise the\ndocument.  Among those provisions were: the cost of the evaluation, the fact that Hank Bersani, who was\nmilitantly opposed to the use of aversives, was one of the proposed evaluators and, most significantly, on the\nfirst full page of that document, a statement that says “The assembly of a sufficiently qualified team at such short\nnotice is close to impossible.”\n \n          147. Despite the fact that Rivendell complained, like others, that they could not put together a\nsufficiently qualified team on such a short notice, and despite the fact that their bid was one and a half times\nhigher than Fidura & Associates, Dr. Cerreto awarded Rivendell the contract.\n \n          148. The co-leader of the Rivendell team was a psychologist by the name of Richard S. Amado. Dr.\nCerreto knew Dr. Amado prior to receiving the RFP response from Rivendell.\n \n          149. In July, 1993, two months before the RFP, Dr. Cerreto had requested and received a document\nwhich was a “Call to Action by Amnesty International” from a woman named Nancy Weiss. (See Exhibit 72).\nThe  “Call  to  Action”  pertained  to  the  use  of  aversive  procedures  with  individuals  with  developmental\ndisabilities. The attachments to the document were directed at JRC. They made serious and outrageous claims\nof mistreatment by JRC.\n \n          150. Dr.  Cerreto knew when she received the “Call to Action”, that the document equated the use of\naversives with political torture.  Dr. Cerreto also knew in July of 1993 that Richard Amado was listed as the\nfirst  individual  signatory  to  that  document.  The  following  day  during  her  testimony,  Dr.  Cerreto  totally\ncontradicted her earlier testimony and denied being aware in July, 1993 that Dr. Amado was a signatory to the\ndocument.\n \n          151. A team in which the co-leader has signed a document, such as the “Call top Action”, which\nequates the use of aversives to political torture, is incapable of doing a fair, impartial and unbiased review of a\nprogram that uses those very techniques. Dr. Cerreto’s testimony that she was still convinced, despite knowing\nthat Richard Amado had signed  the “Call to Action”, that the Rivendell review could be fair and impartial is\nsimply not credible.[32]\n-\nFootnote [32] The Commissioner was also aware that Dr. Amado was a signatory to the Call to Action\n\ndocument.\n-\n \n          152. The Court finds that  Dr. Cerreto’s statement that she wanted the program review to be\nindependent is also false.\n \n          153. General Counsel Kim Murdock wrote a letter on Ocotober 14, 1993, to Dr. Daignault requesting\nthe Court Monitor’s “approval of the independent program review required as a condition to JRC’s interim\ncertification.”\n \n          154. Dr. Daignault advised Ms. Murdock that the Settlement Agreement did not provide him with the\nauthority to appove actions, but rather to mediated and arbitrate disputes.\n \n          155. On the same day that Dr. Daignault faxed his letter to General Counsel Murdock, there was a\nnotice from DMR that Dr. Daignault’s deposition was to be taken. On October 19, 1993, the Department\nwrote to Dr. Daignault, requesting that he “reconsider” his role as Monitor “at least as a matter of conscience.”\n \n          156. Dr. Daignault testified that this letter was “further evidence to me that the Department was\nembarking upon a campaign to impugn me and I felt badly that they, after years of collegiality, would stoop to\nthis level.”\n \n          157. The Department’s attack upon Dr. Daignault was completely without foundation and was based\nsolely upon an unwarranted attempt to remove him as “Monitor”. It was at this point (October of 1993), that\nDr. Daignault requested reassignment of his responsibility to conduct mediation/arbitration under the terms of\nthe Settlement Agreement. Dr. Daignault concluded that withdrawing from the mediation and arbitration duties\nwould “remove a distraction that the Department apparently was going to utilize.” Dr. Daignault also requested\nthat counsel be appointed to represent him. This Court appointed counsel for the Monitor, and appointed the\nHonorable George Hurd, as the new Mediator in this matter.\n \n          158. JRC counsel wrote to DMR in October and November of 1993 requesting copies of resumes of\nthe Rivendell Team. JRC also requested mediation in November of 1993 but DMR failed to respond. On\nNovember 12, 1993, Attorney Murdock wrote back to counsel for JRC indicating that DMR had no copies\nof the resumes of the Rivendell team, and requested that such information be provided by Rivendell. (Exhibit\n\n122). This Court does not understand how Attorney Murdock could have reasonably asserted that the award\nof that contract was made without receiving the curriculum vitae of the professionals involved.\n \n          159. By December 9, 1993, JRC had accumulated substantial evidence to demonstrate that the\nRivendell team was anything but independent and forwarded that information to DMR by filing a Motion with\nthis Court.\n \n          160. On December 10, 1993, General Counsel Kim Murdock wrote a letter to JRC indicating that she\nwas “appalled” at the materials contained in the JRC motion that had been filed the day before (Exhibit 127).\nThe Department then purported to undertake a review to determine whether the Rivendell team was sufficiently\nindependent and free from bias to conduct the program review.\n \n          161. Although DMR’s General Counsel initially stated in the letter of December 9, 1993, that she was\nappalled by the background information uncovered by JRC regarding Rivendell’s bias, DMR abruptly changed\nits position in March of 1994 and instructed JRC by letter dated March 2, 1994, that JRC’s objections to\nRivendell were “irrelevant” and that Rivendell would conduct the so-called “independent” review of JRC.\n(Exhibit 147)\n \n          162. Dr. Cerreto testified, under oath, in her direct examination by Assistant Attorney General Lucy\nWall, that she was the person from the Department who conducted the review of the Rivendell “bias” issue.\nThat testimony was totally contradicted the next day on cross-examination.[33]\n-\nFootnote [33] Dr. Cerreto was referred to her deposition wherein she testified that she had nothing to do with\nthe review of the Rivendell “bias” issue, since that issue was handled by the Commissioner’s Special Assistant\nJean Tuller. When confronted with the inconsistency, Dr. Cerreto then stated she could not recall her testimony\nfrom the previous day.\n-\n \n          163. The selection of Rivendell was the antithesis of a fair, unbiased and independent review. DMR’s\nselection  of  Rivendell  was  purposeful  and  is  an  example  of  bad  faith.  Indeed,  Rivendell  requested\nindemnification from the Commonwealth for their evaluation of JRC. (See Exhibit 310.)\n \n          164. Dr. Cerreto’s earlier testimony that there was no urgency in the timing for the response to the RFP\n\nwas also patently false.\n \n          165. Dr. Cerreto expected the Rivendell report to be completed by December 7. That date coincides\nwith the so-called “JRC D-Day” which has been referred to in Exhibit 220.\n \n          166. It was DMR’s plan to get a biased review of JRC in time for the December 15 deadline, which is\nthe date DMR planned to de-certify JRC. The review would be used to justify DMR’s decision which is\nprecisely what DMR fully expected, even before the group was selected, which is why there was a need to\nchoose a group that had experience testifying in Court.\n \n          167. It was Dr. Cerreto who was the source of working group notes which questioned what JRC would\nhave to do “not to be certified.” The desire not to certify JRC was consistent with the selection of the biased\nreview team and consistent with DMR’s overall plan to put JRC out of business.\n \n          168. Dr. Cerreto repeatedly and without hesitation lied to this Court.\n \n          169. In the late spring or early fall of 1993, Commissioner Campbell began to hold meetings which\nbecame known as  the “Tuesday Morning Meetings” which were  typically held at 8:00  a.m. on Tuesday\nmornings. The Commissioner had never held meetings such as these with respect to any other provider. The\nexistence of these meetings did not become known until the eve of trial, as part of the Discovery Process.\n \n          170. Commissioner Campbell testified in his deposition and at trial that these meetings dealt “strictly”\nwith the issue of certification, and that there was no other purpose to the meetings except certification.[34]\n-\nFootnote [34] The Commissioner’s testimony was echoed by Dr. Cerreto who testified in her deposition\nalmost identically that the purpose of the Tuesday morning group was “strictly to determine...whether BRI’s\nuse of Level III aversives complied with the Departmental regulations.”\n-\nThere  was no  evidence  to suggest  that Commissioner  Campbell  attempted to  invoke  the  attorney-client\nprivilege with respect to the discussion of these meetings at his deposition.\n \n\n          171. There were a number of individuals who attended these Tuesday morning meetings. There was a\n“large group” and a “small group.”[35]\n-\nFootnote [35] The “large group” consisted of Commissioner Campbell, Deputy Commissioner Misilo, Dr.\nMary Cerreto, Jean Tuller, Michael Kendrick, General Counsel Kim Murdock, Richard Cohen (Director of\nInvestigations), Gerry  Ryan (Director  of  Public Relations),  and Rick  O’Meara.  There were  other  DMR\nofficials who attended some, but not all of the meetings, such as Area Director, Randall Webster and Attorney\nDavid Ferleger. The “small group” consisted of Commissioner Campbell, Deputy Commissioner Misilo, Dr.\nCerreto, General Counsel Kim Murdock, Jean Tuller, and Director of Investigations Richard Cohen.\n-\n \n          172. When the exhibits relating to the Tuesday Morning Meetings were first presented to this Court,\nthere were numerous “redactions” which had been undertaken by the Department with respect to particular\ntopics discussed at the meetings. In response to JRC’s request, on June 28, 1995, the Court ordered the\nDepartment to produce unredacted documents. Although Assistant Attorney General Yogman represented that\nthe unredacted documents would be produced the following day, she failed to produce them on that day. On\nJuly 7, 1995, the Department produced a number of additional documents which revealed certain of the\n“redactions” which had appeared in the original documents. (Exhibit 321). The Department was then ordered\nto produce fully-unredacted documents, which the Department did on July 11, 1995. (Exhibits 293 to 304).\nEven  on  this  date,  however,  the  Department  had  not  fully  complied  with  the  Court’s  order,  and  four\nsubsequent unredacted documents were produced on July 12, 1995. (Exhibit 322).\n \n          173. The Department failed to promptly follow the orders of this Court to produce these documents.\nMoreover, much of the information for which the attorney-client privilege was originally invoked in support of\nthese “redactions” was done so without any basis in fact or in law. Clean copies of the documents indicate\ninvocation of the attorney-client privilege to hide information akin to a smoking gun.\n \n          174. Despite Commissioner Campbell’s continued assertion that these meetings related strictly to\ncertification, Attorney Richard Cohen, the DMR Director of Investigations, was a part of the “large group” and\nthe “small group.” The Division of Investigations is supposed to be separate from the Operation Division\nheaded by the Commissioner.\n \n          175. Commissioner Campbell testified that Mr. Cohen’s presence at these meetings was justified\nbecause Mr. Cohen was merely there to inform Operations as to the “status of investigations.” This Court finds\nthe Commissioner’s testimony concerning the reason for the presence of Attorney Cohen at these weekly\nmeetings was false.\n\n \n          176. This Court concludes that the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation, Philip\nCampbell, testified falsely under oath when he stated at his deposition and at trial that Tuesday Morning\nmeetings related exclusively to the issue of certification.  When confronted with the documents concerning\nthese meetings, Commissioner Campbell was compelled to admit on numerous instances that there were items\ndiscussed at those meetings which had absolutely nothing to do with certification.\n \n          177. Much of the additional evidence concerning the Tuesday morning meetings disclosed regulatory\nactivity  of  the  Department  which  was  highly  questionable  and  inconsistent  with  the  Department’s\nrepresentations  to  the  parents,  third  parties  and  court  officials.    Clearly,  Commissioner  Campbell  was\nattempting to conceal from this Court that these activities took place, and his counsel did nothing to correct\ntestimony that was false.[36]\n-\nFootnote  [36]  Assistant  Attorney  General  Judith  Yogman,  who  had  agreed  prior  to  trial  to  Exhibits\ndemonstrating unequivocally that the meetings were not confined to certification, did nothing to correct the\nCommissioner’s testimony at his deposition or during trial on June 28, 1995, when the Commissioner gave his\nfalse testimony.\n-\nThis court must therefore conclude that the Commissioner’s false statements were undertaken knowingly and\nwillfully.\n \n          178. From the start of these meetings, it was apparent that there were many topics that had nothing to\ndo with the issue of certification.[37]\n-\nFootnote [37] Again, it must be emphasized that as of September 7, 1993 (the date of the first agenda for one\nof these meetings), the only issue of significance before the Department was JRC’s certification status.  JRC\nhad just finished responding to the Commissioner’s August 6 Letter by providing a detailed letter to General\nCounsel Murdock on August 27, 1993 accompanied by three cubic feet of information.\n-\n \n          179. One of the first topics for discussion at the September 7, 1993 Tuesday morning meeting which\nhad nothing to do with the issue of certification, was the Department’s attack on the Court Monitor.[38]\n-\n\nFootnote [38] The version of this exhibit (Exhibit 190) was improperly redacted by DMR’s counsel to delete\ndamaging information concerning the Department’s plans with respect to Dr. Daignault, purportedly under the\n“attorney-client privilege.”  Yet, the actual document, produced on July 11th, demonstrated that the privilege\nwas improperly invoked.  (Exhibit 293).\n-\nDr. Cerreto suggested looking at the psychology code of ethics and filing a complaint with the APA Ethics\nBoard, regarding  Dr. Daignault.   Despite Dr. Cerreto’s  testimony to the  contrary, she did  follow-up by\nobtaining “1987  examples”  from the  psychology  code  of ethics.    There  is also  a  September  13,  1993\ndocument which reveals that Dr. Cerreto advised not doing anything with respect to the APA Ethics Board\n“for awhile.”  In light of these documents, this Court concludes that Dr. Cerreto testified falsely under oath\nwhen she asserted that she did nothing to follow-up on the agenda item of September 7, 1993.\n \n          180. Dr. Cerreto was also assigned the issue of determining whether JRC’s property was leased or\nowned.  She undertook this responsibility even though it had nothing to with the issue of certification or her role\nas the clinician on the team.  Even Commissioner Campbell testified that this issue had no relationship to the\nissue of certification.\n \n          181. Attorney David Ferleger was instructed at the Tuesday morning meetings to run “title searches” on\nall  JRC’s  property.    Commissioner  Campbell  admitted  that  the  purpose  of  these  title  searches  was  to\ndetermine whether or not there were “undisclosed related-party transactions” with respect to JRC.[39]\n-\nFootnote  [39]  Related-party  transactions  are  transactions  between  parties  having  an  affiliation  with  one\nanother.    Under  state  law,  such  relationships  must  be  disclosed  when  filing  applications  for  rates  of\nreimbursement with public agencies, see 808 CMR 1.04(5).\n-\n \n          182. The title searches determined that there were no related party transactions.  Commissioner\nCampbell admitted he had absolutely no basis to believe that there were undisclosed related-party transactions\ninvolving JRC, yet he commissioned the title searches on all JRC property.\n \n          183. Commissioner Campbell also conceded that the issue of related party transactions is the\nresponsibility of the Division of Purchased Services and not the Department of Mental Retardation.\n \n\n          184. Commissioner Campbell was unable to provide an explanation to this Court as to why he departed\nfrom his standard practice to undertake the title searches for JRC.  The inability of the Commissioner to offer\nany justification for conducting title searches, which were paid for by public funds, demonstrated bad faith and\nconstitutes abuse of governmental power.[40]\n-\nFootnote [40] As set forth above, the Commissioner testified that the issue of title searches was discussed\nduring the Tuesday Morning meetings which the Commissioner previously characterized as relating strictly to\ncertification.  On the afternoon of July 5, 1995, the Commissioner made admissions that were more than\nsufficient to establish that he had knowingly given false testimony in this case.  Specifically, the Commissioner\nadmitted that he was aware before he testified in the case that he commissioned title searches on JRC property\nand that this issue did not relate to certification.  He indicated that he had not forgotten that testimony and that\nhe remembered before his direct testimony that he had commissioned the title searches.  (Tr. July 5, p. 152, 1.\n20 to p. 153, 1. 13.)\n-\n \n          185. Commissioner Campbell was assigned certain responsibilities from the Tuesday morning meetings\n(which  he  also  had  to  concede  did  not  relate  to  the  issue  of  certification.)    One  such  task  was  the\nCommissioner’s responsibility to “confirm the fiscal status” of JRC and to “determine reasons for DMH rate\nbeing higher than DMR.”  There was no reason for Commissioner Campbell to question JRC’s “fiscal status”\nat this time, and there was no reason for him to become involved in an inquiry to determine why the DMH rate\nwas higher than DMR’s.\n \n          186. This Court concludes that a plan was developed at the September 7, 1993 meeting which was\nimplemented over the next year and a half to disrupt the financial operations of JRC.  There were many parts\nof this plan, including interfering with JRC’s fiscal condition, which are discussed infra.  Generally, a plan was\nformulated to disrupt the operations of JRC by every conceivable means - to allege that clients were being\nabused;  to interfere with financial operations;  to disrupt JRC’s relationship with funding agencies, as well as\nparents;    and  other  activities  which  have  absolutely  no  bearing  on  the  legitimate  exercise  of  regulatory\nauthority.  The plan also included requiring JRC to expend extraordinary funds for legal services in this litigation\nand in the related guardianship cases.  DMR attorneys suddenly became very active in these proceedings.  For\nexample, motions were filed in JRC Guardianships challenging treatment plan reviews by a Master and motions\nwere filed in said Guardianships challenging Attorney Bettina Briggs’ role as GAL.\n \n          187. The September 7, 1993 agenda indicates that it was the task of Commissioner Campbell’s Special\nAssistant, Jean Tuller, to obtain “contacts” with  states that provide funding  to JRC.  (Exhibit  293).  As\ndiscussed in other parts of this opinion, the Department then undertook a concerted effort to spread knowingly\nfalse information to JRC’s funding agencies in an effort to prevent new clients from being referred, as well as\ndisrupting current placements.\n\n \n          188. Another significant item from the September 7, 1993 meeting agenda was a task assigned to\nGeneral Counsel Kim Murdock requiring that the Attorney General’s office prepare a “receivership petition in\ncase of emergency.”  General Counsel Murdock was to include in a letter to JRC (which this Court concludes\nto be the August 31st letter) stating that “DMR would need 60 days advance notice before JRC closes.”[41]\n-\nFootnote [41] Once again, DMR counsel redacted this information from the original documents produced to\nJRC and redacted versions were again produced on July 7th, contrary to the Court’s Order.  It took until July\n11th for the unredacted versions to be produced.\n-\n(Exhibits 293 and 294).  This was a plain reference to Condition 10 of the August 31st letter which required\n60 days notice to JRC funding agencies of emergency plans.  When, on July 11, 1993, Exhibit 293 was finally\nproduced in an unredacted form (almost two weeks after this Court’s order of June 28, 1993), it indicated that\nthe Tuesday Morning Group was targeting the closure of JRC as early as September 7, 1993.\n \n          189. Commissioner Campbell testified in this proceeding that the group discussed the receivership issue\nbecause he had been informed by General Counsel Kim Murdock that JRC, during a 1985 controversy with\nthe Office for Children had precipitously withdrawn all treatment from students and that he was concerned that\nJRC would do this again placing the students in an emergency situation.\n \n          190. This testimony was patiently false and constituted an absurd attempt to explain this entry in the\nSeptember 7, 1993 agenda item.[42]\n-\nFootnote [42] Commissioner Campbell previously testified in Court on June 29, 1995, that in September of\n1993 he wanted to minimize any anxiety that the families might have with respect to an abrupt termination of\nJRC.  Commissioner Campbell testified that he was aware that in 1985 the Office for Children abruptly\nterminated service for some of the students at JRC.  Commissioner Campbell sent out a letter on September 3,\n1993, to assure the parents that there services would not be terminated at JRC.\n-\nIn the 1985 licensing dispute, treatment had been interrupted for clients of JRC, because of orders of the\nDirector of the Office For Children.  (See Preliminary Injunction Opinion of Judge Ernest Rotenberg of June 4,\n1986, at p. 16, ¶ 46).  Commissioner Campbell’s General Counsel, Kim Murdock, Esquire, (who allegedly\nprovided this information) served as counsel for OFC during that litigation.  Again, this Court concludes that\nthe Commissioner purposefully misstated the facts.\n\n \n          191. At the same time Commissioner Campbell and his Tuesday Morning group were considering the\nclosure of JRC and the imposition of a receivership, he and his attorneys were attempting to assure court\nofficials and parents that this was not their true intent.  (See Exhibit 324 letter from Murdock to Dr. Daignault\nand GAL 9/2/93.)  Approximately two weeks after the September 13th meeting Commissioner Campbell\naddressed parents of JRC students at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, denying plans to close\nJRC.  A document summarizing the Commissioner’s remarks was introduced as Exhibit 109.\n \n          192. The documents which are in existence for meetings conducted subsequent to September 7 and\nSeptember 13 reveal the utter and complete falsity of Commissioner Campbell’s testimony that the meetings\nonly  related  to  certification.    These  items  include:  documenting  former  BRI  residents’  experiences  after\ndischarge from BRI, investigating whether BRI was pursuing FDA approval for the GED device, researching\nformer BRI staff and a plan to distribute profiles on seven Massachusetts citizens who had transferred out of\nBRI and which DMR intended to release to the press through its Public Relations Director.\n \n          193. The notes from the meeting of October 19, 1993 include the notation “December 15-BRI D-Day”\nand (underlined in original) “what would BRI have to do not be certified:  two areas a capacity to obey laws\nand efficacy of treatment.”  Commissioner Campbell and Dr. Cerreto failed in their efforts to justify and\nadequately explain these notes.  Clearly, as of October 19, 1993, the Department was expecting that the\nRivendell team would be coming in November of 1994 and that the Rivendell report would be completed by\nDecember  7,  1993.    Moreover,  JRC’s  certification  would  expire  on  December  15th.    Commissioner\nCampbell attempted to testify that “D-Day” signified “a decision day.”  This Court finds that if Commissioner\nCampbell was lawfully exercising his regulatory authority and undertaking a fair and impartial decision on\nJRC’s certification, it would be improper to discuss what JRC would have to do not to be certified.  There is\nno justification for this matter as a topic of discussion, and it demonstrates Commissioner Campbell’s bad faith\nand predetermination of the certification issue.\n \n          194. At the meeting of October 19, 1993, there was an agenda item[43] on the issue of how Rhode\nIsland was able to “turn over its clients to the Groden Center.”\n-\nFootnote [43] Again, this item had nothing to do with certification.\n-\nThis issue related to the formulation of a strategy to remove DMR clients from JRC. Commissioner Campbell\ntestified that a number of years ago the state Rhode Island had stopped sending clients to JRC and instead sent\nthem to the Groden Center.\n \n\n          195. The Connie Chung Show was also a topic of discussion at the Tuesday morning meetings.[44]\n-\nFootnote [44] Commissioner Campbell was forced to concede that this subject had nothing to do with the\nissue of certification\n-\nMinutes from the October 18, 1993 meeting reveal that DMR was planning to mail a communication to\nparents “prior to the Chung Show” as well as a second letter “after Chung Show” (Exhibit 196, p.3).  At the\nmeeting of January 25, 1994, DMR staff were explicitly directed to draft letters “in anticipation” of the Chung\nshow.  (Exhibit 208).  The reference to the Chung show is repeated in other work plan agendas.  (Exhibit 197\nand 198).\n \n          196. Since Commissioner Campbell had testified earlier in the day in Court that he never did anything at\nthe meetings in reference to the Connie Chung Show, he was specifically asked whether he would like to\ncorrect his now inaccurate testimony.  He declined.\n \n          197. Several work plan agendas of the November 30, December 7 and December 14, 1993 meetings\nindicate an attempt by DMR to interfere with JRC’s rate of reimbursement, which would in turn damage the\nfiscal health of JRC.  JRC receives a rate of reimbursement which is calculated by the Division of Purchased\nServices (“DPS”).\n \n          198. At the Tuesday morning meeting of November 16, 1993, the question of whether Rhode Island\ncould set a day rate while Massachusetts sets a residential rate was raised.  Underneath that entry is a further\nagenda  item which  states as  follows:   “Pre-meeting  needed with  DPS and  DOE”    (Exhibit 199)  which\nconcerned an upcoming “pricing” meeting which was scheduled to take place between the DPS and JRC.  The\nDepartment of Education (“DOE”) was also to be in attendance at that pricing committee meeting.  By law,\nsuch meetings are public. (Exhibit 292).  A pre-meeting would be unlawful.\n \n          199. Commissioner Campbell testified that the established practice is that the issues would be discussed\nin an open meeting with the provider present.\n \n          200. The agenda item updated on December 14, 1993, reflects the intention of the committee to initiate\na “challenge process for rate review given that MA has no one under 22 at JRC.”  (Exhibit 202).  As explained\nby Commissioner Campbell, the Department of Mental Retardation was suddenly taking the position that\nbecause there were no children from Massachusetts under the age of 22 that JRC’s rate should not be set by\n\nDPS but should be negotiated between DMR and JRC.  This result would give DMR direct financial control\nover JRC.  DMR was unsuccessful in persuading DPS to change its regulatory stance of JRC.\n \n          201. The meeting of the “DPS pricing committee” occurred on December 14, 1993.  In attendance at\nthat meeting were officials from DPS, DOE, and JRC.  DMR officials participated in the pricing committee\nmeeting and took the position that JRC’s legal costs which were being incurred against the Commonwealth\nwere “non-reimbursable” because JRC was “engaged in litigation against the Commonwealth...”  (See Exhibit\n262, p. 4).[45]\n-\nFootnote [45] Evidence presented later in the trial indicate that these 1993 efforts by DMR may be bearing\nfruit now.  DPS is currently questioning JRC’s rate and the issue of legal fees being “reimbursable” for litigation\nagainst the Commonwealth.\n-\nThis  action  constituted  nothing  less  than a  deliberate  attempt  by  DMR  (with  the  full  knowledge  of  the\nCommissioner) to interfere with JRC’s prosecution of this case.\n \n          202. Commissioner Campbell’s attempts to cut off payments for JRC’s ability to retain counsel, were at\ndirect odds with his simultaneous efforts to increase compensation for his own counsel, David Ferleger.  Within\none month after his efforts to stymie JRC’s ability to retain counsel in this action, he filed requests (which were\ngranted) with the Executive Office for Administration and Finance, increasing Attorney Ferleger’s contract\nfrom $73,000 in fiscal year 1994 to $118,000.  (Exhibit 261).  Commissioner Campbell also arranged for\nAttorney Ferleger to be appointed as special assistant attorney general.\n \n          203. Commissioner Campbell conceded that the DPS rate review of JRC (as referenced in Exhibit 202)\nhad “nothing whatsoever” to do with certification.\n \n          204.  The work plan updates of December 14, 1993 and January 4, 1994, also reveal substantial\ndepartures from the Department's practice with respect to investigations.[46]\n-\nFootnote[46] With  respect to the  evidence contained  in the December  14, 1993  update, Commissioner\nCampbell started his testimony by acknowledging that it would have been  a violation of practice for the\nTuesday Morning Group to have discussed the results of an investigation before the investigation had been\ncompleted.  He then changed his testimony to state that it \"may have been\" a violation of ordinary practice\nconcerning the confidentiality of investigations before they were completed.\n\n-\nAlthough the results of the E.P. investigation [47] were not released until January 13, 1994, the December 14,\n1993 update reveals that Richard Cohen, the Director of Investigations (who was allegedly at the meetings just\nto provide \"status updates\"), informed the group that the medical care issues in the E.P. investigation \"are\nsignificant.\" (Exhibit 202).\n-\nFootnote[47]E.P. refers to a student at JRC.\n-\nWhen asked to justify why he released information concerning the conclusions of his investigation in advance,\nInvestigator Cohen stated that he needed to do so to protect the health and welfare of the client. Yet, he could\nidentify no action which was taken in December 1993 to address the unmet medical needs of this client.\n \n          205.  Commissioner Campbell agreed that he had given incorrect testimony when he testified on June\n28th that the only thing that Mr. Cohen discussed in the certification meetings was the status of investigations. \nRichard Cohen was an active member of the Tuesday AM small group.  This Court finds that he was a key\nmember of the DMR Team, assembled solely for the purpose of putting JRC out of business.  It is totally\nincredible that he merely reported on the status of investigations.\n \n          206.  The updated agenda of January 4, 1994, references as an agenda item that in the week ending\n1/14/94, \"Phil\" (meaning the Commissioner) would brief a District of Columbia official, named Vincent Gray on\nthe results of the E.P. investigation, even though the results of the E.P. investigation were still nine days away. \n(Exhibit 205).  Commissioner Campbell acknowledged that the Tuesday Morning Group had these discussions\nconcerning E.P. prior to the time that the E.P. investigation had been completed.  Commissioner Campbell\nacknowledged that this would have been a violation of DMR policy with respect to investigations.  This Court\ntherefore finds that, with respect to JRC, the DMR investigations unit breached its own investigation protocol\nby informing senior administration officials of the results of the investigation ten days before the report was\nreleased.\n \n          207.  The Tuesday morning work plans also included other issues which clearly are not related to\ncertification of JRC.  Reference to contacts with out-of-state funding agencies infer to this Court that DMR\nwas attempting to  advocate to out-of-state funding agencies  that their clients be  removed from  the JRC\nprogram.[48]\n-\nFootnote[48]Commissioner Campbell attempted to testify that his agency never advocated to out-of-state\nfunding agencies that any particular client be removed from JRC prior to JRC's decertification.\n\n-\nIt is plain that such advocacy did occur through the series of certification letters which contain numerous false\nstatements which were calculated to alarm funding agencies.  The work plan updates of January 24 and\nJanuary 25, 1994 (Exhibit 207 and 208) further demonstrate that DMR was fully engaged in such advocacy. \nThe January 24, 1994 update assigns to Commissioner Campbell and his Special Assistant, Jean Tuller, the\nissue of whether or not the District of Columbia had \"placement plans\" for E.P.  The January 25, 1994 update\ncontains the same language and also references various \"contacts\" in the District of Columbia, including a \"Dr.\nHutchinson and Norma Hatot.\"  In his testimony, Commissioner Campbell argued that even though the task of\ndiscussing \"placement plans\" for E.P. was assigned to him and Ms. Tuller, he does not remember discussing or\nadvocating such plans.  This Court finds the testimony of Commissioner Campbell on this issue not credible in\nlight of Exhibits 207 and 208.\n \n          208.  On March 1, 1994, Richard Cohen, the Director of Investigations was assigned the task of\ninvestigating whether the Commonwealth's Forensic Pathologist who performed an autopsy on a particular\nstudent of JRC, was related to the GAL in the case.  This assignment was given to Mr. Cohen even though\nCommissioner Campbell did not have any basis to believe that the GAL was biased in any way.  Once again\nthis assignment had nothing to do with the issue of certification.  Commissioner Campbell failed to give any\ncoherent explanation as to why this information was useful or why the Director of Investigations needed to be\nassigned to this task.  It was ultimately determined that there was no relationship.[49]\n-\nFootnote[49]This Court takes judicial notice of the various motions which have been filed by counsel for the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation in pending guardianship cases to remove Attorney Briggs as the GAL in\nthese cases.  The Department takes the hypocritical position that Attorney Briggs has not been doing her job,\neven though the Department has admitted in ex parte communications to this Court that it was not involved in\nthe substituted judgment proceedings to any degree prior to July of 1993.  (See Exhibit 79).  The efforts to\ninvestigate the GAL constituted an abuse of governmental power in an effort to intimidate court officials and\nremove individuals from this case that the Department regarded as obstructionist or as road blocks to the\nCommissioner's aim of closing the JRC program.\n-\n \n          209.  Up until January of 1994, notes were taken during the Tuesday morning meetings, some of which\nwere maintained by a DMR employee named Deb Grywacz.  However, there is a memorandum to Ms.\nGrywacz in December of 1993 confirming that she would no longer be attending these meetings.  (Exhibit\n322).  Agendas for the Tuesday Morning meetings and work plans were kept through the spring of 1994,\nwhen Commissioner Campbell asserted originally that the \"large group\" and \"small group\" meetings stopped. \nHowever, the Commissioner was later confronted with excerpts from his own diary scheduling a JRC \"large\ngroup\" meeting a late as December of 1994.  (See Exhibit 325).  Commissioner Campbell testified that he\ndoes not recall any other notes being taken at these later meetings.  Commissioner Campbell also testified that\nat some point there was concern about the \"discoverability\" of notes being taken at these meetings.  This Court\n\nconcludes that these meetings continued to take place throughout this litigation and the Department has either\nfailed to produce notes which were taken or issued instructions that not further notes were to be taken at these\nmeetings, in an effort to prevent the facts of what was occurring at these meetings from being revealed.\n \n          210.  On December 15, 1993, Commissioner Campbell falsely accused JRC of not reporting a death. \nThe Commissioner sent a copy of this letter to all of JRC's funding agencies, and Parents of JRC students even\nthough it contained false information which was shown to be false by records which were in the possession of\nthe Department at that time.\n \n          211.  The first page of the letter of December 15, 1993, stated as follows: \"Your failure to report a\ndeath in 1991 made it impossible for me to fulfill my responsibilities under this regulation...JRC has in the past\nfailed to report deaths and serious injuries as required by law.\"(Exhibit 128).\n \n          212.  Contrary to this assertion, JRC had not failed to report \"deaths.\"  Indeed, there was no evidence\nof any deaths of students at JRC since Commissioner Campbell assumed his duties of July of 1991. The\nCommissioner admitted in his testimony that his reference in the letter of December 15th to JRC's failure to\nreport \"deaths \" was \"an error,\" and he attempted to contend that the reference to \"deaths\" was typographical\nerror.  This Court finds that the error was not typographical but was intentional.  In fact, no student had died at\nJRC in 1991.  The only death remotely involved was the death of a student L.C. in 1990 which was reported\nby JRC to DMR.[50]\n-\nFootnote[50]  L.C.,  a  JRC  student,  died  on  December  19,  1990  at  the  Sturdy  Hospital  in  Attleboro,\nMassachusetts from natural causes.  (Exhibit 266).  The death was investigated at the time by the GAL (who\nsubmitted  a report  to  this  Court),  as  well  as  by  the Office  of  the  Chief  Medical  Examiner  and  police\ndepartment.  No wrongdoing by JRC was found.  (Exhibit 264).\n-\n          213.  During his testimony on June 29th, Commissioner Campbell acknowledged that his General\nCounsel's office had received some report of the death.  He nevertheless testified that his office did not receive\ninformation that was \"discernible\", and that it was impossible for his agency to have investigated the death.\n \n          214.  On June 30th, a document was faxed to Court which was the actual \"Client Death Report Form\"\nfor L.C.[51]\n-\nFootnote[51]During  Attorney  Yogman's  subsequent  cross-examination  of  Commissioner  Campbell,  the\n\ndocument was brought to the attention of the Court by counsel for JRC and was marked as Exhibit No. 266.\n-\nOn July 5, Commissioner Campbell admitted contrary to his testimony on June 29th, that the document did\ncontain sufficent information to permit an investigation.\n \n          215.  Counsel for the Department informed this Court that the death report had been produced during\nthe discovery process.[52]\n-\nFootnote[52]The existence of this document was clearly known to the Department insofar as General Counsel\nMurdock referred to it on page 2 of a letter of February 25, 1994 which was marked as Exhibit No. 146.\n-\n \n                   216. Yet,  on  June  29,  1995,  counsel  for  the Department  of  Mental  Retardation  permitted\nCommissioner Campbell to falsely testify.[53]\n-\nFootnote[53] The death was reported to the Office of the General Counsel of the Department of Mental\nRetardation, within nine hours after it had occurred. (Exhibit 266). The Client Death Report clearly identified\nJRC as the program where the student was residing. It gave the name of a JRC staff member and it gave the\nname and telephone of the Attleboro police officer who was investigating the death, and listed the name of the\nhospital where the surgery was performed. The only error was a slight misspelling in L.C's last name.\n-\n \n          217. Not only did Commissioner Campbell fail to retract the allegations in his letter of December 15,\n1993, But his General Counsel disseminated this false accusation to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.\n \n          218. On February 25, 1994 Ms. Murdock mailed a letter to JRC (copied to funding agencies) which\nagain criticized JRC for failing to report the death. (Exhibit 146).\n \n          219. Late January 1994, JRC learned of a Worcester meeting DMR had planned with a New York\nagency that funds students at JRC. New York is JRC's major funding source providing seventy percent of\nJRC's clients. At a meeting with DMR and Judge Hurd on January 31, 1994, JRC and Parent's Counsel\n\nrequested that Guardian ad litem, Bettina  Briggs, be allowed to  attend the Worcester  meeting. Assistant\nAttorney General Doug Wilkins agreed.\n \n          220. The meeting was suddenly canceled by DMR. JRC then requested in writing that DMR notify it of\nany future meeting or telephone conference with OMRDD. [54]\n-\nFootnote[54] OMRDD stands for Office of Mental Retardation Developmental Disability.\n-\n(Exhibit 281). DMR subsequently held a telephone conference with OMRDD officials. DMR did not notify\nJRC, the parents or the GAL of this meeting. On February 28, 1994, OMRDD wrote to the parents of all\nOMRDD clients at JRC advising them that OMRDD intended to offer alternative placements for their children\nin the State of New York. Similar communications were not sent out to parents of OMRDD clients funded in\nother out-of-state placements.[55]\n-\nFootnote[55]The Department produced a stipulation concerning the testimony of Richard Wolf, Esquire, a\nwitness whom the department attempted to call without adequate notice to JRC, and a witness who was not\non the DMR list of more than 140 witnesses. This Court would not permit Mr. Wolf to testify when initially\noffered by DMR in response to an objection by JRC and ordered the parties to meet. The parties agreed to a\nstipulation as  to what Mr.  Wolf's testimony  would have been.  The department  apparently submitted  the\ntestimony of Mr. Wolf in an effort to explain that it was not an action of DMR that accounted for this letter to\nparents and the subsequent transfer of many OMRDD students away from JRC. However, the testimony of\nMr. Wolf completely contradicts that assertion. The law upon which the Department relied was not even\npassed by the New York Legislature as of February of 1994, and contains no requirement that New York\nstudents were to leave JRC. Rather, the testimony of Mr. Wolf establishes that no other parents of OMRDD\nclients were sent communications similar to the letter of February 28th, and it is clear from the stipulation that\nOMRDD was concerned about JRC being \"decertified.\"\n-\n \n          221. This Court concludes that the meeting with New York officials was a continuation of the\nCommissioner's campaign of interfering with JRC's relationship with its funding agencies.\n \n          222. At Judge Hurd's request, DMR met with JRC February 9, 1994, in an attempt to work out the\nconditions of certification. That same day DMR issued its 19-page letter to Dr. Israel announcing the February\n9, 1994 \"final\" certification decision.\n\n \n          223. At the February 9 meeting, the Department showed Dr. Israel, the Director of JRC, an outline of\nthe conditions which required that JRC rewrite all of its behavior modification treatment plans (approximately\n55)  and  locate  two  new  psychiatrists  and  physicians  to  conduct  independent  psychiatric  and  medical\nevaluations on every JRC student (approximately 60 students) within 80 days. [56]\n-\nFootnote[56] The two psychiatrists and physicians would have to be approved by DMR.\n-\n \n          224. Dr. Israel protested that it was unethical to require all students to submit to these examinations\nregardless of their condition or need for another evaluation, and that the cost of conducting these unnecessary\nmedical and psychiatric evaluations would be prohibitive.\n \n          225. Dr. Israel informed DMR that it would be impossible for his staff to rewrite approximately 55\nCourt-approved treatment plans within 80 days and that the attempt to do so would remove key psychological\nstaff from their duties of monitoring and supervising student treatment plans.\n \n          226. The February 9, 1994 letter was again copied and mailed to funding agencies, as DMR's \"final\ndecision on the application of JRC for certification.\" (Exhibit 139).\n \n          227. This February 9 letter certified JRC through August 8, 1994 but required JRC to comply with\ntwelve more conditions by May 8, 1994. (If JRC fully complied by May 8, 1994, DMR would certify JRC for\na two-year period from that date.)\n \n          228. As a result of the condition regarding the rewriting of the treatment plans, two staff psychologists at\nBRI spent extensive time (between June and November of 1994) doing so. During this time, Dr. Worsham, a\nJRC clinician, was unable to attend to his client caseload which consisted of 16 students.\n \n          229. There was no basis for the requirement that JRC conduct independent psychiatric reviews for all of\nits clients, whether or not these clients were receiving Level III procedures. Commissioner Campbell did not\neven read the reports of these psychiatrists. Not one of these evaluations recommended the discontinuation of\nLevel III treatment procedures for JRC clients.\n\n \n          230. Commissioner Campbell could not identify any credible reason for the imposition of the condition\nregarding medical evaluations.[57]\n-\nFootnote[57] JRC possesses a comprehensive system for medical monitoring, which includes a number of full-\ntime nurses, as well as a number of consulting physicians.\n-\nIn fact, all JRC students were found to be in good health. The imposition of this condition was unnecessary and\nwas designed to disrupt the operation of JRC and cause needless expense.\n \n          231. On May 9, 1994, DMR and JRC began six weeks of intensive negotiations over the conditions of\ncertification of the February 9, 1994 letter.\n \n          232. As a result, agreements were reached and were embodied in a letter of July 5, 1994. (Exhibit\n152).\n \n          233. As discussed later, DMR then promptly proceeded to violate material provisions of this agreement.\n \n          234. For example, DMR and JRC agreed to revise Condition 1 so that rewritten behavior modification\nplans would be submitted on a weekly basis. JRC complied with this requirement.\n \n          235. Dr. Worsham met with Dr. Mary Cerreto to develop a prototype treatment plan, which was one\nof the certification conditions.\n \n          236. Prior to meeting, Dr. Worsham sent Dr. Cerreto the treatment plan for W.M., one of the most\ndifficult students at JRC. [58]\n-\nFootnote[58] W.M.'s treatment plan had the widest range of treatment options, allowing it to be the most\nappropriate model.\n\n-\n \n          237. After very extensive discussions, W. M.'s treatment plan was modified to include Dr. Cerreto's\ncomments and suggestions. She signed off by initialing each page of the treatment plan.\n \n          238. This because the model by which every other treatment plan was to be written. (Exhibit 152)\n \n          239. Dr. Cerreto never requested any major changes in the specialized food program.\n \n          240. Likewise, Dr. Cerreto did not question the use of negative reinforcement, programmed multiple\napplications, or behavioral rehearsal lessons as not being in compliance with DMR regulations.\n \n          241. Thereafter, Dr. Worsham mailed the rewritten treatment plans to Dr. Cerreto who did not respond\nfurther. Later, when Dr. Worsham received Commissioner Campbell's interim certification of January 20,\n1995, he was shocked to find that Commissioner Campbell alleged that JRC's behavior modification plans did\nnot comply with DMR regulations.\n \n          242. DMR and JRC had also agreed that DMR would review the implementation of the behavior\nmodification plans for six individuals. (Exhibit 152). DMR selected these six individuals. The reviews were\ndone and reports were produced.\n \n          243. In spite of this, Commissioner Campbell announced that Drs. Thomas Linscheid and Brian Iwata\nwould undertake a \"systems\" review of the JRC program and review two additional JRC students (despite the\nfact that the six implementation reviews were already underway).  (Exhibit 158).\n \n          244. Dr. Iwata and Dr. Linscheid's review of the JRC program was in violation of the July 5 agreement.\n[59]\n-\nFootnote [59] The agreement specifically stated that JRC complied with Condition 9, which mandated the\n\"independent\" program review which had been done by Rivendell in March of 1994. (Exhibit 152).\n\n-\nCommissioner Campbell could offer no credible reason for his breach of the July 5th agreement. This is yet a\nfurther example of how JRC tried reasonably to meet the demands of DMR and how DMR made it impossible\nfor said demands to be met.\n \n          245. JRC responded by requesting a meeting with the Mediator to discuss the situation. (Exhibit 282).\nThe Department declined to mediate the issue concerning the violation of Condition 1. (Exhibit 160)\n \n          246. The agreement of July 5, 1994 (Exhibit 152) extended JRC's certification to December 31, 1994.\nBy that time, the Department had alleged it had yet to complete its \"review\" of JRC and, accordingly, extended\nJRC's certification on a day-to-day basis. (Exhibit 165).\n \n          247. On January 20, 1995, Commissioner Campbell sent a letter to JRC indicating that JRC had not\nfully complied with certain conditions previously imposed by DMR upon JRC for certification.\n \n          248. The January 20th letter purported to extend JRC's certification, provided that six new conditions\nwere satisfied.\n \n          249. One condition required that JRC discontinue Level III interventions for six individuals, including\nB.S., the subject of a recent five day treatment plan review by Judge Jones of the Probate Court. (Exhibit 166,\np.9)[60]\n-\nfootnote [60] Judge Jones conducted a Treatment Plan Review, commencing on October 31,  1994 and\nconcluding December 21, 1994, specifically approving Level III Aversive Therapy for B. S. who was one of\nthe most difficult to treat students at JRC. DMR filed a motion for a new trial which was denied. This is\ncurrently on appeal.\n-\nCommissioner Campbell acknowledged that there was an \"obvious conflict\" between his findings of January\n20, 1995 regarding B.S. and Judge Jones' findings. Nonetheless Commissioner Campbell chose to continue\nwith enforcement of his order.\n \n          250. In addition, the January 20, 1995 letter first introduced the concept of regulatory approval of\n\ntreatment plans on a \"case-by-case\" basis. There is nothing in Commissioner Campbell's own regulations which\ngives him the power to apply certification in individual cases. Rather, the regulations speak to the question of\nwhether the program should be certified, and leave the decision on substituted judgment to the directives of this\nCourt. (See, e.g., 104 C.M.R. 20.15(4)(f)).[61]\n-\nFootnote [61] Yet, Commissioner Campbell ignored regulations by making individual certification decisions,\nspecifically excluding authorizations for JRC to use Level III interventions for six individuals, but not the other\nstudents in the program.\n-\n \n          251. Another condition of the January 20 letter was the Commissioner's decision to prohibit the\nSpecialized Food Program. He made this decision after his own team of doctors had concluded that there\nwere no adverse health effects from the program (Exhibit 75), and he failed to identify any medical evidence to\nsupport this decision.[62]\n-\nFootnote [62] The Commissioner testified that he banned specialized food even though he did not consult any\nmedical professional about the possible effects that such an action might have on the clients.\n-\n \n          252. In response to the January 20, 1995 letter, JRC requested mediation and arbitration under ¶B-2 of\nthe Settlement Agreement. (Exhibit 169). There was no response to the request for mediation until April 7,\n1995, when Ms. Chow-Menzer stated that DMR remained \"open to addressing with you directly or through\nan alternative dispute resolution any issue JRC may have regarding the certification process.\" (Exhibit 182). By\nthat time, the Commissioner had decided to decertify JRC, effective July 1, 1995, rendering the response of\nApril 7 meaningless. (See Exhibit 179).\n \n          253. JRC was decertified to use Level III treatment procedures on March 23, 1995, which was to\nbecome effective on July 1, 1995.\n \n          254. On March 24, 1995, this Court issued its decision granting JRC's request for preliminary\ninjunction.[63]\n-\nFootnote [63] Although a portion of this Court'sruling related to the Specialized Food Programwasreversed\n\nby a Single Justice, the injunction restraining DMR from proceeding with decertification was in effect. In any\nevent, the preliminary injunction is dissolved in its entirety as of the date of this decision and replaced with a\nnew remedial order.\n-\n \n          255. On April 25, 1995, this Court issued a pretrial order, requiring that discovery be completed by\nMay 18, 1995 and ordering that the case proceed to trial June 26th.\n \n          256. Prior to the June 26 trial, DMR began negotiations with JRC for an FY96 contract. In past years,\nthe negotiations  for contracts  tended to  be a  ministerial task,  and  there were  no issues  of substance  in\nnegotiation regarding the contract. However, the Department changed its position this year with respect to\nJRC. The Department has introduced into the contract negotiation matters which have been submitted to this\nCourt for resolution.[64]\n-\nFootnote [64] The Department has attempted to coerce JRC (by threatening to cut off funds in 1996) unless\nJRC accepts its determination of the \"access\" issues which have been raised in the Department's counterclaim.\n(Exhibit 313). In addition, the Department has attempted to condition payment upon JRC's acceptance of the\n\"QUEST\" principles, which is a matter in controversy in this litigation. On the last day of trial, the parties\npresented a stipulation to the effect that the Department did not \"intend\" to hold up payments to JRC if JRC\ndid not agree to a contract concerning issues which are pending before this Court in this litigation. Nonetheless,\nthe Department's position prior to that time was extremely unclear, and caused justifiable anxiety for JRC.\n-\n \n          257. A letter was sent on June 30, 1995, the fifth day of trial in this matter, after Commissioner\nCampbell had been subjected to vigorous examination by JRC's counsel on June 28 and June 29.\n \n          258. The letter directed JRC to \"cooperate with and be responsive to\" an attached memorandum from\nthe DPS dated June 28 two days after trial began, which found JRC's legal fees to be non-reimbursable.\n(Exhibit 267). The letter warned JRC that in the event public funds were used for litigation purposes, they\ncould be \"subject to recoupment.\" (Exhibit 267).\n \n          259. The letter constituted a purposeful attempt by DMR to interfere with on-going court proceedings\nand disrupt JRC's ability to continue to retain its counsel. Commissioner Campbell was compelled to admit on\nJuly 5, 1995 that he had some awareness that a communication like this would be sent out. This type of\n\ncommunication placed JRC in the unhappy position of continuing with this litigation and paying its counsel,\nknowing  that  any  amounts  paid  to  counsel  would  be  considered  by  DMR  and  the  state  to  be  \"non-\nreimbursable\" and \"subject to recoupment.\"\n \n          260. This is a deliberate interference with the orderly administration of justice and constitutes further bad\nfaith. The fact that the bad faith and contemptuous conduct of DMR continues during the very course of this\ntrial indicates to this Court the DMR regards itself \"above the Law\", not bound by contractual obligations and\nanswerable to no one for its actions except itself.\n \n          261. DMR is the licensor for the single family group homes operated by JRC in southeastern\nMassachusetts for the JRC student's residences. In 1994, DMR changed its \"license\" for group homes to a\n\"certification\" and instituted a new survey tool to regulate and certify the homes which is termed \"QUEST\".\n \n          262. In November of 1994, DMR conducted a QUEST survey of JRC's group homes for purposes of\ndetermining whether or not the group homes should be certified and, therefore, approved for continued use as\ngroup homes for disabled individuals. Although the QUEST survey was conducted in November of 1994 and\nthe report was dated December 20 1994, DMR did not give JRC the QUEST report or any information about\nit until March 15, 1995. DMR gave JRC group homes a \"non-certification\". By letter dated April 10, 1995,\nDMR gave JRC ninety days to substantially correct the alleged deficiencies. (Exhibit 183).\n \n          263. The reasons given in the QUEST report for JRC's non-certification are arbitrary and capricious\nand ignore the severe physical and mental disabilities and needs of the JRC population.[65]\n-\nFootnote [65] For example, DMR faulted JRC staff for the affectionate and caring interaction with the students\nbecause \"they were not reflective of positive adult roles.\" (Exhibit 64, p. 1). DMR cited JRC as deficient in the\nQUEST report because it did not provide its students with keys to their homes. (Exhibit 64, p. 5). Dr. Israel\ntestified and this Court so finds that many of his clients would, due to their disabilities, probably swallow the\nhouse key if it were given to them. JRC was cited in the QUEST report as deficient for transporting the JRC\nstudents in a  school bus which the report  characterizes as \"stigmatizing\" and the  report requires JRC  to\npurchase passenger vehicles as a substitute for the school bus. (Exhibit 164 at p. 7). JRC was cited by DMR\nin the QUEST report as deficient because JRC does not seek out JRC's students' opinions on administrative\ndecisions, staff hiring and staff evaluations.\n-\n \n          264. The QUEST report also makes extremely positive findings about the quality of the JRC group\n\nhomes  and  staff,  which findings  stand  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  derogatory  certification  letters  issued  by\nCommissioner  Campbell and  the decision  in  the QUEST  Report  to give  the JRC  group  homes a  non-\ncertification.[66]\n-\nFootnotes [66] The extremely positive findings of the QUEST team included in the December 20, 1994\nQUEST Report state: \"Overall staff demonstrated a caring rapport with the students they served; generally,\npeople were supported to present a pleasant, attractive  appearance; the homes in the agency  were well\nmaintained and blended in with the neighborhood; the agency supported people to communicate with staff; all\nindividuals surveyed received general health services from JRC and the staff were knowledgeable about each\nindividuals medical concerns.\"\n-\n \n          265. On May 23, 1995, JRC requested mediation concerning JRC's non-certification by the QUEST\nteam. DMR never responded to this request for arbitration under ¶B-2 of the Settlement Agreement, and has\nnever given JRC any information on the status of its group home licenses since the 90-day grace period\nexpired on June 15, 1995.\n \n          266. DMR violated the Settlement Agreement by not certifying JRC's group homes for the reasons\ngiven  in  the  QUEST  report  and  by  allowing  JRC's  90-day  grace  period  to  lapse  without  any  written\nnotification as to the status of the group home licenses.  In addition, DMR violated ¶ B-2 of the Settlement\nAgreement by not responding to JRC's request for arbitration of the QUEST issue.\n \n          267.  The JRC program, which has an extremely vulnerable population, is the largest collection of\ndifficult to treat clients in one program in the nation.  The JRC students exhibit extremely self-injurious and\naggressive behaviors which have generally been resistant to  all forms of treatment prior to their admission to\nJRC. [67]\n-\nFootnote[67] The JRC students' self-injurious and aggressive behaviors include banging their heads to the\npoint of causing brain injury, pulling hair out to the point of baldness, rubbing skin to the point of bone infection,\nbreaking their own bones, rubbing off the side of their nose, biting off other people’s noses and eye poking to\nthe point of threatening dislodging of the retina and threatening blindness.\n-\nDue to the severity of behavior problems, the average JRC student had been rejected by five placements and\nexpelled by nine prior to coming to JRC.[68]\n\n-\nFootnote[68]  It is JRC's policy not to deny admission because a student has been difficult or impossible for\nothers to deal with in prior placements.  Therefore, JRC accepts many students no other provider would or\ncould accept due to behaviors dangerous to themselves and others.\n-\n \n          268.  As described infra, the Department's acts of contempt and other wrongful conduct, imposed a\nsevere and essentially constant burden on the JRC staff by having to respond to an unrelenting stream of bad\nfaith  regulatory  demands  and  other  bad  faith  conduct  over  twenty-two  months.    The  Department's\ncontemptuous conduct also caused a severe and almost constant drain on JRC's revenues by forcing JRC to\npay almost one million dollars in attorneys fees and other expenses to defend the school from the Department's\ncontemptuous conduct.  The Department has caused even greater financial damage to JRC by reducing JRC's\nenrollment by attacking JRC's reputation and competency,  which were directed to JRC's only  source of\nrevenue: its funding and placement agencies.  With ever increasing attorneys fees and dropping revenues, JRC\nhad no alternative but to cut staff and reduce purchases in order to maintain financial viability.  These cuts along\nwith the staffs' preoccupation responding to DMR's bad faith regulatory demands, adversely affected the\nquality of the most important aspect of JRC's program--the positive programming and educational components\nof the program.  While aversive therapies are the best known and most controversial aspect of treatment, it is\nin fact the positive rewards that are the most pervasive and important to the students.\n \n          269.  DMR caused grievous harm to the JRC students when its contemptuous and wrongful actions\nfinancially devastated the school and left JRC unable to provide the sophisticated reward and educational\naspects of the program.  It has been the JRC students that have suffered the most from DMR's conduct.\n \n          270.  JRC has also been greatly harmed by DMR's conduct.  DMR's publication of false and\ndefamatory  decisions and  other  correspondence has  caused  extensive damage  to  JRC's  reputation as  a\nreliable, effective and safe program for this nation's most afflicted individuals.  The damage to JRC's reputation\nand good will with its funding and placement agencies has caused JRC to suffer a loss of revenues of such\nmagnitude that its financial viability is in peril. \n \n          271.  As previously discussed, DMR's assault on JRC's program began with the August 6, 1993,\n\"Interim Certification\" Order.  (Exhibit 82).  Critical staff such as clinicians, case managers, and the Director of\nTreatment had to put aside their usual duties of providing care and treatment to the students and spend three\nweeks responding to Commissioner Campbell's regulatory demands.  The needless and wasteful condition that\nJRC respond in detail to Commissioner Campbell's August 6 Letter harmed the students and the program by\nconsuming the staff's attention during that period of time.\n \n\n          272.  After completing the response to the August 6 Letter, JRC researched the Rivendell group to\ndetermine the partiality and capability of this group.  The JRC students and the JRC program were harmed by\nJRC having to divert staff resources to conduct Rivendell research rather than provide care and treatment to\nthe students.\n \n          273.  The eight-person Rivendell team occupied the JRC facilities for the week of March 20 through\nMarch 25, 1994, looking at files and observing staff and students. \n \n          274.  The demands of the Rivendell team at JRC drew staff away from their normal duties in order to\nsubmit to interviews and respond to document demands made by the Rivendell team.  The Rivendell team also\nwithdrew students from classrooms and removed them from their normal daily activities in order to subject the\nstudents to interviews.\n \n          275.  The Rivendell Group, as previously discussed, was not an independent and unbiased review\nteam.  The review conducted by Rivendell was unnecessary and harmed JRC and its students by creating a\nchaotic state at the school for a one week period, bringing treatment to a near standstill to the great harm and\ndetriment of the JRC students and the program. \n \n          276.  From August of 1993 up to the time of trial, half of Dr. Israel's time, as well as half of the time of\nthe psychology staff, was devoted to dealing with the Department's regulatory activity.\n \n          277.  Dr. Israel also spent substantial amounts of time meeting with, corresponding with, and talking to\nJRC's out-of-state funding and placement agencies in an effort to convince them DMR would not be able to\nclose JRC, that students currently in the program should remain and referrals should continue to be made to the\nprogram.\n \n          278.  Dr. Israel was even more preoccupied in May and June of 1994 when the Department, after\nmonths of refusing to do so, finally agreed to negotiate modifications to the conditions of the February 9th\ncertification letter.\n \n          279.  From June of 1994 through December of 1994, almost all of the attention of two of JRC's full-\ntime clinicians, Drs. von Heyn and Worsham, who have a case load of sixteen students each, was diverted\naway from the students in order to respond to DMR's regulatory demands including the rewriting of fifty-two\nbehavior modification treatment plans that had been previously approved by this Court.  (Exhibit 152).  During\n\nthis period of time, the students were deprived of essential services provided by the JRC clinicians and case\nmanagers.  Furthermore, there was no therapeutic benefit to the students from the changes required by DMR\nin the treatment plan.\n \n          280.  Drs. von Heyn and Worsham were also required to respond, within thirty days to the fifty-six\nmedical  and forty-two  psychiatric evaluations  written by  the  psychiatrists and  physicians  retained by  the\nDepartment who examined all of the JRC students.\n \n          281 This Court finds that it was unnecessary, intrusive and highly unethical for the Department to have\nconducted medical and psychiatric evaluations on all JRC students without an analysis or even a regard to\nwhether any of these were clinically indicated.\n \n          282.  The Department had conducted only two abuse investigations in the 22-year history of JRC prior\nto July, 1993.  DMR conducted, initiated or referred more than fifty abuse investigations, between August 6,\n1993 and the time of trial. [69]\n-Footnote [69] In fact, the fifty-six medical evaluations (Exhibit 284) completed by DMR on all of the JRC\nstudents and JRC's responses thereto (Exhibit 287) establish unequivocally that the JRC students as a group\nare healthy, well-nourished, receiving excellent care with no signs of abuse or mistreatment.\n-\n \n          283.  It was also unnecessary and detrimental to the JRC students and the JRC program when DMR\nrequired  the  JRC  staff  to  undergo  training,  including  behavior  modification  training,  conducted  by  the\nDepartment during the summer and fall of 1994.\n \n          284.  The behavior modification training did not provide the JRC staff with anything new and useful\nbeyond the job training already received at JRC.  This training caused further harm to the students since it took\nplace during the same period of time that the JRC staff was preoccupied with medical examinations, psychiatric\nexaminations, rewriting  treatment plans and responding to other regulatory demands of the Department.  As a\nresult, large groups of staff had to be removed from their normal program responsibilities to attend these\nsessions leaving the students with substantially less staff attention.\n \n          285.  From late October through the end of December 1994, JRC was besieged with visits from DMR\nemployees.[70]  All of these DMR agents and employees were  placing demands upon the  JRC staff to\nrespond to requests for information, interviews and other demands which left the JRC staff unable to attend to\n\nthe  JRC  students  depriving  them  of  the  treatment,  education,  rewards  and  attention  they  needed  and\ndeserved.  From August of 1993 to December of 1994 there were over 400 visits to JRC by DMR agents\nand employees.\n-\nFootnote [70] Including:  the DMR psychologist reviewing the six plans; DMR investigators; tandem service\ncoordinators;  the  QUEST  review  team;  the  psychiatrists  conduction  psychiatric  evaluations;  and  DMR\nattorneys reviewing records for substituted judgment actions.\n-     \n \n          286.  This Court finds that the JRC program would not have survived to this point if it had not hired\nattorneys to respond to the onslaught of regulatory activity which began on August 6, 1993 and continued to\nthe time of this contempt trial.  JRC reasonably and necessarily incurred $1,098,087.50 in attorneys' fee\nthrough July of 1995 in responding to DMR's regulatory demands and prosecuting this contempt action.\n \n          287.  These attorney fees were not in JRC's budget and, prior to August of 1993, JRC had never\nbefore incurred attorneys' fees in this magnitude in order to respond to the regulatory activities of DMR. \n(DMR's certification process, which took place in 1988 and 1989, was  conducted and resolved without the\nneed for significant attorney involvement.)\n \n          288.  In order to pay the attorneys fees incurred after July of 1993, cuts in the program had to be made,\nand since three-quarters of JRC's budget is staff salary, cuts had to be made to staff.[71]  The staff cuts\ndeteriorated the staff-to-student ratio in all departments, reducing the overall quality of the program.\n -\nFootnote[71] In fiscal 1994 (July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1994), the Department's wrongful conduct caused JRC\nto reduce its staff by thirty percent as compared with fiscal year 1993.  From the end of fiscal year 1993 to the\nend of fiscal year 1995, JRC was forced to reduce its staff by fifty percent in order to pay the attorneys fees\nnecessary to respond to the Department's wrongful and contemptuous conduct.  The staff cuts also included\nreductions in direct-care staff.\n-\n \n          289. By the end of fiscal year 1995, student enrollment was down thirty percent when compared to the\nend of fiscal year 1993.  The thirty percent drop in enrollment reduced JRC's revenues by approximately $3\nmillion, causing further harm to the JRC students and the program through a lack of funds to maintain staffing\nand purchases to care and treat the students.[72]\n\n-\n Footnote [72]-The drop in revenue caused by the drop in enrollment of students, as well as the need to pay\nattorneys fees, caused the school: to have insufficient funds for outside consultants to improve the treatment\nprograms; to eliminate the case manager position for a period of time and place that burden on the JRC\nclinician, to increase case manager case load by fifty percent when the position was re-instated; to eliminate the\nposition of Quality Control Monitors; to lay off one part-time clinician; and to suspend the staff evaluation\nprocess.  These effects from DMR's wrongful and contemptuous conduct have caused a substantial reduction\nin the quality of the JRC program to the great harm and detriment to the JRC students, and have greatly\nreduced the morale of the JRC staff causing further harm to the students.\n-\n \n          290.  From 1987 to August of 1993, JRC's enrollment grew from 43 to 66.  After DMR began\npublishing its stream of false and defamatory communications and certification decisions, the growing trend in\nJRC's enrollment changed to a decreasing trend and JRC's enrollment decreased from 66 in August of 1993 to\n43 at the time of trial.  In August of 1993 the referrals of new clients to JRC from JRC's largest client, the State\nof New York, dropped dramatically, and an important placement agency in New York City on two occasions\nstopped all referrals to JRC.  The Department's regulatory decisions and other correspondence sent to JRC's\nfunding and placement agencies [73] harmed JRC's reputation and goodwill with its funding and placement\nagencies which resulted in a reduction of JRC's enrollment by thirty percent, reduction in referrals and a loss in\nrevenue which has significantly lessened the quality of the JRC program, all to the great harm and detriment of\nJRC and the students.\n-\nFootnote [73] Two glaring examples include: the condition in the August 31st certification letter requiring JRC\nto have emergency plans in place for each student which damaged JRC’s ability to retain and attract clients,\nand the December 15th certification letter which cast JRC in a false light as a program that fails to report\ndeaths to its licensing agency and as not being trustworthy or competent to accept and care for disabled\nindividuals.\n \n          291.  DMR's contemptuous conduct has damaged the educational component of JRC's program.  Due\nto the staff reductions, the teachers are managing large groups of students instead of providing more of the\none-to-one teaching that occurred prior to August of 1993 and is necessary to teach new skills to JRC's\ndisabled clientele.  JRC has been forced to suspend its precision teaching systems because there is not enough\nstaff to chart performance.\n \n          292.  In addition, JRC does not have the fiscal resources to be able to maintain the reward  program at\nits pre-August 1993 level.  DMR's conduct has caused grievous harm to the JRC students by draining the\nfunds from the school that  were previously available and used to  fund the JRC students'  most desirable\n\nawards.  For example, the students used to earn trips with preferred staff off campus when passing a two to\nthree day contract for not  engaging in behavior such as self-abuse.  The JRC students and the program have\nbeen  harmed  because  the  program  is  now  less  capable  of  motivating  the  students  through  positive\nprogramming.  The result is that current treatment of the students is not as effective.\n \n          293. There are currently not enough staff at JRC to bring the students into the community for education\nsuch as making transaction at banks, purchases at malls, and other community involvement.  Even the students\ninvolvement in the Special Olympics has been significantly reduced.\n \n          294.  The Department's contemptuous conduct has also placed the JRC students and staff at risk for\nmore  injuries  due to  low  staffing.   The  dropping  student  enrollment  has  caused the  more  qualified  and\nmarketable staff to leave JRC, out of fear it will be closing and that they will be left without a job.  The result is\na  less skillful  and quality  staff available  to respond  to a  crisis (such  as student  tantrums and  aggressive\noutbursts) and maintain the care and safety of other students during a crisis.\n \n          295.  The Department's contemptuous conduct has caused a deterioration in the quality of life for the\nJRC students.  The students do not have the opportunity to travel home to visit their families as they did prior\nto August of 1993, because there is not sufficient staff available to bring the students home for visits.  The\nstudents are spending less time at the JRC group home residence and more time at the school building in\nProvidence, Rhode Island, because it is safer, due to low staffing levels, for the students to be in one building\ncloser to all of the staff than to disperse staff and students amount the group homes.\n \n          296.  The actions of DMR to discredit Dr. Daignault's professional competency and credibility have\naffected his ability to perform his duties under the Settlement Agreement.\n \n          297.  As a result, students of JRC were deprived of the prior existing benefit of a collegial and\nproductive relationship between the Court Monitor and DMR, which had in the past resulted in comprehensive\ntreatment information being brought to the attention of the Court, and resolution of licensing issues in a manner\nwhich served the best interests of the students.\n \n          298.  DMR's refusal to allow JRC to continue the Specialized Food Program has made JRC's program\nless effective  in treating  behavior disorders.   This  decision has  critically impacted  two students  who are\ncurrently suffering a dramatic increase in their health-dangerous behaviors.  J.C. is now engaging in more self-\nabuse  and  receiving more  applications  of  contingent  electric  shock, where  before  the  Specialized  Food\nProgram had successfully suppressed those behaviors through the student's love of food.  DMR is directly\nresponsible for the recent regression of this student and the increased shocks she is receiving.\n\n \n          299.  The Court heard testimony on damages from Arthur Mullen who is a certified public accountant\nand a principal in the accounting firm of Mullen, Scorpio and Cerilli located in Providence, Rhode Island.  This\nfirm has been JRC's accountant for approximately 22 years.  Mr. Mullen is responsible for auditing JRC, as\nwell as preparing certain financial reports.  The firm  has a specialty in not-for-profit organizations  and a\nfamiliarity with regulations, and the practices and procedures of the DPS.\n \n          300.  In August of 1993, JRC's financial condition was relatively strong.  JRC had a surplus, which is\nthe accumulation of profits over time, in the amount of $585,000, and annual revenues of approximately $10.4\nmillion.  JRC's surplus is extremely important, because surplus is a factor that JRC's lender, Fleet National\nBank, relies on in order to grant JRC access to credit.  JRC's access to its line of credit is essential for\nmaintaining its staff and serving its students.  Without it, JRC would be unable to meet ongoing payroll needs.\n \n          301.  JRC's financial condition as of June 30, 1995 was substantially down.  Total revenue were down\nto $8.7 million from $10.4 million in June of 1993.  Moreover, the number of students has dropped from 66 to\n43.  JRC has had to adjust to the drop in revenue by restructuring, which means JRC had to reduce expenses. \nFor a non-profit organization like JRC, that mean cutting staff.\n \n          302.  Even with lower staffing costs, JRC's loss for fiscal year 1995 is expected to be $50,000,\ndropping the surplus down to approximately $520,000.  Assuming that the census of 43 students stays stable\nfor fiscal year 1996, projected revenues will be $7.3 million, which is approximately $3 million less than the\n1993 revenues.  This will necessitate further cost cutbacks and even further reductions of staff.\n \n          303.  Total legal fees incurred by JRC, the parents and the class of students as a result of this litigation,\nwhich were necessary and reasonable in response to the wrongful conduct of DMR, are 1,098,087.50.\n \n          303.  The only way for JRC to pay these legal fees is to continue to reduce costs and lay off staff. \nMoney can not be taken out of the surplus, because the surplus would be wiped out, which would constitute a\ndefault on JRC's loan agreements and terminate JRC's lending arrangements which would result in JRC's\ninability to fund payroll.\n \n \n                                      COROLLARY FINDINGS\n\n                   IMPROPER CONDUCT BY DMR AND ITS ATTORNEYS\n \n          1.  These findings are contained in a separate section in order to set forth the Contempt Findings in as\nstraight forward a manner as possible.  The fact that there is a separate section devoted to the improper\nconduct of attorneys should in no way diminish the significance of these Findings.\n \n          2.  The Court is very disturbed by the conduct of counsel for DMR, and it is with great regret and\ndisappointment that reference must be made to them.\n \n          3.  One of the strategies undertaken by the Department was to inappropriately waste judicial and\nfinancial resources in an effort to exploit JRC's deteriorating financial resources in an effort to exploit JRC's\ndeteriorating financial situation.  This Court takes judicial notice of the conduct of the Department in the\nsubstituted judgment treatment plan review for JRC client, B.S.[74]\n-\nFootnote [74] See In Re:  B.S., Docket No. 89P1073-GI, decided February 10, 1995.  This case involved a\ntreatment plan review conducted over a period of five days, commencing October 31, 1994  and concluding\non December 21, 1994.  In his decision of February 10, 1995, Judge Jones of this Court found that the\nconduct  of  the  Department  of  Mental  Retardation  in  that  proceeding  was  improper  and  resulted  in  an\nunnecessarily  prolonged  proceeding.    The  Court  also  made  particular  note  of  its  awareness  of  these\nproceedings,  and  stated  that  the  Court  was  \"concerned  that  Brandon's  interests  may  have  been  made\nsecondary by DMR to this ongoing dispute.\" (Decision, p. 19).\n-\n \n          4.  This Court also takes judicial notice of the Memorandum of Judge Jones of March 23, 1995 in\nresponse to DMR’S Motion For Reconsideration.[75]\n-\nFootnote [75] In the Memorandum, Judge Jones found that DMR was in violation of ¶B-2 of the Settlement\nAgreement, and also found that the Department could not by implementation of its certification process subvert\nthe  provisions  of the  Settlement  Agreement  and also  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  to  render  substituted\njudgment determinations on a case-by-case basis.  (Decision, p. 1-2)\n-\nBy that time the Commissioner had issued his letter of January 20, 1995, which decision ordered JRC to stop\nutilizing procedures approved by substituted judgment orders of this Court.\n\n \n          5.  The Court finds that the conduct of Department's attorneys in this case was consistent with the\nfindings of Judge Jones in the B.S. decision concerning the conduct of DMR counsel.\n \n          6.  There were a number of attorneys who appeared on behalf of DMR.  Many have been involved in\nthis litigation since its inception, (e.g. General Counsel Kim Murdock and Assistant General Counsel Margaret\nChow-Menzer.)\n \n          7.  On September 22, 1993, General Counsel Kim Murdock, Esq. filed a document which she\ncharacterized as a report to the Court.  This report, which has been previously summarized, contained blatant\nfalse statements, and omitted material information.\n \n          8.  On the first day of trial, June 26, 1995, this Court requested that an explanation be provided to the\nCourt concerning the false statements and mischaracterizations which appeared in that Report to the Court. \nNo credible explanation was advanced, and the individual who prepared the Report and submitted it to this\nCourt, General Counsel Kim Murdock, did not present herself to testify in these proceedings.\n \n          9.  DR 7-102(A)(5) as appearing in 382 Mass 784 (1981) precludes counsel from knowingly making a\nfalse statement of law or fact to a tribunal.  In addition, DR1-102(A)(4)(5) as appearing in 382 Mass. 769-\n770  (1981)  provides  that  a  lawyer  shall  not  engage  in  conduct  involving  dishonesty,  fraud,  deceit  and\nmisrepresentation, or in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice.  See also In the Matter of\nMcCarthy, 416 Mass. 423 (1993).  In this case, the September 22, 1993 Report to the Court was filed by\nGeneral Counsel Kim Murdock.  Attorney Murdock knew of the two Casey Team Certification Reports of\n1991 and 1993 in so far  as they were addressed  to her.  As previously  discussed, these reports  were\nfavorable to JRC and recommended certification.  Despite the fact that Attorney Murdock had attached\nseveral exhibits to her report, the two Casey Certification Team Reports were deliberately withheld from the\nCourt.  This Court therefore concludes that when General Counsel Murdock presented this report to the Court\nshe provided the Court with a document that she knew contained false statements and which omitted material\nfacts which were necessary to give the Court a full and accurate picture of the matters that were allegedly being\ndescribed.\n \n          10.  There were numerous documents which were marked as exhibits which demonstrated the falsity of\nthe Commissioner's testimony.  These exhibits were in the possession of DMR counsel and known by DMR\ncounsel.\n \n\n          11.  When a client testifies falsely under oath, counsel has an obligation to insure that a fraud is not\nperpetrated  upon  a  tribunal.    See  DR  7-102  (A)(4)  and  (B)(1).    As  found  in  the  findings,  some  of\nCommissioner Campbell's testimony was deliberately false.  At certain points, counsel for DMR, knowing the\ntestimony was false, had the opportunity to correct the information given to the Court but failed to do so.\n \n          12.  Not only did DMR counsel fail to correct false testimony, DMR counsel elicited false testimony. \nBy introducing documents containing false information into court, by filing a report to the Court that contained\nfalse information and by failing to correct the record when they had the opportunity to do so, the Department's\nattorneys perpetrated a fraud on a tribunal.  As McCarthy makes clear, and effective judicial system depends\non the honesty and integrity of the lawyers who appear before its tribunals.  A fraud on the Court is a \"wrong\nagainst  the  institutions  set  up  to  protect  and  safeguard  the  public,  institutions  in  which  fraud  cannot\ncomplacently be tolerated consistently with the good order of society.\"  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-\nEmpire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 246 (1944).\n \n          13.  Assistant Attorney General Yogman compounds said false testimony by endorsing and submitting it\nto this Court in DMR's proposed findings of fact.  Said proposed findings of fact totally misrepresent the 13\nday trial and present a proposed factual picture that was totally contradicted by the evidence.  The Court was\nshocked during trial by Attorney Yogman's conduct, but allowed that she may have had a difficult client and\nmay have been consumed by the heat of trial.  This allowance was dispelled by the receipt of patently false\nproposed findings of fact that were filed ten days after the conclusion of trial, with more than sufficient time for\ncareful reflection.\n \n          14.  When exhibits relating to the Tuesday Morning Meetings were first presented to this Court on the\nfirst day of trial, there were numerous \"redactions\" which had been undertaken by DMR counsel with respect\nto particular topics disused at those meetings which, according to DMR Counsel, were based upon DMR's\nattorney/client privilege.\n \n          15.  In response to JRC's request, DMR was ordered to produce unredacted documents.  Attorney\nYogman represented that the unredacted documents would be produced on the following day.  They were not\nproduced on that day.  On July 7, 1993, DMR produced a number of additional documents which deleted\nsome but not all of the \"redactions\" which had appeared in the original documents.  DMR was then ordered for\na second time to produce fully redacted documents which DMR did on July 11th.  (Exhibits 293-304).  Even\non that date, however,  DMR had not fully complied with the Court's  order, and subsequent unredacted\ndocuments were produced on July 12, 1993. (Exhibit 322).\n \n          16.  DMR's counsel acted with intransigence and defiance with respect to the Court's orders to produce\nthese documents.  Moreover, much of the information for which the attorney-client privilege was originally\n\ninvoked in support of these 'redactions\" was done so without any basis in fact or in law.\n \n          17.  In sum, therefore, DMR's counsel not only failed to comply with the Court's Order concerning the\nproduction of these documents in the unredacted form but also made the decision to redact information which\nwas plainly  not protected  by the  attorney-client  privilege in  a transparent  effort  to  prevent discovery  of\ndocuments which were harmful to the Defendant's case.  DMR counsel's disregard for an order of this Court\nand  its  frivolous  invocation  of  the  attorney-client  privilege  to  protect  information  which  DMR's  lawyers\nconsidered to be damaging to their case will not be tolerated by this Court.  This Court concludes that DMR's\ncounsel willfully violated orders of this Court.\n \n          18.  In its Pre-trial Memorandum, DMR listed more than 140 individual witnesses in this proceeding. \nYet, the Department called only six witnesses.  (Commissioner Campbell was called by the Plaintiffs.  He was\noriginally on the Department's list).\n \n          19.  The listing of more than 140 witnesses contributed to the incursion of unnecessary legal expense by\nthe Plaintiffs in their preparation of this case.  The Court concludes  that the listing with such a large number of\nwitnesses was a purposeful attempt to cause the plaintiffs to incur unnecessary legal expenses in an effort to\ndelay and frustrate this proceeding.\n \n          20.  The Court also concludes that DMR has undertaken retaliatory action against Court officials.  For\nexample, the Findings discuss DMR action against Court Monitor Dr. Daignault and Attorney Bettine Briggs,\nGAL. This Court concludes that these actions were undertaken with the participation of DMR's attorneys in an\neffort to intimidate and harass officials of this Court.\n \n          21.  The misrepresentations of DMR's lawyers were not confined to the courtroom.  For example,\nAttorney Margaret Chow-Menzer misrepresented to counsel for JRC that a document which was sent to them\nfor the plaintiffs was the response of Rivendell to the RFP.  In fact, however, the document was not Rivendell's\nresponse to the RFP but one which had been prepared by Rivendell after Rivendell's bid had been accepted.\n \n          22.  This Court found most of DMR's witnesses not to be credible, and the Court felt the need on\nnumerous occasions, after repeated instances of contradictory sworn testimony, to remind witnesses that they\nwere under oath and had to tell the truth.[76]\n-\nFootnote[76] One notable exception was Attorney George Casey whose testimony this Court found to be\n\ncredible.\n-\n \n          23.  The sophistry of the Department's counsel was also exemplified on the first day of the trial when in\nher opening statement, Assistant Attorney General Yogman indicated that the Department had no obligation\nunder the Settlement Agreement to act in good faith.  This Court is appalled that a senior member of the Office\nof the Attorney General, representing an agency which is supposed to serve the people of the Commonwealth\ncould seriously contend that there was no obligation for her client to act in good faith.  Attorney Yogman's\nremarks  were  representative  of  the  manner  in  which  the  Department  and  its  counsel  conducted  these\nproceedings as well as their lack of respect for the judicial process.\n \n          24.  This Court specifically finds that counsel for DMR failed, in a number of different areas, to comply\nwith the standards expected of attorneys practicing before this Court.  This Court concludes that the conduct\nof counsel unnecessarily prolonged these proceedings.\n \n          25.  For the reasons stated herein, copies of these Findings have been forwarded to the Board of Bar\nOverseers.\n \nDate: Oct. 6, 1995                     Hon. Elizabeth O'Neil LaStaiti\n ",

R. CIV. P. 60(b)(5) TO VACATE CONSENT DECREE  \nOver 25 years ago, the Director of the fanner Office for Children (\"OFC\") issued a series \nof emergency orders and took other actions designed to suspend, without hearing, the license of \nJRC, a residential facility in Canton that provides services to individuals with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities. After JRC filed this lawsuit challenging the Director's actions, the \n1 \nWhen the complaint was filed, the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center was known as the \nBehavior Research Institute. Second Am. Compl. (May 27, 1986) (\"Compl.\") at 1 (attached as \nExh. 1 to Affidavit of Yolanda Hales (\"Hales Aff.\"), which is attached as Exh. A). For \nconvenience, this memorandum will refer to the facility exclusively as \"JRC.\" The other \nplaintiffs were Dr. Matthew L. Israel, JRC's Executive Director; Leo Soucy, individually and as \nparent and next friend of Brendon Soucy; Peter Biscardi, individually and as parent and next \nfriend of P.J. Biscardi; and a class of all parents and guardians of students at JRC, on behalf of \nthemselves, their children, and wards. Id. \n2  The original defendant was Mary Kay Leonard, the Director of the fanner Office for Children. \nCompl. at 1. The agencies currently bound by the consent decree are the Department of \nDevelopmental Services (\"DDS\") and the Department of Early Education and Care (\"DEEC\"). \nDDS is successor to the Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR\"), which in 1988 assumed \nthe obligations under the decree previously assigned to the Department of Mental Health \n(\"DMH\").  Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr. v. Comm'r of Dep't of Mental Retardation,  424 Mass. \n430,-432 n.3 (1997) (\"JRC\"). DEEC is successor to the Office for Children, renamed the Office \nof Child Care Services in 1997.  See  G.L. c. 15D, § 2 (2012); G.L. c. 28A § 3 (2007). \n\nparties entered into a settlement agreement, which became a consent decree after it was \nincorporated as an order of this Court in January 1987. The plain language of the agreement \ncontemplated termination within approximately one year, but in 1988 this Court extended the \nagreement because, at the time, JRC was not fully licensed. JRC has long since been operating \nwith a full license, but the consent decree has remained in place to this date. \nToday, over 25 years after the decree was entered, significant changes in circumstances \nhave come to pass that warrant vacatur of the decree because prospective application \"is no \nlonger equitable.\" Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). First, both the teens of the decree and the current \nfacts demonstrate that the purpose of the decree was long ago achieved. The plain intent of the \nparties was that the decree would teiminate after approximately one year—i.e., the time \nnecessary to remedy JRC for OFC's past bad acts. The defendant agencies have already \ncomplied with the decree for a much longer period than the parties intended, including ten years \nduring which DMR was under receivership. It has now been over six years since the \nreceivership was terminated, and, since that time, the defendants have continued to fulfill their \nobligations under the decree both by complying with its tern's and exercising regulatory \nauthority over JRC with fairness and transparency. Vacatur of the decree is thus not only \nequitable, it is required under the doctrine of separation of powers, which prohibits a court from \nenforcing a judgment concerning the exercise of executive functions absent evidence that the \nagency has refused to comply with the judgment or has broadly abrogated its statutory duties. \nThat doctrine has particular force here because the decree has for some time granted JRC \nremedies not available to any other provider in the Commonwealth. \nSecond, current clinical and empirical evidence, which was not available when the decree \nwas entered, reflects an overwhelming professional consensus that the aversive, punitive \ninterventions now used by JRC—primarily, contingent electric skin shock (cid:9) do not conform to \nthe accepted standard of care for treatment of individuals with intellectual and developmental \ndisability. This change in the standard of care, which DDS has recently incorporated in its \n2 \n\nregulations to apply on a prospective basis, is in inherent conflict with JRC's position that the \ndecree affiimatively authorizes those procedures and that DDS has no authority to regulate their \nuse. JRC's position, and its related claim that it is entitled to arbitrate any disputes with DDS \nbefore a court monitor, have hampered DDS's efforts to ensure that JRC is complying with the \naccepted standard of practice in the field of behavioral treatment. Continued enforcement of the \ndecree would therefore be contrary to the public interest, warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(5). \nFor these reasons and those below, the decree should be vacated in its entirety. \nBACKGROUND3  \nI.  THE UNDERLYING COMPLAINT AND DECREE \nA. (cid:9) The Allegations of the Complaint \nJRC filed this action in 1986 seeking injunctive relief based on a series of events that \noccurred over the course of approximately seven months the previous year. In particular, JRC \nclaimed that OFC, through its Director, had engaged in bad-faith regulatory and licensing \nactivities in an attempt to prevent JRC from using \"professionally appropriate\" aversive \ninterventions4  on its students. Compl. ¶ 86. At the time the aversive techniques being used by \nJRC consisted of water sprays, taste aversives, and muscle squeezes, in conjunction with \nmechanical restraints. Id. ¶ 16. JRC used these techniques \"in lieu of anti-psychotic medication \nand other more restrictive procedures such as seclusion and electroshock.\" Id. \nIn early to mid-1985, an OFC employee conducted a licensing restudy of JRC and \nconcluded that its techniques were clinically appropriate and conformed to the standards \nrecommended by professionals in the field. Id. 11117, 23-24. Despite this conclusion, a few \nmonths later, OFC's Director sent JRC a \"Notice of Emergency Suspension\" and an \"Order to \n These facts are derived from court documents or from the attached affidavits, which are signed \n3 \nunder the penalties of perjury, in compliance with Probate Court Standing Order 2-99. \n4  An aversive intervention is a \"procedure[] involving things or events that, when presented \ncontingent upon some specified target behavior(s), have a decelerating effect upon that \nbehavior.\" 115 C.M.R. 5.14(2). \n3 \n\nShow Cause,\" mandating that JRC \"'cease all group care or be subject to prosecution.' \" Id \n26. The Director also sent an \"Emergency Order to Correct. Deficiencies\" requiring JRC to \n\"cease the use of any physical aversives, cease the use of all contingent food programs, and cease \nintake of new students.\" Id. ¶ 27. OFC took these actions without giving JRC notice or an \nopportunity to make alternative arrangements for treatment. Id. Further, OFC did not offer any \n\"medical, psychological or psychiatric evidence\" suggesting the existence of an emergency or of \n\"alternative procedures or placements\" that would serve the needs of the students. Id.  lit 38-39. \nJRC immediately appealed the emergency suspension to the Division of Administrative \nLaw Appeals (\"DALA\"), which found that, contrary to OFC' s determination, there was no \nemergency and that JRC's license should remain active pending a hearing on the merits. Id. \n¶ 42. Shortly thereafter, in December 1985, the parties entered into an Interim Agreement in \nwhich they agreed to stay the DALA proceedings so that JRC could apply for variances with \nOFC. Id. ¶ 51. OFC failed to comply with the Interim Agreement in several respects, including \nby assembling what JRC believed to be a biased panel of individuals to review JRC's variance \nrequests. Id_ rif 53-62. OFC also asserted that JRC could not appeal that portion of its order \nbarring intake of new students, and it refused to participate in the DALA hearing that was \nconvened for that purpose. Id. TIT 82-83. \nIn March 1986 the parties entered into another agreement, which provided for a team to \nbe assembled to evaluate the treatment plans for 18 of the most handicapped students then \nenrolled at JRC. Id. ¶ 65. The parties agreed that the team would have full authority to design \nplans for those students and that its authority would not be affected by any decision made on \nJRC's variance requests. Id. 111167-68, 73. The team proceeded to issue plans that included a \ncontingent-food program, physical aversives, and an automatic vapor-spray feature.  Id. 1170. \nTwo days later, however, the Director denied JRC's variance applications and, contrary to the \nplans designed by the team, banned the use of contingent-food programs, physical aversives, \nwater-vapor aversives, helmets, and taste aversives. Id.  TT 74-78. The Director also barred JRC \n4 \n\nfrom resuming intake of new students and made JRC's relicensing contingent on its agreement to \nradically change its approach to treatment. Id. ¶¶ 80-81. Moreover, before affording JRC a \nhearing on the license suspension, OFC contacted state and local educational agencies, stating \nthat JRC would close and urging them to withdraw their students. Id.  IN 91-92. \nAccording to JRC all of these alleged acts showed that OFC \"ha[d] abandoned its proper \nmonitoring and licensing review of [JRC].\" Id. ¶ 86. JRC asserted that the then Director, in \nparticular, \"ha[d] demonstrated through her actions that she [was] completely incapable of fairly \nand impartially exercising monitoring, regulatory and licensing functions or acting in the best \ninterests of [JRC] students.\" Id. ¶ 99. \nB. (cid:9) The Class and Claims \nBased on the above allegations, JRC and the parents of two students sought equitable \nrelief on behalf of a class of the approximately 60 students then attending JRC, their parents, and \ntheir guardians.  Id.  ¶ 7. The proposed class did not include future students. Id. \nThe complaint raised eight claims, three of which pertained to JRC. Those three claims \ndid not assert any ongoing wrong but, rather, sought relief solely to remedy OFC' s especially, \nthe Director's—past conduct: \n•  Count IV alleged that OFC violated JRC's and the class plaintiffs' due-process rights \nunder the Declaration of Rights, Articles X and XII, when it \"engaged in a series of \nactions which [were] arbitrary, irrational and unrelated to any legitimate state purpose\" \nand \"outside of [OFC's] statutory mandate,\" id. TIT 112-14; \n•  Count VII alleged that the Director violated JRC's rights under the Civil Rights Act, G.L. \nc. 12, §§ 11H, 111, by depriving JRC of due process through threats, coercion, and \nITT \nintimidation, id.  117-18; and \n®  Count VIII alleged that OFC violated the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. c. 30A, \nbecause the Director's various orders were not based on substantial evidence and because \nOFC failed to provide for an adjudicatory hearing for JRC to contest the closure of intake \nof new students, id. Irlf 123-27. \nThe remaining five claims, brought on behalf of the class plaintiffs only, likewise sought \nrelief based on the discrete, past acts of OFC and the Director: \n5 \n\n•  Count I alleged that \"OFC's Emergency Order to Correct Deficiencies and other OFC \nactions\" interfered with the students' rights under the Declaration of Rights, Articles X, \nXI and XII, to \"habilitation and a 'right not to regress as a result of state action,' \" id. \n101-05; \n•  Count II alleged that OFC interfered with the students' rights under G.L. c. 71B, §§ 1, et \nseq.,  to educational services designed to ensure their \"'maximum possible \ndevelopment,'\" id. If'f{ 106-08; \n•  Count III alleged that, \"[a]s a result of [OFC's] actions,\" the students \"have not been \nassured the sound and coordinated development of services\" and the parents \"have not \nbeen able to play a decisive role in the planning, operation and evaluation of programs for \nTit \nthe care of their children,\" in violation of former G.L. c. 28A, § 1, 5  id.  109-11; and \n•  Counts V and VI alleged that the Director violated the parents' and students' respective \nIN \nrights under the state Civil Rights Act, id.  115-18. \nC. (cid:9) The Consent Decree and Extension Order \nIn June 1986 this Court (Rotenberg, J.) entered a preliminary injunction barring \nenforcement of OFC's orders, finding that \"the director of OFC had engaged in bad faith \nregulation of JRC, and that her termination of JRC's treatment procedures was without medical \nsupport.\"  JRC,  424 Mass. at 433. A few months later, the parties entered into a settlement \nagreement, which the judge approved on January 7, 1987, and incorporated as an order of the \nCourt. Id. at 433-34. \nThe agreement's core provision, Part A, provides that \"aversive procedures are permitted \nfor use at [JRC] only when authorized as part of a court-ordered 'substituted judgment' treatment \nplan for an individual client.\" Settlement Agreement & Order (attached as Exh. 2 to Hales Aff.) \n(\"Decree\") at 2; see  id. at 3-6. Part B provides in turn that, \"[o]n each occasion when the Court \nissues a substituted judgment treatment plan, the Court shall also appoint a monitor who will \nreport to the Court.\" Id. at 6. The monitor is not only empowered to oversee issues regarding \nindividual plans, but also has general authority to oversee JRC's \"treatment and educational \nprogram[s].\" Id. at 7. In addition, if any disputes arise under the agreement, the parties must \nbring them to the monitor for arbitration. Id. \n5 Now incorporated in G.L. c. 15D, § 3. \n6 \n\nBy its terms the agreement was \"made for this case only,\" and the \"sole intent of each \nparty\" was \"simply to resolve this case and the other administrative and judicial cases which \n[were then] pending between O.F.C., [JRC] and the parents.\" Id. at 2. Consistent with this \nlimited intent, Part K of the agreement provides for termination after approximately one year: \nThe Probate Court shall conduct a hearing at six-month intervals in order to review the \nparties' adherence to the provisions of this, agreement. This agreement shall be \nautomatically extended at the first six month review unless the Court, upon motion by \nany party, orders otherwise.  This agreement shall automatically teilninate at the second \nreview  unless the Court, for good cause shown related to the teens or substance of this \nagreement, orders otherwise. \nId. at 13-14, Part K (emphasis added). Likewise, the agreement provides that the ten\" of the \ncourt monitor \"shall be for a period of six months unless extended by the Court in accordance \nwith the provisions of Paragraph K.\" Id. at 7. \nIn July 1988, after the second six-month review, this Court (Rotenberg, J.) extended the \nagreement \"until . . . further order.\" Order (July 7, 1988) (attached as Exh. 3 to Hales Aff.);  see  \nJRC,  424 Mass. at 434 n.6. The sole reason for the extension was that, at the time of the hearing, \nJRC was \"not fully licensed.\" Order (July 7, 1988). \nIL THE CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS AND RECEIVERSHIP \nIn the mid-1990s, JRC brought a contempt action against DMR claiming that it had \nviolated the consent decree by refusing in bad faith to grant JRC's request for recertification to \nuse \"Level (cid:9) aversive interventions.6  JRC,  424 Mass. at 432, 434. Among other things JRC \n Under previous and current regulations, \"[n]o Behavior Modification plans employing Level \n6 \nIII Interventions may be implemented except in a program or a distinct part of a program that . . . \nis . . . specially certified by the Department as having authority to administer such treatment.\" \n115 C.M.R. 5.14(4)(f); JRC,  424 Mass. at 434 n.8. A \"Level HP intervention is defined as \n\"[a]ny Intervention which involves the contingent application of physical contact aversive \nstimuli,\" \"Time Out wherein an individual is placed in a room alone for a period of time \nexceeding 15 minutes,\" \"[a]ny intervention not listed . . as a Level I or Level II Intervention \nwhich is highly intrusive and/or highly restrictive of freedom of movement,\" or \"[a]ny \nIntervention which alone, in combination with other Interventions, or as a result of multiple \napplications of the same Intervention poses a significant risk of physical or psychological harm \nto the individual.\" 115 C.M.R. 5.14(3)(d); JRC,  424 Mass. at 434 n.8. \n7 \n\nalleged that DMR (cid:9) acting under the direction of its then Commissioner—had refused to arbitrate \ndisputes as required by the decree, attempted to disrupt JRC's relationships with funding \nagencies and clients, and directly contradicted outstanding court orders by conditioning JRC's \nrecertification on its agreement to stop using certain aversive procedures. Id. at 436-42. \nThis Court (LaStaiti, J.) found DMR in contempt and, as a result, issued an order \nincorporating the consent decree and appointing a receiver to manage the agency in all of its \nrelationships with JRC. Id. at 463.7  The receivership was in place from 1996 to April 2006, \nduring which time DMR fully cooperated with the receiver in issuing licenses and certifications \nto JRC. Affidavit of Elin M. Howe (\"Howe Aff.\") (attached as Exh. B)  ¶1118, 33, 61-68. This \nincluded JRC's Level III aversive-intervention program, which was certified several times after \nreview by various DMR Level III certification teams. Id.  TT 63-68. In addition, DMR's \ncommissioner and senior staff met quarterly with the receiver and JRC representatives to resolve \nany disputes concerning JRC's programs. Id.  ¶ 18. \nIn 2003, based on DMR's compliance with the receivership order, the receiver submitted \na report opining that \"the relief ordered by the Judgment and Order ha[d] been accomplished.\" \nSpecial Report of Receiver re Plan for Winding Down the Receivership (May 19, 2003) \n(attached as Exh. 4 to Hales Aff.) at 11. The receiver thus recommended return of regulatory \nauthority to DMR, followed by transfer to the Office of Child Care Services (\"OCCS\") of the \nauthority to license JRC's programs for children. Id. at 2-3. Notably, although JRC objected to \nOCCS' s assuming licensing authority, the receiver rejected those objections on grounds that they \nwere based on \"historic concerns arising from the actions of . . . OFC,\" which could not be \nattributed to its successor agency: \n7  Although the SJC affirmed the finding of contempt, it did so by applying a preponderance-of-\nthe-evidence standard, which the Court has since clarified does not \"adequately characterize[] \nthe level of certainty appropriate to justify civil contempt sanctions.\" In re Birchall, 454 Mass. \n837, 852 (2009) (abrogating JRC). Under the current rule, the complainant bears the burden of \nproving contempt by clear and convincing evidence. Id. \n8 \n\nMore than sixteen years have passed since Judge Rotenberg approved the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement between JRC and OFC. Since that time, a new agency, DIVIR, was \nconstituted and OFC was reconstituted into today's OCCS. Agency regulations have \nchanged, as have commissioners and staff. The actions of OFC in the 1980's, however \nimproper, should not forever preclude OCCS . . . from licensing JRC's programs . . . . \nId. at 7. \nIn September 2003 many regulatory functions were returned to DMR, pursuant to an \norder entered by this Court.  Behavioral Research Inst. v. Philip Campbell,  Order of Bristol \nCounty Probate Court (Sept. 4, 2003) (LaStaiti, J.) (attached as Exh. 5 to Hales Aff.). Then, in \nApril 2006, after a decade, the receivership was formally terminated.  Behavioral Research Inst.  \nv. Philip Campbell,  Order of Bristol County Probate Court (Apr. 16, 2006) (LaStaiti, J.) \n(attached as Exh. 6 to Hales Aff.). \nIII. CURRENT FACTUAL SITUATION \nA.(cid:9)  Defendants' Compliance with the Decree \nIn the over six years since the receivership ended, the Commonwealth's agencies have \nconsistently complied with their obligations under the decree. Upon termination of the \nreceivership, all administrative and regulatory functions were returned to DMR, and then its \nsuccessor DDS. These functions have included certifying and licensing programs for adults with \nintellectual and developmental disability; granting approval to occupy and licensing residences \noccupied by adults with intellectual and developmental disability; investigating and disposing of \nabuse complaints; appointing independent clinicians to review court-approved treatment plans; \ndeveloping individual support plans; reviewing proposals and contracts between DDS and JRC; \nand reviewing restraint forms. Howe Aff.  1121. \nSince 2006, DDS has regulated JRC in a transparent manner in all these areas. It has \ngranted licenses to JRC to operate its residences and day programs, investigated complaints of \nabuse with impartiality, monitored restraint use, certified JRC's Level III program based on \ncomprehensive and impartial review by a team of experts, and, when necessary, engaged in \narbitration before the court monitor. Howe Aff.  ¶1122-84.  Thus, in stark contrast to the conduct \n9 \n\nof OFC that led to filing of this case in the 1980s, DDS has worked with JRC to license and \nregulate its programs with transparency and in compliance with the decree.  See  id. ?It 18-21, 52; \nsee generally  id. ¶¶ 22-84. \nB. (cid:9) Professional Consensus Opposing the Types of Aversive Interventions \nCurrently Used by JRC \nThe types of aversive interventions used at JRC have changed significantly since this \naction was filed over 25 years ago. Now, JRC's primary technique is the graduated electronic \ndecelerator (\"GED\" or \"contingent skin shock\"), which is used to administer an electric skin \nshock when a client engages in maladaptive behavior. Howe Aff.  IN 34. The GED is a more \nrecent intervention that was not in use in the 1980s, Howe Aff. ¶ 34; Compl. ¶ 16, and is deemed \na \"Level III\" aversive under DDS regulations.  See  115 C.M.R. 5.14(3)(d) (defining \"Level III \nInterventions\" to include \"[a]ny Intervention which involves the contingent application of \nphysical contact aversive stimuli such as . . . contingent skin shock\"). 8  \nContrary to JRC's practices, the overwhelming weight of professional opinion opposes \nthe use of Level HI interventions such as the GED. Dr. Gary LaVigna, Clinical Director of the \nInstitute for Applied Behavior Analysis in Los Angeles, states that, since 1985, clinical and \nempirical research has developed such that there is now a \"consensus\" professional opinion that \npositive behavior supports (\"PBS\")—applied behavior analysis without punishment—can be \nused to effectively treat people with challenging behaviors. Affidavit of Dr. Gary LaVigna \n(\"LaVigna Aff.\") (attached as Exh. C) 1114-16.  While PBS was still in its infancy in the mid-\n1980s, numerous studies over the past 25 years have established its effectiveness, even in cases \nwhere punishment has failed. Id. ¶¶ 5-6. Thus, given the ethical principle and legal \nrequirements that treatment must be accomplished by the least restrictive means possible, and in \n The Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has recently raised questions concerning whether \n8 \nJRC has obtained necessary approvals for the current versions of the GED device that it is using \nat its facility. Specifically, in December 2012, the FDA sent a letter to JRC stating that it had \nviolated federal law by failing to get preapproval or clearance to use its GED3A and GED4 \ndevices. See Dec. 6, 2012, Warning Letter (CMS # 367480),  located at \nhttp://www.fda.gov/ICECl/EnforcementAction  s/WarningLetters/2012/ucm331291.htm.  \n10 \n\ncontrast to the professional opinion that may have prevailed when the decree was entered in the \n1980s, the current consensus is that punitive procedures are \"professionally unnecessary and \ninappropriate\" and \" not ethical.\" Id.  ItIf 4, 9. Instead, \"PBS has reached the point where it is the \ngenerally accepted standard of care in the relevant treatment community.\" Id.  ¶ 60. \nWith respect to contingent skin shock specifically, given its severity, there is \"near-\nuniversal agreement\" that it is \"professionally unnecessary and inappropriate because there are \nother, far less restrictive methods available to treat challenging behaviors.\" LaVigna Aff.  ¶ 15. \nDr. LaVigna describes contingent skin shock as a \"much more intrusive and restrictive \nintervention\" than any of the aversive procedures listed in the complaint or in the decree (water \nsprays, taste aversives, muscle squeezes, spanks, pinches, and restrained time out). Id.  ¶ 14; see  \nCompl. ¶ 16; Decree at 2-3. \nDr. LaVigna's opinions are consistent with the position statements of virtually every \nmajor professional and advocacy organization for disability rights. For example, the American \nAssociation on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (\"AAIDD\"), a leading national \nprofessional organization, has stated that \"[r]esearch indicates that aversive procedures such as \ndeprivation, physical restraint and seclusion do not reduce challenging behaviors, and in fact can \ninhibit the development of appropriate skills and behaviors. These practices are dangerous, \ndehumanizing, result in a loss of dignity, and are unacceptable in a civilized society ... The \nMA Chapter of AAIDD and the Region X Board of AAIDD fully support . . efforts to eradicate \naversives from future behavioral plans.\" Howe Aff. ¶ 88 & Exh. 8 at 597, 599. The Arc, a \nnational advocacy organization, has also issued a position statement in favor of using PBS for \ntreatment of individuals with intellectual and developmental disability. Id.  1188 & Exh. 8 at 314-\n15. Similarly, TASH, another national advocacy organization, has concluded that, \"[a]lthough it \nhas been believed that [aversive] . . procedures are necessary to control dangerous or disruptive \nbehaviors, it has now been irrefutably proven that a wide range of methods are available that are \nnot only more effective in managing dangerous or disruptive behaviors, but do not inflict pain \n11 \n\non, humiliate, dehumanize or overly control or manipulate individuals with disabilities. . . . \nTherefore, TASH affirms the right of all persons with disability to freedom from overly \nrestrictive procedures and from aversive or coercive procedures of any kind. TASH is \nunequivocally opposed to the inappropriate use of restraint and to the use of overly restrictive \nand aversive procedures under any circumstances and calls for the cessation of the use of all such \nprocedures.\" Id. ¶ 88 & Exh. 8 at 590-91. 9  \nMoreover, numerous settlement agreements and remedies obtained by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (\"DOJ\") in major civil-rights cases regarding systems of care for persons \nwith intellectual and developmental disabilities reflect an emphasis on PBS and prohibitions on \naversive interventions. Howe Aff. ¶¶ 14-17.10  And a similar result was reached in a recent \nfederal class action against the Minnesota Department of Human Services, in which the parties \nentered into a settlement agreement that prohibited the use of aversives for persons in the state's \ncare and established a statewide acceptance of positive behavioral supports. Id. ¶ 17. \nFinally, these standards are reflected in the laws and practices of the majority of other \nstates. DDS is unaware of any other state that has authorized the use of aversives such as \ncontingent skin shock. Id. ¶ 89. Further, 21 states have affirmatively banned aversives through \n9  Many other organizations have issued similar statements, as described in the Howe affidavit at \n¶ 88 and the attached exhibits. \n1°  Consistent with the remedies in those cases, DOJ sent the Commonwealth a letter in May \n2011 informing it of an investigation regarding whether its use of JRC as a service setting \nviolated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act. Howe Aff. ¶ 117. \nLikewise, in July 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") sent a letter \nraising \"serious concerns\" about whether the Commonwealth was complying with the \nrequirement that it \"protect the health and welfare of certain Medicaid participants with mental \nretardation. Id. ¶ 118. The letter observed that \"Hublished descriptions of aversive \ninterventions and deprivation procedures [at JRC] provide a picture of residential settings which \ncannot be characterized as 'home-like.' Aversive and intrusive interventions reportedly include \nrepeated and painful electric shock, potentially unnecessary restraint and seclusion, and meal \ndeprivation.\" Id. ¶ 118. In December 2012 CMS sent another letter stating that, after review, it \nhad determined that the Commonwealth had failed to assure the \"health and welfare\" of certain \n \nMedicaid recipients, as required by federal law, because they were receiving Level III \ninterventions at JRC. Id. ¶ 119. \n12 \n\nstatute, regulation, or policy, and many others have banned their use in practice. Id. This \nincludes New York, which has placed students at JRC as authorized by that state's law.  Bryant \nv. N.Y. State Educ. Dep't,  692 F.3d 202, 208 (2d Cir. 2012), petition for cert. filed,  (U.S. Jan. 2, \n2013) (No. 12-932). In 2006 New York's education agency repudiated the practices used by \nJRC by promulgating a regulation \"prohibiting schools, including 'approved out-of-state day or \nresidential schools' (such as JRC), from using aversive interventions.\" Id. at 209. That \nregulation was recently upheld by the Second Circuit against challenges under the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the federal and New York \nconstitutions.  See  id. at 212-19. \nC. (cid:9) DDS's Recent Regulation Banning Level  III  Aversives and the Testimony \nand Comments in Support of the Ban \nIn line with this professional consensus, in October 2011, DDS amended its \"Behavior \nModification\" regulation to provide that \"kilo program which is operated, funded or licensed by \n[DDS] shall employ the use of Level III Aversive Interventions.\" 115 C.M.R. 5.14(4)(b)(3). \nExceptions may be granted only on an \"individual-specific\" basis to people \"who, as of \nSeptember 1, 2011, have an existing court-approved treatment plan which includes the use of \nLevel III Aversive Interventions; provided further that any such exception may be granted each \nyear thereafter if the exception is contained in the behavior treatment plan that has been \napproved by the court prior to September 1, 2011.\" Id. 5.14(4)(b)(4). As of January 17, 2013, \n86 individuals at JRC had court-approved treatment plans that authorized the use of Level III \naversives. Howe Aff. ¶ 103. These are the only individuals who fall within the exception \ncontained in the new regulation. Id. Tif 102-03. \nDDS promulgated the regulation after fully complying with the requirements of chapter \n30A. In June 2011 DDS issued a notice of its intent to amend the regulation to ban the use of \nLevel III aversives. Id. 1185.  It then held two full days of public hearings on the proposed \namendment and reviewed and considered the testimony and comments of hundreds of interested \nparties including human-rights organizations; clinicians and professionals serving individuals \n13 \n\nwith disabilities and severe behavioral challenges; provider organizations; a union whose \nmembers serve individuals with disabilities; family members of individuals with intellectual \ndisabilities, autism, and other disabilities with challenging behaviors; attorneys representing such \nindividuals; and national, state, and local disability organizations, including the Massachusetts \nchapter of AAIDD, the Arc of Massachusetts, TASH, the President's National Council on \nDisabilities, the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disability Services, \nthe Association of Developmental Disability Providers, the Massachusetts Developmental \nDisabilities Council, and many others. Id. TT 86-88. Further, JRC itself participated in the \npublic hearings by offering oral and written comments. Id. ¶ 87. \nThe comments received by DDS overwhelmingly supported adoption of the proposed \nregulation.  Id.  7187-88.  In fact, no one outside the JRC community spoke in favor of the \ncontinued use of Level III aversives.  Id.  Out of 360 combined written and oral comments, \nalmost 300 supported the proposed ban. Id. ¶ 87. And all of the comments in opposition were \nsubmitted by people affiliated with JRC, including 59 JRC employees. Id. \nD. (cid:9) The Impediment Posed by the Decree to Proper Regulation of \nJRC and Its Use of Level III Aversives \nIn conflict with this near-universal agreement outside the JRC community that PBS \nshould be used in place of aversive interventions, the decree has constrained DDS from ensuring \nthat JRC is practicing the \"least restrictive\" and \"least intrusive\" treatment methods, as required \nby the regulations. 115 C.M.R. 5.14(1)(c); see  id. 5.14(4)(b), 5.14(4)(c). As mentioned, JRC is \nthe sole provider in the state that is certified to use and is currently using Level III aversives. \nHowe Aff. ¶ 102. With all other providers, DDS conducts surveys to ensure that they are using \nthe least restrictive and least intrusive treatments and are complying with all other DDS \nregulations. 115 C.M.R. 8.04(4). If DDS sees any deficiencies, it will order corrective action, \nand providers can lose their license or certification if they do not comply. Id. 5.14(4)(f)(1), \n8.04(6), 8.04(7), 8.33. In such an event, the provider has  a right of appeal through ordinary \nadministrative channels. Id. 5.14(4)(f)(8), 8.34. \n14 \n\nBecause of the decree, DDS has been hamstrung in its attempts to apply these established \nregulatory procedures to JRC. This is because JRC has consistently taken the position that the \ndecree gives it the affirmative right to use aversives, in perpetuity, and that DDS has no authority \nto regulate in this area. E.g., JRC's Demand for Arbitration (July 6, 2011) (Howe Aff. ¶ 85, Exh. \n7 at 187) (\"In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, DDS may not prohibit the use of \naversives.\"). Since the receivership ended in 2006, DDS has repeatedly identified serious issues \nrelating to JRC's use of Level III aversives and has imposed conditions in an attempt to bring \nJRC's programs into compliance with the regulations. E.g., Howe Aff. ?If 53-55, 67-69, 73-77. \nNormally, failure to comply with such conditions would result in decertification. 115 C.M.R. \n5.14(4)(f)(1), 8.33; Howe AEI 72, 80. But unlike other providers, JRC has claimed a right not \nto comply with DDS's orders, asserting that the agency was violating the decree by seeking to \nenforce its regulations. Howe Aff. ¶¶ 77, 80. And when DDS has expressed disagreement or \ntried to institute administrative action, JRC has responded by demanding arbitration before the \ncourt monitor (cid:9) a remedy that is unavailable to every other provider in the Commonwealth. Id_  \nTT 77-80 & Exhs. 7, 16, 17. \nJRC's actions during the 2011 rulemaking further demonstrate how the decree has \ndistorted the regulatory relationship. Despite the complete transparency of the process and \nDDS's full compliance with chapter 30A, when DDS issued notice of the proposed amendment, \nJRC responded with a demand for arbitration, asserting that DDS was violating the decree by \nengaging in rulemaking, even though it is indisputably authorized to do so under its enabling \nstatute. See G.L. c. 19B, § 1 (granting broad power to Commissioner of DDS to supervise \"all \nmatters affecting the welfare of . . . persons with an intellectual disability\" and \"all private \nfacilities for such persons\"); id. § 14 (granting broad rulemaking power to Commissioner). In its \nletter JRC demanded that DDS \"immediately withdraw the Proposed Amendments and cancel \nany public hearings about same as they constitute acts of contempt subjecting DDS, the \nCommonwealth, and responsible parties to contempt sanctions and penalties.\" Howe Aff. ¶ 85, \n15 \n\nExh. 7 at 185. Alternatively, JRC demanded \"immediate arbitration\" under the decree, claiming \nthat it would otherwise \"seek relief from the court, including contempt proceedings against DDS \nand all other responsible parties.\" Id. Although it ultimately did not file a contempt action, JRC \nhas maintained repeatedly that, because of the decree, DDS has no authority to either limit or \neliminate its use of aversive interventions. Howe Aff.  TT 77-80, 85. \nARGUMENT  \nI. (cid:9) THE DECREE SHOULD BE VACATED UNDER MASS. R. CIV. P. 60(b)(5) \nBECAUSE INTERVENING CHANGES IN FACT AND LAW HAVE RENDERED \nCONTINUED APPLICATION \"NO LONGER EQUITABLE.\" \nA.(cid:9)  A Flexible, Equitable Standard, Informed by Separation-of-Powers \nPrinciples, Governs Motions to Vacate Consent Decrees in Institutional \nReform Litigation. \nMass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where \"it is no longer equitable \nthat the judgment should have prospective application.\" This Rule \"derives from the traditional \npower of a court of equity to modify its decree in light of changed circumstances.\"  Mitchell v.  \nMitchell,  62 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 778 (2005). Although there is little caselaw discussing a \nparty's precise burden under the Rule, the few courts that have considered the issue have \nunifonnly concluded that these motions should be governed by the flexible standard set forth in \nRufo v Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,  502 U.S. 367 (1992).1  Under Rufo,  modification of a \nconsent decree is warranted if the moving party shows that there has been \"a significant change \neither in factual conditions or in law.\" Id. at 384. Changes that justify relief include \"when \nenforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest,\" \n Mitchell,  62 Mass.

Id. at 384, 388. \nIf the moving party makes this initial showing, the court must then deteimine \"whether \nthe proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" Id. at 391. \nComplete dissolution of a decree is warranted under this standard if the moving party \" `show[s] \nthat the decree has served its purpose, and there is no longer any need for the injunction.'\" \nMitchell,  62 Mass.

Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty.,  466 F.3d 391, \n395 (6th Cir. 2006). \nRecently, the Supreme Court has emphasized that Rufo's  flexible approach \"serves a \nparticularly important function in . . . 'institutional reform litigation.'\"  Horne v. Flores,  557 U.S. \n433, 447 (2009). This is due in large part to the fundamental separation-of-powers principles \nthat are implicated in such cases. As the Court observed, \"Finjunctions of this sort bind state . . . \nofficials to the policy preferences of their predecessors\"; yet \"the passage of time frequently \nbrings about changed circumstances—changes in the nature of the underlying problem, changes \nin governing law or its interpretation by the courts, and new policy insights—that warrant \nreexamination of the original judgment.\" Id. at 447-48 Enforcing an outdated decree thus runs \nthe risk of \"improperly depriv[ing] future officials of their designated legislative and executive \npowers.\" Id. at 449 (quotations marks omitted); see Rufo,  502 U.S. at 381 (\"the public interest is \na particularly significant reason for applying a flexible modification standard in institutional \nreform litigation because such decrees reach beyond the parties involved directly in the suit and \nimpact on the public's right to the sound and efficient operation of its institutions\"). 12  \n Although federalism concerns are also implicated when a decree is entered by a federal court \n12 \nagainst a state agency, the analyses in Horne  and Rufo  make clear that separation of powers is an \nequally important consideration in determining whether Rule 60(b)(5) relief should be granted. \nSee Home,  557 U.S. at 447-50; Rufo,  502 U.S. at 381, 392-93; see also Glisson v.

By necessary extension a consent decree that encroaches on executive \nfunctions must be vacated where the agency demonstrates that circumstances have changed since \nentry of the decree such that judicial oversight is no longer necessary.  See Horne,  557 U.S. at \n447 (once a state agency shows that factual or legal changes render continued enforcement of a \nconsent decree contrary to the public interest, \"a court abuses its discretion when it refuses to \nmodify . . . [the] consent decree in light of such changes\") (quotation marks omitted). Indeed, \nwere the rule otherwise, the agency will be perpetually subject to the jurisdiction of the court \neven absent any ongoing violation of the law. This would an unlawful usurpation of executive \nfunctions because \"[t]he determination of where and how [an agency] will carry out its statutory, \nregulatory, and any constitutional obligations is . . . for it to decide.\"  In re McKnight,  406 Mass. \n787 (1990); see Correia,  402 Mass. at 169-70 (\"[g]iven the defendant's status as a public \nagency,\" it was \"inappropriate\" for lower court to enter injunction that specified procedures \nagency must follow to discharge its regulatory functions; instead, court \"must allow the agency \nto exercise its discretion\" to decide how to bring its practices within requirements of the law). \nHere, two significant changes in circumstances require vacatur of the consent decree \nunder Rule 60(b)(5). First, the purpose of the decree has been fulfilled, as the parties intended \nthat it last for only as long as needed to remedy JRC for OFC' s past bad acts. Because judicial \nsupervision is thus no longer necessary, and indeed improper, the appropriate modification under \nRufo  is vacatur of the decree in its entirety.  See Mitchell,  62 Mass. App. Ct. at 779. Second, at a \nminimum, Part A of the decree should be vacated because current clinical evidence shows that \nuse of Level III aversives no longer conforms to the accepted professional standard of care, and \n18 \n\nDDS has amended its regulations to incorporate this new standard. It would therefore be \ndetrimental to the public interest for the decree to have continued application. \nB. (cid:9) The Decree Should Be Vacated in Its Entirety Because Its Purpose Has Been \nFulfilled. \nWhen the facts demonstrate that a decree entered against a public agency has \nsubstantially served its objective, vacatur is required because prospective application would no \nlonger meet the requirements of equity. Separation of powers mandates this result because, \notherwise, the agency would be improperly \"condemn[ed]\" by the acts of its predecessors \"to \njudicial tutelage for the indefinite future.\"  Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub. Schs. v. Dowell;  498 \nU.S. 237, 249 (1991); see Home,  557 U.S. at 450 (if objective of injunction has been achieved, \ncontinued enforcement against a state agency \"is not only unnecessary, but improper\");  King v  \nGreenblatt,  52 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"King I\") (\"In institutional reform litigation, injunctions \nshould not operate inviolate in perpetuity.\") (quotation marks omitted). \nThe decree here should be vacated because it has served its ultimate purpose (cid:9) to remedy \nthe acts taken by OFC in the 1980s and which were repeated to some extent by OFC's successor, \nDMR, in the mid-1990s. Both the complaint and the settlement agreement demonstrate the \nparties' intent that the decree endure for only as long as necessary for JRC to be remedied for \nthose discrete acts. The claims and allegations of the complaint were plainly directed at \nOFC's—and in particular, the Director's—past conduct.  See generally  Compl. Consistent with \nthe complaint, the agreement states that it was \"made for this case only\" and that the \"sole intent \nof each party\" was \"simply to resolve this case and the other administrative and judicial cases \nwhich [were then] pending between O.F.C.,  [JRC] and the parents.\" Decree at 2. And most \nimportantly, the agreement provides that it would \"automatically terminate at the second [six-\nmonth] review unless the Court, for good cause shown related to the terms or substance of [the] \nagreement, orders otherwise.\" Id. at 13. \nThis termination provision shows that the parties contemplated that judicial oversight \nwould last for approximately one year, at which point JRC would be fully remedied for OFC's \n19 \n\npast acts. This Court did not, and could not, alter the parties' intent by extending the decree \n\"until . . . further order.\" Order (July 7, 1988). The extension does not mean that the decree \noperates in perpetuity; rather, the sole basis for the Court's order was that, at the time of the \nhearing in 1988, JRC was \"not fully licensed.\" Id. JRC has long since been operating with a full \nlicense, both before and after the receivership, and so there is no longer a reason for the \nextension. See Consumer Advisory Bd. v. Harvey, 697 F. Supp. 2d 131, 137 (D. Me. 2010) \n(terminating consent decree where State satisfied benchmarks delineated in decree, which \n\"contemplate[d] the potential for termination within a year of the closing of [the institution] if \n[those] benchmarks [were] met\"); Basel v. Bielaczyz, No. 74-40135-BC, 2009 WL 2843906, at \n*7 (RD. Mich. Sept. 1, 2009) (vacating 30-year-old consent judgment where its teens suggested \nthat it would only last for three years). \nSeparation-of-powers principles compel this conclusion. Courts lack the authority to \nenforce an order \"concerning the carrying out of an executive function\" unless there is a \n\"demonstrated basis for concluding that the [agency] has broadly abrogated its statutory duties in \nthe face of a judicial direction to fulfil[l] them.\" Bradley, 386 Mass. at 365; see McKnight, 406 \nMass. at 801 (\"In the absence of [an agency's] abdication of its function, it is not . . . appropriate \nfor a judge to exercise the [agency's] executive functions.\"). Here, it has been over 25 years \nsince the decree was entered and over six years since the receivership was tenninated. Since \n1995 no agency has been held in contempt for failure to comply with the decree. Moreover, \nonce the receivership ended, DDS has continued to work cooperatively with JRC: it engaged in \narbitration before the court monitor; extended JRC's Level III certification several times; and \ncomplied with all the requirements of chapter 30A before promulgating the 2011 regulation, \ngiving JRC a full opportunity to submit testimony and written comments. Howe Aff. ¶¶ 18-21, \n52, 85-87; see generally id. lilt 22-87. In short, there is no indication that the defendant agencies \nhave \"broadly abrogated\" their duties under the decree so as to authorize the Court to continue to \nintervene in the exercise of their executive functions. Bradley, 386 Mass. at 365. The \n20 \n\ndefendants' years of compliance, and the terms of the decree itself, show that the decree is no \nlonger necessary and that prospective application would be not only inequitable, but \ninappropriate.  See Mass Port. Auth.,  2003 WL 23163113, at *17 n.52 (\"The amount of time a \nparty has been 'burdened' by the injunction and the prospect of its continuing are factors that \ncourts have weighed in evaluating a request for relief under Rule 60(b)(5).\") (citing  Rufo,  502 \nU.S. at 380-81); Home,  557 U.S. at 453 (\"[T]he longer an injunction or consent decree stays in \nplace, the greater the risk that it will improperly interfere with a State's democratic processes.\"). \nNumerous federal courts have reached the same outcome in analogous circumstances. \nFor example, in the desegregation context, the Supreme Court has consistently held that judicial \noversight should \"not extend beyond the time required to remedy the effects of past intentional \ndiscrimination,\" and so a decree must be dissolved after the agency has complied with it for a \nperiod of time sufficient to eliminate, \"to the extent practicable,\" the vestiges of the \ndiscrimination.  Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City,  498 U.S. at 248, 250. Applying similar rationale, the \nEleventh Circuit in R.C. v. Walley,  No. 07-10667, 2008 WL 816679 (11th Cir. Mar. 27, 2008),13  \nupheld the district court's decision to terminate an 18-year-old decree that required a state \nagency to implement refoims to its child-welfare system. Termination was warranted, in the \ncourt's view, because the agency had demonstrated a history of compliance and the system, \nthough \"not yet perfect,\" \"had undergone radical changes and was on secure footing to continue \nits progress in the years to come, without court supervision.\" Id. at *2. Other lower federal \ncourts have regularly vacated judgments on the same basis. I4  \n13  Citable as persuasive authority under Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 11th Cir. R. 36-3. \n14  Berne Corp. v. Gov't of the Virgin Islands,  No. 2000-141, 2011 WL 182862, at *7-*8 (D.V.I. \nJan. 20, 2011) (\"inequitable\" to preserve injunction where government's \"recent perfonnance\" \nshowed that it cured due-process deficiencies that were reason for the injunction);  Consumer \nAdvisory Bd.,  697 F. Supp. 2d at 138 (\"inequitable\" to continue to monitor State's compliance \nwith decree where it already complied for a decade and had \"the commitment and mechanisms to \ncontinue to provide a system that will protect the class members' rights under the Constitution \nand federal law\"); Basel,  2009 WL 2843906, at *7 (state's history of compliance showed that \n\"the need for the injunction passed\" and the \"responsibility for discharging the State's \n21 \n\nThis Court should hold likewise. As the receiver observed in 2003, the Commonwealth's \ncurrent agencies cannot be forever held to the past bad acts of their predecessors because of \n\"historic concerns arising from the actions of . . OFC.\" Hales Aff., Exh. 4 at 7. \"Agency \nregulations have changed, as have commissioners and staff,\" id., and the public \"[depends] upon \nsuccessor officials . . . to bring new insights and solutions to problems\" within their area of \nexpertise.  Home,  557 U.S. at 449 (quotation marks omitted). So where, as here, the officials \n\"inherit overbroad or outdated consent decrees,\" it is the public who suffers because the officials \n\"are constrained in their ability to fulfill their duties.\" Id. (quotation marks omitted). For all \nthese reasons, the time has come, after over two decades, to return full regulatory authority to the \ndefendant agencies and allow them to restore a normal regulatory relationship with JRC. In the \nfuture JRC can protect its rights through the same administrative-appeal processes afforded to all \nother providers in the Commonwealth.  See Bellevue Manor Assocs. v. United States,  165 F.3d \n1249, 1257 (9th Cir. 1999) (equities \"clearly\" tipped in favor of vacating injunction against \nfederal agency where continued enforcement would allow plaintiffs to receive \"unfair \npreferential treatment\" over other program participants);  Consumer Advisory Bd.,  697 F. Supp. \n2d at 138-39 (equities required vacatur where State had mechanisms in place to protect plaintiffs' \nrights and so any future grievances could be \"presented in the appropriate state forum\"). \nC. (cid:9) Alternatively, Part A of the Decree Should Be Vacated Because Significant \nFactual and Legal Changes Relating to the Standard of Care Render \nProspective Enforcement Inequitable. \n1. (cid:9) The Current Clinical Approach to Behavior Modification Is a Significant \nFactual Change Warranting Relief.  \nAt a minimum Part A of the decree should be vacated or stricken from the decree because \nthe clinical evidence has evolved such that use of Level III aversives can no longer be said to \nobligations was long ago ripe to be returned to the State\") (quotation marks omitted);  Glisson,  \n2008 WL 5156274, at *3 (injunction was \"no longer needed because the facts on the ground \n[had] vastly changed for the better\" and so judicial oversight would be \"inappropriate in light of \nthe [federal agency's] independent responsibility as a part of the Executive Branch to manage its \naffairs without undue interference from the Judicial Branch\"). \n22 \n\nmeet the accepted standard of care for treatment of individuals with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disability. Continued enforcement of Part A, which JRC maintains gives it the \naffilmative right to use aversives, would therefore be \"detrimental to the public interest\" and \n\"unworkable,\" warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  Rufo,  502 U.S. at 384; see Horne,  557 \nU.S. at 467 (finding relevant factual change where \"weight of research\" suggested that structural \nrefouns, not increased funding mandated by the injunction, would \"lead to improved educational \nopportunities\"). \nAs discussed above, the overwhelming professional consensus is that PBS is more \neffective and less intrusive than Level III aversives and should be used in their place. Since the \ndecree was entered in the mid-1980s, clinical and empirical research has developed and now \ndemonstrates that PBS is an effective method of treating people with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disability, rendering punitive procedures \"professionally unnecessary\" and \n\"unethical.\" LaVigna Aff. TT 4-16, 60. And with respect to contingent skin shock, there is \n\"near-universal agreement\" that it is \"professionally unnecessary and inappropriate because there \nare other, far less restrictive methods available to treat challenging behaviors.\" Id.  ¶ 15. This \nprofessional consensus is reflected in the policy statements of leading disability-rights \norganizations, the testimony and comments that DDS received during the public-comment \nperiod, and by the laws and practices of other states banning aversive interventions. Given this \nvolume of evidence, JRC has no reasonable claim that Part A of the decree is consistent with the \npublic interest, and so the equities mandate that it be vacated.  See Rufo,  502 U.S. at 384. \nThe First Circuit's decision in King v. Greenblatt,  149 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"King III\"), \nsupports this result. At issue there was a 24-year-old consent decree governing the treatment of \nsexually dangerous persons civilly committed to the Treatment Center at the Massachusetts \nCorrectional Institute in Bridgewater (\"Center\"). Id. at 12;  see King I,  52 F.3d at 2. The relevant \nportion of the decree prohibited the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") from using the Center's \nsolitary-confinement unit for purposes of punishment, on the theory that \"'disciplinary and \n23 \n\npunitive procedures [had] no place in the care and treatment of civilly committed patients.\" \nKing III,  149 F.3d at 19. The First Circuit affitined the allowance of DOC's motion to strike this \nprohibition, holding that such relief was warranted by \"a significant change in the philosophical \napproach to treatment of civilly committed sex offenders in programs operated by correctional \ndepartments.\" Id. Specifically, although there had not been \"a complete reversal of position,\" \nthe court found that \"the monolithic acceptance of the mental health approach that existed a \nquarter of a century ago [when the decree was entered] had yielded to the acknowledgment that \nthere is no royal road to treatment and cure.\" Id. As a result, most other states had repealed their \nlaws to no longer bar imposing discipline on sex offenders—a fact that the court found \n\"[i]ndicative of some kind of sea change \" Id. The court also found it significant that various \nprofessional associations had recommended repeal on the ground that \"the assumption that \nmental disability underlay sexual offenses in general was no longer viewed as clinically valid.\" \nId. at 20 (emphasis omitted). All of this evidence led the court in the end \"to accept as a \nsignificant change of fact the adoption of a new treatment approach,\" entitling DOC to \nmodification of the decree. Id. at 21. \nThe circumstances of King  are strikingly similar to those here. The decree in this case \nhas also been in place for over two decades, and, during that time, there has been a significant \nchange in the accepted approach to treatment of people with intellectual and developmental \ndisability. When the complaint was filed, the techniques being used by JRC—water sprays, taste \naversives, and muscle squeezes—were \"accepted\" as \"clinical[ly]\" and \"professionally \nappropriate\" and \"confoon[ed] to the standards\" of the professional field. Compl.  TT 17, 86. \nOFC apparently had no evidence that these techniques were harmful to the students or that there \nwere alternative treatments that would serve them adequately. Id.  r 38-39. But currently, some \n25 years later, JRC is using an intervention that is \"much more intrusive and restrictive\" than any \nof the aversive procedures listed in the consent decree, and there is \"near-universal agreement\" \nthat its practices are \"professionally unnecessary and inappropriate.\" LaVigna Aff.  /11t 14-15; see \n24 \n\nKing III, 149 F.3d at 21-22 (trial court properly considered \"'vastly different' conditions of \nconfinement in the [Center's seclusion] unit today compared to those described in the [original] \ncomplaint\" in determining whether modification of the decree was warranted). \nMoreover, it is \"[i]ndicative of some kind of sea change\" that DDS's current ban on \nLevel III aversives is \"consistent with standards found in . . . programs nationwide\" and with \nrecommendations of major professional organizations. King III, 149 F.3d at 19-20 (quotation \nmarks omitted). As those organizations have concluded, aversives are not consistent with best \npractices and should be eliminated as an acceptable method for behavior modification. Howe \nAff. ¶ 88. Thus, as in King, the evidence here shows that there has been a significant change in \nfacts—namely, \"the adoption of a new treatment approach\"—that warrants vacating or striking \nPart A of the decree as contrary to the public interest. King III, 149 F.3d at 21;  see  Reynolds v.  \nMcInnes, 338 F.3d 1221, 1229 (11th Cir. 2003) (lower court properly removed provision of \nconsent decree that restricted State's use of certain employment-testing methods where experts \ntestified that the restriction \"was novel or unusual in the field of employment testing\" and \n\"almost preclude[d] best professional practices\"); United States v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., \nNo. 88-1886-CIV, 2011 WL 1099865, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 22, 2011) (State was entitled to \nrelief from provision of decree that required it to construct a reservoir to achieve environmental \nrestoration where \"evolving scientific evidence led almost every expert to agree that the . . . \nreservoir [was] not the best course of action to achieve restoration\"). \n2. (cid:9) DDS's 2011 Regulation Banning Level III Aversives Is a Significant \nFactual and Legal Change Warranting Relief.  \nIntervening law that conflicts with the requirements of a decree constitutes a significant \nchange, which courts have characterized as both legal and factual, justifying modification under \nRule 60(b)(5). See Horne, 557 U.S. at 459-468; Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388. DDS's 2011 regulation \nqualifies as a relevant change under this standard. \nAs mentioned, JRC has consistently taken the position that Part A of the decree gives it \nthe affifinative right to use aversives, irrespective of DDS regulations. Howe Aff. ¶ 80. That \n25 \n\nposition cannot, however, be reconciled with the new regulation, which affirmatively bans the \nuse of aversives on a prospective basis. 115 C.M.R. 5.14. Nor can the regulation be reconciled \nwith JRC's position that it has the right to arbitrate any dispute concerning the availability of \naversives. Howe Aff. IN 77, 80. Because the regulation is consistent with accepted professional \npractices, neither the court monitor, nor the Court itself, has the authority to prohibit DDS from \nenforcing the regulation against JRC.  See McKnight,  406 Mass. at 798-801 (probate court \nlacked authority to issue permanent injunction directing that aversives be available for use by \nJRC because, \"[i]f accepted professional practices would tolerate the unavailability or the nonuse \nof aversives . . and the department elects to follow that professional practice, the courts must \nrespect that judgment\"); Guardianship of Anthony,  402 Mass. at 727 (probate court \n\"impermissibl[y] poach[ed] . . on executive and legislative territories\" when it ordered AIDS \ntests on residents of DMH-regulated facility in absence of evidence \"that testing for AIDS [was] \nan appropriate, let alone the only, means by which\" DMH could fulfill its statutory duties). 15  \nAccordingly, the decree, as historically interpreted and invoked by JRC, presents an \ninherent conflict with the regulation, which was promulgated in full compliance with chapter \n30A. For this additional reason, Part A of the decree should be stricken or vacated.  See Home, \n557 U.S. at 461-64 (remanding for consideration of new statute that marked shift in federal \neducation policy, which Court found could warrant modification of injunction that conflicted \nwith that policy); Calderon v. Wambua_,  No. 74 Civ. 4868, 2012 WL 1075840, at *4-*6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2012) (vacating parts of decree that mandated procedures that City had to \nfollow before promulgating regulations, where City later adopted an administrative-procedure \nstatute that made compliance with the decree substantially more onerous). \n15  Were any of the remaining student class plaintiffs to assert a constitutional right to aversive \ntreatment, the law is now clear that no such right exists.  McKnight,  406 Mass. at 801 (there is no \n\"constitutional right to elect (pursuant to substituted judgment principles) among placements and \ntreatment procedures that are acceptable to qualified professionals\"). \n26 \n\nIL IN THE ALTERNATIVE THE DECREE SHOULD BE VACATED UNDER \nMASS. R. CIV. P. 60(b)(5) BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN \"SATISFIED.\" \nRule 60(b)(5) also authorizes relief from judgment if \"the judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged.\" Vacatur of the decree is warranted on this alternative basis. As \ndiscussed above in Part I.B, the decree provides for termination after the second six-month \nreview, and the sole basis for the extension order was that, at the time, JRC was not fully \nlicensed. JRC has been licensed and certified at least as of the mid-1990s and has been \nrecertified numerous times thereafter. Thus, under the plain language of the decree and the \nextension order, the decree has been satisfied and should be vacated.  See Consumer Advisory \nBd.,  697 F. Supp. 2d at 135-37 (consent decree was \"satisfied\" under Rule 60(b)(5) where state \nsubstantially complied with its benchmarks). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, this Court should enter judgment vacating the consent decree and \nteiniinating its jurisdiction over this case. \n27 \n\n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nCOMMISSIONERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \nDEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES and \nDEPARTMENT OF EARLY EDUCATION AND \nCARE \nBy their attorney, \nMARTHA COAKLEY \nATTORNEY GENERAL \nJennifer Grace Miller, BBO No. 636987 \nSookyoung Shin, BBO No. 643713 \nSarah M.

(\".TRC'), f/k/a Behavior Research Institute, and the \nclass of all students at JRC, their parents, and guardians as of September 26, 1985 (collectively, \n\"PlaintiITs\"), in response to this Court's Order, dated March 27, 2013, requiring all parties to \nsubmit to the Court proposed orders for discovery within thirty days. Because Defendants \npropose a piecemeal approach to discovery (and in particular suggest that their motion can be \ngranted based on facts already in the record, as the Consent Decree has \"fulfilled\" its purpose), it \nis necessary to consider both the legal issues raised by their mo6on and the existing record to \ndetennine an appropriate scope for initial discovery. We therefore set forth: (1) an overview of \n-\nthe JRC program; (2) the history of the litigation and the purposes now served by the Consent \nDecree; (3) the standard of review; (4) factual issues in dispute; and (5) the accompanying \nPlaintiffs' Proposed Order for Discovery. \nThe Consent Decree mandates that treatment decisions involving clients at JRC -\nincluding decisions as to whether aversive treatments should be used - are ultimately committed \nto tbjs Court in substituted judgment proceedings.  It also has several provisions designed to \nprevent Defendants from utilizing their regulatory powers in bad faith against JRC.  Defendants \nhave moved to vacate the Consent Decree in its entirety for two reasons.  First, tl1ey contend that \nthe sole purpose of the Consent Decree was to remedy Defendants' bad faith use of regulatory \npowers to deny licensure to JRC in 1986; that it was intended to terminate in a year; that it was \nextended in 1988 only because JRC bad not yet been fully licensed; and that it bas been \nimproperly extended since JRC has \"long since\" been fully licensed and Defendants have ceased \nto be in bad faith.  Accordingly, they argue, the purpose of the Consent Decree has been fulfilled, \nand prospective application is \"no longer equitable.\"  Defendants assert that this argument can be \n(K0500787.2)  2 \n\ndecided on the basis of the record alone, without the taking of evidence, and since that will be \nconclusive, it should be resolved first, by motion, without any discovery at all. \nDefendants apparently concede that their second claim does require the presentation of \nevidence, and discovery.  Their claim is that, even if the purpose of the Consent Decree has not \nbeen fulfilled, aversive treatments no longer conform to the accepted standard of care for \ntreatment of individuals with intellectual and developmental disability and they are unnecessary \nand unethical.  Defendant DDS has thus adopted new regulations to prohibit aversive treatments \nin all cases (except for those currently receiving them) and should therefore be allowed to apply \nthese regulations to JRC and any new candidates for the treatment.  In addition, Defendant DDS \nshould be allowed to make further amendments to the regulations, including banning aversive \ntreatment completely for all, including the members of the class, \"Without constraint by the \nConsent Decree. \nDefendants' approach to discovery (first deciding whether the purposes of the Consent \nDecree arc fulfilled, and only then taking evidence on the standard of care) is flawed for two \nreasons.  In the first place, the Consent Decree has two essential purposes, of which protection \nfrom Defendants' bad faith is only one.  The other purpose - and the foundational core of the \nrelief, according not only to Plaintiffs, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts \n(\"SJC') - ,,..as to protect Plaintiffs' substantive right to effective education and treatment, by \ncreating an enforceable means to secure aversive treatment if it can be established. in a substitute \njudgment proceeding in this Court, that this is the least restrictive means to meeting their health, \neducational. and safety needs.  See Rogers v. Comm 'r of Dep 't ofM  ental Health, 390 Mass. 489 \n( 1983). If Plaintiffs are correct in this view - and the review of the history of this case below \nwill demonstrate that we are - then evidence, preceded by discovery, cannot be avoided. \n. {K0500787 2)  3 \n\nMoreover, even the claim that Plaintiffs are no longer at risk of harm from future bad \nfaith regulatory conduct cannot be resolved without evidentiary hearing.  As will be discussed \nbelow. the case arises from a very pointed history involving two different commissioners in two \ndifferent decades, in which Defendants, or their predecessors, went to enom1ous lengths to \nprevent the use of aversive treatments at JRC, driven not by the treatment interests of JRC's \nClients but by ideological belief and the fear of negative media attention.  Failing in their effort to \n'-\naccomplish this end overtly, they abused their regulatory powers in a series of pretextual - even \ndishonest - steps designed to destroy JRC, and with it the aYersive treatments. The Consent \nDecree addresses this conduct both by committing the individual treatment decision to this Court \nand by protecting against regulatory abuse.  Thus, even if it were true that the prevention of bad \nfaith was the sole purpose of the Consent Decree, given the troubling evidence produced in this \nCourt in the past, and the previous findings as to serious misconduct by Defendants in the past, \nincluding deliberate attempts to mislead this Court, Defendants cannot expect the Court to \nsimply accept their current ipse dixit that \"that was then, this is now,\" and that their motives are \ntoday entirely pure.  Evidence is required on that issue as well. \nThus, as is shown below, there is no avoiding the presentation of evidence and the pre-\nhearing taking of discovery.  Given that, no purpose would be served by a piecemeal approach to \nthis litigation. The parties should be allowed to discover and present all the facts they need to \nmake their case at a hearing on all issues before the Court. \nII.  FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS \nA.  Oven·iew of the JRC Program \nJRC proYides intensive beba\\ioral treatment to children and adults with multiple \ndisabilities, including the most dangerous forms of behavior disorders in the nation.  JR C's \nclients have multiple diagnoses such as mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, \n{K0500787.2}  4 \n\nautism. intem1ittent explosive disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and a severe behavior \ndisorder.  The JRC clients have caused life-threatening injury to themselves and pennanent \ndisfigurement through their uncontrollable behaYiors such as head banging, eye gouging, tearing \ntheir own flesh, biting off body parts, pulling out their own adult teeth, destroying furniture and \nschool equipment, punching their fists tlu·ough glass windows, running into traffic, jumping out \nof windows, and violently attacking family n1embers, teachers, staff and others with punches, \nkicks. bites and sharp objects such as razor blades and eating utensils. \nThe JRC clients come to JRC from some of the best treatment facilities in the nation \nwhere they could not be effectively treated v.ith all forms of treatment, including psychotherapy, \npositive behaYior supports and massive dosages and combinations (cocktails) of powerful anti-\npsychotic medication which have dangerous and sometimes pennanent side-effects such as \nmajor weight gain. severe sedation, acute and chronic extrapyramidal syndromes (e.g., tardive \ndyskinesia, akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, sexual \ndysfunction. prolactin elevation, sudden cardiac death, nocturnal enuresis, addiction, increased \nlikelihood of diabetes, and/or life-shortening metabolic changes.  New clients continue to arrive \nat JRC severely injured and in immense pain from their self-mutilation and v,,itbout any prospect \nfor education or rehabilitation because they are so heavily sedated and in a near comatose state \nfrom the cocktails of anti-psychotic drugs that their previous programs prescribed for them \nbecause the program could not stop their dangerous behaviors. \nJRC successfully treats these unfortunate, desperate people with its intensive behavioral \ntreaunent progran1 both without aversive intef\\.·entions and. when necessary, -with aversive \ninterventions as approved by a Massachusetts Probate and Family Court, utilizing the substituted \n{K0500767.2l  5 \n\njudgment criteria set forth in the Consent Decree.  JRC's treatment and education program often \nacts as a placement oflast resort for children and adults with severe behavior disorders who have \nbeen resistant to all other forms of psychological and psychiatric treatment, including the \nprescription of anti psychotic medications.  Clients are sent to JRC by school districts and state \nagencies v. hen the client cannot be effectively treated and educated by other programs, including \nresidential schools (such as the May Institute and the New England Center for Children) and \npsychiatric hospitals (such as Bellevue Hospital and McLean Hospital).  Impartial Hearing \nOfficers appointed to bear special education appeals pursuant to the federal Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act continue to order that the aversive interventions used at JRC be \nincluded in the clients' individualized education programs. \nDefendant DDS itself places and funds thirty-eight clients at JRC.  Twenty-seven of these \nclients receive treatment with aversive inventions as approved by the Massachusetts Probate and \nFamily Cou1t.  Other programs in Massachusclts (including DDS-operated facilities) were unable \nto effectively treat their behavior disorders and keep them safe from harm. In over eighty cases \neach year. the Probate and Family Courts of Bristol, Norfolk, and Suffolk Counties enter \nsubstituted judgment orders and findings authorizing the use of aversive interventions for JRC \nclients and specificaUy find that the aversive interventions are highly effective, safe and are the \nleast restricti,·e treatment available to save the client from severe and permanent harm. \nAlthough the Consent Decree allows DDS to intervene in the JRC substituted judgment \nproceedings, it has not offered any evidence in any of the proceedings that positive behavior \nsupports or any other treatment would be an effective alternative. or that aversive interventions \nare not the least restrictive treatment.  On the contrary, as required by the Consent Decree, DDS \n[ K0500787.2 J  6 \n\nhires independent psychologists to evaluate the JRC clients receiving aversive interventions \nevery three years who consistentJy report that the clients continue to need the aversive treatment. \nB.  History of the Litigation and Purposes now Served by the Consent Decree \nDefendants' first argument for modification of the Consent Decree is that it should be \ndisbanded entirely because its \"purpose has been fulfilled.\" At the hearing on March 27, 2013, \nDefendants suggested that this issue could be decided in their favor on the basis of facts already \nin the record.  But a review of the record shows two purposes for the Consent Decree: to ensure \nthat JRC is able to proYide necessary treatment to its clients on an ongoing basis, and to protect \nPlaintiffs from future acts of bad faith. Both purposes remain relevant and important, and \nrequire discovery before any proposed modification. \nDefendants argue, essentially, that the Consent Decree is \"fulfilled\" because: its sole \npurpose was to \"remedy\" JRC for \"discrete acts\" by OFC and DMR taken prior to the 1986 \nlawsuit; this remediation was intended to last approximately one year; and the Consent Decree \nwas extended iJ.1 1988 solely so that JRC could be licensed.  Once licensing was completed in \n1989, Defendants conclude, the Consent Decree was at an end; \"[t]his Court did not, and could \nnot, alter the parties' intent by extending the decree 'until ... further order.\"' Defendants' \nMemorandum of Law in Support of Motion w1der Probate and Family Court Rule 60 and Mass. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) to Vacate Consent Decree (\"Memorandum\") at 20. \nIt would be remarkable if, as Defendants suggest, this Court had entered a finding of \ncontempt in 1995 based on a consent decree that ended by its terms in 1989.  And indeed that is \nnot the case.  Prior rulings by this Court and the SJC - and Defendants' own recent stipulations \n- make clear that the Consent Decree remains valid and continues to serve its purposes. \n(KOSOQ787.2)  7 \n\n1.  Complaint. \nThe 1986 complaint in this case alleged that Defendants had acted in bad faith by \nprecipitously forbidding aversive behavioral therapy at JRC without medical basis. and thereby \nendangered the clients' lives and safety.  See Third Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") at 11-14, \nattached hereto at Exhibit 2 (without exhibits).  The Complaint asserted distinct claims both \nsubstantively for a 1ight to effective treatment and education and procedurally for a right to \n2 \ngood-faith regulation. Complaint at 37-46.\n2.  Preliminary Injunction. \nA Request for Preliminary Injunction accompanied the Complaint. This Court held a \nlengthy evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs Request for Preliminary Iojunction and, on June 4, \n1986, granted Plaintiffs a preliminary injunction (enjoining OFC from ordering the termination \nof operations of JRC's treatment facilities, and prohibiting OFC from banning the use of aversive \ninterventions that bad already been authorized for use with five JRC clients by substituted \njudgment orders of this Court), focusing primarily on Plaintiffs' demonstrated need for aversive \ntreatment and the lack of scientific support for Defendants' regulatory actions.  The Court found \nthat JRC's overall tTeatment was \"vastly superior to any other known program for this particular \npopulation,\" and that aversive interventions were used onJy when they were the least restrictive \nmeans of treatment that allowed JRC clients to have a dramatically improved quality oflife. See \nJune 4, 1986 Findings in Support of Preliminary Injunctive Relief (Rotenberg, J.) (\"Findings in \nSupp. of Prel. lnj.\"), attached hereto at Exhibit 3, at 12-15.3  The orders of the Commissioner of \n2 Tn particular. the Complaint alleged that Defendants violated both constitutional and statutory rights of JRC and its \nclients, including Amcles X, XI and XII of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and statuLol) educational rights \npursuant to G. L. c. 71 B and 28A. \n3 The Court wrote that the improvement allowed only by aversives was \"so basic and essential to lthe students] that \nit literally iovolves their opportunity to e1tjoy blessings of humanity that other individuals are likely to take for \ngranted.\"  Findings in Supp. of Prel. lnj. at 15. \n( KOS007 87 .2}  8 \n\nOFC to cease aversive interventions were \"in effect, treatment decisions\" without medical \nfoundation, causing serious practical harm. 4  Id at 16 (emphasis in original).  Defendants had \nthen altered their own internal docwnents and appointed an intentionally biased panel to \nretroactively justify their decisions.  Id. at 23-27.5  The Court's extensive Findings included \nmany findings of bad faith conduct including a finding that OFC wanted to ban aversive \ninterventions but had not offered \"one scintilla of affirmative evidence\" at the five substituted \njudgment trials conducted by the Comi thus far \"even though the agency [OFC] was requested \nby the Court to produce any reasonable available alternative or less intrusive treatment that might \nbe adopted.\" Id at 4. \n3.  Settlement Agreement and Consent Decree. \nIn December of 1986 the parties executed a settlement agreement, providing in most \nsubstantial part that JRC would continue to develop treatment plans for clients based on the least \nrestrictive treatments appropriate; that where those plans called for aversive therapy and the \nclient lacked capacity, this Cowt would review the evidence showing that aversive therapy was \nthe least intrusive method available, and approve or reject the plan with input from Defendants; \nand that the Court would monitor those treatment plans on an ongoing basis.  See Consent \nDecree, attached hereto at Exhibit 4, Part A.  The parties' settlement agreement specifically \nand \nallowed for JRC's continued use of aversive interventions with current and \"new\" clients, \nthis right was specifically intended to be a permanent guarantee; paragraph K of the parties' \n'The Court found that the Commissioner ofOFC\"s treatment decisions were \"arbitrary, capricious and beyond the \nscope of her authority.\"  Findings in Supp. of Pre!. lnj. at 2?-28 (\"By ... [the Commissioner's] own testimony she is \nnot permined to make treatment decisions\"). \n3 In particular, counsel for Defendants had \"deliberate(ly] attempt(ed] to alter a document'\" a comprehensive review \nof JRC  's program that was \"laudatory to [JRC) in all substantial respects[.]\" Findings in Supp. of Pre!. lnj. at 23-24. \nThis Court observed that the Director of the Office For Children had never met those children \"whose lives she \naffects with the stroke of a pen,'\" and that her orders '\"play[ed] Russian Roulette' with the lives and safety of the \nstudents[.]\" Id. at 15, 27. \n!K0500787.2}  9 \n\nsettlement agreement states: \"Upon termination of this agreement, BRI shall continue to employ \nsubstitutedjudgment procedures as ordered by the cou1t.\"6  See id, Parts A(4), A(5), K.7 \nThis Cou1t made the parties' settlement agreement an Order of the Court and \nincorporated the terms into the Consent Decree, holding that the parties' settlement agreement \nensured that the treatments would be safe, effective, professionally acceptable, and extensively \nsupervised.  See Janllary 7, 1987 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in Support of \nApproval of Settlement Agreement Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 23(c) (Rotenberg, J.) (\"Findings \n8 \nin Support\"), attached hereto at Exhibit 5, at 3. Eighteen months later, this Court ordered that \nthe Consent Decree would remain in effect until further order. without objection of any party. \nSee July 7, 1988 Order (Rotenberg, J.),  attached hereto at Exhibit 6. \n4.  Contempt Action. \nIn 1993, Plaintiffs filed a contempt action alleging that Defendants were in violation of \nthe Consent Decree.  This Court agreed, finding that Defendants, motivated by negative media \nattention and unable to ban aversive interventions directly, had embarked on a wide-ranging \ncampaign seeking to put JRC out of business.  See October 6, 1995 Findings of Pact (LaStaiti, J.) \n(\"Findings of Fact\"), a true and accurate copy of which is attached hereto at Exhibit 7, at 18. \n6 In this respect, the Settlement Agreement was intended lo be consistent with Massachusetts law on the process for \nsecuring exrraordinary but necessary treatment for those who are incapacitated, wherein a court, not an executive \nagency. maintains responsibility for authorizing such treannent by detem1ining whether the incapacitated person \nwould consent to the treatment ifs/he had capacity to do so. See Rogers'\" Comm ·r ofD  ep 't ofM  emal Health, 390 \nMass. 489, SOO (1983). \n7 In addition, the Settlement Agreement required Defendants to act in good faith in their regulatory dealings with \nJRC. See Settlement Agreement. Pa11 L.  Moreover, the Settlement Agreement imposed dispute resolution \nobligations on the parties so that disputes could be resolved quickly by those who are familiar with the pa1ties and \nthe complicated issues that may arise, to avoid potentially itTeparable bann to the severely disabled people that rely \non aversive treatment for their very existence. See Consent Decree, Pan B(2). \ns The Court also observed that the settlement avoided some 60 days of hearings that would be required to conduct a \ntrial, with substantial expense to all parties. Findings in Suppon at 2.  As to a single client who objected, the Court \nobserved that his \"particular concerns ... will adequately be addressed through the vehicle of the substituted \njudgment procedure:· Jd at 5. \n(K0500787.2)  10 \n\nThis Court found Defendants in contempt of the Consent Decree, finding that DDS \"imposed a \nsevere and essentially constant burden on the JRC staff by having to respond to an unrelenting \nstream of bad faith regulatory demands and other bad faith conduct over twenty-two months.\" \nOctober 6, 1995 Conclusions of Law (LaStaiti, J.) (\"Concl. of Lavi'), attached hereto at Exhibit \n8, at 9; Findings of Fact at 70. Their tactics included once again suppressing or ignoring their \nown repo1is complimentary of JRC, improperly procuring negative reports, spreading false \ninfo1mation, and in attempting to conceal their scheme, \"repeatedly and without hesitation \nl[ying] to this CoUit.\"  Findings of Fact at 43.9  The Court referred two DMR officials for \nprosecution for perjury and criminal contempt (Canel. of Law at 16), and referred the Assistant \nAttorney General representing DMR to the Board of Bar Overseers for endorsing false testimony \nand helping to perpetrate a fraud on the court.  See Findings of Fact at 84-87.  The Court \nenjoined regulatory orders and decisions concerning JRC and appointed a Receiver, among other \npurposes, to ensure \"that DMR will continue to maintain and fulfill its responsibilities in \nsubstantial compliance ... with the Settlement Agreement after the termination of the \nReceivership.\"  Concl. ofLaw at 81, 84; October 5, 1995 Judgment and Order (LaStaiti, J.) \n(\"Judg. and Order\"), attached hereto at Exhibit 9, at 5. \nIn resolving the contempt action this Court construed the purposes of the Consent Decree, \nholding that \"(t]he settlement agreement was designed to protect JRC, the Students and their \n9 More specifically, the Court·f ound that Defendants had suppressed or ignored internal reports (Findings of Fact at \n16, 69); acted in order to avoid negalive media attention rather tlrnn for the welfare of JRC clients (id. at 18); \nengaged in a series ofimproper actions designed to put JRC out of business (id.), including by knowingly or \nrecklessly making false public statements calcuJated to put JRC in a false and negative light (id. at 19, 35, 57); \ndenied the efficacy of JRC's program \"without factual basis and in deliberate ignorance'· of their own records (id at \n20, 27, 36); attempted to intimidate and harass the court monitor (id. at 24); required JRC to make public statements \n\"purposely desig11ed to a!ann funding agencies'\" (id. at 30); acted in total disregard for the concerns expressed by \nparents about the best interests of their children (id. at 31 ); secured an intentionally biased review of JRC and then \nhad the report modified to conceal its bias {id. at 37-39): investigated issues unrelated to their regulatory mission (id. \nat 47): met with officials at other agencies as pan of their \"campaign of interfering with JRC\"s relationship with its \nfunding agencies·· (id. at 60); and in attempting to conceal all of the above, \"repeatedly and withoul hesitation lied to \nthis Court.\" (id. at 43). \n{K0500787.2)  11 \n\nfamilies from future bad faith conduct by state officials while safeguarding the state's interest in \nthe welfare of children.\" Findings of Fact at 5 (emphasis added).  On appeal the SJC, as ultimate \narbiter of the Consent Decree's intent, further clarjfied the two purposes served by the Consent \nDecree: \n111e action that resulted in the settlement agreement was brought \nbecause the parents and guardians of JRC  patients alleged that \nOFC was [1] denying individual patients their constitutional righls \nco certain treatments and [2] was not regulating JRC in goodf aith. \nThe settlement agreement sought to  remedy this situation while \naJlowing the depaitment to continue to fulfil its statutory duties to \nregulate mental health facilities. \nJudge Rorenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. v. Comm'r oft he Dept. ofM  ental RetardaJion, 424 Mass. 430, \n450 (1997) (emphasis added). \n5.  Termination of the Receivership and Post-Receivership Years. \nThe receivership lasted more than ten years.  ln 2003, the Receiver recommended \ntrai1Sferring regulatory authority back to DMR and OCCS - not, as Defendants suggest, because \nthe Consent Decree·s purpose had been fulfilled or completed, but to the contrary. because the \n\"protections of the Settlement Agreement concerning aversjve therapy and substituted judgment \nproceedings [would) not be disturbed\" by the transfer.  See May 19, 2003 Special Report of \nReceiver Re Plan for Winding Dov.11 the Receivership, attached hereto at Exhibit 10, at 8.  AlJ of \nthe parties (including Dlv1R and OCCS) stipulated that the Consent Decree wouJd remai11 in \neffect unJess and until one of the parties sought and obtained a \"modification of their \nobligations\" under the decree. See September 4, 2003 Stipulation, attached hereto at Exhibit 11, \nat 2.  The receivership ended in April 2006. \nSince the receivership ended, Defendants have attempted to inte1fcre with Court-\napproved aversive treatment at JRC and have violated the Consent Decree, including, but not \nlimited to: dramatically changing their interpretation of DDS' regulations on the use of aversive \n(li:OS00787.2}  12 \n\ninterventions to make it difficult, if not impossible, for JRC to comply; and amending its \nbehavior modification regulations to ban aversive treatment for those who did not have Court-\napproval for such treatment as of September 1, 2011.10  Also, Defendants have made a series of \narbitrary findings of non-compliance with conditions of JRC's Level III Certification (the \ncertification necessary under DDS' regulations for a facility to administer Level III aversive \ninterventions), thus threatening to restrict Plaintiffs' access to treatment and causing the need for \narb-itration under the Consent Decree in 2011 and2012. \nOn February 14, 2013, Defendants served JRC11 with Defendants' Motion under Probate \nand Family Court Rule 60 and Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) to Vacate Consent Decree. \nID.  ARGUMEJ\\\"T \nA.  The Consent Decree Remains Legally Effective and Continues to Serve its Purpose \nAs a preliminary matter, Defendants have argued essentially that the Consent Decree \nended by its terms long ago (i.e., was \"fulfilled'') and that it can be dispensed wHh because it no \nlonger serves any purpose.  In light of the above history. Defendants' argument that the Consent \nDecree should have expired in 1989 when JRC was fully licensed, and that \"[t]his Court did not, \nand could not, alter the parties' intent by extending the decree 'until ... fu1tber order[,]\"' is simply \nabsurd.  The Court did in fact e>.1end the decree until further order without objection of any \nparty.  The Court then enforced the order in a contempt action filed in 1993, and was upheld by \nthe SJC in 1997, without objection that the decree should have expired.  Defendants then \nstipulated as a condition of tenninating the receivership that the decree remained in effect in \nio DDS djd not seek to modify, clarify or dissolve the Consent Decree before amending the behavior modification \nregulations. \n11 Defendants did not serve the other parties until on or about March 15, 2013. \n{K05007S7.2)  13 \n\n2003i and that it would remain in effect until \"modification.\"  See September 4, 2003 Stipulation \n(LaStaiti, J.) at 2. \nIt is thus clear, as law of the case, that the Consent Decree remains lawfully in effect and \nwill remain so until modified; it has not ceased operation by its ten11S.  Nor bas it ceased to serve \nits purpose.  It continues to thls day to serve the two purposes identified by the SJC - purposes \nvery different from the sole purpose retroactively suggested by Defendants. \nFirst. the Consent Decree continues to ensure that individual patients are not \"den(ied) ... \ntheir constitutional rights to certain treatments,\" Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc., 424 Mass. at \n450, treatments which allow them \"to enjoy blessings of humanity that other individuals are \nlikely to take for granted.\"  Findings in Supp. of Prel. Inj. at 15.  In over eighty cases each year, \nthe Probate and Family Courts of Bristo~ Norfolk, and Suffolk Counties enter substituted \njudgment orders and findings authorizing the use of aversive interventions for JRC clients and \nspecifically find that the aversive interventions are highly effective, safe and are the least \nrestrictive treatment available to save the client from severe and pennanent hann. \nSecond, the Consent Decree continues, in the words of this Court, to \"protect JRC, the \nStudents and their families from future bad faith conduct by state officials[.)\" Findings of Fact at \n5 (emphasis added).  In both 1986 and 1995, this Court discovered that Defendants had sought to \nban aversive treatment at JRC on facially valid pretexts, but against the medical evidence, the \nbest interests of the ciienlc; and in defiance of their own internal documents, for undisclosed \nreasons and by biased and bad faith means.  Now, just six years after regaining full regulatory \nauthority, Defendants are yet again seeking to ban aversive treatment at JRC, again despite the \nreports of their Q\\.vn independent clinicians (and the yearly findings of the Probate and Family \nCourts) that the treatment remains necessary and ethical.  It is hard to fathom from the facts \n{K  05007Si.2 J  14 \n\nalready in the record how Defendants can argue that the Consent Decree no longer serves its \npurpose of protecting Plainti ITs from Defendants' bad faith regulation. \nIn sum, both of the Consent Decree's purposes recognized by the SJC - ensuring \nPlaintiffs' access to treatment they require, and restraining bad faith conduct by Dcfendants-\nremain in effect and remain important.  If Defendants Vlish to abolish the Consent Decree instead \nof working within its terms. they cannot rely on their narrow reading of this Court's 1988 order. \nThey must meet the standard set in Rufo v. Inmates ofS uffolk Cnty. Jail to show that a substantial \nchange in circumstances warrants such a modification.  502 U.S. 367 (1992).  We therefore turn \nto that standard. \nB.  Standard of Review \n\"Consent decrees have elements of both contracts and judicial decrees.\"  Frew ex rel. \nFrew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004).  \"A consent decree 'embodies an agreement of the \nparties' and is also 'an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be \nenforceable as, ajucticial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other \njudgments and decrees.\"' Id., quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378.  \"[AJ party seeking modification of \na consent decree bears the burden of establishing [1] that a significant change in circumstances \n[2] warrants reYision of the decree.  If the moving party meets this standard, the court should \nconsider [3] \\Vhether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" \nRufo, 502 U.S. at 383. \nAs to the first element, \"[a] party seeking modification of a consent decree may meet its \ninitial burden by sho'Aing either a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" Id. at \n384.  The change must be unanticipated; \"modification should not be granted where a party relies \nupon events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree.\" Id. at 385. \n(K0500787.2)  15 \n\nAs to the second eleme11t, the party seeking a modification must show that the significant \nchange it has identified warrants modification. \"Modification of a consent decree may be \nwarranted when changed factual conditions make compliance v.rith the decree substantially more \nonerous[,] ... when a decree proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles, ... or \nwhen enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public \ninterest[.]\" Id. at 384 (citations omitted). \nAs to the third element, \"[o)nce a moving party has met its burden of establishing either a \nchange in fact or in law warranting modification of a consent decree, the [court] should \ndetermine whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" \nId. at 391.  \"Of comse, a modification must not create or perpetuate a constitutional violation.\" \nId. at 391.  And it must not deprive the parties of the benefit of their bargain by rewriting the \nconsent decree \"so that it conforms to the constitutional floor. ... (T]he focus should be on \nwhether the proposed modification is tailored to resolve the problems created by the change in \ncircumstances.  A court should do no more, for a consent decree is a final judgment that may be \nreopened only to the extent that equity requires.\"  Id at 391. \nAdopting Rufo in Massachusetts, the Appeals Court observed that it is a \"flexible \nstandard. . based on \"the umbrella concept of 'equitable'[.]\" Mitchell v. Mitchell, 62 Mass. App. \nCt. 769, 779 (2005), quoting Alexis Lichine & Cie. v. Sacha A. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., 45 \nF.3d 582, 586 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"[F]actors to be considered in determining whether there is a \n'significant change in circumstances' vary ·with type of case and whether complete dissolution of \nan injunction is sought or only a modification; 'if a party seeks to have a decree set aside \ne11tirely, he or she has to show that the decree has served its purpose, and there is no longer any \nneed for the injunction[.)\"\" Id, quoting Moore's Federal Practice § 60.47(2)(c) (2004).  \"Tue \n{K0500787.2}  16 \n\ngreater the likelihood that the safety of the protected party may be put at risk by a modification, \nthe more substantial the showing the party seeking relief must make.\" Id at 780.

Comm 'r of Massachusetts Dep 't ofP ub. \nWelfare, 692 F.2d 790, 800 n.13 (lst Cir. 1982). \nC.  Factual Issues in Dispute \nUnder Rufo, Defendants must prove: first, that there bas been a significant, unexpected \nchange of circumstances since entry of the Consent Decree; second, that the changes warrant \nmodification; and third, that their proposed modification is suitably tailored to remedy the \nproblems caused by the change.  Since Defendants seek complete vacatur of the Consent Decree \nwhich was entered for the safety of Plaintiffs in this action, Defendants will have to prove by \nclear and convincing evidence that the Consent Decree is no longer needed to protect Plaintiffs \nfrom harm. At a minimum, that standard raises the following contested factual issues: \n1.  ·whether the Purposes of the Consent Decree Have Been Fulfilled. \nAs explained above, Plaintiffs believe that the procedural record is dispositive on this \nissue.  To the extend the Court disagrees, Plaintiffs are entitled to factual discovery as to the \npurposes of the Consent Decree and whether they have been fulfilled. \n{K0500787.2}  17 \n\n2.  Whether Defendants Have Regulated JRC in Good Faith, and Whether \nPlaintiffs Are Still at Risk of Harm from Future Bad Faith Conduct. \nA major issue is whether Defendants, as they claim, ha\"e regulated JRC in good faith \nsince regaining receivership, and can be expected to continue doing so such that the Consent \nDecree's purpose of preventing \"future bad faith conduct\" is no\\v superfluous. 12 \nPlaintiffs dispute, among others, Defendants' factual claims that Plaintiffs are no longer \nat risk of serious or irreparable harm from Defendants denying Plaintiffs access to effective \ntreatment and other bad faith actions of Defendants~ that Defendants have treated Plaintiffs with \nfairness and such treatment has been transparent since the end of the receivership; and that \nPlaintiffs can adequately protect their rights through the existing administrative appeals process. \nGiven the variety and ingenuity of Defendants' previous bad faith conduct, and their elaborate \nattempts to conceal that conduct from this Court, Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery to test \nDefendants' present representations of good faith. As a partial list, Plaintiffs will seek document \ndiscovery and depositions regarding Defendants': internal communications, decision-making \nprocess. and future plans in regulating JRC: draft and final reviews of JRC programs: selection \nof teams to conduct such reviews; findings of independent psychologists retained by DDS and \nthe disposition of said findings; changes in policy toward JRC and aversive interventions after \ntermination of the receivership; findings and decisions alleging that JRC is not in complete \ncompliance with conditions of Level Ill Certification and threats to deny Level III Certification; \nand communications with other regulatory bodies, private entities, indlviduals, and media \norganizations. \n12 Defendants allege as separate change in circwnstances that they themselves have passed a regulation banning \naversives.  Memorandum at 25. This is primarily a legal argument, and one which the S.IC has rejected. See Judge \nRotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc., 424 Mass. at 447 {a judge's order \"cannot be unilaterally overridden by an executive \nagency'').  Facwally speaking, the argument is subsumed in the question of whether Defendants have regulated in \ngood faith. \n{K0500787 2 l  18 \n\n3.  Whether the State of Scientific Know] edge Has Shifted such that Substituted \nJudgment Proceedings Are Never Necessary to Ensure Plaintiffs' Access to \nEffective Treatment such as Aversive Interventions. \nThe ne>.1 factual question is whether there has been a significant, unanticipated change in \nthe state of scientific knowledge as to treatment of disabled clients, such that it will never be \nappropriate for the Probate and Family Court to consider by means of a substituted judgment \nproceeding whether a particular client requires aversive treatment. \nPlaintiffs dispute, among others, Defendants' factual claims that aversive interventions \nare professionalJy um1cccssary and unethical and do not conf01m to the cw-rent standard of care; \nthat positive behavior supports is the generally accepted standard of care in the relevant \ntreatment community; that there are effective alternative treatments for all people with severe \nbe1rnvior disorders; that other programs do not use aversive interventions to treat severe behavior \ndisorders in people with developmental disabilities; and that DDS has identified serious issues \nrelated to JRCs use of aversive interventions since the receivership ended.  To the contrary, \nPlaintiffs anticipate the evidence wilJ show that the standard of care remains essentially the same \nnow as it was in 1986: the least restrictive means of treatment should be used for each individual; \nthe best available positive interventions should be tried before any aversive interventions; and if \npositive interventions fail, it is appropriate to consider more restrictive alternatives including \naversive interventions.  \\\\'hile the particular treatments available have changed, that change was \nnot unanticipated, and the overall framework for selecting a treatment remains the same. \nRegarding the particular individuals in this case, Plaintiffs anticipate discovery will show \nthat they remain at risk of serious and/or irreparable harm from a loss of effective treatment if \naversive interventions are denied. and that aversive interventions remain their least restrictive \nmeans of treatment for cases of severe behavior disorders. as has been found each year by the \nIK0500787.2}  19 \n\ncourts.  Importantly, discovery will include the findings of the independent psychologists \nretained by DDS to evaluate m..c clients as to U1eir need for aversive treatments. \n4.  \\Vhetber there Have Been Any Other Substantial Changes of Circumstance. \nThough Defendants have not articulated the relevance to their motion, the affidavit of \nCommissioner Howe includes a wide variety of factual allegations, such as alleged \ncommunications with the Department of Justice and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices.  Plaintiffs dispute many of the facts attached to Defendants' motion but not directly \nrelied on in their Memorandum; to the extent Defendants intend to rely on those allegations, \nPlaintiffs are entitled to investigate through discovery. \n5.  Whether Any Changes that Ha,,e Occurred Make the Consent Decree \nSubstantially More Onerous, Unworkable Because of Unforeseen Obstacles, \nor Detrimental to the Public Interest; and if so, Whether Dismissal of the \nConsent Decree is Suitably Tailored to Correct the Problem. \nThe final factual issue is whether any changes demonstrated by Defendants actually make \nthe current operation of the Consent Decree \"substantially more onerous,\" \"unworkable because \nof unforeseen obstacles,\" or \"detrimental to the public interest\"; and if so, whether termination of \nthe decree is a suitably tailored remedy. \nPlaintiffs dispute, among others, Defendants' factual allegations that the Consent Decree \nhampers DDS· efforts to regulate JRC or constrains DDS from ensuring that JRC is employing \nthe least restrictive, most effective treatment.  Factual questions releYant to this jssue include, \nwithout limitation: whether any changes in the state of scientific knowledge regarding treatment \nof disabled clients can be adequately addressed by Defendants' participation in the substituted \njudgment proceedings pursuant to the Consent Decree; why Defendants have not availed \nthemselves of the ability to participate in those proceedings before moving to dismiss the decree; \nwhether U1e decree interferes with Defendants' ability to regulate JRC as a general matter~ \n20 \n{K0500787 2} \n\ndespite the SJC  's finding that substituted judgment proceedings did not interfere with \nDefendants' general regulatory duties; and the nature of any obstacles allegedly in1posed on \nDefendants by federal agencies. \n6.  The Factual Allegations in the Memorandum and the Affidavits of Gary W. \nLa Vigna, Ph.D., BDBA-D and Elin M. Howe. \nFinally (to the extent they are not covered above), Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery \nregarding the var1ous facts alleged in Defendants' Memorandum and voluminous affidavits, on \nwhich Defendants presumably intend to rely in this proceeding. \nIV.  PROPOSED DISCOVERY ORDER \nA.  Scope of Discovery \nIn light of the above, any piecemeal approach to discovery in this case will be \ncounterproductive. The Court will not be able to rule on Defendants' motion under Rufo 's \nequitable standard without considering issues such as Plaintiffs' ongoing need for aversive \ntreatment; the ongoing risk to Plaintiffs of Defendants' bad faith regulation; and the practical \nregulatory issues, if any, which the decree might be modified to address.  (Indeed, Defendants \nwould hardly have bothered to preemptively prepare and file \"expert\" affidavits totaling over \n1200 pages to address those contested issues if they believed the issues could be avoided.) In \naddition, given the likelihood of appeal by one party or the other. it is also prudent to decide the \ncase on a full record. \nPlaintiffs propose that discovery be conducted according to the Civil Rules without \nfurther limitation at this time, a procedure consistent with the law in Massachusetts and other \njurisdictions. 13  It is too early, for example, to limit discovery to particular documents or \n13 Trial courts in Massachusetts routinely allow meaningful discovery in such matters.  See e.g. Bilingual Master \nParents Advisory Counsel v. Boston Sch. Comm., 14 Mass. L. Rep. 612 (Mass. Super. CL 2002) (Gants, J.) (trial \ncourt orders discove!}' in action regarding consent decree in bilingual education); Mass. Port Auth. v. Ciry of \nI K0500787.2 l  21 \n\ndepositions of named individuals.  The pai1icular documents and witnesses necessary to address \nthe above questions wil1 emerge only through initial discovery.  Nor is a narrow definition \nnecessary to orderly resolution of this case; any party can of course seek protection from \ndiscovery that is i1Televant, overbroad, or abusive in the ordinary course of civil procedure. If \nthe Court is inclined to define the scope of discovery at this stage beyond what is already defined \nby the Ci,·il Rules, then the scope of discovery is best outlined as follows, and is included in the \nProposed Order for Discovery in the alternative: \n1.  Whether the purposes of the Consent Decree have been fulfilled; \n2.  Whether Defendants have regulated JRC in good faith, and whether Plaintiffs are \nstill at risk of harm from future bad faith conduct; \n3.  Whether the stare of scientific knowledge has shifted such that substituted \njudgment proceedings are never necessary to ensure Plaintiffs' access to effective \ntreatment such as aversive interventions; \n4.  Whether there have been any other substantial changes of circumstance; \n5.  Whether any changes that have occun-cd make the Consent Decree substantially \nmore onerous, unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles, or detrimental to the \npublic interest; \n6.  Whether dismissal of the Consent Decree is suitably tailored to correct any such \nproblems; and \n7.  The factual allegations in the Memorandum and the Affidavits of Gary W. \nLaV  igna, Ph.D., BCBA-D and Elin M. Howe. \nBoston, 17 Mass. L. Rep. 125 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2003) (court ordered discovery in plaintiff's motion to vacate \npermanent injunction)  Courts throughout the nation routinely allow such discovery as well. See, e.g., John B. v. \nGoer:, 20 I 0 U.S. App. LEXIS 25589 (6th Cir. 2010) (trial court allows discovery in action against consent decree): \nGon=alez v. Galvin, 151 FJd 526 (6th Cir. 1998) (court reverses vacatur of consent decree where affidavits alone \nwere insufficient to provide requisite factual record); U.S. v. Montrose, 980 F. Supp. 1112 (C.D. Cal. 1997) (parties \nentitled to broad factual discovery, including \"matters underlying the Amended Consent Decree\"). \n22 \n(KOS00787.2} \n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI, DeYorah A.

The Commissioner's Actions, as Found by the\nCourt, Do Not Constitute Contempt of the\nProvision of the Settlement Agreement Prohibiting\nBRI's Intake of New Clients from Being\n\"Impermissibly Obstructed.\" 51\nE, The Commissioner's Actions, as Found by the\nCourt, Do Not Constitute Contempt of the Good\nFaith Provision of the Settlement Agreement. 53\nlo The Good Faith Provision Is Too Ambiguous\nto Form the Basis for Contempt Findings or\nSanctions. 53\nt The Court Impermissibly Shifted the Burden\nof Proof onto the Commissioner to Prove HIS\nGood Faith. 58\n3. The Court's Findings of Subjective \"Bad\nFaith,\" Even If True, Are Insufficient, As a\nMatter of Law, to Constitute A \"Direct\" and\n\"Undoubted\" Violation of the Good Faith\nProvision of the Settlement Agreement. 6O\nlI. TIIROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL, THE TRIAL\nCOURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN RULING ON\nEVIDENTIARY ISSUES, TOTHESUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF\nTHE COMMISSIONER. 62\n\niv\nAt The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in Allowing\nBRI to Present Evidence as to BRI's Financial\nCondition, After BRI Failed to Produce Anyone\nwith Knowledge of This Subject in Response to the\nCommissioner's Rule 30(b)(6) Deposition Notice. 62\nBI The Court Abused Its Discretion in Excluding\nEvidence that Should Have Been Admitted Under\nthe Curative Admissibility Doctrine. 66\nIlL THE TRIAL COURT'S FACTUAL\nFINDINGS----INCLUDING FINDINGS OF BAD FAITH,\nPERJURY, AND ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT_WHICH\nARE ADOPTED ALMOST VERBATIM FROM BRI*S\nPROPOSED FINDINGS AND ARE ENTIRELY\nUNSUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE, ARE CLEARLY\nERRONEOUS. 7O\nA. This Court Should Strictly Scrutinize the Trial\nCourt's Factual Findings to Ensure that They Are\nSupported by the Evidence in the Record. 7O\nIi Where, as Here, the Trial Court's Factual\nFindings Are Taken Almost Verbatim from\nthe Prevailing ParO,'s Proposed Findings,\nthe Appellate Court Must Scrutinize the\nEntire Record with Particular Care. 70\n2.

DMR Had a Good Faith Basis for Seeking\nInformation about the Court Monitor's\nFinancial Relationships with BRI's\nAttorneys and Their Clients. 90\n6. The Commissioner's Account of His 1991\nTelephone Conversation with Henry Clark\nWas Neither \"Blatantly False\" nor\nIntentionally Untruthful 93\n7. The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor HIS Letter of August 31, 1993,\nConditionally Certifying BR1 to Use Level\nII1 A versives. 94\n8. The Commissioner Acted Responsibly in\nKeeping Out-Of-State Agencies and Parents\nof BRl Students Apprised of the Certification\nProcess. 105\n9. DMR's Report to the Court on the Status of\nBRI's Application for Certification Was\nNeither False nor Misleading. 109\n\nvi\n10. The Commissioner Had a Good-Faith Basis\nfor Appointing Gunnar Dybwad to BRi's\nHuman Rights Committee and Did Not\nRefuse to Mediate This Issue. 111\n11. The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor the Statements Contained in His\nCertification Letter of September 24, 1993. 112\n12.

The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor the Statements Contained in His\nCertification Letter of December 15, 1993. 130\n15. There Is No Evidence that DMR's\nCommunications with New York State\nAgencies in February 1994 Caused New\nYork State to Remove Any Clients from\nBRI. 132\n16. The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor Imposing the Conditions Contained in\nHis Certification Letter of Februa O, 9,\n1994. 134\n17.

The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor Imposing the Conditions Contained in\nHis Certification Letter of January 20, 1995,\nand for Decertifying BRI for Refusing to\nComply with Those Conditions. 139\n19. DMR Dealt Fairly with BR1 on Contract\nIssues. 143\n20. The Commissioner Acted Reasonably in\nGiving BR1 Additional Time to Correct\nDeficiencies Identified by a Licensing\nSurvey 145\n21. The Court's Findings Grossly Overstate the\nEvidence of Harm to BRI and Its Students. 146\nIV. THE EXTRAORDINARY RELIEF GRANTED BY THE\nT_AL COURT Is UNJUST AS AMATTER OF EQUITY\nANDIMPROPER ASAMATTER OFLAW. 149\nA. In Issuing the Receivership Orders and Other\nBroad-Ranging Injunctive Relief, the Trial Court\nAbused Its Dbcretion, Exceeded Its Authority, and\nImpermissibly Intruded on the Powers of the\nLegislative and Executive Branches. 150\nThe Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in\n1\nImposing the Drastic Remedy of\nReceivership on the Facts of This Case. 150\n2. The Plenary Powers Granted to the Receiver\nin This Case Are Overly Broad,\nUnconstitutional, and in Conflict with\nVarious Statutory Provisions. 155\n\nviii\n3. The Trial Court's Overly Broad Injunctive\nOrders Fail to Conform to the Requirements\nof Mass. R. Civ. P. 65(d). 159\n4.

Whether the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the\nCommissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR\"), in\nexercising his statutory and regulatory authority over the Behavior Research\nInstitute (\"BRI\"), l clearly and directly violated unequivocal provisions of a\nSettlement Agreement entered as a court order in this case in 1987.\n2. Whether all of the trial court's factual findings--including findings\nof bad faith, perjury, and attorney misconduct--which are adopted almost\nverbatim from BRI's proposed findings and are entirely unsupported by the\nevidence, are clearly erroneous.\n3. Whether the trial court abused its discretion and intruded\nimpermissibly on the prerogatives of the executive and legislative branches\nin appointing a receiver to assume all of DMR's regulatory authority over\nBILl as well as other powers and immunities that exceed those of DMR and\nof the court itself.\n4. Whether the trial court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of\nlaw in awarding over $1 million in attorneys' fees, without giving the\nCommissioner an opportunity to review and respond to the fee applicants'\ncontemporaneous time records, and without making specific and detailed\nfindings as to the reasonableness of the time spent or the expenses incurred\nby the 25 attorneys and paraiegals for whose services fees were awarded.\nfin the fall of 1994, the plaintiff, formerly known as Behavior Research Institute\n(\"BRI') changed its name to the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (\"JRC\"). However,\nto avoid confusion, it isreferred to throughout as \"BRI.\"\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the trial court holding the\nCommissioner of Mental Retardation in contempt of a 10-year-old Settlement\nAgreement, entered as an order of the trial court, which was intended to\nresolve then-pending litigation between BRI and the Office for Children\n(\"OFC\"). The contempt litigation itself is the culmination of a two-year\ncontroversy as to whether DMR should continue to certi_, BRI to utilize\ncertain highly intrusive behavior modification procedures and, if so, under\nwhat conditions. To put the issues presented by this appeal in context, it is\nnecessary to describe the ten-year history of the relationship between DMR\nand BRI, both in court and out, in some detail.\nPrior Proceedings\n1. The Underlying Case\nThis case originally arose from a licensing dispute between the Office for\nChildren (\"OFC\") and its licensee, BRI, a private provider of services to\nautistic and mentally retarded young people and adults, in September 1985,\nOFC issued an order to show cause why BRI's license should not be\nsuspended or revoked for failure to comply with OFC regulations. App. 60.\nAt the same time, OFC issued an Emergency Order to Correct Deficiencies,\nwhich required BRI to cease using certain behavior modification procedures\n(i.e., vapor sprays, pinches, slaps, spanks, muscle squeezes, and the\n\"contingent food program\") and to cease intake of new students. Appendix\n(\"App.\") 61.2\n2A three-volume Appendix of pertinent parts of the trial court record is filed herewith,\npursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 18. Also filed herewith, in separately bound volumes, are:\n(1) All trial exhibits (\"Ex.\"). The exhibits are indexed and numbered as\nfollows: Uncontested Exhibits {U- I--U-235) (three volumes), Plaintiffs'\nExhibits (BRI-236--BRI-326, Parent- 1,and GAL- I)(three volumes), and\n(continued...)\n\nOn Febru_' 28, 1986, BRI and two parents of BRI students, who sought\nto represent a class of all students at BRI and their parents and guardians,\nfiled a complaint in the Bristol Probate and Family Court 3seeking to enjoin\nOFC from enforcing its emergency order and from revoking BRI's license\nwithout court approval. App. 52. On June 4, 1986, the trial court issued a\npreliminary injunction, maintaining the status quo pending a trial on the\nmerits. App. 5, 115. A Single Justice of the Appeals Court denied OFC's\npetition for interlocutory relief from that order. 4 App. 109.\n_(...continued)\nDefendant'sExhibits(DMR- I--DMR-80) (twovolumes).\n(2) Theentire trialtranscript (\"Tr.\")(15 volumes).\n(3) An Addendum toArgument I11ofthisbrief. That Addendum isorganized\ninto21sections, corresponding tothe21 subsections of Argument III.B\nof this brief. Each section of the Addendum contains, side-by-side, the\nrelevanttrialcourt fmdings and the corresponding proposed findings of\nBRI,followed bycopies of the pertinent transcriptpagesandexhibits. All\ndocuments reproduced in this Addendum are also contained in the\nAppendix, Exhibits,orTranscriptvolumes listedabove.\n3After OFC contested the Probate Court'sjurisdiction, the then-presiding judge\n(Rotenberg,J.)obtainedanorderspeciallyassigninghimtosit asa SuperiorCourtjudge in\nthiscase. App. 5. AfterJudge Rotenberg's death in 1993, another ProbateCourtjudge\n(LaStaiti, J.) assumed responsibility for the case and was also specially assigned as a\nSuperiorCourtjudge forthatpurpose. App. 19.\n4Noappellate courtever examined the recordunderlying the preliminaryinjunctionor\nruled onthemerits ofthe trialcourt'sfindings of badfaithonthe partofOFC. Cf App. 109\n(Single Justice who denied interlocutoryrelief frompreliminaryinjunctionwas unableto\nread extensive trial courtrecordbefore doing so). Although OFC had filed a notice of\nappeal of the preliminaryinjunctiontoa fullpanelof the AppealsCourt,that appealwas\nvoluntarilydismissed once the Settlement Agreement _vasentered into. App. 5.\n\n4\n2. The Settlement Agreement _\nOn December 12, 1986, after a lengthy period of negotiations, a\nSettlement Agreement was entered into by BRI, OFC, the Director of OFC,\nand counsel for a \"Class of All Students at BRI, Their Parents and\nGuardians,\" App. 133, which class was certified as such that same day. 6\nApp. 118. The Settlement Agreement was approved by the court and entered\nas a court order on January 7, 1987. Ex. U-4.\nAs stated in the Preamble to the Settlement Agreement, its purpose was\nto \"end the litigation\" that was then pending between OFC, BRI, and the\nparents. App. 120-21. By its terms, the Se,'tlement Agreement was to\nterminate automatically after one year, unless the court ordered otherwise,\n\"'for good cause shown related to the terms or substance of th[e] agreement.\"\nApp. 132-33.

During the pendency of the Agreement, the court\nretained jurisdiction over the case, but the rights of the parties were expressly\n\"limited to enforcement of the terms of this agreement.\" App. 132.\nThe Settlement Agreement imposed many obligations on BRI. 7 In return,\nOFC agreed to restore BRI's licenses, to permit intake of new clients, to give\nBRI equal consideration with other private providers in referring new clients\nfor placement at public expense, and to pay $580,605.25 in attorneys' fees.\nApp. 120-33.\nSpecifically, under Part A of the Agreement, BRI is obligated to\nformulate a treatment plan for each client and, where the treatment plan calls\nfor aversive procedures, to obtain the authorization of the Probate Court,\n\"'utilizing the 'substituted judgment' criteria,\" prior to implementing the\ntreatment plan.

App. 132. At the second six-month review, on January 7, 1988,\nthe court extended the Agreement for another six months, based solely on the\nfact that BRI had not yet been licensed by DMH. App. 136.\nEffective July 1, 1987, the responsibility for licensing BRI was\ntransferred, by statute, from DMH to DMR. St. 1986, c. 599. Based on that\nfact and on the fact that DMR was then in the process of considering BRI's\npending application for licensure, DMR (\"as successor to... DMH\") moved\nto amend the Settlement Agreement, on October 24, 1988, to substitute the\nwords \"Department of Mental Retardation\" for the words \"Department of\nMental Health,\" wherever the latter words appear in the Settlement\nAgreement, _ and to modify the requirement concerning the provision of\nclinicians to make it less burdensome to DMR. Ex. U-IO. By order dated\nDecember 29, 1988, the trial court treated DMR's motion to amend as a\nliPart E and other parts of the Agreement not described here have no bearing on the\nissues presented by this appeal.\nL'AIthough BRI relied on PartF inaprevious contempt complaint against DMR and the\nDirector of OFC, App. 138, see subsection 3,infra, BRIdid not claim any violation of this\nprovision in the contempt complaint that gave rise to the present appeal. App. 344, 1212.\n13TheSettlement Agreement referred to only three obligations of DMH (which was not\napart)'tothe Agreement, App. 133): (I) to provide clinicians to assist the Probate Court in\nreviewing treatment plans in the individual guardianship cases, App. 125; (2) to enter into\nan interagency agreement transferring licensing responsibility over BRI from OFC to DMH,\nApp. 127; and (3) to give BRI equal consideration for referrals of new clients. App. 130.\nThe second obligation was discharged by DMH on March 19, 1987, prior to the creation of\nDMR. Ex.

In light\nof this, DMR's General Counsel asked Dr. Daignault's advice \"as to how we\nshould proceed at this point, as it seems appropriate under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement that it now be terminated.\" Ex, U-29. However, to\ndate, no party has formally moved for termination of the Agreement.\n3. Prior Contempt Complaints and Other Litigation\nNo sooner was DMR made a party to the Settlement Agreement, than it\nwas named as a defendant in several successive actions brought by BRI) 6 On\nFebrua-D' 27, 1989, BRI sought a\"preliminary injunction\" from the trial court\n14As will be seen below, the incongruency between what DMR soughtand what the\ncourtallowed isasource ofcontinuingconfusionand disagreement astothescopeof DMR's\nresponsibilities under the Senlement Agreement.\n151nhis answer and motion to dismiss the contempt complaint that gave rise to the\npresent appeal,the Commissioner asserted,asone of 12affirmative defenses, that he \"is not\na properparty tothis case.\" App. 361,486. However, that defense was not pressed inthe\ntrialcourt, App. 374-75 (memorandum insupport of motinn todismiss assumes DMRisa\nparty but reserves the right to raise issue at later time), and is not raised as an issue in\nthe present appeal. See Argument IILB.I, infra.\nlain none of these cases did BEEseekarbitrationof the disputed issues by the court\nmonitor underthe Senlement Agreement prior tofiling itscomplaintsincourt. This pattern\nof conduct by BEE militates against the broad interpretation of the arbitration clause\nadvanced byBEEinthe currentlitigation, requiring arbitration of alldisputes between BEE\nand DMR onany subject. See Argument I.C,infra.\nBEE'ssuccessive actions in 1989 and 1990, alleging bad faith by the previous\nCommissioner of DMR and byother stateagencies, also seriously undermine one of the\ncentral themes of BEE'smost recent contempt complaint and the trial court'sfindings\nthereon--that the regulatory actionstaken byDMRover the pasttwo yearswere motivated\nbyCommissioner Campbell'spersonalbias againstBEE.\n\n9\nin this case (and in the gu_dianship case of David McKnight, a BRI student)\nrequiring DMR to pay BRI for the continued care of Mr. McKnight, App. 15,\nwho had been placed at BRI by another state that was no longer willing to\nfund the placement. In granting the requested relief, the court (Rotenberg, J.)\nrelied, in part, on a finding that DMWs failure to fund this student's\nplacement at BRI constituted a violation of the good faith provision of the\nSettlement Agreement in this case. DMR appealed from that order, and this\nCourt vacated it. In the Matter of McKnight, 406 Mass. 787, 791 (1990)\n(finding \"nothing in th[e] settlement agreement that justified entry of the\npreliminary injunction\").17\nA few months later, on July 7, 1989, while the McKnight appeal was\npending, BRI filed a contempt complaint against DMR and the Director of\nOFC, alleging that they had violated Parts F(2) and L of the Settlement\nAgreement by failing to give BRI equal consideration with other providers\nfor referrals of new clients. App. 138-46. After 15 months of discover)',\nApp. 16-19, BRI did nothing further to prosecute that complaint.\nIn 1990, BRI and the parents of two BRI students sued DMR, three other\nstate agencies, and the Commonwealth in Bristol Probate and Family Court _s\nseeking an order requiring that BRI be reimbursed at the FY 1991 per-student\nrate of $153,351, despite legislation freezing rates for private special\neducation schools at the lower FY 1990 rate. BRI claimed, inter alia, that,\nby refusing to reimburse the school at the higher rate, DMR and the other\nstate agencies were reneging on a settlement of an administrative appeal. The\nProbate Court (Rotenberg, J.) reported the case, and this Court ruled that BRI\n17Onceagain, because thisCourt vacated theorderonother grounds, no appellate court\naddressed the merits ofthe trialcourt's findings of bad faith.\n_SThedefendants contested the Probate Court's jurisdiction over this rate-setting case;\nbut,after the Probate Court reported thecasetothe Appeals Court, this Court granted direct\nappellate re'_iewand resolved themerits ofthe caseindefendants' favorwithout addressing\nthejurisdictional issue.

App. 19. Among the contentions\nin that complaint were allegations that DMR had violated Part B of the\nSettlement Agreement by failing to submit various matters to Dr. Daignault,\nthe court monitor, for arbitration. Shortly thereafter, BR1 noticed a series of\ndepositions, as did DMR? ° App. 20. On October 26, 1993, BRI moved to\namend its contempt complaint, App. 21; and, on November 1, 1993, the court\nallowed that motion and issued a contempt summons. App. 22.\n4. Mediation, 1993-94\nIn the meantime, in August 1993, the attorneys who were then\nrepresenting DMR in tiffs case learned from BRI's attorneys that Dr.\nDaignault, the court monitor, who had been functioning as a mediator in this\ncase, was working with BRI's law firm as a consultant in other, nonspecified,\ncases. Ex. U-85, U-86. Shortly thereafter, DMR's attorneys discovered,\nmore specifically, that Dr. Daignault had prepared affidavits that were filed\nby BRI's law firm on behalf of the fu-m's other clients in another case against\nDMR. Ex. DMR-41. Because this information raised questions as to the\ncourt monitor's neutrality, DMR sought further information from Dr.\nDaignault as to his financial relationships with BRI's attorneys and their other\n19During this same time period, BRI also litigated, as a defendant, its right to restrain\nand treat a student against his will. Because the student was found competent and his\nguardianship was therefore discharged, this Court dismissed the student's appeal in that case\nas moot, v,'ithout addressing the merits. In the Matter ofSturtz, 410 Mass. 58 (I991).\n2°Among the nine depositions noticed by DMR at that time was that of Dr. Daignault,\nEx. U-I II, who took that deposition notice as \"an at'tempt to impugn [him].\" Tr. 11:172.\nSee Argument III.B.5, infra_\n\n11\nclients, first by letter dated August 24, 1993, Ex. U-86, and then by motion.\nApp. 185, 195, 197. Dr. Daignault did not provide the requested information,\nand the court did not act on DMR's motion to require disclosure. '_\nOn September 24, 1993, Dr. Daignault filed a report to the court stating\nthat his efforts to mediate a dispute between BRI and DMR had been\nunsuccessful. Ex. BRI-250. His report contained no decision or\nrecommendation on the matter then in controversy, 22 i.e., DMR's\ncommunications with out-of-state agencies lhnding students at BR1.\nShortly thereafter, on October 22, 1993, \"[i]n order to remove this\ndistraction [i.e., DMR's questions as to his impartiality] from the real issues\nof dispute or concern,\" Dr. Daignault moved that the responsibility \"to\nconduct mediation/arbitration under the Settlement Agreement,\" App. 183,\n184, be assigned to someone else. The court allowed that motion on\nNovember 1, 1993, App. 194, 2_and, by orders dated November 19 and\nDecember 6, 1993, appointed Judge George Hurd, Jr. (ret.) as \"mediator\nunder the settlement agreement,\" in place of Dr. Daignault, and directed the\nparties to submit outstanding issues to him, App. 213, 214, which they did.\nApp. 26-27, 229-53.\n21Byletterdated November 17,1993,DMR requested ahearing onthis motion, butthe\nhearing was continued indefinitely untilsuch timeasDr. Daignault's previously filedrequest\nforcourt-appointed counsel was resolved. Ex. DMR-42. The court eventually granted Dr.\nDaignanlt's request forcourt-appointed counsel on April 13, 1994,but still did not rule on\nDMR'smotion fordisclosure, which wasrenewed byDMR onFebruary21, 1995,App. 272,\nApp. 269, inresponse to Dr. Daignanlt's motion to¢onfwm hisresponsibilities under the\nSettlement Agreement. When DMRlater noticed Dr. Daignanlt'sdeposition inconnection\nwiththe present contempt proceedings, his court-appointed counsel sought and obtained a\nprotective order, barring questions on the subject of his financial relationshipswith BRI's\nattorneys and their other clients. App. 36. In effect, this protective orderconstituted a\ndenial, without a hearing, of DMR's long.pending motion fordisclosure.\n22Cf.Settlement Agreement, Par'.B.¶ 2.

That motion was denied, and discover)' and medialion occurred\nconcurrently through April of 1994. App. 24-26.\n5. Second and Third Amended Contempt Complaints\nOn April 25, 1994, BR1 moved for leave to file a second amended\ncontempt complaint and sought a trial date on that complaint. App. 26.\nDMR opposed BRI's motion foran immediate trial on the grounds, in/eralia,\nthat itwould serve the interests of judicial economy to narrow the issues by\nfurther discovery and by potentially dispositive motions, rather than have a\nlengthy trial on the broad range of legal and factual issues raised by BRI's\nwide-ranging, 41-page proposed complaint. App. 254-60. Neither the\nmotion to amend nor the motion for a trial date was acted upon by the court.\nThe litigation was relatively quiet until March 24, 1995, when BRI filed\na motion for leave to file a third amended contempt complaint and sought a\npreliminary injunction enjoining the Commissioner of DMR from revoking\nBRI's certification to use aversive behavior modification procedures. 24 App.\n32. The proposed third amended complaint alleged, in essence, that the\nCommissioher's decertification decision and the two-year process leading up\nto that decision violated various provisions of the Settlement Agreement.\nApp. 284-355.\n6. The Preliminary Injunction\nThat same day, the court allowed BRI's motion to amend the complaint\nand issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commissioner from:\n24Asdiscussed more fully inthe Statement of Facts, section A.6, infra, the Commissioner\nhad issued a decision the preceding day, March 23, 1995, revoking BRI's certification,\neffective July I, 1995, based on BRI's outright refusal to comply with the conditions\ncontained inhis previous certification decision of January 20, 1995. Ex. U-179.\n\n13\nenforcing decenification of Behavior Research Institute, Inc.\n(sometimes called the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center,\nInc.) as set forth in a letter dated March 23, 1995 provided:\na. that during the terms of this order or any extensions\nthereof, the BRI, alias, shall comply with the\nconditions contained in the Commissioner's letter\ndated January 20, 1995 granting conditionl\ncertification to said BRI, alias; and\nb. that any changes in treatment plans to be made shall\nbe subject to the approval of the Court in a substituted\njudgment proceeding after due notice and an\nopportunity to be heard.\nApp. 283.\nShortly after the issuance of the preliminary injunction, it appeared, from\ncorrespondence between the parties and comments made by the court at a\nsubsequent hearing, that the Commissioner's interpretation of the injunction\nmight differ from that of BRI and, perhaps, that of the court itself. 2_\nTherefore, the Conunissioner attempted to obtain clarification of the\ninjunction by filing a motion to clarify it. App. 356-57. However, by letter\ndated April 18, 1995, the Clerk returned that motion and supporting\nmemorandum to the Commissioner's counsel \"in accordance with Judge\nLaStaiti's request.\" App. 406. The court allowed DMR's subsequent motion\nto require the clerk to docket its motion for clarification, App. 400, 409, but\nnever acted on the motion for clarification itself. 26 In the absence of the\n25The precise issue indispute was whether the preliminary injunction required BRI to\ncomply with all of the conditions in the Commissioner's January 20th letter, including\nparticularly the requirement that BRI cease using the \"specialized fond program,\" a food\ndeprivation program under v.hich a student may receive as little as 20 percent of his daily\ncalorie requirement, depending on his behavior during the day. Ex. U- 166 at 12.\n26Clarification of the preliminary injunction was subsequently provided by a Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court, who modified the preliminary injunction, pending appeal, in\nthe manner requested by the Commissioner inhis petition for relief under G.L.c. 23 I, § II8,\n¶ 1. BRI's appeal from the Single Justice's order modifying the preliminary injunction is\npresently pending before this Court as SJC-07045.\n\n14\nrequested clarification from the trial court, DMR appealed from the\npreliminary injunction, pursuant to G.L.c. 231, § 118, ¶ 2. App. 36. That\nappeal is presently pending before this Court as SJC-06956.\n7. Pre-trial Proceedings\nOn April 20, 1995, the Commissioner moved to dismiss the third\namended contempt complaint on the ground (among many others) that the\nfacts alleged in BRI's 72-page complaint, even if entirely true, failed to state\na claim for contempt of the Settlement Agreement. App. 359. Rather than\nrule on this potentially dispositive motion as proposed by DMR's counsel,\nApp. 277, the court scheduled a trial on the contempt complaint, preceded by\na brief period of discovery. The court ultimately denied the motion to\ndismiss immediately prior to the commencement of the trial on June 26,\n1995, on the grounds that \"to insure judicial economy, a full evidentiary\nheating must be held on this Complaint for Contempt.\" App. 544.\nIn a pre-trial order, dated April 25, 1995, the court directed the parties to\npre-mark and bind a compilation of all \"uncontested\" exhibits. By including\nexhibits in the uncontested binder, the parties waived all evidentiary\nobjections except relevance. App. 415. Pursuant to this order, the parties\nultimately stipulated to 235 uncontested exhibits, U-1-- U-235, which were\nsubmitted to the court by BRI at the commencement of the trial on June 26,\n1995. Tr. 1:93.\nIn an order issued after the pre-trial conference, the court announced that\nthe trial would begin on June 26, 1995, and estimated that it would last\napproximately five weeks. App. 506. The court further directed the parties\nto file complete ,,fitness lists by June 12and advised them that any witnesses\nnot listed would not be permitted to testify? 7 ld BRI listed 45 potential\nwitnesses, App. 533-35; and DMR listed 128, App. 445-47, many of whom\nwere also included on BRI's list.\n27That order was later enforced against the Commissioner, Tr. X1:240-43, but not\nagainst BRI. Tr. V11:152-53.\n\n15\nOn June 5, 1995, the Commissioner filed an answer and counterclaim to\nthe third amended contempt complaint. App. 458-504. BRI failed to respond\nto the counterclaim until June 30, 1995, the fifth day of trial, App. 42,547-\n62, after the Commissioner had moved, unsuccessfully, for default judgment\non his counterclaim. App. 41.\n8. The Contempt Trial\nThe trial commenced on June 26 and concluded on July 14, 1995, thirteen\ntrial days later. Tr. I-XIII. During the trial BRI called seven witnesses, the\nparents called four witnesses, and the Commissioner called six witnesses. Id\nIn addition to the 235 uncontested exhibits, BRI introduced 90 exhibits, the\nparents and the Guardian ad Litem each introduced 1 exhibit, and DMR\nintroduced 80 exhibits.\nPrior to opening statements, counsel for the Commissioner objected to the\nparticipation of counsel for the class of students, parents, and guardians and\ncounsel for the student members of the class on the grounds that their clients\nwere not parties to the contempt proceedings? s Tr. 1:81-82. Without\nexpressly ruling on their party/non-party status, the court permitted them to\nparticipate as parties in the trial? 9 Tr. 1:84.

Counsel for\nthe studentmembers of_heclass didnot call any witnesses but examined several witnesses\ncalled bythe other parties and occasionally raised evidentiary objections toquestions asked\nand documents offered bythe Commissioner. For their relatively minimal participation in\nthiscase,the court awarded theseattorneys over $200,000 inat'tomeys' fees.

App. 32,\n39.\nOne such report was admitted into evidence in the contempt trial, over the\nCommissioner's objections. Tr. 11:98, 104-06. The requests of the Commissioner's counsel\nto obtain a copy of this report, both before and after its admission into evidence, Tr. 11:98,\n106. were initially denied by the court because \"there's only so much that the Court can do\nin the midst of this trial.\" Tr. 11:106.

II:19, 23; App. 545.\nSOOnApril 29, 1986, prior to the entry of the Settlement Agreement, the court appointed\nMs. Briggs as \"Guardian ad Litem to serve as an independent investigator for the Court?'\nApp. 3. Although the Settlement Agreement is silent as to any continuing role for a\nguardian ad iitem inthis case, Ms. Briggs signed the motion for apreliminary injunction and\nfiled an appellee's brief in the Mcgnight case, 406 Mass. at 788, and (along with Dr.\nDaignault, the court monitor) has submitted reports to the court from time to time. App. 32,\n39.\nOne such report was admitted into evidence in the contempt trial, over the\nCommissioner's objections. Tr. 11:98, 104-06. The requests of the Commissioner's counsel\ntoobtain a cop)' of this report, both before and after its admission into evidence, Tr. 11:98,\n106, were initially denied by the court because \"there's only so much that the Court can do\nin the midst of this trial.\" Tr. 11:106. After the lunch break, the Commissioner's counsel\nrenewed her request for a copy of the report, and the court again denied this request:\nMS. Yc_i_,_'_: Your }toner, with respect to the joint report [of}\nthe Court Monitor and the Guardian Ad Litem that's been introduced into\nevidence, may we have a copy at this point?\nTHE COURI: It is my practice to deny copies of GAL and\nMonitor reports and Iw'ill do so in this case. Thank you.\nMS. YOGMAN: ll's in evidence? Ican't have acopy of it?\nTIlE COURT: That's correct. You may not, nor may any other\npony to this proceeding.\nTr. 11:128. For this reason, no copy of that report is contained inthe record appendix.\nSlThe grounds for the Commissioner's objections were (I) that, as a mediator or\narbitrator, Dr. Daignault was disqualified from testifying as a v,'itness, and (2) that his\ntestimony as to the content of mediation discussions would have a chilling effect on the\nparties' willingness to be candid and to compromise in future mediations inthis case. App.\n545.\n\n17\n9. Contempt Findings and Conclusions\nAt the close of trial, the court directed all parties to file proposed findings\nand conclusions by July 24, 1995, n Tr. X111:133, which they did. App. 634-\n1130. On October 6, 1995, the court issued its Findings and Conclusions,\nApp. 1207-1321, which were taken, almost verbatim, from BRrs proposed\nfindings and conclusions. See Argument II1, infra, and Addendum to\nArgument I11,a separately bound volume filed herewith.\nThe court made 304 _3findings of fact? 4 App. 1207-93. On the basis of\nthose findings, the court concluded that the Commissioner \"is in contempt\nhaving clearly and undoubtedly disobeyed the Order of this Court. ''3_ App.\n1302. The court's findings and conclusions did not specify what conduct of\nthe Commissioner violated what provision(s) of the Settlement Agreement\nor other order(s) of the court. At the same time, the court issued an order\n\"denying\" the Commissioner's counterclaim. App. 1322.\n32Thisdirective was followed by atelephone callfrom the Assistant Register requesting\nthat the proposed fmdings and conclusions be submitted both in hard copy and on computer\ndisk.\n3JThecourt's last two findings are both numbered \"303.\"\n_41naddition to itscontempt findings, the court also made 25 \"Corollary Findings\" of\n\"Improper Conduct by DMR and Its Attorneys,\" App. 1287, which the court referred to the\nBoard of Bar Overseers. App. 1293. The Board of Bar Overseers has deferred its\nconsideration of this matter pending this appeal. As discussed in Arguments Iand III, infra,\nvirtually all of those findings are both immaterial and clearly erroneous.\n35Later, in its order denying the Commissioner's motion for a stay pending appeal (in\n_hich the Commissioner had pointed out this lack of specificity), the court belatedly made\nsome links between its findings and conclusions, by adopting, almost verbatim, large\nportions of BRI's memorandum in opposition to the stay. App. 1432, 1377.\n\n18\n10. Receivership and Injunctive Relief\nAs a remedy for this contempt, the court appointed a receiver s6 to\n\"exercise all powers presently held by DMR as well as any additional powers\nas may be necessary and appropriate. DMR's powers, as they relate to [BR1],\nits students and families, shall be totally superseded by the Receiver.\" App.\n1342. Among the powers expressly granted to the receiver are the following:\nto \"control all the funds and revenues of DMR as the), relate to JRC,\"\nApp. 1342;\nto \"review... all adverse regulatory decisions and actions taken by\nDMR against [BRI] and affirm, modify or rescind those regulatory\ndecisions and actions as required,\" App. 1343;\nto \"conduct a de novo review of any outstanding regulatory decisions\nincluding the Defendant's decisions regarding [BRI]'s Level 111\ncertification.., and make a decision on [BRI]'s application,\" App.\n1344;\nto \"develop and improve DMR's management systems, personnel\nstandards, [and] employee relations,\" App. 1344;\n- to \"direct, control, manage, administer and operate the properly,\nfunds and staffof DMR,\" App. 1345;\nto \"apply for and accept funds on behalfofDMR from any public or\nprivate entity or person for any lawful purposes,\" App. 1345;\nto \"contract on behalf of DMR with any public or private entity or\nperson for any lawful purpose,\" App. 1345;\nto \"approve and execute all contracts that DMR enters into,\" App.\n1345;\n3rThe Court appointed Judge James Nixon (Ret.) as the receiver. App. 49. The Court\nalso appointed Judge George N Assack (Ret.) as a special master. App. 1342. The five\ncourt-appointed quasi-judicial officers in this case--Dr. Daignault, the court monitor;\nBettina Briggs, the guardian ad litem; Judge Hurd, the court mediator; Judge Nixon, the\nreceiver; and Judge Assack, the master--are all permitted to have ex parte communication\nwith the parties and _'ith the court. App. 1350. This quasi-judicial superstructure\ncontributes to the unorthodox nature of the proceedings in this case.\n\n19\nto \"disaft]rm, reject or discontinue at any time any executor)' or\npartially-executed contract.., entered into before the date of this\nOrder, including but not limited to employment, consultant, personal\nor professional services and material contracts,\" App. 1346;\nto \"direct, supervise and oversee all employees of DMR, including\nwithout limitation, the Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, the\nlegal department, the investigations unit, area directors and service\ncoordinators,\" App. 1346;\nto '_create, abolish, and transfer positions, establish the duties of such\npositions, establish lines of authority and reporting, and otherwise\nreorganize the structure and responsibilities of DMR staff,\" App.\n1346;\nto \"hire, promote, transfer, discipline, suspend or discharge all\nemployees of DMR, and establish systems to evaluate periodically\nthe performance of each employee and to establish and enforce\nstandards of employee productivity,\" App. 1346;\nto \"file and prosecute suits or commence other legal actions in the\nname and on behalf of DMR,\" App. 1346;\nto \"defend, compromise and settle any legal action or administrative\nproceeding to which DMR is a party,\" App. 1346; mad\nto disaffu'm, reject, discontinue, amend, revise, or rescind any internal\nrule, regulation, policy, custom or practice of DMR,\" App. 1347.\nThe trial court's order further requires DMR to compensate not only the\nreceiver, at an hourly rate of $150, but also any lawyers, accountants, or other\nprofessional consultants that the receiver finds necessary for the performance\nof his duties. App. 1343, 1347-48. Furthermore, the court's order immunizes\nthe receiver in his capacity as receiver from any suit, legal action, or\nadministrative proceeding in any court or forum arising from any action taken\nby him in the performance of the above duties, unless the trial court expressly\nconsents to such suits. App. 1347, 1349. Under no circumstances can the\nreceiver be held personally liable for any action taken in the performance of\nhis duties. App. 1350. In addition to these receivership orders, the court also\nenjoined the Commissioner, \"his agents, attorneys, employees, and anyone\n\n20\nactingin concert with them,\" App. 1341; from \"tak[ing] an), action to\nobstruct, frustrate or interfere with the Receiver in the performance of his\nduties,\" App. 1348; from \"taking any retaliatory action against the Plaintiffs,\ntheir counsel, the Court Monitor or the Guardian ad litem\"; and from\n\"seek[ing] to accomplish through the Individual Guardianship proceedings\nwhat they are enjoined from doing herein.\" App. 1341-42.\n11. Attorneys' Fees\nAt the close of trial, the court directed all counsel to submit \"affidavit[s]\nof counsel fees and costs incurred in connection with the trial,\" Tr. XIII:43,\nwhich they did. App. 563-627, 1131-1200. When BRI's counsel submitted\nhis affidavit, the Commissioner objected on the ground that the affidavit did\nnot contain any contemporaneous time records. Tr. XIII:46. BRI's counsel\nthereupon submitted a memorandum, arguing that their time records are\nprotected by attorney-client privilege. Tr. XIII:46.47. The court declined to\nrule on the Commissioner's objection at that time. Id.\nIn the Commissioner's proposed findings and conclusions, he reiterated\nhis objection to BRI's fee affidavit) 7 App. 700, 737. Thereafter, the court\nissued an order instructing the parties \"to submit and file in camera their\nrespective existing unredacted legal bills that underly [sic] their Affidavits\nheretofore submitted on this issue.\" App. 1201. In that order, the court\nstated \"that such in camera review is necessary and appropriate in order to\ninspect and consider the confidential billing information under the\ncircumstances of this litigation where attorney-client privilege applies.\" ld\nIn his response to that order, the Commissioner objected to the court's in\ncamera consideration of opposing counsel's billing records without service\n37Theaffidavits of Kenneth Kumos and Eugene Curry(counsel for the class of students,\nparents, and guardians) and Michele Dorsey (counsel for the student members of the class)\nshare the same int'trmity. App. 1148, 1173, 1176.\n\n21\non the Commissioner, the party who would be charged with paying an)' fees\nawarded on the basis of those records? _\nOn the basis of counsel's fee affidavits and the court's in camera\ninspection of the underlying billing records, the court awarded a total of\nS1,098,087.50 in attorneys' fees and expenses to the 25 attorneys and\nparalegals who worked on this case on behalf of BRI, the parents, and the\nstudents, App. 1286. This total amount was bused on the full amount of time\npurportedly spent and the amount of expenses purportedly incurred by\ncounsel for the various parties, as stated in their respective affidavits. App.\n1321. Apart from the conclusory statements that the anlount awarded was\n\"fair,\" App. 1314, \"necessary and reasonable,\" App. 1286, and a list of the\nfactors considered by the court in reaching this conclusion, App. 1314-15, the\ncourt made no findings as 1o the reasonableness of the time spent by\nparticular attorneys on particular tasks or as to the reasonable necessity of the\n$71,017.34 in expenses incurred.\n12. Motions for Stay Pending Appeal\nThe Commissioner filed a notice of appeal from the contempt judgment, 39\nApp. 1353, and unsuccessfully sought a stay pending appeal of the court's\ninjunctive and receivership orders 4°from the trial court, App. 1355, 1430; a\nSingle Justice of the Appeals Court, App. 1357, 1454; a Single Justice of the\n3SBecause the Commissioner's response to the court's order calling for in camera\ninspection of billing records was impounded by the court, along with the billing records\nthemselves, App. 1206, no copies of these documents are included in the appendix. The\nCommissioner's subsequent motion to terminate or modify the court's sua sponte\nimpoundment order was denied.\n39After the appeal was docketed in the Appeals Court, this Court granted the\nCommissioner's application for direct appellate review.\n4°As recognized by the trial court, the court's award of attorneys' fees is automatically\nstayed pending appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P.62(a). App. 1432-33.\n\n22\nSupreme Judicial Court, App. 1456, 1465; and, finally, from this Court. 4_\nApp. 1469, 1471. Therefore, pending this appeal, the Commissioner's powers\nto regulate BRI remain entirely supplanted by those of the Receiver.\nStatement of Facts\nFor at least the last ten years, BILl has aggressively challenged various\naspects of state regulation of its program, as described in the Prior\nProceedings, supra. In the contempt complaint that gave rise to the present\nappeal, BRI focuses on the period from 1991 to the present and claims that\nDMR's regulation of BRI in three areas-certification to use aversive\nprocedures, licensing of its group homes, and setting of its tuition\nrates-violated various provisions of the ten-year-old Settlement Agreement\nin this case. Throughout this five-year period, despite almost constant\ncontroversy between the parties, DMR has continued to certify, license, and\nfund BRI. Accordingly, BRI's contempt claims are addressed primarily to the\nregulatory process, ratl,=r than to the substance of DMR's regulatory actions.\n41In its order denying the Commissioner's motion for a stay pending appeal and\ndismissing his appeal from the Single Justice's denial of such relief under G.L.c. 21I, §3,\nthis Court permitted the Commissioner to renew his request for astay in the present brief,\nv,hich he does in Argument IV.A.4, infra.\n\n23\nA. Certification Process\nThe facts underlying the present appeal primarily concern the process that\nresulted in the renewal of BRI's certification to utilize Level III aversive\nbehavior modification treatments, 4_\"subject to certain specified conditions,\nand the subsequent revocation of that certification because of BRI's refusal\nto comply with those conditions. That process is governed by DMR's\nbehavior modification regulations. 104 C.M.R. § 20.15.43\n!. Initial Recommendations of Field Review Team\nBRI submitted its application to renew its certification on July 31, 1991.\nEx. BRI-236. George Casey, a DMR attorney, and Dr. Kevin Reilly, a DMR\npsychologist, were assigned to review the application and make a\nrecommendation to the Commissioner. Ex. U-34. Accordingly, Attorney\nCase)' and Dr. Reilly visited BR1 in November 1991, Ex. BRI-36, where they\ninterviewed staff, reviewed records, and toured the day program. They did\nnot observe any aversive treatments, medical care, or stafftraining; nor did\n42Under DMR's behavior modification regulations, \"Level lit Interventions\" are defined\nas follows:\nI. Any intervention which involves the contingent application of physical contact\naversive stimuli such as spanking, slapping or hitting.\n2. Time out wherein an individual isplaced inaroom alone for aperiod of time\nexceeding 15minutes.\n3. Any Intervention not listed in 104 CMR 20.00 as a Level 1or level 11\nIntervention which is highly intrusive and/or highly restrictive of freedom of\nmovement.\n4. Any Intervention which alone, in combination with other Interventions, or as\naresult of multiple applications of the same Intervention poses a significant\nriskof physical or psychological harm to the individual.\n104 C.M.R. §20.15t,3)(d).\n43Effective December I, 1995, these regulations were re-promulgated and recodified\nas 115C.M.R.§ 5.14. To avoid confusion, this brief will cite only to 104 C.M.R. §20.15, the\ncodification that was cited below. Copies of these regulations are contained in the attached\nAddendum to this brief.\n\n24\nthe)' tour the group home component of BRl's program. Tr. I:104-07, 147-\n48, 182-83, 186; Ex. U-37. Based on their review of BRI's application and\non their visit to BRI, Attorney Case)' and Dr. Reilly recommended that BRI\nbe re-certified with five conditions, all relating to the composition and\noperation of BRI's Human Rights Committee. Ex. U-37. By letter dated\nJune 10, 1992, Amanda Chalmers, the Commissioner's designee, notified\nBRI that, prior to being re-cerlified, BRI would have to remedy the human\nrights deficiencies identified by Attorney Casey and Dr. Reilly. Ex. U-43.\nShortly thereafter, first by telephone and then by two follow-up letters,\nDMR inlbrmed BRI that it lacked sufficient information about the specialized\nfood program and the \"GED\" program to act on BRI's renewal application at\nthat time. 44 Ex. U-46, U-51; see also Ex. U-53 (explaining in more detail\nwhy DMR was seeking additional information on those two programs).\nDMR therefore requested additional information from BRI and indicated that\nit would add a nutritionist, a cardiologist, and an internist to the team\nreviewing BRI's application, who would make another visit to BRI to review\nthese two programs. Ex. U-46. In mid-September 1992, BRI provided some\ngeneral information in response to DMR's earlier requests. Ex. U-53.\nBecause that information was insufficiently specific, DMR requested more\ndetailed information by letter dated November 3, 1992, followed by a\nreminder dated December 21, 1992. Ex. U-57. BRI eventually responded to\nthese requests on January 6, 1993, by providing additional information about\nthe specialized food program. U-64. However, BILl declined to provide\ndetailed information about the GED device, unless DMR first entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement with respect to that information. Ex. U-66.\nAt about this same time, DMR became aware, through papers filed by\nBRI in the individual guardianship cases (in which DMR was not actively\nparticipating at the time) that BRI continued to experience some difficulties\n44As explained earlier, the specialized food program is a food deprivation program\nunder which a student may receive as litlle as 20 percent of his daily caloric requirement,\ndepending on his behavior during the day. Ex. U-166 at 12. The GED (graduated electronic\ndecelerator) is a device used to administer electric shocks to BRI clients as a means of\neliminating targeted behaviors. Ex. U-37 at 3.\n\n25\nxdth \"misfirings'\" of the GED. 4_Ex. U-58; Tr. 1:188-90. (The problems _ith\nmisfirings were twofold, Sometimes the GED did not emit a shock when\nactivitated, and sometimes it shocked a student without being activated.) Tr.\n1:188; Ex. U-74. Also during the same time period, the Commissioner\nreceived several letters from members of DMR's lfuman Rights Advisory\nCommittee expressing their concerns about the specialized food progranl.\nEx. U-42, U-59, U-60, U-62.\nAfter DMR signed the confidentiality agreement requested by BR1 and\nvarious scheduling problems were worked out, the review team re-visited\nBRI on May 5. 1993. Ex. U-66, U-68; Tr. 1:185-86. During that visit, the\nteam again spoke to various BRI staff members and reviewed additional\ndocuments but did not observe the use of any aversive procedures, including\nthe GED or the specialized food program. Tr. I:186-87. After this visit, in\nthe course of v_xiting its report, the review team requested further information\nfrom BRI concerning the specialized food program and the GED, Ex. U-70,\nU-74, which BRI then provided. Tr. 1:124; Ex. BR1-237.\nOn the basis of the information provided by BRI, the review team\nsubmitted a report on July 15, 1993, containing its findings and conclusions\nwith respect to the specialized food progranl and the GED-4 (a more\npowerful version of the GED) and again recommending that BRI be re-\ncertified to use Level I11 aversives, subject to two conditions requiring\nadditional reports on BRI's use of these two procedures. Ex. U-75.\nAlthough, on the basis of the information available to them, the review team\n\"could discern no adverse health consequences of the specialized food\nprogram,\" id at 6, it recommended that BRI be required to compile and\nprovide additional data in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nprogram and the degree of health risk involved for particular students, ld at\n6,11.\n4_During his visit to BRI inDecember 1991, Attorney Casey had been told by BRI staff\nthat previous problems with GED misfirings had been corrected, Tr. 1:189; but the papers\nfiled by BRI in the individual guardianship cases demonstrated that the problems were\ncontinuing. Ex. U-58.\n\n26\nSimilarly. with respect to the GED, while the physicians on the team\nopined, based on the information provided to them by BRI, that the GED-4\nprotocol \"does not present a danger to the students at BRI\" and that \"there are\nno medical contraindications to using this device for behavior modification,\"\nthe team noted that the problems with misfirings \"could affect the clinical\neffectiveness of the program.\" Id. at 6-7. The team was unable to comment\nfurther on the clinical effectiveness of the GED because the psychologist on\nthe team, Dr. Reilly, had resigned from DMR and left the state vfthout seeing\nthe information provided by BRI concerning misfirings, ld at 7 n. 18.\nBecause of the misfirings and because the GED-4 was a new device whose\n\"'safety parameters.., are still not clearly established\" and \"could present\nunknown problems,\" the team recommended that BRI be required to furnish\nadditional information on an)' changes in the design or use of this device and\nan analysis of the effectiveness of all GED devices then in use or proposed\nfor future use. ld. at 11.\n2. The Commissioner's Letter of August 6, 1993\nBased on his general counsel's analysis of the review team's report, Tr.\nV:53, and also on concerns raised both by DMR's Human Rights Advisor)'\nCommittee, Ex. U-42, U-59, U-60, U-62, and by Dr. Paul Jansen (a\npsychologist who had evaluated some BRI students in connection with their\nindividual substituted judgment proceedings), Ex. U-81, the Commissioner\ndecided to gather further information prior to taking final action on BRI's\napplication for re-certification, rather than immediately re-certify BRI as\nrecommended by the review team. Tr. V:53. Accordingly, on August 6,\n1993, the Commissioner sent a letter to Dr. Israel, BRI's Executive Director,\noutlining his concerns, requesting further information, and granting BRI\ninterim certification for 25 days, pending receipt of the infornmtion\nrequested. Ex. I_'-82. BRI responded to this letter on August 28, 1993, by\ncriticizing the certification process, contesting the factual statements and\nlegal conclusions set forth in the Commissioner's August 6th letter and in the\n\n27\nletterfromDr.Jansena,ndprovidinginformationanddocumentisnresponse\ntotheCommissioner'rsequests.Ex.DMR-17.\nIn order to assisthim in gatheringand assessingthe additional\ninlbrmation neededto nmkea final decisionon BRI's applicationfor\nrccertificationt,heCommissionearssembledlargeandsmall\"BRI working\ngroups,\"_vhichmetonTuesdaymorningsinhisoffice. Ex.BRI-257,BRI-\n258.Although the primary purpose of these groups was to consider BRI's re-\ncertification application, the groups also discussed other BRl-related subjects.\nincluding, e.g., rate-setting, public relations, investigations, and legal issues.\nTr. V:104-06, as indicated by the workplans (which served as agendas for\nthose meetings) and by the notes of the participants. Ex. U-190--U-225,\nBRI-293--BR1-305, BRI-320_BRI-322. 46\n3. Interim Certification Letters, 1993\nThe information provided by BRI in response to the Commissioner's\nAugust 6th letter did not entirely alleviate the Commissioner's concerns and\nraised some additional questions, particularly about BRI's use of mechanical\nrestraints. Ex. DMR- 17 at 20-21. Nevertheless, the Commissioner extended\nBRI's interim certification for an additional 25 days, by letter dated August\n31, 1993, with certain conditions, in order to give BRI an opporttmity to\nprovide further information. Ex. U-91. In that letter, the Commissioner\nexplained the factual and legal basis for each of the stated conditions. 1d at\n7-8.\nAmong those conditions were requirements that BRI notify DMR if it\nproposed to use other aversive procedures in addition to those currently in\nuse, id at 3, and that BILl comply with DMR's regulations concerning the use\nof mechanical restraints, ld Another condition required BRI to cooperate\nwith an independent performance and program review of BRl to be arranged\nby DMR. ld at 7. That review was ultimately performed by the Rivendell\nGroup, which issued a comprehensive report on BRI's program, Ex. DMR-2.\n46See Argument III.B.13, infra.\n\n28\nCondition 10 of the August 31 letter required BRI to inform out-of-state\nagencies that fund students at BRI of the requirement that those agencies\nhave in place \"an emergency plan for each resident to address the funding and\nlogistics of any unexpected medical, personal or progran_matic situations\nwhich BR1 deems are beyond the capacity of BRl to address.\" Ex. U-91 at\n5. As explained in the letter, that condition was intended to address\nsituations, which had occurred in the past, in which BRI determined that it\nwas no longer able to meet the needs of an out-of-state client, and the state\nthat had placed the student at BRI had no contingency plans in place, leaving\nDMR forced to serve the client in the interim, ld at 8; Tr. V:78-79; Ex.\nDMR-18. After BRI objected to this condition, the Commissioner agreed to\namend it in the manner proposed by BRI. Ex. U-99, U-106. Although BRI\nfeared that this condition would discourage funding agencies from placing\nstudents at BRI, when notified of this condition, representatives of agencies\nfunding four BILl clients stated \"that their state had emergency services for\nall of their clients and that an emergency plan should not be an issue.\" Ex.\nDMR-34 at 3.\nCondition 11 of the same letter required BRI to give DMR and any other\nfunding agency at least 60 days' notice before withdrawing any or all\nessential services from any client. Ex. U-91 at 5. As explained in the letter,\nthat condition, like Condition 10, was intended to address emergencies\ncreated by BRI. ld.; Tr. XI11:75. In imposing this requirement, the\nCommissioner sought to avoid what he had been told had occurred in\nresponse to OFC's orders in 1985, i.e., that while OFC had ordered only that\ncertain specified treatments be stopped, BRI had stopped all treatments,\nthereby creating a crisis. Tr. XII1:65.\nIn order to enable out-of-state agencies to better understand the status of\nBRI's application for re-certification, the Commissioner sent them copies of\nhis August 6 and 31 letters, along with a copy of BRI's 52-page response to\nthe August 6 letter. Ex. U-105. In his cover letter, dated September 24,\n1993, the Commissioner reassured these agencies that the conditions\ncontained in his letters \"are not intended to imply that the Department intends\nto take any action that would negatively affect the treatment of an)'\n\n29\nconsumer.\" M On the preceding day, Dr. Israel, BRI's Executive Director,\nhad also sent letters to these same agencies reassuring them that BILl's\n\"program has never been stronger.\" Ex. DMR-33. The Commissioner also\ncorresponded and met with the parents of BRI students to keep them\ninformed and allay their anxieties. Ex. U-92, U-109; Tr. V:82-91.\nBy letters dated September 24, 1993, and December 15, 1993, DMR\nagain extended BRI's interim certification to utilize Level Ill aversive\nbehavior modification procedures, with substantially the same conditions,\nwhile the DMR working groups gathered and evaluated additional\ninformation from various sources. Ex. U-106, U-128, U-190--U-225.\n4. Certification Letter of February 9, 1994\nBy letter dated February 9, 1994, the Commissioner continued BRI's\ncertification for another six months and indicated that, if BRI complied with\nthe stated conditions by May 8, 1994, the certification would be effective for\ntwo years from that date. Ex. U-139. Among the conditions contained in that\nletter was a requirement that BRI develop a written treatment plan for each\nclient that fully complies with DMR regulations, since the sample plan\npreviously provided by BRI did not. Id at 3. Two other conditions, to which\nBRI particularly objected, required independent psychiatric and medical\nevaluations of BRI's clients, in order to determine if the clients' behavior\nproblems might be due to the existence ofunmet medical or psychiatric needs\nthat could be addressed with less restrictive treatments, ld at 8-1 I.\nAlthough, as stated at the close of that letter, BRI had a right to seek\nadministrative and judicial review of the Commissioner's decision, id. at 18.\nBRI did not do so.\nAs the May 8 deadline for compliance with the conditions for further\ncertification approached, it became apparent that BRI would fail to achieve\ncompliance by that date. However, rather than decertify BRI, DMR instead\noffered to suspend the May 8 deadline and enter into a period of intensive\ndiscussions with BRI in order to attempt to reach agreement as to how and\nwhen BRI would comply with each of the conditions for certification. Ex. U-\n\n30\n150.BRIagreedtoparticipateinsuchdiscussionsi,d, which commenced\non May 9, 1994, and continued almost daily until the end of June 1994. ld\nThrough these intensive discussions, BRI and DMR reached agreement\nas to precisely how and by what dates BRI would comply with each of the\nconditions contained in the Commissioner's February 9, 1994, letter. Ex. U-\n150. Accordingly, by letter dated July 5, 1994, the Commissioner further\nextended BRI's certification to December 31, 1994, and stated that, if BRI in\nfhct implemented its agreements to comply vAth each of the conditions and\nwith the underlying DMR regulations, a two-year certification to use the\naversive procedures would be issued, ld.\n5. Certification Letter of January 20, 1995\nFrom July 1994 through December 1994, DMR closely monitored BRI's\ncompliance with the requirements of DMR's behavior modification\nregulations and the conditions contained in the Commissioner's February 9,\nand July 5, 1994, certification letlers. Tr, VI:46-47, Ex. U-166, DMR-23. As\npart of that monitoring process, five DMR psychologists, Ex. DMR-\n10---DMR-14, evaluated the implementation of the treatment plans of six\nindividuals, pursuant to the parties' agreement on Condition 1of the February\n9 letter, Ex. U-152, and prepared detailed reports on each student's treatment.\nEx. DMR-3--DMR-8. Based on these reports and on other information\ngathered during the certification process, DMR staff prepared a\ncomprehensive Report on Compliance by [BR1] with the Requirements of the\nBehavior Modification Regulations and the Terms of Certification to Use\nLevel lllAversives. Ex. DMR-23.\nBased on all of the above information, the Commissioner determined that\nBRI had not fully complied with the certification conditions or with the\napplicable DMR regulations. Nevertheless, by letter dated January 20, 1995,\nthe Commissioner certified BRI to utilize Level III aversives through May 8,\n1996, subject to five remaining conditions. Ex. U-166.\nAmong the conditions imposed by the Commissioner on January 20,\n1995, and the one most vigorously opposed by BR1, was the requirement that\n\n31\nBRIceaseutilizingcertainspecifiedLevel111intereentionsi,ncludingthe\nspecializedfoodprogram.Ex.U-166at12.Thisconditionwasbasedon\nDMR'sdeterminatiotnhatthereisnoprofessionalilteraturetosupporttheuse\nof theseproceduresastreatmentforhumanbeingsin generalor for the\nproblemse.'xhibitebdyBRIclientsinparticulara,ndthatthespecializedfood\nprogramdeprivesaclientofbasicsustenanceld,\n6. Certification Revocation\nAs stated at the close ofthe Januai), 20th letter, BRI had a right to seek\nadministrative and then, if necessary, judicial review of the certification\nconditions, pursuant to 104 C.M.R. § 20.15 (4)(t\")(8); G. L. c. 19B, § 15(d);\nand G. L. c. 30A, § 13. Id at 13. Howevei, rather than utilize these available\nremedies, Tr. VIIl:I05, BR1 unilaterally refused to comply with the\nconditions. Ex. U-168, U-171, U-172. On that basis and on the basis of\nDMR's own monitoring, which confirmed that BRI was not complying with\ncertain conditions, the Commissioner notified BRI, by letter dated March 23,\n1995, that its certification would be revoked effective July 1, 1995. Ex. U-\n179. Immediately thereatter, again without seeking judicial or administrative\nreview, BRI filed the third amended contempt complaint that gave rise to this\nappeal, ld\nB. Licensing Process\nBecause BILl's program has a residental component, it is also subject to\nthe DMR regulations governing licensing of group homesY In the fall of\n1994, DMR conducted a survey of BRI's group homes to determine whether\nits licenses to operate those homes should be renewed. Tr. X:33-35. As a\nresult of that survey, called \"QUEST\" (Quality Enhancement Survey Tool),\n47Licensing of group homes is a separate process, governed by different regulations,\nthan certification to use aversive behavior modification procedures, 115CM.R, §§8.00\net seq.\n\n32\nthe surveyors concluded that BRI had \"not achieved\" or had only \"partially\nachieved\" ntany of the licensing criteria, including those relating to the\nphysical safety and hLunan rights of BRl's clients. Ex. U-164. In April 1995,\nDMR indicated that it would give BRt at least 90 days to rectify the\ndeficiencies identified in that survey. Ex. U-183. As of the time of trial, in\nearly July, 1995 DMR had taken no action to revoke or suspend BRI's group\nhome licenses. Ex. U-188; Tr. X:35. As explained in a letter from DMR's\nDirector of Survey and Certification, if this survey process eventually results\nin BRrs group home licenses being revoked or suspended, BRI will have an\nopportunity to appeal any such action pursuant to 115 C.M.R. §§ 8.21(4),\n8.33(1)(b), and 8.34, and to seek judicial review of any adverse\nadministrative decision pursuant to G.L.c. 30A, § 14. Ex. U-183.\nC. Rate-Setting Process\nIn recent years, BRI's tuition rates for Massachusetts clients have been set\nby the Divisiott of Purchased Services (\"DPS\"), pursuant to that agency's\nauthority to set rates for private schools serving school-aged children with\nspecial educational needs. Ex. BRI-292; Tr. V:112, V111:165-67. Based on\na provider's average per-student costs, DPS sets a fiat per-student rate (about\n$161,000 for BRI in 1994-95, Tr. VII1:167), regardless of the level of\nservices provided to each individual client. Ex. BRI-292; Tr. V:112. This is\nnot the method generally used by DMR and other state agencies to establish\nthe amotmts paid to providers of services to adult clients. 4s Rather, these\namounts are usually set by negotiated contracts specific to each client for\nwhom services are provided. Tr. 11I:270, V:113-17.\n4SForthis reason, in January 1994, in the context of the rate-setting proceedings on BRI's\nFY 1995 tuition rate, DMR questioned whether DPS should continue toset BRI's rate, inthat\nBRI was then serving no Massachusetts students under the age of 22. Ex. BRI-262 at 4; Tr.\n111:266-70.\n\n33\nAs of the time of trial, at the turn of the 1995-96 fiscal )'ear, DMR and\nBRI had not entered into either an agreement to use the DPS rates or any\nother contractual arrangement for fiscal year 1996. ** Therefore, it was\nunclear, at the time of trial, what the legal mechanism for payment to BRI\nwould be for the coming year. Nevertheless, the Commissioner stipulated\nthat DMR intended to pay HRI for any services rendered to DMR clients\nduring fiscal )'ear 1996. Tr, XIII:132.\nBy letter dated June 30, 1995, the last day of the fiscal year, DMR\n\"prequalified\" BRI to enter into a contract with DMR for fiscal year 1996, on\nthe condition that BRI cooperate with DPS's then-pending request for\ninformation concerning BRI's legal expenses. Ex. BRI-267. DPS had sought\nthat information in order to determine whether BRI's rate for prior fiscal years\nshould be reduced, retroactively, to account for nonreimbursable expenditures\nfor lobbying and for legal fees incurred in suing the Commonwealth. s° l'x.\nBRI-267. s_ As stated in that decision, if, based on the requested information,\nDPS determined that a downward adjustment of BRrs rates was warranted,\nBRI would have an opportunity to appeal any such determination, ld\n'_'_DMRattempted to initiate contract negotiations in September, October, and December\nof 1994, but BRI did not come to the negotiating table until mid-June 1995. Tr. X1:264-67;\nEx. DMR.60, U-161.\n5°In an audit conducted in 1993, the State Auditor also questioned the reimbursability\nof BRI's legal expenses but was unable to reach any definitive conclusions on this issue,\nbecause BRI refused to provide sufficient documentation of its legal and lobbying expenses\nto the Auditor. Ex. BR1-267.\nStUpon receipt of DPS's request for information, BRI subpoenaed Michael Kan, the\nAssistant Commissioner of DPS, to testify inthe contempt trial. Tr. VI: 161-68. However,\nBRI ultimately decided not to call him, because they could produce no evidence linking his\nrequest for information to any allegedly contumacious conduct by DMR, Tr. IX:56-57,\nv,'hich the court had required as a precondition for admitting evidence on this subject. \"l-r.\nV1:168-69.\n\n34\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThis is a contempt case. Even if the trial court's findings of fact were\ngrounded in the evidence, they would not support a judgment of contempt,\nbecause they do not show any \"clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear\nand unequivocal commaJld.\" The Settlement Agreement does not bar DMR\nfrom regulating BRI, or from denying, conditioning, or revoking its\ncertification or licenses. On the contrary, the Settlement Agreement\nexpressly requires BRI to comply with all applicable state regulations and\nauthorizes DMtl, DMR's predecessor, to revoke BRI's licenses without court\napproval. Thus, DMR's decisions regarding BRI's certification and licenses\ncannot be the basis for a judgment of contempt. Afortiori, the\nCommissioner's subjective motivations for making those decisions, which are\nthe principal subject of the trial court's factual findings, cannot constitute\ncontempt. (pp. 37-43)\nThe requirement in Part A of the Settlement Agreement that BRI obtain\nauthorization for the use of aversive procedures through individual\nsubstituted judgment proceedings does not bar DMR from regulating BRI's\nuse of such procedures. That requirement imposes obligations on BRI, not\non DMR. Moreover, the authorization provided by substituted judgment\ndoes not require BRI to use all procedures authorized but only supplies the\nsubstituted consent of the ward to receive them. Thus, regulatory constraints\nimposed by DMR on BRI's use of such procedures do not conflict with an)'\norders issued by the Probate Court in the individual cases. (pp. 43-46)\nPart B, ¶ 2, of the Settlement Agreement, which describes the\nresponsibilities of the court monitor, does not by its terms impose any\nobligations on DMR, still less any \"clear and unequivocal command.\" If the\ndirection that the court monitor \"oversee\" BRI's compliance with \"all\napplicable state regulations,\" except those governing behavior modification\nprocedures, and \"arbitrate any disputes between the parties\" imposes any\nobligation at all on DMR, that obligation is too ambiguous to be enforceable\nby contempt. Moreover, nothing in the Agreement even mentions mediation.\nThus, the trial court's findings that DMR refused three requests to mediate\n\n35\novertheten-yearhistoryof theAgreementdonot supportitscontempt\njt,dgmen:.(pp.46-51)\nPartC,_,3,of:heSettlemenAtgreement, providing that \"intake at B.R.I.\nlbr new clients shall be reopened and shall not be impermissibly obstructed,\"\nalso by its terms imposes no obligation on DMR. The context of the case\nshows that this provision related specifically to rescission of OFC's 1985\norder and OFC's activity pending DMtt's assumption of licensing\nresponsibility. Even if this provision has any implication for I)MR, it\nexpresses no constraint whatever on action relating to BRI's current students.\nEven as to new students, it is far from \"clear and unequivocal,\" since it does\nnot indicate what obstruction would be \"impermissible.\" The trial court\nmade no finding that DMR ever closed or obstructed intake. Its findings that\nDMR's communications with referring agencies in other states adversely\naffected BRI's reputation are too attentuated to support a judgment of\ncontempt of this provision. (pp.51-53).\nThe final sentence of the Agreement, providing that \"each party shall\ndischarge its obligations under the terms of this agreement, in good faith,\"\ndoes not in and of itself provide the clear and unequivocal command\nnecessar7 to support a contempt judgment. By its terms, this provision is\nlimited to the performance of obligations stated elsewhere in the agreement;\nit imposes no general duty of good faith. Moreover, the phrase \"good faith\"\nis inherently subjective and ambiguous. The trial court's findings of \"bad\nfaith\" action by DMR involve conduct entirely independent of an)'\nsubstantive obligations under the Agreement; indeed, these findings for the\nmost part relate not to any actions at all, but to discussions, motivations,\nplans, and desires. Suchfindingscannotsupportacontemptjudgment. (pp.\n53-61)\nEven if findings of the sort entered here could support a contempt\njudgment, and even if the evidence supported the findings, the trial court\nrecord is so replete with evidentiary errors that a new trial would be required.\nAmong the most egregious of those errors is the admission of evidence as to\nBRI's financial condition, despite BRI's having failed to produce a witness\nknowledgeable on that subject in response to a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. A\n\n36\nsimilarlyprejudicialerroris thecourt'srefilsaltopermitI)MR'sexpertto\ncx,'tmincthestudentswho,accordingtowitnessescalledbytheparentsh, ad\nbeenharmedbycessationofthespecializedfoodprogramafterthecloseof\ndiscovery.Thecourt'srulingthattheevidencetobeobtainedthroughsuch\nexaminationwouldbeirrelevandt irectlycontradictsitsrulingadmittingthe\nparentse'videnceonthesamepoint.

Such scrutiny reveals that each and every one of the trial\ncourt's findings, and most particularly those involving bad faith, perjury.\nmisrepresentations, and misconduct of various kinds, lacks any support in the\nrecord. Where the findings bear any connection to the trial transcript at all,\nthe)' reflect not actual testimony, but mischaracterizations of testimony\ncontained in questions posed by BRI's counsel. In numerous instat_ces, the\nonly pertinent evidence in the record directly contradicts the court's findings.\n(pp. 70-149)\nEven if a judgment of contempt were warranted on the record, the\nextraordinary relief entered far exceeds the bounds of the trial court's\ndiscretion. Rather than exercise the caution required in imposing equitable\nremedies, particularly against an agency of a co-ordinate branch of state\ngovernment, the trial court completely deprived DMR of its statutorily\ngranted role. Further, the court conferred on the receiver powers and\ninunanities far beyond any even possessed by DMR. In doing so, the court\nnot only abused its discretion but intruded unconstitutionally into the\nauthority ofthe legislative and executive branches. The harm resulting from\nthis intrusion affects not only DMR but a host of other state agencies and\nofficials, as well as third parties, including DMR employees, vendors, unions,\nand clients. Most important, the harm affects BRI students, by depriving\nthem of the protection of effective oversight of the application to them of the\nmost intrusive treatments permitted by law.

The trial court's\nreceipt of those records in camera and its sun sponte impoundment of them\nwere erroneous, since no privilege applies to billing records used to support\na fee claim. Moreover, even the limited docunlentation that was provided to\nthe Commissioner shows that the aJnoant awarded included some items that\nare patently unreasonable, such as time spent on lobbying, preparing public\nrecords requests, and responding to abuse investigations. In addition, the\nnearly $200,000 awarded to attorneys for the parents and students, whose\ncontribution to the proceedings was minimal, was unwarranted. (pp. 164.\n167)\nARGUMENT\nI. TIlE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATrER OF LAW IN\nHOLDING THE COMMISSIONER IN CONTEMPT OF TIlE\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.\nIn order to hold a part), in contempt, the court must find \"a clear and\nundoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.\" E.g., Warren\nGardens Housing Co-op. v. Clark, 420 Mass. 699, 700 (1995). Under that\nstandard, this Court has upheld contempt findings of clear and specific\norders, where such orders were undoubtedly violated. E.g., Commonwealth\nv. One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, 413 Mass. 407,409, 411 (1992) (despite\n\n38\ncourtorder to \"return [a] van.\" was not returned)/2 tlowever, where the\norder is ambiguous or the disobedience is indirect or doubtful, this Court has\nnot hesitated to reverse contempt findings on appeal. See. e.g., Warren\nGardens, supra (reversing finding of contempt of an order requiring tenants\nto \"adequately supervise\" their children, which the Court characterized as\ninsufficiently \"clear,\" to form the basis for a contempt sanction); U.S. Time\nCorp, v. G.E.M. of Boston, hlc., 345 Mass. 279, 282-83 (1963) (reversing\nfinding of contempt of an order requiring defendant to refrain from selling\nwatches below list prices at premises under his \"control,\" where such control\nwas proved only indirectly, under a theory of implied agency). 53\nIn the present case, nowhere in the court's voluminous findings of fact or\nconclusions of law is there any finding or conclusion as to what conduct by\nthe Commissioner constituted \"clear and undoubted disobedience\" of what\n\"clear and unequivocal\" provision(s) of the settlement agreement. Rather, the\ncourt's entire application of the law of contempt to the facts of this case\nappear_ in the following two conclusory sentences:\nThe provisions of the court-ordered Settlement Agreement\nare clear and unequivocal commands which are binding on\nthe defendant.\nThe defendant is in contempt having clearly and\nundoubtedly disobeyed the Order of this Court.\n52See also Allen v. School Committee of Boston, 400 Mass. 193, 194 (1987) (order\nrequired school committee to provide \"reliable, timely, and substantially uninterrupted\ntransportation,\" and no transportation was provided to thousands of students for up to 12\ndays): Town of Manchester v.DEQE, 381 Mass. 208, 212 (1980) (order required town to\nhire an engineer and submit final operating plans for dump by specific dates, and to,an failed\nto take these actions until more than ayear later); United Factory Outlet, Inc. v.dag\"s Stores,\nInc., 361 Mass. 35, 36 (1972) (order prohibited stores from using the words \"Mammoth\nMart,\" and stores used those words in newspaper advertisements).\n53See also Hinds v. Hinds, 4 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 66-67 (1976) (reversing finding of\ncontempt for failure to convey house where order did not specify date for conveyance);\nBurke v. Guiney, 700 F.2d 767, 770 (lst Cir. 1983) (reversing finding of contempt of gag\norder where statement made topress, \"while perhaps implying more,\" did not \"directly\" state\nwhat the order prohibited).\n\n39\nApp. 1302. Rather than identify which office 304 findings of fact constitute\nclear and undoubted violations of which purportedly clear and unequivocal\ncommands, the court simply states: \"The numerous muhiple violations of\nDMR are set forth in the Findings of Fact and need not be repeated here.\" ld\nttowever, reference to the Findings of Fact is equally unavailing, because\nthose findings contain no indication as to the relevance of any finding to an)'\nprovision of the Settlement AgreementP\nIn any event, even if every one of the court's 304 findings were factually\ncorrect (which _ill be strenuously contested, infra) the court erred as a matter\nof law in concluding that these facts constitute a direct violation of any clear\nand unequivocal provision of the Settlement Agreement. As will be shown\nin the following _,ubsections, neither the Settlement Agreement as a whole\nnor an)' of the four provisions relied upon by BRI in its third amended\ncontempt complaint is sufficiently unambiguous to form the basis tbr a\ncontempt citation. Nor are the court's findings (even if they were factually\ncorrect) sufficient as a matter of law to establish that the Commissioner\nclearly and directly violated any of the provisions in question.\nA. The Settlement Agreement Does Not Prohibit\nDMR from Regulating BRI.\nThe Settlement Agreement in this case contains no \"unequivocal\ncommand\" that the Com,-:fissioner refrain from regulating BRI in general\"\nS'_l\"hetrial court's belated attempt to b')lster its contempt findings and conclusions in its\norder denying the Commissioner's motion: for a stay pending appeal, App. 1432, adds\nnothing of substance to the court's original cot tempt findings.\nSSlndeed, itis doubtful that any state agency would have the authority to enter into an\nagreement abdicating the regulatory duties conferred upon itby the Legislature through the\npolitical process. Boston v.Back Bay Culturaltlssoc., 418 Mass. 175, 184(t994) (\"officers\nof governmental agencies have authority to bind their governmental bodies only to the extent\nconferred by the conl_rolling statute\"); Evans v. City of Chicago, I0 F.3d 474, 478 (7th Cir.\n1993) (\"[T]emporary officeholders may not contract away the basic powers of government\n•.. in the same way natural persons may make enduring promises about their own future\n(continued...)\n\n40\nor from conditioning or revoking BRI's certification to utilize l.evel Ill\naversives or licenses to operate group homes in particular, Nor does the\nAgreement require I)MR to certify or license BRI by any particular dates or\nfor ant' particular duration. To the contrary, while no mention is made in the\nAgreement of \"certification,\" the Agreement expressly authorizes DMII\n(I)MR's predecessor agency) to revoke BRI's licenses without court approval,\nonce BRI became licensed by DMtt. App. 127.\nFar from insulating BRI from state regulation, the Settlement Agreement\nexpressly requires BRI to comply with all applicable state regula'.ions,\nincluding those of DMII. App. 126, 128-29. Moreover, the Settlement\nAgreement expressly excludes from the general monitor's responsibilities the\nduty to monitor BRrs compliance with regulations governing the use of\nbehavior modification procedures: \"Dr. Daignault shall be responsible for\noverseeing B.R.I.'s compliance with all applicable state regulations, except\nto the extent that those regulations involve treatment procedures authorized\nby the Court in accordance with Paragraph A.\" App. 126.\nThe \"treatment procedures\" referred to in this exception to the general\nmonitor's oversight responsibility are the \"aversive procedures\" defined in\nPan A of the Agreement to include \"all aversive procedures which are\npresently used or may be proposed for use at B.R.I. with [specified]\nexception[s].\" App. 121. At the time the Settlement Agreement was entered\ninto, \"state regulations\" \"applicable\" to these \"treatment procedures\" had not\nyet been finalized. Ex. U-9, DMR-27 at 27. Such regulations, 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15, were eventually promulgated and are now administered by DMR.\nSubsection 20.15 (4)(e) of those regulations, requires all providers (including\nBRI and DMR itself) who propose to use Level III aversives on incompetent\nindividuals to obtain authorization of the Probate Court in substituted\njudgment proceedings prior to doing so. However, DMR's behavior\nss(...continued)\nbehavior.\"), cert denied, 114 S. Ct. 1831 (1994). Certainly, no such unenforceable\nrequirement should be read into the Agreement. Berger v. Siegel, 329 Mass. 74, 77-78\n(1952) (avoiding construction rende_'ing contract unenforceable).\n\n41\nmodification regulations contain nlany additional requirementsS6--including\ntile requirements pertaining to certification--that also \"involve [I,evel Ill\navcrsivc] treatment procedures\" and are therefore excepted from the general\nnlonitor's oversight authority under Part B, ¶ 2. Those regulations are\nadministered exclusively by DMR itself, not by the monitor or by the Probate\nCourt. Indeed, the very fact that the Agreement refers to \"regulations\ninvolving treatment procedures authorized by the ('ot_rt \"demonstrates that\nwhere such procedures (i,e., Level 111aversives) were concerned, the parties\ndid not contemplate exclusive court control. Rather the)' contemplated a role\nfor the Probate Court (i.e., substituted judgment proceedings), a role for tile\ncourt monitor (i.e., temporarily monitoring BRI's compliance with\nregulations, other than behavior modification regulations), and a role for\nDMII/I)MR. (i,e,, administering its own behavior modification regulations\nonce promulgated).\nFrom the outset, it was understood by all parties to the Settlenlent\nAgreement that BRI would be subject to the behavior modification\nregulations once promulgated, including the certification requirements\ncontained in those regulations, and that those regulations would be\nadministered and enforced by DMH itself, not by the court monitor or the\nProbate Court, In a letter to the parents of BRl students shortly after entry of\nthe Settlement Agreement, Dr. Israel, BRI's Executive Director, advised the\nparents that \"[a]n independent court monitor will regulate BRI (taking the\nplace of OFC) between now and July 1, 1987, when the Department of\nMental ttealth takes over the licensing of BRI.'\" Ex. DMR-26 at 2. In order\nto make BRI's \"position concerning monitoring quite clear,\" he stated:\nWe recognize the need for programs such as ours to be\nsubject to thorough regulatory scrutiny, and we look foward\n5_'Forexample, these regulations require providers who use Level lit aversi','es to have\nhuman rights committees and peer review committees, 104C,M.R. §20.15 (4Xd)(3) and (5);\nto obtain qualified medical review to determine that the treatment plan is not\ncontraindicated, 104C,MR, §20.15 (4)(d)(4); to submit to a program inspection by DMR\nrepresentatives and to provide inspection staff with access to the program and its records.\n104 C.M.R.§ 20.14 (4)(0(6).\n\n42\n[sic] to the new relationship with the Commonwealth that will\nbe created as we come u,_der the licensing authority of the\nMassachusetts Department of Mental llealth. We are\nheartened that this Department will be the new monitoring\nagency for BRI.\nhi. at 6.\nSimilarly, six months after entry of the Settlement Agreement, Dr. Israel\ntestified that he had been invited to comment on DMIt's then-proposed\nbehavior modification regulations, and that he felt that the current draft was\n\"one that we believe we can live with.\" DMR-27 at 27. At the same hearing,\ncounsel for DMH similarly testified that these regulations would be\napplicable to BRI just as to all other providers using behavior modification\ntreatments; that DMII and DMR (not yet a separate entity) would be\noverseeing compliance with those regulations by all providers, including\nBRI; and that he thought BRI would \"have no trouble whatsoever in meeting\nits responsibilities under the regulation and under the Settlement Agreement\n[which he viewed as \"consistent\" with each other], once that regulation is\npromulgated.\" ld at 134-36. Dr. Daignault, the court monitor, consistently\ndescribed his monitoring role as limited to \"overseeing compliance of B.R.I.\nwith State licensing regulations during the transition period from the Office\nfor Children licensure to the Department of Mental Health licensure?' ld at\n163. In their trial testimony, both Dr. Israel and Dr. Daignault reaffirmed\ntheir understanding that BRI is subject to DMR's behavior modification\nregulations, including particularly the certification requirements. Tr. VIli:9-\n24. IX:4-9.\nBecause virtually all of the court's factual findings relate to DMR's\ncertification or licensing processes, App. 1207-93, which are governed by\nDMR regulations, and not by the Settlement Agreement, all of those findings\nare immaterial to the only issue properly before the court in this contempt\nproceeding, i.e., whether the Commissioner directly violated any unequivocal\nprovision of the Settlement Agreement. Moreover, even if the\nCommissioner's licensing or c _rtification decisions were somehow relevant\nto some obligation of his under the Settlement Agreement, the trial court,\n\n43\nproperly,madenofindingsanddrewnoconclusionassto the merits of those\ndecisions/7 Rather, the court's findings focus not on the merits of the\nCommissioner's regulator)' actions but on the subjective motivations\nunderlying them. As will be discussed in Argument I.E.I, it_a, if the\nsubstance of the Commissioner's certification and licensing decisions cannot\ntbrm the basis for contempt sanctions, then, afortiori, his subjective\nmotivations for making such decisions certainly cannot be punishable as\ncontempt.\nB, The Commissioner's Regulator,:' Actions Do Not\nConstitute Contempt of Part A of the Setllemen!\nAgreement or of the Probate Court's Rulings in\nIndividual Substituted Judgment Proceedings.\nTo the extent that the court's contempt judgment is premised on an\n(unstated) conclusion that the Commissioner's regulator)' actions constitute\ncontempt of Part A of the Settlement Agreement or of the Probate Court's\norders in substituted judgment proceedings involving individual students at\nBRI, _8any such conclusion is incorrect as a matter of law. Part A of the\nSettlement Agreement imposes no obligations on DMR, except to provide\nclinicians to assist the court in reviewing treatment plans, App. 125, Ex. U-\n13; and there are no allegations or findings that DMR failed to comply with\nthat requirement. Nor do the Probate Court's orders in the substituted\njudgment proceedings, conducted pursuant to Part A, even run against DMR.\nSee, e.g., Ex.

While a particular Level\nII1 aversive cannot be used without Probate Court approval, the converse is\nnot true.

The Commissioner's Actions, As Found by the\nCourt, Do Not Constitute Contempt of the\nArbitration Provision of the Settlement\nAgreement.\nPart B, ¶ 2, of the Settlement Agreement, authorizes Dr. Daignault to\n\"undertake general monitoring of B.R.I.'s treatment and educational\nprogram\" (emphasis added). App. 126. As general monitor, Dr. Daignault\nis \"responsible for overseeing B.R.I.'s compliance with all applicable state\nregulations\" exceg: DMR's behavior modification regulations, as discussed\nabove. (Emplmsis added.) ld. Under the same paragraph, he is further\nrequired to report to the court any health or safety issues he deems necessary\nand to \"arbitrate any disputes between the parties. \"_ ld \"[l]n the event that\n62As Dr.Israel himself acknowledged, BRI need not (and does not) seek Probate Court\napproval before discontinuing the use of procedures contained in apreviously approved\ntreatment plan.

App. 194,\n213.\n\n47\nan;,, part)' disagrees with any decision or recommendation of Dr. Daignault,\"\nPart B, ¶ 2, further provides that \"the matter shall be submitted to the Court\nfor resolution.\"\nRather than impose any clear and unequivocal obligation on anyone,\nmuch less the Commissioner in particular, this paragraph is inherently\nambiguous in five significant respects. First, it is unclear what are the\n\"applicable state regulations\" Dr. Daignault is charged with overseeing.\nEven Dr. Daignauit himself was unable to give a direct answer to this\nquestion when asked:\nQ. [W]hat agency regulation[s] do you oversee BRI's\ncompliance [with] other than with the Department of\nMental Retardation regulations?\nA. Any that would apply.\nQ. And what are those?\nA. Any that would apply that would be brought to my\nattention, [in] my capacity of overseeing the\ncompliance with them.\nTr. IX:16.\nSecond, as to the meaning of \"overseeing,\" Dr. Daignault resorted to\n\"Webster's Dictionary,\" which, he said, defines this word to mean\n\"supervising or watching out for.''6_ Tr. IX:I7. Although the title of Part B,\nApp. 125 (\"Monitoring of Substituted Judgment Treatment Plans and B.R.1. 's\nTreatment Program,\" emphasis added), and the language of paragraph 2 in\nparticular, App. 126 (\"monitoring of B.R.I.'s... program's; \"overseeing\nB.R.I.'s compliance\"), would seem to require Dr. Daignault to oversee BR/,\nhe testified that this provision requires him to \"oversee[] the work of what\nothers [without specifying who] are doing to enforce regulations. ''_ Tr.\n651nfact, Webster's New World Dictionary (3rd college ed. 1991) defines \"oversee\" in\narange of more and less intnasive senses, including: \"to watch over and manage; supervise;\nsuperintend;.., to survey; watch; [or] to examine; inspect.\"\n_Afier the court reassigned Dr. Daignanlt's arbitration functions to Judge Hurd, Dr.\nDaignault sought \"confirmation\" from the court of his remaining duties as court monitor.\nApp. 269. The court's tautological ruling on this motion provided no further guidance to\nhim or the parties beyond the language of the Agreement itself, since the court simply found\n(continued...)\n\n48\nIX:lT. If Dr. Daignault's interpretation of his role is correct, it is certainly not\n\"unequivocally\" so.\nThird, the arbitration provision of Part B, ¶ 2, falls particularly short of\nimposing any unequivocal obligations on the Commissioner. While Dr.\nDaignault is required to \"arbitrate\" disputes and, apparently, to make\n\"arbitration decision[s] or recommendations,\" App. 126, nothing in the\nAgreement requires him to undertake the quite different role of \"mediating\"\ndisputes or requires others to utilize him in the latter role? 7 Thus, although\nDMR and other parties voluntarily submitted disputes to Dr. Daignault or\nJudge Hard for mediation on numerous occasions, see, e.g., Ex. U-98, U- 113,\nU-182, DMR-79, the Settlement Agreement cannot be read as giving clear\nand unequivocal notice to DMR that failure to seek or agree to mediation\nwould be punishable as contempt. All of the court's findings concerning\nBRI's requests for mediation and DMR's responses thereto, e.g., App. 1229-\n31, 1236, 1241, 1270-71, 1275-76, are therefore entirely immaterial.\nFourth, it is also unclear whose disputes this provision requires Dr.\nDaignault to arbitrate. As discussed above, at the time the Settlement\nAgreement was entered into, both BRI and Dr. Dalgnault himself anticipated\nthat Dr. Daignault's role as general monitor would end once DMH took over\nthe regulation of BRl from OFC. Thus, Dr. Daignanlt's obligation to arbitrate\n\"disputes between the parties\" was apparently designed to cover any\ncontinuing disputes between BRI and OFC in the interim period, rather than\n_(...continued)\n\"that Dr. Daignault's responsibilities are confirmed as set forth in the Settlement\nAgreement.\" App. 420.\n67Thewords \"mediate,\" \"mediator,\" or\"mediation\" appearnowhere inthe Agreement.\nAs recognized byDr. Daignaul_himself, thewords\"arbitration\" and \"mediation\" have very\ndifferent meanings. Tr. IX: 20 (\"mediation involves the parties an'iving atthe decisions\nthemselves without being dictated toas isthe case inarbitration\"). Compare Joseph R.\nNolan &Jacqueline M.Nolan-Haley, Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990)at 105(defining\n\"Arbitralion\" as a\"process of dispute resolution inwhich aneutral third party (arbitrator)\nrenders adecision\") and iv/.at 981 (def'ming\"Mediation\" as a\"[plrivate, informal dispute\nresolution process inwhich aneutralthird person, the mediator, helpsdisputing partiesto\nreach an agreement. Themediator has nopower toimpose a decision onthe parties.\").\n\n49\nan)' subsequent disputes between BRI and its new licensor, DMH. Although\nseveral years later,after DMR took over licensing authority from DMH, the\ncourt made DMR a \"party\" to this case, itis far from clear that doing so was\nintended to expand the substantive scope of this provision, particularly since\nthe court's order making DMR a party was rendered by way of\"allowing\"\nDMR's more limited request to substitute itself for DMH, wherever DMH\nwas mentioned in the Agreement. Ex. U-10, U-13. See Prior Proceedings,\nsubsection 2, supra.\nFifth, since the early days of ,,he Settlement Agreemet_t, it has been\nparticularly unclear what subject matter(s) are arbitrable under this provision.\nAt a hearing six months after entry of the Agreement, counsel for two of the\nindividual wards alerted the court that then: might \"need to be, in short order,\nsome clarification as to what types of disputes are appropriate for submission\nto the Monitor and which are not.\" Ex. DMR-27 at 122. No such\nclarification was forthcoming, and the scope of the arbitration clause has\ncontinued tobe unclear. See, e.g., Ex. BRI-246, BRI-276, U-96, U-110, U-90\n(\"the historical understanding of the Settlement Agreement--including in\n[the Attorney General's] office--is not what [Attorney MacLeish's] letter sets\nforth\").\nThis lack of clarity stems, in part, from an internal inconsistency in thc\nprovision itself. While the overall scope of the general monitor's authority\nis defined to exclude oversight of BRI's compliance with behavior\nmodification regulations, thedispute-resolution component of this oversight\nfunction is described tocover \"any\" dispute between the parties. App. 126.\nWhile Dr. Daignault focuses on the word \"any,\" as broadly defining the\nscope of his authority to resolve disputes, 68Tr. IX:21; and BRI has also\n6Sinpractice, Dr.Daignaultsometimes took anarrower viewofthe scope of hisdispute-\nresolution authority. Forexample,whenDMR askedhimtoapproveitsuse ofthe Rivendell\nTeam to perform an independentreview of BRI'sprograJn as part of the certification\nprocess, Dr. Daignaultdeclinedon the groundthat todo sowasoutside thescope of his\nauthority under Part B, ¶ 2. Ex. U-103, U-104. Dr. Daignaulfs anempt, on cross-\nexamination,toharmonizethisearlier,more limitedview of hisauthority withthe broader\nviewhe now espouses was, atbest, unconvincing. Tr.IX:21-24.\n\n50\nbroadly construed that provision, at least in recent years, 69Ex. BRI-245, Ex.\nBRI-246; DMR's understanding is that disputes over behavior modification\ntreatments fall within the express exception to Dr. Daignault's general\nmonitoring authority. Ex. U-90, U-182; App. 379-80, 413.\nFor these reasons, it is far from \"unequivocal\" that the arbitration\nprovision applies to the few specific instances where the court found that\nDMR refused to mediate. F. 116, App. 1237; F. 129, App. 1241; F. 282,\nApp. 245. In each of these instances, the subject that BRI sought to mediate\nconcerned BRI's certification to use aversive behavior modification\nprocedures 7°and therefore, at least arguably, tell within the express exception\nto the monitor's authority under Part B, ¶ 2.\nMoreover, even if the arbitration provision meant what BRI construes it\nto mean, and were sufficiently unambiguous to support a contempt citation,\nthe court's factual findings are insufficient as a matter of law to establish\ncontempt. The court cited only three instances in the ten-year tenure of the\nSettlement Agreement in which DMR refused to mediate. F. 116, App. 1237;\nF. 129, App. 1241; F. 282, App. 245. On many other occasions, while DMR\nreserved the right to argue that arbitration or mediation was not legally\nrequired, it nevertheless agreed to mediate such disputes and frequently\nengaged in such mediation at BRI's request. E.g., F. 114-15, App. 1236-37;\nEx. U-98, U-113, U-i 14, U-182, DMRo79. Therefore, even if this provision\nof the Settlement Agreement \"clearly and unequivocally\" required DMR to\narbitrate disputes involving behavior modification procedures, the court's\nfindings indicate that the Commissioner's conduct fell far short of\n69Asdiscussed in the PriorProceedings, supra, in 1989and 1990. BKI filed three\ncomplaintsagainst DMRandotherstateagencies inthe Bristol ProbateCourtwithout first\nseeking arbitrationwiththe courtmonitor.\nr_.. 116,App. 1237(sending copies of certification letters toout-of-state agencies); F.\n129, App. 1241(requiting BRI to appoint Commissioner's designee toits HumanRights\nComminee as a condition of interim certification to use Level II1ave_sives); and F.245,\nApp. 244 (requitingBR| tosubmit to areview of _'ea_aent planimplementation pursuant\ntoacelXificationcondition).

Accordingly, to the extent that the court's contempt\nfinding was premised on a violation of this provision, it was incorrect as a\nmatter of law.\nD. The Commissioner's Actions, as Found by the\nCourt, Do Not Constitute Contempt of the\nProvision of the Settlement Agreement Prohibiting\nBRI's Intake t_f New Clients from Being\n\"Impermissibly Obstructed.\"\nPart C, ¶ 3, of the Settlement Agreement provides, in pertinent part, that\n\"intake at B.R.I. for new clients shall be reopened and shall not be\nimpermissibly obstructed during the pendency of this agreement.\" App. 127.\nIt is not clear on the face of this provision, which is in the passive voice, who\nhad the obligation to open intake of new st_ldents and not to \"impermissibly\"\nobstruct it during the pendency of the Se_lement Agreement, which ,,vas\nanticipated to terminate automatically one year after its execution. App. 132.\nHov,'ever, since it was OFC that closed intake in the first place, Tr. VI!!:73-\n74, App. 52, it is reasonable to assume that this provision was intended to\nimpose a requirement on OFC, rather than any other party. In any event, this\nprovision does not clearly and unequivocally impose any such obligation on\nDMR, or even DMH, DMR's predecessor as licensor of BRI.\nFurthermore, on its face, this provision does not unequivocally prohibit\nall interference with the intake of new clients but rather provides only that\nsuch intake shall not be \"impermissibly obstructed.\" Since this provision\nthus provides no clear and unequivocal notice of what conduct might be\ndeemed to be an \"impermissible obstruction\" of intake, this provision is not\n\n52\nenforceable by contempt. 7j Cf. Warren Gardens, 420 Mass. at 701 (phrase\n\"adequately supervise\" not enforceable by contempt for this reason).\nNor does this provision provide clear and unequivocal notice to the\nCommissioner that his conduct with respect to existing students at BRI could\nlx punishable as contempt of this provision, which expressly relates only to\n\"intake at B.R.I. for new clients\" (emphasis added). To the extent that the\ncourt's contempt finding holds the Commissioner responsible for any indirect\neffect of his conduct on other funding agencies' decisions not to refer new\nstudents to BRI, any such indirect effect would not be punishable as\ncontempt, which requires a direct violation of a court order. 7: Burke v.\nGuiney, 700 F.2d at 770.\nNowhere does the court find that the Commissioner ever entered any\norder closing or in any way limiting or obstlucting BRI's right to take in new\nstudents. In fact, as admitted by BRI's Executive Director, no one at DMR\never issued such an order. Tr. Viii:74.\nEven if this provision could be deemed to provide clear and unequivocal\nnotice to the Commissioner that he could be held in contempt for conduct\nadversely affecting referrals of new students to BPA by other agencies, the\ncourt's findings are insufficient to support a conclusion tha' the\nCommissioner directly and undoubtedly violated this provision. The only\nfindings even remotely relating to intake of new students are those describing\nthe Commissioner's communications with state and local agencies in other\n7_lf\"impcrmissible\" inthis context means inviolation of some generally applicable law\nor regulation, thenany such obstructions would be tedressable pursuant to the administrative\nand judicial remedies available for violations of the wovision(s) inquestion, rather than by\ncontempt. Such aconstruction would be generally consistent with the provision in the same\npart of the Agreement that, once DMIt took over the licensing function, it could revoke\nBRI's license without prior court approval. App. 127.\n_2Another provisionoftheSettlement Agreement,PartF,App. 130,relatesmoredirectly\ntoreferrals byparentsandstateagencies toBRI. However, this provision wasnotcited by\nBR] orbythetrialcourtasabasis for holdingtheCommissioner in contemptinthepresent\ncase. Cf Prior Proceedings, subsection3, infra.\n\n53\nstates, which, according to the court, adversely affected BRI's reputation? 3\nF. 118, App. 1238. Although the court infers a causal connection between\nthis damage to BRI's reputation and its declining enrollment, F. 290, App.\n1282, it makes no findings to support an inference that the Commissioner's\nconduct directly caused other agencies not to refer new students. TMThus, to\nthe extent that the court's contempt holding was based on a conclusion that\nthe Commissioner undoubtedly violated an unequivocal provision concerning\nintake of new students, that holding is incorrect as a matter of law.\nE. The Commissioner's Actions, as Found by the\nCourt, Do Not Constitute Contempt of the\nGood Faith Provision of the Settlement\nAgreement.\nIi The Good Faith Provision Is Too Ambiguous to\nForm the Basis for Contempt Findings or\nSanctions.\nThe concluding sentence of the Settlement Agreement, Part L, provides\nthat \"each party shall discharge its obligations under the terms of this\nagreement, in good faith.\" App. 133. By its own terms, this good faith\n73As shown in Argument lll.B.8.a and 15, infra, those findings are also clearly\nelToneous.\n74\"1\"othe €onWaty, the uncontradicted evidence at trial showed that out-of-state agencies\ningeneral and New York State inparticular have policies and/or legislation favoring in-state\nover out-of-state placements, which policies have motivated their efforts to find alternative\nin-state placements for BRI clients and to place newly eligible clients in state rather than\nrefer them to BRI. Tr. IV:66, VIII:90, 94-95, IX:I I1-12; Ex. DMR-80. Despite these\npolicies, BRI continues to take in new students, including four between January and June\nof 1995, two of whom came from New York State. Tr. Vi11:85-86. In fact, BRI's student\nenrollment inthe summer of 1994 was at least 57 (the number of students who underwent\nmedical evaluations at that time), Ex. BRI-285, precisely the same number of students\nenrolled atBRI in July 1991, when BRI first submitted its application for re-certification.\nEx.BRI-236 at 1.\n\n54\nprovisionapplies only to the parties' \"obligations under the [Settlement\nA]greement.\" ld Therefore, to hold the Commissioner in contempt of this\nprovision, the trial court would have to identify an \"obligation under the\nterms of this agreement.\" that the Commissioner has failed to discharge in\ngood faith. As discussed above, the Agreement imposes no obligation on the\nCommissioner to refrain from regulating BRI and the Commissioner's\nconduct did not, as a matter of law, constitute contempt of any of the other\nprovisions cited by BRI as a basis for their contempt complaint. Therefore,\nany implicit finding of contempt based on a violation of the good faith\nprovision alone should be reversed as a matter of law. See UniledStates v.\nBoard of Education of Ckicago, 744 F.2d 1300, 1307 (7th Cir. 1984) (where\nparty found not in violation of substantive requirement of consent decree,\npart)' could not be found in contempt of requirement to use good faith efforts\nto comply with that provision), cerl. denied, 471 U.S. 1116 (1985); Boardof\nEducation of Chicago, 799 F.2d 281,292 (Tth Cir. 1986) (good faith \"not a\nterm that exists in a vacuum\"; nature and circumstances of underlying\nobligation must be considered in determining good faith compliance).\"\n751he other cases cited by BRI in its proposed conclusions of law, App. 1013, and\nadopted bythe cou_ App. t304, arenot to the €on_a_y. In Murphy v. Timberlane, $55 F.\nSupp. 498 (D.N.H 1994), the defendant school district was not held in contempt forits \"bad\nfaith\" standing alone, nor was a bad faixh requirement \"implied\" by the court as the trial\ncourt states in itsConclusions of Law. App. 1304. Rather, the defendant school district in\nthat case was sanctioned foritsnoncompliance with aprior court order, which required the\nparties to establish a compensatory education plan forthe plaintiff in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in the applicable statute and warned that delays inthis process resulting\nfrom bad faithwould b¢addressed by the coup's exercise of itsequitable powers. Id at 501.\nItwas only after finding that the defendant had intentionally delayed the process, inviolation\nof the court's prior order, that the court held the defendant in contempt, ld at517-18.\nIn citing the district court's unpublished opinion in Bates v. Johnson, App. 1304-05 the\ntrialcourt neglects to cite the decision on appeal inthat case, holding thatthe district court's\noral orderwas unenforceable and therefore dismissing defendant's appeal from the substance\nof order. 901 F.2d 1424, 1426 (7th Cir. 1990). On another point, rather than support the\ntrialcourt's broad interpt_,_tion of the Settlement Agreement, the court of appeals decision\nin that case takes a much more limited view of the effect of consent decrees on the\nregulatory powers of state officials. /d at 1426 (\"A state's right tomake freshchoices about\ndomestic policy aspolitical officials may even bean implied term inaconsent decree, given\n(continued...)\n\n55\nAs recognized by this Court, in the absence of any substantive\nreqt_:ement that public officials act in good faith, the \"'acts of admiuistrative\nofficers cannot be attacked injudicial proceedings on the ground that in fact\nthose officers were not governed by the highest standards of impartial and\nunselfish performance of public duty.'\" Brennan v.

United States v. Board of Education, 717F.2d\nat385. Indeed, imposing such sanctions on the Commissioner for the making\nof policy decisions in the exercise of his statutory authority raises serious\nseparation of powers problems, sj /at at 383; 799 F.2d at 289. Accordingly,\neven if the Commissioner's interpretation of his authority is held to be\nerroneous, rather than impose contempt sanctions, the court should have\nassumed that, as a public official, he would henceforth act in accordance with\n79Eveninthe commercial context, where presumptions of good faithand separation of\npowers concerns are absent, \"[w]ant of good faith involves more than bad judgment,\nnegligence orinsufficient zeal.

By, instead, holding the Commissioner in\ncontempt for what the court found tobe improperly motivated regulatot_,, actions, the court\nsharply diverged from the ordinary relationship between the judicial, the legislative, and\nexecutive branches, in which executive decisions are reviewed by thejudiciary based solely\non legal standards set by the Legislature, not on the subjective motivations of the\ndecisionmaker. Brennan v. The Governor, 405 Mass. at 397-98; Wilson v. Brookline\nHousing Authority, 383 Mass. at 879. Such a gross departure from the ordinary separation\nof powers should be supported by a far clearer statement than an agreement to carry out\ncertain obligations in \"good faith.\"\n8_deed, to the extent that the Agreement can beconstrued toprevent the Commissioner\nfrom exercising his statutory anthodty, it is doubtful that the officials who entered into this\nAgreement had the authority to bind him tothat extent. See Bates v.Johnson, 901 F.2d at\n1426 (state official cannot, by consent decree, preclude successors from making \"fresh\"\npolicy choices); Evans v.City ofChicago, l0 F.3d at 480 (same).

SheriffofWorcester Count),, 382 Mass. 57, 63 (1980) (ordinarily\ncourt wiU not issue injunctive order against public official when declaratory\njudgment of official's legal duties will be sufficient to accomplish\ncompliance).\n2. The Court Impermissibly Shifted the Burden\nof Proof onto the Commissioner to Prove His\nGood Faith.\nIn a contempt case, \"the burden [is] upon the petitioner to prove [the\nrespondent's clear and undoubted disobedience of an unequivocal court\norder], not upon the respondent to disprove it.\" US Time, 345 Mass. at 279.\nBecause of the presumption that public officials act in good faith, LaPointe\nv. License Board of Worcester, 389 Mass. 454, 459 (1983). BRI had a\nparticularly heavy burden in proving contempt of the good faith provision of\nthe Settlement Agreement. And that burden could not be met merely by\npersuading the court to disbelieve the Commissioner and other DMR\nwimesses, seeAtkinson v. Rosenthal, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 223-24 (1992)\n(disbelieving evidence presented by one party does not satisfy the opposing\nparty's burden of establishing the contrary proposition), or to reject their\nexplanations for the challenged conduct, cf. St. Mary's Honor Center v.\nHicks, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2750-54 (1993) (in employment discrimination ease,\ncourt's disbelief of employer's asserted reasons for challenged action, not\nsufficient to satisfy employee's burden of establishing discriminatory\nmotive). Rather, it was incumbent on BRI to prove, by its own affirmative\nevidence, that the Commissioner acted in bad faith.\nContrary to these well-sealed principles, the cotm's comments during the\ntrial and its findings thereafter demonstrate that it impermissibly imposed the\nburden on the Commissioner to prove that he acted in good faith. On the\nvery first day of trial, in the midst of the direct testimony of BRI's first\nwitness, the court interrupted BRI's counsel's direct examination to instruct\n\n59\nthe Commissioner's counsel that the court expected the Commissioner to\nexplain the good faith basis for the conduct being testified to by BRI's\nwitness. Tr. !:180-81. Similarly, throughout its findings, the court repeatedly\ndraws inferences of bad faith solely from findings that the Commissioner was\nunable to prove the good faith basis for his facially permissible actions to the\ncourt's satisfaction, s:\nWhile it may be difficult, if not impossible, for a contempt petitioner to\nsatisfy its burden of proving something as subjective as good faith, see\nHartforddccident & Indemnity Co., 11 Mass. App. Ct. at 1000 (plaintiffs\nexpressions of belief, not based on personal knowledge, insufficient to show\ndefendant's lack of good faith), that does not justify shifting the burden to the\nrespondent. Rather, this further highlights why a party's lack of\"good faith\"\ncannot be the basis for holding him in contempt.\nS2See,e.g, F.68,App. 1226(\"CommissionerCampbell wasunabletoshowthat\"hehad\nasked BRIforcertaininformation);F.92, App. 1231(\"Commissioner Campbellattempted\ntojustify\"theamount of lagalresourcesdevotedtocertificationprocess);F. 118,App. 1238\n(\"Commissioner Campbell could notoffer anexplanationas to why\" he keptout-of-state\nagencies informed of certificationprocess);F. 140,App. 1242-43 (\"norcould [the Assistant\nCommissioner] provideanexplanation\" for IO-daydeadline forbidstoperform program\nreviewofBRI);F. 184,App. 1253(\"Inabilityof the Commissionertooffer anyjustification\n[forconductingtitlesearches of BRI'sproperties]demonstrateshisbad faith.\");F.230, App.\n1268(\"Commissioner Campbellcould notidentify anycredible reasonforthe imposition\nofa conditionregardingmedical evaluations.\"). Even iftheCommissioner had the burden\nof explaining his otherwise unobjectionable actions, each of the above findings, as tohis\nfailuretoprovidesuchexplanations, isclearlyerroneous, assho_al inArgum-.ntIll.B, infra.\n\n60\ns The Court's Findings of Subjective \"Bad\nFaith,\" Even If True, Are Insufficient, As a\nMatter of l.aw, to Constitute a \"Direct\" and\n\"Undoubted\" Violation of the Good Faith\nProvision of the Settlement AgreemenL\nEven if the good faith provision could be broadly construed to require the\nCommissioner to act in good faith in some general sense, to conclude that the\nCommissioner \"directly\" and \"undoubtedly\" violated this provision would\nrequire findings that the Commissioner acted in bad faith, not simply that his\nsubjective motivations were improper. See United States v. Board of\nEducation, 744 F.2d at 1307; 799 F.2d at 292. Here, virtually all of the\ncourt's findings of bad faith relate only to the Commissioner's \"plans,\"\n\"desires,\" and \"intentions,\" rather to any concrete actions on his part. s3\nMost of the actions that are cited as evidence of this improper intent are\nnot, and could not reasonably be, characterized as improper in themselves, s4\nAnd, even as to those actions that are themselves characterized as improper,\nthere are no findings that those actions, in fact, caused the \"desired\" effects;\nindeed, the court's findings are either directly to the contrary or noticeably\n83Eg, F. 52, App. 1222 (\"bad faithpurposeof.., discussions\"); F. 62, App. 1224\n(\"Campbell's concern as to how his agency might be depicted in the upcoming CBS\ntelevision program\"); F. 112, App. 1236 (\"plan toplace JRC inreceivership or to close JRC\ndown\"); F. 166, App. 1248 (\"DMR'splan to get abiased review of JRC... in time for the\nDecember 15deadline, which is the date DMRplannedto de-certify JRC\"); F. 167, App.\n1248 (\"desire not to certify JRC... consistent with DMR's overall plan to put JRC out of\nbusiness\"); F. 186, App. 1254 (\"plan to disrupt financial operations of JRC\"); F. 188, App.\n1255 (DMR \"targeting €losure BRI\" by discussing potential receivership action); F. 230,\nApp. 1268 (\"condition regarding medical evaluations.., designedto disrupt the operation\nof JRC\"). (Emphases added.) In addition, as shown inArgument Ill.B, infra, each of these\nfindings is clearly erroneous.\nShE.g., F. 62, 63, 195-96; App. 1251-54, 1259, 1262 (taking various actions in\nanticipation of anationwide television documentary concerning DMR and BRI); F. 176-85,\n203,207; App. 1251-54, 1259-62 (discussing matters other than certification at DMR staff\nmet'linKs concerning BRI); F. 187, 207; App. 1254, 1261-2 (establishing contacts with other\nstates' mental retardation agencies).\n\n61\nsilent in that regard, s_ The connections that the court does draw between the\nCommissioner's conduct and BRI's purportedly adverse circumstances are fat\ntoo attenuated to be characterized as \"direct\" for purposes of drawing a legal\nconclusion of contempt. _ US. Time Corp., 345 Mass. at 282-83; Burke v.\nGuineA', 700 F.2d at 770.\nWhen all was said and done, despite whatever the Commissioner and his\nstaff may have discussed, planned, or desired, they did not close do_a BRI,\nput it into receivership, or put it out of business. To the contrary, from\nAugust 1993 to July 1994 the Commissioner repeatedly extended BRI's\ninterim certification to use Level Ill aversives and, on January 20, 1995,\nultimately granted final certification effective until May 9, 1996. Ex. U-82,\nU-91, U-106, U-128, U-139, U-152, U-166. And, despite BRI's fears of\nimpending doom, it not only remains in business but enjoys a surplus of\n$520,000. F. 302, App. 1285.\nIn sum, the court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the\nCommissioner's motivations and actions were direct and undoubted\nviolations of any clear and unequivocal provisions of the Settlement\nAgreement. Absent these necessary prerequisites for contempt sanctions, the\ncontempt judgment should be reversed, as a matter of law, without reaching\nany of the other independently sufficient grounds for reversal that are\ndiscussed in the remainder of this brief.\naSE.g, F. 112, App. 1236 (no finding that DMR took any action to place BRI into\nreceivership); F. 166, App. 1248 (no finding that report prepared by Rivendell was, in fact,\nbiased, orwas used tojustify any adverse action by DMR); F. 184, App. 1253 (no finding\nthat title search of BRI's properties revealed any related party transactions or was othen_ise\nused against BRI) F. 197-201, App. [258-59 (DMR's \"attempt... to interfere\" with BRI*s\ntuition rate proved unsuccessful); F.302, App. 1285 (despite actions \"intended\" to put BRI\nout of business, BKI still has a surplusof over $500,000).\n_E.g., F.285, 288, 291; App. 1280-82 (DMR's regulatory activity resulted in increased\nlegal costs for BRI, which resulted in layoffs of BRI staff, which resulted in higher\nstudent/staffratios, which resulted in decrease in quantity and quality of services provided\nto students).\n\n62\nII. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL, THE TRIAl,\nCOURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN RULING ON\nEVIDENTIARY [SSUES_ TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF\nTHE COMMISSIONER.\nThe trial record is replete with evidentiary errors, only the most egregious\nand prejudicial of which are raised here. Taken together they demonstrate a\nconsistent pattern of abuse of discretion, legal error, and lack of even-\nhandedness that so taints the proceedings as to warrant reversal of the court's\ncontempt judgment in tote or, at the very least, a new trial.\nA. The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in Allowing\nBRI to Present Evidence as to BRI's Financial\nCondition, after BRI Failed to Produce Anyone\nwith Knowledge of This Subject in Response to the\nCommissioner's Rule 30(b)(6) Deposition Notice.\nDuring the discovery period, DMR notified counsel of record of its intent\nto take the deposition of BR1, pursuant to Mass. R. Cir. P. 30(b)(6), by the\nperson with the most knowledge of the factual basis of the allegations\ncontained in the third amended contempt complaint. App. 510. In response\nto this notice, BRI produced Dr. Matthew Israel, its Executive Director, as its\nsole witness. App. 512, 521-22.\nIn the course of that deposition, on May 3 and 10, 1995, counsel for the\nCommissioner questioned Dr. Israel as to the factual basis for various\nallegations contained in the third amended contempt complaint (which he\nalone had verified under oath), including allegations concerning BPd's\nfinancial condition, t7 In response to questions about BRI's financial status,\nstaffing, and student census, Dr. Israel repeatedly claimed a lack of\nsTE.g., App. 520 (asking for factual basis of allegation contained in Third Amended\nComplaint, _ 62, that Commissioner's conduct is\"threatening [BRI]'s viability as agoing\nconcern, '_App. 31I, and receiving the answer, \"I'm not sure of the economic status at this\nmoment.\").\n\n63\nknowledge. App. 514-30. After exhausting Dr. Israel's knowledge or\nmemor)' as to the factual basis for the the allegations in the complaint, the\nCommissioner's counsel stated that, if there were more time, she would seek\nan order requiting BRI to produce additional witnesses, g8The deposition was\nthen suspended, but not completed. App. 531-32.\nAt the pre-trial conference on May 18, 1995, BRI filed a pre-trial\nmemorandum listing three BKI employees as witnesses who are \"expected\nto testify as to the financial impact the actions of DMR have had on [BRI],\nincluding as well, intake and consensus [sic] information which show the loss\nof clientele and referrals which [BRI] has suffered,\" App. 436, the vet)' areas\nas to which Dr. Israel claimed lack of knowledge or memory at the Rule\n30(b)(6) deposition of BRI. After reading BRI's pre-trial memorandum\n(which had been served in hand that day), counsel for DMR orally requested\nthat the May 18, 1995, discover), deadline be extended to permit the\nDepartment to complete its Rule 30Co)(6) deposition by deposing additional\nwitnesses, including those listed by BRI as potential trial witnesses, with\nknowledge of these subjects. App. 540. That request was denied by the court\nfrom the bench. 19 ld.\nAt trial, when BRI called its accountant, Arthur Mullen, to \"testify with\nrespect to [BRI] financial condition and the effect in terms of prior to DMR's\nactions and the current financial situation,\" Tr. V!II:159-60, the\nCommissioner's counsel reiterated her pre-trial objection to his testimony,\nbased on BRI's failure to produce a knowledgeable witness on this subject in\nresponse to the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice of BRI. Tr. V111:160-61.\nSSThe discovery deadline was May 18, 1995, App. 417, and other depositions had\nalready been scheduled for all available dates in the interim.\nSglnatelephone conversation following the conference, the Commissioner's counsel was\nadvised by the Assistant Register that counsers request for additional discovery and the\ncourt's denial thereof would not appear on the court's docket unless this request were made\nbyv,xitten motion. Tr. VIII: 161. Accordingly, a written motion was filed on June 13, 1995,\nApp. 40, 508, but was not acted upon by the court until the first day of trial, on June 26,\n1995, at which time it was denied on the ground that the motion was untimely. App. 540.\n\n64\nThatobjection was overruled, Tr. V11:162; and Mr. Mullen was permitted to\ntestify at length on this subject. Tr. V111:163-96.\nPermitting Mr. Mullen to testify as to BRI's financial status was\nextremely prejudicial to the Commissioner, since the extraordinary relief\nultimately granted by the court was premised almost exclusively on the\nfinancial harm to BRI that the court found was caused by DMR's regulator),\nactions. App. 1283-86, 1312-13. The court'sfindings of such financial harm\nwere based expressly, App. 1285, and (presumably) solely on Mr. MuUen's\ntestimony, since he was the only _itness who testified on this subject.\nAbsent any opportunity to depose BRI on the subjects of Mr. Mnllen's\ntestimony, the Commissioner's cross-examination of this vdmess was\nnecessarily abbreviated and limited to questions concerning the witness's\nexperience and the bases for his direct testimony. Tr. VIII:185-94.\nBy allowing this testimony over the Commissioner's objections, the court\nabused its discretion under the applicable rules. Under Mass. R. Cir. P.\n30(b)(6), a party may notice the deposition of a corporation and describe\n\"with reasonable particularity\" the matlcr on which examination isrequested.\nIn response to such a notice, the corporation is required to \"designate one or\nmore.., persons who consent to testify on its behalf .... The persons so\ndesignated [are required to] testify as to matters known or reasonably\navailable to the organization.\" This rule was \"designed to... avoid the\npossibility that several officers and managing agents might be deposed in\nturn, with each disclaiming personal knowledge of facts that are clearly\nknown topersons within the organization and thus to the organization itself.\"\n8A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure §\n2103 (1994 ed.); see also Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, 1963\nAmendment to Fed. R. Cir. P. 30.\nA Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice satisfies the \"reasonable particularity\"\nrequirement as long as it is \"sufficient to inform [the organization] of the\nmatters which will be inquired into at the deposition so that [the organization]\ncan determine the identity and number of persons whose presence will be\nnecessary to provide an adequate response to any.., potential questions.\"\nMitsui & Co. v. Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority, 93 F.R.D. 62, 66\n\n65\n(D.P.R. 1981). In this case the Department described the subject matter on\nwhich testimony was requested as \"the factual basis for the allegations\ncontained in rite Third Amended Contempt Complaint.\" App. 510. If this\ndescription lacks \"particularity,\" that is the fault of the drafters of the\nvoluminous and wide-ranging complaint, 9°not of the Commissioner, who had\nto prepare to respond to all of those allegations at trial. See AMP, Inc. v.\nFujitsu Microelectronics, lnc., 853 F. Supp. 808, 831 (M.D. Pa. 1994), app.\ndismissed, 47 F.3d 1180 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (where subject of deposition notice\nincluded certain contentions contained in the company's counterclaims and\nanswer, \"lilt is not unreasonable to conclude that someone at [the company]\nbelieved there were factual bases for such assertions\").\nAn organization receiving such a notice \"must not only produce such\nnumber of persous as will satisfy the request, but more importantly, prepare\nthem so that they may give complete, know, ledgeable and binding answers on\nbehalf of\"the corporation.\" Marker v. Union Fidelity Life Ins. Co., 125\nF.R.D. 121o 126 (M.D.N.C. 1989). If it becomes apparent, in the course of\na depostion, that there are gaps in the witness's knowledge or memory, the\norganization must immediately substitute other witness(es) who are able to\nanswer fully and completely the questions posed. /d.; Amherst Leasing Corp.\nv. Emhart Corp., 65 F.R.D. 121, 122-23 (D. Conn. 1974); 8A Charles A.\nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure §2103 (1994 ed.).\nInthe present case, by producing only Dr. Israel, who repeatedly claimed\nlack of knowledge or memory of the factual basis for many of the factual\nallegations contained in the complaint, including particularly the allegations\nof financial harm, and then by failing to produce any other, more\nknowledgeable witnesses, BRI failed to comply with its obligations under\nthis rule. Where, as here, a corporation served with a Rule 30(b)(6)\ndeposition notice fails to comply with its obligation to produce witnesses\nwho are able to answer the questions posed fully and completely, this\n9°Asraised intheCommissioner's motion todismiss, which was deniedon the grounds\nof\"judicial economy,\" App. 54I,544, thecontemptcomplaint shouldhavebeen summarily\ndismissed on thisground, i.e., failureto comply with the requirementsthat a complaint,\nparticularly one foreonlempl, beshort,plain,andconcise.

Mitsui, 93 F.R.D. at 67; Marker,\n125 F.R.D. at 126.\nIn the circumstances of the present case, having denied the\nCommissioner's request for an order requiring BRI to produce additional,\nknowiedgeable witnesses to be deposed prior to trial, cf. Mitsui, supra;\nMarker, supra; AMP, 853 F. Supp. at 831, the only available remedy\nremaining was to preclude BRI from introducing any evidence at trial in\nsupport of the factual allegations in the complaint as to which Dr. Israel\nclaimed lack of knowledge or memory. Cf. Worthington Pump Corp. v.\nHoffert Afarine. Inc., 34 Fed. g. Serv.2d 855, 8:57 (D.N.J. 1982) (latter\nsanction imposed \"in order to insure that these [defendants] cannot attempt\nin the future to use that which they refuse to disclose now\").\nFailing to impose this remedy in these circumstances constituted a clear\nabuse of the court's discretion, which operated to the extreme prejudice of the\nCommissioner. Since, if Mr. Mullen's testimony is disregarded, there is no\nbasis for the court's findings of financial harm or for the relief that was\ngranted to remedy that harm, this abuse aione warrants vacating the court's\nremedial orders, including its award of attorneys' fees.\nB. The Court Abused Its Discretion in Excluding\nEvidence that Should Have Been Admitted Under\nthe Curative Admissibility Doctrine.\nUnder the doclrine of curative admissibility, colloquially known as the\n\"fight fire with fire\" doctrine, if one party is permitted to introduce evidence\non a particular subject, which is prejudicial to the opposing party, the\nopposing party should be permitted to rebut that evidence, even if the rebuttal\nevidence would otherwise be inadmissible. Commonwealth v. Ruffen, 399\nMass. 811,813 (1987) (reversing conviction for failure to admit evidence\n\n67\nunderthisdoctrine)9._Inthepresenctase,thecourtrepeatedlyviolatedthis\ndoctrinebypermittingBR1tointroduceevidenceonaparticularsubjectand\nthenexcludingrebuttalevidenceonthesamesubjectv,'hen proffered by the\nCommissioner.\nOne particularly prejudicial example of this type of abuse of discretion\ninvolved evidence as to the effect on the students at BRI of eliminating the\nspecialized food program (one of the conditions imposed by the\nConunissioner in his conditional certification letter of January 20, 1995, Ex.\nU-166 at 12). At the outset of the trial, in setting the grounds for relevance,\nthe court repeatedly cautioned all parties that \"[t]reatment issues are not part\nof this litigation\"; that \"the overall debate as to the use ofaversive therapies\nis not part of this litigation,\" Tr. 1:6; and that \"the issues before the\nCourt...do not directly affect students.\" Tr. 1:90. Despite these caveats, the\ncourt permitted BRI and the parents to introduce expert and lay testimony,\nover the Commissiooer's objections, as to the purportedly adverse effect on\ntwo of the students of ceasing the specialized food program. Tr. VI1:64-65,\nIX:96-97, X:6-7. How'ever, when the Commissioner moved for an order\nrequiring the guardians of those two students to consent to having the\nstudents examined by the Commissioner's expert, so that the Commissioner\ncould present rebuttal testimony on this issue, Tr. X:22-25, that motion was\ndenied on the grounds that \"[t]his is a treatment decision v:hich belongs in the\nsubstituted judgment process; itdoesn't belong here. ''92 Tr. X:25-26. When\nthe Commissioner's counsel then asked that the evidence previously\n91See also Commonwealth r.

Smith, 342 Mass. 180, 185-86 (1961) (applying this doctrine to permit\notherwise impermissible closing argument, \"to correct the erroneous impression for which\nthe defendant himself was responsible\").\n92BRI's argument in opposition to the Commissioner's motion, that any such\nexaminations \"should have been done during discovery,\" Tr. X:25, which was not addressed\nby the court, was entirely unfounded, since BRI did r_otcease using the specialized food\nprogram until ordered to do so by a Single Justice of the Appeals Court in mid-June 1995,\namonth after the close of discovery. Tr. X:25, App. 417.\n\n68\npresented by the parents on this same issue be stricken on the same ground,\nthat motion was also denied. Tr. X:26.\nThe court's refusal to permit the Commissioner's expert to examine these\ntwo students and to provide expert testimony on this issue was seriously\nprejudicial, since the court's finding that these two students \"are currently\nsuffering a dramatic increase in their health-dangerous behaviors,\" F. 298,\nApp. 1284-85, is the court's only finding of concrete, physical harm to any\nstudents resulting from the Commissioner's conduct. As discussed in\nArgument IV.A, infra, there is no way that the remaining findings of\nharm--economic harm to BRI and resulting decrease in special rewards and\nindividual attention to smdents93---_ould justify the drastic injunctive and\nreceivership relief imposed by the court. Accordingly, the court's failure to\npermit the Commissioner to introduce evidence on this subject warrants\nvacating this relief.\nAnother example of the prejudicial exclusion of rebuttal evidence was the\ncourt's disparate treatment of evidence concerning DMR's regulation of\nproviders other than BRI. One of the central themes of BRrs case was that\nBRI was treated differently from other providers, App. 987-90; and BRI was\npermitted to ask many questions as to DMR's ordinary practices with respect\nto other providers. E.g., Tr. !II:11, 154, 190, 193, i94, 200, 209, 226, 250,\n258, 265; IV:35, 46, 84, 211-12; VI:I09-10, 171,192. However, when DMR\nattempted to introduce evidence as to DMR's usual investigation practices in\norder to rebut BRI's evidence of disparate treatment, BRI objected on the\ngrounds of relevance. Tr. XIIA:I41. Those objections were sustained, and\nthe court repeatedly instructed the Commissioner's counsel to limit her\nquestions solely to DMR's investigations concerning BRI students. Tr.\nXIIA:141-43, 148, 149._ Since the court made many findings that DMR\ntreated BRI differently from other providers, particularly with respect to\n93Moreover, as shown in Argument III.B.21, infra, all of these findings of harm are\ndearly erroneous, even on the existing record.\n94See also Tr.

R. Cir. P. 52(a), a trial court's findings of fact will not be set\naside by an appellate court \"unless clearly erroneous.\" Cox v. New England\nTel. & Tel Co., 414 Mass. 374, 384 (1993). However, \"there is and should\nbe certain leeway in applying the standard to varying cases,\" Louts Dreyfus\n& Cie. v. Panama Canal Co., 298 F.2d 733, 738 (Sth Cir. 1962), cited with\napproval in Cormier v. Carry, 381 Mass. 234, 236 n. 4 (1980); see also\nMarkell v. Sidney B. Pfeifer Foundation, Inc., 9 Mass. App. Ct. 412, 417\n(1980), in light of the underlying purposes of requiring fact finding by the\ntrial court. Those purposes are to: (1) insure the quality of ajudge's decision\nmaking process by requiring simultaneous articulation of the judge's\nunderlying reasoning; (2) assure the parties that their claims have been fully\nand fairly considered; and (3) inform an appellate court of the basis on which\na decision has been reached. Cormier, 381 Mass. at 236.\nAs repeatedly recognized by this Court, the practice followed by the trial\ncourt in this case, of adopting almost verbatim the proposed findings of the\n\n71\nprevailing part)', \"defeat[s] each of these three underlying purposes.'\"\nCormier, id.; see also Commonwealth v.

It is particularly problematic\nfor a trial court to adopt verbatim a party's proposed findings on the\ncredibility of _sitnesses, \"in view of both the need for such assessments to be\nmade dispassionately and the difficulty an appellate court necessarily\nencounters when forced to assess the credibility ofwimesses solely on the\nbasis of a 'cold' record.\" Cormier, 381 Mass. at 237 n. 7. Where this\ndisfavored practice is followed, the appellate court is faced with the increased\nburden of conducting a painstaking review of the entire record of the lower\ncourt proceedings, in order to ensure that the trial court's findings are actually\nsupported by the underlying evidence.

Although some subsidiary proposed findings\nare omitted, some paragraphs are moved around, and some minor changes are\nmade in wording or punctuation, the trial court made virtually no changes of\nany substance in adopting these findings. The same is true of the trial court's\ncorollary findings and conclusions of law. _°_ Cf. Lewis v. Emerson, 391\nMass. at 524 (\"to be proper a judgment must give evidence of independent\njudicial consideration of the issues, not merely a slavish reliance on a party's\nview of the law\"). Even typographical errors in dates and quotations in the\nproposed findings and inapt case citations in the proposed conclusions are\nadopted verbatim by the court) °7 Thus, the court's findings lack the\n\"evidence of independent judicial consideration of the issues,\" Lewis v.\nEmerson, 391 Mass. at 524, that is the necessary predicate for the ordinary,\nmore deferential level of appellate review under the clearly erroneous\nstandard.\nW41ndeetLas indicated inthe introduction to the coutqs findings, the court's findings cite\nonly to the uncontested exhibits and those introduced by BRI, and not to a single one of\nDMR's 80 exhibits. App. 1208 n.2.\n1°SCognizant of this Court's warning that an appellate court need not assume that the\ntrial court has adopted aparty'sproposed findings verbatim where proposed findings are not\ncontained in the record appendix, Cormier, 381 Mass. at 236 n. 4, the Commissioner has\nincluded all parties' proposed findings in the Appendix, App. 634-1130. Inaddition, in a\nseparately bound Addendum to Argument Ill, the Commissioner has reproduced, side-by-\nside, the proposed findings of BRI and the corresponding findings of the trial court.\nJ°6Compare App. 1287-93 and App. 904-17; App. 1294-1320 andApp. 1020.\n1°7See infra at 78 n. 113 (misciting cases); 83 n. 118 (misciting cases); 91 n. 129\n(inaccurate date); 94 n. 137 (inaccurate date); 96 n. 140 (inaccurate quotation).\n\n74\n2. Strict Scrutiny of the Trial Court's Factual\nFindings Is Warranted for Other Reasons as\nWell\nApart from the verbatim adoption problem discussed above, there are\nseveral additional circumstances that require this Court to take a particularly\nhard look at the trial court's factual findings in this case. First, because the\nevidence in this ease was largely documentary--and even the oral testimony\nconsisted largely of descriptions and explanations of documents contained in\nthe record*°8--this Court is free to draw its own conclusions from the\nevidence. Markell, 9 Mass. App. Ct. at 418; see also Strand v. Herrick &\nSmith, 396 Mass. 783, 789 n. 6 (1986) (reserving question whether clearly\nerroneous standard applies to appellate review of findings based on\ndocumentary evidence). Moreover, to the extent that the trial court's\n'Tmdings of fact\" are, instead, unsupported characterizations or inferences,\nwhich is largely the case here, they \"are entitled to no weight from this\ncourt.\" Simon v. Weymouth Agricultural & Industrial Society, 389 Mass.\n146, 148 (1983); see also Heinrich _:Silvernail, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 229\n(1986), review denied, 399 Mass. 1101 (1987) (rejecting characterizations\nand inferences not based on \"solid foundation of established facts\"). And, of\ncourse, this court is not bound by the trial court's conclusions of law, Simon,\n389 Mass. at 149, 151, even if characterized as findings of\"fact\" by the\njudge. Strand, 396 Mass. at 783 n. 5 (in determining applicable standard of\nappellate review, reviewing court may disregard form of trial court's\n\"findings\" and \"conclusions\").\nMore substantively, a closer than usual look at the trial court's findings\nis warranted here because of the subject matter of the findings and the\nseverity of the relief predicated upon them. As discussed above, the trial\ncourt's legal conclusion of contempt was based largely on findings of bad\nl°SAs recognized by the trial court, \"This litigation was somewhat unusual due to the\nfact that the actions of all parties are fully documented in the[I exhibits,\" App. 1208 n. 2,\n\n75\nfaith on the part of the Commissioner and his staff: Because \"It]here is ever,:'\npresumption in favor of the honesty and sufficiency of the motives actuating\npublic officers in actions ostensibly taken for the general welfare,\" LaPointe,\n389 Mass. at 459, this Court should carefully scrutinize the evidence\nunderlying the trial court's findings of bad faith to ensure that there was an\nadequate basis for overcoming this presumption to the contrary. If not, those\nfindings should be overturned. Cf. Stamper v. Stanwood, 339 Mass. 549, 553\n(1959) (relying, in large part, on presumption that marriage was entered into\nin good faith, appellate court rejects trial court's factual finding to the\ncontrary as based on \"meager\" evidence).\nSimilarly, because of the far-reaching receivership relief imposed by the\ntrial court, it is particularly important for this Court to scrutinize the factual\nfindings on which that relief was predicated, to ensure that such a drastic\nremedy was, in fact, warranted by the underlying evidence. See Arguments\nIII.B.21 and IV.A.I, infra. As this Court has repeatedly warned, \"[P]articular\ncare must be exercised...in order to ascertain that facts exist which\njustify...the appointment of a temporary or permanent receiver.\" Lopez v.\nMedford CommuniO, Center, Inc., 384 Mass. 163, 169 (1981) (quoting\nGeorge Altman, Inc. v. Vogue lnternationale, Inc., 366 Mass. 176, 179\n(1974)).\nB. Careful Scrutiny of the Record Reveals That All of\nthe Trial Court's Adverse Factual Findings Are\nClearly Erroneous.\nFor the reasons discussed in Argument I,supra, virtually all of the court's\nfactual findings are immaterial to the legal issues that were properly before\nthe court in this contempt proceeding--i.e., whether the Commissioner\ndirectly and undoubtedly violated any clear and unequivocal provision of the\nSettlement Agreement. However, because the court's findings of misconduct\nare so serious on their face and so personally damaging to the Commissioner\nand other public officials, the Commissioner asks this Court to take the\nadditional step of carefully scrutinizing those findings and comparing them\n\n76\nto the underlying evidence in the record, under the standards articulated\naboveJ 09\nAccordingly, this section points out the evidence, if any, that is pertinent\nto the trial court's findings on various subjects, roughly in the order that those\nsubjects were addressed by the trial court, and shows that there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support the factual findings made or inferences drawn by the\ntrial court. In many cases, this argument will shov,' that other evidence in the\nrecord, which was disregarded by the trial court, unequivocally establishes\nthe oppositeofwhatthecourt found. \"° In order to assist the Court in\nundertaking this review, the Commissioner has filed herewith a separately\nbound Addendum to Argument Ill. That Addendum is organized into 21\nsections, corresponding to the following 21 subsections ofArgument III.B.\nEach section of the Addendum contains, side-by-side, the relevant trial court\nfindings and the corresponsing proposed findings of BRI, from which the\nI°gE','en the introductory paragraphs and the Procedural Back_'ound section of the\ncourt's findings, App. 1207-09, which were also adopted from Bgl's proposed findings, App.\n\"148-50, contain factual errors that, while immaterial tothis appeal, indicate the pervasive\nextent of the court's errors. For example: (I) While the court finds that the contempt\ncomplaint was\"brought by [BRI] and theparents and guardians of students at IBR1],\" F. I,\nApp. 1207, in fact, thecontempt complaint was brought only by BRI. App. 1207. (2) While\nthe court finds that\"DMR voluntarily entered into the Settlement Agreement,\" F. 3,App.\n1208, in fact, DMR didnot seek to become a \"party\" butmoved only to substitute itself for\nDMH (which was not a party to the Senlement Agreement but nevertheless had certain\nlimited obligations thereunder). App. 1208. (3) While the court found that the preliminary\ninjunction and the supporting findings entered by the court in 1988 were \"affirmed in a\ndecision of the Single Justice of the Appeals Court,\" F.6n. 4,App. 1209, in fact, the Single\nJustice simply denied a request for interlocutory relief from the preliminary injunction\npending plenary review by a full panel ofthe Appeals Court (which never occurred bccaas¢\nof the intervening Senlement Agreement). App. 109-17.\n110Whet e the trial court has not made findings on factual issues that this Court deems\nsignificant, this Court may make additional findings based on its own review of the\nevidence. Building Inspector ofLancaster v. Sanderson, 372 Mass. 157, 161 (1977); In the\nMatter of Jane A., 36 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 23? (1994).\n\n77\ncourt's findings were adopted, followed by copies of the pertinent transcript\npages and exhibits, m\nAs will be seen in the following subsections, man)' of the factual errors\nmade by the court fall into the following pattern: First, the court adopts\nBRI's mischaracterizations ofa witness's trial testimony and of that witness's\nprior testimony (either at a deposition or earlier in the trial), then finds some\nminor inconsistency between the present and past testimony (as\nmischaracterized), and then infers from this \"inconsistency\" that the witness\ndeliberately lied. See, e.g., subsections 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, infra. Often the\n\"inconsistencies\" identified by the court are not between the witness's own\nwords on different occasions but between the witness's \"yes\" and \"no\"\nanswers to different leading questions or between the wimess's monosyllabic\nanswers to leading questions and the witness's narrative testimony fully\nexplaining the matter in question. See, e.g., subsections 2, 4, 12, 13, infro.\nAnd, frequently, the \"falsehoods\" amount to no more than the contrast\nbetween a witness's lack of memory at a deposition and the witness's\nrefreshed memory al trial. See, e.g., subsections 3, 13, infra.\n1. DMR Did Not Contest Its Status As a Part),\nto This Case. m\nDMR never argued in the trial court that it was not a party to or was not\nbound by the Settlement Agreement. Nevertheless, throughout its findings,\nthe court repeatedly finds that DMR took this position and infers from this\nrathe findings,proposedfindings, transcripts,andexhibits arealso reproducedintheir\nentirety inthe Appendix, Exhibits, orTranscriptvolumes also filedherewith.\nn2The trialcourt's findingsonthissubject, F. 12,17,23, 35,65, 114;App. 1211-14,\n1217, 1225, 1236, 1237, areadoptedfrom BRI*sproposed findings22, 28,34, 51, 54, 96,\n169;App. 748, 750, 752,758, 770, 791.\n\n78\npurportedly \"abrupt[] change[],\" F. 12, App. 121 I, that the Commissioner\nwas acting in bad faithY _\nIn moving to dismiss the contempt complaint, the Commissioner\nexpressly assumed that DMR is a party to this case (although he did reserve\nthe right to argue otherwise at some later time), u4 App. 374-75. Similarly,\nnowhere in the Commissioner's proposed findings and conclusions is there\nany factual or legal claim that DMR or the Commissioner is not a party to the\nSettlement Agreement or to this case. App. 634-741.\nThe only \"evidence\" in the record on this issue are the Commissioner's\nanswers to questions by BRI's counsel as to his understanding of whether\nDMR is a party to the Settlement Agreement. His counsel objected to those\nquestions, as irrelevant and as calling for legal conclusions or privileged\ncommunications, but those objections were overruled. Tr. II1:25; IV:171-72,\n174, 175, 176. In response to such questions, the Commissioner\ndemonstrated only his own personal lack of understanding of this essentially\nlegal issue. Tr. III:22-25 (acknowledging inconsistency between his\nunderstanding and positions taken on his behalf by his attorneys in\nli_lnitsconclusionosflaw,App. 1294-1300,adoptedfromBRI'sproposedconclusions,\nApp. 1002-09, the court held that the doclrine ofequitableestoppel bars DMR from arguing\nthat it is not aparty to the Settlement Agreement, citing, inter alia. McAndrew v. School\nCommiltee of Cambridge, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 356 0985). However, in McAndrew, the\nAppeals Court specifically noted and reatTumed the tnglitional judicial reluctance \"to apply\nprinciples of estoppel to pubic entities where to do so would negate requirements of law\nintended to protect the public interest,\" and found itparticularly inappropriate to apply this\ndocWine to estop agovernment body, in that case the Cambridge School Committee, \"where\na government official acts, or makes representations, contrary to astatute or regulation\ndesigned to prevent favoritism, secure honest bidding, or ensure some other legislative\npurpose.\" ld. Another case, Peoples Savings Bank v. Board ofAssessor.r of Chicopee, 384\nMass. 808, 809 (1981), cited by BRI, App. 1007-09, and the court, App. 1299, on the issue\nof equitable estoppel, has nothing whatever to dowith the application or non-applicatiun to\nthe government of that doctrine. Rather, it deals solely with the admissibility of anexpert\nopinion in ataxpayer's appeal to the Appellate Tax Board.\n114TheCommissioner asserted, as one of 12 affu'mative defenses in his answer and\nmotion to dismiss the third amended contempt complaint, that he (not DMR) was \"not a\nproper party\" to the contempt complaint (not the Settlement Agreement or the underlying\ncase), App. 361,486, but that defense was notpressed below and is not raised here.\n\n79\ncorrespondence and briefs); 111:48(acknowledging that he was \"not clear\" as\nto whether he was a part) to the Settlement Agreement); IV:172 (stating that\nhe is \"confused about that question\" and that \"it's difficult, not being an\nattorney, to know what each of the documents means relative to the question\"\nof DMR's party status). At the very most, his testimony on this subject\nestablishes that at some point DMR considered taking the position that it was\nnot a party but, apparently, that suggestion was either never communicated\nto or was rejected by the Attorney General, who has sole authority to\nrepresent state officials in litigation and to formulate litigation strategy on\ntheir behalf. Tr. IV:173-77 (citing G.L c. 12, § 3).\nThus, the court's \"factual\" findings that DMR took the legal position that\nit was not a party to the Settlement Agreement are clearly erroneous and\ntherefore cannot be the basis for inferring a bad faith motive on the part of the\nCommissioner or his counsel, us\nHSEven if the Commissioner had changed his position on this issue, it isdoubtful that\nthis would constitute contempt, particularly given the legitimate questions raised by the\nmanner in which the court made DMR a \"part)\"' to this case and to the Settlement\nAgreement and the interlocutory nature of the order in question. See Prior Proceedings,\nsubsection 2, supra. Cf Evans v. City of Chicago, 10 F.3d at 478 (government officials\ncannot contract away statutory authorib' of successors, \"especially when one of'the parties'\ndid not consent.\")\n\n80\n1 The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor Rejecting the Recommendations of a\nStaff Review Team and for Seeking\nAdditional Information Before Acting on\nBRI's Application for Recertifica_ion. It6\nIn August 1993, as described in the Statement of Facts, subsections I and\n2. the Commissioner rejected the recommendations of a staff review team\nthat BRI be re-certified to use Level !11 aversives and decided, instead, to\nseek further information from BILl before taking final action on its re+\ncertification application. Pending receipt and reviewofthat information, the\nConm_issioner granted BPd interim re-certification, Ex. U-82. The court's\nfindings that this decision was made in bad faith, F. 49, 52; App. 1221, 1222,\nare clearly erroneous,\nThe trial court found that DMR sent in a second review team\nunnecessarily and under false pretenses, finding that the first team had\nreviewed both the GED-4 and the specialized food program, so that no\nfurther review was necessary. F. 42, 45, App. 1219, 1220. In fact, however,\nas George Casey testified, the fast team examined only the GED (Graduated\nElectronic Decelerator, a device used to shock students as a means of\neliminating targeted behaviors), not the GED-4 (a new and more powerful\nversion of that device). Tr. 1:118. Attorney Cascy also testified that he never\nsaw an5'application of the GED or any other painful aversive, Tr. 1:IgG, and\nthat he knew only that a food program existed but did not go into it in detail.\nTr.

As to the specialized food program, Attorney Casey testified\nonly that he believed he saw treatment plans which included references to\n\"specialized food.\" ld\n1+6\"I'hetrial court's findings on this subject, F. 42-55, App. 1219-22, are adopted from\nBgl's proposed findings 68, 70-73, 75-79, 81-82; App. 771,772-73,774-76, 777.\n\n81\nMost of the court's findings on this subject focus on the Commissioner's\ndecision to reject the staffreview team's recommendations. \"7 The evidence\nestablished that the Commissioner had good reasons for seeking more\ninformation prior to acting on BRI's application. The trial court ignored this\nevidence and found the team's reports to be thorough and complete, F. 48, 51;\nApp. 1221, 1222, despite the lack of any expert testimony to that effect.\nIn particular, the court erred in finding that the review team conducted a\n\"thorough\" investigation of the GED and specialized food programs. F. 48,\nApp. 1221. In fact, the review team relied almost exclusively on information\nand documentation provided to them by BRI staff, rather than on first-hand\nobservations. Attorney Casey testified, without contradiction, that the team\ndid not observe the application of any Level I11 aversives. Tr. !:143-144,\n186. He also testified, again without contradiction, that he never observed\nthe \"make-up\" meal element of the specialized food program, and that he did\nnot go to any residences or review any videotapes of BRI's residential\ntreatment program, ld. at 187, 147-48. The staff reviewers made no first-\nhand observations of staff training, delivery of medical services, human rights\ncommittee meetings, or peer review committee meetings during either of\ntheir two visits to BRI. ld. 182-83. Given the unique nature of BRI's\nprogram, and the highly intrusive procedures involved, the Commissioner\nhad good cause to reject recommendations that were based on little more than\na paper review.\nThe court's findings regarding the \"completeness\" of the 1993 report are\ndirectly contradicted by the report itself and Attomey Casey's testimony. F.\n49-51, 54-55; App. 1221-22, 1223. The report itself states that misfirings of\nthe GED, although not dangerous to health, might affect the clinical\neffectiveness of the BRI program, and that no analysis by the team\npsychologist was available on this issue, due to his resignation prior to the\ntS'lAsdiscussed in Argument I.E,supra, in second-guessing the Commissioner's\njudgment and exploring his underlying motivations,the courtexceeded the proper bounds\nofjudicial rev.ew ofexecutive decisionmaking. Moreover, because BRInever availed itself\nof itsstatutoryright toadministrative andjudicial review of any of the regulatory actions at\nissue here, the courterred inundertakingany review of the merits of those decisions.\n\n82\nreceiptofthepertinenitnformation. Ex. U-75 at 6-7. While Attorney Casey\ntestified that he considered the 1993 report to be \"complete,\" in the sense that\nhe had completed what he understood his task to be, Tr. 1:128-129, he also\ntestified that he was concerned about the impact of misfires on the efficacy\nof the treatment. /d. at 190-91. However, because the team psychologist was\nunavailable to review the data, Attorney Ca.sey submitted the report without\nany competent clinical opinion on this issue. Id.\nIn finding that the Commissioner's only justification for considering the\n1993 report \"incomplete\" was the fact that it was not signed by Dr. Reilly, F.\n54, App. 1223, the trial court ignored the Commissioner's testimony that he\nreceived advice from his general counsel describing the report and its\ndeficiencies. Tr. 111:77-79. The Commissioner testified that the lack of Dr.\nReilly's signature was \"partially\" why he considered the report incomplete\nbut was not the only reason, ld at 78-79, 84.\nFurthermore, the report itself identifies a serious deficiency, Ex. U-75 at\n6-7, that is, the absence of any psychologist's input. Tr. V:49-50. DMR's\npractice was to seek input from a psychologist in the certification process.\nTr, V:23-24. Because a major component of DMR's certification\nrequirements involves the application of technical psychological standards\nto the applicant's program, 104 C.M.R. § 20.15 (4), requiring psychologist's\nparticipation in evaluating the relevant information would appear essential;\nand there was no evidence indicating that it was unreasonable to do so.\nAlso, some of the information provided by BRI itselfconflicted with the\nreports' conclusions that BRI was complying with regulations. BRI sent\nDMR a letter in which BR1 admitted that four students had received\nmechanical restraint prior to any authorization for such restraint by a court in\na substituted judgment order. Ex. DMR-17 at 20. In this same letter, BRI\nacknowledged that it had not been forwarding reports on the use of\nmechanical restraint t° DMR as required bY DMR's regulati°ns\" ld. at 20-21.\nThe trial court also erred in finding that the 1991 and 1993 certification\nteam reports were never read by any of the key individuals who were making\ndecisions on BRI's certification. F. 52, App. 1222. The Commissioner\ntestified that he ordinarily received certification reports through his general\n\n83\ncounsel,whoseroleit wastocheck the reports against the regulations and\nadvise him as to w'hether the regulations were met by the applicant. Tr. V:24.\nAttorney Casey, an assistant general counsel at DMR, testified that he\nsubmitted the BR1 report to the general counsel, Tr. 1:192; and, consistently,\nthe Commissioner testified that. in the case of BRI, he received an extensive\nmemorandum from his general counsel summarizing the certification team's\nefforts and attaching the report itself. Tr. V:39, 41. Based largely on his\ngeneral counsel's advice, the Commissioner rejected the certification teams'\nrecommendation. Tr. V:52. tls\nThe Commissioner also received clinical advice from Assistant\nCommissioner Mary Cerreto regarding the adequacy of the reports. After\nlearning about the certification teams' methods and drawing conclusions\nbased on those discussions, Dr. Cerreto advised the Commissioner that the\nreports were insufficient to evaluate the BRI program. Tr. X:43-44. *.9\ntlSln its conclusions of law, App. 1301-02, adopted from BRI's proposed conclusions,\nApp. 1091, the court held that advice of counsel is not a defense toan action for contempt.\nIt also concluded that proof of willfulness is not required in a civil contempt proceeding.\nApp. 1301. However, the case which the court cited regarding the advice of counsel\ndefense, United States v.Armstrong, 781 F.2d 700, 706 (gth Cir. 1986), was a criminal\ncontempt case in which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appoals held that counsel's advice to\ndisobey a courl order isnot a defense to criminal contempt, in that it does not negate the\nexistence of willfulness, an essential element of the crime of contempt. The Court of\nAppeals held \"[allthough a defendant's good faith belief that he iscomplying with the order\nof the court may prevent a finding ,_f willfulness, good faith reliance on the advice of\ncounsel to disobey a court order v,ill not.\" The court's reliance on United States v.\nUnderw_', 880 F.2d 612 (Ist Cir. 1989), was misplaced for precisely the same reason. As\nheld by this Court in dives v. Braintree, 341 Mass. at 12,advice of counsel isadefense to\ncivil contempt, particularly where the defendant isa public official who ispresumed to act\nin good faith.\nHgEven d_sbe|ief of the just-de!icribed evidence of the basis for the Commissioner's\ndecision toreject the team's recommendations could not support the court's contrary finding\nthat the decisim, was motivated, instead, by bad faith. Atkinson, 33 Mass. App. Ct. at 225.\nMoreover, to the extent that the court tmdenook to review the legal or clinical merit of the\nCommissioner's decision, such an undertaking exceeded the much more limited scope of this\ncontempt proceeding.\n\n84\nAs the reports' ultimate recommendations were rejected by the\nDepartment based on legal and clinical advice, Tr. V:52, X:43-44, the trial\ncourt's conclusion, that a failure to include the authors of the report in further\ndiscussions demonstrated the Commissioner's bad faith, is clearly erroneous.\nF. 52, App. 1222. The only certification team member with any\nqualifications to comment on the efficacy of BRI's treatment, the\npsychologist Dr. Reilly, was no longer a DMR employee, Tr. I:121,190-9 I;\nand other, higher-ranking DMR psychologists, including Dr. Cerreto, were\nqualified and more readily available to provide such advice.\n3. The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor the Statements Contained in His Letter of\nAugust 6, 1993. _\nOn August 6, 1993, Commissioner Campbell issued a letter extending\nBRI's certification for 25 days. This letter primarily asked BRI to supply\nDMR with additional information. The Commissioner also identified\ndeficiencies which BR! was to correct immediately. In the same letter, the\nCommissioner informed BRI that, assuming BRI met these requirements, the\nCommissioner would extend BRi's certification for another 25 days, to allow\nDMR to analyze the submitted information and compkte the review process.\nEx. U-82.\nThe evidence introduced at trial detailed the Commissioner's good faith\nbasis for the August 6, 1993 letter. However, the trial court ignored this\nevidence and issued findings based on misstatements of the record,\ncontradicted by the record, and unsupported by the record. These findings\nI2°The trial court's findings on this subject, F. 63-81, App. 1224-29, are adopted from\nBRI's proposed findings 93-94, 96, 100-03, 105, 108, 113, 115-17, 120-27; App. 782-83,\n785-87,789, 791-92,795-98.\n\n85\nare unrelated to any obligation of DMR under the Settlement Agreement and\ninunaterial to the contempt action but, in any event, are clearly erroneous. _2:\nThe Commissioner relied on advice from his staff in issuing the letter,\nwhich was primarily a request for further information. Tr. I11:113-14, 117;\nV:53; Ex. U-82. In addition, the Commissioner had also received disturbing\ncommunications from the DMR Human Rights Advisory Committee, Ex. U-\n42, 59, 60, 62, and a copy of a letter from Dr. Paul Jansen (an outside\npsychologist who had evaluated some BR1 students in connection with\nsubstituted judgment proceedings in the Probate Court), Ex. U-g l, regarding\nconditions at BRI. Contrary to the trial court's findings, evidence at trial\nestablished that the Commissioner's request for information and statement of\ndeficiencies were entirely warranted under the circumstances.\nMany of the court's findings concerning the August 6 letter are based on\nthe erroneous premise that any statement in the Commissioner's letter which\nconflicts with the findings of the 1991 or 1993 certification team reports was\nnot only incorrect but intentionally misleading. F. 64, 66, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76;\nApp. 1224-25, 1227-28. These findings ignore the substantial testimony\nregarding the deficiencies in the reports, discussed in the preceding\nsubsection, which led the Commissioner to reject the recommendations\ncontained in those reports and to seek further information. As the court never\n12lOne example of an utterly immaterial, yet inflammatory, finding istaken verbatim\nfrom BRI's proposed finding 125, App. 797, and identifies a purported inconsistency\nbetween the Commissioner's deposition and trial testimony as to whether the Department\ntook any steps to substantiate allegations against BRI contained in a letter attached to the\nAugust 6, 1993 letter.F. 79 n2I,App. 1229. The August 6 letter itself asks BRI to respond\nto the allegations, Ex. U-g2; and at trial, the Commisssioner so testified. Tr. 111:176.\nApparently Commissioner Campbell had forgotten abOut this aspect of the August 6 letter\nat the time of his deposition, and testified accordingly at that time. ld at 176-78. There is\nno logical reason to fmd that the Commissioner intentionally falsified his deposition or trial\ntestimony on this subject. However, the trial court adopted BPd's characterization of this\nmemory lapse as intentional. F. 79 n.2I, App. 1229. See Cormier, 38| Mass. at 237 n. 7\n(noting particular importance of trial court's careful consideration in making findings\nregarding credibility).\n\n86\nfound the certification reports to be accurate, m no factual basis exists to\nsupport findings of bad faith on the part of the Commissioner, simply because\nhis statements conflict with those of the staff reviewers. In the absence of\nany independent basis for inferring an improper motive, there is nothing\ninherently improper about file Commissioner rejecting the recommendations\nof his field slaff, based on the advice of his general counsel and assistanl\ncommissioner. To the contrary, reliance on such advice demonstrates his\ngood faith. SeeAIves, 341 Mass. at 12.\nThe court's findings concerning the accuracy of various statements\ncontained in the August 6 letter are also clearly erroneous. For instance, the\nAugust 6 letter stated that the certification team \"felt unable to reach a\nconclusion on whether the issue of GED misfires presented a problem for\n[BRI's] ability to comply with [DMR's behavior modification regulations].\"\nAlthough the trial court found the statement to be false, F. 70, App. 1226, the\nstatement was supported by both the certification report itself, Ex. U-75 at 6-\n7, and the testimony of Attorney Casey, the author of the report. The\ntestimony on this issue proceeded as follows:\nQ. So I ask you again: When the Commissioner states that the\nteam failed to reach a conclusion on this issue, would you\nagree that's not an accurate statement? It's misleading, is it\nnot, Mr. Casey?\nA. Well, your question is misleading, too. i was unable to form\na conclusion about the GED, and I think I put that in the\nreport. I don't know what else rm supposed to say. In the\nsense that I didn't know what effect the misfires had.\nTr. l:153. The court either ignored Mr. Casey's testimony or discounted it for\nan unstated reason, m In either case there exists a clear conflict between\nuncontroverted testimony and the court's findings.\nIZZThetrial court never foundthe factual orlegal conclusionsof either report to be\ncorrect. The courtonly foundthat thereports were thorough\" and\"complete.\" F. 51,48;\nApp. 1222, 1221.\n123AttorneyCasey wastheonlyDMR employee the courtexpresslyfoundto becredible.\nApp, 1292 n. 76.\n\n87\nThe court criticized the Commissioner for asking BRI to provide a list of\naversive procedures currently in use (along with a description of how the\ntechniques were used at BRI) and copies of, or citations to, peer-reviewed\nprofessional research specific to each such technique. F. 73, App. 1227. Tiffs\nrequest was patently reasonable in light of DMR's obligation to judge\nwhether BRI's use of such techniques complied with applicable laws and\nregulations. The court found the request unnecessary because, according to\nthe court, Attorney Casey testified that this material had been reviewed\npreviously, ld Although Attorney Casey testifed that there were\ndescriptions of aversive procedures in the materials he reviewed, Tr. 1:161,\nthe record provides no support for the court's conclusion that what Mr. Casey\npreviously reviewed accurately described the procedures in use at BRI in\nAugust 1993. Regarding peer-reviewed research, Attorney Casey testified\nonly that he believed Dr. Reilly read something, but Mr. Casey did not know\nwhat Dr. Reilly was given or read. ld. at 162-63. BRI introduced r.o\nevidence from which the court could conclude that Dr. Reilly had reviewed\nthe material requested in the Commissioner's August 6 letter, and the reports\nthemselves contain no such information.\nl'he court made similarly erroneous findings regarding the\nCommissioner's statement that DMR had not \"been able to conclude that the\nGED, the _,pecialized food program, or other painful interventions . . .\neffective.., or that their use by BRI is consistent with [relevant regulations],\nor the fundamental principles irdbrming the DMR regulations .... Nor [had\nthey] concluded to the contrary.\" Ex. U-82 at 2. The trial court attacks this\nstatement as inconsistent with earlier Probate Court findings on the\neffectiveness of such procedures. F. 67 n. 18, 69; App. 1225-25.\nThe court faults the Commissioner both for contradicting those Probate\nCourt findings and for \"deliberate[ly] ignor[ing]\" the opinions of\npsychologists hired by the Department to report to the Probate Court in\nindividual substituted judgment proceedings, Id. However, although these\nprivate psychologists are provided by DMR, pursuant to Part A of the\nSettlement Agreement, App. 125, they report to the court, not to DMR, Ex.\nBRI-I 3, which was not participating in the Probate Court proceedings at that\n\n88\ntime.F.22,App.1214.Therefore, there was no reason for the court to infer\nthat DMR had copies of those reports, much less that DMR deliberately\nignored them. Even assuming that these reports were provided to DMR,\nthere was no evidence that DMR had \"ignored\" them, only that the\nCommissioner himself had not personally read them. Tr. 111:38-43. In any\nevent, the Commissioner would not have been bound by those psychologists'\nopinions as to BRl's compliance with DMR regulations, one of the\nunresolved issues identified in the August 6th letter. Ex. U-82 at 2.\nWhile the trial court found the Commissioner's statement concerning\nefficacy to be baseless, F. 69, App. 1226, in fact, his August 6th letter itself\ndetailed the basis for DMR's inability to resolve the issue of efficacy. Ex. U-\n82) 24 As explained in the letter and as discussed in subsection 2, supra, the\nstaff review teams had not reviewed the implementation of Level Ill\nprocedures first hand and did not reach a conclusion as to whether misfirings\npresented problems for the efficacy of treatment. Absent evidence to the\ncontrary, there was no basis for the court to find that statement to be \"without\nfactual basis,\" much less \"in deliberate ignorance\" of other available\ninformation. F. 69, App. 1226.\n4. DMR Acted Appropriately inAnticipation of,\nand in Response to, a Nationwide Television\nProgram Concerning BRI and DMR. 12s\nThe trial court found that the Commissioner's \"position[s] concerning\nboth the Settlement Agreement and the [BRI] program\" were improperly\nmotivated by his \"concern as to how his agency might be depicted\" in an\nupcoming television program (\"the Connie Chung Show\") on BRI, and that\n)_4No evidence was introduced in the contempt trial to establish the falsity of the\nreasons stated in the August 6 letter, so the letter itself, anuncontested exhibit admitted for\nthe truth of itscontents, isthe only evidence on the issue.\n12S'l-hetrial court's findings on this subject, F. 58-62, App. 1222-24, areadopted from\nBR.I'sproposed findings 88-92, App. 780-g2.\n\n89\nthe Commissioner testified falsely on this subject. F. 61, 62; App. 1224.\nThese findings are not only vdthout an), basis in the evidence but grossly\nmischaracterize the little evidence presented on this subject.\nIn response to a series of leading questions posed by BRI's attorney, the\nCommissioner testified that, in the \"course of performing his regulator)'\nduties, [he did not] take into account the effects of the upcoming CBS\ntelevision program... ,\" that he \"was not motivated by [the CBS program],\"\nand that he \"never did anything in connection with [the television program],[]\nconcerning BRI, concerning the regulation ofBRL\" Tr. 111:206 (emphasis\nadded).\nBRrs counsel began to mischaracterize this testimony immediately, ld\nat 250-51. The Commissioner resisted this mischaracterization on the\nwitness stand, Tr. IV:47; however, it is this very mischaracterization which\nwas incorporated into both BRI's proposed fmding of fact 91, App. 781, and\nthe trial court's finding. F. 61, App. 1224, A full reading of the series of\nleading questions posed to the Commissioner and his responses makes clear\nthe central point of his testimony on this issue: his regulation of BRl was not\nmotivated by the television program, j26 Tr. 11I:206.\nThe court's adverse findings on this subject all rest on the erroneous\npremise that the Commissioner testified that he \"never did anything\" in\nanticipation of the television program. F. 61, App. 1224. Although, as just\ndiscussed, he testified that his regulatory actions with respect to BRI were not\nmotivated by the television program, Tr. 111:206; he never denied doing\n\"anything\" in anticipation of that show. In fact, earlier in the same day, the\nCommissioner testified, as the court found, F. 60, App. 1224, that he had\ndiscussed the upcoming television program with the Under-Secretary of the\nExecutive Office of Health and Human Services. Tr. i11:57-59. The\nCommissioner also readily agreed that DMR planned to draft letters to be\nsent to parents in anticipation of, and response to, the CBS program and that\n126The trial court's disbelief of the Commissioner's testimony on this subject does not\nprovide support for the contrary finding, that his regulation of BRI was, in fact, motivated\nby this television program. F. 62, App. 1224. See Levine v. Amber Manuf Co., 6 Mass.\nApp. Ct. 840, 841 (1978).\n\n90\nthe DMR press office prepared to respond to media inquiries, n7 Tr. IV:47-51.\nThese activities were neither improper nor inconsistent with the\nCommissioner's testimony that his regulation of BRI was not motivated by\nthis television show.\n5. DMR Had a Good Faith Basis for Seeking\nInformation about the Court Monitor's\nFinancial Relationships with BRA's\nAttorneys and Their Clients._2s\nThe trial court's finding that DMR engaged in an unwarranted \"'attack\" on\nthe court monitor, Dr. Daignault, F. 86, App. 1230, grossly mischaracterizes\nDMR's good faith attempts to learn the nature and extent of Dr. Daignault's\nrelationships with BRI's attorneys and their clients. In fact, the evidence\ndemonstrated that DMR had good reason for seeking this information--i.e.,\nto determine whether Dr. Daignault, the presumably \"independent\" court\nmonitor, in fact had financial ties to BRI's lawyers or their other clients that\nundermined either his impartiality or the appearance thereof. In response\nto DMR's initial inquiries on this subject, BRI's attorneys acknowledged that\nthey, as well as three or four wards, had hired Dr. Daignault as a forensic\nevaluator or expert witness in a number of matters. Ex. U-86. In addition,\nDMR learned that Dr. Daignault had filed affidavits on behalf of clients of\nBRI's law firm in other cases brought against DMR. Tr. IX:43-45; Ex. DMR-\n41. Without more information about this potentially conflicted relationship\n127No evidence established the content of such drafts or that any letters were actually\nsent in response tothe program. Although DMR's press office prepared for media inquiries\nby drafting an information sheet, Ex. BRI-263; Tr. IV:47-51, there was no evidence that this\ninformation sheet was anything other than an accurate synopsis of DMR's positions\nregarding both BRI and aversives.\n128Thetrial court's findings on this subject, F. 84-86, App. 1230, are adopted from BRI's\nproposed f'mdings 141-42, 144; App. 803-04,\n\n91\nbetween the court monitor and counsel for the opposing party, DMR could\nnot determine whether there existed any actual impropriety.\nDMR first sought further information on this subject from BRI's\nattorneys, who directed DMR to seek the information from Dr. Daignault\nhimself. Ex. U-86. DMR then sought this information from Dr. Daignault\ndirectly. Tr. IX:40--42; Ex. U-85. In response, Dr. Daignault refused to\nprovide the information and stated that the court had told him he need not do\nso, absent a court order. Tr. IX:41-42; Ex. DMR-39, 40. At that point, DMR\nfiled a \"Motion for Disclosure of Court Monitor's Work for and\nCompensation by Attorneys for the Plaintiffs.\" App. 185. DMR requested\na heating on this motion on a previously scheduled court date, but the court\ncontinued the hearing indefinitely pending the resolution of Dr. Daignault's\nrequest for court-appointed counsel. Ex. DMR-42.\nThe trial court's inference that DMWs _'August 19th\" request for this\ninformation was \"in response\" to BRI's first request for mediation with the\ncourt monitor is baseless. F. 84, App. 1230. The letter was in fact dated\nAugust 24, 1993. _2\"From its content, it is clear that this letter was prompted\nby a letter from BRI's attorney that was received by DMWs attorney that\nsame day, in which BRI's attorney suggested that DMR contact Dr. Daignault\nto seek the information, stating, \"Dr. Daignault's records would be more\naccurate and complete than my own with respect to the total fees paid to Dr.\nDaignault.\" Ex. U-85.\nThe trial court also erred in finding that, at the time that DMR sought this\ninformation from Dr. Daignault, DMR itself had also retained Dr. Daignault\nfor consultation on unrelated matters. F. 85, App. 1230. This finding (taken\nnearly verbatim from BRI's proposed finding 142, App. 803) is contrary to\nthe testimony of Dr. Daignault himself, who testified that since the inception\nI_Tne wrong date, \"August 19,\" appears inboth the court's finding, F. 84, App. 1230,\nand BRI's proposed finding 14t, App. 803, demonstrating that the trial court relied on BRI's\nproposed finding rather than on DMR's letter itself in making this finding.\n\n92\nof DMR, there has been no occasion on which DMR had paid for his services\nas a consultant. Tr. IX:56. .3°\nOn September 3 and October 12, 1993, BRI filed contempt complaints,\nApp. 19, 20, alleging, among other things, that DMR had violated Part B of\nthe Settlement Agreement by failing to submit various matters to Dr.\nDaignauh for arbitration. In response, DMR filed an answer, App. 259, and\nnoticed nine depositions, including that of Dr. Daignault. App. 20, Ex. U-\n11l. All of those depositions were cancelled a week later, by agreement of\ncounsel. U-115.\nAlthough Dr. Daignaalt apparently took DMR's information requests and\ndeposition notice as personal attacks, Tr. !!:172, there was no evidence that\nthese facially legitimate actions were intended to \"harass\" and \"intimidate\"\nDr. Daignault, as the court found. TM F. 86, 155-57; App. 1230, 1246. Those\nfindings should therefore be rejected as clearly erroneous. See Hartford\nAccident & Indemnity Co., 11 Mass. App. Ct. at I000 (one person's\nexpressions of belief without personal knowledge insufficient to show\nanother person's lack of good faith).\nI_:'rior toDr.Daignaulfstestimonyonthispoint, theCommissionermistakenly agreed,\ninrtsponse toleading questions by BRI, thatDMRhad paid Dr.Daignaultas aconsultant,\nTr.111:158-59.To relysolely onthe Commissioner's responsetoa leadingquestion inthe\nface ofDr. Daignaulfs owndenialof this fact,based onhis ownpersonal knowledge, was\nclearlyerroneous.\nt31TheCommissioner attempted to introduceallofthe otherdeposit/on notices served\nby DMR and by BRIat that same time, Ex. DMR-A, DMR-B, in orderto rebutthe false\nimpression created by the admission of Dr.Daignault'snotice alone and hisrelated direct\ntestimony. However, thosenotices wereexcluded as irrelevant. Tr.IX:28-29.\n\n93\n6. The Commissioner's Account of His 1991\nTelephone Conversation with Henry Clark\nWas Neither \"Blatantly False\" nor\nIntentionally UntruthfuL I32\nOn cross-examination by his counsel, the Commissioner testified as to a\ntelephone conversation he had had in 1991 with Henry Clark, an attorney\nwho was at that time an associate of Roderick MacLeish, BRI's lead counsel\nin this case. According to the Commissioner, Mr. Clark called him on the\neve of his assuming the position of Commissioner and conveyed a message,\npurportedly from Mr. MacLeish, \"wam[ing him].., not to do anything to\nBRI on Monday when [he] became Commissioner.\" Tr. VI:8. Mr. Clark's\ncomment was only one anecdote offered by the Commissioner as the basis\nfor his belief that BRI was inclined to be litigious and would therefore be\nlikely to contest any adverse regulatory actions. Tr. V!:7-8.

The court's findings on this subject begin with the suggestion that the\nletter was entirely unnecessary in light of Dr. Israel's letter of August 27,\n1993, _7 and accompanying \"significant documentation,\" which the court\nfound \"_ebutted most of the factual allegations\" contained in the\nI_The words used to characterize the Commissioner's testimony are significant because\nsuch findings of \"intentionally\" false testimony form the basis for the court's legal\nconclusions that the Commissioner (and Dr. Cerreto) committed perjury, App. 1231-34,\nwhich inturn, are relied upon as a basis for the extraordinary relief grained by the court. As\na legal matter, even if the Commissioner's testimony on this point were false, the precise\ncontent of his telephone conversation with Mr. Clark isfartoo removed from the legal issues\nin this case---whether the Commissioner violated an unequivocal provision of the settlement\nagreement--to be material, an essemial element of perjury.

Ex. DMR-17. The court\napparently based this finding on BR£s proposed finding 15I, App. 807, which contains the\nsame error.\n\n95\nCommissioner'Asugust6,1993letter.F.98,App. 1233. This finding has\nno basis ,xhatsoever in the evidence. BRI offered Dr. Israel's letter, Ex.\nDMR-I 7, not for the substance or truth of its contents, but only to show that\nDr. Israel gave a \"full and complete\" response to the requests for information\ncontained in the Commissioner's August 6 letter. _3s Tr. VIIA:36. The\naccompanying documentation was not offered into evidence by any party,\nand Dr. Israel's testimony concerning itwas limited to a description of its size\nand the _u'nount of work that it took to compile. Tr. VIIA:35-38. There was\nthus no evidentiary basis for the court to find that the accompanying\ndocumentation was \"significant\" or that it \"rebutted most of the\n[Commissioner's] factual allegations,\" F. 98, App. 1233, thereby making\nfurther inquiries unnecessary, t39 This is a particularly clear example of an\ninstance where \"[d]eference to a trial judge's findings reaches its limit,\" i.e.,\n\"when they are without basis in the record.\" Atkinson v. Rosenthal, 33 Mass.\nApp. Ct. at 223-24.\n_SDr. Israel's letter of August 28, 1993, was originally introduced by DMR, solely for\nthe purpose of showing that it was enclosed ina later letter sent by the Commissioner to\nBRI's out-of-state funding agencies. Tr. VI:14-15. On the other hand, the Commissioner's\nletter of August 3I, 1993, like all of his othercertification letters, was offered and admitted\nfor the truth of itscontents, as an uncontested exhibit. App. 415, 506; Tr. 11:134-35, 145.\n1_91nfact, rather than \"rebut\" the concerns expressed inthe Commissioner's August 6th\nletter, Dr. Israel's letter, which admired restra'ming students without court authorization and\nfailing toreport the use of restraints inaccordance with DMR regulations, Ex. DMR-17 at\n20-2 l, raised further concerns that were addressed by the imposition of further conditions.\nEx. U-91 at 2.\n\n96\nb. Misfirings of GED\nThe court next makes the general finding that \"[t]he August 31\nletter...contained false information concerning [BRI],\" F. 99, App. 1233; but\nthe only factual information identified as \"false\" is the statement that the\n\"field revie,,v has learned from a source 'other than JRC ''° that there were\nproblems with the misfirings of the GED device.\" F. 101-02, App. 1233-34.\nThe trial testimony and documentary evidence on this point, however, fully\nsupport the statement in the Commissioner's letter as to the source of the\ninformation on problems with GED misfires.\nAttorney Casey testified that he first learned of continued problems TM\nwith GED misfirings from reading a motion, contained in his file on BRI,\nwhich BILl had filed in Probate Court proceedings in November of 1992 in\nwhich DMR had not participated, t42 Tr. 1:188-90, Ex. U-74. Although\nAttorney Casey could not recall from whom he had received a copy of the\nmotion (i.e., from BRI or from some other source, Tr. 1:190), uncontroverted\ndocumentary evidence establishes that he received this motion, not from BRI\nas part of its application for re-certification, but from DMR's deputy general\ncounsel, who mailed him a copy of the motion on November 16, 1992. Ex.\nU-58 at 2. Thus, the statement in the letter is true and was amply supported\nby the evidence at trial. More significant (with respect to the\nCommissioner's good faith), the evidence shows that the Commissioner\nI'_Although this phrase appears inquotation marks inthe court's finding (and in BRI's\ncorresponding proposed finding no. 154,App. 8071, it isnot an accurate quotation from the\nCommissioner's letter, which states: \"Later, the field reviewers learned (not.from BR1) that\nthere were problems with misfirings of the GE;D device...\" (emphasis added). Ex-U9I at\nI. The court's verbatim adoption of BRI's \"quotation\" demonstrates, once again, that the\ncourt relied on BRI's proposed finding, rather than on the letter itself, inmaking this finding.\nz4z[n1991 Anomey Casey hadbeen told b) BRI staff thatprevious problems with GED\nmisfirings had been corrected. Tr. 1:189, n. 49_upra. See Statement of Facts, subsection\nA.I.\nz42See F. 102 n. 25, App. 1234 (tinding that DMR did not participate in the Probate\nCourt proceedings inwhich evidence of misftrings had been presented),\n\n97\nbelieved this statement to be true when he made it. On direct examination,\nthe Commissioner testified that his general counsel told him that DMR field\nstaff (including Attt_rney Casey) had first learned from a source other than\nBRI that the GED device was misfiring. Tr. 111:92-93. On cross-\nexamination, the Commissioner further testified that it was his understanding\nthat DMR staff had learned of the misfirings \"in reviewing records.\" Tr.\nV:76-77.\nHe specifically, explained what he meant when he used the parenthetical\n\"(not from BRI)\" in his letter of August 31, 1995: \"It was my understanding\nthat the team wer,t out and, in reviewing records, came to this understanding\nthat there had been mis-firings.\" Tr. V:77. And he also explained why the\nsource of the infbrmation was significant to him:\n[T]he de_ent is really in a role of monitoring, and to the greatest\ndegree, providers are required to be forthcoming with various\ninformation. It is their requirement to bring that to the attention of\nthe department .... The department does not have the ability to go\nout nod review and inspect all activities of all three or four hundred\nproviders across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nTr. V:77-78; see also Tr. V1:105-06; F. 101, App. 1233 (finding that the\nparenthetical, \"0_ot from BR1),\" \"was intended to imply that [BRI] was being\nless them forthcoming concerning the issue of misfires of the GED device\").\nTitus, the trial testimony of Attorney Casey and Commissioner Campbell\nfully supports the statement that the information concerning misfu'es was not\nprovided to the staffreview team by BRI but, rather, that DMR first learned\nthat there was a continuing problem with GED misfirings by reading a\nmotion filed by BRI in a court proceeding to which DMR was not a party.\nAs stated in the letter itself, it was that outside information that then led\nDMR to seek fiu'ther information on this subject directly from BILl. Ex. U-91\nat 1. There is therefore no basis in the evidence for the court's finding that\nthe statement contained in the Commissioner's letter of August 31,\n1993--that DMR field staff obtained this information from a source other\nthan BRl--is false. At the very least, the evidence demonstrates that the\nCommissioner had a good faith basis for making this statement.\nAccordingly, the court's finding that the statement was false should be set\n\n98\naside as clearly erroneous.\nc. Certification Conditions\nThe court then goes on to discuss five of the eleven conditions contained\nin the August 31 letter. 143First, the court finds that \"Condition 1 restricted\nJRC to the use of procedures which were actually in use as of August 27,\n1993.\" F. 104, App. 1234. That finding is contradicted by the letter itself.\nAs indicated in the letter, while the 25-day interim certification granted by\nthat letter applied only to the procedures then currently in use by BRI, the\nletter did not prohibit BRI from using other techniques. To the contrary, the\nletter stated: \"Should BRI believe that the use of any other technique is\nrequired, BRI will provide advance notice to DMR and meet with DMR\nregarding any such proposal.\" Ex. U-91 at 3. Given DMR's previously\nexpressed concerns as to the effectiveness and professional acceptability of\npainful procedures, Ex. u-g2 at 5, such as spanks, pinches and slaps, and the\nfact that BRI confu-med that itwas no longer using those procedures anyway,\nEx. U-91 at 3 n. 5; Tr. VIII:41, itwas not unreasonable for the Commissioner\nto require advance notice ifBRl chose to resume the use of such procedures.\nIn any event, Dr. Israel testified that since August 31, 1993, BR1 never\nproposed resuming the use of any of these procedures, Tr. VIII:41, so any\nburden imposed by this requirement was purely theoretical. 1.4\n_4_Tothe extent that thecourtwas, in effect, reviewing de nova the legal and factual\nbases forthe conditions imposed by the Commissioner, the court exceeded itsjurisdiction.\nBRI waived any right tojudicial review of the Commissioner's certification decisions by\nfailing toexhaust itsadministrative remedies and seek judicial review under G.L.c. 30A,\n§ 14, in a timely manner. Moreover, any such review would have to be the subject\nofanindependent chapter 30A action,with the applicable, limited scope ofjudicial review,\nrather than a component of acontempt proceeding ina ten.year-old \"settled\" case.\nl*Vl'becotm's statementsthat thiscondition violated the Settlement Agreement and the\nsubstituted judgment rulings ofthe Probate Court, F. 104-10, App. 1234-35, are incorrect\nasamatter oflaw forthe reasons discussed inArgument I.B,supra. Inaddition, as amatter\nof fact, itwas not BRI's practice to seek court approval when discontinuing a procedure\n(continued...)\n\n99\nSecondt,hecourtmentions(butfindsnoexpressfaultwith)the condition\nrequiring BRI to comply with all DMR regulations regarding the use of\nmechanical restraint. F. 106, App. 1234. The court's further statement that\n\"It]here was no evidence adduced in this case that [BRI] had utilized\nmechanical restraint\" in violation of DMR's regulations, F. 107, App. 1235,\nis false. _45The August 31, 1993, letter itself, an uncontested exhibit admitted\nfor the truth of its contents, sets forth, in full detail, the factual bases for\nDMR's conclusion that BRI had consistently and repeatedly violated DMR's\nmechanical restraint regulations. _46 Ex. 91 at 5-7. In addition, Dr. Israel\nadmitted such violations in his response to the Commissioner's August 6th\nletter. DMR-17 at 20-21. At the very least, this demonstrates a good faith\nbasis for this requirement, if any justification is needed for a requirement that\na licet_sed provider mechanically restrain its clients only in accordance with\nthe applicable state regulations, t47\nThe third condition mentioned by the trial court required BRI to\ncooperate with an independent performance and program review of BRI to\nI\"(...continued)\npreviously authorized bythe Probate Court in substituted judgment proceedings, Tr. VIII:4I,\nthus undermining BRI's argument that Probate Court authorization to use a procedure\nconstitutes an orderto continue doing so.\n14S'lhis statement isalso another example of the court's requiring the Commissioner to\nprove the good faith basis for his actions, rather than placing that burden on BRI, the party\nalleging that his lack of good faith constitutes contempt. See Argument I.E.2, supra.\n1(6For example, the letter states:\nOn August 16, 1993, aDMR licensor discovered inaBRI group\nhome the presence of a shower with a leather restraining cuff,\nand art apparent GED electrode. The licensor was told that,\nwhen aBRI client had a behavior problem inthe shower, he or\nshe was restrained and electric shock administered. A hose was\nfound attached to one home's shower. Tv,'o homes' showers had\nkeyrings attached.\nEx. U-91 at 6.\n14\"_Compliance with these regulations is also expressly required by the Settlement\nAgreement, Part D, ¶ 6, App. 12g.\n\n100\nbe arranged by DMR. F. 108, App. 1235; Ex. U-91 at 7. Although the court\nfound fault _sith the process by x_hich DMR selected the team to conduct this\nreview, see subsection 12, infra, the court found no fault with the condition\nitself. Nor _as there any evidentiary basis for doing so, given the\nCommissioner's legal authority and uncontradicted factual justification for\nconducting this review, as set forth in the letter itself. Ex. U-91 at 7.\nThe fourth condition alluded to by the trial court, Condition 10, required\nBR1 to inform out-of-state agencies that fund students at BILl of the\nrequirement that they have in place \"an emergency plan for each resident to\naddress the funding and logistics of an), unexpected medical, personal or\nprogrammatic situations which BILl deems are beyond the capacity of BRI\nto address. Such plans must provide evidence of the funder's ability to\nimmediately provide all needed services for such clients so as to ensure that\nthe client isnot substantially endangered.\" Ex. U-91 at 5. In that same letter,\nthe Commissioner explained the rationale for this requirement as follows:\nThere have been situations in which BILl has expressed\nconcern, as have parents of some BRI residents, that the\nhealth and program needs ofclients continue to be met under\nany circumstances. DMR shares this concern. Because many\nclients are not funded or placed by the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, it is appropriate for the placing agency to\naddress those situations in which BRI determines it is unable\nto meet a client's needs. _*s\nld. at 8. At trial, the Commissioner elaborated on this rationale, Tr. V:78-79,\nand also explained why such a requirement had not been imposed on other\nproviders: because BILl has an usually large number of out-of-state clients.\nYr. V:79-82.\nThe last sentence of finding 111, App. 1236--that \"{n]o funding agency\nwould ever place a client in a private program for services when that provider\nwas being compelled at the same time to develop plans for emergency\nplacements\" (emphasis added)---demonstrates that the court (and BRI, who\n14SOnesuch situation occurred in 1989, _hen BRIdischarged aNew Jersey student, and\nDMR was forced to provide services to the student on an emergency basis because New\nJersey had no continget_cy plan in place. Ex. DMR-18.\n\n101\nproposed this language, F. 164, App. 112) misunderstood the very nature of\nthe condition. As indicated in the language of the condition itself, the\ncondition did not in any way require the provider, BRI, to develop emergency\nplacements for its out-of-state clients; rather, it required BRI simply to notify\nout-of-state funding agencies of that requirement, as Commissioner Campbell\nalso testified at trial. Tr. V:82.\nIn any event, there was absolutely no basis for the court's finding that\n\"[n]o funding agency would ever place a client in a private program\" that was\nsubject to Condition 10. F.III, App. 1236. Although Dr. Daignault\nexpressed his concern that it would be difficult for agencies to make\nemergency plans for BRI students, Tr. 11:141, Dr. Israel himself could not\nrecall a single instance of an agency removing a client from BRI after\nreceiving notice of this condition, Tr. VIII:I00; and he admitted that New\nYork and other states continued to refer new clients after this condition was\nimposed) _9 Tr. VI11:75-86; see also Ex. DMR-49; Tr. XI: 109-111 (student\nfrom New York admitted in February 1994). In fact, as reported by BRI's\ncounsel, in four meetings where funding agencies were ultimately notified of\nthis requirement, representatives of the agencies stated \"that their state had\nemergency services for all of their clients and that an emergency plan should\nnot be an issue.\" Ex. DMR-34 at 3, 4. I_°\nThe Commissioner's testimony on this subject was internally consistent\nand also consistent with his letter of August 31, 1993. The court's disbelief\n.,fthe Commissioner's stated purpose for this condition was no basis, in itself,\nfor finding that the Commissioner had different, ulterior motives for\nimposing this condition, Atkinson, 33 Mass. App. Ct. at 223-24--i.e., \"to\n1*gThislatler testimony was contraryto the contempt complaint, which was verified by\nDr. Israel under oathand stated that \"referrals from New York hald] decreased tozero.\"\nApp. 31I.\n_S°Despitetheir knowledge of the agencies' actual responseto thisrequirement, BRI's\ncounsel proposed the finding, which the courtadopted almost verbatim, that \"[n]ofunding\nagency would everplace aclient in a private program forservices ,*'henthat provider was\nbeing compelled todevelop plans foremergency placements.\" BRIProp.

The Commissioner agreed to change that condition\non September 23, 1993, in response to a proposal made by BRI, Ex. U-99;\nand BRI unilaterally ceased complying with it several months later, even in\nits modified form. Tr. VIII: 100; Ex. DMR-34. Thus, the court's inference as\nto what effect this condition, in the form set forth in the August 31 letter,\nwould have had if it were in fact implemented was entirely speculative and\ndirectly contradicted by Dr. Israel's own testimony and his counsel's own\nstatements on this subject, discussed above. TM Ex. DMR-34 at 3.\nAlthough the court finds a sinister connection between a reference to\n\"receivership\" in a DMR workplan, Ex. BRI-293) s2and the motivations\nunderlying Condition 10, F. 112, App. 1236, the workplan's reference to\nreceivership provides no evidentiary support for the court's findings\nconcerning Condition 10. The workplan item provided, in pertinent part, as\nfollows:\nisiThe stipulated testimony of Richard Wolfe, aNew YorkStateofficial, establishes that\nNew York agencies had otherreasonsforremoving students fromBILland not making new\nreferrals, i.e.,New York's policies disfavoring out-of-state placements.

Ex. U-91 at 5.\nAs indicated in Condition 11 itself, the emergency that this condition was\nintended to address was one created by BRI itself, not by DMR. As the\nCommissioner testified at trial, the same was true of the possibility of seeking\na receiver: \"[l]t was a contingency plan in response to an action taken by\nBRI, not something initiated by DMR.\" Tr. XIII:75. See also Ex. BRI-293\nat 5 (also using the term \"contingency\" in this context).\nOn the last day of trial, when the Commissioner was asked for the very\nfirst time about the basis for Condition 11 and the reference to receivership\nthat appeared in Ex. BRI-293, he responded as foUows:\nIt had come to my attention that in the mid 1980's, in response\nto a licensing action taken by OFC, that did not require a\nresponse by BRI to withdraw people from all treatment, _53\n15Vl'heCommissioner's characterizationofOFC's order was correct.

There isno basis inthe record forthe court's finding to the contrary.\nF. 190, App. 1255.

XIII:63; see also Tr. X111:65 (responding consistently to a similar\nquestion).\nMoreover, there was no evidence that this workplan item was ever, in\nfact, implemented. In any event, even if DMR requested the Attorney\nGeneral to prepare a receivership petition to be used in case of an emergency,\nno such emergency ever materialized and no such petition was ever filed, m\nThus, the evidence in the record demonstrates that the Commissioner had\na good faith basis for imposing each of the five conditions in his August 31,\n1993, letter that are mentioned in the court's findings. The court's findings\nto the contrary have no basis in the evidence and therefore should be set aside\nas clearly erroneous.\nls3(...continued)\nconstitute evidence of the opposite proposition. Atkinson, 33 Mass.

The Commissioner Acted Responsibly in\nKeeping Out-of-State Agencies and Parents\nof BRl Students Apprised of the Certification\nProcess.' 5_\nThe court also made erroneous findings as to the Commissioner's\nmotivations for sending copies of his August 6 and 31 letters to out-of-state\nagencies that were funding students at BRI and to the parents of BILl\nstudents.\na. Communications with Funding Agencies\nAs the Commissioner stated in his cover letter to the out-of-state\nagencies, his purpose in sending them copies of these letters '*vas\"[t]o enable\n[these] agenc[ies] to better understand the current situation.\" Ex. U-105. To\nthat same end, he also enclosed a copy of Dr. Israel's 52-page response to the\nCommissioner's August 6 letter and to the letter from Dr. Jansen that ',,,'as\nenclosed in the Commissioner's August 6 letter. Ex. U-105, DMR-I 7. Since\nthese out-of-state agencies, like DMR itself, are also accountable to the\nparents of the BRI students funded by those agencies, _s6the Commissioner\nreassured the agencies that the parents had no reason to be alarmed by the\ncertification conditions, '_many of which [we]re for the purpose of obtaining\nmore accurate and complete information on BRI's program.\" Ex. U-105. He\n\"stressed... that the requirements [we]re not intended to imply that the\n15_he trial court's findings on this subject, F. 116-19, App. 1237-38, are adopted from\nBRI's proposed findings I'/4, I'/7-79, App. 817-19.\nIS6Out.of-state agencies could not necessarily rety on providers alone to supply the\nagencies with allnecessary information. Ex. U-148.\n\n106\nDepartment intends to take any action that would negatively affect the\ntreatment of any consumer. ''t57 Ex. U-105.\nThe court's finding that DMR \"rejected\" BILl's request for mediation on\nthis issue. F. 116, App. 1237, mischaracterizes the evidence on this point.\nAlthough there was no face-to-face mediation on this subject, Dr. Daignault\ndid attempt to mediate this dispute by telephone and fax on September 23,\n1993. Ex. BRI-250. When the Commissioner ultimately decided to send out\nhis September 24, 1993 letter, Ex. U-105, without further mediation, Dr.\nDaignault nevertheless \"thank{ed DMR's counsel] for [her] willingness to\nspeak vdth [him and the guardian ad litem].\" Ex. U-104 at 2. Dr. Daignault\nthen reported to the court that \"arbitration among the parties under the\nSettlement Agreement, Section B-2, has failed.\" Ex. BKI-250 at 2. Thus,\nalthough Dr. Daignault's efforts to resolve this dispute were unsuccessful, it\nis not accurate to suggest, as does the court's finding, that DMR refused even\nto discuss the issue.\nMoreover, as indicated by the exchange of correspondence between Dr.\nDaignault and DMR's counsel on this subject, it was not clear that even Dr.\nDaignault believed that arbitration or mediation of this issue was required\nunder the Settlement Agreement. See also Tr. IX:35-37. Although Dr.\nDaignault urged DMR not to send out the letter, he and the guardian ad litem\nacknowledged that \"the Commissioner certainly ha[d] the prerogative to do\nso.\" Ex. U-104. Therefore, even if the court's finding on this subject were\naccurate, that finding would not support a conclusion that failure to mediate\nthis issue constituted contempt of an unequivocal order. See Argument I.C,\nsupra.\nTen days later, on October 4, 1993, the Commissioner sent another letter\nto the out-of-state funding agencies enclosing a copy of his September 24,\n157TheCommissioner's trial testimony on this subject was consistent with these\nstatements. Tr. 111:129-30(Commissioner did not believe that funding agencies would be\nalarmed by receiving copies ofthes_ letters); Tr.lit: 152-53(Commissioner would notbe\nalarmed if he received notice that DMR would have to develop contingency plans for\nstudentsplacedout of state); Tr.VI:I3-16 (Commis'fioner sent funding agencies copies of\nDr. Israel's response toAugust 6letter).\n\n107\n1993,letter extendingBRI's certificationto December15, 1993.and\namendingCondition 10in the mannerproposedby BRI. Ex. U-107\n(enclosingEx.U-106). In thatletter,theCommissione\"rreiterateld]that\n[DMR] will takenoprecipitousactionthatcoulddisruptthetreatmenntow\nbeingprovided to the residents of BRI.\" Ex. U-107.\nIf any further reassurance to the funding agencies was needed, it was\nprovided by Dr. Israel, in his letters to them of September 23, 1993 (which\nhe sere in anticipation of the Commissioner's letter of September 24, 1993), _5_\nassuring them that BRI's \"program has never been stronger.\" Ex. DMR-33.\nStill more reassurance was provided in the Commissioner's subsequent letter,\nsent at the trial court's direction, in January 1994, specifically advising these\nagencies that the length of time DMR v,'as taking to consider BRI's\ncertification application \"should, in no way, adversely [a]ffect any decisions\nabout placement that you may be making.\" App. 216.\nThere was no evidence presented at trial to support the court's inference\nthat sending copies of the certification Fetters to funding agencies was done\n\"with the intent to interfere with [BRI]'s relationship with its funding\nagencies.\" F. I18, App. 1238. Nor, as discussed above, is there any evidence\nthat doing so had this effect.\nb. Communications with Parents\nBy letter dated September 3, 1993, the Commissioner wrote directly to\nthe parents of BRl students to assure them that the Department had not taken\nany actions that would result in the abrupt cessation of BRI's certification to\nuse Level 111aversives and that no such actions were contemplated. Ex. U-\n92. In that letter, the Commissioner enclosed copies of his August 6 and 31\nletters, Ex. U-92, which Dr. Israel apparently had already sent to the parents.\nEx. DMR-35. To further address any concerns the parents might have about\nBRI's certification, the Commissioner met personally with them in Waltham,\n158As a courtesy, the Commissioner had notified BRI, in advance, of his intention to\napprise the out-of-state agencies of the status of the certification process. Ex. U-102.\n\n108\nMassachusetts, and in New York City on September 29 and October 6, 1993.\nEx. U-109.\nThere is nothing in the Commissioner's letter or in his remarks to the\nparents from which the court could reasonably infer that these\nconmmnications were \"designed to alarm the parents [}and... to interfere\nwith [BRI]'s relationship with the families.\" F. 119, App. 1238-39. To the\ncontrmy, as the documents show, and as the Commissioner testified at trial,\nhis intent was both to inform the parents and to allay their anxieties. Tr.\nV:82-91, VI:21-23. To the extent that the Commissioner was the \"bearer of\nbad tidings\" (e.g., as to the large number of abuse complaints that had been\nfiled concerning BRI students), _59which understandably caused concern on\nthe pint of the parents, this was the unavoidable consequence of his efforts to\nkeep them informed, rather than evidence of the Commissioner's bad faith.\nThe court's inference to the contrary, akin to \"shooting the messenger,\" was\nentirely unfounded.\nOn the other hand, there is ample evidence in the record, which was\ndisregarded by the trial court, that the parents' anxieties were caused, not by\ncommunications from DMR, but by communications from BRI itself. In a\nseries of letters to bRl parents and \"friends,\" Dr. Israel characterized the\nConmlissioner's regulatory actions as \"ominous,\" \"bad faith\" \"attacks\" that\nshow that \"Commissioner Campbell's intent is to close BRI\" and \"put BRI\nout of business.\" Ex. DMR-35. These letters were obviously intended to\nalarm the parents in order to rally their support--\"to join hands and fight\nback,\" as Dr. Israel put it--in \"defeating the attempts of DMR to close BRI?'\nEx. DMR-35. Some parents apparently responded to BRI's battle cries by\nsending letters to the Commissioner accusing him of harrassing BRI or\nplanning to close BRI down. Ex. U-92, U-109; Tr. V:85-86. Rather than\n\"interfere with [BRI]'s relationship with the families,\" F. 119, App. 1238, the\n159AS the Commissioner attempted to show at trial, through the testimony of Richard\nCohen, DMR's Director of Investigations, none of those complaints had been filed by DMR\nemployees. However, that testimony was excluded, for no stated or apparent reason. Tr.\nXIIB:24-25, App. 633.\n\n109\nCommissioner's actions apparently further cemented at least some parents'\nloyalty to BRI.\n9. DMR's Report to the Court on the Status of\nBRI's Application for Certification Was\nNeither False nor Misleading. _\nAmong the principal bases of the court's conclusion that the\nCommissioner acted in bad faith are the findings that his general counsel\nfiled a report to the court in September 1993, App. 147, which did not fully\ndescribe, or include as exhibits, internal reports of DMR field staffthat had\nrecommended certifying BRI to use Level 111aversives with relatively\nminimal conditions. _6_On this basis, the court found this report to contain\n_'blatant false statements and material omissions.\" F. 120, App. 1239.\nAs explained by the Commissioner, in response to questions as to why he\ndid not send copies of his staffs recommendations to the parents of BRI\nstudents, it would have been misleading to publicize those internal\nrecommendations after the), had been rejected by the Commissioner. Tr.\nV:87-89. For the very same reasons, those internal recommendations, v_'hich\nhad been rejected by the Commissioner in July 1993, were immaterial to the\n\"current status of BRI with regard to compliance with state la_ and\nregulations,\" as of September 1993, which was the stated subject of the\nreport. App. 147. The official position of the Department as to BRI's\ncompliance with state law and regulations was fully set forth in the report and\nthe exhibits thereto. Previously rejected internal recommendations of lower\nlevel officials and consultants were not only immaterial but would have been\nmisleading to the court as to BRI's actual prospects for certification. See\nsubsection 2, supra.\n16°'l'he u,al court's findings on this subject, F. 120-25, App. 123%40, are adopted from\nBRI's proposed findings 180-93. App. 819-24.\n161Asto these certification team reports, see Statement of Facts. section A.I.\n\nI10\nBRI was aware, as early as May 1992, that the staff review team had\nrecommended certification of BRI. Ex. BRI-271, Tr. VIIB:TI. If BRI\nbelieved that DMR's report to the court did not sufficiently describe or\nemphasize those recommendation% it could have so advised the court at that\ntime, which it did not.\nMoreover, there is no indication in the court's findings or in the\nunderlying record that the court ever relied upon this report, prior to trial, for\nany purpose. Indeed, as found by 1he court, it was \"tmsolicited,\" F. 120, App.\n1239; and, as is apparent from the report itself, App. 147, it was not filed in\nsupport of or in opposition to any motion, and it sought no action from the\ncourt. Nor was this report relied upon by the Commissioner at trial. Rather,\nthe court took judicial notice of it at BRI's request. Tr. l:177.\nThe court's finding that the omission of rejected staffrecommendations\nfrom this report constituted amaterial omission intended to deceive the court\nis therefore clearly erroneous. To the extent that these \"findings\" and\naccusations are, instead, inferences or legal conclusions, they should be\nsununarily rejected by this Court based on its own review of the underlying\nevidence. Simon, 389 Mass. at 148-51.\n\n111\n10. The Commissioner Had a Good-Faith Basis\nfor Appointing Gunnar Dybwad to BRI's\nHuman Rights Committee and Did Not\nRefuse to Mediate This Issue.L62\nAs explained in the Commissioner's August 6 letter, his decision to\nappoint two people to BRI's thirteen-member Human Rights Committee, 163\nEx. DMR-47, was based on a review of the minutes of the committee's\nmeetings, which showed \"that there is little or no discussion, questioning, or\nanalysis of the treatments proposed for BRI clients, nor is there any\ndiscussion of the application of regulator)' and other rights protection issues\nin individual[s'] cases.\" Ex. U-82. The Commissioner's assessment was\ncorroborated by the testimony of Carol Upshur, one of the Commissioner's\nappointees to this committee, Tr. XI:96-97, and by the minutes of the\nmeetings she attended. Ex. DMR..47, DMR-50, DMR-52. The\nCommissioner testified that his reason for appointing Dr. Gunnar Dybwad to\nBRI's Human Rights Committee, knowing Dr. Dybwad's general opposition\nto aversive treatments, was \"to stimulate discussion, to provide the committee\nwith a range of ideas.\" Tr. V:72. _u While the court \"recognize[d] the value\nof members of the Human Rights Committee with differing positions,\" F.\n128, App. 1241, it nevertheless found that the Conunissioner's appointment\nof Dr. Dyb_ad was \"calculated... to disrupt the operalions of [BRI}.\" ld\nThere is no evidence fi'om which the court could infer such a motivation\non the part of the Commissioner. Indeed, the only evidence is to the contrary.\n_62Thetrial court'sfindings onthis issue, F. 126-29, App. 1240-41, are adopted from\nBRrs proposed findings 194-97, App. 825-26.\n163The Commissioner is authorized to make such appointments as a condition for\ncertification to use Level 111aversives \"in the event that he... determines that such\nappointment orappointments are necessary to ensure performance by [the] committee of\ntheir review responsibilities consistent with the requirements established by [DMg's\nbehaviormodification] regulations.\" 104C.M.R. §20.15(4X0(TXa).\n1_4Dr.Dybwad'sname isinaccurately transcribed as \"Duarte\" at Tr.V:72-73.\n\n112\nBoth the Commissioner and Dr. Upshur, his other appointee, testified that the\nCommissioner gave his appointees no particular instructions as to their role,\nother than that it should be the same as the other members of the committee.\nTr. VI:9, XI:81. Nor is there any evidence that Dr. Dybwad's presence on the\ncommittee, which lasted for only five or six months, during which he\nattended only one or two meetings, Tr. V:74, Ex. DMR-47, caused any\ndisruption whatsoever to BRI's program. While he and Dr. Upshur\napparently voted against the treatment plans proposed by BRI's staff, they\nwere always out-voted by the majority of the committee, Tr. XI:133, as the\nCommissioner anticipated when he appointed them. Tr. V:73.\nThe court's further findings, that BRI had proposed mediation on the\nsubject of Dr. Dybwad's appointment and that DMR had refused to mediate\nthis issue, F. 129, App. 1241, are also clearly erroneous. Contrary to these\nfindings, the only evidence on this subject shows that the parties discussed\nDr. Dybwad's appointment at a follow-up meeting to a mediation session on\nSeptember 27, 1993, but that BRI then proceeded to raise this issue in its\namended contempt complaint, filed on October 8, 1993, without first seeking\nmediation or arbitration. Ex. U-110, BRI-309.\n11. The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor the Statements Contained in His\nCertification Letter of September 24, 1993.165\nBy letter dated September 24, 1993, the Commissioner extended BRI's\ncertification until December 15, 1993, again with certain conditions. Ex. U-\n106. The court takes issue with only two points in that letter. First, the court\nfinds that the Commissioner's reference to the fact that 14 abuse\ninvestigations were then pending against BRI, including complaints against\nDr. Israel himself, was a departure from DMR's usual practice not to reveal\nallegations of abuse without first having them substantiated. This finding is\n16\"_Thetrial court's findings on this issue, F. 130-34, App. 1241-42, areadopted from\nBRI's proposed findings 198-205, App. 826-28.\n\n113\nclearly erroneous. The Commissioner himself testified that it was DMR's\npractice to release such information in response to a \"freedom of information\nact\" request. Tr. 111:188. When the Commissioner's counsel attempted to\nelicit further infomlation from DMR's Director of Investigations about\nDMR's usual practices with respect to abuse investigations, such testimony\nwas excluded as irrelevant, and the court repeatedly instructed the\nCommissioners counsel to limit her questions solely to DMR's investigations\nconcerning BRI students. Tr. XIIA:I41-43, 148, 149. See also Argument\nII.B, supra.\nIn any event, even if mentioning these abuse complaints were a departure\nfrom DMR's ordinary practice, such a departure would have been warranted\nin this context, as one area where further investigation was needed before a\nfinal decision could be made on BRI's certification. Ex. U-106 at 1. As\ntestified by the Director of Investigations, there were in fact 14 recently filed\nabuse complaints concerning BRI students pending at that time, which was\nan unusually large number of complaints against a single provider in such a\nshort time period. Tr. XIIB:23-24.\nThe only other problem that the court cites with respect to the September\n24 letter is the use of the plural word \"deaths\" in the condition requiring BRI\nto \"provide the Commissioner with all reports, if any, which should have\nbeen received pursuant to [DMR regulations] since 1989 .... The reports\nshall be provided by October 22, 1993, except that an), reports of deaths shall\nbe provided by October 5, 1993. '''_ Ex. U-106 at 4. According to the court,\nthe use of the plural word \"deaths\" was \"misleading and likely to produce the\ndamaging impression that deaths had been occurring at [BRI] and that [BR1]\nhad not been reporting them.\" F. 134, App. 1242. There is no evidence that\nanyone was actually misled by the wording of this condition; nor is there any\nevidence that it was intended to be misleading. To the contrary, both in the\ncondition itself and in the earlier explanation of why this condition was being\n166Assetforthinthe letter, theCommissioner had areasonable basisforimposing this\ncondition, i.e., Bgl's useof an\"incident\" form that does not contain all of the information\nrequiredbyDMRregulations. Ex. U-106at2;see also Ex.DMR-17 at20-2 I.\n\n114\nimposed, the letter repeatedly uses the words \"any\" or the phrase \"if any\" in\nconnection x_ith the reports, injuries, or deaths in question, thereby\nprecluding the inference that a particular number of deaths or injuries had\noccurred or gone unreported. Tr. U-106 at 2, 4.\n/2. DMR Conscientiously Exercised Its\nAuthority to Conduct an Independent\nReview of BRl 'sProgram. 167\nAs one of the conditions of BRPs interim certification, the Commissioner\nrequired that BRI submit to an independent program review. Ex. U-91 at\n4. s68 Over BRI's objections, DMR selected the Rivendell Team to perform\nthis review; and, in the spring of 1994, the Rivendell Team visited BRI,\nexamined records, and prepared a 134-page report on BRI's program. Ex.\nDMR-2.\na. The Decision to Require an\nIndependent Program Review\nIn its findings on this subject, the trial court first attacks the decision to\nconduct an independent review, by discrediting Assistant Commissioner\nCerreto's testimony that she had recommended the outside review because the\nstaff certification team's review was inadequate. _69 F. 136-37, App. 1242.\nApparently, the court based this finding solely on the fact that Dr. Cerreto\nhad not seen the written reports of the staffreview team, F. 137, App. 1242,\n167Thetrial court'sf'mdingsonthissubject, F. 136-52, 158-60, 162-66; App. 1242-45.\n1246.48, are adopted from BRI'sproposed findings 211,215, 218-22, 225-27, 229-39, 24I,\n243-45, 247-5 I;App. 831,833-34, 835-39, 840-44.\n16SAsset forthin the Conmissioner's letter,his authorityto requiresuch a review\nderives from 104C.M.R. §20.15(4Xf)(10).\n_69Asto the staff certifi,:ationteam's reportsandrecommendations, see Stazementof\nFacts,subsection A.12, andArgumentIII.B.2,supra.\n\n115\no.sDr. Cerreto testified. Tr. X:138-144. However, the trial court ignored the\nfurther, uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Cerreto---that she was informed of\nthe teams' methods, and, based on her experience as a clinical psychologist,\nthat she found those methods to be insufficient to review a program such as\nBl_d. Tr. X:43-44. In particular, Dr. Cerreto testified that she was aware that\nthe review teams \"had reviewed all 48 paper programs [i.e., behavior\nmodification treatment plans] but had reviewed implementation of only one\nstudent['s plan].\" In her professional opitiion, \"it no longer mattered what the\n[certification team's] report said because the method to collect the data wasn't\nveo\" good.\" Tr. X:145. The trial court did not find that Dr. Cerreto's opinion\non this issue was mistaken, and BRI presented no evidence of any sort, let\nalone an)' competing expert testimony, from which one could conclude that\nDr. Cerreto's assessment of the team's methods was unsound. Thus the\nfindings both ignored uncontroverted evidence, _7°and lacked any foundation\nin the record.\nb. Requests for Proposals\nTbe court's findings regarding the process by which DMR solicited\nproposals are equally erroneous. For example, while it is true that Dr.\nCerreto testified that she knew of no other examples of a request for\nproposals (\"RFP\") being issued with a ten-day response time, F. 140, App.\n1242, Dr. Cerreto's responses to the two previous questions established that\nshe was not aware of any similar RFPs being issued at all. Tr. X:149-50.\nThe trial court also found that the procedure used by DMR was inconsistent\nwith Commonwealth \"policy,\" F. 140, App. 1242, without any evidence of\nwhat Commonwealth policy was or how it would apply to the RFP issued by\nDMR. Tr. X:151.\n17°Thetrial court alsocompletely ignored uncontroverted testimony that DMR was\nmotivated, in part, by a concernthat BRI would challenge as biased any in-depth review\nperfo.\"medby DMR itself. Tr.X:44.\n\n116\nWithnosupportinthe record, the court found that the reason why only\ntwo proposals were received in response to the RFP was the ten-day turn-\nmound time. F. 142, App. 1243. Absent a factual basis, this finding is clearly\nerroneous. The court also erred in finding that Dr. Cerreto failed to extend\nthe deadline in response to complaints about insufficient turn-around time.\nF. 141, App. 1243. There was no testimony indicating that Dr. Cerreto\nreceived comments prior to the close of the response time, or even prior to\nthe selection of a consultant. Tr. X:158-59.\nc. Rivendell's Proposal\nThe trial court's findings regarding the Rivendell proposal itself appear\nto be based solely on mischar_cterizations of Dr. Cerreto's testimony drawn\nfrom BRI's proposed findings of fact. Dr. Cerreto testified that the initial\nRivendell proposal identified the personnel on its team by means of short lists\nof names from which the team would be drawn. The proposal stated that the\nfinal selection of team members would be dependent upon the dates on which\nthe visit was to occur. DMR selected RivendeU based on that initial proposal.\nTr. XI:51-52, Ex. BRI-310. In October of 1993, Rivendell submitted a\nrevised version of its proposal, which narrowed the choices of team members\ndown to approximately two per category. This iteration also proposed\nalternative dates for the site visit. Tr. X1:52-54; Ex. BRI-308. Still another\nversion of the proposal was necessary to finalize the actual team membership.\nTr. XI:53.\nThe trial court's findings regarding the proposal finalization abound with\nmischaracterizations. First, the court faults Dr. Cerreto for testifying\nuntruthfully about this issue. F. 145 n. 31,146, App. 1244, In fact, when\ngiven the opportunity, Dr. Cerreto explained the process fully. Tr. XI:51-53.\nDuring cross-examination of Dr. Cerreto, BRI attempted to suggest that\nsubmitting a revised version of the proposal constituted \"altering\" the\nproposal in some improper manner. Dr. Cerreto first rejected BRI's attempts\nto establish the dates ofx _ious documents basgd solely on the dates that the\ndocuments appeared to have been faxed. Rather than agree to the dates\n\n117\nsuggestedby BRI,sheconsistentlymaintainedthatshecouldnottell ifa\ngivenexhibitwastheinitial Rivendell response without comparing it to tile\ncop)' in her off'ice. Tr. X:164-65, 179. She then tried to clarify her testimony\non this point, only to be cut off, three times by BRI and once by the court.\nTr. X:179-81,185.\nThe trial court also unreasonably imputed a bad faith motive for DMR's\nsimply providing BRI with the then-current version of the Rivendell proposal\nin response to BRI's request for a cop)' of the RFP and Rivendell's proposal.\nF. 144-46, App. 1244; Ex. BRI-308. This inference, as well, is clearly\nerroneous.\nd. Selection of Rivendell\nThe trial court found (using the exact language proposed in E;RI's\nproposed finding 238, App, 839) that the presence of one individual Dr.\nRichard Amado, on the six-person team rendered Rivendell \"incapable 9f\ndoing a fair, impartial and unbiased review\" of BRI. F. 151, App. 1245.\nThere is no basis in the record for this finding. The only testimony regarding\nDr. Amado's ability to conduct an unbiased review came from Dr. Cerreto\nherself, TM who testified that, in conducting her analysis, she considered,\namong other factors, the fact that Dr. Amado had been a consultant for the\nUnited States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). As a DOJ consultant herselt,\nDr. Cerreto knew the rigor and objectivity one has to apply in such a\ncapacity; and DOJ had given Dr. Amado a favorable recommendation. Tr.\nX:54-55; X1:46. Findings of bias on the part of Dr. Amado lacked any\nevidentiary support. In selecting Rivendell's proposal, DMR had relied on\nthe fact that Dr. Amado himself, like all members of the Rivendell team, had\nused both aversive and non-aversive procedures and recognized the need for\naversive measures in appropriate situations. Ex. U-147 at 2. The trial court\n17tThecourt found Dr. Cerreto's testimony onDr. Amado's impartiality tobe incredible,\nF.I51-52, App. 1245,adopling the language verbatim fromBRI'sproposed findings 238-39,\nApp. 839-40; but thatcredibility finding does not establish theoppositeproposition, i.e.,that\nDr. Amado was biased against BRI.\n\n118\nignoredthisevidencealongwithevidencethat,in early1994,Dr.Amado\nhimselfwasoverseeingtheuseof electricshockin thecontrolof self-\ninjuriousbehavior.Id. at 5. Surely, Dr. Amado's public opposition to the\nincompetent and abusive use of aversive treatment, id at 5, and the\nappearance of his name on a list of \"supporters\" of an article opposing\npainful aversives, Ex. U-72, the only evidence of\"bias\" relied upon by BRI,\nis not sufficient, in itself, to support the court's characterization of DMR's\nselection of Rivendell as \"an example of bad faith.\" F. 163, App. 1248.\nNor is there any evidence to support the court's further finding that\nDMR's selection of Rivendell was motivated, not by the factors testified to\nby Dr. Cerreto, but, instead, by \"DMR's plan to get a biased view of BRI in\ntime for the December 15 deadline, which is the date DMR planned to de-\ncertify BRI. ''_72 F. 166, App. 1248. The court makes no findings that the\nreport actually produced by Rivendell was, in fact, biased, although that\nreport was in evidence. Ex. DMR-2. Nor is there any evidence that the\nCommissioner ever relied on the Rivendell report in taking any adverse\naction against BR1. In fact, rather than de-certify BRI on December 15,\n1993, the date cited by the court, the Commissioner's letter of that date\nextended BRI's certification for an additional 60 days. Ex. U-128.\ne. Dr. Cerreto's Role\nThe court's finding that Dr. Cerreto testified inconsistently as to her role\nin considering BRI's claims that the Rivendell team was biased, F. 162, App.\n1247-48, is a particularly striking example of the pattern discussed at the\noutset of_s argument, i.e., inferring that a witness intentionally lied, F. 168,\nApp. 1249, based solely on purported \"inconsistencies\" between a witness's\ntestimony and mischaractedzations of that witness's earlier testimony.\nDespite the court's finding to the contrary, F. 162, App. 1247, Dr. Cerreto\ntT_Again, the court's disbelief of Dr. Cerreto's testimony is not sufficient to prove this\nother, ulterior motive for the selection of Rivendell. dtkimon, 33 Mass. App. Ct. at 224.\n\n119\nnever testified that she was \"the [only] person from the Department who\nconducted the review of the Rivendell 'bias' issue. ''173\nOn direct examination, Dr. Cerreto testified that both she and Jean Tuller,\nthe Commissioner's special assistant, had a role in analyzing BRI's\nallegations. Tr. X:53, 55. That testimony was consistent ,_ith her deposition\ntesimony, that she \"read BRI's responses and responded to Jean [Tuller],\" she\n\"commented to Jean.\" Tr. XI: 19-24.\nOn cross-exanlination, BRI's counsel, relying on his personal notes of Dr.\nCerreto's direct examination, which mischaracterized Dr. Cerreto's earlier\ntestimony, TM and on selected excerpts from her deposition, tTsattempted to\nestablish an inconsistency between Dr. Cerreto's direct and deposition\ntestimony. Although Dr. Cerreto successfully resisted BRI's efforts to\nmischaracterize her previous testimony, TM the court nevertheless adopted\n173La.'lguageindicating that Dr. Cerretowas \"the person\" from DMR to conductthe\nreview appears only inBRI's(objected to)questions, Tr. X1:19-24; BRI's proposed finding\n245, App. 841;andthe court's finding, F.162,App. 1247;never inDr. Cerreto's own words.\nt74When theCommissioner objectedtoBRI'suseofcounsel's(inaccurate) notes forthis\npurpose, the courtoverruledthe objection on the groundthat \"this iscross-examination.\"\nTr.

Nor could this finding of untruthfulness, even ifitwereacorrect\ncharacterization ofthe testimony, supportaprosecution for perjury, since the subject of the\ntestimony--i.e., Dr. Cerreto's role inreviewing claims that Dr. Amado wasbiased against\nBRl--is entirely immaterial to the legal issues in this contempt case--i.e., whether the\nCommissioner directly violated any unequivocal provision of the Senlement Agreement.\nG L.c.268, § I (willfulness and materiality are essential elements ofthecrime of perjury);\nCommonwealth v.Geromini, 357 Mass. 61,63, 64(1970).\n\n121\n13. Neither the Commissioner nor His Attorneys\nImproperly Attempted to Conceal the\nSubjects Discussed at DMR Staff Meetings\non BR1.17s\nAs discussed in the Statement of Facts, section A.2, the Commissioner\nestablished large and small working groups to assist him in considering BRI's\napplication for re-certification. These groups regularly met on Tuesday\nmornings.\na. Commissioner's Testimony\nContrar?,, to the court's findings, Commissioner Campbell never testified\nat his deposition or at trial that \"the Tuesday Morning meetings related\nexclusively to the issue of certification.\" F. 170, 176; App. 1249, 1251.\nSince the pertinent portions of the deposition transcript were not offered or\nadmitted into evidence at trial or even read into the record for impeachment\npurposes, there was no basis whatsoever for the court's findings as to how the\nCommissioner testified at his deposition. _r9 F. 170, 176; App. 1249, 1251.\nThe only possible basis for this finding is BRI's mischaracterization of the\nCommissioner's deposition testimony, both during the Hal, Tr. 111:216, and\nin BRI's proposed finding no. 255. App. 845.\nAt trial, on direct examination by counsel for BRI, the Commissioner\ninitially responded affirmatively to general, leading questions as to whether\nthe BR1 meetings \"dealt strictly with the issue of BRI's application for\n17_.lhetrial court's finding.,o,nthissubject, F. 169-209,App. 1249-62, areadoptedfrom\nBRI's proposed findings253-314, App. 849-75.\n179Forthis Court'sintbrmation, the Commissioner's pertinent deposition testimony was\nasfollows: When hewasasked\"why\"(emphasis added) heorganized the BRI meetings, he\nresponded, \"To gather information aboutthe certification application.\" When asked, \"Did\nyou have any other reasonforforrmng the BKImeetings?\" (emphasis added), heresponded,\n\"No.\" Depo. Tr. 1:67.\n\n122\ncertification,\"Tr.111:72a,nd\"onlyconcernedcertificationapplications.\"Tr.\n111:214s7° However,whenhisattentionwasdrawntocertainitemsonthe\nagendasw,orkplanso, rnotesofthesemeetings,hereadilyagreedthatthose\nitemsdidnot relate to certification. Tr. 11I:216, 221,222, 223, 233, 235, 262;\nIV:43, 61,127. On cross-examination by his own counsel, the Commissioner\nagain confirmed that \"a number of matters that were on the agendas of the\nwork plans and that were discussed at the meetings had nothing to do with\ncertification\" but \"that the focus of the discussions at those meetings was\nprintarily on the subject of certification.\" Tr. V:104-05. As to why items that\ndid not relate to certification ',','ere discussed at these meetings, the\nCommissioner explained as follows:\nIf items beyond the focus of certification came up, there was\na time that all of the principal people of the department who\n',','ere involved in one aspect or another of BRI and the\ndepartment were already called together in one place, so it\nwas efficient to use the time for that ....\nTr. V:105-06.\nThus the Commissioner's trial testimony about the subjects actually\ndiscussed at these meetings was fully consistent with his deposition\ntestimony about his purpose for organizing these meetings. At trial, he\nreadily qualified his initial response to general leading questions by agreeing\nthat certain particular items brought to his attention by BRI's counsel did not\nrelate strictly to certification. The court's findings that the Commissioner\n\"knowingly and willfully\" \"testified falsely under oath\" on this subject are\ntherefore entirely unfounded. TM\nI_q'heCommissioner's initial agreement with this overgeneralization isnot surprising,\ngiven the factthat hehad spent only a few minutes prior to trial inreviewing some but not\nallof the many agendas for these meetings. Tr.V:I04.\nmCertainly, the Commissioner's testimony onthis subjectcannot be characterized as\n\"perju_',\" cf. App. 1308-09 (concluding that the Commissioner's testimony onthis subject\n\"would support a prosecution forperjury), since any initial misstatements as tothe subjects\ndiscussed atthese meetings ,,,,'erenot\"willful,\" Nolan and Henry, 32 Mass. Practice §611\n(no perjury ina witness's makingand correcting an innocent mistake); and what items were\ndiscussed in DMRstaffmeetings isentirely immaterial tothe legal issuebefore the courtin\n(continued...)\n\n123\nb. Assistant Commissioner's Testimony\nThe court's finding that Dr. Cerreto's deposition testimony \"echoed\" the\nCommissioner's testimony that \"the purpose of the Tuesday morning\nmeetings was 'strictly to determine . . . whether BRI's use of Level 111\naversives complied with Departmental regulations,'\" F. 170 n. 34, App. 1249,\nis both identical to BRI's proposed finding 256 n. 21, App. 845, and clearly\nerroneous. To make this finding, the court adopted BRI's skewed description\nof Dr. Cerreto's deposition testimony, id., and ignored Dr. Cerreto's trial\ntestimony on this very issue. Tr. X:I09-10.\nIn her deposition, Dr. Cerreto testified that the group's \"charge\" was to\n\"address the question of whether BRI['s] use of Level II1 behavioral\ninterventions was in compliance vdth DMR regulations.\" Tr. X:113. In\norder to clarify that philosophical and moral concerns were not part of the\ngroup's charge, Dr. Cerreto responded \"yes\" to the follow-up question,\nwhether \"[i]t [i.e., the group's charge] was strictly to determine.., whether\nBRI's use of Level III interventions complied with the departmental\nregulations.\" ld. (emphasis added).\nAt trial, Dr. Cerreto attempted to correct the misinterpretation of her\ndeposition testimony offered by BRI's counsel, id.; and she herself offered \"at\nleast two\" examples of topics discussed at the meetings which did not relate\nto BRI's certification. Tr. X:I09-110) 82Dr. Cerreto's trial testimony, readily\n_acknowledging the discussion of issues unrelated to BILl's certification was\nigtored by the court in concluding that she \"lied\" on this subject.\nltl(...continued)\nthiscase--whether the Commissioner violated any clear and unequivocal provision ofthe\nSe_:i'.ment Agreement.\n_S2BRI'_anempts to force Dr. Cerreto, later in the tri_,l,to accept an inaccurate\nrestatement ofthlstes_tmonyledthe court tocallarecess and instructDr.Cerreto toconfer\nwithcounsel abo,,: the necessity of telling the truth. Tr.X:123. After the recess, DMR\nattempted to correct the misimpression created by BRI's questions on this subject, by\nrequestingthat the court reporterreadtherelevant portion of Dr.Cerreto's priortestimony\nintothe record. BRIobjectedtothisrequest, and itwas deniedbythe court. Tr.X:I24.\n\n124\nc. Attorney-Client Privilege\nEqually unfounded are the court's findings that the Commissioner\n\"attempt[ed] to conceal [the subjects of these meetings] from the Court.\" F.\n177, App. 1251. Because the court's findings on this subject form the basis\nfor its conclusions of perjury, government malfeasance, and attorney\nmisconduct) s_App. 1308-10, the), require a particularly detailed discussion.\nAs found by the court, the agendas and minutes of tbese meetings were\nproduced by DMR in discovery) 84 F. 169, App. 1249. Although, when\noriginally produced, these documents contained redactions, BRI did not move\nto compel unredacted copies. Rather, counsel for BRI and DMR agreed prior\nto trial that the redacted documents could be marked as \"uncontested\"\nexhibits; and they were offered, as such, by BRI, at the outset of the trial. Tr.\n1:93-94; Ex. U-190-216.\n183Because, as the court implicitly acknowledged, its \"Corollary Findings of Improper\nConduct by DMR and ItsAttorneys\" are immaterial to the contempt judgment' App. 12_7,\nthose findings are not discussed in this brief, except, as here, where they overlap with the\ncourt's contempt f'mdings. Itshould be noted, however, that, like the contempt fmdings, the\ncorollary findings are adopted almost verbatim from BRI's findings on this subject, App.\n904-23, and are equally unsupported by the evidence.\nTo take just one particularly cleat example, although BRI proposed and the court found\nthat \"DMR listed more than 140 individual witnesses in itspr¢-trial memorandum,\" App.\n1292, infact, DMR listed 128witnesses, many of whom were also included in BRrs list of\nwimesses. App. 445. The cotnfs further inference, that \"listing... such a large number of\nwitnesses was a purposeful attempt to cause the plaintiffs to incur unnecessary legal\nexpenses,\" App. 1292 (adopted from BRI's proposed finding 412, App. 914), is directly\ncontradicted by the fee affidavits of BRl's counsel, which show that they spent no time\npreparing to examine any witness not ultimately called by the Commissioner or another\npart)', except Kim Murdock, App. 1188, who was also on BRI's llst, App. 433, but was not\ncalled by BKI either.\n_S4Although the court found that the documents were produced \"on the eve of trial,\"\nthere isno support for this finding in the record, other than the unsworn statement of BRrs\ncounsel tothat effect atuial. Tr. 111:229-30. In fact, although there is nothing in the court\nrecord to document this (because responses to document requests are not filed in court),\nDMR responded to BRI's document requests by making documents, including the agendas\nand minutes of these meetings, available for BRI to inspect and copy on May 30, 1995,\nalmost a month prior to trial.\n\n125\nDuring the first week of the trial, Bill's counsel informally asked DMR's\ncounsel to provide unredacted copies of these documents. After reviewing\nthe unredacted documents, DMR's counsel decided to release to BRI some\nredacted material as to which DMR had originally claimed attorney-client\nprivilege. However, BRI did not offer those additional documents into\nevidence at that time. Tr. 111:230.\nIn the afternoon of June 28, 1995, BRI's counsel began to question\nConmfissioner Campbell about the meeting agendas. During the course of\nthat examination, BRI's counsel asked the court to order DMR to produce\nunredacted copies of all of these documents to BRI or for in camera review\nby the court. Tr. II1:230. In response to that request, the Commissioner's\ncounsel stated, \"[WJe are trying to go through them and see which ones [i.e.,\nwhich claims of privilege] we would really want to press or not.\" The court\nthen directed, \"Don't redact them. They can be taken up in camera before the\njudge.\" Tr. 111:231. The Commissioner's counsel agreed to produce them for\nthat purpose the next morning. Id\nWhen court was called into session the next morning, June 29, 1995,\nBRI's counsel, Mr. Flammia, reported that DMR had produced additional\nunredacted documents to BRI that morning but that he had not yet had an\nopportunity to review them. He therefore asked \"if [he] could just have some\nmore time this morning to look at these notes and, if we need, to raise that\nmatter with [the court].\" Tr. IV:4. The court then asked the Commissioner's\ncounsel whether she \"agree[d] as to the material Attorney Flammia wishes\nto review during the day,\" Tr. IV:4-5; and counsel responded, \"Yes.\" At the\nend of the court day on Jane 29, 1995, BRI's counsel again stated that BRI\nhad received the additional documents but needed more time to review them.\nTr. 1V:241. After reviewing those documents, BRrs counsel did not seek in\ncamera review of the few items that remained redacted.\nTwo weeks later, on July 11, 1995, in response to the Commissioner's\ncounsel's offer to produce all remaining redacted material for in camera\ninspection by the court, Tr. X:68, BRI's counsel expressly disavowed an)'\ninterest in seeing any material as to which DMR continued to claim atlomey-\nclient privilege: \"Your Honor, we don't plan to hold up this trial for anything\n\n126\nthat they still maintain is privileged.\" Tr. X:69-70. However, in response to\narequest from one of the attorneys for the students, the court did examine the\nSeptember 7, 1993, workplan and the other redacted documents in camera,\n\"disallowed\" all of the redactions, and provided copies of the unredacted\ndocuments to all counsel. Is5 Tr. X:76-78; Ex. BRI-293 - BRI-304.\nDuring the lunch hour on July 11, 1995, BRI's counsel identified a few\nadditional documents of which DMR had not yet produced unredacted\ncopies. DMR agreed to search for them and produce them by 4 p.m. that day,\nand BRI's counsel stated that that would be \"fine.\" Tr. X:93; Ex. BRI-321.\nOn July 12, 1995, four other unredacted documents were produced, which\nwere substantially identical to the unredacted documents previously\nproduced. Ex. BRI-322. They contained no additional material as to which\na privilege had been claimed.\nIn its post-trial findings and conclusions, the trial court rejected the\nCommissioner's claim of attorney-client privilege as to the two remaining\nitems on which the privilege was claimed. App. 1250, 1308. Is6 That ruling\nwas incorrect as a matter of law.\nAs recognized by the court, App. 1305, the Commissioner ultimately\nasserted the attorney-client privilege only with respect to portions of two\ndocuments, Ex. BRI-293 mad BR1-294, which are workplans dated September\n_SSDespitethe court'sdissemination of the unredacteddocuments anditsstatement that\nthey wereadmitled intoevidence, the courtdeclined the Coramissioner's request fora ruling\nasto whether the redacted i.'emswereprivileged. Tr.X:76-78.\ntsrThetrial court'sfinding onthis subject, F. 173, App. 1350, isadopted from BRI's\nproposedfinding 259, App. 847. Thecourt's conclusions onthissubject, App.|305-08, are\nadopted from BRI'sproposed conclusions. App. 1036-40.\n\n127\n7 and 13, 1993. The two items for which the privilege was claimed\nconcerned: (1) the applicabiliq,' of certain conflict of interest provisions to the\ncourt monitor, Dr. Daignault, _s7 see subsection 5, supra; and (2) the\npreparation of a receivership petition for use if an emergency relating to BRI\narose) u See subsection 7, supra.\nThe court stated two rationales for rejecting the Commissioner's claim of\nprivilege vdth respect to these items. First, the court ruled the privilege\ninapplicable because the attorneys present at the meetings at which these\nitems were discussed were acting as regulators rather than attorneys. App.\n1306-08. This rationale is both factually and legally incorrect. The fact that\nthe purpose of these meetings was to determine whether BILl should continue\nto be certified to use Level Ill aversives and, if so, with what\nconditions--does not mean that legal advice did not play a role in making\nthat policy decision or that other legal issues did not arise in the course of\nthose meetings. To the contrary, since the certification decision turned on\ncompliance with the Department's regulations and other applicable legal\nrequirements, legal advice was an essential component of that determination.\nThe fact that information was provided by non-la_Ters, but for the purpose\nof obtaining legal advice, renders the privilege applicable, not inapplicable.\nSee Panell v. Rosa, 228 Mass. 594 (1918); Foster _:Hall, 29 Mass. (l 2 Pick.)\n89 (1831). The attorney-client privilege applies in full force where, as here,\nlg7\nPrelim. determined \"state employee\" Psychology Code of Ethics (Mary)\nunderc.258 (MariaM.providing Works under DMH contlact\nconfirming data oa hilling) APA ethicsboard\nDaignault reslx,nse was todirect\nDMR tofile raotionwiththecourt\nPlans developed\nAG should preparereceivershippetition ineaseof emergency.\nKim should includeinletter to BRIthatDMR would need 60 daysadvance\nnotice before BRIcloses.\n\n128\na government agency is acting in the role of client and agency counsel are\nacting as attorneys, Mead Data Central, Inc. v. United States Dep't of the Air\nForce, 566 F.2d 242,252 (D.C. Cir. 1977), particularly where the attorney-\nclient communication relates to ongoing or anticipated decisionmaking.\nBabets v. Secrelary of Human Services, 403 Mass. 230, 237 n. g 0988).\nThe item concerning conflict of interest clearly indicates that the\nConunissioner and his non-legal management staffsought legal advice from\nthe agency's general counsel. Upjohn Co. v United States, 449 U.S. 383, 390\n(1981) (privilege protects \"not only the giving of professional advice to those\nwho can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable\nhim to give sound and informed advice\"). The task was assigned to \"Kim\n[Murdock],\" DMR's General Counsel; *s9and the document apparently reports\nher \"prelimin[ary] determin[ation] [that Dr. Daignault is a] 'state employee'\nunder [G.L.] C. 258.\" See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Diamond, 773 F. Supp.\n597, 601 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (reports of attorney-client communications\nprivileged). Likewise, discussions between agency officials and agency\nlawwers c. ncerning referral of a potential receivership case to the Attorney\nGeneral, who serves as DMR's litigation counsel, constitute the seeking of\nlegal advice by a client agency from its attorneys. /d. at 601 (entry regarding\nreferral of legal matters to outside counsel privileged).\nAlternatively, the court held the privilege to be inapplicable because, in\nthe court's view, the redacted items showed that the testimony of DMR\nofficials concerning the subject matter of the meetings in question was\nmaterially and intentionally false. App. 1308-09. This rationale has no basis\nin law or fact.\nAs described by the United States Supreme Court, the purpose of the\nprivilege is \"to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys\nand their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the\nobservance of law and administration of justice.\" Upjohn Co. v. United\nJ89Thereisnobasis forthecourt'smistaken premise thatthis task was \"assigned to a\nnon-lawyer, Dr.Mar),Certeto.\" App. 1307. As clearly indicatedon the document itself,\nundertheheading \"Who IsResponsible,\" this taskwas assigned to\"Kim.\" Ex.BRI-293.\n\n129\nStates, 449 U.S. at 389. Since the very purpose of the privilege is to permit\nattorney-client communications to remain confidential, the fact that the\nprivilege, where applicable, shields information from the public, App. 1308,\ncannot in itself, constitute grounds for holding the privilege inapplicable.\nThe cases cited by BR1, and adopted by the court, purportedly in support\nof this rationale, in fact have nothing whatsoever to do with this entire issue.\nRather, the cited cases and the quotation therefrom, purportedly supporting\nthe proposition that the attorney-client \"privilege is routinely denied 'where\nthe docmnents sought may shed light on alleged government malfeasance,'\"\nactually pertain not to the attorney-client privilege, but to the \"deliberative\nprocess\" or \"official information\" privilege, Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v.\nDepartment of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d, 867, 885 (lst Cir. 1995); In re\nFranklin National Bank Securities Lit., 478 F. Supp. 577, 577 (E.D.N.Y.\n1979), a much more limited privilege that is not even recognized under\nMassachusetts law, see Babets, 403 Mass. at 232-39, and was not claimed\nhere.\nFurthermore, the information withheld here--that legal advice was sought\nor rendered concerning a potential receivership petition and a potential\nconflict of interest--is hardly the kind of \"government malfeasance\" that\nwould warrant exempting this material from an otherwise applicable\nprivilege. Therefore, even if there were a recognized exception to the\nattorney-client privilege in such circumstances, such an exception would not\nbe applicable here.\nAt the very least, the Commissioner had a good faith basis for asserting\nthe privilege here. The court therefore erred in admitting this material into\nevidence and, afortiori, in equating this legitimate claim of privilege with a\n\"fraud upon the Court.\" App. 1308. What should have been, at most, an\nevidentiary dispute as to whether the two items as to which the\nCommissioner claimed attorney-client privilege were admissible was blown\nout of all proportion by BRI in its proposed findings on this subject, which\n\n130\nwereadoptedalmostverbatimby the court. The court's findings that the\nCommissioner improperly \"attempt[ed] to conceal\" the subjects of the staff\nmeetings, F. 177, App. 1251, are clearly erroneous, as are the court's\ncorresponding \"corollary findings\" of attorney misconduct. App. 1287-93.\n14. The Commissioner llad a Good Faith Basis\nfor the Statements Contained in His\nCertification Letter of December 15, 1993.19o\nBy letter dated December 15, 1993, the Commissioner again extended\nBRI's certification to use Level 111aversives. Ex. U-128. In this letter, the\nCommissioner stated that BRI had failed to report a death of a student\ndirectly to the Commissioner's office. The letter went on to describe how the\nreport was made by BRl--i.e., by telephone to a field office rather than in\nv,xiting to the Commissioner's office, as required by DMR regulations. These\nfacts are not disputed by BRI. Ex. U-146. The court's characterization of the\nDecember 15 letter as \"falsely accus[ing BRI] of not reporting a death,\" F.\n210, App. 1263, is therefore erroneous in two respects: First, the letter did\nnot accuse BRI of failing to report a death; rather, it stated that BRI failed to\nmake the report in writing to the Commissioner's office, tg_ Second, the fact\nthat BRI failed to make the report in writing to the Commissioner's office is\nundisputedly true, not \"false.\"\nTwo semantic faults the court found with the December 15 letter were the\nstatement that the death in question occurred in \"1991,\" when it actually\noccurred a few weeks earlier, on December 19, 1990, F. 212, App. 1263, an\nentirely immaterial and obviously unintentional error, and, again, the use of\ntg°The trial co:tit; findings on _his subject, F. 210-1g, App. 1263-65, were adopted from\nBRI's proposed f'aldbgs 318-34, App. &,'5-84.\nt°\"The court's similar characterization of a letter on this subject from DMR's general\ncounsel to BRI's counsel is clearly erroneous for the same r¢ason. F. 218, App. 1265; Ex.\nU-146.\n\n131\nthe plural word \"deaths,\" which the Commissioner explained as a\ntypographical error. Tr. 1V:132-35. See also subsection 11, supra. Apart\nfront the court's stated disbelief of the Commissioner's explanation, which is\nnot itself evidence of some other motive, there was no basis for the court to\ninfer that the use of this word was an intentional misrepresentation. F. 212,\nApp. 1263.\nFinally, the court finds fault with the letter's statement that BRI's failure\nto file a v,xitlen report with the Commissioner's olllce \"made it impossible for\n[the Commissioner] to fulfull [his] responsibilities,\" i.e., to investigate the\ndeath. F. 21I, App. 1263. Because this death occurred and was reported in\n1990, prior to Mr. Campbell's tenure as Commissioner, he has no personal\nknowledge as to how, when, and where the death was reported or why the\nDepartment did not investigate the death upon receiving the oral report, via\nthe field ofl]ce) 92 Therefore, when the Commissioner was asked questions\nconcerning this statement during direct examination by BRI, his counsel\nrepeatedly objected on the grounds that the Commissioner had no personal\nknowledge of these events and that, therefore, these questions called for\nspeculation on his part. Tr. IV:95, 98, 100, 101,102. However, the court\nrequired the Commissioner to answer these questions over these repeated\nobjections.\nOn cross-examination by his own counsel, after the Commissioner had\nhad an opporlunity to examine the death report and other relevant documents,\nhe attempted to correct his earlier testimony on this subject. Tr. VI:30-37.\nHowever, before this line of questioning was completed, the court sustained\nBRI's objection that these questions called for speculation, the very same\nobjection that the court overruled when the Commissioner's counsel objected\nto BRI's questions on this subject. Tr. VI:36-37.\nSince the Commissioner had no personal knowledge of why no\ninvestigation was done in 1990, he should not have been required to answer\n192Astestified bythe Commissioner, his certification letters were drafted by his general\ncounsel, KimMar'dock, whowas working atDMRin 1990,whenthe deathreport was made.\nTr.IV: 161-62.\n\n132\nquestionson this subject in the first place. But having been required to\nanswer such questions on direct examination by BRI, he should have been\ngiven a full opportunity to correct his testimony on cross-examination by his\nown tourise[.\nIn any event, the Commissioner's testimony on this subject is consistent\nwith his general counsel's contemporaneous letter to BRI's counsel, which is\nin evidence for the truth of its contents. Ex. U-146. And there is no evidence\nin the record contradicting the Commissioner's truncated explanation of why\nthe death was not immediately investigated by DMR, i.e., that there was an\nongoing investigation by the local police, to which DMR ordinarily defers.\nTr. V1:36-37. Thus, the court's finding that the Commissioner testified\n\"falsely\" on the subject of this death report, F. 216, App. 1265, is clearly\nerroneous.\nIJ. There Is No Evidence that DMR's\nCommunications with New York State\nAgencies in February 1994 Caused New\nYork State to Remove Any Clients from\nBRL tg_\nThe court makes a series of findings about a (cancelled) meeting and a\ntelephone conference between DMR officials and their counterparts in New\nYork State, which the court characterizes as \"a continuation of the\nCommissioner's campaign of interfering with [BRI]'s relationship with its\nfunding agencies.\" F. 221, App. 1266. This characterization and the\nsubsidiary findings underlying it are clearly erroneous.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to support the court's finding that the\nmeeting in question was either requested or cancelled by DMR, as found by\nthe court, F. 220, App. 1265, rather than by the New York agency. Nor is\nzg:_Thetrialcourt's findings onthis subject, F.219-21, App. 1265-66, are adopted from\nBRI's proposed findings 335-40, App. 884-87.

In any event, since the\nmeeting did not even occur, there is no basis for the court's characterizing that\n\"meeting\" as \"a continuation of the Commissioner's campaign\" against BRI.\nNor was there an)' basis for inferring a causal connection between (1) a\ntelephone conference between DMR and New York State officials and (2)\nsubsequent letters from the New York agency to the parents of BRI students,\nrequesting their assistance in fommlating plans to enable their children to\nreturn home to New York. Ex. DMR-80. The only evidence of the content\nof the telephone conference was the stipulated testimony of a New York\nofficial, who stated that the conference was requested by his agency (not by\nDMR), Tr. X111:125-26, to obtain information on the current status of BRI's\ncertification. Ex. DMR-80. The evidence further indicates that New York's\nletters to BRI parents were motivated, not by an)' impetus from DMR, but by\nNew York's own long-standing goal, since prior to 1990, of returning all New\nYork clients to New York, Ex. DMR-80, a policy shared by other states and\nof which Dr. Israel was well aware. Tr. V111:94-95.\nNor was there any evidence that any New York studems were in fact\nremoved from BRI following that telephone call. To the contrary, the\nevidence shows that at least one new New York student, Duane B., was\nadmitted to BRI in February 1994) 9_ Ex. DMR-49, DMR-50.\n194This evidence directly contradicts the allegation inthe contempt complaint, which\nw'asverified byDr. Israelunder oath,that admissions from New York State had dropped to\nzero bythistime. App. 31I.\n\n134\n16. The Commissioner Had a Good Faith Basis\nfor Imposing the Conditions Contained in\nHis Certification Letter of February 9,\n1994. _9_\nBy letter dated February 9, 1994, the Commissioner continued BRI's\ncertification for another six months and indicated that, if BRI complied with\nthe stated conditions by May 8, 1994, the certification would be effective for\ntwo years from that date. Ex. U-139. In its findings, the court mentions only\nthree of the thirteen conditions contained in that letler.\nThe Commissioner's basis for imposing Condition I, which required BRI\nto demonstrate that it \"has in place a single v,xitten Behavior Modification\nPlan for each client, which plan fully complies with the requirements of [the\napplicable DMR regulations],\" is set forth in the letter itself: i.e., that the\nsample plan previously provided by BRI failed to comply with DMR's\nregulations in many important respects. Ex. U-139 at 5. The court's only\nfindings on this condition concern the amount of time that it took BRI's staff\nto comply with it. F. 225,228, App. 1267. However, the onerousness of this\ncondition, which merely tracks DMR's independently binding regulations, is\na function of how out of compliance BRrs existing plans were, not of the\nsubstantive reasonableness of the condition, which was not even questioned\nby the court.\nJgs-Ilaetrial court's findings on this subject, F. 222-30, App, 1266-68, are adopted from\nBRI's proposed findings 341-47, 354, 374; App. 891-95.\n\n135\nThe only two conditions that the court found to be unjustified, _96F. 229-\n30, App. 1267-68, were the conditions requiring independent psychiatric and\nmedical evaluations of BRrs clients. Ex. U-139 at 8, 11. As to the\npsychiatric evaluations, the court's finding that \"there was no basis for th[is]\nrequirement,\" F. 229, App. 1267, is clearly erroneous. The rationale for this\nrequirement is set forth in the letter itself--that DMR's review of the\npsychiatric evaluations provided by BRI's psychiatrist, Ex. DMR-43, _97\ndemonstrated \"a consistent problem,\" i.e., that BRI \"did not give adequate\nconsideration to causes of the individual's behavioral problems which might\nbe treated psychiatrically.\" Ex. U-139 at 9. As further explained, such\nconsideration is necessary in order to comply with the requirement that a\nprovider demonstrate, prior to using Level II1 aversives, that other, less\nintrusive, less restrictive, and less risky procedures have been exhausted. 104\nC.M.R. § 20.15(1)(c). Ex. U-139 at 9-10. At the very least, this constitutes\na good faith basis for imposing this requirement, regardless of whether the\nevaluations in fact revealed any unmet psychiatric needs. _98\nI'_ese finding5 arc further examples of the court's impermissibly placing the burden\non the Commissioner to demonstrate the good faith basis for his regulatory actions. Kg.,\nF. 230, App. 1268 (\"Commissioner Campbell could not identify any credible reason for the\nimposition of the condition regarding medical evalutaions.\"). See Argument I.E.2, supra.\nBy revie',,,,'ing the reasonableness of the conditions imposed by the Commissioner, the\ncourt also overstepped the bounds of its jurisdiction, since BRI had waived its right to\njudicial review of the February 9 decision by failing to exhaust its administrative remedies\nand then to seek such review in atimely manner, pursuant to G.L.c. 30A, §§ 13, 14;c. 19B,\n§ IS(d); and 104 C.M.R. §20.15(f)(8).\n19\"_Asindicated in that review, ever'}, one of BRl's own psychiatric evaluations\nrecommended continuation of aversives, and none recommended any medication or other\nalternative therapy. Ex. DMR-43.\n19Sin fact, contrary to the court's finding, F. 229, App. 1267, many of the psychiatric\nevaluations ultimately performed under this condition did recommend discontinuing or\nreducing the use of Level I11aversives, Ex. BRI-285 (evals. of William McC., John C.,\nKorren C., David MeK., Jacque W., Brendon S., Robert N., l)uane B., Gregory M., Rick G.,\nJose H., Caroline B., Butt S., Janine C., William H.); and many also identified possibly\nunmet psychiatric or psychopharmacological needs, ld (evals. of Mary Claire J., Edward\n(continued..,)\n\n136\nThe Commissioner's rationale for requiring medical evaluations is also\nreasonable on its face. As stated in the letter itself, \"The Department found\nthat, in a number of cases, BRI has not sufficiently considered possible\nmedical causes for behavior targeted for Level 111interventions.\" Ex. U- 139\nat 11. And, in fact, the medical evaluations performed pursuant to this\ncondition served their intended purpose of identifying unmet medical needs\nor recommending further evaluations in many cases) 99unlike BRI's own\nannual medical examinations, which were cursory and superficial. Ex. DMR-\n31.\nThere is no basis for the court's finding that these evaluations were\ndesigned, instead, to \"disrupt the operation of [BRI] and cause needless\nexpense.\" F. 230, App. 1268. The schedule for conducting these evaluations\nwas agreed to in advance by BRI, Ex. U-152, Condition 7; and there was no\nevidence that the evaluations caused any disruption of BRI's overall\noperation. Since the evaluations were paid for by DMR, they caused no\n\"needless expense\" on the pan of BRI? °° Nor were there any \"ethical\"\nproblems with conducting these evaluations, F. 224, App. 1267, since they\nwere conducted only with the prior, informed consent of each student's parent\nor guardian.

While BRIrefused topay forthese evaluations, itarranged and\npaidforitsown additional medical evaluationsduring the same time period. Ex. DMR-29,\n30, 31.\n\n137\n17. The Department Committed Extensive\nResources to Assisting BRI to Comply with\nDMR Regulations Rather than Simply\nDecerti_,ing BRl for Failure to Comply with\nthe February 9th Certification Conditions} °l\nAs described in the Statement of Facts, subsection A.4, although BRI had\nnot complied with the February 9 certification conditions by the deadline of\nMay 8, 1994. rather than decertify BRI, DMR entered intensive negotiations\nwith BRI, aimed at ensuring that BRI would ultimately comply with DMR\nregulations and thereby maintain certification. Those negotiations resulted\nin written agreements as to what BRI would do to comply with each of the\nconditions. See Statement of Facts, subsection A.4, supra.\nAll of the trial court's factual findings on the subject of these agreements\nshare the same erroneous premise: that the agreements reached between BRI\nand DMR as to how BRI would comply with each of the certification\nconditions instead imposed some obligations on DMR. In fact, the quid pro\nquo for BRI's agreeing to comply _th the conditions in the manner set forth\nin these agreements was that the Commissioner would not revoke BRI's\ncertification for failure to comply with those conditions by May 8, 1994, as\nthe Conunissioner's February 9th letter had warned. Ex. U-150, U-152. In\nfact, based on these agreements, the Commissioner extended BRI's\ncertification to December 31, 1994. Ex. U-152.\nNor did the Commissioner's letter of July 5, 1994, unconditionally\npromise that BRI would be finally re-certified six months later. Rather, the\nCommissioner stated that \"[a] two year certification will be issued to BR1/f\nthe Department determines that BRI has achieved compliance with the\ncertification conditions and regulations, and assuming no other changes in\nmaterial facts\" (emphasis added). U-152 at 2. In the same letter, the\nCommissioner reiterated that \"It]his certification decision is made without\n2°lThe lrial court's findings on this subject, F. 231-45, App. 1268-70, are adopled flora\nBRI's proposed findings 358-63,370-71,373-75, 377-79; App. 896-97, 899-901.\n\n138\nprejudice to the continuing authority of the Department to regulate BRI and\nto suspend, revoke, limit, or otherwise act upon BRI's certification or\nlicensure based upon any non-compliance with the attached agreements or\nconditions, or other violation of the law or regulations, or any changes in\nmaterial facts occurring during this certification period\" (emphasis added).\nld\nBecause, the court's premise--that DMR had the obligations under these\nagreements or under the Commissioner's conditional certification letter of\nJuly 5, 1994---is incorrect, it is unnecessary to address in detail the court's\nsubsidiary findings as to how the Commissioner \"violated\" those agreements,\nalthough those findings, as well, are factually unsupported by the evidence.\nFirst, the court finds that the Commissioner's determination (in his\nJanuary 20, 1995 letter), that BRI's treatment plans did not fully comply with\nDMR regulations, U-166 at 6, is somehow inconsistent 2°2with the parties'\nprior agreement requiting BRI to submit a sample treatment plan for DMR's\napproval and then to revise all of its other treatment plans using the approved\nsample as a model. Ex. U-152. The court does not find that BRI's revised\nplans, in fact, conformed to the sample plan, nor could the court make such\na finding, since the revised plans were not in evidence. In fact, the only\nevidence as to the adequacy of the revised plans fully supports the\nCommissioner's determination that the plans were deficient in the manner\ndescribed in his January 20, 1995 letter. Ex. U-166 at 2-7, DMR-4-9, DMR-\n23, DMR-67, DMR-69.\nThe only other \"violation\" found by the court concerns DMR's attempt,\nin December 1994, to have two outside experts review the implementation\nof two students' treatment plans. F. 243-45, App. 1269-70. However, after\nBRI objected and Judge Hurd, the court-appointed mediator, attempted\n2°_Thecourt does not explain how the Commissioner's Januao' 20th finding conflicts\nwith BRI's prior agreement to revise itstreatment plans inaccordance withthe approved\nsample, otherthan tofredthatBRrs psychologist, whohad draftedthe sampleplan that was\napproved by Dr.Cerreto,was \"shocked\" bytheCommissioner's finding. F.24I,App. 1269.\n\n139\nunsuccessfulltyoresolvethedispute2,°3thatreviewwascancelled. Tr. VIII:\n68-69, Ex. DMR-79. Therefore, the court's finding ti,at this \"review... was\nin violation of the July 5 agreement\" is clearly erroneous.\n18, The Commissioner Had a Goad Faith Basis\nfor Imposing the Conditions Contained in\nHis Certification Letter of Janua O, 20, 1995,\nand .(or Deeerti_,ing BRI for Refusing to\nComply with Those Conditions.2°4\nOver the next six months, from July through December 1994, DMR\nclosely monitored BRI's compliance with the certification conditions and\nwith the underlying regtdations. Tr. V:159-67. As a result of that intensive\nmonitoring, DMR determined, and informed BRI by letter dated January 20,\n1995, that BILl had not fully complied with the certification conditions or\nwith the applicable DMR regulations. Ex. U-166; Tr. V1:45-46.\nNevertheless, rather than decertify BRI on that basis, the Commissioner\ncontinued BRrs certification for another 16 months, to May 8, 1996, again\nwith certain conditions. Ex. U-166, Tr. VI:46-68.\nThe court finds fault with only two of the six conditions contained in the\nJanuary 20, 1995, letter. First, the court mischaracterizes Condition 1, by\nstating that it \"required that [BRI] discontinue Level III interventions for six\nindividuals.\" F. 249, App. 1270. In fact, this condition gave BRI a choice.\nIt could revise the treatment plans for those six individuals either to conform\nto DMR's regulations on Level 111 aversives (in which case BRI could\ncontinue to use such aversives, subject to the remaining conditions) or to\n2°3The court's finding that DMR refused to mediate this dispute is also clearly\nerroneous. Although DMR'scounsel initiallybelieved that the disputecould beresolved\nwithout mediation, Ex. U-160, when informalefforts provedunsuccessful, the partiesdid\nmediatethisissue with Judge Hard inDecember 1994. Ex.DMR-79.\n_Tbe trial court'sfindings onthissubject, F.247-5 I, App. 1270-7I,are adopted from\nBRI'sproposed findings 419-29, App. 917-22.\n\n140\nexclude Level 111aversives from these individuals' plans. In either case, the\nexisting treatment plans would remain in effect until the revised plans were\napproved by DMR, BRI's Peer Review and Human Rights Committees, and\nthe individual's parent or guardian or (for Level I11interventions) the Probate\nCourt. Ex.U-166at9, 10, 13.\nAs indicated in the letter itself, this condition was based on reports\nprepared by doctoral level psychologists who had closely monitored the\nimplementation of these individuals' treatment plans, as agreed to by the\nparties in June 1994. Ex. U-166 at 2; U-152, Condition 1; DMR-4-9. Those\nreports indicated that BRI had failed to implement the treatment plans of\nthese six individuals in accordance with DMR's behavior modification\nregulations, in the following significant respects: (I) BRI used Level Ill\ninterventions to address minor behaviors, such as slouching, silly laughing,\nand tearing paper; (2) BRI did not use the least restrictive and most\nappropriate interventions available; and (3) BRI's data collection procedures\ndid not provide for monitoring, evaluating, and documenting the use and\neffectiveness of particular interventions for treating particular behaviors. Ex.\nU.166 at 2-6, DMR-4-9, DMR-23.\nThe court's \"findings\" with respect to Condition 1 are actually legal\nconclusions, which should therefore be reviewed by this Court de no_'o.\nImplicit in the court's findings concerning the application of this condition to\nBrandon S., F. 249, App. 1270, are (1) the premise that this Condition\n\"conflicts\" with the Probate Court's prior approval of Brandon's individual\ntreatment plan in individual substituted judgment proceedings, and (2) the\nlegal conclusion that such a conflict renders this condition invalid as a matter\nof law. Both the premise and the conclusion are incorrect. As discussed in\nArgument I.B, supra, the function of the Probate Court in substituted\njudgment proceedings is solely to decide whether the individual, if\ncompetent, would consent to the proposed treatments. Although the criteria\nconsidered by the Probate Court in making that decision overlap to some\nextent with the requirements contained in DMR's behavior modification\nregulations, DMR's regulations are far broader. For example, while the\nProbate Court considers solely the written treatment plan, DMR's regulations\n\n141\nalsogovernthe mannerin whichthe court-approvedplan is actually\nimplementeodn a day-to-day basis. Therefore, DMR's determination that a\nstudent's gritten treatment plan is not being implemented in accordance with\nits regulations in no way conflicts with the Probate Court's determination that\nthe student would consent to the treatments set forth in the written plan.\nThe court's second \"finding,\" that DMR's regulations do not authorize the\nCommissioner to grant or deny certification to use Level II1 avetsives on an\nindividual basis, '°s F. 250, App. 1271, isalso incorrect as a matter of law. 2°_\nThe Department's behavior modification regulations expressly provide that\n\"[tlhe use of [Level lll] procedures for a particular individual will be\nallowed for aparticular client only after a rigorous review and approval by\nclinicians, human rights committees, and the Department .... It is further the\npolicy of the Department that the application of a procedure for clients even\nafter ithas been approved must be strictly monitored by the program as well\nas by the Department itself' (emphasis added). 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(1)(c).\nThe only other condition in the Commissioner's January 20th letter\nmentioned by the court is the condition requiring BRI to stop using the\n\"specialized food program,\" a food deprivation program in which, depending\non an individual's behavior on a given day, he or she may receive as little as\n20 percent of his or her daily caloric requirement. Ex. U-166 at 12.\nAlthough the court does not expressly find that this condition was\nunreasonable or imposed in bad faith, its findings suggest that there was no\n2°SThe court's factual finding that the January 20, 1995, letter \"first introduced the\nconcept of regulatory approval of treatment plans on a 'case-by.case' basis,\" F. 250, App.\n1271, is clearly erroneous. As the Commissioner testified, DMR has approved or\ndisapproved the use of Level 111aversives ona case-by.case basis for individuals at the state\nschools for the mentally retarded and has also authorized another private provider to seek\ncertification on acase-by-case basis. Tr.V:26-27. There was noevidence to the contrao'.\n2°_rhis is another issue that could have and should have been raised, if at all, in an\nadministrative appeal by BIU from this decision. Having forgone this available\nadminisU'ative remedy, BRI was not entitled tojudicial review of this decision, particularly\nin the context of acontempt proceeding.\n\n142\nclinical justification for imposing this condition? °7 An)' such finding is\nclearly erroneous.\nAs indicated in the January 20 letter itself and in the report that the\nCommissioner issued in support of that letter, there was anlple justification\nfor imposing this condition. This condition was based on DMR's\ndetermination that there is no professional literature to support the use of this\nprocedure as treatment for human beings in general or for the problems\nexhibited by BRI clients in particular. Ex. U-166 at 12. In addition, DMR\nfound thal this program \"denies the client basic sustenance,\" thereby\nviolating the regulatory requirement that \"[n]o Behavior Modification plan\nmay provide for a program of treatment which denies the individual.., a\nnutritionally sound diet.\" 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(4)(b)(1). Ex. U-166 at 12. In\nfurther support of this condition, DMR's accompanying report outlined and\ndocumented specific nutritional and sanitation problems with the specialized\nfoed program as well as evidence that this intervention is not only ineffective\nin controlling the targeted problem behaviors but may actually cause or\nincrease other problem behaviors that are then treated with other Level 111\ninterventions. Ex. DMR-23 at 47-53. In addition, several of the psychiatric\nand medical evaluations of individual students raised concerns about adverse\neffects of this program on the students being evaluated. Ex. DMR-284 (eval.\nof Jennifer H.), DMR-285 (evals. of Elly N., Jeanine C., William H., and\nJennifer H.). At the very least, the Commissioner had a good faith basis for\nimposing this condition.\n2°TTheframing ofthe court'sfinding on thiss:Jbjectisanother example of itsimproperly\nplacing the burden on the Commissioner to explain the good faith basis for his regulatory\nactions, i.e.,\"he failed to identif)' any medical evidence tosupport thisdecision.\" F.251,\nApp. 1271.\n\n143\n19. DMR Dealt Fairly with BRI on Contract\nIssues. :°8\nAs discussed in the Statement of Facts, section C, in recent years, BRrs\ntuition rates for Massachusetts clients have been set by the Division of\nPurchased Services C'DPS\"). Ex. BR1-292; Tr. V:112, VIII:165-67. DPS\nsets a fiat per-student rate (about $161,000 for BRI in 1994-95, Tr. VII1:167),\nregardless of the level of services provided to each individual client. Ex.\nBRI-292; Tr. V:112. This is not the method generally used by DMR and\nother state agencies to establish the amounts paid to providers of services to\nadult clients. Rather, these amounts are usually set by negotiated contracts\nspecific to each client for whom services are provided. Tr. I11:270, V:I 13-17.\nIt was for this reason (and not for the ulterior motives found by the court, F.\n200, App. 1258) that DMR questioned, in December 1993, v,'hether DPS\nshould continue to set BRrs rate, in that BRI was then serving no\nMassachusetts students trader the age of 22. Ex. BRI-262 at 4; Tr. I11:266-70.\nDMR's more recent attempts to negotiate a contract with BRI were\nsimilarly well-intentioned. Despite DMR's repeated efforts to initiate\ncontract negotiations, beginning in the fall of 1994, 209as of the end of the\n1995 fiscal year DMR and BRI still had not entered into either an agreement\nto abide by the DPS rates or an)' other contlactual arrangement for fiscal year\n1996.\nNevertheless, in order to continue contract negotiations into the new\nfiscal year, on June 30, 1995, the last day of the 1995 fiscal year (and,\ncoincident,'dly, the fifth day of the contempt trial), DMR \"prequalified\" BRI\n_'he trial court's findings on this subject, F. 197-202,256-61; App. 1258-59, 1272-74,\nareadopted from BRI's proposed findings 298-304, 434-38; App. 865-67, 923-25.\n2'_DMR at'tempted to initD,e contract negotiations in September and October of 1994\nand, inDecember of 1994, restated its willingness to meet with BRI on this issue, but BRI\ndid not come tothe negotiating table until mid-June 1995. Tr. X1:264-67; Ex. DMR-60, U-\n161.\n\n144\nto enter into a contract with DMR for fiscal year 1996, on the condition that\nBRI cooperate v_ith DPS's then-pending request for information concerning\nBILl's legal expenses? m Ex. BRI-267. DPS had sought that information in\norder to determine whether BRI's rate for prior fiscal years should be\nreduced, retroactively, to account for nonreimbursable expenditures for\nlobbying and for legal fees incurred in suing the Commonwealth. ld\nOver the Commissioner's objections, the trial court admitted DMR's\nprequalification letter and DPS's request for information de bene, subject to\nBRI's ability to offer testimony linking DMR to DPS's request for\ninformation on BRI's legal expenses. Tr. VI:168-69. Although BRI later\nconceded that it was unable to prove such a connection and therefore did not\nintroduce further evidence on this issue, Tr. IX:56-57, the court nevertheless\nrelied on the conditionally admitted evidence to infer that \"the letter ''2\"\nconstituted a purposeful attempt by DMR to interfere with on-going court\nproceedings.\" F. 259, App. 1273.\nApart from the inadmissibility of the only evidence on this issue, even\nthat evidence does not support the court's inference that requiring BRI's\ncooperation with DPS's request for information was an attempt by DMR to\ninterfere with the on-going contempt trial. DPS's letter clearly indicates that\nits request for information was just the first step in a long administrative\nprocess, including the availability of appeals, before any action would be\ntaken affecting BRI's funding. Ex. BRI-267. Moreover, since the\nCommonwealth funds only a small percentage of BRI's students, even if DPS\neventually took steps to recoup overpaymer_ts for Massachusetts students,\n2J°Th¢court mischaracterizes DPS's letter,as \"[finding] [BRI]'s legal fees to be non-\nreimbursable,\" and \"subject to recoupment.\" F. 258, App. 1273. In fact, DPS only\nrequested information from BRI forpurposes ofdetermining the reimbursability of its legal\nfees and stated that, depending onwhat the requested information shows, \"the funds may be\nsubject torecoupment\"(emphasis added). The mischaracterizations aretaken verbatim from\nBRI's proposed finding 436, App. 924.\n2\"It is unclear whether the letler referred to here is DMR's prequalification letler or\nDPS's request for information.\n\n145\nthis would not have the drastic effects, hypothesized by the court, of\n\"'disrupting [BRI]'s ability to continue to retain its counsel.\"\n20. The Commissioner Acted Reasonably in\nGiving BRI Additional Time to Correct\nDeficiencies Identified by a Licensing\nSurve),. 2_2\nIn 1994, DMR conducted surveys of licensed residential programs, using\nnewly revised licensing standards, referred to as \"QUEST,\" (Quality\nEnhancement Survey Tool). Tr. X:33-35. Although BRI was rated \"partially\nachieved\" or \"not achieved\" in all categories of this survey, Ex. U-164 at 1,\nits group home licenses were not revoked, Ex. U-183, and remained in effect\nat the time of trial. Tr. X:35. As explained in a letter from DMR's Director\nof Survey and Certification, if this survey process eventually results in BRI's\ngroup home licenses being revoked or suspended, BRI will have an\nopportunity to appeal any such action pursuant to 115 C.M.R., §§ 8.21(4),\n8.33(1)(b), and 8.34, and to seek judicial review of any adverse\nadministrative decision pursuant to G.L.c. 30A, § 14.\nDespite the \"unripe\" procedural posture of BRI's license renewals, the\ncourt made adverse findings as to the procedure and substance of the\nlicensing survey. Those findings were clearly erroneous. First of all, the\ncourt mischaracterizes, by quoting out of context, the actual findings of the\nsurveyors? _3 The court's selective list of infractions also creates the false\n2122qaI¢rial court'sfindings onthis subject, F.261-66, App. 1274-75, are adoptedfrom\nBRI's proposed findings 439-46, App. 926-31.\n2m3Froexample, whilethe courtstatesthat\"DMRfauhed [BRI]staff forthe affectionate\nand caring interaction withthe studentsbecause 'they _'ere not reflective of positive adult\nroles,'\" F. 263 n.5, App. 1275, the survey actually stated,\"Although interactions were\naffectionate and caring,they were not reflective of positive adult roles\" (emphasis added).\nEx. U-164 at l. The survey further elaborates on this pointbystating that, although most\nBRIclients are over 21yearsold, they are \"consistently referred toas 'kids'\"; aretold they\n(continued...)\n\n146\nimpression that all of the deficiencies related to client dignity. F. 263 n. 65,\nApp. 1275. In fact, the survey also found deficiencies in all other areas,\nincluding client safety, Ex. U-164 at 36-39, human rights, and personal well-\nbeing, ld. at 48-51. Since the only evidence on the QUEST survey were the\nsurvey findings themselves, there was no basis for the court to conclude that\nthe survey findings were \"arbitrary and capricious. ''214 F. 263, App. 1275.\n21. The Court's Findings Grossly Overstate the\nEvidence of Harm to BRI and lts Students. 2_s\nThe court's findings that the Commissioner's actions \"financially\ndevastated\" BRI, F. 269, App. 1277, and caused it \"to suffer a loss of\nrevenues of such magnitude that its financial viability is in peril,\" F. 270,\nApp. 1277, are dearly erroneousfl 6 First of all, according to the court, the\ndirect cause of BRrs decrease in revenues is its declining enrollment, ld\nHowever, as discussed in subsection 8.a, supra, the court's inference that\nBRI's declining enrollment was caused by the Commissioner's conduct---i.e.,\n213(...continued)\nare\"good boysandgirls\"; andaregiven children'stoys asrewards, Ex.

Although declining enrollment necessarily\nresulted in a loss in revenues, it also presumably resulted in decreased costs,\nsince BRI's tuition rate is set on the basis of its average costs per student. Tr.\nV:112. In any event, as BRJ's accountant testified, and as the court found,\nBRI continues to enjoy a $520,000 surplus, Tr. VI11:171; F. 302, App. 1285,\nonly $65,000 less than in 1993. F. 300, App. 1285Y s Although the court\nfound that this surplus would be eliminated, and BRJ's credit line thereby\njeopardized, if BRI were to use the surplus to pay its attorneys' fees, F. 303,\nApp. 1286, there is no evidence that BRI has actually paid or ever intends to\npay the more than $800,000 of fees assertedly billed by its counselY 9\nMoreover, as discussed in subsection 19, supra, unless DPS takes some\naction to recoup the funds that BRI expended on this litigation, BRI will\ncontinue to be reimbursed for its legal fees through its tuition.\n2t7BRI'saccountant admittedthat nothinginhisanalysis of BRI's finances providesany\ninformation astothe causefor BRI'sdeclining enrollment. Tr. VIII: 193-94. Moreover, he\ntestified that enrollment hadnotdeclined severely asof June of 1994,Tr. VIII: 193,which\nprecludes the inference, made by the court, that the decline in enrollment was the direct\nresult of letters sentby the Commissioner inAugust and December of 1993. F.290 n.73,\nApp. 1282. Infact,inthesummerof 1994,BRIhadatleastasmany students (57), Ex.BR1-\n284, as ithad in 1991,when itfirst applied forre-certification. Ex.BRI-236.\nZttThis isconsistent withDr. Israel's statement,inMarch of 1995, that BRI is\"alive,\nwell and prospering.\" Ex. DMR-35.\n219Asdiscussed inArgument IV.B, infra,the court'sfindingthat thisamountof feeswas\n\"necessary and reasonable\" is also clearly erroneous and unsupported by the requisite\nsubsidiary fmdings.\n\n148\nThe court's findings of harm to the students are also clearly erroneous. 22°\nThe findings that declining enrollment caused loss of revenues, which caused\nlayoffs, which caused less individual attention to the remaining students, F.\n293, 294, 295, App. 1283-84, are fallacious on their face; if staffare laid off\nin proportion to the drop in enrollment, then the staff-to-student ratio should\nremain approximately the same.\nThe only findings of concrete, physical harm to individual students\nconcern the effects on two students of the cessation of the specialized food\nprogram in June 1995721 The evidence on this subject falls faa short of\nsupporting the court's finding that the cessation of this program \"critically\nimpacted\" two students \"who are currently suffering a dramatic increase in\ntheir health-dangerous behaviors.\" F. 298, App. 1284.\nAs to one of the students, Wayne M., Dr. Von Heyn, a BRI psychologist,\ntestified that, after BRI stopped using the specialized food program, Wayne\nhad to be restrained on one occasion. Tr. IX:96. Although he testified that\nthe use of such restraints on this student \"used to be infrequent,\" that\ntestimony is directly contradicted by a progress report for the month of\nJanuary 1995 (when the specialized food program was still in use), which\nindicates that Wayne was placed in leg restraints for 634 minutes, waist\nrestraints for 675 minutes, wrist straps for 15,298 minutes, and a helmet for\n230 minutes in that one month \"alone. Ex. DMR-21.\nAs to the other student, Janine C., both Dr. Von Heyn and the student's\nfather testified that, after cessation of the specialized food program, she\npulled her hair and picked her finger. Tr. IX:97-98; X:6. However, on cross-\nexamination, they both admitted that she had engaged in these same\nbehaviors when she was on the specialized food program. Tr. IX:99; X:I4.\nIn her psychiatric evaluation, the evaluator states that \"according to multiple\n22°To the extent that the findings of harmto students are based on the evidence of\nfinancial harm toBRI, those findingsshouldbesetaside forthe samereasonsjust discussed.\n221Forthe reasons discussed inArgument II.B,supra, the evidence presented bythe\nparentsonthis subject should have beenexcluded orslricken.\n\n149\nstaff reports, these episodes [of self-mutilation and hair pulling] did not\nappear to have any external precipitant. They appear to have occurred in\n1990, 1992 and then most recently in November and December of 1993.\"\nEx. BR1-285. 2_2 Furthermore, given the evaluator's recommendation that\nJanine's daily caloric intake be increased in order to avoid exacerbating her\nhypoglycemia, 22_an)' harm she suffered by the cessation of the specialized\nfood program was most likely outweighed by this benefit, ld.\nThus, the court's subsidiary findings of harm to BRI and its students are\nclearly erroneous and its charcterizations of that harm as \"devastating\" and\n\"perilous\" are grossly exaggerated. The court's errors in assessing the nature\nand degree of harm are particularly prejudicial, since the harm found forms\nthe basis for the drastic relief imposed by the court. Conversely, since the\ncourt's findings on this issue are clearly erroneous, the relief granted to\nremedy that harm is unwarranted.\nIV. THE EXTRAORDINARY RELIEF GRANTED BY THE\nTRIAL COURT IS UNJUST AS A MATTER OF EQUITY\nAND IMPROPER ASA MATTER OF LAW.\nTo remedy the harm discussed above, the court appointed a receiver to\nassume all of DMR's regulatory authority over BRI, \"as well as any\nadditional powers as may be necessary and appropriate.\" App. 1342. The\ncourt also enjoined the Commissioner, \"his agents, attorneys, employees, and\nanyone acting in concert with them,\" from \"tak]ingJany action to obstruct,\nfrustrate or interfere with the Receiver in the performance of his duties,\" App.\n1348, and from \"seek[ing] to accomplish through Individual Guardianship\nproceedings what they are enjoined from doing herein.\" App. 1341-42. In\n222Seealso Ex. DMR-47 at 5 (BRI Human Rights Committee minutes, 10/25/93,\nreferring to \"Janine's recent episodes of health dangerous behaviors\").\n223Similar recommendations were made with respect to other students who were on the\nspecialized food program at the time of their evaluations. Ex. DMR-284 (Jennifer H.),\nDMR-285 (Elly N., William H., Jennifer H.).\n\n150\naddition to this sweeping equitable relief, the court awarded over $1 million\nin attorneys' fees. App. 1341. As will be shown in this final section of this\nbrief, even if the court's contempt findings were legally and factually sound,\nthis extraordinary relief is unwarranted and should therefore be vacated by\nthis Court.\nA. In Issuing the Receivership Orders and Other\nBroad-Ranging Injunctive Relief, the Trial Court\nAbused Its Discretion, Exceeded Its Authority, and\nImpermissibly Intruded on the Powers of the\nLegislative and Executive Branches.\nThe Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in\nIi\nImposing the Drastic Remedy of\nReceivership on the Facts of This Case.\nEven if the trial court's contempt judgment were factually or legally\nwand, itwould not justify the extraordinary relief granted by the trial court.\nAs this Court counseled in denying a petition for mandamus relief against a\nstate official, \"The severity of remedial devices which may be considered [to\nenforce judgments against the Commonwealth] demands caution.., not a\nresort to extraordinary judicial intervention.\" Bromfield v. Treasurer &\nReceiver General, 390 Mass. 665, 670 (1983); see also Massachusetts\nCoalition for the Homeless v. Secretary of Human Services, 400 Mass. 806,\n823-24 (1987). Even in the face of systemic violations of constitutional\nrights, the equitable powers of courts to award relief against state and local\nofficials is not unlimited. Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 51 (1990).\nAs to the extraordinary remedy of receivership, this Court has held that,\neven in the private business context, the power to appoint a receiver should\nbe exercised \"vAth circumspection. It should not be exercised except in cases\nwhere otherwise there would be wasting and loss of property.., which\ncannot be conserved in any other way.\" New England Theatres, Inc'. v.\nOlympia Theatres, Inc., 28\"1Mass. 485, 492 (1934), cert. denied, 294 U.S.\n\n151\n713 (1935); see also George Ahman, Inc. v. Vogue, Int,, lne, 366 Mass.176,\n180 (1974) (same). Where the deficiencies found by the trial court do not\n\"necessitate th[is] drastic remedy,\" this Court has held that \"the trial judge's\nappointment of a receiver clearly exceeded the bounds of his authority,\"\nLopez v. MedfordCommunity Center, Inc., 384 Mass. 163, 169 (1981), and\ndirected that \"[a] more limited remedy.., be fashioned\" to address the\nparticular deficiencies identified by the trial court, ld. at 170.\nAdditional problems arise where, as here, receivership is sought as a\nremedy against govemment agencies, in which case \"a receivership must be\nthoroughly justified on the facts, is always to be considered a remedy of'last\nresort,' and therefore is not often applied in practice.\" Perez v. Boston\nHousing Authority, 379 Mass, 703,733 (1980). Accordingly, in affirming\nthe appointment of a receiver under the extraordinary circumstances of the\nPerez case, this Court was careful to note that, because of the quasi-private\ncharacter of the BHA, \"that remedy appears much less drastic\" than it would\nwhere it \"invade[s] any 'line' department or unit of city or State. 'm4 ld. at\n738.\nIn this respect, the remedy of receivership--which entirely supplants the\nCommissioner's discretion as to how to carry out his statutory duties---is even\nmore drastic than other forms of equitable relief which specify how an\nadministrative agency must perform its discretionary functions. The\nseparation of powers problems inherent in such injunctive orders therefore\napply to an even greater degree to the relief granted here. As this Court has\nrepeatedly recognized in overturning injunctions against state agencies, even\nwhere judicial remedies are warranted, the relief must be fashioned so as to\npreserve the agencies' discretion to determine how to perform their statutory\nand regulatory duties. Care and Protection of Jeremy, 419 Mass. 616, 622-\n23 (1995); Care and Protection oflsaac, 419 Mass. 602, 606-07 (1995);\n_24AIthough various state officials were originally namedasdefendants in the Perez\ncase. theyweredismissedontheground that the statuteunderwhich plaintiffs sought relief\nwas notapplicable tothem. Perezv.8HA, 36g Mass. 333, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1009\n(1975). The Commissionerisaware ofno reported cases inwhich a stateagency has been\nplacedinreceivership.\n\n152\nGuardianship of Anthony, 402 Mass. 723, 727 (1988); Bradley v.\nCommissioner of Mental Health, 386 Mass. 363, 365 (1982). Indeed, in a\nprevious appeal in this very case, this Court vacated, on these grounds, an\ninjunction issued by the Bristol Probate Court requiring DMR to pay BRI for\nits care of a particular student. In the Matter of McKnight, 406 Mass. 787,\n801-02 (1990) (vacating injunction on the grounds that \"[tlhe determination\nof where and how the department will carry out its statutory, regulator),, and\nany constitutional obligations, is... for it to decide\"); see also Charrier v.\nCharrier, 416 Mass. 105, 110 (1993) (\"judge does not have authority to order\n[state agency] to do anything that [agency] is not required to do as a matter\nof law\"; to do so \"would violate the principle of separation of powers.., by\nusurping an executive function\").\nThe facts of this case, as found by the trial court, fall far short of the\ncircumstances that were held to warrant the appointment of a temporary\nreceiver for the Boston Housing Authority in the Perez case. In that case, this\n\"exceptional\" remedy was reluctantly imposed as an \"ultimate recourse,\"\nwhere \"[t]he unabated mis- and nonfeasance of the Board\" resulted in \"the\nunprecedented deterioration of the BHA's developments and.., widespread\nviolations of the Sanitary Code,\" id. at 705, 724-26, which directly\njeopardized the health and safety of thousands of tenants. In particular, the\nBHA failed to fill top management positions, id. at 717-19; failed to engage\nin financial planning, id. at 718-19; failed to deliver maintenance supplies to\ntenants, id at 719-20; failed to supervise or prioritize maintenance work, id.\nat 719-20; and failed to protect the safety of tenants from physical and\npsychological invasion, ld at 721-22. Due to the Board's \"incompetence,\"\n\"indifference,\" and \"gross mismanagement,\" the physical condition of public\nhousing was found to be \"appalling,\" and violations of the sanitary code,\n\"rampant.\" ld. at 725.\nBy contrast, in the present case, far from neglecting their statutory and\nregulatory responsibility to ensure the health, safety, and dignity of BRI's\nclients, the Commissioner and his staff were found to have aggressively\nmonitored and regulated BRrs compliance with state regulations. F. 268-85,\nApp.1276-81. Although the court found the degree of regulatory activity to\n\n153\nbeexcessiveu,nnecessaray,ndill-motivated2,2Fs.230,268-85;App. 1268,\n1276-81, there are no findings that this regulator), activity directly resulted\nin any serious or pervasive harm to the health or safety of BRI's clients.\nRather, as discussed in Argument III.B.21, supra, the harm found by the\ncourt was primarily to BRI's financial well-being, which was found to result\nin a reduction in staffing and, in turn, in a general reduction in the quantity\nand quality of services provided. F. 268-85, App.1276-81. Moreover, there\nis no finding that even this financial harm ever reached crisis proportions ill\nany way comparable to Perez. Nor, unlike in the Perez case, is there any\nfinding that the quality of services currently provided by BRI has declined to\na level that necessitates the drastic remedy of receivership in order to protect\nthe health and safety of its student body as a whole? 26 To the contrary, the\ncourt lauded the quality of services provided by BRI's staff, F. 264, App.\n1275, and, in denying the Department's counterclaims, rejected each and\nevery one of the Department's contentions that BRI had failed to provide the\nlevel of service required by DMR regulations. App. 1322-39.\nNor was this relief the only means of addressing any regulatory\nwrongdoing by the Commissioner. If BRI was aggrieved by the\nCommissioner's certification, investigatory, or licensing decisions, on\nsubstantive or procedural grounds, it had the right to seek administrative and,\nif necessary, judicial review, which it failed to do. If warranted, the\nreviewing Superior Court could \"set aside or modify the decision, or compel\nany action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\" G.L.c. 30A,\n225Asshown inArgument Ill.B, supra, these f'mdings are clearly erroneous.\n226The one finding of harm to an individual student, .I.C., v,ho was found to require\nincreased use of other aversives at_er being removed from the specialized food program, F.\n298, App. _284, could have been remedied, if necessary, by a narrowly focused injunction,\nrequiring DMR to permit BRI to utilize the specialized food program on this individual\nstudent at least temporarily. CJ?McKnight, 406 Mass. at 801 (indicating that a temporary\ninjunction requiring DMR to continue the availability of aversive procedures might be\nwarranted if the requisite showing of immediate and irreparable harm were made, but\nholding that \"[n]o permanent injunction should be entered to that effect.., unless [the\nindividual] proves that the department, acting on the judgment of qualified professionals,\ncould not reasonably deny the continued availability and use of aversives\").\n\n154\n§14(7). BRI's failure to exhaust these available legal remedies barred the\ngranting of any equitable relief, particularly the most extreme remedy of\nreceivership. George Airman, 366 Mass. at 180 (\"in order to justify the\nappointment of [a receiver], it should at least appear.., that [the applicant]\nhas exhausted his legal remedies\").\nAlternatively, in lieu of the sweeping relief granted here, the trial court\ncould have issued discrete injunctive orders tailored to address any particular\ninstances of ongoing and harmful wrongdoing. See, e.g., Halderman v.\nPennhurst State School & Hospital, 154 F.R.D. 594, 610 (E.D. Pa. 1994)\n(finding state officials in contempt of settlement agreement and issuing\ninjunctive orders requiring them to take particular actions, e.g., to provide\ncommunity living arrangements to all Philadelphia class members within 12\nmonths, with coercive fines if defendants fail to comply with those orders);\nCoyne Industrial Laundry of Schenectady, Inc. v. Gould, 359 Mass. 269\n(1971 ) (finding defendant in contempt of consent decree prohibiting it from\nsoliciting dust control business and issuing an order requiring it to cease and\ndesist from doing so); Manchester v. DEQE, 381 Mass. at 209 (finding town\nin contempt of court order setting deadlines for town to take various actions\nto bring dump into compliance with state law and issuing an order requiring\ntown to act according to new compliance schedule).\nBy, instead, imposing the extraordinary remedy of receivership, the trial\ncourt failed to heed this Court's admonitions that this extreme sanction should\nbe imposed only where it is fully justified by the facts and only as a last\nresort where other, less drastic remedies have failed to preserve the assets of\nthe entity placed in receivership (not those of the entity seeking\nreceivership) 227or to protect the health and safety of those served by public\ninstitutions. The receivership orders should therefore be vacated in toto even\nif the contempt judgment is otherwise upheld.\n2271fthe assets of BRI are truly at risk, and its students' health and safety are thereby\njeopardized, aswas the case with respect to the assets and tenants of the BHA in Peter, this\nmight justify placing BR/in receivership, but not DMR.\n\n155\n2. The Plenary Powers Granted to the Receiver\nin this Case Are Overly Broad,\nUnconstitutional, and in Conflict with\nVarious Statutory Provisions.\nEven if some form of receivership were warranted by the circumstances\nof this case, the extremely broad powers granted here should be vacated on\nequitable, statutory, and constitutional grounds. Injunctive relief, even where\nothen_ise warranted, must be narrowly tailored to redress the particular legal\nwrong found by the court. Here, the legal _;rong found by the court is of\nrelatively limited scope, affecting a single provider and relating primarily to\nits certification to use certain particularly intrusive behavior modification\nprocedures. Yet, the receiver is authorized not simply to right these \"wrongs\"\nbut to \"exercise all powers presently held by DMR as well as any additional\npowers as may be necessary and appropriate,\" including, for example, the\npower to reorganize the structure of the entire Department; to supervise, hire,\nand fire all DMR employees, including the Commissioner himself; and \"to\ndevelop and to improve DMR's management systems, personnel standards,\nemployee relations so that anti-BRl bias is eliminated.\" App. 1342-47.\nTaken together, these provisions empower the receiver to conduct a purge of\nDMR employees solely on ideological grounds.\nA further infirmity with many of the enumerated powers of the receiver\nis that they exceed the powers of either DMR or the court itself under the\nstate and federal constitutions. Under Amendment Article 63 of the\nMassachusetts Constitution, and G.L.c. 29, § 2, no state agency has the\npower to receive or spend money without an appropriation, even pursuant to\na court order. Manchester v. DEQE, 381 Mass. at 218-19; Bromfield, 390\nMass. at 671; cf. Evans v. City of Chicago, 10 F.3d at 480 (\"judges should not\ntake con_ol of the budgetary process even with the consent of the parties\").\nYet, the receiver is empowered to \"apply for and accept funds on behalf of\nDMR from any public or private entity or person,\" App. 1345; and to\n\"contract for such legal, accounting, professional or consultant services\nfurnished directly to the Receiver as he finds necessary for the performance\n\n156\nof his duties.., and direct DMR to pay the costs therefor.\" App. 1347.\nDMR is also required to pay the receiver himself at an hourly rate of$150.\nApp. 1343. 228\nSeveral of the receiver's powers also run afoul of ,sxticle 30 of the\nDeclaration of Rights, which requires a strict separation of powers between\nthe executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. New Bedford\nStandard-Times Publishing Co. v. Clerk of the Third District Court of\nBristol, 377 Mass. 404, 410 (1979) (\"Article 30... is more explicit than the\nFederal Constitution in calling for the separation of powers of the three\nbranches of government, and we have insisted on scrupulous observance of\nits limitations.\"). While the judicial appointment of a receiver, per se, may\nnot be an impermissible intrusion on executive powers (at least where the\nagency placed in receivership is a quasi-private entity rather than an\nexecutive department of state government and has failed to carry out its\nstatutory duties), Perez, 379 Mass. at 739 and n. 36, a court-appointed\nreceiver may not exercise powers that conflict with state statutes. 2_ Spence\nv. Reeder, 382 Mass. 398, 418 (1981) (court could not empower BHA\nreceiver to evict tenants in a manner inconsistent with tenants' rights under\nexisting statutes). As stated by this Court, with respect to the BHA\n22sWhile,insome extraordinarycircumstances(unlikethose presentedhere), thecourts\nhave inherentauthority to require expenditures without appropriation, O'Coins, Inc. v.\nTreasurer of Worcester County, 362 Mass. 507, 509 (1972) (county could be ordered to\npurchase taperecorderand tapes necessary foroperationof criminalcourts), thatpower may\nbe exercised only where such expenditures are essential to the fulfillment of the court's\nconstitutional obligations, County ofBarnstable v. Commonwealth, 410 Mass. 326, 333\n(1991), and,eventhen, only withthe prior written approval ofthe Chief Justice of the court\ninquestion and notice tothe Chief Justice ofthis Court. O'Coins, 362 Mass. at 516; SJC\nRule 1:05.\n229Tothe extentthat the receiver'spowers enable himtoexercise executive functions\n(such as hiringand firing of personnel, enteringand terminating contracts, and spending\nfunds appropriated bythe Legislature)withoutthe statutory constraintsthat otherwise apply\ntotheexerciseofthese functions by stateofficials,thosepowers also runafoul ofAtticle XX\nof the Declaration of gights, which vests the \"power of suspending the laws, or the\nexecution ofthe laws\"exclusively inthe Legislature. MBTA Advisor), Board _:MBTA, 382\nMass. 569, 578(1981).\n\n157\nreceivership, \"The principle of separation of powers requires that the court\nnot inlrude into an area that is fundamentally legislative.\" Id. at 418. Nor\nmay a receiver, ajudicial officer, perform functions that have been statutorily\ndelegated to the executive branch, Brach v. Chief Justice of the District Court\nDepartment, 386 Mass. 528, 538 (1982), particularly where the executive\npowers in question have been assigned to executives outside of the\ndepartment whose operation the receiver is appointed to oversee. Cf. Perez,\n379 Mass. at 739-40 (receivership does not derogate from separation of\npowers where municpal agency's powers are taken over by receiver as\nremedy for that agency's violation of law).\nIn this case, many of the receiver's enumerated powers intrude\nimpermissibly on the powers of the legislative and executive branches. For\nexample:\n(1) The receiver's power to create positions, App. 1346, is a legislative\nprerogative. Commissioner of Administration v. Kelley, 350 Mass. 501,505\n(1966).\n(2) The receiver's power to prosecute, defend, and settle lawsuits on\nbehalf of DMR, App.1346, directly conflicts with G.L.c. 12, § 3, by which\nthe Legislature delegated this authority exclusively to the Attorney General.\nFeeney v. Commonwealth, 373 Mass. 359, 366 (1977); cf. Commonwealth v.\nGordon, 410 Mass. 498, 500 (1991) (judge cannot exercise prosecutor's\ndiscretion not to prosecute an indictment).\n(3) The receiver's power to \"contract on behalf of DMR with any private\nentity or person for any lawful purpose to perform any function currently or\npreviously performed by DMR,\" App. 1345, conflicts with the Pacheco Law,\nG.L.c. 7, §§ 52-55, which strictly curtails the power of state agencies to\nconu'act with private entities to provide services previously provided by the\nstate agencies well as other public bidding and contracting statutes, G.L.c.\n29 §§ 29A-29B, imposingvarious procedural and substantive requirements\nfor the letting of state contracts.\n(4) The receiver's power to retroactively review DMR's previous\nregulatory decisions, which BRI failed to appeal in a timely manner, and to\nmodify or rescind those decisions \"as is required,\" App. i343-44, directly\n\n158\nconflictswiththetime limits and deferential standards for judicial review of\nsuch decisions under G.L.c. 30A, § 14, which would otherwise apply.\n(5) The receiver's power to remove the Commissioner, App. 1346, is a\npower that has been statutorily assigned to the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services. G.L.e. 19B, § 2; cf. McGonigle v. The Governor, 418\nMass. 147, 150-51 (1994) (Governor had no power to remove county sheriff,\nwhere statute conferred that power on Supreme Judicial Court).\n(6) The receiver's power to unilaterally \"disaffirm, reject or discontinue\nat an)' time any.., personal or professional services and material contracts,\"\nApp. 1346, not only conflicts with the statutes governing collective\nbargaining and procurement of services by the state but also raises serious\nproblems under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, insofar as the receiver's termination or breach of existing\ncontracts leaves the vendors without either a contractual remedy or \"just\ncompensation\" for their goods or services.\nAll of these constitutional problems with the receiver's powers are\nexacerbated by the court's grant to the receiver of immunity from suit in any\nforum arising from the exercise of these powers, App. 1349-50, immunity\nwhich exceeds even that of the court itself. Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522,\n528-44 0984) (state court judges not immune from prospective injunctive\nrelief or attorney's fees for civil rights violations). Apart from the court's\ndoubtful authority to grant such immunity, this grant of immunity deprives\nthird parties, including DMR employees, unions, vendors, and clients, of any\nrecourse for violation of their constitutional, statutory, collective bargaining,\ncontractual, or common law rights by the receiver. This wholesale\nabrogation of the rights of third parties is perhaps the most egregious aspect\nof the court's receivership orders. Cf. Spence, 382 Mass. at 418 (rights of\nthird parties \"should not be swept away simply because the [party placed in\nreceivership] has mismanaged its affairs\").\n\n159\n, The Trial Court's Overly Broad Injunctive\nOrders Fail to Conform to the Requirements\nof Mass.

[and] describe\nin reasonable detail.., the act or acts sought to be restrained.\" The trial\ncourt's injunctive orders fall far short of meeting these requirements.\nParticularly problematic in this regard are the orders that enjoin DMWs\nattorneys from \"seek[ing] to accomplish through the Individual Guardianship\nproceedings what they are enjoined from doing herein\" and from filing\n\"groundless and multiple pleadings\" in those proceedings. App. 1342. These\norders fail to specify what particular actions DMR's attorneys are enjoined\nfrom taking. This lack of specificity, combined with the court's threat of\nsanctions, App. 1342, and its referral of its findings to the Board of Bar\nOverseers, App. 1293, can serve only to chill any actions by DMR's\nattorneys, or by the court-appointed lawyers for the individual students, to\nvigorously represent the interests of their clients in those proceedings. See\nCommonwealth v. Segal, 401 Mass. 95, 98 (1987) (\"[c]ontempt or the threat\nof contempt should not be used to chill an attorney's vigorous but respectful\nadvocacy\").\nIn addition, given the broad-ranging duties delegated to the receiver by\nthe court's receivership orders (which are themselves highly problematic, as\nshov_ above), the orders enjoining DMR employees or agents and anyone\nacting in concert with them from \"tak[ing] any action to obstruct, frustrate,\nor interfere with the Receiver in the performance of his duties\" and from\n\"aid[ing], counseling or soliciting any other person to take any such action,\"\nApp. 1348, similarly fail to specify or describe in reasonable detail what\nparticular actions are prohibited. Virtually any action or advice pertaining to\nBRI could well be deemed to fall within this prohibition.\n\n160\n4. Because It Is Likely that the Trial Court's\nReceivership and Injunctive Orders Will Be\nVacated by this Court, and Because of the\nSerious Risk of Irreparable Harm to the\nCommonwealth and the Public in the\nInterim, These Orders Should Be Stayed\nPending This Court's Decision on the Merits\nof This Appeal\nFor the reasons just discussed, in addition to the arguments on the merits\nof the trial court's contempt judgment made in the earlier sections of this\nbrief, the extraordinary injunctive and receivership relief granted by the trial\ncourt should ultimately be vacated by this Court. Hov,'ever, as this Court has\nrepeatedly recognized, \"[A receivership] decree can often have irreversible\nand far-reaching consequences\" that cannot be remedied even by an appellate\ncourt's eventual ruling in defendant's favor. Lopez, 384 Mass. at 169; George\nAirman, Inc., 366 Mass. at 179. It is therefore appropriate, in the interests of\njustice, that these orders be stayed pending this Court's decision on the merits\nof this appeal .230\na. Absent a stay of the extraordinary\nrelief granted by the trial court, DMR\nand the public will be irreparably\nharmed.\nThe extraordinary relief granted by the trial court, if not stayed pending\nresolution of this appeal, will have the increasingly irreparable effect of\ndepriving DMR--the state agency charged with protecting the health, safety,\nand dignity of the Commonwealth's mentally retarded citizens--of any\n23°1nitsorderdenying the Commissioner's previousmotion forastay pending appeal,\nthis Court expressly permitted the Commissioner torenew his request inthe present brief.\nApp. 1471-72.\n\n161\nregulator)a'uthorityoverBR1,aproviderofthemosthighlyintrusiveforms\nofbehaviormodificationtreatmenptermittedbystatelaw.\nUnderthetrialcourt'sorders,\"DMR'spowers,asthe)'relatetoBRI,its\nstudentsandfamilies,[are]totallysupersedebdytheReceiver.\"App.1342.\nThus,absenta stay,DMR will be powerlessto ensurethat aversive\nproceduresare usedonly \"as a last resort\" and \"only to address\nextraordinarilydifficult or dangerousbehavioralproblems.., thathave\nseriouslyharmedorarelikelytoseriouslyharmtheindividualorothers','23'\nasrequiredbyDMRregulations.104C.M.R.§§20.15(1)(ca)nd20.15(4)(b).\nNorwill DMRbeabletoinvestigateallegationsofabuseorneglectofBRI\nstudentsa,s required by G.L.c. 19C and 104 C.M.R. §§ 24.01 et seq. Given\nthe court's findings of over-regulation and over-investigation by DMR, F.\n271-85, App. 1277-80, it is obviously the court's intention that the receiver\ncarD' out these crucial responsibilities in a less vigilant manner. Any harm\nsuffered by BRrs clients in the absence of strict oversight and thorough\ninvestigation may well be tragically irreparable. App. 1428-29.\nFurthermore, despite the language limiting the receiver's powers-to\nDMR's relations with BRI, App. 1342, the potential effect of the court's\norders on DMR's operations is far more sweeping. The receiver is directed\nto ensure that \"anti-[BRl] bias is eliminated,\" App. 1344, and, to that end, is\nempowered to reorganize the entire structure of DMR and to discipline or fire\nall employees. App. 1346. The receiver is also empowered to \"disaffirm\"\nany contracts previously entered into by DMR. App. 1346. Thus, these\norders affect not only the individual who has been found to be in contempt\n2JtNo such protection isorcould be provided bythe Probate Court,which approves\nindividualtreatment plansperiodicany buthas noday-to-dayoversightastohow those plans\nare actually implemented by BKI. Moreover, the Probate Court's\"approval\" is limited to\na determination of whether the ward, if competent, would consent to the treatments\ncontainedinhisorhertreatment plan. Thisprocedureprovidesnooversight whatsoever of\nthe overalloperationsof the facility. Nor canthe courtmonitorperformthis function,since,\nasdiscussedabove,hispowersunderthe SettlementAgreementexpresslyexclude the power\ntooversee BILl'scompliance withbehavior modification regulations. See Arguments I.A-\nI.C,supra.\n\n162\nbut also a broad range of innocent third parties, including all DMR\nemployees, unions, and vendors and the public they serve.\nNor is the effect of the court's orders limited to DMR and its employees\nand vendors. Rather, insofar as the receiver will oversee all abuse\ninvestigations concerning BRI's students, he will also supplant the authority\nof the Disabled Persons Protection Commission, a state agency that shares\nthis responsibility with DMR under G.L.c. 19C. The operations of other\nstate agencies--including the Executive Office of Health and Human\nSen'ices, the Department of Education, the Civil Service Commission, the\nDivision of Purchased Services, the Attorney General's Office, and the\nDepartment of Personnel Administratiorv--who each act \"jointly or in concert\n_4th\" DMR fi,_ various purposes, are also constrained by these orders. App.\n1348.\nThe potential interference with the statutory missions of these various\nstate agencies and officials and, more important, the harm that may be\nsuffered by the particularly vulnerable individuals served by BRI, is\nexacerbated by the fact that the order further deprives those who may be\nharmed by the receiver's action (or inaction) of any legal recourse. App.\n1349-50. Thus, in the absence of a stay, any third parties adversely affected\nby the receiver's actions will have no remedy, at least until the court's orders\nare vacated, which may be too late to adequately prevent or repair the injuries\nthey have suffered in the interim.\nb. Neither BRI nor its students would be\nimmediately or irreparably harmed if\nthe relief granted by the trial court is\nstayed.\nAs discussed in Arguments III.B.21 and IV.A.I, supra, the trial court's\nfindings and the underlying evidence fall to establish the requisite risk to the\npublic health or safety or to the financial stability of BRl that would warrant\nthe drastic remedy of placing DMR in receivership. Afortiori, no emergency\n\n163\nwarrants the continuing imposition of this remedy pending resolution of this\nappeal.\nNothing in the court's findings or in the underlying evidence indicates\nthat this drastic relief is necessary in order to protect BRI or its clients from\nany present risk of concrete, immediate, and irreparable harm. Rather, the\nharm to BRI found by the court is primarily economic, F. 286-90, 299-303;\nApp. 1281-82, 1285-86, and will be amply remedied if the court's generous\nattorney's fee award, App. 1341, is upheld on appeal. But see Argument\nIV.B, infra. There is no indication that any indirect effect ofthis financial\nharm on BRI's students is serious enough to warrant the continuation of this\nreceivership pending resolution of this appeal. Rather, even the court's own\nfindings (which, as shown in Argument llI.B.21, supra, are clearly erroneous\ninany event), indicate that the adverse effect of DMR's regulator), activity on\nstudents is primarily limited to a decrease in the amount of time that staffcan\ndevote to individual students and a reduction in the availability of special\nrewards, such as field trips. F. 291-95, App. 1283-84. Other than a finding\nthat one individual received more treatments with other aversives at_er being\ntaken offofthe specialized food program, F. 298, App. 1284-85, which is\ncontradicted by that student's own court-appointed attorney, App..1363, and\nBRI's own reports of that student's progress, App. 1363, there is no finding\nthat any student has suffered, or is likely to suffer, any serious or irreparable\nharm absent the continuing imposition of the drastic relief ordered by the trial\ncourt. Moreover, any harm that may be suffered by BRI pending a decision\nby this Court is far outweighed by the continuing risk of more serious harm\nto DMR and the public in the absence of a stay.\n\n164\nB. The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion and Erred\nas a Matter of Law in Awarding over $1 Million in\nAttorneys _Fees. 232\nIi The Trial Court Abased Its Discretion by\nFailing to Scrutinize the Reasonableness of\nthe Hours Expended or the Expenses\nIncurred and by Failing to Explain the\nAmount of Its Award so as to Permit\nMeaningful Appellate Review.\nIn awarding a total of $1,098,087.50 in attorneys' fees and expenses, the\ntrial court compensated a total of 25 attorneys and paralegals for ever),\nminute of timC 33and every penny of expenses actually spent, without any\ndetermination as to the reasonableness of the amount of time spent by\nparticular attorneys on particular tasks or of the $71,017.34 of expenses they\nincurred, and without permitti:ig DMR to review the underlying billing\nrecords so as to contest these issues. This gross abuse of the court's\ndiscretion warrants vacating tiffs award in its entirety, even if the underlying\ncontempt judgment is upheld.\n2321tisdoubtful whether any award of attumey's fees against astate official in his official\ncapacity as asanction forcivil contempt ispermissible without anexprress statutory waiver\nof sovereign immunity. M.C v. Comrniss/oner of Correction, 399 Mass. 909, 913 (1987);\nBroadhurst v. Director, Divisinn of Employment Security, 373 Mass. 720, 0977). Cf\nCommonwealth v. One 1987 FordEconoline Van, 413 Mass. 407, 414 (1992) (upholding\naward of fees against the \"Commonwealth,\" viz., the District Attorney, as a contempt\nsanction, without any discussion of sovereign immunity, which was waived by the\nCommonwealth in bringing that aff'wmative case); see In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 411\nMass. 489, 502 n. 14(1992).\n233While the fees awarded to 23 of the attorneys and paralegals were based on the time\nspent multiplied by various hourly rates, Kenneth Kumos and Charles Krat_enmaker were\nawarded a flat fee of $5,000, the precise amount that they charged their clients for their\nservices. App 1321.\n\n165\nAlthough trial courts have broad discretion in determining the amount of\ncourt-awarded attorney's fees, that discretion is not unlimited. As aptly stated\nby one appellate court, \"The court's role as the guarantor of faimess obligates\nit not to accept uncritically what lawyers self-servingly suggest is reasonablc\ncompensation for their services.\" Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa\nCorp., 925 F.2d 518, 525 (lst Cir. 1991). Rather, \"the judge must exercise\nthe discretion granted\" (emphasis added), to ensure that the amount awarded\nis in fact \"reasonable.\" Stratos v. Department of Public Welfare, 387 Mass.\n312,324 (1982); TM see also Coyne Industrial Laundry of Schenectad); Inc.\nv. Gould, 359 Mass. 269, 277-78 (1971) (applying \"strictly conservative\nprinciples\" to reduce the amount of fees awarded by the trial court as a\ncontempt sanction).\n\"The [trial] court should not only exercise its discretion but do so\ndemonstrably,\" Scarfo v. Cabletron Systems, Inc., 54 F.3d 931,964 (lst Cir.\n1995), by \"provid[ing] a concise but clear explanation of the reasons for the\nfee award.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983); accord Rapp\nv. Barry, 398 Mass. 1004, 1005 (1986); Strand v. Herrick & Smith, 396\nMass. 783,789 (1986); Tortes v.Attorney General, 391 Mass. 1, 16 (1984).\nIn particular, the trial court must make specific findings as to the\nreasonableness of the time spent by particular attorneys on particular tasks,\nStewart v. Gates, 987 F.2d 1450, 1452 (9th Cir. 1993); Kennedy, 400 Mass.\nat 275; and the reasonableness of the particular expenses incurred.\nPalmigiano v. Garrahy, 707 F.2d 636, 637 (lst Cir. 1983). In addition,\nwhere fees are awarded as a sanction for contempt, the court must make\nspecific findings identifying \"those... efforts that were useful and necessary\nto ensure compliance with the court's orders and those that were not,\"\n2rtAIthough many oftheattorney'sfees cases cited hereinweredecided under the federal\nCivil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the same standards and\nmethodology are applied byboth federal and state courts in awarding fees as a sanction for\ncivil contempt. See, e.g., Halderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital, 49 F.3d 939,\n941 (3rd Cir. 1995); Ranco Industrial Products Corp. v.Dunlap, 776 F.2d I135, 1140 (3rd\nCir. 1985); Burke v.

Pa. 1982), affd in part, remanded in\npart, 49 F.3d 939 (3rd Cir. 1995); Arch Medical Associates, 32 Mass. App.\nCt. at 409. In the absence of such findings, there can be no meaningful\nappellate review of the trial court's award. Bell v. United Princeton\nProperties, Inc., 884 F.2d 713, 723 (3rd Cir. 1989); Ranco Industrial\nProducts Corp. v. Dunlap, 776 F.2d 1135, 1140 (3rd Cir. 1985); Donnell v.\nUnited States, 682 F.2d 240, 250 (D.C. Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459\nU,S.1204 (1983).\nIn this case, the trial court's sole finding of fact relating to attorney's fees\nis the following conclusory statement: \"Total legal fees incurred by BRI, the\nparents and the class of students as a result of this litigation, which were\nnecessary and reasonable in response to the wrongful conduct of DMR, are\n$1,098,087.50. ''23s In its Conclusions of Law, the court further states as\nfollows:\nThe amount sought by the Parties as reimbursement for the\nattorneys' fees they have been forced to expend as a result of\nthe defendant's conduct over the last two years is fair and\nreasormble. The Court makes this finding, incorporating the\nAffidavits of the above mentioned parties based on the\nattorneys' years at the bar, standing in the legal community,\nthe caliber of their work in this case, the difficulty of the\nmatter, and the fact that there was minimal duplication of\neffort.\nWith respect to the last factor, the court further \"notes that it was reasonable\nat trial for three attorneys from IBRI] to be involved. DMR was represented\nat trial by three attorneys.\" More generally, the court further \"finds that the\nenormous expenditure of legal resources by DMR in its contemptuous attack\non [BRI] more than justifies the legal commitment IBRI] was obliged to\nmake to repel those efforts.\"\n235Asindicated in.the Appendix to the trial court's conclusions of law, the total amount\nof the fee award is simply the sum total of the hours claimed by each of the applicants\n(multiplied by various hourly rates) plus the amount of expenses actually incurred, according\nto their affidavits.\n\n167\nThese conclusory statements, which are based almost verbatim on BRI's\nproposed conclusions of law,23_App. 1028-29, fall far short of providing the\nkind of reasoned analysis that is necessary to permit meaningful appellate\nreview. \"Conclusory statements concerning reasonableness are insufficient\nto withstand appellate review.\" Grendel's Den v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 950\n(lst Cir. 1984) (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 439 n. 15). As this Court\nrecognized in one of its leading cases on the calculation of attorney's fees,\nsimply listing the relevant factors does not \"lead with any certainty to a\nnumber of dollars.\" Stratos, 387 Mass. at 322. In particular, while the\namount of time actually spent is an appropriate starting point for the court's\ncalculation of a reasonable fee, the court must go on to make findings as to\nthe reasonableness of spending particular amounts of time on particular tasks.\nSociety of Jesus of New England v. Boston Landmarks Comm., 411 Mass.\n754, 760 (1992); King v. Greenblatt, 560 F.2d 1024, 1027 (lst Cir. 1977)\n('\"an attorney's record of time is not a talisman'; the [trial] court should\nscrutinize it with care\"), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916 (1978). Nor is the fmding\nthat DMR expended substantial legal resources in regulating BRI sufficient,\nin itself, to justify the reasonableness of every minute spent by each of the 25\nattorneys and paralegals who worked on this case on behalf of BRI, the\nparents, and the students. Cf. Olmstead v. Murphy, 21 Mass. App. Ct. at 668\n(concluding that \"more effort was expended.., than the difficulty of the case\nwarranted, notwithstanding the particular obstacles erected by the\ndefendants\").\nRemarkably absent from the court's findings and conclusions are any\nfindings whatsoever on the following essential points:\n236AsdiscussedinsectionIll.A, supra, this,initself, castssubstantial doubton whether\nthetrialcourtexerciseditsindependent judgmentincalculatingand explainingitsfee award.\nLewisv.Emerson, 391 Mass. at524, 526. Although the courtrequested and obtained the\nanomeys' billing records priortomakingthese findings,App. 1201,the court'sfindings and\nconclusionscontainnoinformation that isnot containedinthe applicants' affidavits and in\nBRI's proposed findings and conclusions, which were submined prior tothe underlying\nbilling records.\n\n168\n(1) why it was reasonable for BKI to staffthis case with 18 lawyers and\nparalegals during the two-year period covered by its fee request, App. 621 -\n22, see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434;\n(2) why it was reasonable to compensate attorneys, including several\nfirst-year asso_:iates, at rates ranging from $125 to $175 per hour, App. 1321,\nfor ever3' hour of time spent, including time spent on routine tasks (such as\ndrafting correspondence and deposition notices, drafting public records\nrequests, preparing fee affidavits, and preparing exhibit binders) and nonlegal\ntasks (such as rewriting treatment plans; providing factual information to\nDMR, attending Human Rights Committee meetings, and preparing for\npsychiatric evaluations), App. 572-87, 1188-90. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n434; Stratos, 387 Mass. at 323; Pennhurst, 49 F.3d at 942;\n(3) why it was reasonably necessary for BRI's lawyers to aggressively\noppose virtually every regulatory action taken by DMR over the last two\nyears, rather than simply comply with such actions or pursue less expensive\nremedies, including administrative appeals, which BRI neglected to do; and\n(4) why itwas reasonably necessary for counsel to incur expenses totaling\n$71,017.34, including $13,057.09 for outside photocopying alone. App.\n1194-95. See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 957; Loper v. NYC Police Dep't,\n853 F. Supp. 716, 723-24 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).\nThe trial court's failure to make findings on these issues may be due, in\nlarge part, to the applicants' failure to satisfy their burden of demonstrating\nthe reasonableness of the amounts sought. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433;\nSociety of Jesus, 411 Mass. at 759. In particular, the burden is on the fee\napplicants \"to produce satisfactory evidence--in addition to the attorney[s']\nown affidavits\"---of the reasonableness of the amounts sought, Blum v.\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896 n. 11 (! 984); Society of Jesus, 411 Mass. at 759\nn. 11; to demonstrate that they exercised \"billing judgment\" \"in excluding\nfrom a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise\nunnecessary,\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434; and to justify their expenses.\nGrendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 957. In a contempt case, the fee applicants have\nthe additional burden of establishing a causal connection between the amount\nof their fee requests and the defendant's disobedience of a court order. Arch\n\n169\nMedical Associates, 32 Mass. App. Ct. at 409. Because the applicants\nproduced no evidence on these points, as to which the)' had the burden of\nproof, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to deny, or at least\nsubstantially reduce, their fee award on this basis.\n2. The Trial Court Erred in Awarding Fees\nWithout Giving the Commissioner an\nOpportunity to Revieh_ and Respond to the\nFee Applicants' Contemporaneous Time\nRecords, Which Were Submitted In Camera\nand Impounded by the Court\nIn support of their respective applications for attorney's fees, counsel\nsubmitted affidavits describing their background, experience, and billing rates\nand generally describing the various kinds of work performed in this case.\nApp. 563-627, 1176-1200. The affidavits did not specify which attorney(s)\nperformed particular tasks, the dates on which particular tasks were\nperformed, or the amount of time spent on particular tasks; nor did the\naffiants provide any contemporaneous time records containing such\ninformation. 2_7The expenses claimed were similarly un-itemized, except in\ngeneral categories, and unsupported by any invoices or receipts.\nBecause these affidavits were patently insufficient to support an\napplication for court-awarded attorney's fees, e.g., Tennessee Gas Pipeline\nCo. v. 104 Acres of Land, 32 F.3d 632, 634 (lst Cir. 1994); Stewart, 987 F.2d\nat 1453; Ramos v. Lamm, 713 F.2d 546, 553 (10th Cir. 1983); National\nAssoc. of Concerned Veterans v.Sect, of Defense, 675 F.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C.\nCir. 1982); Arch Medical Associates, 32 Mass. App. Ct. at 409, the\nCommissioner argued that the fee applications should be denied for failure\n237PaulCataldo, one of the two attorneys for\"the studentmembers of the class,\"did\nattach his billing records to the affidavit thathe filedwith the courtand served on other\nparties including the Commissioner. App. t131-34. Whi|e Mr. Cataldo's €o-€ounsel,\nMichele Dorsey, states inher affidavitthat her billing records are attached, App. 1174. no\ncopies of the attachments were. infact, served on the Commissioner.\n\n170\nto provide such supporting documentation. App. 737-38. DMR's Proposed\nC. 49. Perhaps in response to the Commissioner's proposal, the court\nsubsequently issued an order requiring counsel \"to submit and file in camera\ntheir respective existing unredacted legal bills that underly [sic] their\nAffidavits heretofore submitted on this issue.\" App. 1201. As grounds for\nthis order, the court stated, \"This Court finds that such in camera review is\nnecessary and appropriate in order to inspect and consider the confidential\nbilling information under the circumstances of this litigation where attorney-\nclient privilege applies.\" ld\nThe Commissioner objected to such in camera review on the grounds that\nsuch information is not privileged and that, without access to this\ninformation, he was severely prejudiced in his ability to contest the\nreasonableness of the amount of fees sought? 3s After issuing a judgment and\norder awarding counsel fees for every hour of time spent on this case, the\ncourt ordered, sua sponte, that the supporting documentation be impounded,\nso that, to date, the Commissioner still has had no opportunity to review\ncounsel's time records and to object, on that basis, to the reasonableness of\nthe time spent? 39\nWhere a party seeks to have its fees paid by an opposing party, courts\nuniformly require the fee applicant to provide the underlying\ncontemporaneous billing records or other suitable\ndocumentation--specifying precisely how much time was spent by particular\nattorneys, on particular tasks, on particular dates--not only to the court but\nalso to the opposing party. E.g., Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433; In re Kunstler,\n914 F.2d 505, 524 (4th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 969 (1991);\nConcerned Veterans, 675 F.2d at 1327; cf. Hand), v.

Stewart _: Gates, 987 F.2d at 1452; Bell, 884 F.2d at 720;\nDonnell v. United States, 682 F.2d at 247. And, as several courts have\nrecognized, the opposing party's active and informed participation in the\nprocess of determining a reasonable fee is necessary to ensure that the fee\nawarded is not arbitrary or based solely on the self-serving affidavits of the\nfee applicant but, rather, is the result of a fair adversary process. Scarfo, 54\nF.3d at 965 ; Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950; Stewart, 987 F.2d at 1452; Bell,\n884 F,2d at 719; Concerned Veterans, 675 F.2d at 1327.\nIn the few cases where attorney-client privilege has been raised as a bar\nto providing billing records for purposes of determining the reasonableness\nof an attorney's fees, such claims have been rejected, either on ll_e basis that\ninformation contained _ such lecords is not a communication subject to the\nprivilege, Stastny v. Southern Bell TeL & TeL Co., 77 F.R.D. 662, 663\n(W.D.N.C. 1978); Blowers v. Lawyers Co-op Publishing Co., 526 F. Supp.\n1324 (W.D.N.Y. 1981), or because arty claim of privilege is \"undoubtedly\"\nwaived by the filing of a fee application. Mary Frances Definer & Arthur D.\nWolfe, Court Awarded Attorney's Fees I 18.0612][d] (1995 ed.). These\nholdings are in accordance with the general rule that attorneys' billing records\nand hourly statements are not privileged. FSLIC v Ferm, 909 F.2d 372,373\n(9tll Cir. 1990); Tornay v. United States, 840 F.2d 1424, 1426, 1428 (9th Cir.\n\n172\n1988);FTCv. Cambridge Exchange, Ltd., 845 F. Supp. 872,874 (S.D. Fla.\n1993); North Carolina Elec. Membership Corp. v.

Richard Larson, Federal\nCourt A wards of Attorney's Fees, 274 n. 19 (I 981 ).\nIn directing the applica,lts to provide the documentation for their fee\nclaims only to the court and then impounding that information, sua sponte,\nthe trial court provided no explanation as to why all of the information\ncontained in the applicants' billing records is privileged, contrary to the\ngeneral rule discussed abovefl ° Nor did the court follow the procedures\nmandated by the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure, Trial Court\nRule VIII--including notice, hearing, and written findings--prior to\nimpounding these documents. Moreover, even if there is some information\ncontained in the billing records of counsel for BRI or for the parents that is\nprivileged and is not essential to a determination of their claims for fees, that\ninformation alone should have been redacted and the remaining records\nshould have been disclosed to the Commissioner, either by the fee applicants\nthemselves or by the court alter its in camera review. To award every penny\nof the more than $1 million claimed by these attorneys without permitling the\nstate agency that is charged with paying this extraordinary sum, any access\nto the underlying basis for these claims, in itself warrants vacation of the fee\naward to these applicants in its entirety.\n24°_his extraordinarily broad and unexplained application of the aUomey-client\nprivilege toallof BRrs billing recordsover the course of the last two years standsinstark\ncontrast to the court's ruling that the privilege does not apply to the only two items,\ncomprisinglessthan one page ofa single document, as towhich DMR claimed the attorney-\nclient privilege. App. 1305-08; see Argument III.B.I 3.c,supra.\n\n173\nThe Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in\ng\nFailing to Reduce Its Award to Account for\nCertain Patently Unreasonable Expenditures\nof Time and Money.\nEven based on the limited information available to the Commissioner and\nto this Court, certain amounts claimed by the applicants and awarded by the\ntrial court should be vacated as abuses of the trial court's discretion to award\na \"reasonable\" fee.\nThe Trial Court Abused Its Discretion\na.\nin Awarding More fo.an $200,000 to\nthe Parents and the Students, Given\nTheir Attorneys' Limited Contribution\nto the Contempt Proceedings.\nIn addition to awarding $896,795.61 to BRI's 18attorneys and paralegals,\nApp. 661-62, the court also awarded $201,291.98 to 7 attorneys for the\nparents, TM App. 1148-52, 1176-85, and the students. 242App. 1131-47, 1173-\n2_It is not clear from the record precisely whom Eugene Curry, Allen Larson,\nChristopherFiset,Kenneth Kumos,andCharlesKrattem-nakerrepresentinthiscase. Intheir\nrespective fee affidavits, Mr. Cut'o]identifies himself, Mr. Larson, Mr. Fiset, and Mr.\nKurnos as \"counsel tothe plaintiff class of students at the Judge Rotenberg Educational\nCenter,their parentsand guardians,\" App.623; while Mr.Kumosidentifieshimself andMr.\nKrattenmaker as \"counsel tothe parents and guardiansof the plaintiffclass of students.\"\nApp. 1148-49. Earlier court filings were signed by Mr. Can')'as attorney for\"'l'he BRI\nParents and Friends Association, Inc.,\" anorganization comprisingsome but not all ofthe\nparents of BRl students. However, since May 18, 1995,when the trial courtstated (in its\nmemorandum and order denying the individual students'motion tointervene) that\"the entire\nClass [consisting of allStudentsat BRI, their Parentsand Guardians] is... represented by\nMr.Curry,\"he has been signing courtpapersas atlomey forthat entireclass. E.g., App.\n1130.\n2_-_Theri¢salso someconfusionas towhom PaulCataldo andMichele Dorsey represent.\n(continued...)\n\n174\n75. This amount is clearly excessive, given the limited role played by these\nattorneys in the contempt proceedings.\nBecause neither the parents nor the students were parties to the contempt\nproceedings, 243the trial court would have been justified in declining to award\nan)' fees to their attorneys on that ground. See Morales v. Turman, 820 F.2d\n728, 731-32 (5th Cir. 1987) (denying fees to counsel for non-party even\nthough they were appointed by the court and rendered services benefcial to\nplaintiff class). A more moderate approach, often taken with respect to\nintervenors, is to base a determination of fee eligibility on the role their\ncounsel played in the litigation. E.g., Grove v. Mead School District No. 354,\n753 F.2d 1528, 1535 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 826 0985) (\"Awards\nto intervenors should not be granted unless the intervenor plays a significant\nrole in the litigation.\"); Donnell v. United States, 682 F.2d at 247-48 (same).\n\"Even if the [trial] court finds that intervenors' participation in the case was\nimportant and substantial, there yet remains the question whether this\nparticipation needed to be so extensive given the central role played by [other\nattorneys with similar interests].\" Id. at 250. Where fees are awarded to\nseveral attorneys whose clients have similar interests, the amount awarded\nshould be reduced to account for any unnecessary duplication of effort.\nPennhurst, 49 F.3d at 943; cf Society of Jesus, 411 Mass. at 759-61\n(reducing amount of fees where several attorneys for same party requested\n_42(...continued)\nThetrialcourtappointedthem tosucceed at_rneys Marc PerlinandMaxVolterra, who had\nsignedtheSettlementAgreementonbehalf of\"BRl clients,\"App. 133, notonbehalf of the\n\"Classof AllStudentsatBRI,Their Parentsand Guardians,\"which wasrepresentedatthat\ntimebyRobertSherman,App. 133,nowoneofBRrs counsel. App. 563. InappointingMr.\nCataldoandMs.Dorsey, the courtindicated that they were beingappointedas \"counsel to\nthe class of students,\"App. 132,althoughno suchsubclass has everbeen certified by the\ncourt. See PriorProceedings, subsection 2, supra. Ina subsequent order, denying the\nindividual students'motionto intervene,the a'ialcourtindicated thatMr.Cataldo and Ms.\nDorsey represent \"the student members of the Class.\" Mr. Cataldo and Ms. Dorsey\nthemselves apparently share in thisconfusion, since, in their fee affidavits, Mr.Cataldo\nidentifies himself as counsel for the \"class of students,\" App. 1132, while Ms. Dorsey\nidentifiesherself ascounsel forthe \"student members of the Class.\" App. 1173.\nZ43SeePrior Proceedings, subsection 8,supra.\n\n175\nfees for preparing and appearing at oral argument but only one attorney\nargued).\nUnder these standards, the fees awarded to counsel for the parents and\nstudents should be substantially reduced if not entirely disallowed. TM Ms.\nDorsey and Mr. Cataldo called no witnesses and introduced no exhibits at\ntrial. Mr. Curry introduced one exhibit and called four witnesses, all of\nwhom were also on BKI's and/or DMR's lists of potential witnesses; the\ncombined testimony of those four witnesses consumed less than a half-day\nof the 13-day trial. Mr. Fiset was silent throughout the trial. Counsel for the\nparents and for the students each submitted proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law, App.1086-1130, neither of which added anything\nsubstantial to the voluminous proposed findings and conclusions submitted\nby BRJ. It does not appear that the trial court adopted any of the parents' or\nstudents' proposed findings as written.\nGiven the very limited role played by these attorneys, the court abused its\ndiscretion in requiring tile defendant to compensate them at the rate of $125\nor $150 for more than 1,000 hours, largely spent sitting silently at counsel\ntable or at depositions or draining documents that added little or nothing of\nsubstance to those submitted by BRI. Like other fee applicants who were\ndenied fees in similar circumstances, these attorneys \"'merely caught hold of\na train on its way out of the station and are seeking to ride it to substantial\naward of attorney's fees. [They] played no part in fning the boiler, getting up\na head of steam, or opening the throttle. [They]just went along for the ride.'\"\nDonnell, 682 F.2d at 247 (quoting Bush v. Bays, 463 F. Supp. 59, 66 (E.D.\nVa. 1978)); see also Pennhurst, 49 F.3d at 943-44 (reducing by 50% fees\nawarded for time spent by additional attorney with similar interest attending\ndepositions and drafting proposed findings).\n2UThe fees awarded toMs. Dorsey andMr. Cataldoshould bedisallowed for another\nreason aswell. Ascourt.appointedcounsel, App. 211, I132, I173,these attorneys are paid\nb)' the state rather than by their clients. Therefore, no award of fees is necessary to\ncompensate their clients for the cost of vindicating their rights under the Settlement\nAgreement, the only legitimate reason for awarding attorneys' fees ina contempt action.\nArch MedicalAssoc., 32 Mass App. Ct. at409; Burke v.

Treen, 700 F. Supp. 1422, 1433 (E.D. La. 1988) (where several\nattorneys billed for time at trial, court allowed fees only for those who took\na leading role on that day).\nb. The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion\nin Compensating Counsel for Certain\nNoncompensable Activities.\nEven based on the limited information contained in the applicants' fee\naffidavits, certain activities for which they sought and received compensation\nstand out as clearly noncompensable. Many of the activities listed in BRI's\nfee affidavits--such as responding to DMR's requests for information,\ncomplying with certification conditions, responding to abuse investigations,\ndrafting letters to BRrs out-of-state funding agencies, making public records\nrequests (and related expenses), and attending to BRI's fiscal matters, App.\n574-87--were not undertaken in the contempt litigation itself and therefore\nshould not have been included in BRI's application, much less in the court's\naward. As is clear from BRI's own fee affidavits, BRI's counsel kept separate\nrecords for time spent on \"litigation\" and time spent on other noniitigation\nactivities including \"certification. ''2'_ App. 1194-95. Only time related to the\ncontempt litigation itself is properly chargeable to the opposing party in that\n24SAIthoughthe court found itwas reasonable forBRItobe represented attrial by three\nattorneys, App. 1315, itmade no atlempt to explain why itwas reasonable to have four\nadditional attorneys present torepresent the parents and children.\n246Although, as discussed above, those records were not made available to the\nCommissioner,\n\n177\nlitigation? _7 Pennhurst, 855 F.

Time spent\nresponding to media inquiries is also noncompensable, Pennhurst, 49 F.3d\nat 942; In re Kunstler, 914 F.2d at 523; Auburn Police Union v. Tierney, 762\nF. Supp. 3, 4-5 (D. Me. 1991), as is time spent on appellate litigation, absent\nexpress authorization by the appellate court. Mellor v. Berman, 390 Mass.\n275, 284 (1983).\nIf this case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on\nattorneys' fees or for any other purpose, the Court should direct that it be\nassigned to a Superior Court judge in accord with the ordinary assignment\nprocess in the Superior Court.\n247TimespentbyBRI's attorneys onregulatory matters,notrelated tolitigation against\nthe Commonwealth, isalreadypaid forby Massachusetts and otherstates as acomponent\nof BRI's state-approved tuition rate. Ex. BRI-267. Requiring the Commonwealth topay\ntwice for suchservices would be particularlyunreasonable. Moreover, although DPS has\ntaken the position that time spent suing the Commonwealth isnot reimbursable, id, BRI's\npresent rateapparently does notreflectthis exclusion. Id Therefore, anyfees awarded to\nBRIinthiscase willbeinaddition tothe amounts included inBRI'stuition ratefor the same\npurpose.\n\n178\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the above reasons, this Court should reverse the contempt\njudgment and vacate the relief granted by the trial court. Pending this Court's\ndecision in this appeal, the Court should stay the trial court's receivership and\ninjunctive orders.\nRespectfully submitted,\nSCOTT HARSHBARGER\nATTORNEY GENERAL\nA.

BRI Supp. App. 151.1 Despite this order,\nin its subsequently filed brief, BRF failed to brief the merits of the issues\nraised in the Commissioner's appeal from the preliminary injunction 3and,\ninstead, persisted in rearguing its already denied motion to dismiss this\nappeal. BRI Br. at 7-8.\nShould the Court decide to revisit the issue of whether to dismiss the\nConunissioner's appeal from the preliminary injunction as moot, the Court\nshould reaffirm its prior decision not to dismiss this appeal and should\nproceed to decide this appeal on the merits. Although final judgment has\nentered in the contempt proceedings, the underlying equity case and the\nindividual guardianship cases involving the students at BRI are still very\n_Yhefollowing abbreviations are used herein to refer to the parties' briefs\nand appendices: \"DMR PI Br.\" (Commissioner's opening brief in SJC-06956),\n\"BRI Br.\" (BRI's brief inSJC-06956), \"App.\" (appendix in SJC-07101), \"PI App.\"\n(appendix in SJC-06956), \"BRI Supp. App.\" (BRI's supplemental appendix),\n\"DMR Supp. App.\" (Commissioner's supplemental appendix in SJC-07045).\n2Because, inmost instances, the arguments made by the class of students\nand parents and the student members of the class are essentially the same as those\nmade by BRI, this brief uses \"BRI\" to refer generally to all appellees, unless\notherwise specified.\n3Having failed to brief the merits of this appeal, BRI has waived its right\nto oral argument on the issues raised in the Commissioner's brief. Mass. R. App.\nP. 19(c).\n-2-\n\nmuchalive. In its judgment and order in the contempt proceedings, in\naddition to the contempt sanctions, the court expressly retained jurisdiction\nover the underlying equity case, App.1351; ordered DMR to comply with the\nterms of the 10-year-old Settlement Agreement, App. 1340; indicated that\norders were \"being entered [that day] in the Guardianship proceedings\nappointing the Honorable George N. Assack (Ret.) as Master to hear\nTreatment Plan Reviews,\" App. 1342 n.1; and ordered DMR's attorneys,\nunder threat of sanctions, not to \"seek to accomplish through the Individual\nGuardianship proceedings what they are enjoined from doing herein.\" App.\n1342.\nAlthough the contempt judgment and order further provided that\n\"[t]he Court's preliminary injunction ... is hereby vacated and superseded\nby this Final Judgment of Contempt,\" App. 1342, it is unclear what effect, if\nany, that provision has on BRI's current right to use Level III aversives in\ngeneral and the specialized food program in particular. Since the preliminary\ninjunction principally enjoined the Commissioner from enforcing his decision\nof March 23, 1995, decertfying BRI to use any Level III aversives (with the\nproviso that, during the term of the preliminary injunction, BRI comply with\nthe conditions contained in the Commissioner's certification letter of Jantmry\n20, 1995), PI App. at 505, vacation of the preliminary injunction technically\nmeans that the Commissioner is no longer enjoined from decertifying BRI.\nHowever, since the same order also transferred all of the Commissioner's\nregulatory authority over BRI to a court-appointed receiver, App. 1342, the\nCommissioner himself remains powerless to decertify BRI as long as the\nreceivership orders remain in effect.\nNowhere in its contempt judgment and order does the trial court\neither vacate the Commissioner's decision of January 20, 1995, which\nrequired BRI to stop using the specialized food program, or directly require\nor prohibit BRI from using that program. Therelbre, the propriety of such\n-3-\n\norders either by the Commissioner or by the trial court, the central issue in\nthe preliminary injunction appeal, see DMR PI Br. at I-2, 30-42, is not\ndirectly presented by the Commissioner's appeal from the contempt\njudgment.\nWhen the Receiver subsequently exercised his authority, under the\ncontempt judgmem and order, to review and affirm, modify, or rescind all of\nthe Conmfissioner's previous certification decisions, App. 1343, he renewed\nBRI's certification to use Level I11 aversives through December 31, 1996.\nBRI Supp. App. 78. However, he expressly excluded from this certification\nauthorization to utilize the specialized food program and three other\nprocedures, on the ground that, in his view, the Appeals Court Single\nJustice's orders prohibiting BILl from using these procedures are still in\neffect. BRI Supp. App. at 78, 81.\nAbsent a decision by this Court on the Commissioner's appeal from\nthe preliminar)\" injunction, the issues raised by that appeal--involving the\nrespective authority of DMR and that of the Probate or Superior Court over\nthe treatment of students at BRI and, in particular, whether BRI may continue\nto use the specialized food program--will continue to be actively disputed by\nthe parties in the underlying equity case as well as in the individual\nguardianship cases. These novel and important issues, while directly related\nto those that are raised in the Commissioner's appeal from the contempt\njudgment, are legally and factually distinct and therefore will not be resolved\nby this Court in the Conmfissioner's pending appeal from the contempt\njudgment.\nMoreover, even if the Commissioner's appeal from the trial court's\npreliminary injunction is deemed by this Court to be moot, the appeal should\nnevertheless be decided by this Court in order to provide needed guidance to\nthe p',a-ties and to the trial court--in a discrete, concrete factual context that\nis not as squarely presented by the Commissioner's appeal from the more\n-4-\n\nbroadlysweepingcontempt orders--on these issues of public importance?\nCI Guardianship of tgeedon, 409 Mass. 196, 197 (1991) (deciding moot\nquestion because \"there is a significant public inlerest in clarifying the\nrequirements for review of substituted judgment treatment plans issued by the\nProbate Court\"); Sciaba Constr. Corp. v. Boston, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 181,185\n(1993) (deciding moot appeal from denial of preliminary injunction becetuse\n\"issue is one of public importance and is likely to arise again in similar\nfactual circumstances . . . and a decision will probably prevent further\nlitigation between the parties); Metros v. Secretary, 396 Mass. 156, 159\n(1985) (deciding moot appeal \"because of the public interest involved and the\nuncertainty and confusion that exist\").\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the reasons discussed above and in the Commissioner's\nopening brief, the Court should retain jurisdiction of the Commissioner's\nappeal from the preliminary injunction and reverse the preliminary injunction\nissued by the trial court.\nRespectfully submitted,\nSCOTT }IARSHBARGER\nATTORNEY GENERAL\nJ-_ith S. Yogman q\nAs_;istant Attorney General\nOne Ashburton Place, Room 2019\nBoston, MA 02108-1698\n(617) 727-2200, ext. 2066\nBBO No. 537060\n4Asacknowledged by BRI inconcurring inthe Commissioner's application\nfor direct appellate review in SJC-07045, all of these interrelated appeals raise\nnovel and complex issues of public importance.

Whether the Trial Court abused its discretion by denying the appellant's\nmotion to be appointed, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 17(b), as next friend of the\nStudent members of the Plaintiff class when the interests of those Students was\nalready represented by Court-appointed Guardians and by independent counsel?\n2. Whether the Trial Court abused its discretion by denying the appellant's\nmotion to intervene, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 24, on behalf the Student\nmembers of the Plaintiff Class when Students were already members of the Plaintiff\nclass and the interests of the Student members of the class were already adequately\nrepresented?\n+\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 3, 1993, a verified complaint for contempt was filed on\nbehalf of the Plaintiff, Behavior Research Institute Jand the Class of all Students at\nthe Behavior Research Institute and their Parents and Guardians (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the Class\") against Philip Campbell, Commissioner of the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation (hereinafter referred to as \"the Commissioner\").\nApp. 19.2 The complaint sought to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Settlement Agreement\") which resolved litigation\nbrought by BRi and the Class against Mary Kay Leonard, director of the\nMassachusetts Office for Children. App. 241. The Complaint alleged inter alia\nthat the Commissioner was attempting, in bad faith and in violation of the\nSettlement Agreement, to terminate the BRI program. App.72.\nOn September 15, 1993, attorneys Marc Perlin and Max Volterra, who had\nrepresented the Students members of the Class in the previous litigation and who\nhad negotiated and executed the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Students,\nfiled motions to withdraw as appointed counsel to the Student members of the\nClass. App. 64, 71. The Honorable Elizabeth O'Neill kaStaiti granted their motion\non November 8, 1993 and appointed attorneys C. MicheUe Dorsey and Paul A.\nCataldo to replace Attorneys Perlin and Volterra. App.74.\nThe Appellants (hereinafter referred to as \"the Guardianship Counsel\") are a\ngroup of nine court-appointed attorneys who represent the Students in individual\nsubstituted judgment and guardianship proceedings. App. 137, n.l. On March 31,\n1994, they filed a motion, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 17(b) and G.L.c.201§37,\ntThe Behavior Research Institute subsequently changed its name tothe Judge Rotenberg\nEducational Center. Inc. App. 24l. For purposes of convenience, the initials \"BRI\" will be used\nthroughout the brief to refer tothe Beha'dor Research Institute.\n2\n\ntobe appointed as next friend to the individual Students. App. 137. On the same\nday, claiming to act as the next friend of the Students, the Guardianship Counsel\nfiled a motion to intervene in this contempt action. App. 79.\nAfter a hearing on April 5, 1995, Judge LaStaiti denied both motions on\nMay 18, 1995. App. 241-244.\nOn May 25, 1995, the Guardianship Counsel filed a notice of appeal of the\ndenial of both motions. App. 245. On June 5, 1995, the Guardianship Counsel's\nrequest for r6lief from Judge LaStaiti's ruling was denied by a Single Justice of the\nAppeals Court (Perretta, J.). App. 248-249. On June 21, t995, the Guardianship\nCounsel's request for relief from that order was denied by a Single Justice of this\nCourt (Abrams, J.). App. 250. This Court granted direct appellate review on\nSeptember 10, 1995.\n: References totheAppendix are set forth as\"App. \".

On that date the OFC issued an order\nto show cause why the license of BR! should not be \"suspended, revoked, or\notherwise sanctioned for various violations of O.F.C.'s regulations\". App. 51.\nThe OFC also ordered the abrupt termination of treatment programs, which\nincluded so-called aversive treatments, for six BRI Students. S.A. 2-3 $_i 1, 3.\nThe Students at BRI are \"a select, special-needs class of desperately afflicted\nstudents, many of whom suffer from autism, brain damage, psychosis,\ndevelopmental disability, mental retardation and severe behavioral disorder, and all\nof whom are grievously mentally ill\". S.A, 1. Each Student has a Court-appointed\nGuardian, who is in most cases the Parent of the Student. App. 88-103, 241. As\nresult of the termination of treatment, the six Students regressed into self-abusive\nbehavior that, in some cases, was life threatening. S.A. 2-3 ¶¶ 1, 3.\nThe OFC's actions led to a \"multitude of lawsuits and administrative\nproceedings\" involving the OFC, BRI, the Students and their families. App. 51,3\nCivil litigation was commenced in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court by\nBRI and the families of the students. S.A. 2 ¶¶ 1,3. On April 29, 1986, the\nHonorable Ernest J.

In his order, Judge\nRotenberg held that:\nThe parties are too numerous to proceed individually to\nobtain the preliminary relief which is so desperately\nneeded...;\nThe students were, as a class, threatened with the\ndeprivation of treatment, and are now preliminarily certified\nas a class in order to maintain their treatment.\nThe questions of law and fact, as they directly relate to this\ninterlocutory ruling, are common to students and parents\nalike. Their claims are the same; that is, their desperate need\nfor maintenance of their current status while further action is\ncontemplated and taken.;\nIt is also clear and irrefutable to this Court that the parents\nand/or guardians should be joined preliminarily as members\nof the this class as they speak for their children who cannot\nspeak for themselves; and their concerns are identical, the\npreservation of the lives of these disadvantaged human\nbeings\".\nApp. 42. In his Findings In Support Of Preliminary Injunctive Relief, Judge\nRotenberg found the orders terminating treatment issued by the OFC were based on\nno medical foundation and constituted treatment decisions that played \"Russian\nRoulette\" ,_vith the lives of the Students. S.A. 27, ¶ 82. Judge Rotenberg found\nthat the executive director of the OFC had acted in bad faith during the course of\nlitigation that followed the September 26 orders, ld. at ¶ 84.\nOn December 12, 1986, Judge Rotenberg certified a Plaintiff Class in this\naction consisting of the students at the Behavior Research Institute, their parents\nand guardians. App. 49-50. There was no appeal of the class certification. App.\n243.\nOn the same day, the parties to the proceeding filed a Settlement Agreement\nto resolve the issues outstanding among the parties. App. 51-64. The Settlement\nAgreement was executed on behalf of the Class Of All Students at BRI, Their\n5\n\nParentsandGuardians by Attorney Sherman. App. 64.

In his Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law In Support Of\nApproval Of Settlement Agreement Pursuant To Mass. R. Civ. P. 23(c), Judge\nRotenberg rejected contentions filed on behalf of the families of two students that\nthe Settlement Agreement failed to guarantee that the treatment of the Students\nwould be safe, effective and professionally acceptable and that the substituted\njudgment proceedings were inadequate to secure the rights of the individual\nStudents. App. 67-68, ¶¶ 7, 9.\nIn addition, Judge Rotenberg noted that two class members were\nrepresented by Steven V. Schwartz, Esquire. App. 67, ¶ 5. Judge Rotenberg\nstated, with respect to the objection of Robert Collins, that Attorney Schwartz\n\"failed to inform the Court in his written objections that his client no longer attends\nBRI\", which rendered his objections moot and that in previous hearings, Attumey\nSchwartz had \"filed an appearance on behalf of various organizations that advocated\nthe closure of BRI, a position which differed markedly from that of the current\nobjectors\". App. 68, ¶¶ 10-11. Judge Rotenberg criticized Attorney Schwartz,\nstating that:\nThis Court looks askance at the objections filed at the\neleventh hour in this case which relate primarily to factual\nmatters earlier fully and fairly litigated and determined by\nthis Court. Moreover, the Court questions the role of\ncounsel for the objectors who had earlier propounded a point\nof vie,,,,\"contrary if not directly adverse to the persons whom\nhe now purports to represent.\nApp. 69.\n6\n\nOn September 3, 1993, BRI filed a Complaint for Contempt seeking to\nenforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement. App. 241. The Complaint and\nsubsequent amendments alleged that DMR was acting in bad faith. App. 72.\nOn September 15, 1993, Attorneys Perlin and Volterra filed motions to\nwithdraw as counsel to the Student members of the Class. App.72. Judge LaStaiti\ngranted their motions on November 8, 1993. App. 71-74. Judge LaStaiti stated the\nCourt remained \"acutely aware of the occurrences of bad faith demonstrated by\nagencies and officials of the Commonwealth against BRI, parents, and wards\",\nmaking an explicit reference to Judge Rotenberg's Findings of June 4, 1986. App.\n73-74. Judge LaStaiti found that:\nThis class of individuals who had previously been\nrepresented by Attorneys Perlin and Volterra continue to\nhave a most vital interest in the process and outcome of any\nlitigation that occurs in the above referenced matter, given\nthe vulnerability that the class suffers due to severe\ndevelopmental disabilities and/or mental illness. This court\nmust remain vigilant to ensure that this class is represented\nby counsel who are as independent and objective from the\ninfluence of any state agency.\nApp. 74, ¶ 14(c) (emphasis supplied). Accordingly, the Court appointed Paul A.\nCataldo, Esquire and C. Michelle Dorsey, Esquire to replace Attorneys Perlin and\nVolterra as \"successor counsel to the class of students\". App. 74, ¶ 15. Eugene\nCurry, Esquire filed his notice of appearance on January 6, 1994. S.A. 29-30.\n\nPrior to being represented by Eugene Curry, the interests of the Class were\nrepresented by Kenneth V. Kurnos, Esquire. App. 25, 239. _\nOn January 28, 1994, Attorneys Dorsey and Cataldo filed a motion for\nemergency relief on behalf of the Students. App. 24. The motion, which was\nallowed by the Court, sought an order requiring DMR to provide out-of-state\nfunding agencies with accurate information conceming the status of BRI's\ncertification. App. 154.\nOn March 31, 1994, the Guardianship Counsel filed their motion to be\nappointed as next friend to the Students and to intervene on behalf of the Students.\nApp. 79, 137. After a hearing on April 5, 1995, Judge LaStaiti denied both\nmotions. App. 241-244. In so doing, Judge LaStaiti concluded:\n1. that \"The Students are adequately represented by their\nParents or Guardians as Next Friend.\";\n2. that \"The Students are members of a Plaintiff Class in the\nissue of Contempt before this Court.\";\n3. that \"The Students are represented by separate counsel,\nnamely Attorney Cataldo and Attorney Dorsey, thereby\nprotecting the students from any potential conflict with the\ninterests of the Parents and Guardians, who are also\nmembers of the class.\"; and\n4. that \"Each student has an independent court appointed\ncounsel to represent them in the guardianship and\nsubstituted judgment proceedings, which proceedings are\nnot part of the Contempt Action\".\nApp. 244. With respect to the representation of the Plaintiff Class, Judge LaStaiti\nruled that \"[t]he entire class is adequately represented by Eugene Curry, Esquire\".\nApp. 243.\nAttorney Kurnosisa member of Gaffin & Kranenmaker. App. 239. Attorney Sherman was a\nmember of the same firmatthe time he represented the Class. App. 48.\n\nI. JUDGE LASTAITI PROPERLY EXERCISED HER\nDISCRETION IN DENYING THE MOTION OF THE\nGUARDIANSHIP COUNSEL TO BE APPOINTED AS\nNEXT FRIEND TO THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS.\nAs even the Guardianship Counsel must concede _, the appointment of a\nnext friend is a decision that rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and\nis a decision that will not be disturbed unless there has been an abuse of authority.\nSee N.O.v. Callahan, 110 F.R.D. 637, 648 (D. Mass. 1986) (citations omitted).\nCourts are reluctant to appoint a next friend or guardian where an infant or\nincompetent person is already represented by someone that is considered\nappropriate. Id...__at_.649. This reluctance is entirely consistent with the plain\nlanguage of Rule 17(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, which\ngoverns the appointment of a next friend or guardian ad litem for an infant or\nincompetent person. Rule 17(b) states that:\nWhenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative,\nsuch as a general guardian, conservator, or other like fiduciary,\nthe representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or\nincompetent person, if an infant or incompetent person does not\nhave a duly appointed representative, he may sue by next friend\nor by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad\nlitem for an infant or an incompetent person not othenvise\nrepresented in an action or make such other order as it deems\nproper for the protection of the infant or incompetent\nperson.(emphasis supplied).\nThus, the plain language of Rule 17(b) contemplates that when, as is true in the\ninstant case, an incompetent individual is represented by a guardian, that guardian\nwill represent the incompetent person in litigation.\nThe Parents and Guardians have represented the interests of the Students are\nsince the inception of this litigation over ten years ago. S.A. 2; App. 42. Of\n._ Guardianship Counsel Bnef at41-4..\n9\n\ncourse, the court's inquiry does not end with the determination that an incompetenl\nperson is represented in an action, In the face of an allegation of conflict of interest\nbetween the guardian and the incompetent person, the court has an obligation to\nassure itself that the interests of the ward are properly represented. S__ Adelman.\nOn Behalf Of Addman v. Graves, 747 F.2d 986, 988 (Sth Cir. 1984). In the\ninstant case, Judge LaStaiti has done so and has found that tl, : interests of the\nstudents are adequately represented. Specifically, the Court made the following\nfindings:\n-Each individual student has a Court appointed Guardian, who\nin most cases is aParent.\n-At all times, the Parents are aware of BRi's program and have\ndemonstrated a strong commitment to the welfare and best\ninterests of the Students.\n-Since the Parents and Guardians are already adequately\nrepresented the Students as Next Friend, it would be redundant\nand wasteful to allow an appointment of a second Next Friend\nfor each individual student.\nApp. 241-242. it is significant that the Court made its' finding concerning the\nstrong commitment of the Parents to the welfare and best interests of the Students\non May 18, 1995. App. 244. By that time, Judge LaStaiti had over twenty months\nto observe the nature of the representation of the Students by their Parents and\nGuardians in this proceeding. As is evident from the docket in this proceeding,\nduring this period of time, the Court had ample opportunity to assess the nature of\nthe representation by the Parents and Guardians of the Students. App. 19-38.\nRather than provide factual support for their contention that a conflict of\ninterest exists between the court appointed Guardians and the Students at the BRI,\nthe Guardianship Counsel rely on the bald assertion that differences may exist\nbetween the Guardians and the Students concerning consent to aversive treatment to\njustify their appointment as next friend. Perhaps if consent to aversive treatment\nwas an issue in this case (and if there was some evidence supporting the existence\n10\n\nofthe claimed difference), the Guardianship Counsel's argument would have merit.\nHowever, Judge LaStaiti understood what the Guardianship Counsel fail to\nunderstand (or simply refuse to concede). The question of whether an individual\nstudent would consent to aversive treatment, or to any other treatment, is irrelevant\nto this ea_ and is decided in the individual substituted judgment hearings conducted\nfor each individual student. App. 241. In denying the Guardianship Counsel's\nmotion to be appointed as Next Friend, the Court stated that:\nThe matter before this Court is a Complaint for Contempt filed\nby BRI against the Department of Mental Retardation (DMR)\nand concerns enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.\nTreatment Issues are separately addressed in the Substituted\nJudgment Proceedings in the individual Guardianship Case.\nTreatment Decisions, with reference to aversive therapies,\nparticularly Level Ill aversives (including the GED) are\nstrenuously litigated in the Guardianship proceedings and such\ndecisions will not be part of the Contempt Action brought by\nBR! against DMR.\nApp. 241.\nThe Students, Parents, and Guardians have a direct and shared interest in\nthe contempt action: avoiding the precipitous termination of the BRI program.\nIndeed, the Guardianship Counsel acknowledge the importance of this interest\nwhen they claim that their decision to file their motion to intervene was triggered by\ntheir realization that there was a risk of decertification of the BRI program. 6 The\nbrief submitted by Guardianship Counsel is remarkable in that it devoid of any\nbasis whatsoever for concluding that the interests of the Students and the Parents\nand Guardians conflict with respect to the question of the Commissioner's\ncompliance, or lack thereof, to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.\nAccordingly, the Guardianship Counsel have provided no basis for reversing the\njudgment of Judge LaStaiti.\n6 Guardianship Counsel Brief at12.\n11\n\nTheselectionof by the Guardianship Counsel of Steven Schwartz to\nrepresent them in this proceeding makes a mockery of their stated concern for\nprotecting the Students from a conflict of interest and confirms the wisdom of\nJudge LaStaiti in denying the Guardianship Counsel motion. In contrast the\nParents and Guardians, Mr. Schwartz has a documented conflict of interest with the\nStudents at the BRI. Mr. Schwartz is the very same attorney who filed objections\nto the approval of the Settlement 'Agreement in 1987. App. 66-67. In rejecting\nthose objections, Judge Rotenberg criticized Mr. Schwartz for failing to disclose\nthat one of the students he represented no longer attended BRI, which made the\nobjections moot. App. 68. More importantly, for purposes of the matter before\nthis Court, Judge Rotenberg found that the interests of Mr. Schwartz were in\nconflict with those of his clients. Judge Rotenberg stated that :\nIn previous hearings before this Court, counsel for the objectors\nfiled an appearance on behalf of various organizations that\nadvocated the closure of BRI and termination of its program, a\nposition which differed markedly from that of the current\nobjectors.\nApp. 68. Judge Rotenberg further observed that:\nMoreover, the Court questions the role of counsel for the\nobjectors who had earlier propounded a point of view contrary if\nnot directly adverse to the persons whom he now purports to\nrepresent.\nApp. 69. Thus, Mr. Schwartz is on record as having advocated termination of the\ntreatment program offered by BRI and as having opposed acceptance of the\nSettlement Agreement.\nSince the Plaintiffs in the contempt action have invoked the protections\nembodied in the Settlement Agreement (which Mr. Schwartz opposed) in order to\nprevent the termination of the treatment option offered by the BRI program (which\nMr. Schwartz has advocated), it is difficult to imagine a more direct conflict\nbetween the interests of the Students and Mr. Schwartz. In light of this conflict,\nJudge LaStaiti denial of the Guardianship Counsel's motion was well-founded.\n12\n\nSeeLenhardv. Wolf, 443 U.S. t306, 1312 (1979) (stating that \"{h]owever worthy\nand high-minded the motives of next friends, they inevitably run the risk of making\nthe [ward] a pawn to be manipulated on a chess board larger than his own\".).\nEven if the Guardianship Counsel had identified a potential conflict of\ninterest between the Parents and Guardians and the Students, Rule 17(b) does not\nlimit the court's options to appointment of a guardian ad litem or next friend. As an\nalteruative, the court has the authority to \"make such other order as it deems proper\nfor the protection of the infant or incompetent person\". Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 17(b).\nIn this case, the court has done so, having appointed Attorneys Dorsey and Cataldo\nas an additional protection for the rights of the Students. App. 74.\nII. JUDGE LASTAITI PROPERLY DENIED THE MOTION\nOF THE GUARDIANSHIP COUNSEL TO INTERVENE\nON BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS AT THE BRI.\nThe Guardianship Counsel motion to intervene in the contempt action was\nfiled in their capacity as \"next friend\" to the Students, As a consequence, the denial\nof their motion for appointment as next friend deprives the Guardianship Counsel\nof standing to pursue a motion to intervene. Even if the Guardianship Counsel had\nstanding, they have failed to demonstrate that Judge LaStaiti abused her discretion\nin denying their motion. Therefore, there is no basis for granting the relief that the\nGuardianship Counsel request.\nA • Rule 24(a) Of The Massachusetts Rules Of Civil\nProcedure Precludes Intervention By The Guardianship\nCounsel•\nJudge LaStaiti's denial of the Guardianship Counsel's motion to intervene\nas a matter of right will be upheld unless she abused her discretion in denying the\nmotion. Cosby v. Department of Social Services, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 395, n.\n13\n\n8(1992) (stating that \"a trial court judge enjoys a full range of reasonable discretion\nin evaluating whether the requirements for intervention [of right] have been\nsatisfied\") (citations omitted). In order to intervene as a matter of right, a moving\nparty must:\n(a) make a timely application; (b) claim an interest relating to the\nproperty or transaction which is the subject of the transaction;\nand (c) be so situated that the disposition of the action may, as a\npractical matter, impair or impede the applicant's ability to\nprotect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately\nrepresented by existing parties.\nLd. at 394 (citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2)). Judge LaStaili properly denied the\nGuardianship motion to intervene because the Students are already members of the\nPlaintiff Class and because that Class is adequately represented in this proceeding.\nApp. 243-244. Neither the brief of the Guardianship Counsel nor the record in this\nproceeding provide an)' basis for concluding that Judge LaStaiti abused her\ndiscretion. Accordingly, their appeal must be denied.\n1. The Guardianship Counsel Failed To Make A Timely Application.\nThe Guardianship Counsel's argument that their motion to intervene, filed\nnearly seven months after the Complaint was filed in this proceeding 7, was timely\nrests upon a specious premise. The Guardianship Counsel contend that \"the critical\nevent triggering the students request 1o intervene was DMR's February 9, 1994\ncertification decision\" because it was only after that letter was issued that it became\n\"manifestly clear that this dispute could have severe ramifications for the students,\nincludingdecertification of BRi by early August of 1994\". Guardianship Counsel\nBrief at 12. The Guardianship Counsel further contend that it was only after this\n\"unexpected turn of events\" that these issues \"were identified as directly affecting\nthe students' rights and interests, rather than the sole interests of BRI\". Id. at 13,\n7\"l-he Complaint was filed on September 3, 1993, App. t9. The Guardianship Counsel filed their\nMotion To Inter_,'ene on March 31, 1994. App. 137.\n14\n\nn.18.If theletterofFebruary9,1994,hadtrulybeenthefirstindicationof\"severe\nramifications\"tothestudentst,hejustificationofferedbytheGuardianshipCounsel\nforthedelayinfilingtheirmotionwouldhavesomemerit. Inlightofthishistory\nof findingsof badfaithin the regulation of BRI, with which Mr. Schwartz is\ncertainly familiar, it is difficult to understand how the Guardianship Counsel failed\nto perceive complaints filed by BRI in September and October of 1993 alleging bad\nfaith on the part of the Commonwealth as portending anything less than severe\nramifications for the Students.\n2. The Guardianship Counsel Have No Interest In This Proceeding\nThere is no dispute that the Students at the BRI have a direct interest in this\ncontempt proceeding. Ho_vever, the fact thai the Students have an interest in this\nproceeding does not translate into the Guardianship Counsel having an interest in\nthis proceeding. Notwithstanding the argument of Mr. Schwartz that _he Students\nshould be allowed to participate in the Contempt proceeding through counsel of\ntheir choice (App. 200), :here is no evidence that suggests that the Students have\nchosen the Guardianship Counsel to represent them in the contempt action or in any\nother action. The Students have not chosen the Guardianship Counsel to represent\nthem in the substituted judgment proceedings. They have been appointed by the\nProbate Court. App.137. Nor do the Guardianship Counsel contend in their\nComplaint For lnter,'ention that they have been chosen by the Students. App. 137.\nInstead, the Guardianship Counsel state that they are acting as next friend to the\nStudents. l_d. Thus, the record in this proceeding shows the only interest that the\nGuardianship Counsel are advancing is their own.\nUnlike the Guardianship Counsel, the Students, Parents and Guardians\nhave a direct and shared interest in the contempt action. As Judge Rotenberg\n15\n\nrecognized it is the Students and their families that will suffer the consequences of\nan unjustified termination of the BRI program. S.A. 16-17.\n3_ The Interests Of The Students Are Already Adequately Represented\nIn This Proceeding.\nThe most compelling reason for denying the Guardianship Counsel's\nMotion To Intervene is that the interests of the Students are adequately represented\nin this proceeding. Under Rule 24(a), \"[t]he burden of showing the inadequacy of\nthe representation is on the applicant\". Attorney General v. Brockton Agricultural\nSociety, 390 Mass. 431,434 (1983) Satisfying that burden would have required\nthe Guardianship Counsel to show that the structure of representation that has been\nrepeatedly found effective in protecting the rights of the Students in this lengthy and\ncomplex ploceeding is somehow inadequate. Because the Guardianship Counsel\nfailed to meet their burden, Judge LaStaiti properly denied their motion.\nFrom the very early stages of this proceeding, the Students have participated\nas members of the Class, with their interests represented by their Parents and\nGuardians. _ As Judge Rotenberg observed when preliminarily certifying the Class:\nIt is also clear and irrefutable to this Court that the parents\nand/or guardians should be joined preliminarily as members\nof the class as they speak for their children who cannot\nspeak for themselves; and their concerns are identical, the\npreservation of the lives of these disadvantaged human\nbeings.\nApp. 42. Robert A. Sherman, Esquire initially represented the Class and executed\nthe Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Class. App. 64. _ The Parents and\nGuardians of the BRI Students continue to speak as the voice of the Students\nthrough the vehicle of the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc.. which has\nInfact, while initially disputing thecertification of the Class. the Guardianship Counsel now\nconcede that\"the students are part ofaunified class comprised ofallstudents and parents\".\nGuardianship Counsel Briefat23.\n16\n\nretained and directs counsel. App. 228-229. Judge LaStaiti determined that the\nParents continue to adequately represent the interests of the Students, stating:\nAt all time, the Parents are aware of BRI's program and have\ndemonstrated a strong commitment to the welfare and best\ninterests of the Students.\nApp. 242. Judge LaStaiti further determined that \"It]he entire class is adequately\nrepresented by Eugene Curry, Esquire\". App. 243.\nAs an additional protection, the interests of the Students within the Class\nhave, from the early stages of the litigation, been represented by Counsel appointed\nby the Court. Initially, attorneys Marc Perlin and Max Volterra were appointed by\nJudge Rotenberg on April 29, 1986 \"to represent the potential class of all students\nat the Behavior Research Institute, Inc.\". App. 71. Although no class of Students\nwas ever certified, Mr. Perlin and Mr. Volterra continued to represent the Students\nin the BRI litigation and the negotiations that led to the Settlement. Id. Both\nattorneys executed the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the \"B.R.I. clients\".\nApp. 64. In November of 1993, Judge LaStaiti, recognizing that the Students have\n\"the most vital interest in the process and outcome of any litigation\", appointed\nattorneys Paul A. Cataldo and C. Michelle Dorsey to represent the class of students.\nApp. 74.\nIn order to support their claim of lack of adequate representation, the\nGuardianship Counsel strain unsuccessfully to fashion an illusory conflict of\ninterest between the Parents and Guardians and the Students themselves. The\nargument rests principally on the contention that cases such as\nCommissioner of the Department of Mental Health, 390 Mass. 489 (1983) which\nrestrict the ability of parents and guardians to consent to certain treatments,\nincluding the administration of anti-psychotic medication. The Guardianship\nCounsel argue _ represents 'an implicit determination that parents and\n'_Even Mr. Schv,'artz agrees that Mr. Sherman \"at that time represented the class of parents and\n17\n\nguardians cannot adequately represent the interest of their wards in these\nsituations\". _°\nThe reliance of the Guardianship Counsel on cases such as _ is\nmisplaced. As a preliminary matter, _ does not stand for the proposition that\na presumptive conflict exists between an institutionalized individual and his or her\nguardian. To the contrary, the Court in _ stated that in contrast to medical\nstaff, who may have a conflict of interest, \"if an incompetent has a guardian, the\nguardian is presumably in a neutral position since the guardian is not living with the\npatient at the time that treatment decisions are being made\". Id. at 504. More\nfundamentally, the issue at stake in Ro__qg._, whether an incompetent individual\nwould consent to certain treatment, is irrelevant to the issue in the contempt action.\nAs Judge La Staiti recognized, this case \"concerns enforcement of the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement\" while \"Treatment Decisions, with reference to Level I11\naversive-therapies, particularly Level !11 aversives, (including GED) are\nstrenuously litigated in the Guardianship proceedings and such decisions will not be\npart of the Contempt Action brought by BRI against DMR\". App. 241.\nThe Guardianship Counsel have failed to identify any actual conflict\nbetween the interest of the Parents and Guardians and the Students with respect to\nenforcement of the Settlement Agreement. The contention that a conflict exists\nbetween the status of the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. as a corporate\nintervenor and as class representative rests on several inaccurate (and unsupported)\nassertions. Guardianship Counsel Brief at 25-26. First, as is clear from the docket\nin this proceeding, the Parents and Guardians do not participate as intervenors, but\nas members of the Class. App. 1-40. Second, in direct violation of Rule 16(e) of\nstudents\". App. 190.\n_oGuardianship Counsel Briefat25.\n18\n\nwithoutcitationtotherecord,thattheparents and guardians participation in this\nproceeding is the result of a contractual obligation to cooperate with BRI.\nGuardianship Counsel Brief at 26. It is riot surprising that the Guardianship\nCounsel are unable to cite any record support for this attack on the integrity of the\nfamilies of the BRI Students, as it has no basis in fact. Most fundamentally, the\nGuardianship Counsel's argument ignores the extensive history of involvement in\nthis and related proceedings by the Parents and Guardians on behalf of the\nStudents.\nEqually meritless is the contention advanced by the Guardianship Counsel\nthat the appointment of attorneys Cataldo and Dorsey constitutes a recognition by\nJudge LaStaiti that the Parents and Guardians cannot represent the Students within\nthe Class. Guardianship Counsel Brief at 26, n. 36. There is no question that\nJudge LaStaiti recognized the potential for a conflict within the Class and appointed\nattorneys Dorsey and Cataldo to protect the Students from \"any potential conflict\nwith the interests of the Parents and Guardians, who are also members of the\nClass\". App. 243. However, the interpretation that Guardianship Counsel would\nattach to Judge LaStaiti's order is at odds with Judge LaStaiti's conclusion that \"the\nStudents' rights under the Settlement Agreement will be enforced as a Class\" and\nthat \"It]he entire class is adequately represented by Eugene Curry, Esquire\". App.\n243.\nThe record unquestionably demonstrates that Judge LaStaiti was concerned\na real, rather than potential, conflict of interest when she appointed attorneys\nCataldo and Dorsey. Judge LaStaiti stated that she \"remained acutely aware of the\noccurlences of bias and bad faith demonstrated by agencies of the Commonwealth\nagainst BRI, parents, and wards of the Court\" and, therefore, \"It]his Court must\nremain vigilant to ensure that this class is represented by counsel who are as\nindependent and objective as can be from the influence of any state agency\". App\n19\n\n74. Theconcernsexpressedby Judge LaStaitiare particularlyrelevantto\nconsideringtheGuardianshipCounseml otion. Attorney Schwartz's advocacy of\nterminating the BR1 program in the earlier litigation calls into question his\nindependence from the influence of DMR.\nThe record before Judge LaStaiti clearly supported her conclusion that\nAttorneys Cataldo and Dorsey were adequately representing the BRI Students\nwithin the Class. Both counsel are highly qualified and have acted zealously to\nprotect the interests of the Student members of the class. App. 24, 75-78. Most\nimportantly, unlike the counsel proposed by Guardianship Counsel, neither\nAttorney Dorsey or Cataldo have any conflict of interest with the interests of the\nStudents. _'-\nB, Rule 24(b) Precludes Permissive Intervention By The\nGuardianship Counsel\nUnder Rule 24(b), the question of \"whether a party should be allowed to\nintervene is a matter that that is largely left to the discretion of the judge below\".\nCorcoran v. Wigglesworth Machinery. Co.. 388 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1983)\n(citations omitted). The \"decision of the trial court will be reversed only for a clear\nabuse of discretion\". Massachusetts Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO v.\nSchool Committce of Chelsea, 409 Mass. 203, 209 (1991). Because intervention\nby the Guardianship Counsel would unduly delay and prejudice the adjudication of\nrights of the existing parties, Judge LaStaiti properly exercised her discretion in\ndenying the Guardianship Counsel's Motion For Permissive Intervention. _3\n_: The Guardianship Coun_l's principal argument with respect the adequacy of the representation\nof the attorneys for the Students is their contention thatAttorneys Cataldo and Dorsey cannot\nrepresent the Students because noclass of Students has ever been certified. Guardianship Counsel\nBrief at 26-32. The Guardianship Counsel's contention is not only without merit, it is predicated\non numerous factual contentions for which :here is no record support in\",'iolation of Rule 16(e) of\nthe glass. R. App. Pro.\n_3Ma._.R.Civ.P. Rule 24(b)12) states inpertinent part that \"Upon timely application anyone may\nbe permitted to intervene in an action: ... _,hen applicant's claim or defense and the main action\n20\n\nThe most powerful argumentagainstthat allowing the Guardianship\nCounselto intervenepermissivelymaybefoundin theGuardianshipCounsel's\nownbrief. The Guardianship Counsel contend that:\nPermitting intervention by the students would assist\nin determining whether BRI has consistently acted\nwithin the requirements set forth in the Settlement\nAgreement, particularly with respect to whether the\ntreatment given was the least restrictive treatment\npossible in each individual case.\nGuardianship Counsel Brief at 36-37 (emphasis supplied). The Guardianship\nCounsel's own words make it plain that if allowed to intervene, they would seek\nthe review of the treatment plans of each and every Student at the BRI as part of the\nContempt litigation. As Judge LaStaiti recognized, the treatment decisions that\naffect individual students are litigated in the individual Substituted Judgment\nproceedings and are irrelevant to the question of whether the Commissioner has\nviolated the terms of the Settlement Agreement. App. 241. Courts have recognized\nthat \"inlerventions, although aimed at accomplishing economies of scale, threaten to\nsome degree, small or large to complicate the procedure, increase expenses, and\nengender delays\". Care and Protection o.f Zelda, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 869, 872\n(1989). It is beyond serious question that expanding the scope of the Contempt\nlitigation as contemplated by the Guardianship Counsel would significantly\ncomplicate the litigation, increase the expense and engender delays to the obvious\ndetriment of the existing parties.\nIn essence, the Guardianship Counsel's argument is a restatement of the\nfailed objections advanced by Attorney Schwartz against the Settlement Agreement.\nThen, as now, Attorney Schwartz sought to raise the issue of individual treatment\ndecisions in the context of the overall Settlement Agreement. App. 67. Then, as\nnow, Attorney Schwartz claimed that two Students objected to the Settlement\nhave a question oflaw or fact incommon.... Inexercising itsdiscretion the court shallconsider\n_hether the intervention v,itlunduly delay or prejudice the adjudication ofthe rights of the\n21\n\nAgreement without disclosing to the Court that one of those Students had left BRI,\nApp. 68, 191 lines 2-10. It is beyond serious question that allowing the\nGuardianship Counsel to relitigate \"objections filed at the eleventh hour in this case\nwhich relate primarily to factual matters earlier fully and fairly litigated and\ndetermined\" (App. 69) would prejudice the rights of the existing parties to\nadjudicate this matter.\nindividualpaaies\".\n22\n\nIll.

(S.A. 151). t First, there is DMR's appeal after trial from\na judgment of contempt and order dated October 6, 1995. (App. 1353). Second,\nDMR appeals from the issuance of a pre-trial preliminary injunction dated I',larch\n24, 1995. (App. 128). Finally, JRC appeals from the modification of the\npreliminary injunction by a Single Justice of the Appeals Court (Brown, J.).\n(S.A. 137).\nA. The Contempt Proceedings\nThe genesis of this case began on February 28, 1986, when the Behavior\nResearch Institute, nov.' known as the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, Inc.\n(\"JRC\" or \"BRI\"), and a proposed class of parents acting individually, and on\nbehalf of their children enrolled at JRC, filed a Complaint against the\nMassachusetts Office for Children and its Director (\"OFC\"). (App. 52). OFC\nhad issued orders requiring JRC to stop treatments for its severely\ndevelopmentally disabled student population, closing intake at the school, and\nthreatening suspension of JRC's license. (App. 52). The Complaint asserted\ncivil rights violations and sought injunctive relief for OFC's bad faith regulatory\nand licensing activities. (App. 52) The action was filed in the Bristol County\nProbate and Family Court and the late Justice Ernest Rotenberg was specially\nassigned as a Superior Court Justice to hear all of the claims (the \"Trial Court\").\n(App. 5).\nBecause of the severe harm being caused to the students, Plaintiffs moved\nfor a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin OFC from terminating the\ntreatment plans. (App. 81). Following an evidentiary hearing, the Trial Court\nissued a decision on June 4, 1986 which made extensive findings regarding the\ni All references to the record herein are referenced as follows: references tothe\nAppendix cited as \"App. ;\" references to the Trial Transcript according to volume\nand consecutive numbered pages therein cited as \"Tr., ;\" references toUncontested\nTrial Exhibits and pages therein cited as \"U- , '\" references to Trial Exhibits\nadmitted by JRC and pages therein cited as \"JRC- , ;\" references toTrial Exhibits\nadmitted by DMR and pages therein cited as \"DMR-, , ;\" and references to the\nSupplemental Appendix submitted by JRC cited as S.._. .\n\nDirector'sbadfaithregulatorypracticesandgrantedtherequestedinjunction.\n(App.107).A SingleJusticeof theAppealsCourt(GreaneyC, .J.)deniedthe\nDirectorrelieffromthepreliminaryinjunctionc,oncludingthattherewasample\nsupportfortheTrialCourt'sfindingsofbadfaithandtheinjunctionwhichhad\nbeenissued.(App.109-111,113).\nFollowinginjunctiverelief,BRI,thePlaintiffClassandOFCengageidn\nsettlemendtiscussionswhichculminatedin a SettlemenAt greemendtated\nDecembe1r2,1996.(\"SettlemenAtgreement\").(13-2;App.120,13l).

AmongitsprovisionsP, artA of the Settlement Agreement provided that\ntreatment decisions for JRC students were to be made by the Court using the\nsubstituted judgment criteria. (U-2, 2). Pursuant to Paragraph B, Dr. John\nDaignault was appointed as Court Monitor (\"Court Monitor\" or \"Dr. Daignault\")\nto undertake \"general monitoring of JRC's treatment and educational program,\"\nand to arbitrate any disputes between the parties. (U-2, 6). Finally the parties\nwere required to act in good faith in carrying out their responsibilities under the\nSettlement Agreement. (U-2, 14).\nThe Trial Court's order provided for the termination of the Settlement\nAgreement in one year \"unless the Court orders otherwise.\" (-U-4). After two\nsix-month extensions, on July 7, 1988, the Trial Court issued an order extending\njurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement \"until further order of this Court.\"\n(App. 135-137). The order noted that there were no objections to the extension\nof jurisdiction. (App. 137).\nOn December 29, 1988, the Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR M)\nmoved to amend the Settlement Agreement. DMR entered the case as successor\nto OFC and the Departmen:: of Mental Health (\"DMH\") in regulating JRC. (U-\n13). The Trial Court specially noted that it was treating DMR's motion as an\nintervention under Rule 24 and \"welcom[ed] [DMRI as a party under the\nSettlement Agreement.\" (U-13). DMl._ did not appeal or otherwise challenge the\nCourt's order.\n\nTheproceedingwshichgaverise1othejudgmenot fcontempbt,eganon\nSeptembe7r,1993,whenJRCfiledacomplainftorcontempptursuantot Mass.\nR.Civ.P.65.3againsDtMRCommissionPerhilipCampbecUlaimingviolations\nof thecourt-approveSdettlemenAtgreement.(S.A.27). In essenceJ,RC's\nclaimsas amendedallegedinter alia thatthe Commissionevriolatedthe\nSettlemenAtgreement by interfering with court-authorized treatment provisions,\nrefusing to mediate disputes with Dr. Daignault, and failing to act in good faith\nin his regulatiott of JRC.\nOn March 23, 1995, the Commissioner decertified JRC and ordered all\ncourt-approved treatment procedures stopped as of July 1, 1995. (U-179). The\nnext day, JRC moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the\nCommissioner from revoking JRC's certification, and preserve the sta_.t.@_\npending trial. The Trial Court allowed the motion that same date. (App. 283). 2\nThe trial of JRC's contempt claims took place during three weeks inJune\nand July of 1995. The Trial Court heard from seventeen witnesses and admitted\nover four hundred exhibits. In its Judgment and Order dated October 6, 1995,\nthe Trial Court held the Commissioner in contempt, finding that he had violated\nthe provisions of the Settlement Agreement thereby causing \"egregious and\nirreparable\" harm to JRC, its students and their parents. (App. 1340). As a\nremedy for the contempt, the Trial Court ordered that DMR be enjoined from\nfailing to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and from\ninterfering with outstanding treatment orders issued by the Court. (App. 1340,\n1342). The trial judge also ordered that DMR be stripped of its regulatory\nattthority over JRC and a receiver ,,','as appointed to assume DMR's regulatory\nresponsibilities over JRC until further order of the Court. (App. 1342-1348).\nPlaintiffs were also awarded attorneys fees and expenses. (App. 1341).\nFinal judgment entered on October 6, 1995. (App. 48). On October 11,\n1995, the Commissioner filed his notice of appeal. (App. 1353). Thereafter,\n: After Judge Rotenberg's death, Judge Elizabeth O'Neill LaStaiti of the Probate\nand Family Court was specially assigned in August 1992 as a Justice of the Superior\nCourt to replace Judge Rotenberg with respect tothese matters. (App. 1207).\n3\n\nthisCourtgrantedDirectAppellate Review anti the appeal was docketed as $JC-\n07101.\nThe Commissioner filed a Motion to Stay the injunctive and receivership\norders pursuant to glass. R. Civ. P. 62(a), which was denied by the Trial Court\non November 6, 1995. (App. 1432). Thereafter, the Commissioner renewed his\nMotion to Stay in the Appeals Court, pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 6(a). where\na Single Justice, (Smith, J.), denied the motion on November 28, 1995 fol ,wing\na hearing. (App. 1454).\nAlter receiving the Single Justice's decision, the Commissioner filed a\npetition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, § 3, with a Single Justice of this Court\nrequesting relief from the denial of the stay by both the Trial Court and the\nSingle Justice of the Appeals Court. (App. 1456) On December 5, 1995, this\nCourt (l,ynch, J.) denied the motion. (App. 1465). On December 8, 1995, the\nCommissioner then filed an appeal from the order of the Single Justice pursuant\nto SJC Rule 2:21, docketed as SJC-07093, as '.','ell as a request for a stay of the\nSingle Justice's order. (App. 1466, 1467). On January 12, 1996, the full bench\nt_fthis Court denied the requested stay pending appeal, and dismissed the appeal\nas both moot and in violation of SJC Rule 2:21 See Commissioner of Mental\nRetardation v. Judge Rotenberg l:'ducational Center, Inc., 421 glass. 1010\n(1996). (App. 1471).\nB. ._peal From The Preliminary Injunction - SJC-06956\nOn March 24, 1995, the Trial Court entered a status _ preliminary\ninjunction in favor of JRC and the Plaintiff Class enjoining the Commissioner\nfrom decertifying the JRC treatment program pending a trial on the merits of the\ncontempt action. (S.A. 127). The Commissioner appealed the injunction to a\nfull panel of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, § 118, ¶ 2. (S.A.\n128). This Court granted direct appellate review and the appeal was docketed\nas SJC-06956.\nOn October 31, 1995, JRC filed a Motion to Dismiss SJC-06956 on the\ngrounds that the final judgment entered by the Trial Court in the contempt case\nrendered an appeal from an interlocutory preliminary injunction order moot.\n(S.A. 138). Following a hearing and report of the Single Justice (Greaney, J.),\n4\n\nthisCourtdeniedthemotiontodismissonMarch8,1996,andorderedthatany\nissuesinSJC-0695b6ebriefedaspartoftheappeaflromthefinaljudgmenotf\ncontempint SJC-07101(.S.A.151).\nC. Appeal From ModificationOf InterlocutoryOrders By\nTheSingleJusticeOfTheAopeals Court- SJC-07045\nIn addition to filing an appeal to the full panel of the Appeals Court, the\nCommissioner filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 231, § 118, ¶ 1, seeking relief\nor modification of the Trial Court's order dated March 24, 1995 granting the\npreliminary injunction. (SA. 129). The petition was docketed as 95-J-300. On\nMay 11, 1995, without a hearing and without providing JRC with any\nopportunity to respond, a Single Justice of the Appeals Court (Brown, J.)\nmodified the preliminary injunction by adding a third subparagraph which\nordered that JRC stop using four treatment procedures which had been previously\nauthorized by the Probate Court. (S.A. 133).\nIn a related matter, the court-appointed counsel in fifty-two guardianship\nproceedings filed identical motions in the Probate Court to stop these same four\ntreatment procedures (\"Global Motion\"). (S.A. 40-41). On April 14, 1995, the\nTrial Court denied the Global Motion. (S.A. 67). Guardianship Counsel then\nfiled a petition with the Single Justice of the Appeals Court for interlocutory\nrelief from the denial of the Global Motion, which was docketed as 95-J-362.\n(S.A. 135). On June 7, 1995, again without a hearing, the Single Justice\n(Brov, n, J.) modified the denial of the Global Motion by incorporating the order\nof 95-J-300 into the order in 95-J-362. (S.A. 135).\nOn June 12, 1995, in response to a motion to clarify filed by DMR, the\nSingle Justice issued a supplemental order in 95-J-300 expressly setting forth the\nfour treatment procedures JRC was required to terminate, which were the same\nas those listed in95-1-362. (S.A. 134). JRC filed a petitionunder G. L. c. 21I,\n§ 3, with a Single Justice of this Court (Abrams, J.) seeking to vacate the\nmodification of the preliminary injunction a,_d restore the status _ pending\ntrial. The petition1 was denied. (S.A. 136). JRC then filed an appeal to a full\npanel of the Appeals Court from the parallel orders entered in 95-J-300 and 95-J-\n5\n\n362. Thatconsolidateadppeawl asdocketedasSJC-07045afterthisCourt\ngra_lted directed appellate review. (S.A. 137).\nOn January 4, 1996, JRC filed a motion to dismiss SJC-07045 with the\nSingle Justice of this Court on the grounds that the entry of final judgment in the\ncontempt action rendered an appeal from the interlocutory orders moot.\n(S.A. 144). On March 8, 1996, the full bench of this Court, after report by the\nSingle Justice, denied the motion and instructed the parties to brief the issues\nraised in SJC-07045 in the appeal from the final judgment of contempt. (S.A.\n151).\n6\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS _\nA. The JRC Program\nJRC is a residential school for severely developmentally disabled and\nautistic individuals with serious behavior disorders. (Tr. VIIA, 51-52). The\nJRC students exhibit extreme and often life-threatening, self-injurious and\naggressive behaviors, which other placements have not been able to treat\nsuccessfully. O__.) Behaviors exhibited by the students include banging their\nheads to the point of causing brain injury, pulling out their hair, rubbing off their\nskin to the point of bone infection, breaking their own bones, rubbing off parts\nof their nose, biting off other people's noses, and poking their eyes to the point\nof causing severe retinal damage and permanent blindness. (Tr. VIIA, 52).\nBecause of these severe behavior problems, the average IRC student has been\nrejected by five placements and expelled by nine others prior to coming to JRC.\n(Tr. VIIA, 53). The JRC program is the largest collection of difficult-to-treat\nclients in one program in the nation, if not the world, fir. VIIA, 51-52). In\n1993, seventy-five percent of JRC's sixty-five clients were placed and funded by\nstates other than Massachusetts. fir. VI1A, 43).\nThe JRC program utilizes behavioral therapy to suppress the students'\nsevere problematic behaviors, and provide the students with an environment rich\nin care, affection and opportunities to live as normal a life as possible. (JRC-\n239; JRC-240). Behavioral therapy utilized at JRC consists of rewards to\nincrease the students' positive behaviors, and \"aversive procedures\" such as token\nfines or loss of privileges, or when necessary, electrical skin stimulation to\nsuppressthe IRC students' dangerous behaviors. 0RC-239; JRC-240; U-152,10-\n44). Dr. Matthew Israel, a psychologist and JRC's founder and Executive\nDirector for twenty-four years ('Dr. Israel\"), and his staff have successfully\ntreated students with some of the most severe behavior disorders in the nation\nCitationsin this Statement of Fact areto the trial transcripts and trial exhibits,\nand not tothe Trial Court's Findings of Fact, because the Commissioner argues inhis\nbrief that all of the Trial Court's three hundred and three findings of fact are clearly\nerron_3us.\n7\n\nandprovidedthe,IRC students an opportunity to live a happy, dignified and\nproductive life. (JRC-239; JRC-240; Tr. VIIA, 51-52). DMR's own licensing\nevaluation from 1994 praised the JRC program as providing the students with a\nhealthy and stable living environment with close interaction between students and\nstaff which encourages family involvement and improvement in daily living\nskills. (U-164,2,6,21,27,31-32,40-41,47).\nB. The 1986 Litigation and the Settlement Agreement\nOn December 12, 1986, JRC, the parents of students at JRC, and the\nstudents through their legal representatives, entered into a Settlement Agreement\nwith OFC. (U-2). The Settlement Agreement put to rest litigation between the\nCommonwealth and JRC which had been initiated on September 26, 1985, when\nOFC issued an order to show cause why JRC's license to operate should not be\nsuspended, and ordered JRC's treatment procedures terminated. (U-2). In the\nperiod following September 26, 1985, protracted litigation occurred, including\nthe filing of a civil rights complaint against the director of OFC. (App. 52).\nBecause of the irreparable harm being caused to JRC aml its students from the\nOFC orders, plaintiffs moved tbr injunctive relief. (App. 78-79). On June 4,\n1986, the Trial Court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining OFC from\nenforcing its orders and concluded in extensive findings that the director of OFC\nhad engaged in bad faith regulation of JRC, and that her termination of JRC's\ntreatment procedures was without medical support leaving the program an \"empty\nshell for those students who require aversives as part of their treatment.\" (App.\n82, 87, 96, 107). The Court further found that the director of OFC attempted\nto hide the lack of clinical support for her decision by altering her own agency's\nlaudatory report of JRC, and by sending an evaluation team biased against the\nuse of aversive therapy to conduct an \"objective\" evaluation of the JRC program.\n(App. 104-107). The Trial Court therefore found that the director's orders\nconstituted arbitrary treatment decisions that \"played 'Russian roulette' with the\nlives and safety of the students at [JRCI.\" (App. 107).\nThe preliminary injunction was upheld by a Single Justice of the Appeals\nCourt (Greaney, C.J.) who ruled that there was ample evidence to support both\n\ntheTrialCourt's entry of injunctive relief and his conclusion that the director\nacted in \"bad faith in the handling of the status of [JRC's] license and its\ntreatment programs. _ (App. 110). Thereafter, oa October 31, 1986, the Trial\nCourt awarded JRC, and the parents, _ lit¢, the sum of $580,605.25,\nwhich represented the legal fees incurred as a result of OFC's bad faith actions.\n(S.A. 1).\nFollowing the award of attorney's fees, the parties engaged in settlement\ndiscussions which culminated in the execution of a Settlement Agreement on\nDecember 12, 1986. (U-2). The Settlement Agreement by its plain terms, was\nintended to protect JRC's treatment program from bad faith and arbitrary\ninterference by state agencies. 0.d_.). The keystone was Part A which provided\nthat treatment decisions were to be made by the Court using the substituted\njudgement criteria. (I/-2, 2).\nOther provisions of the Settlement Agreement which were important\nprotections for JRC included the following:\nDr. John Daignault, appoioted as Court Monitor, would\noversee JRC's compliance with all applicable state\nregulations, except to the extent those regulations\ninvolved treatment decisions, which were reserved for\nthe Trial Court pursuant to Part A of the Settlement\nAgreement. (I B-2). (13-2, 6).\nAll regulatory disputes or concerns between the parties\nwere required to be submitted to Dr. Daignault for\nresolution. In the event that any party disagreed with\nthe resolution of Dr. Daignault, the matter would be\nsubmitted to the Trial Court. (I B-2). (U-2, 7).\nIntake at JRC was re-opened and \"shall not be\nimpermissibly obstructed during the pendency of this\nproceeding.\" (¶ C-3). (U-2, 7-8); and\nAll parties would be required to act in good faith in\ndischarging their obligations under the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement. (¶ L). (U-2, 14).\nThus, the Settlement Agreement provided JRC with five forms of\nprotection:\n\n1. Havingthe Trial Court, not a regulatoryagency,\nauthorizeand/ordisapprovetreatmentthroughthe\nsubstitutejdudgmenptroceduredescribeidn PartAof\ntheSettlemenAgtreement.\n2. Vesting in the Court Monitor the authority to oversee\nJRC's compliance with all applicable state regulations;\n3. Vesting in the Court Monitor the authority to resolve all\ndisputes between JRC and its regulatory authority (now\nDMR) with appeals of those decisions submitted to the\nTrial Court for final resolution;\n4. A strict prohibition against impermissibly obstructing\nJRC's intake of new clients; and\n5. A requirement that all parties act in good faith.\nOn January 7, 1987, the Trial Court lbund the Settlement Agreement to\nbe fair, reasonable, and adequate, and incorporated the Settlement Agreement as\nan Order of the Court. (S.A. 18). On February 12, 1987, the Trial Court issued\na memorandum to all parties in the case, which addressed the aspects of the\nCourt Monitor's role under the Settlement Agreement. (App. 134). In\nparticular, the Court stated as follows: \"Lastly, all parties are reminded of the\nMonitor's role as outlined in the Settlement Agreement insofar as all conflicts\nand disputes shall be brought initially to the Monitor for attempted resolution.\n(emphasis added). (App. 134).\nAs a result of the Settlement Agreement, regulatory authority over JRC\nwas transferred from OFC to DMR (as the successor agency to DMH). (U-7).\nOn October 24, 1988, DMR filed a motion to modify the Settlement Agreement.\n(U-10). Plaintiffs, however, citing Mass. R. Cir. P. 15 responded that DMR\nhad no standing to amend the Settlement Agreement unless the agency were a\nparty to the proceeding. On December 17, 1988, the Trial Court accepted the\nmotion filed by DMR as an intervention under rule 24 and welcomed DMR as\na \"party under the Settlement Agreement.\" (U-13).\n10\n\nC. ForSixYearsDMRAcknowledged It Was A Party Under The\nSettlement Aereement And Abided By.Its Provisions\nFrom 1987 to 1993, JRC and its students recovered from the controversy\nof 1985 to 1986 and thrived. As set forth in innumerable findings of the Trial\nCourt invarious guardianship actions, JRC students enjoyed tremendous benefits\nfrom JRC's treatment programs. Indeed, the Trial Court made findings in\nnumerous cases that JRC's treatment procedures had been life-saving for the JRC\nstudents. (JRC-239, 240).\nFor six years from 1987 until August 1993, when it abruptly changed its\ninternel position, DMR maintained that it was party to the Settlement Agreement\nand subject to its commands. For instance, DMR acknowledged in court\ndocuments, including memoranda and briefs filed with this Court and the Appeals\nCourt, that it was a party to the Settlement Agreement. Specifically, in both a\nmemorandum to this Court dated April 14, 1989, and a brief to the full bench\nin the case of In The Matter Of McKnight, DMR refers to the 1985/1986\nlitigation as follows:\nThat action was resolved by Settlement Agreentent entered as an\nOrder of the Probate Court on January 7, 1987. DMR is a party\nto that Settlement Agreement, having been joined by Order of\nthe Probate Court dated December 29, 1988 in response to\nDMR's motion, which was grounded on DMR's role in licensing\nand regulating providers of treatment for autism.\n(emphasis supplied). (JRC-253, 5). (In The Matter Of McKnight, 406 Mass.\n787 (1990), Appellant's Brief at p.6).\nDMR not only acknowledged its status as the party to the Settlement\nAgreement, but also its limited role in treatment decisions. On February 28,\n1992, the director of the Office of Quality Assurance for the Mental Retardation\nConsent Decrees (an agency established to monitor DMR's compliance with a\nfederal court consent decree) sent a letter to Commissioner Campbell requesting\nthat he carefully scrutinize an application for recer!ification that JRC had\nsubmitted in 1991. (U-40.) At the Commissioner's request, DMR General\nCounsel Kim Murdock responded on March 17, 1992, that:\n[Dlue to past litigation, the Department is currently bound by a\nSettlement Agreement with respect to this program. All so-\n11\n\ncalledaversiveinterventionnssedatBRImustbeapprovedby\ntheBristolCountyProbateCourt;theDepartmenti'nsvolvement\nin the actual treatment is limited .... I suggest you contact the\nCourt Monitor for the BRI case, Dr. John Daignault. He can be\nreached at (508) 583-0828. Dr. Daignault is in a far better\nposition to provide you with answers to your questions.\n(emphasis supplied). (U-41,1).\nDMR also recognized the Court Monitor's authority under the Settlement\nAgreement. Dr. Daignault had a highly collegial and excellent working\nrelationship with Commissioner Campbell's predecessor, Commissioner Mary\nMcCarthy. fir. II, 31). Between October 19, 1986, and September 1988, Dr.\nDaignault had several meetings and numerous telephone calls with Commissioner\nMcCarthy and her staff regarding issues in',olving JRC. (Tr. 11, 31-32). The\nprimary issues concerned JRC's licensure and later, licensure and certification,\nsince those issues were of primary concern to the Trial Court. (Tr. II, 31-33).\nIn the context of those meetings, a number of issues ',,,'erediscussed including the\nobligations of DMR under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Dr.\nDaignault's mediation role, Dr. Daignault's oversight of JRC's regulatory\ncompliance, and the issue of treatment decisions being made by the Trial Court.\nAt no time d_d either Commissioner McCarthy or General Counsel Murdock,\nwho often attended the meetings, ever dispute the fact that DMR had an\nobligation to arbitrate disputes with Dr. Daignault, nor did they question his\nauthority to oversee JRC's compliance with DMR regulations. (Tr. I1, 36-37).\nNor did the DMR officials contest the authority of the Court to make treatment\ndecisions, fir. II, 40). Commissioner McCarthy specifically sought out Dr.\nDaignault's input when DMR promulgated regulations regarding \"Level I11\"\nprocedures, which include interventions such as the aversive procedures utilized\nat JRC. In particular, the Department was concerned that its proposed\nregulations be consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. (Tr. 11,\n40-42). That process resulted in JRC receiving a two-year \"Level 111\"\ncertification on April 20, 1989. (U-15).\nWith respect to Dr. Daignault's mediation role, in early 1987 an issue\narose whether an oflicial of DMH was violating the Settlement Agreement by\n12\n\ninterferingwithJRC'sintake. IRCrequestemdediationunderthe Settlement\nAgreement and Dr. Daignault, under his authority to arbitrate disputes, convened\na meeting which was attended by representatives of DMR. The problem was\nworked out. (Tr. 11,42-45).\" Later, in May 1987, there was a separate request\nfor mediation when /RC was concerned by a lack of referrals. Again, Dr.\nDaignault held a meeting under his authority to arbitrate disputes which was\nattended by officials from DMR and in which the problem was addressed. (Tr.\n11,66). Dr. Daignault's mediation role continued in November 1989, when IRC\nrequested a meeting concerning delays in its licensure. Dr. Daignault again\nconvened a mediation session under Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement Agreement\nattended by DMR which resnlted in agreements on several important issues and\nwhich ultimately resulted in JRC's licensure two months later. (Tr. I1, 55-60;\nU-25,27).\nIn addition to Dr. Daignault's arbitration role, DMR also called upon him\nto oversee JRC's compliance with regulations. On January 19, 1990, General\nCounsel Murdock wrote to Dr. Daignault concerning two abuse complaints. She\nstated in her letter:\nI have reviewed these complaints and conclude that the acts\ndescribed all fall within the category treatments JRC is\nauthorized to use. This being the case, I can see no basis for an\ninvestigation by DMR under the abuse regulations at this time.\nHowever, I am forwarding these complaints to you as the Court\nMonitor to look into two matters, whether the treatments\ndescribed were in fact authorized for the particular students\ninvolved; and second ',,,'as there any truth to the allegation that\nthe spatula spank was used...\n(U-23).\nDr. Daignault conducted an investigation as requested by DMR and based\non his investigation, ultimately concluded that no abuse had occurred, nor was\nthere a violation of the Court-ordered treatment plans. (Tr. 11, 67). That\nd The terms \"mediate\" and \"arbitrate\"were used interchangeably and without\ndistinction by all parties to the Settlement Agreement throughout the course of their\ndealings. The source of any such request was always ParagraphB-2 of the Settlement\nAgreement. Dr. Daignault viewed mediation not only as partof, but indeed the first step\ninthe arbitration process. (Tr. IX, 19-20).\n13\n\ninformation was communicated to Kim Murdock who accepted it without\nquestion. (Ld..).\nApproximately one year later, on January 18, 1991, General Counsel\nMurdock again referred Dr. Daignault another complaint alleging abuse, and\nagain asked Dr. Daignault to investigate the allegation. (1_I-31). Dr. Daignault\nreviewed the matter, spoke with oflicials at JRC, and concluded again that no\nabuse had taken place, nor was the treatment plan violated. (Tr. 11, 73-74).\nAttorney Murdock accepted without question Dr. Daignault's conclusion, fir.\nII, 74-75).\nThe relationship between Dr. Daignault and DMR remained productive\nand collegial at every level until August of 1993. (Tr. II, 190). In response to\na request from Dr. Daiguault under a provision of the Settlement Agreement\nwhich required DMR to provide technical assistance to the Court Monitor upon\nhis request, DMR arranged for a particular psychologist to serve as a DMR\nexpert. (Tr. 1I, 69, U-24). In March of 1993, D,',,IR Deputy General Counsel\nMargaret Chow Menzer sent Dr. Daignault a letter regarding the use ofa DMR\npsychologist to evaluate a particular student. In that letter, Attorney Chow-\nMenzer set forth clearly her understanding of the respective roles that existed\npursuant to the Settlement Agreement. She stated:\nIn my reading of the Settlement Agreement, it is the Court\nMonitor who is responsible for overseeing JRC's treatment and\neducational program and to 'report to the Court concerning any\nissues that he deems necessary relating to the health, safety, or\nwell-being of any JRC client.' The Settlement Agreement\nclearly reflects the understanding of the Court and the signatory\nparties in your ability as the Court appointed monitor to make\nthe threshold determination of whether a JRC treatment program\nis presenting a serious risk to the JRC student. The Agreement\nclearly places the responsibility on you to alert the Court if in\nyour judgment such a risk existed.\n(U-65).\nDuring March of 1993, DMR further acknowledged the restrictions\nimposed by the Settlement Agreement on its actions. At that time, a bill was\npending before the legislature which would prohibit aversive treatment. General\nCounsel Murdock wrote to counsel for JRC noting that the Commissioner wished\n14\n\nto testifyin supportof the bill. (U-67). While the letter expressed the\nCommissioner's strong feelings concerning the bill, it went on to state:\n1advised the Commissioner of my concerns that the Settlement\nAgreement...may be interpreted by some to prohibit him from\ntaking the position on the legislation. As you know, the\nDepartment has historically been neutral on the bill. The\nCommissioner has assured me that it not his intention to violate\na legal obligation.\n(U-67). Despite the fact that the Commissioner had \"strong\" feelings about his\ndesire to testify at the legislative hearing in favor of the bill, he decided not to\ntestify after he received JRC's immediate reply objecting on the ground that such\naction would be inconsistent with the Settlement Agreement and DMR's\nregulations v.'hich permitted the use oeaversives. (Tr. I11, pp.48-50; JRC-254).\nD. DMR's 1991 Certification Recommendation\nFollowing the execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Department of\nMental Health drafted regulations concerning the use of \"Level 111\"procedures,\nwhich included certain aversive procedures utilized at JRC. S_ 104 CMR\n§20.15). Virtually identical regulations were subsequently adopted by the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation. The parties agreed at trial that those\nregulations had been unchanged since they were first instituted. (Tr. 111, 123).\nUnder the DMR regulations, a party utilizing Level III procedures would have\nto be \"certified\" to utilize those procedures.\nJRC received its initial certification in April of 1989 which expired two\nyears later, in April 1991. (U-15). On December 5, 1990, JRC's Director of\nStudent Services wrote to DMR to request a renewal application for certification,\nreminding DMR of the upcoming expiration date. (JRC-270). JRC also\nreminded DMR that itwas using \"shock procedures\" pursuant to court-approved\ntreatment plans. (Tr. VIIA, 9-10). On June 8, 1991, after JRC's certification\nhad technically expired, the Commissioner's designee, Amanda Chalmers,\nresponded by sending a letter to JRC enclosing an application for recertification.\nThe letter stated that upon receiving JRC's recertification application, \"a two-\nperson team would visit your program site to complete the recertification as\n15\n\nrequested.\"(Tr. VIIA, 10;U-32, t). .IRC submitted the application for\nrecertification as requested. (Tr. VIIA, 11; JRC-236). Four months later,\nCommissioner Campbell and General Counsel Murdock finally sent Deputy\nGeneral Counsel George Casey and Dr. Riley as the two-person team to review\nJRC, (the \"1991 Certification Team'). fir. 1, 97,99; Tr. 111,44-45; Tr. VIIA,\n11; U-37). Deputy General Counsel Casey and Dr. Riley were instructed to visit\nand evaluate JRC in order to determine if JRC's treatment program conformed\nto the regulations for certification and to make a recommendation to the\nCommissioner regarding JRC's application for recertification. (Tr. 1, 97-109;\nU-38).\nThe review team conducted an on-site evaluation of JRC on December\n9 and 10, 1991. fir. I, 104-107; U-37, 3). Deputy Counsel Casey conducted\na thorough review of JRC records prior to the visit, including the court-approved\ntreatment plans and related Court decrees '.'.'hich involved the use of the\nSpecialized Food Program and GED among other treatment procedures, the\nminutes of JRC's Human Rights Committee and Peer Review Committee, and\nJRC's training manuals. (Tr. I, 99). During their on-site evaluation of JRC,\nDeputy Counsel Casey and Dr. Riley further reviewed JRC's data collection and\ncharting system, the credentials of the individuals developing Level III treatment\nplans, JRC's Human Rights Committee, JRC personnel files, and the entire case\nfile for one JRC student receiving Level I11 interventions. (Tr. I, 104-\n107,118-119; U-37, 2-3). They also conducted personal interviews, including\nspeaking with JRC's Human Rights Officer, JRC psychologists, Dr. Israel, and\nthe directors of many of JRC's departments, fir. I, 105-107; U-37, 3-4).\nAfter concluding their evaluation, Deputy Counsel Casey and Dr. Rilev\ndrafted a Memorandum to the Commissioner (\"the 1991 Certification Report\")\ncontaining their findings and conclusions regarding the JRC program, which was\nsent to the Commissioner's \"designee,\" Amanda Chalmers. The extensive 1991\nCertification Report, in summary, found that JRC's treatment plans complied\nwith the Orders of the Trial Court and DMR regulations including the behavior\nmodification regulations; that JRC had a high quality staff and training program;\nthat the JRC data collection was thorough; JRC's medical services ',,,'ere adequate;\n16\n\nand JRC's clinical staffwere qualified to implement Level Ill procedures, fir. I,\n109-110; U-37). As a result of their evaluation, Deputy Counsel Casey and\nDr. Riley recommended to the Commissioner in the 1991 Certification Report\nthat JRC be certified to employ Level 111behavior modification programs subject\nto five minor conditions, all relating to the composition and policies of JRC's\nHuman Rights Committee. (Tr. 1, 110-114; U-37, 8; U-75, 1).\nWhen JRC still heard nothing from DMR on its application for\nrecertification four months later, .IRC's counsel wrote to DMR to inquire into the\nstatus of JRC's application. (JRC-271; Tr. VIIA, 13). More than one month\nlater, JRC received a letter dated June 10, 1992, from Amanda Chalmers, the\nCommissioner's designee, which instructed JRC to fulfill five conditions before\nrecertification could be approved. (U-43; Tr. VIIA, 13). The five conditions\nmentioned in Ms. Chalmers' June 10, 1992 letter were the same five conditions\nin the 1991 Certification Report, but Ms. Chalmers' letter did not disclose the\nexistence of the report or the fact that it recommended certification. (U-43).\nIndeed, the existence of the 1991 Certification Report was not revealed to the\nCourt or to any patty until JRC obtained it through discovery in the instant case.\n(Tr. VIIA, 12).\nJRC immediately implemented and satisfied the five conditions and sent\na confirming letter to DMR. (Tr. I, 111-112; Tr. VIIA, 14-15; JRC-272). Five\ndays later, Ms. Chalmers sent JRC a letter which stated that since the time of her\nJune 10, 1992 letter, \"two new behavior programs,\" \"the Specialized Food\nProgram and the GED Program,\" had been brought to her attention, and DMR\nhad assembled a review team which included a nutritionist and a physician \"to\nreturn to BRI with the express purpose of reviewing these two programs.\" (U-\n46; Tr. VIIA, 16). JRC's counsel wroteto DMR Deputy Counsel Chow-Menzer\nprotesting the delay in recertification and reminded her that DMR clinicians had\nbeen evaluating and reporting on Specialized Food and GED programs since\n1991. (Tr. VIIA, 16-17; U-273). Deputy Counsel Chow-Menzer responded by\ndenying knowledge of the contents of the DMR clinicians' evaluations, despite\n17\n\nthefactthatin 1990shehadfiledaDMRclinicianreportwiththeTrialCourt\nwhichrecommendceodntinueudseoftheSpecializeFdoodProgramforoneJRC\nclientbecausoefitspositiveimpact.(Tr.

Dr. Daignault referred\nDeputy Counsel Chow-Menzer to the reports of the DMR clinicians, the decrees\nof the Trial Court from the treatment hearings, and additional materials available\nat JRC all of v,hich documented the use of, and authority for those two treatment\nprograms. (Tr. 11, 102-103). Dr. Daignault invited Deputy Counsel Chow-\nMenzer to call him back if she experienced any problems locating the\ninformation. (Tr. II, 103).\nPreviously, on December 21, 1992, the Commissioner wrote tothe D/',IR\nHuman Rights Advisory Committee in response to its inquiry about JRC's\nSpecialized Food Program, explaining that \"[t]he Department has assembled\nlanother] team _ith the expertise to review this particular Level I11 program.\"\n(Tr. 111, 62-68; Tr. VIIA, 18; U-62, 1). DMR's second review team again\nconsisted of Deputy Counsel Casey and Dr. Riley, in addition to two doctors and\na nutritionist (\"the 1993 Certification Team\"). fir. I, 119-120; U-75, 2). The\npurpose of the second review was strict!y limited to addressing any health and\nsafety issues concerning the GED-4 and tile Specialized Food Program. (Tr. 1,\n120-122). Private opinions of the team members relative to the issue of aversives\nwere not appropriate considerations. (U-75, 10; Tr. I, 136-137). Deputy\nCounsel Casey and Dr. Riley were assigned because they had performed the\noriginal certification review in 1991. (Tr. 1, 120-122).\n18\n\nThe 1993CertificationTeamrequestedandreviewedinformation\nsuppliedbyJRCinadvancoefitsvisittoJRCwhichdidnotoccuruntilMay5,\n1993,almosotneyearafterMs.Chalmer'sletter. (rr. !, 122-123,125U;-75,\n2). The1993Certification Team reviewed extensive documentation while at\nJRC, observed the JRC students, and conducted lengthy interviews with a JRC\npsychologist, JRC's head nurse, and JRC's consulting physician. 03-75,2-3).\nAfter the visit, Deputy Counsel Casey requested and received additional\ninformation from JRC regarding an issue concerning misfires of the GED device.\n(Tr. I, 124-125; JRC-237). Based on this information, Deputy Counsel Casey\nand the 1993 Certification Team concluded that the GED misfires posed no\nhealth or safety risk. fir. I, 133). Following their visit, the 1993 Certification\nTeam drafted and signed \"_a comprehensive report dated July 15, 1993 entitled:\n\"Report of the Certification Team Re: Application of Behavior Research Institute\nfor Level III Behavior Modification Certification\" (the \"1993 Certification\nReport\"), v,'hich was submitted to General Counsel Murdock. (Fr. 1, 132-133;\nU-75). In its report, the 1993 Certification Team concluded that there had been\nno change in the high quality of the JRC program since the 1991 review; that\nJRC was in compliance with all DMR regulations; that there were no adverse\nhealth consequences from the Specialized Food Program or the GED-4 Program\ndue to JRC's meticulous monitoring of the Specialized Food Program; and that\nthe power output on the GED-4 device was extremely low and not harmful.\nfir. I, 127-131; U-75). The 1993 Certification Team tbund no reason to change\nthe previous recommendation that JRC be certified. The report recommended\nthat JRC be certified to employ Level III interventions with two provisions\nregarding future reporting of any problems with the GED-4 and the Specialized\nFood Program. 03-75,11). The Commissioner, however, secreted the 1993\ns The 1993 Certification Report was signed by all members of the team except\nDr. Riley and thereisa footnote in the report which states that Dr. Rile;,' resigned from\nDMR to move to California after he participated inthe May 5, 1993 visit toJRC. (Tr.\n1, 134-135; U-75, 12). Deputy Counsel Casey testified at trial that he and the other team\nmembers considered the 1993Certification Report complete since Dr. Riley participated\ninthe evaluation even though he was not available tosign the final Report.

O'r. I11,52-53; JRC-255). The CBS producer\ninformed the Commissioner that the show might depict DMR as not doing itsjob\nin regulating JRC. (Tr. 111, 53-55). Subsequently, the Commissioner had\nseveral meetings with his supervisor, the Undersecretary of the Executive Oftice\nof Health and Human Services, todiscuss the administration's concerns about the\nupcoming CBS program and how it might negatively depict DMR and the\nadministration as not properly regulating JRC. fir. 111,56-59).\nShortly after learning of the CBS program, the Commissioner abruptly\nreversed the posture DMR had taken for the previous six years and maintained\nthat DMR was not a party to the Settlement Agreement. Therefore, from at least\nAugust, 1993 up to the time of trial, the Commissioner's actions were based on\nhis new-found position that DMR was not subject to the mandates of the\nSettlement Agreement. (Tr. III, 16-18; Tr. IV, 172).\nThe Commissioner was challenged on his change of position at the trial.\nHe acknowledged on cross-examination that he had read the Settlement\nAgreement at the time he was appointed Commissioner, and he admitted that the\nletters his various counsel sent prior to August, 1993 to third parties, as well as\nDMR's legal position in the McKni_ht case were completely inconsistent with the\nposition he adopted in the summer of 1993 -- that DMR was not a party to the\nSettlement Agreement. (Tr. 111, 14,22-23,27-30). He further testified that in\nMarch of 1993, when he asked JRC for permission to testify before the\nlegislature, he was \"not sure\" if DMR was a party to the Settlement Agreement,\n20\n\nbutthen,laterthatsummer,hedecidedthatDMR wasnota partyto the\nSettlemenAtgreement. (Tr. I11,48; Tr. IV, 171).\nThe Commissioner testified that when it was first brought to his attention\nthat DMR was not a party to the Settlement Agreement, he suggested that DMR\ntake some legal action with the Trial Court to ask for clarification, but no\nclarification was sought. (Tr. IV, 173). He also said he asked for clarification\nand/or consultation with the Attorney General's office, but he did not make a\nwritten request or take any formal legal steps to determine whether DMR was\nbound by the Agreement. fir. IV, 175,212). The Commissioner also never\nnotified the Trial Court of this new legal position, and it was not included when\nhis counsel filed a comprehensive (but false) Report to the Court concerning\nDMR's regulation of JRC in September of 1993. (App. 147-182). (DMR's\nReport to the Court is set forth in more detail infra). Other than the\nCommissioner's concern for how DMR would be depicted in the upcoming CBS\nprogram, no other explanation is evident for his sudden change of position.\nF. The August 6. 1993 Letter\nOn August 6, 1993, three weeks after the Commissioner received the\ncompleted 1993 Certification Report, v,'hich he never released and which praised\nthe JRC program and recommended certification, he sent a letter (the \"August 6\nLetter\") to Dr. Israel advising him of DMR's \"interim\" decision on JRC's\napplication for recertification. (U-82). This was the first time JRC had received\ncorrespondence directly from the Commissioner concerning an application tbr\ncertification. Previous correspondence and regulatory decisions on certification\ndating back to .IRC's first application for certification in 1988, were signed and\nsent by Amanda Chalmers, General Counsel Murdock, or one of DMR's Deputy\nGeneral Counsel. (U-15; U-32; U-34; U-43; U.-46).\nThe thrust of the August 6 Letter was that JRC had engaged in\n\"continued and repeated non-compliance with DMR regulations,\" despite the\n1993 certification team's contrary finding. (U-82,1). The Commissioner slated\nthat he would only grant JRC twenty-five days of interim certification to use\nLevel 111 intervention allegedly because: /RC was not fully complying with\n21\n\nDMR'sregulationsJ;RC'streatmenptlanswere not in compliance with DMR's\nbehavior modification regulations; DMR had not reviewed how JRC implemented\nits Level 111procedures; and DMR had no evidence that JRC's GED, Specialized\nFood and other aversive interventions were professionally acceptable, effective,\nand in compliance with the regulations. (U-82,1-5). The Commissioner's own\nattorney, Deputy Counsel Casey, testified at trial that the statements in the\nCommissioner's letter were false based upon the evaluation done by the 1993\nCertification Team. fir. 1, 142-147,153-160).\nThe Commissioner's August 6 Letter was issued based upon his new\nposition that DMR was not a party to the Settlement Agreement. (Tr. 11I, 16-\n17). Accompanying the letter was a copy of a letter signed by a Dr. Paul Jansen\ndated August 1, 1993 (the \"Jansen Letter\") criticizing almost every aspect of\nJRC's program. (U-82, 4). Simultaneous with sending Dr. Israel the August 6\nLetter and the Jansen Letter, the Commissioner also sent the Jansen Letter to the\nDisabled Persons Protection Commission. _ ('DPPC\"). In his letter to the\nDPPC, the Commissioner stated that the Jansen Letter \"sets forth sufficient facts\nto support a reasonable belief that the JRC students are being subject to abuse.\"\n(U-81). The Commissioner did not send the Jansen Letter to Dr. Daignault for\ninvestigation, nor did he investigate or otherwise substantiate the allegations in\nthe Jansen Letter, despite knowing that Dr. Jansen regularly testified in the Trial\nCourt's treatment hearings in opposition to JRC's treatment. (Tr. 11,96-97, 121-\n122; Tr. VI, 104). Deputy Counsel Casey testified at trial that he saw nothing\nat JRC during his 1993 visit which would have required him to file an abuse\ncomplaint against JRC. (Tr. I, 128,131-140).\nThe twenty-five days of interim certification granted by the\nCommissioner in the August 6 Letter, and the possibility of a second twenty-five\nday extension, were conditional on JRC's providing to DMR in twenty-one days\na list of items, including the following: evidence that JRC's treatment is\nprofessionally acceptable; a list of all aversives actually in use at JRC; a sample\n6 The Disabled Persons Protection Commission is a state agency that conducts\ninvestigations of allegations of abuse against disabled individuals.

(Tr. VI, 104).\nThe Commissioner could not give any credible explanation at trial for the\ndiscrepancies between the allegations he made in the August 6 Letter and the\nfindings inthe 1993 Certification Report dated just three weeks earlier, fir. I11,\n98-99,102-105). When confronted with the 1993 Certification Report at trial, the\nCommissioner attempted to justify his actions by claiming that he did not\nconsider the report to be \"complete.\" fir. III, 78-79). However, he conceded\nthat h_. never informed the members of the 1993 Certification Team that their\nreport was incomplete, and he never solicited any additional information from,\nor even spoke with any member of the 1993 Certification Team. He also used\nselected parts of the \"incomplete\" 1993 Certification Report as the basis for his\ndecision in the August 6 Letter. fir. I11, 78-82). Deputy Counsel Casey also\nundercut the Commissioner's position when he testified that he considered the\n1993 Certification Report to be complete when he submitted it to General\nCounsel Murdock for the Commissioner, and that he was never asked to perform\nany more work on JRC's Application for Recertification the report was\nsubmitted, fir. I, 131-140).\n23\n\nThe August 6 Letter came as a complete surprise to JRC, which had not\nreceived any prior notice from the Commissioner about either regulatory\ndeficiencies, or the alleged professional unacceptability and lack of effectiveness\nof JRC's treatments. (Tr. I11, 107,109). Indeed, JRC's treatment plans in 1993\nwere the same in form and content as in 1989, when DMR reviewed JRC's\nsample treatment plan and granted JRC's first certification, fir. VIIA, 39; JRC-\n274). DMR's behavior modification regulations also had not changed since\n1988. (Tr. 11t, 123-124).\nThe Commissioner admitted at trial that he was aware on August 6, 1993\nthat the DMR clinicians had written favorable reports from 1987 through 1993\non JRC's treatment programs and procedures, and he was aware that the Trial\nCourt had held numerous evidentiary hearings and had issued findings on the\nprofessional acceptability and effectiveness of JRC's treatment. Yet he chose not\nto consult the DMR clinicians nor mention their reports in his August 6 Letter.\n(JRC-240,8; JRC-244,10; Tr. lll, 37-41,110-111). Significantly, the\nCommissioner conceded that the findings of the Trial Court, the DMR Clinicians'\nevaluations, and the findings of the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports were all\nrelevant to his decision on certification, yet his August 6 Letter contradicted\nthose exact sources. (ft. 111, 43,71,72). Furthermore, Commissioner\nCampbell's August 6 Letter alleged a problem involving misfires with the GED\ndevice. (U-82,3). Yet he failed to disclose that the issue of misfires had already\nbeen addressed and determined not to be a problem at a contested evidentiary\nhearing before the Trial Court in 1992 in which DMR chose not to participate.\n(JRC-240,3-8). Likewise, Deputy Counsel Casey testified that the 1993\nCertification Team had in fact concluded that misfires did not present any health\nor safety concerns, fir. 1, 152-153).\nThe Commissioner's August 6 Letter was a blatant attempt to portray\nJRC falsely and in a negative light. As described by his own counsel, the letter\ncontained numerous untruths and failed to include material facts, fir. I, 143-\n160). For example, the letter mischaracterized certain findings of the\nCertification Team and omitted other material aspects, most particularly, that the\nTeam had recommended certification. (U-75,11). The Letter created the overall\n24\n\nimpression that JRC had failed to cooperate in the certification process and was\nout of compliance with DMR regulations. The likely affect, if the Commissioner\nreleased the letter to third parties, was nothing less than obliteration of JRC's\nrelationship with its funding and placement agencies and with the parents of its\nstudents. And that is exactly what he did. The Commissioner testified at trial\nthat he considered advising the Court Monitor of his actions in advance of the\nAugust 6 Letter, but decided against it. (Tr. 111, 31,35-36). Instead, he\ndisseminated the Letter not only to JRC, but to also all of JRC's funding\nagencies, as well as JRC parents. (U-82). Indeed, the Commissioner admitted\nat trial that he would have serious concerns about placing a student at a school\nthat was the subject of a letter such as the August 6, 1993 certification letter\nregarding JRC. (Tr. 111, 129-130).\nG. The Commissioner's Refusal To Mediate, The August 31st\nCertification Letter, And The Attack Upon The Court Monitor\nIn response to the August 6, 1993 Letter, JRC requested mediation under\nParagraph B-2 of the Settlement Agreement. (JRC-245; JRC-246; U-84; Tr. I1,\n123,124). Dr. Israel firmly believed that the letter threatened the financial\nviability of the program and the availability of JRC's life-sustaining treatment for\nits students, fir. VIIA, 33-34). JRC's funding and placement agencies could\nnot place students, nor allow students to remain in a program that had only a 25\nday license to offer treatment, and had been accused of a serious regulatory\nviolations as set forth in the August 6 Letter. fir. VIIA, 33-34). Contrary to\nDMR's position in past years, the Commissioner refused to mediate. (Tr. VIIA,\n32, 137-139; Tr. VI, 85-86).\nAs a result, on August 27, 1993, JRC's counsel sent a written request for\narbitration directly to Attorney General Scott Harshbarger. (JRC-246). In the\nletter, JRC counsel provided a brief history of the litigation between JRC and the\nCommonwealth dating back to 1985, described the purpose and meaning of the\nSettlement Agreement and its dispute resolution provision, and informed the\nAttorney General that the Commissioner took the position that he had no\nobligation to arbitrate the August 6, 1993 certification decision. (JRC-246).\nJRC counsel concluded his letter by noting that the arbitration provision of the\n25\n\nSettlemenAtgreemenhtadworkedwellsince1987stating,\"lWlehaveavoided\nthetypeof litigationweexperienceidn themid 1980'swhichwassotime\nconsuminge,xpensivaendpainfultoallpartiesm, ostespeciallytheparentsof\nthedisabledchildren.\"(JRC-246)A. nAssistanAtttorneyGenerarlespondetdo\nJRC'srequest for arbitration as follows: \"In any event, as we discussed on the\nphone yesterday, the historical understanding of the Settlement Agreement -\nincluding in this office - is not what your letter sets forth.\" (U-90).\nDespite DMR's refusal to arbitrate, JRC complied with the August 6\nLetter and sent to the Commissioner, within twenty-one days, all of the\nintbrmation requested. (DMR-17; Tr. VIIA, 34). The Commissioner's August 6\nLetter and the Jansen Letter criticized and sought justification for every aspect\nof JRC's program, and it required Dr. Israel and fifteen of his top level staff to\nwork full time for three weeks to complete the response. (Tr. VIIA, 36-37; U-\n81; U-82). The responsive letter to the Commissioner was fifty-two pages in\nlength, contained a point by point refutation of the false allegations, and included\nthree cubic feet of exhibits. (Tr. VIIA, 35). As requested, JRC submitted with\nits response to the August 6 Letter another sample treatment plan, and again\nsubmitted the most recent version of a court-approved treatment plan, which was\nconsistent with the treatment plan previously approved by DMR as part of JRC's\n1989 Certification. (Tr. VIIA, 39; JRC-274).\nRather than retracting the allegations or mediating the dispute, the\nCommissioner sent Dr. Israel another \"interim\" certification decision on\nAugust 31, 1993 (the \"August 31 Letter'). The August 31 Letter granted JRC\nonly another twenty-five days of certification, subject to even more alarming\nconditions. The August 31 Letter alleged that JRC was in violation of additional\nstate regulations. (U-91). The Commissioner ordered JRC to terminate using\nall aversive treatments which were not in use at JRC as of August, 1993, even\nthough additional aversives procedures had been approved by the Trial Court as\npart of outstanding substituted judgement treatment plans. (Tr. I11 141-146; U-\n91, 3). The Commissioner also informed JRC that it would be subject to yet\nanother evaluation as part of the certification process this time by an\n\"independent\" group to be chosen by the Commissioner. (U-91, 4).\n26\n\nAnotheorftheCommissionerc'sonditionsC,ondition10,requiredJRC\ntonotifyallofitsfundingandplacemenatgencietsoestablishwithinsixtydays\nanalternativeavailableplacemenfotreveryclientplacedatJRCshouldJRCbe\nunabletoprovidethestudenwt ith services.03-91,5; Tr. 11,140).

VIIA,50-51).\nAt trial, the Commissioner attempted to justify Condition 10 as a\nlegitimate exercise of regulatory authority because JRC had in the past\nsupposedly unexpectedly discharged a client. (Tr. I11, 151). When pressed on\ncross-examination, the Commissioner could only identify one situation involving\na discharge which occurred in 1991, and he could not explain why this condition\nwas imposed in 1993 for an event which occurred two years earlier. (Tr. 111,p.\n151). The Commissioner also admitted that he had never before imposed the\nemergency placement condition on any other DMR licensed program. (Ft. 111,\n154; Tr. VI, 107).\nhe Commissioner also falsely stated in his August 31 Letter that JRC\nhad failed to report to DMR past problems with misfires of the GED, and that\nJRC had continually and repeatedly failed to comply with the Human Rights\nCommittee regulations, fir. VI, 105-106; U-91, 1-2). Deputy Counsel Casey\ntestified at trial that itwas JRC that informed him of the issue of misfires, (Ft. I,\n166-167,176), and that the Commissioner's statement that JRC had violated\nDMR's Human Rights Committee regulations was false. (Tr. I, 170). JRC\nagain requested mediation of the August 31 Letter under Paragraph B-2 of the\nSettlement Agreement and the Commissioner again refused. (Tr. VIIA, 53-55;\nJRC-247; U-98; U-96).\nAt the same time the Commissioner was refusing to mediate under the\nSettlement Agreement, he also launched a series of attacks on the Court Monitor.\nOn August 19, 1993, DMR counsel sent a letter to Dr. Daignault raising\n27\n\nconcernasboutDr.Daignaulptrovidingforensicevaluationfsorother clients of\nJRC's counsel's law firm, and requesting copies of Dr. Daignault's billings to the\nTrial Court for his services as Court Monitor. (Tr. Ill, 155-157; U-85). The\nCommissioner admitted at trial that he had no reason to believe that Dr.\nDaignault was biased in any way and that he knew Dr. Daignault had a similar\nrelationship with DMR because he had provided forensic consulting services to\nDMR. (Tr. III, 157-158). He \"guessed\" that the ethical attack on the Court\nMonitor was simply coincidental with his refusal to engage in mediation. (Tr.\n111,157).\nOn September 2, 1993, JRC filed the original contempt complaint\nbecause the Commissioner had refused to engage in arbitration, ordered JRC to\nstop using important treatment that had been approved by the Trial Court, and\nmade false statements about the imposed conditions in his certification letters of\nAugust 6 and August 10 that were threatening the financial viability of JRC.\n(S.A. 27,86-95; Tr, VIIA, 49).\nFollowing the filing of the Complaint, Dr. Daignault sent a v,,ritten\nrequest to DMR counsel to arbitrate under the Settlement Agreement, stating:\nIn accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Paragraph B-2, in\nthis case, I and 13ettina Briggs, Esq., Guardian A__.dL.ditem, are\nwriting to invite and request )'our participation in a meeting to\naddress the issues arising from the Complaint dated 9-2-93 filed\nby Behavior Research Institute against the Department of Mental\nRetardation. As you know, the Settlement Agreement requires\nthat the Court Monitor 'shall arbitrate any disputes between the\nparties' after which, if any party isaggrieved, the matter shall be\nsubmitted to the Court for resolution.\n(Tr. 11, 143; 1RC-248). On September 17, 1993, General Counsel Murdock\nwrote to Dr. Daignault to inform him that DMR had already agreed to meet with\nJRC directly but would meet with JRC \"with others present, including )'ourself.\"\nShe further stated:\nAs you know, the Department of Mental Retardation does not\nagree that the Settlement Agreement's provisions concerning the\nmonitor contemplated the monitor's arbitration of disputes such\nas those alleged in 13Rl's recent court filing, nor the attendant\nresolutionby a Probate Court referenced in your letter. [citation\nomitted]. Our attendance on Monday therefore is not to be\n28\n\nconstrueadsanywaiverof any position set forth in our papers\nin this matter. BRI's attorney has agreed that our attendance\nwould not be taken as such as waiver.\n(Tr. II, 145-146, U-98). DMR's counsel confirmed in a letter to JRC's counsel,\nprior to the meeting with the Court Monitor, that: \"We are simply meeting to\ndiscuss matters in order to reach agreement on whatever issues can be resolved.\"\n03-96).\nA meeting between Dr. Israel and JRC's counsel, DMR Counsel, Dr.\nDaignault, GAL Briggs and others took place on September 20, 1993. fir. II,\n146..147; Tr. VIIA, 56). DMR representatives maintained their position at the\nmeeting that the Commissioner was not required to arbitrate disputes with the\nCourt Monitor. fir. I1, 148-150; Tr. VIIA, 56). Nevertheless, extensive\ndiscussions ensued concerning Condition 10 after JRC representatives pressed\nupon DMR their serious concern about the impact of that Condition on JRC's\nparents and funding and placement agencies. DMR representatives tentatively\nagreed to change the emergency placement condition in the August 31 Letter\nsubject to the Commissioner's approval. Pursuant to this agreement, JRC would\nnot have to notify all of its funding and placement agencies as originally ordered,\nbut rather would inquire about each agency's emergency services at the next\nregularly scheduled yearly service plan meeting for each student, fir. II, 148-\n150,154-155; Tr. VIIA, 56).\nOn September 21, 1993, DMR's counsel confirmed to JRC in writing\nthat the Commis_io,ler would agree to change the condition on emergency\nplacements. 03-99). However, two days later, DMR repudiated the Agreement\nand informed JRC that the Commissioner planned to send copies of the August 6\nLetter and the August 31 Letter (collectively, the 'August Certification Letters')\nto all of JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies and the JRC parents.\n,'Tr. VIIA, 57; U-102; U-103). The mailing of the August 31 Letter, without\nreferencing the negotiated agreement which was reached on September 20,\ncompletely undermined the agreement because it would cause the very harm\nwhich the agreement sought to prevent -- notifying funding and placement\nagencies of the need for a plan of emergency placements. (Tr. !1, 157-158).\n29\n\nPriortotheCommissioners'sendingtheseletters,JRCcounseilnformed\nDMRcounseilnwritingthatJRCobjected to the dissemination of the August\nCertification Letters, and again requested mediation under the Settlement\nAgreement before the letters were sent. (Tr. VIIA, 57-58; JRC-249). JRC\ncounsel also intbrmed DMR that JRC considered the August Certification Letters\nto contain false and defamatory statements about JRC, and, if published to the\nfunding and placement agencies, would cause grievous harm to JRC and its\nstudents, especially the emergency placement requirement contained in Condition\n10 of the August 31 Letter. fir. VIIA, 57-58; JRC-249). Dr. Daignault and\nGAL Briggs implored Commissioner's General Counsel not to send out copies\nof the August Certification Letters and to mediate the issue. General Counsel\nMurdock responded that \"DMR is not willing to negotiate with BRI the language\nof a letter sent by the Commissioner of Mental Retardation to his counterparts\nin other states. DMR can see no point (except delay) in meeting to discuss this\nfurther.\" (U-103,2). One of the reasons given by General Counset Murdock for\nrefusing to arbitrate and to publish the August Certification Letters, was the\nCommissioner's claim that itwas \"not appropriate for us to withhold information\nfrom our sister agencies during this period .... \" (U-103, 1). Ironically, the\nCommissioner withheld the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports from JRC's\nfunding and placement agencies. (Tr. III, 171-173). The Commissioner also\nnever substantiated the allegations in the Jansen Letter before sending copies of\nit to all of JRC's funding and placement Agencies. (Tr. Ill, 172-177).\nOn September 24, 1993, the Commissioner sent copies of the August\nCertification Letters and the unsubstantiated Jansen Letter to all of JRC's funding\nand placement agencies without informing them that the emergency placement\ncondition in the August 31 Letter had been rescinded. (Tr. !I, 160-163; Tr. I11,\n129,162-168,170-171; U-102; U-103; U-104; U-105). On September 24, 1993,\nDr. Daignault reported to the Trial Court that arbitration under the Settlement\nAgreement had failed because the Commissioner had refused to arbitrate and had\nsent the August Certification Letters to JRC's funding and placement agencies.\n(Tr. II, 167-168; JRC-250).\n30\n\nH. TheSeptembe2r2, 1993DMR\"ReportToTheCourt\"\nOnSeptembe2r2, 1993,the Commissioner filed an unsolicited \"Report\nTo The Court\" concerning the status of JRC. (App. 147). The 28 page\ndocument purported to summarize in detail the basis for DMR's action as of that\ndate, as well as JRC's alleged violations of various regulations. The report was\naccompanied by a voluminous exhibit binder referencing regulatory reports --\ngoing back as far as April 9, 1991 -- concerning various actions undertaken by\nDMR.\nThe report filed by DMR, which was unsigned but attached to a cover\nletter dated September 21, 1993 signed by General Counsel Murdock (JRC-256),\ncontained blatant false statements and material omissions. (App. 147-182). The\nCommissioner reviewed the report before itwas submitted. (Tr. Ill, 178). First,\nthe Report purported to summarize the work of the Certification Team, but did\nso in a completely misleading manner. Fo' example, it stated on page 6 that the\nfield information, which the Commissioner acknowledged was the report of the\n1993 Certification Team, included a recommendation for \"further review\" by the\nCommissioner. (App. 157). Yet, the actual 1993 Certification Report made no\nsuch recommendation. Deputy Counsel Casey also testified that his team never\nrecommended further review by the Commissioner in the 1993 Certification\nReport. (Tr. il, pp.14-15). Despite including 20 exhibits with the Report to the\nCourt, DMR never provided the Court with either the laudatory 1991 and 1993\nCertification Reports. (Tr. 111, 181-182; App. 180-182). The Commissioner\nadmitted at trial that the Report to the Court had misstated the results of the 1991\nand 1993 Certification Reports and did not disclose to the Trial Court that the\nCertification Reports recommended that JRC be certified. (Tr. II, pp.178-183;\nTr. VI, pp.102-103).\nThe Report also falsely characterized the initial part of the certification\nreview. Specifically, the Report stated, \"the initial review resulted in a\ndetermination that JRC was not in compliance with the rules regarding its Human\nRights Committee...\" (App. 157). That characterization to the Court was\ncompletely misleading. The initial review had, in fact, recommended\ncertification of JRC subject to five conditions, all of which attorney Casey\n31\n\ntestifiedwere\"minor.\" fir. 11,15). Moreover, those conditions had been\nsatisfied at the time of the review in May 1993 by the second Certification Team.\n(U-75,1). Attorney Casey testified that the description of the initial review in the\nreport was inaccurate, fir. Ill, 13). The Commissioner testified that he was\naware at the time the report was submitted that the initial reviewing team had\nrecommended certification. He could not explain the false statement contained\nin the Report to the Court. (Tr. III, 179-180).\nI. The September 24. 1993 Interim q'¢rtifiqation De¢isiotl\nOn September 24, 1993, the Commissioner sent JRC another certification\nletter, this time indicating that certification would be conditionally granted until\nDecember 15, 1993, (\"the September 24 Letter\"). (Tr. 111, 186; Tr. VIIA, 61;\nU-106). In this communication, which was also sent to JRC's funding and\nplacement agencies on October 4, 1993, the Commissioner announced that there\nwere a number of abuse investigations which were in process arising from\ncomplaints by former JRC stall', present JRC clients, and their attorneys. The\nletter went on to state that the \"allegations are quite serious on their face, and\ninclude claims that you [Dr. Israel] were personally were involved in, or were\npersonally responsible for, abuse against specific JRC clients.\" (U-106,1). The\nCommissioner's communication of unsubstantiated abuse investigations to third\nparties was a blatant departure from established DMR practice, as the\nCommissioner admitted. (Tr. III, 188-189). Indeed, even though this letter\naccused Dr. Israel personally of committing abuse, the Commissioner did not\nallow Dr. Israel any opportunity to answer the allegations before disseminating\nthem to all of JRC's funding agencies. (Tr. VIIA, 63-64). The Commissioner\nwas compelled to concede in his testimony that the allegations of abuse against\nDr. Israel, personally, were ultimately investigated and not substantiated, frr.\nIll, 192-193). He also admitted that once he found out that the charges were\nunsubstantiated, he did not bother to apprise JRC's funding and placement\nagencies of that significant fact. (Tr. Ill, 191-193). Instead, he allowed the false\ncharges to perpetuate. The Commissioner openly admitted at trial that if he\npersonally had received such a letter such as his September 24, 1993 letter\n32\n\ncontainingseriousallegationsagainsttheheadof a school,he wouldbe\nconcerneadboutplacingclientsinthatprogram,fir. I11,187-188).\nOnpage4oftheSeptembe2r4Letter,theCommissionererquiredthat\nJRC,asaconditionofthisinterimcertificationp,rovideDMRwith*_\n_\" whichhadoccurred since 1989 \"by October 5, 1993.\" ((U-106, 4).\n(emphasis in original). That sentence was underlined in the letter and implied\nthat clients had died at the JRC program without any report to state licensing\nagencies. The significance of that allegation became evident later.\nJ. DMR's \"Independent\" Evaluation And The Continued Attacks\nQn Thg Monitor\nThe Commissioner stated in his August 31 Letter that a new evaluation\nof JRC would be conducted by an \"independent\" group. (U-92-4). However,\nthe Commissioner retained a group called Rivendell to conduct the review of\nJRC, even though DMR knew that Rivendell's co-leader, Dr. Richa\"d Amado\nhad previously taken a strong position against JRC's treatment methods. Dr.\nAmado was the first signatory on a letter to Amnesty International referencing\nJRC's program, entitled \"A Call to Action,\" which sought a ban on all aversive\nprocedures, (U-72,7,9). The letter equated aversives with political torture,\nstating that treatment procedures such as those used at JRC \"would not be\ntolerated if used on prisoners or even animals.\" (U-72,8). The attachments\naccompanying the Call for Action made specific references to JRC, including\nallegations that the Executive Director had mistreated clients stating, \"He had\n\"killed two, choked one with a heart attack (sic) and then one with a strangle\nhold. Everything is so hush hush.\" (U-72,3; Tr. VIIA, 78-79; Tr. X, 169).\nThe process which resulted in the selection of Rivendell not only was\nsuspect from the outset, but also violated Commonwealth policy. DMR issued\na request for proposals (\"RFP\") dated August 30, 1993, seeking bids from\nqualified agencies to review JRC. (U-88). The RFP, however, was circulated\nonly to a limited number of select agencies who were given only ten days\n(instead of the customary 30 days) to respond. The ten day response time was\neffectively seven days since it also included the Labor Day holiday weekend.\n(Tr.

However, she\nadmitted on cross-examination that she had not read the 1991 and 1993\nCertification Reports when the recommendation was made, and she was not even\naware of the 1993 Certification Report until the time of her deposition in 1995.\nfir. X, 136-147).\nRivendell was one of two bids received by DMR by the ten-day deadline.\nDMR chose Rivendell, even though the price of the other bidder, Fidura, was\nalmost half the price of Rivendell's bid. (Tr. X, 173). Dr. Cerreto testified that\nshe rejected Fidura's bid in part because Fidura's bid had a contingency that their\nreport could only be used for regulatory purposes, and Dr. Cerreto wanted a\nreview team with \"experience with the stringencies of Court reporting and\ntestimony.\" fir. X, 173-177; JRC-306). Dr. Cerreto already knew that any\nevaluators selected would need to testify inthe future on behalf of DMR in court,\n34\n\neventhoughtheevaluationwaSsupposedto be independenatndnot pre-\ndetermined0...d•.)•\nAfter the Commissioner informed JR(] that Rivendell would be\nconducting the \"independent\" evaluation, JRC requested a copy of Rivendell's\nresponse to the RFP and copies of the resumes of the members of the Rivendell\nteam. (rr. X, 178-179; Tr. VIIA, 75-77; U-120; JRC-309; JRC-277). DMR\nand Rivendell refused to provide JRC with resumes. 03-122; JRC-277). Deputy\nCounsel Chow-Menzer sent JRC's counsel enclosing what she purported to be\nRivendell's response to the RFP. (JRC-308). However, the document she\nactually sent to counsel was a sanitized version of Rivendell's original response.\nIt omitted Rivendell's bid price, which was higher then Fidura's, omitted\nRivendell's statement that the short ten-day deadline in the RFP \"made it\nimpossible\" for Rivendell to assemble a \"qualified team,\" and omitted the name\nof Rivendell team member Hank Bersani, who was also a well-known anti-\naversive advocate, fir. X, 177-178; Tr. XI, 61; JRC-310; JRC-308).\nNevertheless, JRC obtained information from other sources which raised\nconcerns that Rivendell team members were hardly \"unbiased and independent\"\nbut were in fact firmly opposed from the outset to the types of treatment used at\nJRC. (Tr. VIIA, 77-79). JRC submitted all of the information on the issue of\nRivendell's bias to the Trial Court in a motion dated December 19, 1993, and\nsent the motion to DMR with a request for mediation under the Settlement\nAgreement regarding the selection of Rivendell, and all the other outstanding\ndisputes between JRC and DMR. (Tr. VIIA, 79-82; JRC-279). DMR's counsel\nresponded to JRC's request by refusing to mediate stating, \"In any event, our\nposition on the matter of mediation has been stated to you many times. The\nSettlement Agreement only contemplates mediation of disputes regarding a BRI\nstudent's placemert or treatment.\" 03-124).\nAlthough DMR refused to arbitrate under the Settlement Agreement,\nGeneral Counsel Murdock commented on the information uncovered by IRC on\nRivendell in a letter dated December 10, 1993: \"[W]e are appalled by the\nmaterial in your Memorandum and have aSked Rivendell for an immediate\nresponsetotheallegationscontainedtherein.\" 03-127,2). Shealso claimed that\n35\n\nDMR wasnotawareof Rivendell's background because DMR did not do\n\"background checks.\" lflflflflflCfloflmflmflfilsfslifolfnleflrflflflC(_a.m).pbell contradicted this account,\nhowever, when he testified that his staff undertook efforts to determine that\nRivendell was not biased, but admitted that he in fact had been aware that Dr.\nAmado signed the Call to Action. fir. Ill, 187). Dr. Cerreto and the\nCommissioner maintained at trial that Rivendell was not biased despite the Call\nto Action and despite a letter that Dr. Cerreto received from Rivendell's\npresident dated December 1, 1993, (before Rivendell performed the evaluation\nof JRC), in which he describes Dr. Israel's views on aversives as \"out of\nbalance.\" (JRC-311; Tr. XI, 25). Dr. Cerreto testified that knowing in advance\nthat the president of Rivendell believed Dr. Israel's views on treatment were \"out\nof balance\" did not mean there was a bias against JRC. (Tr. I11, 197-198;\nTr. VI, 138-139; Tr. XI, 19,20,25; JRC-311). On March 2, 1994, DMR\nnotified JRC that the \"independent\" review would be conducted by Rivendell and\nthat JRC's objections to Rivendell and the materials provided on Rivendell's bias\nwere \"irrelevant.\" fir. VIIA, 103; U-147, 2). Not surprisingly, the Rivendell\nteam was highly critical of the JRC program. (DMR-2).\nDMR's refusal to mediate the Rivendell issue with the Monitor cannot\nbe explained in light of its actions two months before, when DMR specifically\nsought the Court Monitor's approval for the Rivendell review. By letter dated\nOctober 19, 1993, General Counsel Kim Murdock wrote to Dr. Daignault\nrequesting the Court Monitor's \"approval of the independent program review\nrequired as a condition to JRC's interim certification.\" The letter went on to\nassert that \"such approval will both speed the certification process and remove\nan issue which JRC had unnecessarily placed before the Court.\" (U-II0).\nAttorney Murdock's letter of October 14, 1993 was sent less than one month\nafter she and Commissioner had specifically rejected further attempts of\nmediation by the Court Monitor concerning the mailing of the August 6 and\nAugust 31, 1993 letters. (JRC-245; U-96). Accordingly, the Court /',tonitor\nresponded to Attorney Murdock on October 15, 1993, via facsimile, reminding\nher of DMR's refusal to participate in the mediation s,'.ssions. (JRC-251). He\nfurther advised Attorney Murdock that he did not see how mediation could be\n36\n\nreinstitutedunlesstheDepartmenwtere to revise its position, and make an\nunequivocal commitment to the process of mediation with \"the full\nacknowledgment that the Settlement Agreement mandates the submission of any\nissue to the Colart which fails to be resolved in mediation.\" 0__d.). Moreover,\nDr. Daignault weighed the request that he \"approve\" Rivendell in light of his role\nunder the Settlement Agreement. He concluded that the Settlement Agreement\ndid not give him the authority to approve actions, since his role was to mediate\nand arbitrate disputes. (Tr. II, 171; JRC-251).\nWhen DMR did not receive the answer it wanted, the agency responded\nby continuing its attack on the Court Monitor. The same day that Dr. Daignault\nfaxed his letter to General Counsel Murdock, DMR noticed Dr. Daignault's\ndeposition in this case. (U-l ll). The notice of deposition constituted an\nescalation of the personal attack which was being conducted by the Department\nagainst Dr. Daignault. This was evidenced in a October 19, 1993 letter the\nDepartment sent to Dr. Daignault requesting that he \"reconsider\" his role as\nMonitor, at least as a matter of conscience.\" (U-113). Dr. Daignault testified\nthat he felt this letter was further evidence of DMR's campaign to impugn him\nand that after years of collegiality, he felt badly that the Department would\n\"stoop\" to this level. Or. I1, 174).\nOn October 22, 1993, Dr. Daignault filed a motion seeking reassignment\nof his arbitration and mediation responsibilities under Paragraph B-2, because he\nfelt that the Commissioner's challenge to his ethical integrity, although frivolous,\nwas an attempt by DMR to divert attention away from the matters involving\nDMR, JRC, the JRC students, and the JRC parents. (Tr. 11, 176-117; JRC-252;\nApp. 183-184). The Trial Court subsequently appointed counsel for the Monitor\nand appointed the Honorable George Hurd, as the new mediator in this matter.\n(App. 213; Tr. II, 180). Dr. Daignault having withdrawn from his mediating\nfunction, continued inhis role under the Settlement Agreement to monitor JRC's\ncompliance with state regulations.\nK. The Tuesday Mornine Meetings\nIn the late spring of early fall of 1993, the Commissioner convened a\nspecial JRC meeting, which became known within DMR as the \"Tuesday\n37\n\nmorningmeetingso\"r \"weekly meetings.\" These meetings began after the\nCommissioner initially received the inquiry from CBS News. fir. 111203-\n204,207). The Commissioner never held meeting such as these with respect to\nany other provider. (Tr. III, 200). DMR's staff for these meetings included,\namong others, the Director of Investigations, Richard Cohen; Public Relations\nDirector, Jerry Ryan; DMR's General Counsel Murdock; and a private attorney\nfrom Philadelphia, David Ferleger, Esquire, hired by the Commissioner with\npublic funds to work with him on JRC's application for recertification. (Tr. 111,\n200-201). The Commissioner did not invite the members of the 1993\nCertification Team to the Tuesday morning meetings, nor did he discuss with,\nor provide copies of the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports to the group, fir.\nI11, 74-89). The 1993 Certification Team was not involved in any way in the\nweekly meetings.\nThe Commissioner initially testified at trial, and at his pre-trial\ndeposition, that these Tuesday morning meetings dealt \"strictly\" with the issue\nof JRC's certification and that there was no other purpose to, or issues discussed\nat the meetings except certification, fir. 111,72,199-200,203,214; Tr. IV, 120-\n121). The members of the group kept notes, work plans and agendas for the\nweekly meetings. (13-193; U-225). DMR counsel, however, did not produce\ncopies of the notes, work plans, and agendas until the week before trial, and even\nthen, the copies were heavily redacted with the words \"privileged\" and \"policy\ndevelopment\" boldly stated on the top of each document. (U-190-U-225; Tr.\nXlll 28-31).\nOn July 11, 1993, the Trial Court conducted an in camera inspection of\nthe unredacted notes, work plans, and agendas and determined that the attempt\nby the Commissioner to shield portions of the documents from disclosure to JRC\nthrough redaction was unlawful. Thereafter, the judge immediately ordered the\nfull text of notes, work plans, and agendas produced to JRC. (Tr. X, 79; JRC-\n293-JRC-304; Tr. XIII, 30-33). The documents fully support the Trial Court's\nfindings of bad faith, as well as the findings concerning the untruthfulness of the\nCommissioner's testimony.\n38\n\nTheworkplandocumentsshowthat,contrarytotheCommissioner's\nsworntestimonym, anyofthetopicsdiscusseadtthesemeetinghsadnothingto\ndowithJRC'scertificationnorthelegitimateexerciseof DMR'sregulatory\nauthority. Oneof thefirsttopicsfor discussionattheSeptembe7r, 1993\nmeeting,wasthe Department'asttackon the Court Monitor. (JRC-293).\nSpecifically, DMR described in the work plan how it intended to substantiate its\nattack on the Court Monitor. Dr. Cerreto testified that she suggested looking at\nthe psychology Code of Ethics and filing a Complaint with the APA Ethics\nBoard, regarding Dr. Daignault. fir. X, 115-117). Although Dr. Cerreto\ndenied doing anything to follow-up her suggestion, this testimony was belied on\ncross-examination when she admitted that she did obtain 1987 examples from the\nPsychology Code of Ethics, presumably to support DMR's attack on the\nMonitor. fir. X, 127-128).\nOn September 7, 1993, Dr. Cerreto was assigned the task of determining\nwhat of JRC's property was leased and what was owned, fir. X, 125-126). Dr.\nCerreto admitted that she undertook this responsibility even though it had no\nrelationship to her role as a clinician, and was not applicable to the issue of\nwhether JRC should be certified to use Level 111procedures. (Tr. II1, 126).\nMoreover, the Commissioner testified that the issue of whether JRC's property\nwas owned or leased had no relation to the issue of certiticafion. Or. III, 223).\nThe Commissioner was then forced to concede that the testimony he had\npreviously given under oath was false, fir. IV, 152). }le did not advance any\nother legitimate regulatory justification for this activity. However, despite having\nno legitimate relationship to certification or any other regulatory justification,\nAttorney, David Ferleger was instructed to run \"title searches\" on all of JRC's\nproperty, fir. I11, 223). Again, when pressed on cross-examination, the\nCommissioner admitted that the purpose of these title searches, which utilized\nsignificant amounts of public funds, was to determine whether or not there were\n\"undisclosed related-party transactions\" with respect to JRC. O__.d_.).The\nCommissioner also admitted that he had absolutely no basis to believe that such\nundisclosed related party transactions involving JRC existed when he\ncommissioned Attorney Ferleger to undertake the title searches, fir. I11, 224).\n39\n\nIndeedt,he title searches ultimately determined that no related party transactions\nexisted. (Tr. Ill, 225). Another example of a task unrelated to certification is\nalso contained in the September 7, 1993 agenda, lllere, the Commissioner\nassigned himself the responsibility to \"confirm the financial status\" of JRC and\nto \"determine reasons for DMH rate being higher than DMR.\" (JRC-293). The\nCommissioner again conceded that this subject did not relate to certification.\nO'r. Ill, 214-215). Moreover, there was no legitimate reason for the\nCommissioner to question JRC's \"financial status\" at this time, and there was no\nreason for the Commissioner to be involved in such an inquiry, unless he was\nintent upon taking action to disrupt JRC's revenues.\nThe work plans disclosed activities which not only have no legitimate\nregulatory function, but also violated a number of DMR policies and procedures.\nFor example, when confronted with a weekly meeting work plan referencing the\nuse of a DMR investigator, the Commissioner admitted at trial that it was a\nviolation of DMR's policy of confidentiality when investigator Cohen gave the\nCommissioner specific details, conclusions, and other information obtained in a\nJRC investigation, before the investigation was completed, fir. !II, 208-209; Tr.\nIV, 32-46; U-202; U-205). 7 The Commissioner admitted that he had testified\nfalsely earlier inthe trial when he said that Investigator Cohen's only purpose in\nattending the meetings was to provide him with the status of each investigation.\nfir. IV, 36; U-202; U-208).\nIn September of 1993, a time when the Commissioner was supposedly\nat an early stage in considering JRC's application for certification, the work plan\ndocuments reveal the actual objectives of DMR to destroy JRC. At the\nSeptember 7, 1993 meeting there was discussion concerning the development of\n\"contingency plans\" for placement options for JRC students. (JRC-293).\nAdditionally, the Commissioner requested that the Attorney General's office draw\nup a plan to put JRC into receivership. General Counsel Murdock was instructed\nto include in a letter to JRC that DMR would need 60 days advance notice before\n7 The DMR investigation unit is supposed to be independent from the\nCommissioner's office. (Tr. lit, 208). In addition, the Commissioner ischarged with\ndeciding appeals from the results of the investigations. 115CMR §9.11(2).\n40\n\nJRCcloses.(JRC-293J;RC-294)I.twasmorethancoincidenctehatthe60days\nadvancenoticethatwassetforthintheagendaitemdovetailedwithCondition\n10oftheAugust 31 Letter which required JRC to give 60 days notice to its\nfunding agencies to develop emergency placement plans. 03-91). While the\nCommissioner had falsely characterized Condition 10 as being based upon an\nincident which occurred in 1991, the work plans revealed that the Tuesday\nmorning group was considering closure of JRC in 60 days, while purporting to\nact in good faith on the application for certification.\nThe Commissioner's true intentions were further revealed in the notes of\na meeting which took place on October 29, 1993. 03-220). At the bottom of\npage 1 of these notes, next to two stars and an underline, is the notation:\n\"December 15, JRC D-day.\" Appearing on page 2 of the notes is the following\nline: \"What would JRC have to do to .0_9.Ibe certified; two areas are\nand eftica_ of treatment.\" (emphasis in original). 03-220). The\nDecember 15, 1993 date which DMR characterized as \"D_lay\", was\napproximately 60 days after the Commissioner had instructed DMR to notify\nJRC's placement agencies to prepare contingency plans, and was consistent with\nthe time frame for placing JRC in receivership.\nThe work plans also revealed DMR's concern with the upcoming CBS\nnews report. While the Commissioner insisted on the witness stand that he\nplanned no action in anticipation of the forthcoming show, the wo'k plan\ndocuments revealed that this assertion was false, fir. I11, 206). The October\n15, 1993 meeting minutes reflect that DMR was planning to mail\ncommunications to JRC parents prior to the CBS news show, as well as a second\nletter after the show. 03-196). As evidenced from the work plans, the\nDepartment anticipated that the combination of its existing rdgulatory actions, the\nupcoming Rivendell report, and the CBS news piece would be sufficient to bring\nabout the demise of JRC_ Once again, the Commissioner was forced to concede\nthat the communications regarding the CBS news show had nothing to do with\nthe issue of certification, fir. II!, 250-251).\nBy late November 1993, DMR embarked on yet another strategy -- the\nattempt to interfere with JRC's fiscal affairs by attacking its rate of\n41\n\nreimbursementJ.RCreceivesa ratewhichis calculatebdy theDivisionof\nPurchaseSdervice(s\"DPS\").fir. Ill, 263).TheCommissionebrecamaeware\nof meetingsatDPSconcerninJgRC'srate,andDMRattemptetdoarrangea\n\"pre-meetingw\"ithDPSofficials.(Tr.I1!,263-271). The Commissioner could\nnot explain at trial why there was the necessity for a \"pre-meeting.\" (Tr. III,\n268-269). It was dear from the documents, however, that it was DMR's\nintention to try to convince DPS to transfer control over JRC's reimbursement\nto DMR. (Tr. III, 270). DMR had never before sought a pre-meeting with DPS\nprior to what was supposed to be a public meeting on a licensee's rate of\nreimbursement. Indeed, pre-meetings were not authorized in the regulations.\nThe Conmaissioner admitted that JRC's rate of reimbursement and DMR's efforts\nto have a pre-meeting with DPS had nothing to do with JRC's certification, yet\nthat was another topic discussed at the weekly meetings. (Tr. 111,263-271; U-\n199,2).\nThe DPS meeting with JRC occurred on December 14, 1993. (JRC-\n262). DMR took the position at that meeting that JRC's legal costs were being\nincurred against the Commonwealth and were \"non-reimbursable.\" O_d.). This\nconstituted a deliberate attempt by DMR to interfere with JRC's ability to\nprosecute this case. When confronted with this issue, the Commissioner was not\nable to answer how JRC would pay its lawyers if its legal costs were rendered\n\"non-reimbursable.\" (Tr. IV, 28). Indeed, the Commissioner's attempt to cut-\noff payments for JRC's counsel were at odds with his simultaneous efforts to\nincrease compensation for his own private counsel, Attorney Ferleger. On\nFebruary 24, 1994, the Commissioner made a written request to increase the\namount of funds that DMR was authorized to pay Attorney Ferleger from\n$73,000 to $118,000 because of increased litigation with JRC. (Tr. IV, 13-\n17,27-28; JRC-261; JRC-262,4). In his communications with both the Attorney\nGeneral's office and the Secretary of Administration and Finance in seeking the\nincrease for Attorney Ferleger, Commissioner Campbell failed to disclose that\nAttorney Ferleger, who was supl;osedly hired because of his expertise in the area\nof disabilities law and his expertise in the \"JRC\" case, was also being paid at\n42\n\npublic expense for coordinafingfitlesearcheson JRC properties, fir. IV, 8,17-\n18).\nAt the commencement of his testimony, the Commissioner repeatedly\ninsisted that the weekly meetings were held solely to address JRC's application\nfor certification. His trial counsel had within her possession documents which\ntotally contradicted this assertion. Recognizing the devastating nature of these\ndocuments, the Commissioner's counsel improperly invoked the attorney-client\nprivilege to prevent disclosure of the actual facts, fir. 111, 73). When the\ndocuments were finally produced in unredacted form -- only after repeated Court\norders (Tr. III, 67,74,75), they showed nothing less than a plan to bring about\nthe demise of the JRC program, through ak_y means possible, regardless of\n,vhether that means had any relationship to DMR's regulatory mandate.\nL. The December 15, 1993 Interim Certification Letter, And The\nFalse Allegations Concerning JRC's Failure To Report The\nDeath Of A Student\nInstead of arbitrating under the terms of the Settlement Agreement as\nrequested by JRC, the Commissioner sent to JRC another interim certification\ndecisionon December 15, 1993 (the \"December 15 Letter\") which was also sent\nto all of JRC's funding and placement agencies. (13-128; Tr. IV, 132; Tr. VIIA,\n87).\nIn the December 15 Letter, the Commissioner granted JRC only sixty\nadditional days of certification, and stated as grounds JRC's failure in the past\nto report \"deaths\" to DMR, in particular, the death of former JRC student L.C.\nwho had died in December, 1990. 03-128, 1). Commissioner Campbell\nadmitted at trial that JRC had not failed to report \"deaths\" to DMR, and he\nclaimed that \"deaths\" in the plural was a typographical error since he was only\nreferring to the death of L.C. (Tr. IV, 130-135). Nevertheless, the first page\nof the December 15 letter stated that JRC's \"failure to report a death in 199[0]\nmade it impossible for me to fulfill my responsibilities\" to investigate the death.\n(emphasis added). He went on to state that no report was made to the\nCommissioner's office. 03-128, 1).\n43\n\nThe Commissioner at trial initially was forced to admit that .1RC had\nreported the death in 1990, which was received by the Commissioner's office,\nbut attempted to justify the statement in his December 15 letter by claiming that\nJRC's report incorrectly spelled L.C.'s name and gave no other information\nabout L.C., such as identifying her placement as being at .IRC, which made it\nimpossible for DMR to investigate the death. (Tr. IV, 91-101,131). DMR's\ntrial counsel produced the \"incomplete\" death report to JRC aRer the\nCommissioner gave his testimony. (JRC-266; Tr. V, 57-59). The death report\nexplicitly indicated that on the day of L.C.'s death, JRC's report of the death was\ntimely logged in at DMR's General Counsel's oftice and included L.C.'s name,\nthe address of her JRC group home in Attleboro, the name of the Attleboro\ndetective assigned to investigate the death and his telephone number, the name\nof the hospital where L.C. died, and the cause of death reported by the\nemergency room, \"aperforated ulcer.\" 0RCo266). After being confronted with\nthe death log, the Commissioner admitted at trial that at the time he wrote his\nDecember 15 Letter, he in fact had all of the information contained in the death\nlog and that DMR could have conducted an investigation in 1990. (Tr. VI, 115-\n122). He was then compelled to admit that his previous testimony regarding the\ndeath of L.C. was false. (Tr. VI, 121-122).\nDespite having all the necessary information concerning the death, in his\nDecember 15 Letter, the Commissioner _ot only did not retract his false\nallegation, but also he disseminated it through the news media. General Counsel\nMurdock knowingly made these same false allegations to the Boston Globe and\nBoston Herald which resulted in aderogatory news article about JRC. (Tr. IV,\n44\n\n142-143). ARer these articles appeared, General Counsel Murdock attempted to\nclarify her remarks by writing to the Boston Globe and Boston Herald asserting\nmerely that she was alleging that the death was not reported to \"the\nCommissioner or his designee.\" (U-144). However, the retraction letter went\non to state that Attorney Murdock, in her original conversation with the reporter,\nhad \"added that JRC's failure to report the death to the Commissioner had\nresulted in a three-year delay in investigating it.\" ([_l.). Thus, even when she\nattempted to retract her original allegations, Attorney Murdock made another\nfalse allegation blaming JRC for the three-year delay in investigating the death\nwhen, in fact, the death had been reported to her own office within nine hours\nof the time the death occurred. (JRC-266).\nM. The Commissioner Obstructed JRC's Intake And Violated The\nJanuary 28. 1994 Court Order\nFollowing the December 15, 1993 letter, counsel for the student members\nof the class filed a motion requesting that the Commissioner send out notices to\nplacement agencies that DMR certification process not adversely affect decisions\nabout placement of students at JRC. In response, on January 28, 1994, the Trial\nCourt issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Commissioner to send a letter\nto all of JRC's funding and placement agencies informing them that the past\ncertification letters were not meant in any way to indicate that JRC's\nrecertification would not be forthcoming, and that the delay in the recertification\nprocess should in no way adversely affect any decision about a placement at JRC.\n(App., 215-217; Tr. VIIA, 87-88). However, the Commissioner's effort to close\nJRC by ruining JRC's reputation with its funding and placement agencies\ncontinued despite the Trial Court's order. JRC learned that the Commissioner\nplanned to meet with JRC's largest funding source, the New York funding and\nplacement agency (the \"New York Agency\"), on February 7, 1994. fir. IV, 60-\n64; U-208,2; Tr. VIIA, 89). At trial, the Commissioner first testified that the\nonly purpose of the meeting with the New York Agency was to discuss the status\nof JRC's certification, but then later, when confronted with his counsel's\ncorrespondence, the Commissioner admitted that the purpose of the meeting was\nto discuss the Commissioner's \"litigation\" with JRC. (Tr. IV, 60-64; U-208, 2).\n45\n\nAt a meeting with the new mediator Judge George Hurd, JRC's counsel\nrequested that a neutral party, GAL Briggs, be allowed to attend the meeting\nbetween DMR and the New York Agency. (Tr. VIIA, 89; App. 472). DMR's\ncounsel responded by saying that DMR would have noobjection to GAL Briggs's\nattendance, d0_.__)..However, the next day, General Counsel Murdock informed\nJRC by letter that DMR had no position on whether a neutral party could attend\nthe meeting, and thereafter the meeting was cancelled. (Tr. IV, 67-69;\nTr. VIIA, 90; U-138). JRC's counsel made a written request to DMR that JRC\nbe notified of any rescheduling of the meeting between DMR and the New York\nAgency whether held in person or by teleconference, fir. VIIA, 90-91;\nJRC-281). The Commissioner then rescheduled the meeting and held it by\nteleconference, but did not notify JRC or the GAL Briggs of the meeting.\n(Tr. IV, 70; App. 472). Following the meeting, a communication was sent out\nto a significant number of parents funded by the New York Agency informing\nthem that their children would be leaving JRC. (Tr. IV, 69; Tr. VIIA, 89-92).\nThe Commissioner also admitted at trial that his staff had encouraged parents to\nremove their sons and daughters from JRC. (Tr. IV, 238-240).\nAt the urging of Judge Hurd, during a meeting which took place with\nJRC and DMR representatives in January, 1994, DMR counsel agreed that the\nCommissioner would provide JRC a draft of its next certification decision and\ndiscuss the proposed conditions of certification with Dr. Israel, prior to making\nthe final decision, in an attempt to agree upon conditions that would be feasible\nfor JRC to satisfy. (Tr. VIIA, 92-93). DMR purported to comply with this\nagreement when Dr. Israel and his counsel were invited to a meeting with DMR\ncounsel on February 9, 1994 to discuss the proposed conditions of certification.\n(Tr. VIIA, 93). At the meeting, DMR counsel distributed to Dr. Israel and JRC\ncounsel what the DMR representatives called art \"outline\" of proposed conditions\nfor JRC's certification, fir. VIIA, 93). The conditions as outlined were\nimpossible for any DMR licensed program to complete. One condition required\nthat JRC within eighty days have each of its then over sixty students examined\nby a new physician and a new psychiatrist, as approved by the Commissioner,\nand then submit to DMR a written psychiatric report and a written medical\n46\n\nreport, in a form acceptable to DMR, for each student examined. Another\nequally egregious condition required JRC within the same eighty days to rewrite\nevery one of the over fifty court-approved treatment plans for the JRC students,\ni:aa form acceptable to DMR, even though the Commissioner had yet to explain\nwhy JRC's Court-approved treatment plans no longer conformed to the\nregulations, fir. VIIA, 93-99; Tr. VIIB, 15-19).\nDr. Israel explained to DMR counsel at the February 9 meeting that it\nwould be unethical and highly intrusive to the JRC students to submit them en\nmass to psychiatric and medical examinations without an indication of which, if\nany, students needed an examination. (Tr. VilA, 93-99). The JRC students\nwere already treated and followed in the normal course by physicians and\nspecialists from Boston Children's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and\nBeth Israel Hospital. l(I._.. Dr. Israel also informed DMR counsel at the\nmeeting that it would be impossible for his staff in eighty days to find qualified\nphysicians and psychiatrists to conduct and write the evaluations, and impossible\nfor the JRC psychologists to re-write over fifty treatment plans to meet a new\nundefined standard, fir. VIIA, 93-99). Dr. Israel also informed DMR counsel\nthat JRC could not afford to pay tens of thousands of dollars for new physicians\nand psychiatrists to conduct over 120 evaluations. (Tr. VIIA, 95). DMR\ncounsel refused to change any of the conditions. (Tr. VilA, 99).\nThe meeting with Dr. Israel was not a good faith attempt to resolve the\ncertification conditions. Not only did DMR refuse to address Dr. Israel's\nconcerns, but right after the meeting, on same day the Commissioner issued to\nJRC and JRC's funding and placement agencies his nineteen-page certification\nletter (the \"February 9 Letter'). The letter contained twelve conditions for\ncertification, including all of the conditions which Dr. Israel had stated were\nimpossible to meet. (U-139). Dr. Israel's concern over the impossibility of\nfulfilling the conditions in the time frame specified was later vindicated when\nresponsibilities for providing some of the services were shifted to DMR. After\nsix months had passed, DMR had still failed to comply with the requirements.\n(Tr. IV, 155, 158; Tr. VIIB, 14,22).\n47\n\nThe February 9 Letter provided that .IRC would automatically be\ndecertified if all twelve conditions were not satisfied by May 8, 1994. (U-139,\n1). The Commissioner again falsely accused JRC in the February 9 Letter of\nrepeatedly violating DMR regulations. (11-139, 1). The Commissioner also\nraised further allegations concerning the \"recording of deaths.\" (U-139). In the\nFebruary 9 Letter, which was again submitted to funding agencies, JRC was\nrequired to report all \"deaths of individuals served by the program _ to DMR\nwithin 24 hours of such death. The effect of this condition was to suggest to\nfunding agencies that deaths were not being reported to DMR, a conclusion\nwhich General Counsel Murdock repeated in the newspaper articles.\nThe Commissioner admitted at trial that he was aware when he signed\nhis February 9 Letter that the JRC students were already seen by physicians and\npsychiatrists at JRC, and admitted that he had no opinion from a physician or\npsychiatrist that students needed new evaluations. (Tr. IV, 151-154,157). The\nCommissioner also admitted at trial that his statement in the February 9 Letter\nthat the JRC treatment plans did not conform with the regulations contradicted\nthe 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports. (Tr. IV, 144-145).\nN. The Bad Faith Settlement And The July 5, 1994 Certification\nLetter\nIn May of 1994, a new team of DMR lawyers was brought in to handle\nthe JRC matter, fir. IV, 215-216). On May 9, 1994, six weeks of intensive\nnegotiations commenced between JRC and DMR over the conditions of\ncertification. The meetings occurred on almost a daily basis, fir. IV, 216; U-\n150). The results of the negotiations were eight written agreements, signed by\nthe Commissioner and Dr. Israel, which detailed DMR's and JRC's obligations\nin completing the conditions of certification, fir. VIIA, 107-109; U-150; U-\n152). On July 5, 1994, the Commissioner issued another certification letter (the\n\"July 5 Letter\") acknowledging that four of the original twelve Conditions had\nbeen satisfied by JRC and describing the eight written agreements on the other\neight conditions. (Tr. IV, 215-216; U-152, 1-3). The Commissioner stated in\nthe July5 Letter that he was extending JRC's interim certification until\nDecember 31, 1994 and would grant JRC a two-year certification at that time if\n48\n\nJRC complied with its obligations in the eight agreements on the Conditions.\n(U-152, 1-2). ARer reading an agreement with JRC, DMR promptly proceeded\nto violate material provisions of that agreement. Several examples are\nillustrative.\nThe condition that JRC re-write all of the court-approved treatment plans\nwas satisfied by having JRC psychologist Robert Worsham and DMR\npsychologist Dr. Cerreto draft a joint treatment plan which met all of DMR's\nregulatory requirements for one of JRC's most difficult clients. (Tr. VIII, 135-\n149). Dr. Cerreto signed the treatment plan, initialed each page, and the\ntreatment plan was attached to the written agreement signed by Dr. Israel and the\nCommissioner as a model plan for JRC to use in rewriting the other\napproximately fifty court-approved treatment plans at JRC. (U-152,1043;\nTr. VIII, 85,135-149). The model treatment plan contained similar treatment\nmodalities to the original court-approved plan, and also contained more\ninformation about each student and more detailed descriptions of JRC's treatment\nprocedures. Cl'r. VIII, 134-137; Tr. VIIB, 5-6). The sample treatment plan on\nwhich Dr. Cerreto signed off included authority for JRC to use the Specialized\nFood Program, the automatic negative reinforcement procedure, behavior\nrehearsal lessons and programmed multiple application with electrical skin\nstimulation, fir. VIII, 143-147; U-152,32-35).\nAnother certification condition required JRC to re-write all of its\ntreatment plans by November 21, 1994. Based on the prototype treatment plan\nnegotiated with Dr. Cerreto, Dr. Worsham and Dr. Von Heyn, JRC's only other\nfull time psychologist, spent virtually all their time between June and November\n1994 rewriting treatment plans. 0.I-152,4; Tr. VIIB, 44_; Tr. VIII, 150-151).\nDr. Worsham mailed the rewritten treatment plans to Dr. Cerreto as required.\n(JRC-290). Dr. Cerreto never responded that any of the treatment plans JRC\nprovided failed to conform to the prototype plan which had been negotiated or\nto DMR regulations. (U-166). Nevertheless, in an interim certification letter\ndated January 20, 1995, which will be discussed in further detail later, the\nCommissioner stated JRC's behavior modification treatment plans did not comply\nwith DMR regulations. (U-166). Dr. Worsham testified that his reaction to this\n49\n\nletter was one of shock since he had negotiated the prototype plan with DMR's\nchief clinician, Dr. Cerreto, who had never raised objections to the plan or to\nany of the others he had seat to her between July and November. fir. VIIi,\n152).\nThe Rivendell review satisfied the need for a independent program\nreview was satisfied according to the Commissioner by the Rivendell review.\nfir. IV220). The Commissioner, however, also reneged on this agreement and\nattempted to force JRC to submit to yet another program review by still anoth_.r\nset of outside consultants hired by DMR. (U-158; Tr. IV, 218).\nThe July 5 Letter bad set forth a schedule for treatment plan reviews of\nthe JRC students to take place. However, in defiance of the schedule, the\nCommissioner refused to proceed with those reviews, fir. VIIB, 22).\nMoreover, the letter shifted to DMR responsibility for completing new\npsychiatric and medical evaluations of each JRC student, which were to be\ncompleted by October 1, 1994. DMR, however, failed to complete those\nevaluations. (Tr. IV, 155,158; Tr. VIIB, 14,22).\nAnother of the agreements set forth a specific number of treatment plans\nthat would be intensively reviewed by DMR beginning on July 1, 1994. DMR,\nhowever, did not even start the reviews until late October 1994, and then\nattempted to increase the number of plans to be reviewed in violation of the\nagreement that it made. fir. IV, 221-223). Finally, and most importantly,\nDMR failed to extend DMR its two-year certification on December 31, 1994, as\npromised in the July 5, 1994 certification letter. (U-165).\nThe Commissioner's disavowal of his agreements was accompanied by\nthe launching of a regulatory onslaught upon JRC. In the later half of 1994, JRC\nwas besieged by hundreds of visits from an army of DMR psychologists,\npsychiatrists, physicians, investigators, licensors, service coordinators, and\nattorneys, who came to the school on a daily basis, putting massive demands on\nJRC staff and JRC attorneys. Or. VIIB, 24-27). JRC was forced to expend\nenormous resources to respond to DMR's regulatory onslaught, fir. VIIB, 25-\n27). JRC's response both to the ongoing regulatory siege, and DMR's violations\nof its agreement was to request mediation under the Settlement Agreement in a\n5O\n\nletter dated November 28, 1994 fir. VIIB 24-27; JRC-282; U-160,2). Despite\nJRC's request, DMR refused to mediate. (Exhibit 160), On December 30,\n1994, Deputy Counsel Chow.Menzer sent a letter to JRC counsel informing him\nthat interim certification for JRC would continue on a \"day-to-day basis\" until\notherwise notified by DMR. (U-165). Once again, the decision caused further\ndamage to JRC's ability to attract and maintain students since no funding or\nplacement agency would be willing to send clients to a program whose\ncertification could lapse at any moment, fir. VIIB, 39-41).\nO. The January 20, 1995 Certification Letter\nThe Commissioner's day-to-day certification of JRC continued until\nJanuary 1995, when he launched his next attack. In a certification letter dated\nJanuary 20, 1995 (the \"January 20 Letter'), the Commissioner stated that JRC\nhad not complied with several of the conditions contained in his earlier July 5,\n1994 certification letter. (U-166,1). Nevertheless, be purported to grant JRC\na one and a half year certification, but again subject to impossible conditions.\n(U-166). The Commissioner ordered JRC to stop using four aversive procedures\n(Specialized Food Program, programmed multiple applications, automatic\nnegative reinforcement and behavior rehearsals) on all students despite the fact\nthat he knew that the Trial Court had previously approved all four procedures,\nand despite Part A of the Settlement Agreement which vested treatment authority\nin the Court. 0./-166, 12-13; Tr. VI, 200-201). The Commissioner's order also\nviolated his commitment in the Report to the Court on September 22, 1993 that\nhe \"has not taken and will not take any action which.., interferes with any\ncourt-approved program. _ (App. 158). The Commissioner admitted at trial that\nhe had no medical or psychiatric support for his position that the four court-\napproved procedures he prohibited had any adverse effect on the JRC students.\nIn fact, the physicians and psychiatrists that DMR hired to conduct the medical\nand psychiatric evaluations of all the JRC clients, including those subject to the\nprocedures, found that the clients were healthy and receiving appropriate care.\nfir. VI, 95,200-202; JRC-284). The Commissioner eliminated Specialized Food\neven after his own doctors concluded that there were no adverse health effects\n51\n\nfrom the program. (13-75). Moreover, these very procedures were also the\nsubject of discussions inthe fall of 1994 between Dr. Cerreto and Dr. Worsham.\nAt no time, did Dr. Cerreto object to the use of these procedures as either not\nprofessionally supported or not in compliance with DMR regulations. (Tr. VII,\n143-144; U-152, 31-32). While banning the use of these four procedures\noutright, the Commissioner admitted at trial that he did consult with any of their\nmedical and psychiatric experts that DMR had hired regarding whether the\nwithdrawal would harm the JRC students, fir. VI, 199-200).\nAs explained in detail, ante, the Commissioner's January 20 Letter also\nfound that the 50 behavior modification treatment plans rewritten by JRC\npsychologists from June to November 1994, and received by DMR without\nobjection, did not comply with DMR regulations. (U-166,2-6,9-10). In\naddition, the January 20 Letter excluded authorization for JRC to continue Level\n111intervention for six individuals, including one who was the recent subject of\na five day treatment plan review by a lustice of the Probate Court. (U-166).\nThe Commissioner further admitted at trial that the decision to exclude this\nstudent from JRC's certification was based on the report of apsychologist whom\nthe Trial Court, in the treatment plan review held one month prior to the\nCommissioner's January 20 Letter, had found to be not credible and to have\ngiven testimony which lacked adequate factual foundation, fir. IV 228-231).\nThe Commissioner acknowledged in his testimony that his letter of January 20\nwas inconsistent with the treatment orders oftheProbateCourt inthat case. (Tr.\nIV, 231-232). Perhaps even more alarming was the Commissioner's admission\nat his pre-trial deposition and at trial, that he was not familiar with the six JRC\nstudent, whom he excluded from his January 20, 1995 grant of certification.\nfir. VI, 195-196). Indeed, the Commissioner admitted that he did not know\nwhether or not these students needed aversive procedures in order for them to\nbenefit from an effective treatment plan. fir. VI, 198).\nIn addition, the January 20 Letter first introduced the concept of\nregulatory approval of treatment plans on a \"case-by-case basis.\" There is\nnothing in the Commissioner's own regulations on certification which gives him\nthe power to apply certification in individual cases. Rather, the regulations at\n52\n\n104 CMR §20.15(4)(0 speak to the question of whether a program as a whole\nshould be certified, and leaves the decision on substituted judgment to the\ndirective of the Probate Court. CTr. ViIB, 41.-44).\nIn response to the January 20 Letter, JRC requested mediation and\narbitration under the Settlement Agreement. (U-169). Demand was again made\nthat the Commissioner adhere to the Settlement Agreement and Paragraph B-2\nwas specifically invoked. JRC's request for mediation and arbitration was\nrefused, fir. IV, 233; U-169).\nOnce again, the Commissioner sent a copy of his January 20 Letter, as\nwell as copies of a March 3, 1995 letter accusing JRC of putting its clients\n\"jeopardy\" to all of JRC's funding and placement agencies. (Tr. VIIB, 44; U-\n174; U-175). The Commissioner failed to state in those letters that all of JRC's\ntreatments had been approved and monitored by the Trial Court and that DMR's\nown physicians, psychiatrists, attorneys, and psychologists, including the 1991\nand 1993 Certification Teams found nothing wrong with the JRC procedures or\nits treatment of its students. (Tr. VIIB, 38-39; U-I_5; U-174; U-175).\nP. The QUEST Survey Results And The Commissioner's March 23,\n1995 De-Certification Of JRC\nAn additional aspect of DMR's regulation over JRC is the licensure of\nthe residences JRC provides for its students, fir. VIIIB, 30). On November 15,\n1994, DMR conducted a licensing survey known as the QUEST survey of JRC's\ngroup homes. On March 15, 1995, JRC received results of DMR's so-called\nQUEST survey. The QUEST report was completed on December 20, 1994, but\nDMR did not disclose it to JRC until three months later. (Id.). The report\nfaulted JRC in all seven sections of the survey for such illogical reasons as JRC\nstaff engaging intoo much affectionate and caring interaction with students; JRC\nnot providing its severely mentally retarded and autistic clients with their own\nkeys to their group homes; JRC using \"stigmatizing\" school buses instead of\ntransporting its students in individual passenger vehicles; and, perhaps the height\nof absurdity, JRC not having one of its students on its Board of Directors. (U-\n164,1,5,7,25,43,45). DMR gave JRC 90 days to cure the deficiencies cited in\nthe QUES'I report or JRC's group homes would be de-licensed. 0.1-183). Once\n53\n\nagain, JRC wrote to DMR requesting that DMR arbitrate the results of the\nlicensing survey. (Tr. VilB, 30-32,38-40; U-283). DMR never responded to\nthis request.\nOn March 23, 1995, the Commissioner decertified JRC and ordered all\ncourt-approved aversive treatment stopped. 03-179). On March 24, 1995, the\nTrial Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Commissioner from\nenforcing his decertification order and interfering with court-approved treatment\nplans. (App. 283). The preliminary injunction was designed to preserve the\nstatus gu_Qpending the trial on the merits.\nQ. Damage Caused By The Commissioner's Contemntuous Conduct\nThe JRC students, parents and JRC itself were all caused egregious harm\nby the Commissioner's course of conduct. The severity of the JRC students'\nbehavior disorders, and their dependence on JRC's unique program to maintain\ntheir health, safety and quality of life, rendered the JRC students extremely\nvulnerable to harm from any diminution in the quality of the JRC program.\nfir. VIIA, 51; Tr. VilB, 15-18; Tr. II, 189). The quality of the JRC program\ndid greatly diminish from August 6, 1993 to the time of trial because of the\nCommissioner's campaign to destroy the school, fir. VIIB, 25-27).\nThe Commissioner attacked JRC in two ways. First, the Commissioner\npublished to the world at large, and to JRC's funding and placement agencies in\nparticular, a stream of false statements about JRC and its Executive Director in\nan effort to dissuade those agencies from sending new students to JRC, and to\npersuade them to remove students already placed at JRC. This attack struck at\nJRC's ability to maintain its students and attract new ones which are the sole\nsource of its revenue. 03-82; U-91; U-106; U-128; U-139; U-166; U-175; U-\n176; U-179). In August of 1993, seventy-five percent of JRC's students were\nplaced and funded by states other than Massachusetts and most of the students\nwere placed and funded by New York. fir. VllA, 43). In his certification\nletters, the Commissioner falsely depicted JRC as an unsafe, unlawful, renegade\nprogram that could not be trusted with the care of disabled people and certainly\nnot the care of the most vulnerable people in the nation, rid.). The\n54\n\nCommissioner told JRC's funding and placement agencies that JRC was\nrepeatedly violating regulations, providing professionally unacceptable and\nineffective treatment, not reporting deaths, and abusing students. (U-82; U-91;\nU-106; U-128).\nFrom 1987 until August 6, 1993, JRC had built a national reputation for\nsuccessfully treating individuals with some of the most severe behavior disorders\nin the country. (Tr. VIIA, 50-53). JRC's enrollment steadily increased from\nforty-three in 1987 to sixty-six in August of 1993 and states were paying\n$161,000 per student in tuition, fir. VIII, 133,167-168). In less than two\nyears, the Commissioner destroyed six years of growth by reducing JRC's\nenrollment from sixty-six to forty-three students by the time of trial, fir. VIIB,\n55-58; VIll, 168-170). The Commissioner caused a thirty percent drop in JRC's\nrevenues, but he did not stop there in his efforts to destroy JRC. (Tr. VIIB, 55-\n59; VIII, 170-172).\nAs the second prong of his attack, the Commissioner taxed JRC's\nremaining resources by bombarding JRC with a stream of regulatory demands\nstarting with the August 6, 1993 Letter, and continuing until the time of trial\nwith over four hundred visits to JRC from DMR personnel during that period of\ntime. fir. VIIB, 25-27). The Commissioner ensured that JRC exhausted its\nresources to comply with his regulatory demands by keeping an ever-present\nthreat of sudden decertification hanging over JRC. (Tr. 111, 162-168, 170-171).\nOn almost a monthly basis, from August 6, 1993 to the time of trial, JRC had\nto use its staff and its lawyers to respond to the Commissioner's litany of\nregulatory demands and unfounded accusations, fir. VIIA, 34-39,75-78;\nTr. VIIB 8-19; JRC-287; JRC-288).\nFor almost two years the Commissioner preoccupied JRC lawyers, JRC's\nExecutive Director and JRC's top administrators and psychologists with\nresponding to all of the regulatory demands, fir. VIIA, 34-39,75-78,104-105;\nTr. VIIB, 6-19,25-26; JRC-284; JRC-285; JRC-287; JRC-288). The enormity\nof the demands placed on JRC by the Commissioner, and the resources expended\nby JRC to respond, isborne out by over four hundred trial exhibits, which isjust\na sample of the regulatory nightmare created by the Commissioner in his effort\n55\n\nto bury JRC with regulatory demands. The Commissioner admitted at trial that\nhe knew that his certification decisions would affect the JRC students and the\noperation of the JRC program, fir. VI, 86-87).\nJRC was forced to respond to DMR's unprecedented regulatory demands\nat a time when its revenues were rapidly dropping and its legal fees skyrocketing.\n(rr. VIIB, 55,58-59; Tr. VIII, 170-174). JRC would not have survived had it\nnot retained counsel to defend itself against the Commissioner's regulatory\nonslaught and prosecute this contempt action. (Tr. VIIB, 49-50,51). In order\nto survive financially and pay its counsel, JRC had no choice but to conduct\nmassive layoffs and reduce expenditures for the JRC students, fir. !!, 185,\nTr. VIIB, 51-52,54; Tr. VIII, 171-174). Even with the lower staffing costs,\nJRC's projected revenues in 1996 were $3,000,000 less than 1995. (Tr. VII,\n171-172). Moreover, JRC's balance sheet surplus has been negatively impacted\nwhich affects its ability to access a line of credit. JRC's credit line is essential\nfor the school to maintain its staff and serve its students. Without the line of\ncredit, JRC would be unable to meet ongoing payroll needs. (Tr. VIi, 195-196).\nThe legal fees alone required to repel DMR's onslaught exceeded $800,000.\n(App. 1341).\nAlthough JRC isbest-known for its aversive program, the most effective\nand important part of the JRC program is the elaborate program of rewards and\npositive programming for the JRC students and JRC's state of the art education\nprogram. (Tr. VIIB, 66-67; Tr. It, 184-185). The Commissioner caused harm\nto the JRC students when his regulatory demands diverted JRC's resources from\nthe students and the program, fir. VilB, 4-7,13-17,25-27,53-54,59-69;\nTr. VIIA, 104-107; Tr. I1, 184-189; Tr. IV, 92). As a result of stafflayoffs, the\nstudents had to be taught in large groups which prohibited the teaching of new\nskills because of the need for one-to-one teacher/student attention for JRC's\ndisabled population. (Tr. VIlB, 61-62,67-69). The students lost the most\neffective rewards which had been used to keep the students from engaging in\ntheir life-threatening behaviors, fir. II, 184; Tr. VllB, 61-69; Tr. IX, 92). JRC\nsimply did not have the funds to finance thz field trips and other expensive and\nstaff intensive rewards. 0___.). JRC's psychology staff could not focus on the\n56\n\nstudentsa,ndmonitorandintprove the students' programs, because they were\nneeded to respond to the Commissioner's false accusations and redundant\nreg_datory demands, fir. VIIA, 105,107; VIIB, 4-7,13-17,58,59). At least two\nJRC students suffered a substantial increase in their health-dangerous behaviors\nas a direct and immediate result of the Commissioner's illegal and precipitous\nprohibitionofJRC's Specialized Food Program. fir. VIIB, 63-65, Tr. IX, 96).\nThe Commissioner needlessly caused a substantial deterioration in the quality of\nlife of the JRC students when he deprived them of the rewards, education,\ncompanionship and affection of the JRC staff. (Tr. VllB, 4-7,13-17,53-54,59-\n69; Tr. VIIA, 104-107; Tr. 11, 184-189; Tr. IX, 92). Because of their\nextraordinary disabilities, the JRC students were helpless to replace the human\ncontact and opportunity for advancement that DMR stole from them through its\nbad faith and contemptuous conduct.\n57\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nThe Trial Court's construction of the Settlement Agreement and\nenforcement through the contempt sanction against the Commissioner of Mental\nRetardation were correct as a matter of law, as civil contempt properly lie,s\nagainst the Commonwealth and its branches. The terms of the Settlement\nAgreement impose unequivocal legal obligations on DMR and the Conunissioner\nas parties. Furthermore, the standard for finding contempt of the Settlement\nAgreement as a public law consent decree is more flexible, and enforcement\nthrough contempt isproper since the Commissioner violated the objectives of the\nSettlement Agreement. Since the Settlement Agreement is a public law consent\ndecree rooted in ongoing public reform litigation between JRC and state\nregulatory agencies, this Court should accord great deference to the Trial Court's\nconstruction and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement. (pp. 62-65).\nThe Settlement Agreement created a framework whereby the health and\nsafety of the JRC's students would be adequately monitored, but no longer\nexclusively enttuzted to state officials who had acted in an arbitrary manner in\ntheir prior regulation of JRC. The exclusive role of the state administrative\nagencies in regulating JRC was changed substantively in all respects from the\nmethod by which JRC was earlier regulated. DMR became a full party subject\nto the substantive provisions of the Settlement Agreement in 1988, and the\nCommissioner and his predecessor in the role of regulator of JRC adhered to its\nprovisions and objectives until 1993. DMR exhibited its full party status under\nthe Settlement Agreement through its conduct and representations to third parties.\nUntil August of 1993, the Commissioner deferred to the Trial Court on all\ntreatment decisions, even after the adoption of the behavior modification\nregulations which vested him with authority to certify Level 111 aversive\ntreatments. (pp. 66-74).\nThe Trial Court correctly concluded that the Commissioner violated the\nexpress terms and overall objectives of numerous provisions of the Settlement\nAgreement. The Commissioner engaged in contempt of Part A of the Settlement\nAgreement by unilaterally ordering aversive treatment terminated, even those\ntreatments approved by the Probate Court, the exact regulatory power modified\n58\n\nwiththesigningoftheSettlemenAtgreement. The Commissioner engaged in\ncontempt of Paragraph B-2 by unilaterally enforcing his regulatory authority over\n/RC in spite of the Court Monitor, and in refusing to arbitrate regulatory\ndisputes. The Commissioner engaged in contempt of Part C of the Settlement\nAgreement by sending to JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies bogus\ncertification letters containing false allegations of wrongdoing and abuse by\nJRC's staff thereby interfering with the intake of new clients and the subsidizing\nof existing clients, The Commissioner violated the good faith provisions in Part\nL of the Settlement Agreement by violating the substantive provisions of the\nSettlement Agreement, engaging in corrupt tactics in response to the JRC\nprogram, and otherwise failing to substantially comply with the provisions and\nobjectives of the Settlement Agreement from 1993 until trial, which conduct was\nconsistent with a strategy to destroy JRC and eliminate its treatment. The\nevidence adduced by JRC showing that the Commissioner perpetrated a fraud on\nthe Trial Court by submitting a false Report to the Court in 1993 which\nnegatively depicted JRC's program was sufficient evidence of bad faith on the\npart of the Commissioner, which then shifted the burden onto DMR to produce\nevidence to refute JRC's evidence of latent misconduct and bad faith. (pp. 74-\n86).\nThe Trial Court did not abuse its discretion in making the limited\nevidentiary rulings at trial contested by the Commissioner. The Court did not\nerroneously refuse DMR's request to extend discovery to complete a Rule\n30['o)(6) deposition of JRC, after DMR's original notice of deposition did not\nsatisfy the rule. In any event, DMR had ample opportunity to examine JRC's\nexpert witness on the issue of financial harm. DMR also had ample opportunity\nto rebut the evidence of harm to the students caused by the Commissioner's\ncontempt without the need for additional medical examinations of two students.\nLikewise, DMR had ample opportunity tooffer its own evidence regarding JRC's\nclaim of DMR's disparate treatment of the JRC program through the testimony\nof a DMR investigator. The judge's instruction to counsel to move on to\nrelevant testimony was a proper exercise of the discretion over the trial process.\nQ\n59\n\nEven if there were error, the Commissioner can show no prejudice to his\nsubstantial rights requiring reversal. (pp. 86-92).\nThe Findings of Fact by the Trial Court are not clearly erroneous. A\ncomparison of the Trial Court's Findings of Fact and JRC's proposed findings,\nsubmitted atthe close of trial and prior to the entry of judgment, reveals that the\nfindings reflect the judge's independent judgment. Even if the Trial Court had\nadopted JRC's proposed findings verbatim, the Commissioner cannot show that\nthe factual findings of the Trial Court are clearly erroneous. The Trial Judge's\nfindings are presumed to be correct, and will not be reversed where supported\nby the record evidence, including any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\nThis includes the factual findings drawn from the documentary evidence. The\nCommissioner violates well-established appellate standards by misstating the\nfindings of the Trial Court and distorting the record to support a claim that the\nfindings are clearly erroneous. Despite distorting the record, the Commissioner\ncannot escape that he was forced to concede to numerous inconsistencies and\nmisrepresentations throughout his trial testimony. Moreover, the record evidence\nand reasonable inferences drawn therefrom supports all of the findings which the\nCommissioner attacks, and those he does not. (pp. 92-147).\nLikewise, the Trial Court did not abuse its broad discretion in granting\nas a remedy for contempt equitable relief in the form of a permanent injunction\nand receivership over DMR in regards to its regulation of JRC. The Trial Court\nwas warranted in affirmatively ordering the Commissioner and DMR to comply\nwith the terms of the Settlement Agreement based upon the conclusion, as\nsupported by the record, that future unlawful conduct by the Commissioner and\nDMR against JRC was likely to occur. Similarly, the Trial Court was warranted\nin issuing abroad order completely supplanting the executive regulatory functions\nof DMR as they related to JRC by appointing a receiver to ensure compliance\nwith the Commissioner's legal obligations under the Settlement Agreement. The\nbroad authority of the receiver is warranted to address the significant damage\ninflicted upon JRC and its students by the contemptuous conduct of the\nCommissioner, and to prevent further injury. Because both the contempt finding\nand the relief granted were well within the broad discretion of the Trial Court,\n60\n\nthisCourtforthe fifth time should deny a stay of pending appeal, There is no\nlikelihood that the Commissioner will succeed on the merits of this appeal, and\nitis likely that the Commissioner will continue to cause harm to the JRC students\nif he is allowed to continue with his regulation of JRC. (pp. 147-160).\nThe amount of attorneys' fees awarded to JRC counsel for defending\nagainst the Commissioner's contemptuous conduct since 1993 was reasonable in\nlight of the regulatory and legal bombardment, and was not abuse of discretion.\nCounsel for JRC provided the Trial Court with ample evidence in the form of\nextensive affidavits and the actual client bills to define the objective worth of the\nservices provided by counsel on behalf of JRC. The award of attorneys' fees\nshould not be reversed merely because JRC counsel refused to provide to the\nCommissioner unredacted versions of actual client bills and contemporaneous\ntime sheets. The Trial Court properly reviewed in camera and, thereafter,\nimpounded the actual bills submitted by JRC to protect the attorney-client\nprivileged material contained therein. The Commissioner has shown no\ncompelling need to obtain the bills which overrides the attorney-client privilege.\n(pp. 161-170).\nThis Court should award JRC double costs and attorneys' fees for having\nto respond to the frivolous appeal from the underlying judgment of contempt.\nThere is no basis in law or fact for reversing the judgment. The Commissioner\nalso consistently distorts the findings of the Trial Court in his Brief, thereby\nnecessitating that this Court carefully scrutinize each one of the record citations\nin the Commissioner's Brief. Furthermore, the Commissioner miseites and\nmisapplies the applicable case law. This case represents egregious appellate\nmisconduct which should not go unpunished by this Court. (pp. 171-173).\nThe Commissioner's appeal from the Trial Court's status _ preliminary\ninjunction is rendered moot by the entry of final judgment. Likewise, this Court\nshould vacate the interlocutory orders of the Trial Court as modified by a Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court. The modified status Ru..Qpreliminary injunction is\nextinguished by the entry of final judgment. (pp. 174-176).\n61\n\nARGUMENT\nI. TilE TRIAL COURT CORRECTLY DETERMINED THAT TIlE\nCOMMISSIONER WAS IN CONTEMPT OF TIlE SETI'LEMENT\nAGREEMENT\nThe Commissioner argues that the finding of contempt was erroneous as\na matter of law; the conclusion of contempt was not supported by the evidence;\nand the good faith provision of the Settlement Agreement was not violated.\n(Brief, pp.37-61). There was no abuse of discretion by the Trial Court in this\ncase.\nThe Trial Court's Construction And Enforcement of the\nA,\nSettlement Agreement Through The Contempt Sanction Were\nCorrect As A Matter of Law\nIt is well-settled that a finding of civil contempt for violation of a court\norder properly lies against the Commonwealth and does not implicate the\nseparation of powers of the governmental branches. See Commonwealth v. One\n1987 Ford Ec0ngline Van, 413 Mass. 407, 411 (1992); see also Nelson v_.\nSteiner, 279 F.2d 944, 948 (7th Cir. 1980); United States v. Board of Education\nof City of Chiea_o, 744 F.2d 1300, 1306-1308 (7th Cir. 1984). The decision\nto enforce a court order through the sanction of civil contempt is within the\ndiscretion of the Trial Court. See AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1101\n(lst Cir. 1983).\nThe Commissioner argues, however, that the Trial Court erred as a\nmatter of law in not stating his exact conduct which constituted a violation of the\nSettlement Agreement. (Brief, pp.38-39). This argument isgroundless since the\nTrial Court's voluminous factual findings establish, as will be discusse,J indetail,\nclear violations of a number of different parts of the Settlement Agreement. In\nits Findings of Fact, the Trial Court initially recites the relevant sections of the\nSettlement Agreement, and then proceeds to recount in explicit factual detail the\nactions of the Commissioner over nearly two years which violated the cited\nsections. (App. 1212). The Trial Court in its Conclusions of Law expressly and\n62\n\nrightfullyrefusedtoreiterateallof the factual bases constituting a violation of\nthe Settlement Agreement. (App. 1302). 8\nThe Commissioner's argument that the mandates of the Settlement\nAgreement are too ambiguous to force any legal obligation upon him or DMR\nas a matter of law is also meritless. The terms of the Settlement Agreement\nimpose clear and unequivocal legal obligations on DMR and the Commissioner\nregarding the regulation of JRC. See Commonwealth v, One 1987 Ford\nE¢onoline Van, 413 Mass. at 411. 9 Furthermore, the standard for finding\ncontempt of the Settlement Agreement as a public law consent decree is more\nflexible, in contrast to the cases relied on by the Commissioner. The test for\ndetermining contempt of public law consent decrees is \"substantial compliance\"\nwith the overall objectives of the decree, see United States v. Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, 890 F.2d 507, 509 (lst Cir. 1989), not rigid compliance with its\nexpress terms. \"A finding of civil contempt must be based not on a mere\nviolation of a court order but on a party's failure to achieve substantial and\ndiligent compliance in mear_ingful respects with what the court has ordered.\"\nPalmi_iano v. DiPrete, 700 F. Supp. 1180, 1191 (D. R.I. 1988). In such cases,\nalthough in the strictest sense the complainant must prove a violation of the\n\"order,\" the central inquiry is whether there has been a violation of the spirit of\nthe underlying consent decree in reference to both the terms of the order and the\nobjectives sought by the parties in agreeing to become bound by such a decree.\n\"Consent decrees have a dual nature: they blend a court order with the parties'\nagreement.\" Juan F. By and Throu_,h Lynch v. Weicker, 37 F.3d 874, 878 (Ist\nCir. 1994). In other words, the touchstone of contempt of a public law consent\ndecree is a violation of the intent, spirit and objectives of the decree, not a\n: Because the Commissioner presented this same spurious argumentin hisMotion\nfor Stay at the Trial Court level, the judge, inthe order denying a stay, again articulated\nthe Commissioner's various violations of the Settlement Agreement, referencing specific\nparagraphs of the Settlement Agreement toactions of the Commissioner described in the\nfactual findings. (App. t434-35).\n9 This Court stated InThe Matter Of McKnight, 406 Mass. at 791, that an action\nfor contempt by JRC would properly lieagainst DMR for a violation of the Settlement\nAgreement.\n63\n\nviolation of the strict terms of the order. See United States v. Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, 890 F.2d at 510-1 I; Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951\nF.2d 1325, 1337 (lst Cir. 1991); L_ngton v. Joh_li|9ll, 928 F.2d 1206, 1221 (Ist\nCir. 1991) (contempt upheld despite record indicating not 'letter-perfect\ncomplian :e\" with consent decree).\nCourts construe the overall objectives of public law consent decrees for\ncontempt purposes by engaging in \"a more flexible interpretation in light of the\nneed to achieve their basic purposes and the need to accommodate the differing\ncompetencies of different branches of government as well as the differing needs\nand interests of the parties.\" Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizen8 v,\nK_jD.g,688 F.2d 602, 608-09 (lst Cir. 1981); _ Juan F. By and Throcgh\nLynch v. Weicker. 37 F.3d at 878. For this reason, appellate courts have less\nfreedom when reviewing a trial court's enforcement of a public law decree than\nwhen reviewing a private consent decree:\nIn the context of public law litigation, however, the guidelines\nare much different. In such cases, the district court's\nconstruction of a consent decree should be accorded considerable\ndeference, because broad leeway is often necessary to secure\ncomplicated, sometimes conflicting policy objectives.\nLank,ton v. Johnston, 928 F. 2d at 1221; _ AMF. Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d\nat 1101 (programmatic public law decrees require flexible approach).\nThe reason behind this \"double standard,\" as articulated by the court in\n_,sup._, isthat n[i]nacommercialsetting, a consent decree istreated like\na contract because the court assumes that the private parties understand the\neconomic realities and business consequences of their agreements;\" while \"[i]n\npublic law litigation, courts typically play a proactive role -- a role which can\nhave nearly endless permutations.\" 928 F.2d at 1221. The added deference\nwhich an appellate court accords a trial court's construction and enforcement of\na public law consent decree is borne from the court's role in public law\nlitigation:\nFrequently, the trial court's adjudicative function blends with its\nservice as an instrument for change. The relief requested often\ninvolves the restructuring of a state or city program, requiring\n64\n\nthe court to fashionequitable remMies -- sometimes unique and\noften complicated -- in order to secure \"complex legal goals.\"\n(citations omitted). Citing an authoritative source on a court's role in\npublic reform litigation, the Lan_ton court noted that consent decrees in the\npublic law context provide for a \"complex on-going regime of performance\nrather than a simple, one-shot, one-way transfer,\" which \"prolongs and deepens,\nrather than terminates, the court's involvement with the dispute.\" Ibid., .q_\nChayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law LiUgaUon, 89 Harv,L.Rev. 1281,\n1298 (1976). Therefore, as the court explained, the construction and manner of\nenforcement of public law consent decrees requires a \"wider view of the\nlitigation\" and the rejection of \"tunnel vision.\" 928 F.2d at 1221.\nThus, the First Circuit has held that when examining a finding of\ncontempt of a public law consent decree, an appellate court must defer to the\ndistrict court's \"broad discretion in determining whether the objectives of the\ndecree have been substantially achieved.\" United States v. Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, 890 F.2d at 509; _ Massachusetts Association of Older\nAmericans v. Commissioner of Public Welfare, 803 F.2d 35, 38 (Ist Cir. 1986).\nAn appellate court also gives greater deference to the trial court's enforcement\nof a public law consent decree through the imposition of a contempt sanction\nwhere the interest at stake is great, and the consequences of the failure to comply\nwith the consent decree are serious. See Fortin v. Commissioner of\nMassachusetts Dept. of Public Welfare, 692 F.2d 790, 795 (lst Cir. 1982); see\nalso Massachusetts Association of Older Americans v. Commissioner of Public\nWelfare, 803 F.2d at 39, 41. The result is that an appellate court, already\nlimited to reviewing the trial court's determination of contempt of a consent\ndecree under an abuse of discretion standard, is further restricted to reviewing\nthe trial court's construction and enforcement of a public law consent decree with\n\"deference to the district court's intimate understanding of the history and\ncircumstances\" of the litigation. United States v. Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, 890 F.2d at 509-10.\n65\n\nB. This Court Should Afford Great Deference to the Trial Court's\nConstruction And Enforcement of the Settlement A_,reement\nThe Commissioner asks this Court to review de novo the evidence inthe\nlight most favorable to the Commissioner and then apply those facts to his\ninterpretation of the Settlement Agreement. This Court should decline the\nCommissioner's invitation to use \"tunnel vision\" to interpret a complex\ndocument, by extricating portions of the Settlement Agreement and reviewing the\nevidence in a vacuum, without any deference to the Trial Court's construction\nof the overall objectives of the Settlement Agreement and its practical\nimplementation by all parties for nearly seven years until the Commissioner\nabruptly altered his position in 1993.\nA deferential standard of review is particularly applicable to the instant\ncase in light of the history of the 1987 Settlement Agreement as a progranunatic\nconsent decree rooted in public law litigation. The Settlement Agreement\nemanated from time-consuming litigation in 1985 and 1986 between a residential\ntreatment program for handicapped children, the parents of those children, and\nthe state agency. In addition to its legal complexity, the earlier litigation\ninvolved emotionally charged issues addressing such fundamental concerns as the\nright of parents to decide on the best treatment program for their handicapped\nchildren and the right of licensed programs to fair and impartial regulation by the\ngovernment. (App. 81).\nThe Settlement Agreement put an end to the litigation and established a\nframework defining the respective roles of the parties in balancing the complex\ntreatment needs of the JRC clients with the state's regulatory authority. (S.A.\n20). The foundation of this structure was that the state should not be permitted\nto implement unilaterally its regulatory powers in a way aimed at terminating the\nJRC program. In 1985, the Director of the OFC ordered JRC to terminate the\nuse of aversive therapies in treating its students, asserting that its powers as\nregulatory agency gave it the ultimate authority to determine which treatments\ncould be used at JRC. (App. 82-83; S.A. 82). In June of 1986, the Court found\nthat the Director of OFC had acted in bad faith in attempting to terminate the\ntreatment program of JRC and was preliminarily enjoined from taking further\n66\n\nregulatorayctionagainsJtRC. (App.107).In issuing the injunction, the Court\nexpressly found that the Director's unilateral and arbitrary regulatory decisions\ninterfered wRh the treatment received by the severely handicapped students,\nwhich conduct directly threatened their lives. 1° (App. 107). The aim of\nsettlement negotiations was to achieve a dual goal whereby the health and safety\nof JRC students would be adequately monitored but not exclusively entrusted to\nstate ofticials who had acted in an arbitrary manner in their prior regulation of\nJRC. (S.A. 20-21).\nThis dual objective was achieved with the signing of the Settlement\nAgreement in 1986 and Court approval in 1987. There can be no meanin,?ful\ndebate that the exclusive role of the state administrative agencies in regulating\nJRC was changed substantively in all respects from the method by which JRC\nwas earlier regulated. The Commonwealth agreed to relinquish its regulatory\nauthority over JRC by agreeing that the Court Monitor would be responsible for\noverseeing JRC's compliance with state regulations, except for the regulations\npertaining to aversive therapies. All regulation of aversive therapies was\nexpressly reserved for the Trial Court which would determine the propriety of\nany and all such therapies and apply the substituted judgment criteria on an\nindividual student basis. (App. 121). The Commonwealth would have the\nopportunity to participate in the litigation of aversive therapies in the substituted\njudgment hearings. The Commonwealth could also raise any concerns over\ntreatment provided by seeking alternative dispute resolution through arbitration\nwith the Court Monitor according to Paragraph B-2. If either party was not\nsatisfied with the decision or recommendations of the Court Monitor, it could\nappeal to the Trial Court for a final ruling. (App. 126). This dispute resolution\nsystem agreed to by the parties was intended to replace the normal route of\nlengthy and costly administrative remedies, and inevitable judicial review through\nI0 The._ findings were upheldby a Single Justice of the Appeals Court indenying\nOFC's petition for interlocutory relief. (App. 109).\n67\n\nlitigation.\" Inorder to end the prior litigation, the Commonwealth agreed to\nrelinquish its prior right to unilateral regulatory power over JRC. Since the\nexecution of the Settlement Agreement, numerous additional Court orders have\nbeen issued. In addition, the Trial Court and officials have devoted countless\nhours to implementing the Settlement Agreement which has \"prolong[edl and\ndeepened[edl . . . the Court's involvement with the dispute.\" See Lan_on v.\nJohnston, 928 F.2d at 1221.\nThe Commissioner mischaracterizes JRC's argument by falsely\ncontending that JRC is somehow asserting and that the Settlement Agreement\nmandates that the Commissioner should have refrained from regulating JRC's\ntreatment program. JRC has never asserted such a position, as the Commissioner\nwell knows. Despite the findings of bad faith and arbitrary conduct by state\nofficials in 1985 and 1986, the Settlement Agreement did not strip the\nCommonwealth from regulating JRC. Rather, the Settlement Agreement plainly\nanticipated that DMR would have the ability to license JRC homes, any\nregulation of JRC by DMR would occur within a new court-supervised\nframework, and that any differences of opinion would be resolved pursuant to a\nmore streamlined dispute resolution process which was specifically designed to\navoid the type of expensive, drawn-out litigation which had so dramatically\naffected the health and well being of JRC students from September of 1985 to\nDecember of 1986.\nC. The Commissioner and DMR Followed The Settlement\nAgreement Until August of 1993\nIn his Brief, the Commissioner essentially provides a revisionist history\nof his and DMR's regulatory actions involving JRC. This history is factually\n_ The exhaustion of administrative remedies argumentisjust ared herring. The\nconcept of exhaustion flies in the face of the spirit and intent of the Settlement\nAgreement, which expressly states that it was intended to eliminate the \"multitude of\nlawsuits and administrative proceedings.\" (App. 120). The Commissioner knows that\nthe exhaustion argument has nomerit, and forhis reason herelegates an argument, which\ncould be dispositive in other contexts, to a footnote, not even rising to the level of\nappellate argument. See Rate Settin_ Commission v. Faulkner Hoso., 411 Mass. 701,\n707 (1992); Hutchinson v. Hutchinson, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 705,711 (1978).\n68\n\ninaccurataend fails to mention those acts which demonstrate that DMR and the\nCommissioner interpreted the Settlement Agreement in the same way as did the\nother parties and Trial Court until the summer of 1993, when the Commissioner\nembarked on his plan to disrupt Court-approved treatment and close JRC.\nThe Commissioner now asserts that the provisions of the Settlement\nAgreement were much too vague and ambiguous for him to understand his\nobligations. This argument belies the actions and public statements of the\nCommissioner and DMR officials when they practiced strict compliance with all\nof the terms of the Settlement Agreement until August, 1993. The\nCommissioner's own testimony at trial demonstrated that regulatory action was\ntaken against JRC because the Commissioner purportedly formed the sudden\nbelief in the summer of 1993 that he was no longer a party to the Settlement\nAgreement, (Tr.lll, 16-18), not because the provisions were unclear or\nambiguous. This sudden position was in total contrast with prior internal agency\nand public positions previously taken by the Commissioner and DMR. The Trial\nCourt was fully justified in finding that the Commissioner's position was\ncompletely arbitrary and a pretext designed to hide his true motive of utilizing\nhis public power to improperly achieve his predetermined goal of closing JRC. t2\n1. DMR and the Commissioner are full partie_ to the\nSettlement Aereement\nThe Commissioner's argues throughout his Brief that the substantive\nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement do not apply to the Commissioner and\nignoring the history of the Settlement Agreement and the conduct of DMR in\nholding itself out as a full party to the Settlement Agreement from 1988 through\n1993. Likewise, assuming, ar_uendo, that the terms of the Settlement Agreement\nwere somehow vague or ambiguous, the conduct of the Commissioner and his\npredecessor in the role of regulator of JRC shows that he and his advisors\n,2 Perhaps the best evidence of the irrationalmotive of the Commissioner's \"non-\nparty\" argument isthe fact that the Commissioner has now abandoned this argument on\nappeal. However, he cannot abandon his prior sworn testimony; that his actions with\nrespect to JRC, the Trial Court, and court officials were guided by his supposed belief\nthat he was not a party to the Settlement Agreement. (Tr.lll, 16-18).\n69\n\nunderstootdhatDMR was a party to the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement\nAgreement provided a buffer between JRC and the Commonwealth through the\nCourt Monitor, the Settlement Agreement placed conditions on his regulatory\nauthority over ._C, and the Settlement Agreement granted to the Trial Court\nexclusive power to determine treatment for the JRC students.\nThe Settlement Agreement was amended by order of the Trial Court to\nadd DMR as a party on December 29, 1988, in response to a motion to amend\nfiled by DMR after DMR took over regulatory responsibility of JRC from DMH\nwhen DMR became a separate agency. (1.1-13). The Trial Court's order\nallowing DMR to intervene, thereby making DMR a full party to the Settlement\nAgreement was not appealed? 3 Thereafter, the Commissioner and other DMR\nofficials represented to third parties, including this Court, that DMR was the state\nagency which had full party status under the Settlement Agreement. In its brief\nto this Court in the case In The Matter Of McKnight, 406 Mass. 787 (1990), the\nAssistant Attorney General explained the procedural history of the case stating,\n\"That action was resolved by Settlement Agreement entered as an order of the\nProbate Court on January 7, 1987. DMR is a party to that Settlement\nAgreement, having been joined by order of the Probate Court dated December\n29, 1988 in response to DMR's motion, which was grounded on DMR's role in\nlicensing and regulating providers of treatment for autism.\" (See, Appellent's\nBrief, p. 6; JRC-253,5)? _\n_3 Even if DMR had not expressly moved to intervene as a party, itwould have\nbeen bound to the provisions of the Settlement Agreement as the successor agency to\nDMH. See Cornelius v. Hogan, 663 F.2d 330, 332-35 (lst Cir. 1981) (holding consent\ndecree to apply to social services formerly provided by DPW but transferred to the\nresponsibility of DSS, and fact DSS not an original party to decree did not preclude its\nbeing bound by the decree).\n_4 Likewise, ina letter dated March 27, 1992tothe Executive Department'sOffice\nof Quality Assurance, General Counsel Murdock, on the Commissioner's behalf, stated,\n\"Due topast litigation, the Department iscurrently bound by Settlement Agreement with\nrespect to thisprogram [JRC]. All socalled aversive interventions used at B.R.I. must\nbe approved by the Bristol County Probate Court; tho Department's involvement in the\nactual treatment is limited.\" (1J-41). (Emphasis supplied).\n70\n\n2. DMR and the Commissioner conducted themselves as\nfull parties to the Settlement A_,reement\nFrom 1988 to August 1993, DMR consistently through its conduct held\nitself out as a party to the terms and objectives of the Settlement Agreement.\nThe Trial Court was not bound by the four corners of the Settlement Agreement\nin determining its mandates. See United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co.,\n420 U.S. 223,228 (1975); see also Juan F. By and Through Lynch v. Welcker,\n37 F.3d at 878; Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizen_; v, King, 688\nF.2d at 608-09. The Trial Court was entitled to rely upon circumstances\nsurrounding the signing of the Settlement Agreement in 1986 and the course of\naction of the parties in implementing the Settlement Agreement once signed to\nconstrue the parties expected overall objectives. See Pearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d\n401, 409 (lst Cir. 1991); Navarro-Ayala, 951 F.2d at 1343 n. 21;_S_ 3\nCorbin, Corbin on Contracts § 558, at 249-253 (1960). In addition, in public\nreform litigation, as here, state officials taking office are bound by a consent\ndecree entered into by their predecessors inoffice; see Newman v. Graddick, 740\nF.2d 1513, 1517-18 (llth Cir. 1984), _ United States v. Swift, 286 U.S.\n106 (1932); and the practical construction given to the decree as evidenced by the\nconduct of each successive administration bears upon the parties' objectives of\nthe consent decree for enforcement purposes. See .N.avarro-Avala, 951 F.2d at\n1356 n. 37 (Cyr, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nThe DMR leadership abided by the terms of the Settlement Agreement\nin response to JRC up until August, 1993. For example, between 1986 and\n1991, then DMR Commissioner McCarthy had an ongoing working relationship\nwith Dr. Daignault as Court Monitor wherein they resolved numerous issues\nconcerning JRC's licensure and certification pursuant to Paragraph B-2 of the\nSettlement Agreement. DMR General Counsel Murdock attended a number of\nthese meetings. Likewise, on March 22, 1993, General Counsel Murdock cited\nCommissioner Campbell's obligations and the Settlement Agreement, when she\n_s There, however, the court did not construe the actions of the defendants\nsubsequent to the decree as clearly representing that the parties intended it to apply to\nother hospitals in addition to the one expressly named in the decree, and, therefore,\nreversed the finding of contempt.

The Commissioner was aware that his certification\nre_lations were subject to the Settlement Aereemenl\nThe Commissioner asserts that since Paragraph B-2 allows the Court\nMonitor to oversee all regulations \"except to the extent that those regulations\ninvolved treatment procedures authorized by the Court in accordance with\nPart A, N the certification regulations pertaining to aversive treatments are\nexcluded from the Court Monitor's review under Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement\nAgreement and, unlike all other state regulations, rest within his exclusive\ndomain.\nThis argument contradicts the express terms of the Settlement Agreement.\nAt the time the Settlement Agreement was approved, DMH had not yet adopted\nthe behavior modification regulations at 104 CMR §20.15, governing the\nCommissioner's certification process, which were adopted later in 1987. Part A\nprovides that the Trial Court shall decide the use of aversive treatments on an\nindividual student basis using the substituted judgment criteria. (App. 121-125).\nThe exception in Paragraph B-2 was not a purposeful attempt to restore\nregulatory power upon the Commonwealth in one area; rather, it was a\nrestriction to prevent an intrusion by the Court Monitor upon a power reserved\nfor the Trial Court.

(App. 81). To suggest that the parties\nwould have then contemplated a resolution of the case whereby the same issues\nwhich gave rise to the original conflict were bound to reoccur is an irrational\ninterpretation of the Settlement Agreement.\nThis after-the-fact argument that the certification regulations are\nexempted from the coverage of the Settlement Agreement is also dramatically\ndifferent from the position which the Commissioner and his staff asserted\nregarding the application of Paragraph B-2 to his certification regulations\nsubsequent to their adoption and prior to the contempt litigation. S(_, e._.g.,\nExhibit U-41) (acknowledging that the Department was bound by a Settlement\nAgreement and its role in \"actual treatment\" was limited.) 16 The Commissioner\nadmitted at trial that from 1987 to August, 1993, the Trial Court exercised\nexclusive control over approving JRC's treatment without participation or\nobjection from DMR. fir. Ill, 36-37).\nThe Commissioner creates this revisionist argument in an eftbrt to justify\nhis attempt to close the JRC program based on his personal ideological and\npolitical views, which action he knows was otherwise impossible under the\nSettlement Agreement. However, the Commissioner isbound and his regulatory\nactions are limited by the terms of the Settlement Agreement even if treatment\ndecisions of the Trial Court do not meet his standards. See Palmigiano v.\nDiPrete, 700 F.Supp. at 1195 (fact that prison conditions meet threshold Eighth\n_ Similarly, on March 15, 1993, Deputy Counsel Chow-Menzer wrote to\nDr. Daignault and stated that under the Settlement Agreement, \"the Court Monitor is\nresponsible for overseeing B.R.I.'s treatment and educational program,\" and that the\n\"settlement agreement clearly reflects the understanding of the Court and the signatory\nparties in yourability asthe appointed Court Monitor tomake the threshold determination\non whethera B.R.I. treatment program was presenting a serious risktothe BRI student.\"\nCtJ-65).\n73\n\nAmendmensttandardnsotapplicablewherepartiesagreetodifferensttandards\ninconsendtecree)L.ikewiset,heCommissioncearnnortelitigatetheissueofthe\nwaiverofcertainregulatorypowersundertheSettlemenAtgreement, even if he\nbelieves that it unlawfully curtails his statutorily-imposed powers as\nCommissioner or he no longer agrees with its mandates and framework. See\nUnited States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752, 756-57 (1983) (no collateral attack on\njudgment underlying orders); accord, Commonwealth v, Fall River Motor Sales,\nInc., 409 Mass. 302, 312 (1991).\nUntil August of 1993, the Commissioner deferred to the Trial Court on\nthe implementation of all treatment decisions, even after the adoption of the\nbehavior modification regulations. He did not exercise regulatory authority over\nJRC in a unilateral fashion, but accepted the framework imposed by the\nSettlement Agreement both for treatment decisions and dispute resolution. The\nCommissioner now adopts an interpretation of the Settlement Agreement which\nis not only textually and legally inaccurate, but also blatantly inconsistent with\nhis prior actions and his previous interpretations of the very same provisions of\nthe Settlement Agreement.\nD. The Trial Court Correctly Concluded That The Commissioner\nViolated The Express Terms And Overall Objectives Of\nNumerous Provisions Of The Settlement Agreement\n1. The Commissioner's regulatory action constitutes\ncontempt of Part A\nAs DMR itself has acknowledged, the Settlement Agreement resulted in\nDMR having limited authority in treatment decisions. The Commissioner is\ncorrect when he asserts that the substituted judgment determination does not, i.12Lq\nfacto, authorize the use of procedures which are deemed to be violative of state\nlaw. However, the Commissioner's analogy to the medical institution operating\nwithout state licensure ignores the fact that the Commonwealth in the present\ncase, unlike in the Commissioner's example, waived its right to unilaterally\ndetermine which treatments could be used at JRC when it signed the Settlement\n74\n\nAgreemenatndthatitistheTrialC._urtn,ottheCommissionewr,hichisinthe\npositionofauthorizinpgarticulartreatmentfsorparticularclientsI.r\nTheCommissionehr,oweverw, asnotpowerlestsovoicehisconcerns\nintheeventthathebelievedthattreatmenptrocedurewserebeingimproperly\nutilizedatJRC. IntheMemorandumapprovingtheSettlemenAtgreement in\n1987, the Trial Court specifically found that the framework of the Settlement\nAgreement would provide all parties with an opportunity for adequate review of\ntreatment decisions. (S.A. 20-21). Indeed, under the Settlement Agreement,\nDMR possessed two avenues for relief. First, DMR could utilize the dispute\nresolution procedures of Paragraph B-2 by bringing any concerns over approved\ntreatments to the attention of the Court Monitor and, in turn, to the attention of\nthe Trial Court. This process had been followed by DMR in the past. Second,\nDMR could have participated and presented evidence in the substituted judgment\ncases pursuant to Part A.tt\nDMR chose neither of these legal approaches. Instead, without seeking\nto modify the Settlement Agreement, and without even notifying the Trial Court\nof its changed position, DMR unilaterally ordered JRC to cease using treatment\nprocedures approved by the Trial Court as part of individual treatment plans\npursuant to Part A. According to the Commissioner's new position, the Trial\nCourt was powerless to approve the use of any aversive therapy not certified by\nthe Commissioner, and JRC was unable to use any therapy not certified by the\nCommissioner even where approved by the Trial Court. This is the exact\nregulatory power which was modified with the signing of the Settlement\n_7 The Commissioner's analogy fails for another reason. There is no state law\nwhich prohibits aversive therapy inthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts; nordoDMR's\nbehavior modification regulations prohibit the type of treatments at JRC. The behavior\nmodification regulationslimit the Commissioner's authority tocertifying a \"program\" to\nuse interventions based on the stated criteriaof v,hether the program \"has the capacity\ntoimplement\" the aversive procedures. 104CMR 20.15(4)(1\")(1). Stated simply, this is\nnot a case where the licensee is arguing that it is permitted to by-pass a state law\nproscribing certain activities because of language contained in a settlement agreement.\nJs DMR was alsoaware of this route. Although from 1987 until 1993, there had\nbeen virtually noparticipation insubstituted judgment hearings by DMR. Following the\ncommencement of the regulatorybarrage in 1993, DMR began toparticipate intreatment\nhearing and tocontest treatments. (S.A. 45_66).\n75\n\nAgreement in 1987. Part A of the Settlement Agreement was intended to provide\nthe Trial Court with the exclusive authority to determine the propriety of aversive\ntreatments in order: 1) to ensure that treatments which were necessary for the\nhealth and safety of the students were not unilaterally terminated by an arbitrary\ndecision by State oflicials as had occurred in 1985; and 2) to ensure that the\nrights of the ward were protected by employing substituted judgment criteria in\napproving approval of any aversive therapy. The Commissioner's unilateral\nwithholding of approval for aversive therapies which therapies had been approved\nby the Trial Court violated the Settlement Agreement in commencing his\nregulatory war of attrition against JRC.\nThe Commissioner undertook a series of bogus regulatory actions to\nforce a piecemeal termination of JRC's use of aversive treatments. First, in\nAugust 1993, the Commissioner provided interim certification for a period of\ntv,'enty-five days of only those aversive treatments currently in use by JRC under\nCourt-approved treatment plans, but denied certification of any additional\ntherapies approved under Part A but not in use on that specific date as part of a\ntreatment plan. (U-91). Second, on January 20, 1995, the Commissioner\nspecifically excluded from his certification all Level III interventions Court-\napproved for six JRC students. (U-166). In effect, this action by the\nCommissioner constituted an unlawful administrative \"substituted judgment\"\ndetermination for six JRC students. Third, the Commissioner also ordered JRC\nin the January 20 Letter to cease using four specified Level I11treatments on all\nstudents, although all four had been previously approved by the Trial Court\npursuant to Part A for certain students, l_'\nFinally, on March 23, 1995, the Commissioner completely decertified the\nJRC program thereby purporting to terminate JRC's ability to use all aversive\ntreatments, (U-179), which forced JRC to seek and obtain a status .q.o.Qinjunction\nt9 Apart from a violation of Part A of the Settlement Agreement, the\nCommissioner's unilateral termination of aversive treatments as ordered in his January\n20 Letter, was not authorized or otherwise sanctioned by any of the Commissioner's\nbehavior modification regulations, which speak only to the certification of \"programs\"\nemploying Level 11Itreatments, and not to the certification of individual treatments or\nindividual clients receiving treatments.\n76\n\nfromtheTrial Court in order to continue with its treatment program. (S.A_\n127). These events were hauntingly reminiscent of the scenario in 1985 and\n1986. The Commissioner's unilateral termination of treatments by withholding\ncertification is exactly the type of conduct against which the Settlement\nAgreement was intended to protect and a direct violation of Part A.\n2. The Commissioner's regulatory actions constit_t!¢,,\ncontemot of Paragraph B-2\nIf the Commissioner had any legitimate concerns over the treatment\nprograms administered at JRC in 1993, he was required under the Settlement\nAgreement to invoke the dispute resolution procedure and have his concerns\naddressed according to the process set forth in Paragraph B-2. Instead, in the\nsummer of 1993, the Commissioner simply concluded that he would ignore the\nmandate of Paragraph B-2. This action was directly contrary to the conduct of\nthe Commissioner prior to August of 1993 and the conduct of his predecessor\nwho did defer to the regulatory authority of Dr. Daignault as the Court Monitor\nand did adhere to the dispute resolution procedures in Paragraph B-2.\nUntil August of 1993, all of the parties remained cognizant of the order\nof Judge Rotenberg issued in his Memorandum on Febt'uary 12, 1987: \"Lstly,\nall parties are reminded of the Monitor's role as outlined in the Settlement\nAgreement, insofar as all conflicts or disputes, shall be brought initially to the\nMonitor for attempted resolution.\" (App. 134). Contrary to the Commissioner's\nargument, it matters little whether JRC invoked the word \"mediate\" or\n\"arbitrate\" when it requested the Commissioner and his Department to resolve\ndisputes under the Settlement Agreement, because in every request JRC and\nDr. Daignault specifically invoked or made reference to Paragraph B-2 or the\nSettlement Agreement. :° At no time, did the Commissioner or his\n:o Shortly after the Commissioner's August 6 Letter, JRC invoked the dispute\nresolution provisions of Paragraph B-2 in a communication of August 27, 1993. (JRC-\n246). The Comraissioner's counsel responded bystating, inconelusory fashion, that the\nCommissioner's \"historical understanding\" of the Settlement Agreeraent was \"not what\nyour letter sets forth.\" (U-90). On October 15, 1993, Dr. Daignault sent a letter to\nGeneral CounselMurdock which stated the following: \"ltruly cannot see how mediation\ncan be reinstitutedunless the Department revises its position or, at thevery least, makes\n77\n\nrepresentativiensformJRCor Dr. Daignaultthat they did not understand the\nword \"mediation\" to refer to the arbitration provisions inParagraph B-2. Rather,\non October 14, 1993, General Counsel Murdock stated in a letter to\nDr. Daignault: \"The Department has consistently maintained that it does not\nagree that the Settlement Agreement requires it to submit to mediation or\narbitration by our ofl_ce whenever requested by B.R.I.\" (U-II0, 2).2j The\nCommissioner cannot assert that it was JRC's failure to use the key word\n\"arbitrate\" which accounted for his refusal to abide by the Settlement Agreement.\nIndeed, it was the Commissioner's undisclosed position throughout this period\nthat he was not even a party to the Settlement Agreement. From August, 1993\nuntil trial, the Commissioner, as he admitted at trial, consistently refused to\nresolve disputes pursuant to Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement Agreement, despite\nrepeated requests by JRC. (Tr. 11, 30-34).\nUntil August of 1993, Commissioners McCarthy and Campbell and other\nhigh-ranking DMR officials complied with Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement\nAgreement by, among other things, the following: consulting with the Court\nMonitor about the proposed behavior modification regulations' consistency with\nthe obligations in the Settlement Agreement prior to promulgating the\nregulations; attending (in the case of Commissioner McCarthy) at least seven\nan unequivocalcommitment to the process of mediation with the full \"knowledgethatthe\nSettlement Agreement mandates submission of any issues to the Court which has failed\nto resolve inmediation.\" (JRC-251). JRC made the same request of the Commissioner\nafter he continually refused to arbitrate under the Settlement Agreement: \"B.R.I. is\nprepared to engage in future mediation sessions under Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement\nAgreement if DMR is prepared to state unequivocally that it will comply with the\nmediation provisions including the submission of issues to the Court for resolution upon\nunsuccessful mediation.\" (JRC-276). In response, the Commissioner's counsel, on\nOctober 21, 1993, expressly refused to \"waive our interpretation of the Settlement\nAgreement, asyou requested.\" (U-It4).\n2, Similarly, on September 17, 1993, General Counsel Murdock wrote to Dr.\nDaignault and stated: \"As you know, the Department of Mental Retardation does not\nagree with the Settlement Agreement's provisions concerning the monitor contemplated,\nthe monitor's arbitration ofdisputes, such as thosealleged inB.R.I.'a recent Court filing,\nnor the attendant resolution by a probate court referenced in your letter.\" (U-98). On\nNovember 16, 1993, the Commissioner's counsel stated in a letter to JRC that \"The\nSettlement Agreement only contemplates mediation of disputes regarding a B.R.I.\nstudent's placement or treatment.\" (U-124).\n78\n\nmeetingwsithDr.Daignault and holding numerous telephone conversations with\nDr. Daignault on her private line regarding JRC's regulatory issues; meeting with\nDr. Daignault and allowing him to facilitate the first set of group home licenses\nissued by DMR toJRC; arbitrating DMR's disputes with JRC with Dr. Daignault\nover licensing, placement and other regulatory issues; requesting Dr. Daignault's\nadvice in May of 1990 on how to seek termination of the Settlement Agreement;\nreferring abuse allegations regarding JRC's treatment to Dr. Daignault for his\ninvestigation; acknowledging to third parties that the DMR's involvement in\nJRC's treatment is \"limited\" and referring inquiries to Dr. Daignault; and as\nrecently as March of 1993, seeking guidance under the Settlement Agreement,\nbefore testifying on proposed legislation. 03-67). In short, the Trial Court was\nfully justified in concluding that the Commissioner and DMR complied with\nParagraph B-2 of the Settlement Agreement up until August of 1993, and then\nabruptly and without justification, repeatedly violated Paragraph B-2.\n3. The Commissioner's regulatgry actions constitute\ncontempt of Part (_\nThe terms of Part C, ¶ 3, prohibit DMR from interfering with JRC's\nintake of clients, whose funding provides the economic basis for operating IRC.\nIn 1985 when OFC closed intake at JRC, the result was economic deterioration\nsince OFC had shut off JRC's funding sources.\nThe Commissioner sent contrived certification letters containing false\nallegations of wrongdoing and abuse by JRC staff (including Dr. Israel) to JRC's\nFunding and Placement Agencies which referred new clients to JRC and which\nsubsidized existing clients. The Commissioner admitted at trial and the notes of\nthe Weekly Meetings reflected that DMR officials had meetings and discussions\nwith officials from JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies about JRC finding\nalternative placements for JRC clients and about JRC's \"litigation\" with DMR.\n(U-91). The Commissioner admitted to preventing JRC representatives or even\nneutrals from attending a meeting with JRC's New York funding and placement\nagency. (13-138). Commissioner Campbell admitted that DMR officials\nencouraged JRC parents to remove their children from JRC. (Tr. IV, 238-240).\n79\n\nThefactthatJRC'senrollmendtroppedfrom66 students to 43 students from\n1993 to the time of trial, after a significant growth trend from 1987 to 1993, is\nample evidence that the success of the Commissioner's efforts to interfere with\nintake. The Commissioner admitted that he departed from his usual practice\nwhen he sent a letter to JRC and JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies in\nwhich he stated that there were serious allegations of abuse involving Dr. Israel\npersonally. (U-106). tie admitted that he would have concerns about placing a\nclient in a program if he received such a letter. Cir. III, 187-188). When the\nallegations against Dr. Israel were not substantiated, the Commissioner failed to\nre-contact the funding agencies. (Tr. 111, 191-193).\nIt simply cannot be the case that the Settlement Agreement solely\nprohibited a literal order to close intake and did not prohibit the type of indirect\naction of the Commissioner which would achieve the same practical result. The\nTrial Court properly concluded that the Commissioner's actions constituted a\npurposeful attempt to financially destroy ]RC by cutting off the flow of new\nstudents. The Court was fully warranted in concluding that this action interfered\nwith the intake of new students in violation of the objectives of Part C, ¶ 3.\n4. The Commissioner violated the good faith provision in\nThe Commissioner further argues that the good faith provision in Part L\nof the Settlement Agreement is \"too ambiguous\" to be the basis for contempt.\nThis view isconsistent with his DMR's position at trial, wherein DMR's present\ncounsel stated in her opening statement that DMR had no obligation under the\nSettlement Agreement to act in good faith. (Tr. 1, 66). The Trial Court\nresponded that it was \"appalled that a senior member of the Office of the\nAttorney General, representing an agency which issupposed to serve the people\nof the Commonwealth, could seriously contend that there was no obligation for\nher client to act in good faith.\" (App. 1293).\nThe Commissioner mischaracterizes the Trial Court's decision and\napplicable legal principles when he states on page 54 of his Brief that \"any\nimplicit finding of contempt based upon the violation of the good faith provision\n80\n\naloneshouldbereverseadsamatteorflaw.\" Asdiscusseadbovet,heevidence\nsupportstheTrialCourt'sfindingthattheCommissionevirolatedanumbeorf\nthesubstantivperovisionsof theSettlemenAtgreement. The evidence also\nsupports that the Commissioner intentionally violated the good faith provision in\nPart L by engaging in conduct such as: ignoring and secreting the\nrecommendation of the 1991 and 1993 Certification Teams; publishing\ncertification letters and other statements rife with false and defamatory statements\nabout JRC to JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies; misrepresenting\ninformation concerning JRC to the Trial Court in the fraudulent Report to the\nCourt; departing from his own regulations by withholding certification of Level\nII1 treatments for individual students; departing from his ordinary practice by\nholding Weekly Meetings to plot strategy to bring about JRC's downfall; and\nharassing the Court Monitor and Guardian _ Briggs with baseless\naccusations of improprieties. The Commissioner's intention to close the JRC\nprogram was not simply a subjective desire. The Commissioner acted on his bad\nfaith by implementing his regulatory authority over JRC in a perverse manner in\nviolation of both the Settlement Agreement and the public interest. It was for\nthis reason that the Commissioner's actions constituted \"pervasive public\ncorruption.\" (App. 1310).\nThe legal arguments of the Commissioner regarding the application of the\nexpress good faith provision are also misplaced. Courts interpreting similar\n\"good faith\" provisions in consent decrees have determined that such clauses\nrequire the parties to use their best efforts to accomplish the stated and intended\nobjectives of the agreement. See United States v. Board of Education of the City\nof Chica.g.Q, 799 F.2d 281,292 (7th Cir. 1986). The Commissioner miscites the\nSeventh Circuit in United States v. Board of Education of the City of Chicagg,\n717 F.2d. 378 (7th Cir. 1983), when he states at pages 55 and 56 of his Brief\nthat the court held that the good-faith provision in the consent decree was too\nambiguous for enforcement. There, although the court ruled that the term\n\"available funds\" and what constituted \"available\" was capable of more than one\nmeaning, the court held that the good faith provision requiring the parties to use\ntheir best efforts to effectuate desegregation of the Chicago public schools was\n81\n\nnotin theleastambiguouosr \"nebulous.\"Id_.a_t_3.82. Further,theCourtin\nUnited States v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 744 F.2d at 1306-\n1308, held that legislative lobbying activities by the executive branch intending\nto decrease funding available to desegregation programs \"eontraven[edl the spirit\nof the decree\" and would be a violation of the express good-faith provision\nsubject to contempt sanctions. Nothing in the cases cited by the Commissioner\nsupports his argument that the good faith provision in Part L does not impose any\nduty upon him.\nThe Commissioner also relies on Brennan v. The Governor, 405 Mass.\n398 (1989), to justify his actions as a proper application of his discretionary\nregulatory authority which he asserts cannot be attacked on the grounds that he\ndid not act according to the highest standards. In addition to the Commissioner\nomitting the entire quotation from the opinion in his Brief, the facts and subject\nmatter of Brennan, sup&_, make it inapplicable to this case. There, this Court\nheld that officials had the authority to give priority to a site for a state prison\nwhich the officials believed, in the proper exercise of their discretion, was the\nbest location to address state needs. Id. at 396-398. This is the standard of\nreview applied to challenges to a public official's choice of sites for municipal\nbuilding contracts, which necessarily involve an element of discretionary\ndecision-making by a public official. The holding in _, u_, is\ncompletely inapplicable to this case where the Commissioner as a state officer\nviolated a court-ordered Settlement Agreement in a concerted effort to shut-down\na private facility.\nEven assuming, ar_uendo, that the Commissioner's actions were not in\nbad faith and taken merely as part of the implementation of his regulatory power,\nwhich is wholly contrary to the record in this case, the Commissioner as a party\nhad a legal obligation to comply with the Settlement Agreement regardless of his\nmotives. See Palmigiano v. DiPrete, 700 F.Supp. at 1194, _ McComb v.\nJacksonville Paoer Co., 336 U.S. 187, 191 (1949); _ _Fortin v.\nCommissioner of Massachusetts Dept. of Public Welfare, 692 F.2d at 796 ('good\nfaith is not a defense to civil contempt'). It is for this reason that the\nCommissioner's argument that he acted on advice of counsel also fails.\n82\n\nLikewisee,ven if this Court somehow determines that the Commissioner did not\nviolate any of the express substantive provisions of the Settlement Agreement,\nthe Commissioner's course of conduct after August of 1993 was action in\ncontravention of the objectives of the Settlement Agreement. n As stated by the\nFirst Circuit:\nlTlhe underlying principle is equally applicable here: officials\noperating under a public law decree are required to employ good\nfaith efforts to satisfy its demands, and fault should not be found\nif they have implemented its dictates to the extent practicable.\nLangton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d at 1223, _ Board of Education v. Dowell,\n498 U.S. 237, 249-250 (1991).\nHere, the converse is true. The Commissioner is at fault because he\nfailed to implement the dictates and follow the demands of the Settlement\nAgreement to any extent following August of 1993. Not only did the\nCommissioner fail to display any eftbrt to engage in substantial compliance with\nthe overall mandates of the Settlement Agreement after that date, but he also\nwillfully violated its express terms. As set forth above, this is not a case where\nthe Commissioner was confused about his obligations. He and his agency\nfollowed the Agreement for five years until the Commissioner decided it was no\nlonger in his interests to do so. He ignored warnings from Court officials and\nviolated mediation agreements supervised by Court-appointed officials. The\nassertion by the Commissioner that the Trial Court should have given him the\nopportunity to bring his regulatory powers into compliance with the Settlement\nAgreement ignores the fact that the Trial Court did provide numerous chances\nfor resolution of the controversy. The conduct of the Commissioner, however,\nshowed that he was bent on destroying JRC regardless of who or what was in his\nway.\nu Assuming that the Settlement Agreement did not contain an express and\nunambiguous good faith provision, the Commissioner had a duty not to breach the\nimplied covenant of goodfaith and fair dealing contained inall contractsby engaging in\nconduct intended to contravene the spirit of compromise and circumvent substantive\nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement. See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC\nAssociates. 411 Mass. 451,471 (1991).\n83\n\nThereismore than sufficient factual evidence to support the Trial Court's\nfindings of lack of good faith. The unambiguous record in this case reveals\nnothing less than a carefully conceived plan to use every means possible to\naccomplish indirectly what the Commissioner could not achieve lawfully under\nthe Settlement Agreement -- the destruction of JRC and the elimination of its\ntreatment. The findings of the Trial Court show that the Commissioner\nundertook a regulatory war of attrition using his unlimited resources to meet his\nobjective of obliterating a non-profit agency. The Commissioner utilized the\npower of the Commonwealth for a perverse purpose; to lay regulatory siege to\na treatment program which was lawfully providing treatment to a vulnerable\ngroup of severely handicapped students. It is hard to imagine a more blatant\nexample of bad faith.\n5. The Trial Court did not shift the burden of proof to the\nCommissioner to prove his good failh\nThe Trial Court did not rule on the first day of trial that the\nCommissioner would have the burden of proving a good faith basis for his\nregulatory acti_,ities. As is evidenced by review of the testimony, the Trial\nCourt's comments came following the testimony of Deputy Counsel Casey, who\ndescribed the thoroughness of the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports and the\nunequivocal recommendations of certification contained therein. Deputy Counsel\nCasey admitted that the work of his certification teams and the recommendations\ncontained in the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports were untruthfully depicted\nin the Commissioner's Report to the Court which the Commissioner filed with\nthe Trial Court on September 22, 1993. The Trial Court also saw, for the first\ntime, the actual Certification Reports of 1991 and 1993. The results of the 1991\nand 1993 Certification Reports were falsely described in the Commissioner's\nReport to the Court and copies of the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports were\nomitted from the exhibit binder (which contained twenty other exhibits). The\nReport to the Court did not even make reference to the fact that conclusions of\nthe certification team had been reduced to writing.\n84\n\nInresponsteo the testimony of Deputy Counsel Casey in regards to the\nReport to the Court, the Trial Judge requested an explanation for the \"flagrant\nmisrepresentation to the court.\" (Tr. 1, 179). Attorney Judith Yogman,\nAssistant Attorney General and the Commissioner's trial counsel, rose to address\nthe Trial Court's concerns, and requested from the Trial Court an opportunity to\nexplain the omissions with later testimony from the Commissioner. Attorney\nYogman also assured the Trial Court that \"there is ample basis for all of the\nCommissioner's statements and they will be provided by people other than\nMr. Casey.\" fir. I, 180). In showing great restraint, the Trial Court\nresponded: \"1am faced with misrepresentations to the court and 1 welcome an\nexplanation why it should not be characterized in that way, and ! am looking\nforward to it and 1 hope that it is present,_l soon.\" fir. I, 181). Again,\nAttorney Yogman assured the Trial Court that the Commissioner would provide\nthe evidence to rebut the obvious fraud stating, _As soon as we have an\nopportunity to present our case, Your Honor, we will.\" (Tr. I, 181). The\nCommissioner never gave a credible explanation for the fraud he perpetrated.\nIndeed, he was compelled to concede in his testimony that the recommendations\nof the certification teams were inaccurately set forth in his Report to the Court.\n(Tr. III, 179-182).\nThe Trial Court did not shift the burden on the Commissioner to prove\nhis good faith. Rather, the judge rightfully requested DMR to provide an\nexplanation for materials which, on their face and by the testimony of a DMR\nDeputy Counsel, evidenced that DMR had perpetrated a fraud upon the Court.\nSee Rockdale Management Co.. Inc. v. Shawmut Bank, N.A., 4t8 Mass. 596,\n598 (1994) (trial judge has broad discretion to take action in response to\nfraudulent conduct and to fashion judicial response warranted by fraud). Once\nJRC presented evidence of a orima facie case of fraud, the burden shifted to the\nCommissioner to present evidence to rebut the evidence of the latent misconduct\nand bad faith adduced by JRC. Sge.eFeord Motor Co. v. Barrett, 403 Mass. 240,\n242-43 (1988) (citations omitted); _ Liacos, Handbook of Massachu_¢lts\n_Evidence §5.6.2, p.225 (6th ed. 1994).

Theargumentht attheCourtshiftedtheburden\nofprooftotheCommissioneisrtotallydevoidofanymerit.\nII. THETRIALCOURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN ITS\nEVIDENTIARY RULINGS\nThe Commissioner's bare assertion that the trial was \"replete with\nevidentiary errors\" without arguing any more than three alleged evidentiary\nmistakes by the Trial Court is not sufficient to raise an issue on appeal regarding\nany other alleged unnamed errors. See Mass. R. App. P. 16(a)(4); see also\nManchester v. Dept. of Environmental Ouality Eneineerin_z, 381 Mass. 208,214\nn. 7 (1980); Capodilupo v. Petringa, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 893, 894 (1977) (bare\nassertion of error is not argument). Nevertheless, the Trial Court did not abuse\nits discretion in making the evidentiary rulings contested by the Commissioner.\nEven if there were error, the Commissioner has failed to show that such\nrelatively minor evidentiary rulings in the course of a thirteen day trial materially\naffected the outcome so as to require the reversal of the entire judgment. See\nMass. R. Civ. P. 61; see also DeJesus v. Yo_el, 404 Mass. 44, 48-50 (1989);\nSaunders v. Goodman, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 617-18 n. 4 (1979);\nGrant, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 965, 965 (1982).\nA. The Trial Court Did Not Err In Refusing To Extend\nDiscovery\nJRC filed its initial complaint on September 3, 1993, yet, the\nCommissioner did not conduct any depositions of any witnesses until April of\n1995, on the eve of trial. He finally noticed depositions for consecutive days\nv,-hich, ',,,'hen combined with JRC's depositions, resulted in successive days of\ndepositions right up to the discovery deadline of May 3, 1995. The\nCommissioner had noticed nine depositions in October of 1993, which he\nsubsequently cancelled, showing that he was aware of his discovery rights in\n1993. (S.A. 96-115). On April 11, 1995, the Commissioner notified JRC of its\nintention to take the deposition of JRC, pursuant to Mass. R. Cir. P. 30(b)(6),\n\"by the person with the most knowledge with regard to the factual basis of the\nallegations contained in the Third Amended Contempt Complaint.\" (App. 510).\n86\n\n(emphasiasdded).Thiswastheextentofthedescriptionofthematterosnwhich\ntheCommissioneprroposedto examineatthedeposition.TheCommissioner\nservedJRCwitheightdepositionnoticesonApril 11, 1995, and he scheduled the\naforementioned 30(b)(6) deposition for the last day of discovery on\nMay 3, 1995.23 JRC responded to the Commissioner's vague 30(0)(6)\ndeposition request by producing on May 3 and May 10, 1995 Dr. Israel, the\nExecutive Director of JRC, who demonstrated both at the 30(0)(6) deposition and\nat trial that he was extremely knowledgeable about the allegations contained in\nthe Third Amended Complaint as the signatory on the Verification. Counsel for\nJRC advised the Commissioner's counsel at the beginning and at the end of the\n30(0)(6) deposition that the Notice of deposition lacked particularity. (S.A. 126;\nApp. 531). The Commissioner's counsel acknowledged at the end of the\n30(0)(6) deposition that she had run out of time under the discovery deadline.\n(App. 531).\nThe Massachusetts version of Rule 30(0)(6), like its Federal counterpart,\nallows a party to name a corporation as a deponent in a notice of deposition \"and\ndescribe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is\nrequested.\" The intent of the Federal Rule 30(b)(6), as amended in 1970, in\nrequiring the party seeking to depose a corporation to state with particularity the\nsubject matter of the examination rather than name the actual person to be\ndeposed was to curb prior practice whereby the examining party would designate\na corporate official to be deposed, only to find out that such corporate official\nhad no information regarding subjects 1obe examined.._ Notes of Advisory\nCommittee to 1970 Amt_ndment to Federal Rule 30; see also Protective.Nat.

Ind. 1992).\nHere, however, the Commissioner's general notice of deposition to IRC\ndid not state with any reasonable particularity the subjects on which he intended\nto examine. The request to depose the _person\" with the most knowledge of \"the\nfactual basis of the allegations contained in a Third Amended Contempt\nComplaint\" isnowhere near particular enough to put JRC on notice of the subject\nmatter of the deposition in order to supply the person or persons who would be\nable to respond to such questioning. Contrast Marker v. Union Fidelily Life Ins.\nCo., 125 F.R.D. at 126; see also Protective Nat. Ins. v, Commonwealth Ins.,\n137 F.R.D. at 278. In United States V. Gahagan Dredging Corp, 24 F.R.D.\n328, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 1958), the court held that the defendant's notice to take the\ntestimony of \"the plaintiff by its officer familiar with the matters alleged in the\ncomplaint\" was not sufficient under the prior Rule 30 requiring \"reasonable\nnotice\" to the person sought to be examined. Similarly, in park and Tilford\nDistillers Corp, v. Distillers Co., 19 F.R.D. 169, 171 (S.D.N.Y. 1956), the\ncourt ruled that notices seeking to take the deposition of the plaintiff through\n\"such other directors, officers or employees as have knowledge or information\nconcerning the matters or any of them referred to in the complaint\" was not\nsufficient.\nIt was not the duty of JRC to provide a parade of standby witnesses ready\nto answer questions on any and all subjects which may have arisen during the\ncourse of the deposition or to anticipate the Commissioner's trial strategy or what\nfacts the Commissioner considered relevant to the allegations contained in the\ncontempt complaint. The Commissioner and his counsel cannot and should not\nblame either JRC or the Trial Court for their improper noticing of the deposition.\nThe Trial Court acted well-within its broad discretion in denying the request for\nan extension of discovery and delay in the trial. See Bishop v. Klein, 380 Mass.\n285, 288 (1980); Solimene v. B. Orauel & Co.. KG, 399 Mass. 790, 799\n(1987).\n88\n\nLikewiset,hereisnoshowingthattheCommissionewrasprejudicebdy\ntheinabilitytodeposeMr. Arthur Mullen, the JRC accountant with knowledge\nof the impact of the Commissioner's actions since 1993 on JRC's financial\ncondition. The Commissioner was well aware that JRC alleged economic harm\nas a direct result of the Commissioner's contemptuous conduct, and was on\nnotice that JRC would present evidence of such harm at trial. JRC designated\nMr. Mullen as an expert witness and submitted an offer of proof as to the basis\nand substance of his proposed testimony regarding the financial condition of JRC\non June 26, 1995, more than one week before Mr. Mullen testified. (S.A. 68).\nThis is not a situation where DMR was surprised or ambushed by the last\nminute, bad faith designation of an expert witness whose testimony DMR had no\nopportunity to counter. See Wilson v. Honeywell. Inc., 409 Mass. 803, 809-10\n(1991); Egan v. Marr Scaftblding Co., 14 Mass. App. Ct. 1036, 1036 (1982).\nIn contrast, the Commissioner listed over 120 witnesses, including numerous\npsychologists and physicians on his pre-trial witnesses, knowing full well that it\nwould be impossible for JRC to depose all the witnesses for trial or even\ndetermine which of the witnesses the tgommissioner might actually call at trial.\nB, The Trial Court Did Not Err In Limiting The Presentation of\nEvidence\nThe Commissioner invokes the doctrine of curative admissibility to argue\nthat he had a right to introduce evidence otherwise inadmissible to rebut\n\"prejudicial evidence\" presented by JRC, and argues that the Trial Court's denial\nof this right constituted reversible error. The Commissioner misstates the\nstandard. Curative admissibility is a rule whereby if one party introduces,\nwithout objection, evidence that is inadmissible and immaterial, not merely\nprejudicial, it is within the discretion of the trial court to permit the opposing\nparty to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence to contradict the party's\noriginal submission. Se.__gLeiacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence,\n§ 3.13.1, pp. 106-107. It isgenerally not error for a trial court to refuse a party\nto re;pond with inadmissible evidence:\nA trial judge cannot be compelled to listen to the trial of\nimmaterial issues which in his judgment would prolong the tr'al,\n89\n\nconfusethejury, andmakelikelyanunjustresult.Thesettled\nruleisthattheintroductionorexclusionofimmateriaelvidence\ntomeetimmateriaelvidenceiswithinthediscretionofthecourt.\nGoodyear Park Co, v. Holyoke, 298 Mass. 510, 511-512 (1937) (internal\nquotations and citations omitted). The Commissioner's reliance on this doctrine\nis misplaced. In any event, there is no showing that the Trial Court abused its\ndiscretion, or denied the Commissioner an opportunity to present his case. _\nFirst, the evidence of the negative effect of the termination of the\nSpecialized Food Program on the health and safety of certain students at JRC\nwho relied upon this treatment was ,_gt inadmissible, making the doctrine\ninapplicable to this evidence. The Commissioner had ordered the Specialized\nFood Program terminated in his January 20 Letter, alleging a good faith basis to\ndo so after investigating the abusive effects which this allegedly scientifically\nunrecognized aversive treatment was having on the students. The evidence of the\ndebilitating effect which the termination of the program had caused to student\nJ.C. was direct evidence to refute the Commissioner's January 20 Letter and to\nprove that his certification decision regarding this therapy was unsubstantiated,\narbitrary, and a fraudulent imposition of his regulatory authority. In addition,\nthis was direct evidence to show that protection against such unilateral\ntermination of treatments by the state agencies was the exact reason why the\nparties had entered into the Settlement Agreement in 1987, and that the\nCommissioner's unilateral regulatory activities directly contravened the terms and\noverall objectives of the Settlement Agreement. Finally, the evidence was\nrelevant as bearing directly on the multifaceted harm caused by the\nCommissioner's bad faith regulatory activities.\nAlso, the argument that the Trial Court failed to allow him to rebut such\nevidence is not supported by the record. The Commissioner's assertion that the\nCourt improperly denied his request, made during the trial, for an order allowing\nhim to conduct a physical examination of the two students for whom the\nz4 The cases on which the Commissioner relies for the reversal of a verdict based\non the Curative Admissibility Doctrine are all criminal cases from which it naturally\nfollows that acriminal defendant has a greater right and interest inbeing able toaddress\nevidence adduced by the Commonwealth.\n90\n\nSpecializeFdoodProgramhadbeenterminateidgnoresthatDMRhadalready\nconductedmultipleexaminationosf theJRCstudents.The Commissioner\nadmittedattrialthatthepsychiatricandmedicaelvaluationtshatheconducteodn\nall of theJRCstudentsin 1994echoedthefindingsof the 1991and1993\nCertificationReportwshichallstatedthattheJRCstudentwserenotinanyway\nharmedbyJRC'streatment(.Tr.

The Commissioner did have an\nopportunity to present evidence on this issue through the testimony of Richard\nCohen, Esq. head of the investigations for DMR, whom the Commissioner called\nas its witness concerning the normal process of investigating providers.\nAlthough characterized as rebuttal evidence, this testimony of Attorney Cohen\nwas actually offered as part of the Commissioner's affirmative case regarding his\nproper regulatory activity, over which the Trial Court had broad discretion in\ndetermining its admission. _ Drake v. Goodman, 386 Mass. 88, 92 (1982).\nA review of the transcript shows that the Trial Court allowed the\nCommissioner great leeway in presenting evidence through Attorney Cohen\nconcerning the Department's general investigationpractice. (Tr. XIIA, 133-142).\nThe instructions from the Trial Court to limit questions to JRC only came after\ncounsel for DMR continued to question Attorney Cohen regarding general\npractices instead of turning to an explanation of the specific application and\nrelevancy of such practices to JRC. fir. XIIA, 141-142). It was within the\nTrial Court's discretion to require the Commissioner to provide evidence linking\nthe investigations practice to JRC. See Commonwealth v. Tobin, 392 Mass.\n604, 613 (1984) (judge has broad discretion in deciding whether evidence is\nrelevant); Reily v. MBTA, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 414 (1992). The instruction\nto counsel for DMR to \"move along\" in order to end the repetitive testimony,\n(Tr. XIIA, 143), was a proper exercise of the control over the process of the trial\nand was not an abuse of discretion. S._egCommonwealth v. Guld_, 22 Mass.\nApp. Ct. 907,909 (1986). Adoption of Seth, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 343,350 (1990)\n(court is \"directing and controlling mind of the trial\"). Again, there was no\nabuse of discretion and no prejudice to the Commissioner requhing reversal of\nthe entire judgment.\n111. THE FACTUAL FINDINGS OF TitE TRIAL COURT ARE NOT\nCLEARLY ERRONEOUS\nA. The Findings Of Fact By The Trial Court Are Not A Verbatim\nAdoption Of The Findings Of JRC\nContrary to the assertion of the Commissioner, the Trial Court did not\nmerely adopt and reproduce verbatim JRC's proposed findings and conclusions.\n92\n\nAn examinationof the recordcontrastingthe proposedfindingsof JRC\n(App.634)andtheTrialCourt'sFindingsof Fact(App.1207)showsthatthe\njudgesignificantlyreworkedthe proposedfindingsof JRCto reflecther\nindependetnhtinkingandjudgmenptriortodecidingthecase.SeeCormierv.\nCa_v, 381 Mass. 234, 238 (1980), quoting from Markell v. Sidney B. Pfeifer\nFoundation, Inc,, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 412, 418 (1980). Although the Trial Court\ndid adopt many of the proposed findings in substance, the Trial Court also\nrejected many of the proposals, deleted much of the language proposed by JRC,\nand rewrote findings in drafting her own findings. See Anthony's Pier Four,\nInc. v. HBC Associates, 411 Mass. 451,465 (1991). In particular, the judge\npainstakingly drafted her own findings regarding the core issues of the case. Se._._ee\nMarkel_.__s_u/I_,9.p_.Lata,418; Edinburg v. Cavers, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 219 n. 7\n(1986).\nThe Commissioner argues that every one of the subsidiary Findings of\nFact are erroneous. (Brief, p.75). However, the Commissioner's Brief\naddresses only a small portion of the 303 findings. The Commissioner's\nassertion that all of the findings are erroneous is evidence that this is merely an\nunreasonable, baseless, and contrived argument. The record supports that there\nwas not a mere typing or signing of JRC's proposed findings by the Trial Court,\nas the Commissioner asserts. Contrast Marr v. Back Bay Architectural\nC._o_, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 681 (1987).\nIt stands to reason that the substance of many of the Trial Court's\nfindings reflect JRC's proposed findings, including findings regarding the\ncredibility of witnesses, since both counsel and the judge heard the same evidence\nat trial. The Trial Court simply determined that JRC's proposed findings\naccurately expressed the testimony, especially since every one of JRC's proposed\nfindings contained a specific reference to the trial testimony. (App. 634). The\nTrial Court was justified in relying on the substance of JRC's proposed findings\nindrafting her own findings since they \"accurately expressed\" [herl decision after\n[her] consideration of the evidence and [her] evaluation of the credibility of the\nwitnesses.\" Edinburg v. Cavers, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 219. Moreover, a review\nof the trial transcript shows that the Trial Court was \"engaged in the proceedings\n93\n\nandin command of the issues\" throughout the trial. Anthony's Pier Four, Inc.\nv. HBC Associates, 411 Mass. at 465 n.18; see _ Makino. U.S.A., In,;, v,\nMetlife Capital Credit C0rp,, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 314 (1988). The record\nin this case makes \"clear that the findings are the product of [herl independent\njudgment,\" Anthony't; Pier Four, sup__, at 465, and evidence a \"badge of\npersonal analysis\" by the Trial Judge to be afforded deference by this Court. See\nCormier v. Carry, 381 Mass. at 237, quoting from In Re Las Colinas, Inc., 426\nF.2d 1005, 1010 (lst. Cir. 1970).\nIn addition, this case differs from those where the courts have criticized\nor reversed a trial judge's findings because of verbatim adoption of a party's\nsubmittals. First, the Trial Court in this instance requested and received\nproposed findings from all parties, not just JRC. Contrast Cormier v. Carry, 381\nMass. at 235. _ Sico v. Sico, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 882, 882 (1980);\nEdinburg v. Cavers. 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 218. Again, the fact that the Trial\nCourt rejected the Commissioner's distorted review of the evidence, and instead\naccepted the substance of JRC's proposals complete with citations to the\ntestimony, was proper where the Trial Court determined that JRC's review of the\nevidence was accurate. S.ee Edinburg v. Cavers, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 218-219.\nSecond, the Trial Court issued her findings on October 6, 1995, within three\nmonths of the close of trial, which meant that the Trial Court was relying on her\nmemory of the evidence still fresh in her mind, rather than depending on the\ntestimony as recounted by the parties in their submittals. See Makino, U.S.A.,\nInc. v. Metlife Capital Credit Corp,, 25 Mass. App. Ct. at 314-315.\nFinally, the Trial Court requested proposals from the parties at the close\nof the trial and r_ to issuing the final version of her findings together with the\nIudgment and Order. The court in Cormier v. (_arty, su_, specifically ruled\nthat it did not condone the rl2Lq_f_QLm_ad.Aoption of \"[flindings and conclusions\nprepared ex o_ facto by counsel,\" since the reliance on submission of findings\nafter a decision is reached defeats the purpose of preparing findings, including\ninsuring the quality of the decision by \"requiring simultaneous articulation of the\njudge's underlying reasoning\" and assuring full and fair consideration of the\nparties' claims. 381 Mass. at 236-237. See also Markell v. Sidney B. Pfeifer\n94\n\nFoundation. Inc,, 9 Mass. App. CI. at 416, quoting from Robert v. Ros_;, 344\nF.2d 747, 751-752 (3rd Cir. 1965); Ramey Construction CO., Inc. v. Apache\nTribe of the Mescalaro, 616 F.2d 464, 466-467 (10th Cir. 1980). In contrast,\nthe court in C0rmier v. Catty, :su_p_, expressly approved, as occurred here, the\npre-decision submission of proposed findings, in recognition of the practical\nnecessity of a trial judge facing an ever-expanding docket:\nNothing we say in this opinion should be construed as criticism\nof the practice of soliciting proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law from all parties at the close of evidence\nbefore a decision has been reached. Nor are we unaware of the\nconcern for 'efficient administration [of justice] that leads hard-\npressed judges to turn to counsel for help.'\n381 Mass. at 237 n.5, quoting from In Re Las Colinas, Inc., 426 F.2d at 1008;\nalso Markell v.

The circumstances of this case, together with the fact that the Trial\nCourt was engaged in the issues throughout the trial and drafted her own\ndistinctive findings, evidences that the Trial Court exercised independent thought\nand analysis in deciding this case, and did not merely adopt JRC's findings.\nB. The Commissioner Can Not Satisfy The Rigorous Clearly\nErroneous Standard\nEven if the Trial Court had adopted verbatim JRC's proposed Findings\nof Fact, it is well-settled that copying from a set of proposed findings is not\n\"tantamount to reversible error.\" See Makino, U.S.A., Inc. v. Metfife Capital\nCredit Com., 25 Mass. App. Ct, at 314. As this Court has stated, \"Even if a\njudge adopts verbatim findings prepared by prevailing counsel, 'It]hose findings,\nthough not the product of the workings of the judge's mind, are formally his;\nthey are not to be rejected out-of-hand, and they will stand if supported by the\nevidence.'\" First Pennsylvania Mortgage Trust v. Dorchester Savings Bank, 395\nMass. 614, 622 (1985), quoting from United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co.,\n376 U.S. 651,656 (1964); see also, Commonwealth v. DeMinico, 408 Mass.\n95\n\n230,238(1990).\"IT]headoptionof proposed findings, even verbatim, does not\nvoid the findings nor automatically displace the 'clearly erroneous' standard.\"\nCommonwealth v.

Sidney B, Pfgifer Foundation, In_:., 9 Mass.\nApp. Ct. at 417. In fact, in Cormier v, Cart_q,Xsu,ora, even though the partes\nstipulated that the trialjudge had adopted verbatim the prevailing party's ex\nfact_._souobmissions in direct contravention of the purpose of Rule 52, this Court\naffirmed the trial judge's findings because they were supported by the record.\n381 Mass. at 238; se_gals__2Eodinburg v. Cavers, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 218 n. 6.\nThus, even where the trial judge has adopted verbatim a party's findings\nof fact, which did not occur in the instant case, the appellate court \"carefully\nscrutinizes the record, but does not change the standard of review.\"\nHawkesworth, su__, at 669 n.5, _ United States v.

Metlife Capital Credit Corp. 25 Mass. App. Ct. at 314.\n96\n\nThis Court has enunciated the \"clearly erroneous\" standard of review of\nthe factual findings of a trial court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 52(a) as the\nfollowing:\nIn applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a\n[judge] sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly\nhave in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues de\nnovo. The authority of an appellate court, when reviewing the\nfindings of a judge as well as those of a jury, is circumscribed\nby the deference it must give to decisions of the trier of fact,\nwho is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the\nevidence. The question of the appellate court under Rule 52(a)\nis not whether it would have made the findings the Trial Court\ndid, but whether \"on the entire evidence [it] is left with the\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\nFirst Pennsylvania Mortgage Trust v. Dorchester Savings Bank, 395 Mass. at\n621, quoting from Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltime Research, Inc., 395 U.S.\n100, 123 (1969). \"What this means is that the judge's findings 'come here well\narmed with the buckler and the shield.'\" First Pennsylvania Mortgage Trust,\nsup.r._, at 621. (citations omitted).\nUnder the rigorous clear error test, \"lilt is not enough that an [appellate\ncourtl might give the facts another construction or resolve ambiguities differently\nand find a more sinister cast to actions which the district court deemed innocent.\"\nUnited States v. Natl,.Association of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 495\n(1950). In reviewing factual findings of a trial judge, an appellate court will not\npermit \"appellate review of complex fact-dominated issues.., to descend to the\nlevel of Monday-morning quarterbacking.\" Anderson v. Beatrice Foods, Co,,\n900 F.2d 388, 392 (lst Cir. 1990).

However, the Trial Court had the opportunity to hear all of the evidence\nand, in exercising its role as fact-finder under Rule 52(a), rejected the\nCommissioner's one-sided version of the relevant facts. \"If the trial judge makes\none of several possible choices of what facts are supported by the evidence, the\njudge's choice is not clearly erroneous.\" _.

Likewise, contrary to the Commissioner's argument,\nthe court in _larkell v. Sidney B. Pfeifer Foundation. Inc., u_, ruled that a\nless deferential standard of review was not appropriate in reviewing findings\nbased on documentary evidence in that case, because the documentary evidence\nwas interpreted through live trial testimony which provided a backdrop for\nunderstanding the documents and necessarily involved issues of credibility.\n9 Mass. App. Ct. at 429-430. Such is the situation in the present case, where\nthe testimony of the numerous witnesses at trial provided a context for\nunderstanding the documents in light of the history and actions taken by the\nparties throughout the litigation. The Commissioner argues that the Trial Court's\nfindings are clearly erroneous because certain exhibits purportedly demonstrate\nthat the Commissioner acted well within his broad statutory and regulatory\nauthority in making certification decisions regarding JRC as documented in the\ncertification letters, z_ What the Commissioner does not state, however, is that\nthe Trial Court was warranted, based upon the entire testimony, in finding that\nz_ The Commissioner's additional argument that thz entire contents of the\ncertification letters must bedeemed astrue bythe factfinder byvirtue of the letters being\noffered into evidence is wholly without merit and warrants no further discussion.\n98\n\nthestatementinsthesedocumentwserefalseormadeinrecklessdisregarfdor\nthetruth.\nC.

The\nCommissioner distorts the record before the Trial Court, and the Trial Court's\nfindings are consistently misstated and are frequently sensationalized by the\nCommissioner. The Trial Court is accused of making \"inferences\" or\n\"suggestions\" which do not appear in its decision, but which are attacked as\nclearly erroneous. Evidence is described by the Commissioner in a completely\ninaccurate fashion and evidence which is material to the particular argument\nmade by the Commissioner is omitted. Since many of the factual assertions of\nthe Commissioner are not even supported in the record and are contrary to the\nevidence at trial, this Court should not give any consideration whatsoever to these\nfactual inaccuracies and should strike them from the Commissioner's Brief.

(Tr. III, 15,18). The Commissioner was forced to concede that\nthe position he took in August of 1993 was totally inconsistent with the\n_o Itis noteworthy, however, that in his Answer and his Motion to Dismiss the\nThird Amended Contempt Complaint, the Commissioner asserted that he was \"not a\nproper party\" to the contempt complaint.

The Commissioner acted in bad faith by rejecting the\nrecommendations of the 1991 And 1993 Certification\nTeams and secretin_ their laudatory findinzs\nThe Commissioner attacks findings of the Trial Court concerning the\nCommissioner's reason for rejecting the recommendations of the staff review\n101\n\nteam. (Brief, p.80). The Commissioner cites Finding 49 and Finding 52 as the\nbasis for his assertion that the Trial Court erred in finding that the\nCommissioner's rejection of the 1993 Certification Report was made in bad\nfaith? _ However, these two findings do not relate to the 1993 Report, as the\nTrial Court only stated in these two cited findings that the failure of the\nCommissioner to include members of the 1993 Certification Team in subsequent\nJRC discussions was \"strong evidence of the bad faith purpose\" of the Weekly\nMeetings. The Trial Court made extensive other findings concerning the bad\nfaith nature of the Weekly Meetings, many of which are not challenged by the\nCommissioner. The Commissioner mischaracterizes these two findings.\nRegardless of the mischaracterization, the Trial Court was fully\nwarranted in finding that the Commissioner's basis for rejecting the 1991 and\n1993 Certification Reports was done inbad faith and that the reasons asserted for\nrejecting them were pretextual. The Commissioner attacks the findings of the\nTrial Court (F. 42; F. 45) that DMR dispatched the 1993 Certification Team to\nJRC \"unnecessarily and under false pretenses.\" Those two findings likewise\ncontain no such language. In Finding 42, the Trial Court found that Deputy\nCounsel Casey and Dr. Riley had reviewed the Specialized Food and GED\nprogram during their visit to JRC in December of 1991. The 1991 Certification\nReport:. itself states that the Team reviewed the GED device and recommended\ncertification. (U-37, 3). Likewise, Amanda Chalmers' letter of July 21, 1992,\nclaiming that another review would be required to evaluate the _new\" Specialized\nFood and GED Program was inconsistent with her earlier letter that she had\naccepted the 1991 Certification Report which had reviewed these programs. (-tJ-\n43; U-46). DMR's own documents support Finding 45 that, contrary to the\nassertion of Ms. Chalmers, the Specialized Food Program and the GED Program\nwere known to DMR at the time of the initial visit by the 1991 Certification\nTeam. (U-37; U-35). The Trial Court also correctly found that Commissioner\n_ In this section dealing with the clearly erroneous argument, references to the\nFindings of Fact of the Trial Court are cited as \"F. \" or \"Finding, \" referencing\nthe specific paragraph number. The Findings of Fact collectively are located in the\nrecord at App. 1207-1293.\n102\n\nCampbealldmittedthathehadbeeninformedofthesetwoprogramsfromhis\nDirectorofHumanRights.(U-35;Tr. 1114,6). The Commissioner's argument\nthat these two findings are clearly erroneous is frivolous.\nThe Commissioner next argues that the Trial Court erred in finding that\nthe review team conducted a \"thorough\" investigation of the GED and\nSpecialized Food Programs. Again, the Commissioner inaccurately cites the\nfindings of the Trial Court. The Trial Court did not conclude that the review\nteam, in the Trial Court's opinion, conducted a \"thorough investigation\" of these\nprograms. Rather, the Trial Court, in Finding ,iS, merely noted that the report\nof the 1993 Certification Team itself stated that it had undertaken a \"thorough\"\ninvestigation. (U-75).\nFurthermore, the Trial Court's findings regarding the completeness of the\n1993 Certification Report are supported by the record. (Brief, p.81). In\nFinding 51, the Trial Court concluded that the 1993 Certification Report was\ncomplete. Contrary to the statement of the Commissioner, Deputy Counsel\nCasey, testified that he considered the 1993 Certification Report to be\n\"complete,\" and, therefore, forwarded to General Counsel Murdock at the central\noffice of DMR. (Tr. 1, 128-129,137). Thereafter, no one at DMR ever spoke\nto him about the 1993 Certification Report and, to his knowledge, no one spoke\nwith any members of the 1993 Certification Team concerning the 1993\nCertification Report. (Tr. I, 140). No one ever told him the 1993 Certification\nReport was incomplete. (Tr. I, 136). The fact that Dr. Riley was not able to\nreview the information on the misfires alone does not affect the validity of\nDeputy Counsel Casey's position of when the 1993 Certification Report was\ncomplete. The purpose of the 1993 visit was \"strictly focused on health and\nsafety issues\" raised by the GED-4 and Specialized Food Program, and Dr.\nRiley's role was limited as a clinical psychologist. (U-75, 10). Indeed, Deputy\nCounsel Casey testified that he was unclear why Dr. Riley was on the second\nteam to start since he was not involved in any health or safety issues. (Tr. I,\n121).\nThe Commissioner argues that the Trial Court erred in finding that the\nCommissioner's only justification for considering the 1993 Certification Report\n103\n\ntobeincomplete was the fact that it was not signed by Dr. Riley. (Brief, p.82).\nThe Commissioner argues that he received \"advice\" from the General Counsel\nin describing the 1993 Certification Report and its deficiencies. Yet, at trial, the\nCommissioner was compelled to acknowledge his deposition testimony where he\nstated that his General Counsel told him only that the report was \"incomplete.\"\n(Tr. 111,76-77). The fact that the Commissioner acknowledged the work of these\ntwo teams, both in his August 6 Letter and his Report to the Court, further\ndemonstrates that the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports were not \"rejected\"\nby the Commissioner because of lack of completeness or any other reason.\nFinally, the Commissioner attacks the finding of the Trial Court (F. 52) that the\n1991 and 1993 Certification Reports were never read until 1995 by the\nCommissioner, Dr. Cerreto, or any of the key individuals who were making\ndecisions on JRC's certification. (Brief, p.82). However, both the\nCommissioner and Dr. Cerreto testified that they did not read the 1991 and 1993\nCertification Reports until 1995. (Tr. 11I70-72; Tr. X, 166; Tr. X 145-146).\nThe Trial Court was fully justified in discounting the pretextual reasons from the\nCommissioner as to why he \"rejected\" the recommendations of the 1991 and\n1993 Certifications Teams.\n3. The Commissioner and his Deputy Counsel admitted to\nfalse statements in the Commissioner's August 6, 1993\nCertification Letter\nThe Commissioner argues in this Brief at page 84 that the Trial Court\nignored the evidence which demonstrated, according to the Commissioner, that\nhe had a good faith basis for the statements contained in his August 6 Letter.\nAgain, the record supports that there was no good faith basis for this letter, as\nprincipally supported by testimony from the Commissioner and his own Deputy\nGeneral Counsel.\nThe Commissioner first attacks (Brief, p.86) Finding 70 of the Trial\nCourt that the Commissioner misrepresented the findings of 1993 Certification\nTeam. On page three of his August 6 Letter, Commissioner Campbell stated that\nthe 1993 Certification Team \"felt unable to reach a conclusion on whether the\nissue of GED misfires presented a problem for [JRC's] ability to comply with\n104\n\n§ 20.15.\" TheTrial Court concluded that this assertion was false. (F. 70). The\nCommissioner testified that this statement was based upon his belief that the 1993\nCertification Team had met and discussed the issue of GED misfires, fir. 111,\n93). However, Deputy Counsel Casey testified that the 1993 Certification Team\nnever discussed GED misfires, so it obviously reached no such conclusion.\nfir. 1, 152). Indeed, the only material finding relative to the issue of misfires\nwas the cardiologist, Dr. Lauridsen's, conclusion that the misfirings were\ninfrequent and did not present a danger to the health and safety of the JRC\nstudents. (13-75,6). Moreover, the 1993 Certification Team never stated that\nthere was a \"problem\" concerning JRC's ability to comply with § 20.15, insofar\nas the Team recommended that JRC be certified. (1.1-75, 11)) 2\nThe Commissioner next argues at page 87 that the Trial Court\n\"criticized _ the Commissioner for asking JRC to provide a list of aversive\nprocedures. (F. 73). In the August 6 Letter, JRC was required to provide\nDMR, within twenty-one days, a \"list of aversive techniques and an existing\ndescription of how such techniques are used at JRC.\" (U-82, 5). As the Trial\nCourt noted, Deputy Counsel Casey testified that JRC provided the Certification\nTeam with this information and was reviewed by the Team. flr. 1, 160).\nIn Finding 67, the Trial Court found that the Commissioner's August 6\nLetter conflicted with evidentiary hearings inthe Probate Court which established\nthat the procedures utilized at IRC were effective. This testimony was supported\nby the evidence. (JRC-240). The August 6 Letter also falsely implied that\n_2 DMR quotes selectively from the testimony of Attorney Casey on this issue.\n(Brief, p.86). However, Attorney Case)' never stated that the Commissioner's\ncharacterizationof theTeam's €onclusion was correct. Indeed, Attorney Casey testified\nas follows:\nQ_ Youwould agree with me, would you not, then that theissueof clinical\n-- of the misfires didn't affect your opinion that BRI should be given\nrecertifieation, did itsir?\nA'. Not as tong as they gave information about it, no.\nQ: And you have no reason to think that they wouldn't give the\ninformation, Is that correct sir?.\nA: No, that's correct.\n(Tr. 1, 155).\n105\n\nevidencceoncerninpgrofessionaalcceptabilithyadbeenrequestefdromJRCbut\nhadnotbeenforthcoming.TheCommissionewrasunabletoidentifyanyfacts\ntosuggesthtatJRChadbeenaskedandrefusedtoprovideevidencethatthe\nGED-4andthe SpecializedFoodProgramwereprofessionallaycceptable.\n(Tr.!11,107).Likewise,DeputyCounseClhow-Menzemr adenorequesftor\ninformationconcerningthe effectivenesosf the procedureor professional\nacceptabilitoyfSpecializeFdoodina1992letterrequestinignformationonthis\nprogram,fir.

The Trial Court's findings were fully warranted.\nThe Commissioner then argues that the Trial Court faulted the\nCommissioner for \"contradicting those Probate Court findings\" and for\n\"deliberately ignoring the opinions of psychologists hired by the Department to\nreport to the Probate Court on an individual's substituted judgment proceedings.\"\n(Brief, p.87). Again, the Commissioner deliberately mischaracterizes the\nfindings of the Trial Court. The Trial Court did not _fault the Commissioner for\ncontradicting Probate Court findings.\" What the Trial Court stated was that\nProbate Court findings had established that the procedures were effective and\nthere was therefore evidence which was available for the Commissioner to\nexamine, which was true. (JRC-239; JRC-240).\nLikewise, the Trial Court's finding (F. 69) that the Commissioner's\ntestimony was in \"deliberate ignorance\" of clinical information \"prepared by\npsychologists retained by him, and contained in his office files\" was fully\njustified by the record. For example, on April 29, 1993, less than four months\nbefore the Commissioner's letter, the Commissioner's legal department received\na report from DMR psychologist, Dr. Frederic Krell, expressing the opinion that\nthe GED was _more effective than any other intervention which was applied over\nthe previous seventeen years\" for this client. (JRC-244, 10). The Commissioner\nacknowledged that this was the type of information which was relevant to the\n106\n\nissueof effectiveness, (Tr. III, 111), but it was not considered even though it\nwas in DMR's own files.\nIn short, the Trial Court was more than justified in concluding in\nFinding 64 that the August 6 Letter was the \"first volley\" in a series of actions\ndesigned to put JRC out of business.\n4. The Commissioner was attire, in response to the\nanlicioated CBS broadcast\nThe Commissioner contends that the Trial Court erroneously concluded\nthat the Commissioner's position concerning both the Settlement Agreement and\nthe JRC program were improperly motivated by his concern as to how his agency\nmight be depicted in an upcoming television program on JRC, and that the\nCommissioner testified falsely on this subject. (Brief, p.88). The Commissioner\nasserts that these findings are not only \"without any basis in the evidence\" but\nalso \"grossly mischaracterized the little evidence presented on this subject.\"\n(Brief, p.89). It is the Commissioner who mischaracterizes the Trial Court's\nfinding. The Trial Court concluded that the Commissioner's concern as to how\nhe might be depicted in the upcoming CBS television program was \"at least part\nof the reason\" why he abruptly changed his position concerning both the\nSettlement Agreement and the JRC program. In any event, the Trial Court's\nfindings (F. 61; F. 62) were not clearly erroneous. The Commissioner admitted\nat trial that both be and his superiors in the administration were concerned that\nDMR might be depicted as not properly monitoring JRC in the upcoming CBS\nbroadcast, fir. ill, 52-53,58).\nThe Commissioner blatantly misrepresents the record when he asserts that\nthe Trial Court erred in finding (F. 61) that \"Commissioner Campbell testified\nthat he never did anything in anticipation of the upcoming CBS television\nprogram.\" On page 89 of his Brief, the Commissioner states that the Trial\nCourt's \"adverse findings on this subject all rest on the erroneous premise that\nthe Commissioner testified that he 'never did anything' in anticipation of the\ntelevision program,\" but that he \"never denied doing anything in anticipation of\nthat show.\" (Brief, p.89). During his testimony, the Commissioner testified that\n107\n\nhe \"was not motivated by {the Connie Chung Show about JRC].\" fir. Ill, 58-\n59). In stark contrast, the Commissioner's own workplan agendas, which are not\ndiscussed in his Brief on this issue, revealed that he had proposed mailing letters\nto parents which were strategically planned \"in anticipation\" of the \"Chung\"\nprogram. (U-208). Likewise, the Trial Court drew a reasonable inference in\nconcluding that concerns about how the administration would be depicted on a\nnational television program was at least part of the reason for the\nCommissioner's abrupt and radical change in position on his obligations under\nthe Settlement Agreement, since the uncontroverted evidence showed that the\nCommissioner's position on the Settlement Agreement changed dramatically from\nyears past at about the same time that the Commissioner learned of the CBS\nprogram. Given this testimony, the Trial Court was warranted in linking the\nCommissioner's actions to the upcoming television program.\n5. The Commissioner did not have a good faith basis\nwhen he investigated the Court Monitor and the\nGuardian Ad Litem\nThe Commissioner contends that the Trial Court mischaracterizes DMR's\n_good faith attempts\" to learn the nature and extent of Dr. Daignault's\nrelationship with JRC's attorneys and its clients. (Brief, p.90). The fact that the\nCommissioner believes the Trial Court's decision \"mischaracterizes his good faith\nattempts\" isnot a basis for concluding that the Trial Court findings were clearly\nerrofleous.\nIn any event, the Trial Court made no mischaraterizations. On\nAugust 19, 1993, in response to JRC's first request for arbitration with the Court\nMonitor, the Commissioner's privately-retained counsel, David Ferleger, wrote\na letter to the Court Monitor requesting information regarding Dr. Daignault's\nfinancial and/or consulting relationship between him and JRC's law firm, and\nrequested copies of the bills submitted to the Trial Court for his services as Court\nMonitor. (JRC-BS; Tr. Ill, 156). The attack was based upon an alleged conflict\nof interest involving Dr. Daignault. Commissioner Campbell Nguessed\" that is\nwas just coincidental that he raise he raised the conflict of issue at the same time\nJRC first requested arbitration. (Tr. Ill, 157). This attack upon Dr. Daignault\n108\n\nculminatedin accusations in a \"conflict of interest\" letter to Dr. Daignault\nbecause he had performed consultations on clients at the Eckert Seamans law\nfirm, the law firm which represents JRC. fir. I11, 156). At the time these\nattacks were made, however, Dr. Daignault had been retained not only by\ncounsel for JRC, but by counsel for the wards to consult on various matters, as\nwell as various agencies of the Commonwealth including DMR. (Tr. II, 158-\n159). The Commissioner conceded that Dr. Daignault had been utilized as a\nconsultant by his own Department as recently as June, 1993. fir. II, 158-159;\nTr. IX, 50-51). The attack upon Dr. Daignault's \"ethics\" was particularly\nremarkable, since the Commissioner testified both in his deposition and at trial\nthat he did not believe that Dr. Daignault had any bias against DMR. (Tr. 111,\n158). The allegation of a conflict was merely a pretext to remove a court official\nwhom the Commissioner perceived as a potential obstacle to his plans.\nEven though DMR lawyers felt Dr. Daignault had a conflict of interest\nin August of 1993, they did not hesitate to utilize Dr. Daignault to suit their own\npurposes. On October 14, 1993, General Counsel Murdock sent a letter to\nDr. Daignault requesting the Court Monitor's \"approval of the independent\nprogram review required as a condition of JRC's interim certification.\" fl'he\nindependent program review related tothe Rivendell matter described infra). (U-\n110). General Counsel Murdock's letter of October 14, 1993, came less than\none month after she and the Commissioner had rejected the further attempts of\narbitration by the Court Monitor concerning the mailing of the August 6 and\nAugust31 Letters. Accordingly, Dr. Daignault advised General Counsel\nMurdock that mediation could not be reinstituted unless DMR revised itsposition\nand made an unequivocal commitment to the process of mediation in compliance\nwith the Settlement Agreement. (JRC-251). On that same day, DMR noticed\nDr. Daignault's deposition. (U-I 11). On October 19, 1993, DMR sent a letter\nto Dr. Daignault, requesting that he \"reconsider\" his role as Court Monitor for\n\"at least as a matter of conscience.\" (U-113).\n. The Cornmls$ioner gave false testimony about his\n1991 telephone conversation with Henry Clark, Esquire\n109\n\nTheCommissionceorntendastpage 93 of his Brief that the Trial Court\nerred in accepting the testimony of Henry Clark, Esq. (\"Mr. Clark \") over the\ntestimony of the Commissioner. The Trial Court found that the issue pertaining\nto Mr. Clark's conversation arose in response to questioning by Attorney\nYogman who made an eftbrt to justify the \"enormous legal resources devoted to\nthe JRC certification process\" by DMR. (F. 92). The Commissioner testified\nthat Mr. Clark had contacted the Commissioner once he assumed office to\n_warn _ him not to do anything to JRC. (F. 93). Mr. Clark's version of the\nevents was much different, and he testified that he called Commissioner\nCampbell as a former colleague to congratulate him on his appointment.\nMr. Clark testified that the Commissioner stated that because Mr. Clark was an\nattorney, and because Mr. Campbell was going to be the Commissioner, \"we\ncan't talk to each other anymore.\" (Tr. VIII, 156-158). The Trial Court had the\nopportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and chose to believe\nAttorney Clark. Furthermore, the Trial Court was entitled to consider the\nnumerous other inconsistencies in the Commissioner's testimony, many of which\nwere admitted by the Commissioner, in assessing his testimony as not credible.\nThe Commissioner's attacks on the Trial Court's findings regarding the\ncredibility of witnesses ignores the proper standard under rule 52.\n7. The Commissioner's August 31, 1993 Cerfification\nLetter was als0 rife with false and defamatory statemen_\nabout .IRC and another product of the Commissioner's\nThe Commissioner asserts that he had a good faith basis for sending the\nAugust 31 Letter. The Commissioner first mischaracterizes Finding 98.\nContrary to the statement of the Commissioner at page 94 of his brief, the Trial\nCourt neither suggested that the August 31 Letter was unnecessary, nor found\nthat the August 27 materials successfully rebutted the factual allegations in the\nCommissioner's August 6 Letter. The Trial Court only found that JRC had\nserved a rebuttal to the August 6 Letter and did not, as suggested by the\nCommissioner, determine the merits of the rebuttal in Finding 98.\n110\n\nThe Commissioner next argues (Brief, p.96) that the Trial Court\nimproperly concluded as being false the assertion in the August 31 Letter that the\nsource of the information concerning GED misfires was some one other than\nJRC. (F. 102). The August 31 Letter states that the source of information on\nGED misfires was not JRC. (U-91,1). The Commissioner's statement that the\nissue of misfires had been brought to the attention of DMR from a source \"other\nthan BRI,\" was categorically false. Deputy Counsel Casey testified that he\nremembered reviewing information provided by JRC on the issue of misfires,\n(Tr. I, 133), as well as discussing misfires with staff and JRC doctors. (Tr. I,\n154,166). Deputy Counsel Casey conceded that the Commissioner's statement\nin the August 31 Letter about the source of misfire was inaccurate, (Tr. I, 167),\nreiterating that as \"far as i'm concerned, 1knew about it, and 1 knew about it\nfrom BRI.\" (Tr. I, 176). The Trial Court's Finding 102 said nothing about the\nCommissioner's \"good faith\" basis for making this statement (although it is clear\nthat the Commissioner had none) and simply stated that his statement in the letter\nwas not true. The Trial Court's finding merely tracked the testimony of the\nCommissioner's own lawyer.\nThe Commissioner attacks Finding 109, (Brief, p.98), asserting that the\nTrial Court erred when it stated that Condition 1 restricted JRC to the use of\nprocedures which were actually in use as of August 27, 1993. The\nCommissioner's assertion isfalse. The August 31 Letter was a so-called \"interim\ncertification\" letter. Under the Commissioner's view, certification was a\nprerequisite to JRC utilizing aversive procedures. The first sentence of\nCondition 1, omitted in the brief, states that, \"effective immediately, BRI's\ninterim certification extends only to the use of the aversive techniques under\nLevel 111listed in Exhibit 7-2 to your August 27, 1993 letter to me.\"\n03-91,3). This sentence could not be clearer. JRC was only certified to use\nthose Level I11 procedures presently in use. The language quoted in the\nCommissioner's Brief merely sets forth a process that would be followed in the\nevent that JRC wanted to utilize aversive procedures that it was not utilizing.\n111\n\nTheCommissionmeirsrepresents the facts to this Court when he argues thatthere\nwas no restriction on aversive procedures in his August 31 Letter? 3\nThe Commissioner next challenges the findings of the Trial Court relative\nto the issueofrestraint. (F. 107). The Commissioner argues that the August 31\nLetter set forth \"in full detail\" the factual basis for DMR's conclusion that JRC\nhad consistently and repeatedly violated DMR's mechanical restraint regulation.\n(Brief, p.99). The Trial Court's decision stated that there was no evidence\nadduced that JRC had utilized mechanical restraint without a substituted judgment\norder or in circumstances other than those recognized as appropriate as set forth\nin a memorandum by DMR's General Counsel. (F. 106; F. 107). The Trial\nCourt was fully justified in making this finding. Contrary to the statement in the\nCommissioner's Brief, Dr. Israel never admitted that JRC violated DMR's\nrestraint regulations. The Commissioner testified in his deposition and at trial\nthat JRC was cited for not complying with the restraint regulations because there\nwere situations when JRC was using mechanical restraint and JRC had not\nreceived substituted iudgment orders, fir. I11, 147). In a memorandum\nprepared by General Counsel Murdock concerning the behavior modification\nregulations, DMR acknowledged that in emergency situations, Level I11 Plans\n(which the Commissioner acknowledged can include restraint) can be\nimplemented without the necessary court approval. (U-15). There was no\nevidence to show that JRC violated DMR's restraint policy, and the Trial Court's\nfinding was correct.\nThe Commissioner also attacks (Brief, p. 100) the Trial Court's findings\nconcerning Condition 10 in the August 31 Letter, which provided that JRC had\nto notify its Funding and Placement Agencies within sixty days of an \"_\n33 The Commissioner was aware onAugust 3I, 1993that JRC was authorir.e..dto\nutilize procedures which itmight not be using on any particular day. (Tr. 11I,142). The\nConmfissioner decided to issue his directive of August 31, even though Trial Court\norders pemdtted JRC toutilize procedures other than those that were specifically in use\non August 27, 1993. Instead of .seeking tomodify outstanding Court orders in the case\nto avoid a conflict between Executive Department action and judicial orders, the\nCommissioner departed from the Settlement Agreement and his established course of\naction, (U-15,¶14), and simply administratively overruled outstanding ordersof the Thai\nCourt.\n112\n\nplan\" for each resident to address the funding and logistics of any unexpected\nmedical, personal or programmatic situation which JRC deems are beyond the\ncapacity of JRC to address. (Emphasis supplied). The Trial Court was\nwarranted in finding (F. I11) that this condition was purposefully designed to\nalarm JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies and obstruct JRC's intake of new\nstudents.\nThe Commissioner testified that Condition 10 was based upon \"prior\nsituations _ where JRC had unexpectedly discharged students who then became\nthe responsibility of DMR. But, when pressed by JRC counsel, the\nCommissioner could only identify one situation involving a discharge which\nallegedly occurred in or about 1991, and could offer no explanation as to why\nthis Condition was being imposed in 1993 as a result of an event which\nsupposedlyoccurred in 1991. (Tr. I11, 151,157). Moreover, the Commissioner\nalso acknowledged that no conditions similar to this had ever been imposed in the\ncase of other programs which had unexpectedly terminated clients. (Tr. 111,\n154).\nThe Trial Court's finding concerning the impact of Condition 10 was\nreasonable. At the tin,e the August 31 Letter was sent out by the Commissioner,\n(Tr. II, 157-158), JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies had already received\nfrom DMR allegations of a host of alleged JRC misdeeds, including allegations\nthat JRC was consistently violating DMR regulations. The Trial Court was fully\njustified in concluding that under these circumstances, a Funding or Placement\nAgency would not seek new placements when emergency plans were being\ndeveloped to remove existing clients from a program allegedly in violation of\nstate regulations. 34\nThe Commissioner asserts that the Trial Court also incorrectly concluded\n(F. 112) that Condition 10 was \"part of a plan to place JRC into receivership or\nto close JRC down.\" (Brief, pp.101-102). The Trial Court's finding was\n34 In addition, the Trial Court hadthe benefit of the testimony of Dr. Daignault,\nwho stated that when be was apprised of thiscondition, he was also concerned because,\nbased upon his contact with funding sources, he felt that the condition would cause great\nalarm. (Tr. II, 141).\n113\n\nsupportedbytheevidence.TheAttorneyGeneral'sofficehadbeeninstructed\nto prepare a receivership petition, and the Weekly Meeting Group was actually\ndiscussing what had to occur before \"BRI closes.\" 0RC-293, 5). At a time\nwhen the Commissioner was informing JRC parents and Court officials that he\nhad no Ip_ to close down JRC, (11-92; App. 147), it is apparent that he did\nhave such plans. Based upon the fact that JRC was required to draw up\n\"emergency plans\" in the event of \"unexpected medical, personal or\nprogrammatic situations,\" the Trial Court was fully justified in concluding that\nCondition 10was part of the Commissioner's plan to place JRC into receivership\nor to close JRC down.\n8. The Commissioner's false and defamatory s_atement_ tO\nthe JRC Parents and JRC's Funding and Placement\nAgencies were established at trial\nThe Commissioner argues that the Trial Court \"mischaracterizes the\nevidence\" in Finding 116. (Brief, p.105). It is not clear from the\nCommissioner's Brief which specific part of Finding 116 he is challenging. The\nTrial Court correctly found that the Commissioner mailed copies of his August 6\nand August 31 Letters to all of JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies on\nSeptember 24, 1993 and, further, that the mailing included the original version\nof the August 31 Letter, as well as Condition 10, \"the very requirement\nconcerning emergency placements which JRC wished to avoid.\" (JRC-105;\nTr. 111, 167). The Trial Court also correctly concluded that the Commissioner\nrejected the request for arbitration with the Court Monitor. (U-34; Tr. 111,166).\nThe Commissioner argues that in fact he did attempt to mediate this\ndispute by telephone and facsimile on September 23, 1993. (Brief, p. 106). JRC\nrequested arbitration with the Court Monitor before DMR mailed out the letters\nto JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies. (JRC-249). In response to JRC's\nrequest for arbitration, Dr. Daignault and GAL Briggs wrote to General Counsel\nMurdock \"imploring\" her to agree to arbitration under the Settlement Agreement\nprior to the letters being sent. (JRC-250). Despite both requests, the\nCommissioner elected to proceed unilaterally, rejecting the request of the Court\nMonitor for even a meeting. (U-54; Tr. 111, 166-167). Dr. Daignault thereupon\n114\n\nreportedto theTrial Court that arbitration under Paragraph B-2 had failed.\n(JRC-250). The assertion of the Commissioner that there had been a form of\nmediation is patently frivolous.\nLikewise, the evidence supported the Commissioner's intention to send\nonly negative information regarding JRC. The Commissioner testified that he\ncould not offer an explanation as to why JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies\nhad not been advised that Condition 10 had been modified, fir. 111, 171), or\nincluded the unsubstantiated allegations of Dr. Jansen, castigating the JRC\nprogram, (U-105; Tr. Ill, 173), or made absolutely no mention of the favorable\n1991 and 1993 Certification Reports. He never adequately corrected the false\nallegation about \"deaths\" not being reported at JRC, and the false allegation that\nDr. Israel had personally engaged in a serious abuse of JRC clients. (Tr. III,\n192-193; JRC-266). The Court's findings that the mailing of September 24,\n1993 was part of a pattern to spread false allegations about the JRC program and\nDr. Israel was warranted.\n9. The Commissioner's Reoort to the Court was a fraud\n\"l'heCommissioner argues that the Trial Court's findings (F. 120-124) on\nthe unsolicited \"Report to the Court\" concerning the \"Status of Behavior\nResearch Institute\" were erroneous. The Commissioner falsely characterizes the\n\"basis\" of the Trial Court's decision as resting upon the failure of the Report to\nthe Court to describe or include as exhibits the two \"internal reports of DMR\nfield staff.\" (Brief, p. 109). These \"internal reports\" were actually the 1991 and\n1993 Certification Reports which recommended certification. Although there was\nreference to these Reports, they were never submitted for the Trial Court to\nreview at any time prior to trial. In his Brief, the Commissioner states that the\n1991 and 1993 Certification Reports were \"immaterial\" since they had been\nrejected by the Commissioner and were not the official position of DMR. (Brief,\np.109). But, given that the Commissioner described (albeit falsely) the\nconclusions and recommendations of the 1991 and 1993 Certification Teams, it\nis apparent that he did not view them as irrelevant and immaterial, and it was\nincumbent for him to have included these official agency documents with the\n115\n\nReport to the Court. (App. 180-182). Moreover, the fact that the Commissioner\nfailed to include the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports in the Report to the\nCourt was not the sole basis for the findings of fraud onthe Court. The Trial\nCourt also found that the Report to the Court contained false statements, (F.\n124), as the Commissioner's own lawyer testified, fir. I1, 13-15; Tr. !, 175-\n176).\n10. The Commissioner acted in bad faith by appointing\nDr. Gunner Dybwad to JRC's Human Rights Committee\nand further violated the Settlemen.l Agreement by\nrefusing to arbitrate the issue\nThe Commissioner asserts the Trial Court erred in finding (F. 128) that\nthe appointment of Dr. Gunnar Dybwad was \"calculated . . . to disrupt the\noperations of IBRI].\" (Brief, p.l 11). The Commissioner also attacks as clearly\nerroneous the fact that DMR declined to mediate the issue of Dr. Dybwad's\nappointment to the Human Rights Committee.\nFirst, the Trial Court reasonably concluded that Dr. Dybwad was\nappointed to disrupt JRC, The Commissioner testified at trial that Dr. Dybwad\ndid not support the us,_,of aversive procedures, and stated in his deposition that\nhe was unable to identify any aversive procedures that Dr. Dybwad supported.\n(Tr. III, 130, 131). Dr. Israel also testified that Dr. Dybwad was a well-known\nopponent of aversive therapy, fir. VIIA, 65). In addition, the Trial Court\nreceived into evidence a letter which JRC's counsel had sent to the Commissioner\ndocumenting Dr. Dybwad's longstanding hostility toward JRC. 0RC-275).\nSecond, the Trial Court correctly determined that DMR declined to\narbitrate the subject of Dr. Dybwad's appointment to the Human Rights\nCommittee, On October 8, 1993, JRC requested arbitration under Paragraph\nB-2, (JRC-275), but was rejected by General Counsel Murdock who noted that,\n\"The Department has consistently maintained that it does not agree that the\nSettlement Agreement requires it to submit to mediation or arbitration by your\noflice whenever requested by BRI.\" 0J-110).\nI1. The Trial Court correctly found that the Commissioner's\nSeptember 24, 1993 Letter was a further act of bad faith\nand a violation of the Settlement Agreement\n116\n\nOnSeptembe2r4, 1993,theCommissionesrentafurthercertification\nletterto Dr. Israelon behalfof JRC,againcopyingJRC'sFundingand\nPlacemenAtgencies0.3-106;U-107).Inthiscommunicatiotnh,eCommissioner\nannouncetdhattherewere_14abuseinvestigationwshichareinprocesasrising\nfromcomplaints by former BRI staff, present BRI clients, and/or their attorneys,\nand information presented by BRI to DPPC.\" The letter also accused Dr. Israel\npersonally for such abuse. (U-106,1). The Trial Court found that it was the\nnormal practice of DMR not to reveal allegations of abuse to third parties without\nfirst having had them substantiated, and therefore, concluded that this\ncommunication \"constituted a startling departure from DMR's acknowledged\npractice with respect to abuse investigation.\" (F. 132). DMR argues that this\nfactual finding is \"clearly erroneous,\" citing the Commissioner's testimony that\nit was DMR's practice to release such information in response to a \"Freedom of\nInformation Act (FO1A) request.\" (Brief, pp. l12-113). However, the\nCommissioner admitted at trial that his normal practice was not to communicate\nallegations of abuse to third parties until substantiated. (Tr. 11I, 188-189). Thus,\nhe agreed that itwould be unfair to publish such allegations. (Tr. 111, 188-189).\nThe Trial Court's findings are supported by the testimony of the Commissioner\nhimself, 35and it is inexplicable why the Commissioner has not directed this\nCourt to the relevant testimony.\nOn page 4 of the September 24 Letter, the Commissioner required JRC,\nas a condition of certification, to provide him with reports of any incidents which\nhad occurred since 1989 \"except that any reoorts of deaths shall be nrovided by\nOctober 5, 1993.\" (Emphasis original). 03-106). The Trial Court was fully\njustified in concluding that this was misleading and likely to produce the\ndamaging impression that deaths had been occurring at JRC and that JRC had not\n3_ The Commissioner does not attack the finding of the Thai Court, again based\non the Commissioner's own testimony, that he never sent out a letter advising JRC's\nFunding and Placement Agencies of Dr. Israel's vindication when the allegations were\nfound to be unsubstantiated. (Tr. 111,192-193).\n117\n\nbeenreporting them, particularly when this letter was read together with the\nother frivolous allegations made against JRC._\n12. The Commissioner enoaged in bad faith and violated _he\nSettlement A_reement by concocting a biased review of\nJRC's program\na. The Decision to AcQuire a Program Review\nThe Commissioner attacks the Trial Court's findings (F. 136-137)\nconcerning the basis for the independent program review. (Brief, p.116). He\nagain fails to direct this Court to the relevant testimony. The Trial Court found\nthat Dr. Cerreto's testimony was not truthful when she stated that the reason for\nrecommending the independent program review in 1993 was because prior\nevaluations, including the 1991 and 1993 Certification Reports, were insufficient.\n(Tr. X, 44). At trial, Dr. Cerreto testified that she knew what Deputy Counsel\nCasey and Dr. Riley had done in the 1991 evaluation, and had the insufficiency\nof the certification team evaluation in mind when she made her recommendation\nto the Commissioner for an independent review in 1993. fir. X, 136,137).\nHowever, she stated in her deposition that she was not even aware at that time\nthat there was a Certification Team comprised of Deputy Counsel Casey and Dr.\nRiley who were designated to do a certification review of JRC, and was not even\naware of the existence of the 1991 Certification Report until the day of the\ndeposition on April 21, 1995. (Tr. X, 137-139). In addition, Dr. Cerreto\ntestified on cross-examination that she never read the 1993 Certification Team\nReport until two days before the deposition. (Tr. X, 142). When confronted\nwith her testimony, Dr. Cerreto then responded by saying she could not recall\nwhether she testified that her recommendation to review JRC was based on the\n1991 and 1993 Certification Reports. (Tr. X, 147). The Trial Court was fully\njustified in reaching the conclusion which it did concerning the false nature of\nDr. Cerreto's testimony.\nThe Commissioner alsoadmitted attrial that if he had received aletter, such as\nthe September 24 Letter, making allegations of abuse against the head of aprogram, he\nwould be concerned about placing clients in that program. (Tr. 111,187-188).\n118\n\nb. Reuuest for Proposals, (RFP)\nIn its findings, the Trial Court noted that Dr. Cerreto, who was in charge\nof selecting a new \"independent evaluation\" team, conceded that she knew of no\nother instance in which an RFP with a ten-day turnaround time had been sent out\nby DMR, and that she could not provide an explanation for the necessity of such\na short turnaround. (Tr. X, 150,159-160). After the RFP was sent out, Dr.\nCerreto received letters from interested bidders complaining that there was\ninsufficient time to respond, fir. X, 158-159). Despite her claimed desire for\na fair process, she did nothing to expand the deadline, fir. X, 158-159). Dr.\nCerreto also testified that it was the \"policy\" in the Commonwealth to encourage\nthe widest response to an RFP, yet she sent the RFP only to a select group of\npotential bidders. (Tr. X, 151). For this reason, the Trial Court properly\nconcluded that Dr. Cerreto's RFP process was inconsistent with Commonwealth\npolicy.\nc. Rivendell's Propo_ild\nThe Commissioner attacks the Trial Court's findings on the Rivendell\nproposal as being \"abound with mischaracterizations.\" (Brief, p.l16). The\nCommissioner first attacks the Trial Court's finding (F. 145) that Dr. Cerreto\ninaccurately testified that she never requested that Rivendell alter or modify its\nresponse to the RFP. The testimony on this point was uncontroverted. Dr.\nCerreto initially testified that she never requested that Rivendell alter or modify\nits response to the RFP. (Tr. X, 164-165). In response to a request from JRC\ndated October 8, 1993, Deputy Counsel Chow-Menzer provided JRC with a\ndocument that she falsely represented to be Rivendell's \"response\" to the RFP.\n(U-308; Tr. X, 163-164). 37 Significantly, however, the revised Rivendell\nresponse provided to JRC included a fax from Dr. Angela Amado of Rivendell\nto Dr. Cerreto stating, contrary to Dr. Cerreto's sworn testimony, that the\n_7 The representation was utterly false and, as the Trial Court found, the actual\nresponse by Rivendell to the RFP (JRC-310) was never disclosed to JRC until the\ndiscovery process commenced.\n119\n\nRivenderllesponsheadinfactbeenrevisedatDr.Cerreto'srequest.(JRC-307).\nThefactthatDr.Cerretoofferedafrivolousexplanatiofnorthediscrepanciny\nhertestimondyoesnot,contrarytotheCommissionerc'sontentionm,eanthatthe\nTrialCourtwasinanywaycompelletdobelieveDr.Cerreto.\nTheCommissionethrenattacksasclearlyerroneoutsheTrialCourt's\n\"imput[ingl a bad faith motive for DMR's simply providing BRI with the then\ncurrent version of the Rivendell proposal in response to BRI's request for a copy\nof the RFP and Rivendell's proposal.\" (Brief, p. 117). Again, the Commissioner\nmischaracterizes the relevant exhibits. JRC did not request a copy of\n\"Rivendell's then current proposal.\" Deputy Counsel Chow-Menzer's letter of\nOctober 20 falsely stated that the document which was provided was the\n\"responsive proposal submitted by Rivendell. \"_ (U-307). There is no doubt\nthat the actual response (U-310) of Rivendell was not produced until discovery\ncommenced as found by the Trial Court.\nd. Selection of Rivendell\nIn attacking Finding 151, the Commissioner criticizes the Trial Court on\nthe ground that \"trial court found (using the exact language proposed in BRrs\nproposed finding 238, App. 839) that the presence of one individual, Dr. Richard\nAmado, on the six-person team rendered Rivendell 'incapable of doing a fair,\nimpartial and unbiased review' of BRI.\" (Brief, p.l17). First, even a casual\nreview of the record shows differences between proposed finding 238 of JRC and\nthe Trial Court's Finding 151. Second, the Trial Court's finding was not clearly\nerroneous. The Commissioner neglects to point out in his Brief that the\nallegation of bias pertained not simply to one member of the team, but the co-\nleader of the team. (JRC-310, 4). Moreover, the \"Call To Action\" referred to\nin Finding 150 not only equated aversives to political torture, but was also a\nNor was this an insignificant matter. The actual response contained several\nprovisions which, when Dr. Cerreto asked Angela Amado torevise the document, were\ndropped out. Among those provisions were the cost of the evaluation, the fact that Hank\nBersani, who militantly opposed the use of aversives, was one of the first proposed\nevaluators, and, most significantly, on the first full page of that document, a statement\nthat says \"the assembly of a sufficiently qualified team on such notice is close to\nimpossible.\" (Tr. X, 186-187,198).\n120\n\ndocumenwthichwasplainlydirected at JRC. The attachments to the Call To\nAction made serious claims of mistreatment by JRC, including accusations that\nthe Executive Director \"killed two, choked one with a heart attack [sie], then one\nwith a strangle-hold. Everything is so hush, hush.\" (I.J-70). _9\nDr. Cerreto testified that she knew when she received the Call To Action\nthat the document equated the use of aversives with political torture, fir. X,\n170). Dr. Cerreto also knew in July of 1993 that Dr. Richard Amado, the co-\nleader of Rivendell, was listed as the first individual signatory on that document.\n(Tr. X, 170). Incredibly, the following day, during her testimony, Dr. Cerreto\ntotally contradicted her earlier testimony and denied being aware in July of 1993\nthat Dr. Amado was a signatory to the Call to Action. (Tr. XI, 41). The Trial\nCourt was not required to credit Dr. Cerreto's testimony concerning Dr.\nAmado's lack of bias.\ne. Dr. Cerreto's Role\nThe Commissioner argues (Brief, p. I 18) that the Trial Court erred in its\nfindings concerning the inconsistency in Dr. Cerreto's testimony. Significantly,\nhowever, the Commissioner only challenges one of the many inconsistencies in\nDr. Cerreto's testimony, but not the others which are well-documemed and\narticulated in the Trial Court's Findings. The Trial Court did not err in finding\nthat Dr. Cerreto testified that she was the only person from DMR who conducted\nthe review of the Rivendell bias issue. (F. 162). In her direct examination by\nAssistant Attorney General Lucy Wall on July 11, 1995, Dr. Cerreto testified\nthat she was the one at DMR assigned to \"review the issue of bias and advise the\nCommissioner about whether 1 thought Rivendell could provide an unbiased\nreview.\" fir. X, 53-54). That testimony was contradicted the next day on\ncross-examination when she was confronted with her deposition in which she\ntestified that she had nothing to do with the \"givendell bias issue\" since that issue\nwas handled by the Commissioner's special assistant, Jean Tuller. (Tr. XI, 19-\n_9 The \"independence\" of Rivendell is perhaps best sumn'arized by the letter of\nDecember |0 of General Counsel Kim Mordock. On that date, she wrote a letter to\ncounsel for JRC indicating that she was \"appalled\" at the nmterialscontainedinthe JRC\nmotion that had been filed the day before €oncerning Rivendell and was requesting a\nresponse from Rivendell. (U-127).\n121\n\n22). WhenconfrontewdiththeinconsistencDy,r.Cerretostatedthatshecould\nnotrecallhertestimonyfromthepreviousdaywithoutseeingthetranscript.\n(Tr.XI, 22-24). The Trial Court's findings were justified.\n13. The Commissioner and his attorneys improperly\nattempted to conceal the subjects discussed at the Weekly\nMeetin.g._\na. The Commissioner's Testimony\nThe Commissioner argues (Brief, p.121) that he never testified at his\ndeposition or at trial that the \"Tuesday Morning Meetings IWeekly Meetings]\nrelated exclusively to the issue of certification.\" The Commissioner then cites\nFinding 170 and 176. In Finding 170, the Trial Court stated that the\nCommissioner testified at his deposition and at trial that these meetings dealt\n\"strictly\" with the issue of certification. In Finding 176, the Court used the word\n\"exclusively\" instead of \"strictly.\"\nThe statements of the Commissioner which appear at page 121 of his\nBrief are categorically false. The following colloquy is illustrativeofjust one of\nthe examples of the Commissioner's testimony on this subject:\nQ: Commissioner, starting in the summer or fall of 1993,\nyou started having weekly meetings concerning BRI's\napplication for certification; is that correct?\nA: Yes.\nQ: Those meetings dealt strictly with the issue of BRI's\napplication for certification?\nA: Yes.\nQ: They were not assembled for any other purpose?\nA: That's correct.\n(Tr. III, 72-73). Further, there was ample basis for the Trial Court's finding on\nthis issue of the substance of the Weekly Meetings based on his deposition\ntestimony, submitted at trial, where the Commissioner confirmed that the sole\npurpose for forming the Weekly Meetings was to gather information about the\ncertification application. (Tr. IV, 120-121).\nIn addition, to the extent that the Commissioner is attempting to argue\nin his Brief that the Trial Court incorrectly used the word \"exclusively\" instead\nof \"strictly,\" this distinction was insignificant for the Commissioner. When the\n122\n\nCommissionewraspresentedwiththeWeeklyMeetingworkplandocuments\nwhichshowedthepatentfalsehoodof histestimonyh,ewasaskedandhe\nansweretdhefollowingquestion:\nQ: And you would agree with me that you testified two\ntimes, i think in fact, three times yesterday, before 1\npresented these documents to you that the\nsubject of these meetings was certification only? That\nwas your testimony before I presented these documents\nto you; correct?\nA: Yes.\n(Tr. IV, 120) (emphasis supplied). The Commissioner's argument that he never\nused these words is factually inaccurate and a gross misrepresentation of the\nproceedings below. The fact that on examination by his counsel the\nCommissioner attempted to proffer an explanation for his misstatements after the\n\"cat was out of the bag\" and the Trial Court declined to believe the patently false\nexplanation is irrelevant. The Trial Court was fully justified in its\ncharacterization of the Commissioner's false testimony concerning the alleged\npurpose of the Weekly Meetings.\nb. Dr. Cerreto's Testimony\nThe Commissioner again mischaracterizes the record when he argues\n(Brief, p. 123) that the Trial Court erred in its finding on Dr. Cerreto's deposition\ntestimony regarding the purpose of the Weekly Meetings. The Commissioner\nacknowledges in his Brief at page 123 that Dr. Cerreto responded \"Yes\" to the\nquestion at her deposition whether the Weekly Meeting's charge was \"strictly\"\nto determine whether JRC's use of Level III interventions complied with DMR\nregulations. (Tr. X, 113). The Commissioner then notes that Dr. Cerreto\nattempted to correct at trial the \"misinterpretation of her deposition testimony\"\noffered by JRC's counsel by citing two examples of topics discussed at the\nmeetings which did not relate to JRC's certification, and argues that it was\nincorrect for the Trial Court to conclude that she lied on this subject in her\ndeposition since Dr. Cerreto \"readily acknowledg[ed]\" the discussion of issues\nunrelated to JRC's certification.\n123\n\nThe Trial Court made no finding that Dr. Cerreto lied on this subject.\nThe Trial Court merely stated that the Commissioner's testimony was \"echoed\"\nby Dr. Cerreto, who testified in her deposition that the purpose of the Weekly\nMeetings was limited strictly to the issue of certification. (F. 170, n.34). The\nCommissioner's statement that the Trial Court found that Dr. Cerreto had lied\nis a distortion of the actual findings so that they can be attacked as \"clearly\nerroneous\". Even if the Trial Court had made this conclusion, Dr. Cerreto's\ndirect testimony that the Weekly Meetings were limited to certification issues\nwas hardly an indication of her candor, since she testified after the Commissioner\nwas forced to admit that the Weekly Meetings were used to plot strategy on how\nto close JRC.\nc. The Attorney-Client Privilege\nThe Commissioner characterizes as \"unfounded\" the Trial Court's\nfindings that the Commissioner attempted to conceal the subject of the Weekly\nMeetings from the Trial Court. (Brief, p.124)_ The Commissioner goes on to\nstate that the Trial Court's findings on this subject \"form the basis\" for\nconclusions of perjury, governmental malfeasance and misconduct. Contrary to\nthe Commissioner's argument, it is plain that the misconduct in this case was not\nbased exclusively on the efforts to conceal the subject of the Weekly Meetings\nfrom the Trial Court and counsel. The Trial Court's Corollary Findings speak\nfor themself, and they involve many more examples of misconduct than the\nattempts to hide the subject of the Weekly Meetings from the Trial Court.\nThe Commissioner first asserts that the Trial Court found that the notes,\nworkplans and agendas from the Weekly Meetings were produced by DMR in\ndiscovery. The Trial Court did not make this finding. Rather, the Trial Court\nfound that the existence of these meetings did not become known until the eve\nof trial, as part of the discovery process. (F. 169).\nThe Commissioner acknowledges on page 124 of his Brief that the\ndocuments were originally produced in a redacted form. When the exhibits\nrelating to the Weekly Meetings were first presented to the Trial Court, the\nCommissioner was ordered, upon JRC's request, to produce unredacted versions.\nfir. II1, 230-231). Assistant Attorney General Yogman represented that the\n124\n\nunredacteddocuments would be produced the following day. (Tr. III, 230-231).\nThey were not produced on that day. On July 7, 1995, DMR produced a\nnumber of additional documents which had fewer redactions than the first\ndocuments produced, but still contained numerous redactions. (JRC-321). The\nTrial Court then ordered DMR to produce the fully-unredacted documents, which\nDMR did on July 11, 1995. (Tr. X, 79; JRC-293 thru JRC-304). Even on this\ndate, however, DMR did not fully comply with the Trial Court's order, and four\nunredacted documents were subsequently produced on July 12, 1995. (JRC-322).\nThe Commissioner argues (Brief, p. 124) that the difficulty concerning the\nproduction of unredacted documents was the basis for the Trial Court's Finding\n177 that the Commissioner attempted to conceal the subject of the Weekly\nMeetings from the Trial Court. It is clear from reading Finding 177 that the\nTrial Court's findings do not relate exclusively to the controversy surrounding\nthe \"redaction\" of documents. _° Rather, the more salient finding concerning the\nredaction issue is the Trial Court's Corollary Finding 16 that counsel acted with\n\"intransigence and defiance\" with respect to the Trial Court's order to produce\nthese documents, and the Trial Court's concern that the information for which\nthe attorney-cllent privilege was originally invoked in support of these redactions\nwas done so without any basis in fact or in law. The fact that there continued\nto be redactions in the documents produced on July 7, 1995, and even redactions\nin the set of documents produced on July 11, 1995, demonstrates the obvious\nfrustration which the Trial Court felt concerning the non-compliance with its\norders. (Tr. X, 79).\nThe Commissioner surprisingly blames JRC for DMR's improper\nredactions by not immediately objecting to DMR's redactions as not legitimate\nunder the attorney-client privilege. However, JRC was justified in expecting\ncounsel for the Commissioner to make a good faith effort to comply with the\nrules of discovery and not omit the material which was not actually protected by\nany privilege. As the documents were revealed to the Trial Court, however, it\n_o Indeed, the Trial Court's Finding 177 relates to the Trial Court's view that\nCommissioner Campbell was attempting to conceal activities from the Trial Court. It\nalso refers tothe Commissioner's false testimony.\n12.5\n\nbecamcelearthatcounsefol rtheCommissionheardmisrepresenttehdeexistence\noftheattorney-cliepnrtivilegeinanattempttowithholddamaginignformation.\nApartyhasadutynottorespondtodiscoveryinawaywhichcreates\nafraudonthetrialcourtand\"sentientlsyetsinmotionanunconscionabslceheme\ncalculatetdointerferewiththejudicialsystem'sabilityimpartiallytoadjudicate\na matterby improperlyinfluencingthe trier or unfairlyhamperingthe\npresentationof the opposingparty's claimor defense.\" SeeRockdalg\nManagemeCnol;..

Once JRC\nmade a proper request for production of documents, the Commissioner through\ncounsel could not intentionally \"avoid its obligations by filing misleading or\nevasive responses.\" Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 929 (lst Cir.\n1988).

Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677,\n682 (1958). The Commissioner's counsel withheld damaging information from\nJRC and the Trial Court under the guise of privilege. The fact that the\nCommissioner on appeal presses only two entries as being privileged, although\nthe original documents contained scores of redacted entries sf.E_U-190 through\nU-225) for which the Commissioner alleged attorney-client privilege, shows that\ncounsel for the Commissioner did not have a good faith basis for claiming the\nprivilege in the first place.\nThe Commissioner as the party claiming the protection of the attorney-\nclient privilege had the burden \"to establish those facts that are the essential\nelements of the privileged relationship.\" Martin v. Valley National Bank of'\nArizona, 140 FRD 291,302 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), quoting from Von Bulow v. Von\nBulow, 811 F.2d 136, 144 (2nd Cir.), cert denied, 481 U.S. 1015 (1987). As\nthe proponent of the privilege, the Commissioner was required to establish not\nmerely the privileged relationship, but all essential elements of the privilege.\nMartin v. Valley National Bank of Arizona, 140 F.R.D. at 302. The\nCommissioner only claims that two specific entries s(_g JRC-293,1,5) regarding\nDr. Daignault and the JRC receivership were protected by the attorney-client\n126\n\nprivilege,andneverarguedbelowthatthesedocumentwsereprotectedbyany\notherprivilege.(Brief,p.126).\nTheTrialCourtdidnoterrinrulingthattheattorney-clienptrivilegedid\nnotapplytothesetwoentries.First,anycommunicatiobnetweenthenon-legal\nstaffof DMRandtheCommissionerergardingregulatorydecisionwsasnota\ncommunicatiobnetweentheattorneyandtheclientsubjecttoaprivilege.See\nBarn¢._ v, Harris, 61 Mass. (7 Cush) 576 (1851) (no privilege if client discloses\nto non-attorney). Second, to the extent that there were conversations between the\nCommissioner and his attorneys documented in the workplans, the Trial Court\nwas warranted in finding such discussions were in furtherance of future public\ncorruption and the interference with the orderly administration of justice. The\nTrial Court specifically found that the Commissioner's investigation into the role\nof Dr. Daignault was baseless and a bad faith attack on a Court official.\nLikewise, the plans regarding the receivership of JRC was part of the overall\nplan to regulate JRC out of business, which was also in bad faith and part of the\npervasive public corruption found in this case. Theattorney-client privilege only\nattaches to communications neces:;ary to the proper conduct of legitimate legal\nbusiness, and does not protect communications regarding future fraudulent or\nunlawful conduct. _ Panell v. Rosa, 328 Mass. 594, 596 (1917). Third, the\nconversations between the Commissioner and his attorneys documented in the\nworkplan of September 7, 1993 occurred during a Weekly Meeting when all of\nthe DMR staff, including the DMR Press Secretary, were present to discuss JRC.\nThis was a meeting to discuss DMR policy regarding JRC; it was not a closed\nsession whereby the Commissioner and his attorneys shared legal advice. The\nwords \"Policy Development\" appears in bold print on top of the document.\n(JRC-293). The entries involve tasks ordered by the Commissioner to attorneys\nand non-legal staff alike. The Commissioner's assertion that the attorney-client\nprivilege attached to these meetings merely because his attorneys were present\nis a back-door attempt to assert an executive privilege, which is neither\nrecognized in Massachusetts, _ Babets v. Secretary of Human.Services, 403\nMass. 230, 232-39 (1988), nor raised by the Commissioner. There was no error\nby the Trial Court in deciding that these entries, like the scores of others\n127\n\noriginallyredactedbytheCommissioner's counsel, were not protected by the\nattorney-client privilege.\nIn any event, the decision that these entries did not constitute attorney-\nclient privileged material and were discoverable in unredacted form, was a\ndiscovery matter within the discretion of the Trial Court. Based upon the entire\nrecord of bad faith, fraud on the Trial Court, and public corruption, even if there\nwere error, the discovery of these two entries did not impact on the\nCommissioner's substantial rights requiring reversal. ,See G. L. c. 231, § 119;\nsee also Symmons v. O'Keefe, 419 Mass. 288, 303 n.13 (1995);\nBoston Edison Co., 38 Mass. App. Ct. 344, 355 (1995).\n14. The Commi_si0ner's December 15, 1993 Certification\nLetter contained false and defamatory statements about\nJRC and constituted another act of contempt and bad\nfaith by the Commissioner\nThe Commissioner attacks findings that the Trial Court made concerning\nthe Commissioner's letter of December 15, 1993, as being speculative and not\nsupported by the contrary evidence. (Brief, p.130).\nOn the first page of the December 15 Letter, the Commissioner stated\nthat JRC's \"failure to report a death in 1991 made it impossible for me to fulfill\nmy responsibilities under this regulation.\" (U-128,1). (Emphasis supplied). The\nfollowing paragraph stated as follows: \"JRC has in the past failed to report\nand serious injuries as required by law. Instead, you have admitted that even\nwhen a young woman died, JRC's response was to leave a telephone message\nwith the secretary in tl,e local office and to speak briefly with a non-management\nlocal employee... No report was made to the Commissioner's office. No\nwritten report was ever submitted.\" (-O-128, I). The Trial Court made a\nnumber of findings concerning this letter. First, the Trial Court concluded that\nthe Commissioner inaccurately stated that JRC had failed to report \"deaths\" in\nthe plural. The Trial Court was warranted in not believing the Commissioner's\nexplanation that this was a typographical error but rather intentional based upon\n128\n\ntheTrial Court's observance of the demeanor of the Commissioner and his other\ninconsistent testimonyJ _\nSecond, the Trial Court also correctly found that, contrary to the\nCommissioner's statement at trial on June 29, 1995, there was more than\nsufficient information to permit DMR to have investigated the death. (F. 58).\nDuring his testimony on June 29, 1995, the Commissioner emphatically\ncontended that JRC's failure to report the death made it impossible for his office\nto investigate the matter. '2 The Commissioner's testimony was not, as he now\nargues, based on inadmissible speculation. The Commissioner had undertaken\nan inquiry into this matter and had seen fit to make an allegation in the\nDecember 15Letter concerning JRC's alleged failure to report the death. It was\nentirely proper for the Trial Court to allow questions to the Commissioner on this\nsubject. '_ At the end of his trial testimony, the Commissioner adntitted that he\nwas aware on December 15, 1993 that DMR had sufficient information to\n,k Indeed, theCommissioner's various certificati9n letters are remarkably free from\ntypographical errors.\n'; For example, he testified that this office didnot receive information aboutthe\ndeath that was \"discemable.\" (Tr. IV, 191). tie testified that \"misinformation\"had\nprevented DMR's General Counsel's office from investigating the death and from\ndetermining \"whoitwas.\" (Tr. IV, 97). Hetestified that before the December 15Letter\nwas sent out to funding agencies, he had undertaken an inquiry to find out the actual\nfacts. (Tr. IV, 98). Healso testified that the infomtation which was obtained concerning\nthis death \"onlyidentified the approximate time of the month and the person,\" but did\n\"not identify anything beyond that.\" (Tr. IV, 10l). He reiterated onJune 29, 1995that\nitwas \"impossible\" for his agency to have investigated the death. (Tr. IV, 130).\n,3 As the Trial Courtnotes (F. 214), a document was faxed tothe court house on\nJune 30, 1995 from DMR which was the \"actual client death report form\" for L. C..\n(JRC-266). When the trial resumed on July 5, 1995, DMR counsel, now knowing that\nthere was a document which completely contradicted the Commissioner's testimony,\nengaged in \"damage control\" with the Commissioner by having him admit, contrary to\nhis testimony on June 29, 1995 that the document did contain sufficient information to\nconduct an investigation. (Tr. VI, 36). The Commissioner then attemptedtotestify that\nthe death was not investigated because there was an on-going law enforcement\ninvestigation of the same incident. (Tr. VI, 37). Attorney Yogman was obviously aware\nof this document, since she stated on July 5, 1995 that the document was produced in\ndiscovery and contained an identification number of DMR, (Tr. VI, 31), but did not\ninterject while the Commissioner gave his original false testimony of this subject,\n129\n\nconduct an invest!g__ti_:_ in 1991. fir. VI, 115,118-119,122). The finding was\ncorrect.\nI:,. _There was uncontroverted evidence al trial that lhg\nCommissioner's _trcam 0f falsg and defam_tor_\n_mcnls about JR_ in his cerUficalion and olher letters\n€_t_,_,_eda dramatic reduction in JRC's student census and\nThe Commissioner argues that the Trial Court made clearly erroneous\nfindings concerning efforts by DMR officials to interfere with JRC's relationship\nwith its Funding and Placement Agencies ina 1994 meeting. (Brief, pp. 132-133).\nThere was no error. The circumstances surrounding this meeting were as\nfollows. On January 28, 1994, tile Trial Court issued a preliminary injunction\nrequiring the Commissioner to send out notices to JRC's Funding and Placement\nAgencies that the DMR certification process should not adversely affect decisions\nabout the placement of students at JRC. (App. 215). However, after the order\nwas issued, JRC learned that DMR had arranged a meeting with a New York\nAgency that funds students at JRC to be held in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nfir. VIIA, 88). The N_w York Agency provides seventy percent of/RC's\nstudents, fir. VIIA, 89). JRC requested that GAL Briggs be allowed to attend\nthe Worcester meeting as a neutral party. (Tr. VIIA, 89).\nThe Commissioner's counsel initially agreed that there would be no\nproblem with GAL Briggs attending the meeting with the New York Agency.\n(Tr. VIIA, 89). DMR subsequently changed its position and informed JRC that\nit had \"no position\" on GAL Briggs attending the meeting. (Tr. VIIA, 90; U-\n138). After an exchange of correspondence between counsel, the meeting was\nsuddenly cancelled. (Tr. VIIA, 90). Essentially, after the Commissioner had\nreflected on his counsel's agreement to allow a neutral party to attend, he\nabruptly cancelled the meeting. DMR then held a separate telephone conference\nwith the New York Agency officials without notifying JRC, the parents, or GAL\nBriggs. (App. 472; Tr. IV, 70; DMR-80,¶I2). This private telephone\nconference defeated the entire purpose of the original agreement to allow a\n130\n\nneutral party to attend the meeting with the New York Agency.\" After the\nmeeting, communications were sent out to a significant number of OMRDD\nclients of JRC advising them that the children would be leaving JRC. (DMR-\n80). There was a more than adequate basis for the Trial Court's finding (F. 221)\nthat the meeting with New York Agency was a continuation of the\nCommissioner's campaign of interfering with JRC's relationship with its Funding\nand Placement Agencies.\n16. The Commissioner had no good faith basis for imposing\nthe conditions contained in his Certification L¢11¢f\n9f F_bruary 9, 1994.\nThe Commissioner asserts that the Trial Court made clearly erroneous\nfindings with respect to the Commissioner's February 9 Letter. (Brief, p.134).\nIn particular, the Trial Court found that there was no basis for the requirement\nthat JRC conduct independent psychiatric reviews for all of its clients, The Trial\nCourt also found that the Commissioner did not even read the reports of the\npsychiatrists. (F. 229). The Trial Court also concluded that the Commissioner\ncould not identify any credible reason for the imposition of a further condition\nregarding the need for medical evaluations of all JRC students.\nWith respect tothe psychiatric evaluation, the Commissioner testified that\nno psychiatrist gave him any information which suggested a need for these\nevaluations or information that the client's behavioral problems could be treated\npsychiatrically, fir. IV, 152-153). In addition, to the extent that any of these\nclients had unmet psychiatric needs, the Commissioner failed to consider filing\nmotions for psychiatric evaluations in the ongoing substituted judgment\nproceedings. (Tr. IV, 153). Furthermore, he required evaluations for all sixty\nJRC students, even though he admitted on the witness stand that he had no\nevidence that there were unmet psychiatric needs, fTr. IV, 153-154). Finally,\n,a The Trial Courthad before it, as an exhibit, an internal memorandum of DMR\nconcerning the proposed meeting with New York Agency. The memorandum described\nthe purpose of the meeting to discuss the \"status of the litigation\" between DMR and\nJRC. (U-132). There was no indication why a New York funding agency would be so\ninterested in this litigation that itwas necessary to travel to Massachusetts for a face to\nface meeting with DMR officials.\n131\n\ntheimpositionofthisrequiremenctontainednoprovisionasto how JRC was\nsupposed to pay for these evaluations. 4s\nWith respect to the medical evaluations, the Trial Court's findings were\nfully supported by the record. This condition had to be completed within eighty\ndays and involved all JRC students in the JRC program. (Tr. IV, 155). This\ncondition was imposed even though JRC possessed a comprehensive system for\nmedical monitoring, which included a nunther of full-time nurses, as well as a\nnumber of consulting physicians from some of the leading teaching hospitals in\nthe world, fl'r. VIIA, 93-99). The Commissioner could not identify any\nphysicians who had advised DMR that there were unmet medical needs for JRC\nstudents, fir. IV, 157), and he concurred thatwhen the medical evaluations were\nundertaken, all JRC students were found to be in good health. (Tr. VI, 95-96).\nThe Commissioner falsely states in his Brief at page 136, footnote 119\nthat JRC's own medical examinations of the JRC students were \"cursory and\nsuperficial\", citing DMR-31, and that the medical examinations conducted by the\nphysicians hired by DMR in 1994 found that the JRC students had unmet medical\nneeds. There is nothing in DMR-31 that remotely supports those assertions. In\nfact, the medical evaluations stated the opposite. (JRC-284). _ The\n,s It was only after the negotiations in/',lay of 1994that the Commissioner agreed\nthat the Department would pay for these evaluations. The letter of February 9th made\nno provision as tohow JRC would pay for these evaluations.\nThe Commissioner names 22 students infootnote 199of his Brief tosupport his\nfallacious argument that the physicians hired by DMR in 1994 found unmet medical\nneeds. For purposes of brevity, JRC will address the first six names cited by the\nConmfissioner in footnote 199 of his brief. The medical report on Paul M. actually\nstated the following: \"This is a slightly obese, but otherwise healthy looking young man\nwith marked gynecomastia. He isobviously followed closely byvarious specialists which\nreflects the good medical care that heisreceiving inhis present setting.\" (JRC-284, 30).\nFor student Terry P., the medical evaluation actually stated: \"Terry P.'s medical needs\nseem tobe well addressed.\" (JRC-284, 59). For JRC student Peter B., DMR's medical\nevaluation actually stated: \"Patient with mental retardationin good health and adequate\nnutrition status with seizure disorders controlled by medication. Continue present\nmedical and nutritional management.\" (JRC-284, 62). For JRC student Janine C.,\nDMR's medical evaluation actually stated: \"On examination Janine is a well-developed,\nwell-nourished white female who is 5'2\" tall . . . physical examination revealed no\nproblems.\" (JRC-284, 63,65). For JRC student Michael S., DMR's medical evaluations\nactually stated: \"Patient ingood physical health, well-nourished, not overweight.\" (ton'd)\n132\n\nCommissioner also incorrectly states (Brief, p.135, n.198) that the psychiatric\nexaminations conducted by DMR psychiatrists in 1994 recommended\ndiscontinuation or reduction in the use of aversives. ° Taken by themselves, the\nrequirements of psychiatric and medical examinations might not be unreasonable\ndepending on the circumstances. However, the Trial Court was fully justified,\nby taking this evidence together with other evidence which it had before it, in\ndetermining that these costly procedures were not the result of a good faith\nregulatory action, but a baseless continuation of the regulatory war of attrition\nwhich the Commissioner was waging against JRC.\n17. The Comn_issioner Violated The luly 5. 1994 Aereement\n(con'd) (JRC-284, 98). For JRC student Antonio S., DMR's medical evaluation actually\nstated: 'This is a well-built young man who appears in excellent physical health,\nhowever, he is quite overweight, lie does not exhibit any psychiatric or behavioral\nproblems.\" 0RC-284, 106). Although only six of the evaluations are.cited herein, the\nother DMR medical evaluations similarly found the students ingood health andreceiving\ngood medical care with statements and reports such as: 'The patient receives excellent\nhealth maintenance services.\" (JRC-284, 71). The DMR medical evaluations, as a\nwhole, establish unequivocally, that the JRC medical services for its students are\nexcellent.\nd7 Again, for the purposes of brevity, the first six examples cited by the\nCommissioner in his brief will be addressed. DMR psychiatric evaluation for William\nM. actually stated: \"At the present time it appearsthat Mr. M. isdoing extremely well\nat BRI and has made good progress in this well-structured setting.\" (JRC-285, 10).\nDMR's psychiatric evaluation on Mary Claire J. actually stated: 'Overall Mary Claire\nappears tohave made very significant progress during her time atBRI. All self-injurious\nbehaviors have almost vanished and other behaviors appear to be decreasing as Mary\nClaire feels more incontrol of some aspects of her behavior, contract and her life The\ncurrent program of not having her GED on her at all times also appears to be moving\nalong satisfactorily.\" (JRC-285, 19). For JRC student Edward F., DMR's psychiatric\nevaluation actually stated: \"It appears that Mr. F. has done very well during the course\nofhis stay atBRI. There isno doubt that his behaviors have significantly improved over\nthe course of this period. \" 0RC-285,23). TbeDMRpsychiatrieevaluationofJohnC.\nactually stated: \"Mr. C. is athirty year old male with autism and mental retardation who\nappears to have done relatively well during his stay at JRC. It appears that most\ndisruptive behaviors have been adequately addressed with behavior program in place.\nConsideration should be given toweaning the GED in order to provide care inthe least\nrestrictive environment.' 0RC-285, 28). For JRC student Antonio S., the DMR\npsychiatric evaluationreport actually stated: \"Overall, itappears thatTony has done quite\nwell in the well-structured environment of BRI.' (JRC-285, 36). Finally, the DMR\npsychiatric evaluation for Korren C. stated: \"Overall,Korren appears to be doing quite\nwell in his current placement.\" (/RC-285, 54). Theother DMR psychiatric evaluations\nconducted in 1994contain similar laudatory statements regarding the JRC program.\n133\n\nThe Commissioner argues (Brief, p.137) that the July 5 Letter did not\ninclude agreements, but was something that merely imposed conditions upon\nJRC. This argument is false. The Trial Court concluded that \"agreements were\nreached and were embodied in the letter of July 5, 1994.\" The Commissioner\nstates in the first paragraph of his July 5, 1994 letter that: \"This extension is\ngranted to permit BRI to comply with detailed plans set forth in the\nagreements reached between BRI and the Department in the course of the last\nseven weeks.\" (Emphasis supplied). 0.1-152,1). In the second paragraph of the\nletter, the Commissioner stated that the \"_ are the result of good faith\ndiscussions betweeo BRI and the Department and set forth a clear course of\naction,\" (U-152,1). (Emphasis supplied). Contrary to the Commissioner's\nassertion, the individual agreements concerning the eight remaining conditions\nimposed obligations upon DMR which were subsequently violated. The\nCommissioner offers no explanation as to why he utilized the term \"agreement\"\nin the July 5 Letter, if there were no obligations imposed upon his agency. The\nTrial Court was fully justified in concluding that there was an agreement which\nwas breached by DMR.\nWith respect to the violation of Condition 1, the Trial Court made\nfindings concerning the treatment plan for student W,M. In order to avoid\nconfusion over Condition 1, Dr. Worsham met with Dr. Cerreto to develop a\nprototype treatment plan. After extensive discussions, an agreement was reached\nconcerning a prototype treatment plan and Dr. Cerreto signed off by initialling\neach page of the treatment plan. fir. VIII, 136-146). The prototype treatment\nplan became the model by which every other treatment plan was written.\n(Tr. VIII, 147). Between June and November of 1994, Dr. Worsham of JRC\nspent virtually all of his time rewriting treatment plans. (Tr. VIII, 150).\nDr. Worsham mailed the rewritten treatment plans to Dr. Cerreto as required.\n(JRC-290). Dr. Cerreto never responded that any of the treatment plans that\nJRC provided failed to conform to the prototype plan, or to the DMR\nregulations, fir. VIII, 149-150). The Trial Court made no clearly erroneous\nfinding with respect to the treatment plan issue, and the Commissioner identifies\nno particular finding as clearly erroneous.\n134\n\nTheTrial Court also made findings concerning the Commissioner's\nviolation of subparagraph 6 of Condition 1. (F. 242-244). That agreement\nrequired that for a _period of one year beginning July 1, 1994, the Department\nwould review the implementation of the behavior modification plan for six\nindividuals served at BRI for the purpose of monitoring BRrs compliance with\nthe Department's behavior modification regulations.\" (U-152). In the fall of\nlg94, DMR selected six students and assigned psychologists to conduct a review\nof their plans. Ultimately, those psychologists produced six reports upon which\nthe C,_mmissioner relied in his January 20 Letter, finding that JRC had not met\nthe conditions of certifieatlon. (1_I-166).\nOn November 17, 1994, the Commissioner asked Drs. Thomas Linscheid\nand Brian lwata to conduct a \"systems\" review of the JRC program and a review\nof two additional individuals in the program, despite the fact that the six\nimplementation reviews as agreed were already underway. (U-158; Tr. IV,\n218). On November 23, 1994, the Commissioner mailed a letter to Dr. Israel\ninforming him that these two new psychologists were coming to JRC in order to\nreview \"the implementation of behavior modification plans and the JRC program,\npursuant to our agreement under Condition 1 of the July 5, 1994 Certification\nLetter and [various DMR regulations].\" (U-150). It is significant that the\nCommissioner again referred to the July 5 Letter as an \"agreement.\" The\nCommissioner conceded in his testimony that the six individual assessments\nrequired by Condition 1 had been completed by the time Drs. Linscheid and\nlwata were assigned to undertake the two additional reviews. (Tr. IV, 221).\nThe Commissioner could offer no cr_ible reason for his breach of the July 5\nagreement. The fact that the Commissioner ultimately decided to back down on\nthis issue does not make the Trial Court's finding that the additional review was\nin violation of the July 5 agreement was clearly erroneous. The Trial Court's\nconclusion that the additional review was a violation of the July 5 agreement was\nwarranted and essentially admitted to by the Commissioner during his testimony.\nThe Commissioner also argues that the Trial Court made a clearly\nerroneous finding that DMR refused to mediate this dispute. (Brief, p.139,\nn.203). In a letter of November 28, 1994, JRC requested arbitration under\n135\n\nParagraph B-2 regarding the breach of the July 5 agreement. (JRC-282). In\nresponse, JRC received a communication from Deputy Counsel Margaret Chow-\nMenzer declining to mediate. (U-60), 48 The Trial Court's finding was\nsupported by the record.\n18. The Commissioner's January 20. 1995 Certification\nLetter and his March 23, 1995 Dccertifieation of IRC\nwere f_rthcr acts of bad faith and violations of the\nSes_lcmcn_ A_reement\nIn his Brief at page 140, the Commissioner first attacks the Trial Court's\nfinding (F. 249) that the January 20 Letter required JRC to discontinue Level I11\ncertilication lbr six individuals. The Commissioner argues that this finding isnot\ncorrect since the certification letter gave BRI a meaningful choice either to\nconform to DMR's regulations on Level III aversives or to exclude Level III\naversives from these individuals' treatment plans. The Trial Court's factual\nfinding was not clearly erroneous. The January 20 Letter itself made plain that\nJRC was not permitted to utilize Level 111procedures for six clients indefinitely,\nand that if there was no certification application pending for these six individuals\nwithin thirty days of January 20, 1995, JRC would have to begin modifying the\ntreatments to delete Level I11procedures. (JRC-166, 9). While it is technically\ntrue that JRC was provided with the opportunity to reapply for certification, the\nrecord supports that the Trial Court was fully warranted in believing that this\n\"reapplication\" was not a fair or meaningful process. JRC had already submitted\nvoluminous treatment plans to DMR following the prototype plan approved by\nDr. Cerreto. Yet, it was precisely this prototype that the Commissioner found\nto be deficient in his January 20 l.etter. Moreover, given the past bad faith\nregulatory actions, it could hardly be anticipated that the re-application for\ncertification process described in the January 20 Letter had even a remote chance\nof being granted.\n'_ While Deputy Chow-Menzer went on tostate that the matter couldbe mediated\n\"not withstanding our legal position,\" the point of the Trial Court's finding is that itwas\nnot mediated pursuant to Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement Agreement. Moreover, the\nCommissioner cited JRC in his letter of January 20 for allegedly \"barring Dr. Linscheid\nand Dr. lwata inviolation of Condition 1.\" (U-166, 7).\n136\n\nTheCommissioner next argues that the Trial Court incorrectly concluded\nthat there was a \"conflict\" between the Trial Court's approval of B.S.'s\nindividual treatment plan in the substituted judgment proceedings conducted by\nthe Trial Court and the Commissioner's January 20 Letter. (Brief, p.140).\nHowever, the Trial Court's finding on this conflict (F. 249) is taken almost\nverbatim from the testimony of the Commissioner himself, fir. IV, 231-232). 49\nThe Commissioner acknowledged in his testimony that the actions which he took\nin this letter were inconsistent and in conflict with treatment orders of the Trial\nCourt, including the substituted judgment treatment plan decision in the case of\nJRC student B.S. fir. IV, 231,232). _° The Commissioner's contention that\nthere was an incorrect legal conclusion drawn by the Trial Court concerning this\nconflict is not supported by his own testimony.\nIn addition, the Commissioner cannot deny that his January 20 Letter was\nin complete conflict with the assurances he gave to the Trial Court in the Report\nto the Court. In his Report to the Court of September 22, 1993, the\nCommissioner stated that, \"DMR has not taken and will not take any action\nwhich jeopardizes the health and welfare of JRC clients, or which interferes with\nany court-approved program.\" (App. 158). (Emphasis supplied), Despite this\nassurance, the certification letter issued on January 20, 1995 purported to grant\nJRC a one and one-half year certification, but again imposed a set of conditions\nand terminated treatments in violation of the Settlement Agreement. (U-166).\nThe Commissioner admitted that he ordered specific treatments terminated on\nJanuary 20 without reviewing all of the medical reports, even though he testified\nthat he had spent tens of thousands of dollars on the medical and psychiatric\n,9 The Commissioner admitted at trial that his decision to exclude student B.S.\nfrom JRC's certificationwas based on the reportof psychologist Dr. Angela Duarte,and\nthat the Trial Court, ata treatment plan review held for B.S. one month before the\nJanuary 20 Letter was signed, found Dr. Duarte's testimony on B.S. to lack adequate\nfactual foundation, and thatitwas not credible. (Tr. IV, 228-231; S.A. 56)\n5o DMR fully participated in the five-day treatment plan review of B.S..\nSignificantly, the psychologist, Dr. Angela Duarte, uponwhom the Commissioner relies\nfor his decision on B.S. inthe January 20 Letter, was found not credible by thejudge in\nthe B.S. case, and her testimony on B.S. lacked an adequate foundation. The full text\nof the Findings in the B.S. case are at S.A. 45-66.\n137\n\nreports. HealsoconcedetdhathewasawareonJanuary20, 1995, that the\nmedical evaluations showed no evidence that any of the students for whom\ntreatments were terminated suffered adverse health effects from such treatments,\nbut that the medical care provided at JRC was satisfactory. (Tr. VI, 95-97). In\naddition, the Commissioner did not read the psychiatric evaluations, although he\ntestified that they did not identify any \"significant problem\" and he did not think\nthat they contained any criticism of the treatments terminated, fir. Vi, 191-\n192).\nThe Commissioner next attacks the Trial Court's finding (F. 250) that\nthere was nothing in DMR regulations which gives the Commissioner the power\nto grant or deny certification on a client-by-client basis. (Brief, p.14t).\nHowever, the regulations at 104 CMR §20.15(4)(0 set forth that a program\nshould be certified, and leave the decision on substituted judgment for individuals\nto the directive of the Trial Court.S t\nFinally, the Commissioner attacks the Trial Court's finding concerning\nthe Specialized Food Program. (F. 251). Again, it is unclear which specific\nportion of the finding the Commissioner is contending isclearly erroneous, since\nthe only finding that was made concerning this program -- that the\nCommissioner's team of doctors concluded that there were no adverse health\neffects and that the Commissioner failed to identify any medical evidence to\nsupport this decision -- is taken from DMR documents and the Commissioner's\nst The regulations at 104 CMR 20.15(4)(I), state: \"No Behavior Modification\nPlansemploying Level I11interventions may beimplemented except in a _ or a\ndistinct part of a t_ro_ram that meets the standards established by 104CMR 20.15(4) and\nthat is therefore specially certified by the Department as having authority to administer\nsuch treatment...

Yet the truth, as the Commissioner's\nown medical and certification teams found, was that there was no adverse health\neffects from the Specialized Food Program. 5_ The medical evaluations\ndemonstrate that the clients at JRC were well nourished. (JRC-284). The\nCommissioner attempts to read inferences into the Trial Court's decision and then\nattacks those inferences as clearly erroneous. Neither the Trial Court's findings\nof fact nor the inferences which the Commissioner alleges the Trial Court made\nwere clearly erroneous. _\n19. The Commissioner attempted to dama_,e JRC financially\nby attemming to reduce its rate of reimbursement and\nobstructed iustice by attempting to prevent JRC from\npayin_ its trial counsel\nThe Commissioner asserts, in a completely conclusory fashion, that DMR\ndealt fairly with JRC on contract issues and that its efforts to negotiate a contract\nwith JRC were \"well-intentioned.\" (Brief, p.143). As the Conurtissioner\nacknowledges at page 142, IRC's rate of reimbursement has historically been set\nby DPS. In December of 1993, some three months after DMR commenced\nregulatory war of attrition, DMR questioned whether DPS should continue to set\nss As noted snnra, the Commissioner testified that he was aware that the medical\nevaluations showed no evidence that any of the students had suffered adverse health\naffects from thisprocedure. In addition, the Commissioner furtheracknowledged that\nhe banned Specialized Food, even though he did not consult any medical professional\nabout the possible effects that such an action might have on the students, and even though\nhis own teams of physicians, psychiatrists, attorneys and psychologists had found no\nadverse affects from this procedure, fir. VI, 199-200).\nss The 1993Certification Team concluded that 90% of the non-obese students had\ngained weight or remained stable and concluded that theSpecialized Food program issafe\nand presents no medical risk. (0-75).\nIn response to the January 20, 1995 letter, JRC requested mediatior, and\narbitration under Paragraph B-2 of the Settlement Agreement. (U-169). There was no\nresponse tothe request until April 7, 1995, bywhich timethe Commissioner had already\ndecided tode,certifyJRC, rendering the response tothe April 7th letter meaningless. (U-\n179; U-182).\n139\n\nJRC's rate or whether DMR should set JRC's rate of reimbursement. (/RC-\n262). The Commissioner acknowledged at trial that he was aware that JRC's\nfinancial viability depends upon its rate of reimbursement. (Tr. 111,263-265).\nThe Commissioner admitted at trial that during the latter part of 1993, he and his\nstaff arranged to have a private \"pre-meeting\" at the DPS prior to DPS's\nupcoming public meeting with JRC on JRC's rate of reimbursement. (Tr. 111,\n263-271). The Commissioner admitted that the purpose of DMR's pre-meeting\nwith DPS was to convince DPS to relinquish control over JRC's reimbursement\nto DMR. frr. I11,263-71). The Commissioner testified that this type ofa pre-\nmeeting had never been sought with any other provider and, further, that the pre-\nmeeting with DPS was not permitted by the applicable regulations. (Tr. Ill, 263-\n271). The Commissioner also admitted that his staff could have discussed JRC's\nrate issues with the DPS at the public meeting regarding JRC. Cl'r. III, 268).\nThese efforts to gain control over JRC's finances were a part of a larger\nplan to force financial ruin upon JRC. Other events reflect efforts design_x: to\ndisrupt the financial operations of JRC including: assigning Dr. Cerreto the task\nof determining which of JRC's property was leased and what was owned;\nperforming title searches on JRC property; determining reasons why the DMH\nrate was higher than the DMR rate for JRC; and confirming the \"fiscal status\"\nof JRC, an assignment that was given to the Commissioner at the\nSeptember 7, 1993 Weekly Meeting. (Tr. X, 125; Tr. 111,214-215,223-224).\nThe Trial Court found that in past )'ears, negotiations for contracts tended\nto be purely ministerial tasks with no discussions regarding substantive issues of\nthe contract. There was evidence to support this fielding. (l\"r. XIIA, 24-26).\nThe Trial Court also found that during fiscal year 1994/1995, DMR changed its\nposition with respect to JRC and introduced into the contract negotiations matters\nwhich had been submitted to the Trial Court for resolution. There is evidence\nto support this finding, including the fact that DMR had attempted to coerce JRC\ninto accepting its determination of \"access\" issues which were raised in DMR's\ncounterclaim and, further, that DMR att._mpted to condition payment to JRC\nupon JRC's acceptance of the \"QUEST\" principles (JRC's group home survey\nby DMR), another matter in controversy in this case. (Tr. XI1A, 28-33). Even\n140\n\nthough the Commissioner does not identify which findings he contends are\nclearly erroneous, there was nonetheless ample evidence to permit the Trial Court\nto reject DMR's characterization of its contract efforts as \"well-intentioned.\"\nThe Commissioner challenges the Trial Court's conclusion that DMR\npurposely interfered with on-going Trial Court proceedings and attempted to\ndisrupt JRC's ability to retain its counsel. (Brief, p.146). The Trial Court's\nfindings were not clearly erroneous. At the meeting of the DPS Pricing\nCommittee on December 14, 1993, DMR officials took the position that JRC's\nlegal costs incurred in the action against DMR were \"non-reimbursable\" because\nJRC was \"engaged in litigation against the Commonwealth .... \" (JRC-262,\n34). This position was first taken by DMR three and a half months after JRC\nfiled its contempt claim. DMR was fully aware that if legal fees were non-\nreimbursable, JRC would have no way to compensate its counsel and would be\nforced to halt the litigation. When confronted on this matter, the Commissioner\nresponded that such a position would not compromise JRC's right of access to\nthe Trial Court, since the Trial Court could always award fees if JRC were\nsuccessful in its contempt claim. (Tr. IV, 28-29). The Commissioner was \"not\nable\" to answer the questions as to how JRC would pay its lawyers during the\ncourse of the litigation and on appeal, in the event that his argument had been\naccepted by the DPS. (Tr. IV, 28-29). 55\nOn June 30, 1995, the fifth day of trial, DMR sent a letter to JRC. The\nletter was mailed after the Commissioner had been subjected to vigorous\nexamination by JRC's counsel on June 28 and 29, 1995. (F. 257; JRC-267).\nDMR's communication of June 30, 1995, indicated that JRC was \"to cooperate\nwith and be responsive to\" an attached memorandum from the DPS. This DPS\nmemorandum (dated June 28, 1995, two days after trial began) found JRC's legal\nfees to be non-reimbursable. (JRC-267). On page 3 of the memorandum, the\n_5 In contrast, the Commissioner's privately retained counsel, Attorney Ferleger,\nwas not prepared to condition his receipt of fee.supon success in the case on an award\nfrom the Trial Court. Within one month after his effort topreclude JRC from paying its\ncounsel by requesting action from DPS, the Commissioner filed requests (which were\ngranted) with the Executive Office for Administration and Finance, increasing Attorney\nFerleger's contract from $73,000 to $118,000. (JRC-261; Tr. IV, 15).\n141\n\nAssistant Commissioner of DPS \"reiterated\" that \"public funds received through\na Massachusetts approved program price may not be used for non-reimbursable\noperating costs, including non-program expenses and litigation costs against the\nCommonwealth.\" (JRC-267). The letter also warned JRC that in the event these\nfunds were used for litigation purposes, they could be \"subject to recoupment.\"\n(JRC-267). Commissioner Campbell was compelled to admit when confronted\nwith this communication on July 5, 1995, that he was aware that such a\ncommunication would be sent. Cl'r. VI, 169-170). This letter placed JRC in the\nHobson's Choice of either terminating the litigation, or continuing with the\nlitigation with the understanding that any amounts paid to counsel were\nconsidered by DMR and DPS to be \"subject to recoupment.\"\nThe Commissioner inaccurately states that the letter oflune 30, 1995 was\nimproperly considered by the Trial Court because itwas admitted de ben_ subject\nto JRC's ability to offer testimony linking DMR to DPS's request for information\non JRC's legal expenses. (Brief, p. 144). The Commissioner falsely portrays the\nactual events. When the letter was first offered as an exhibit, the Trial Court\nasked whether counsel expected to offer testimony connecting DMR to the\ndecision by the DPS. fir. VI, 168). After counsel for JRC responded that there\nwas a connection (including the fact that the DPS memo was attached to DMR's\nletter), the Trial Court decided to \"accept this evidence subject to [DMR's]\nmotion to strike. _ fir. VI, 168). The Commissioner never made a motion to\nstrike and the evidence stood as admitted. Moreover, JRC was able to establish\nthe link between the DPS communication and actions of DMR when the\nCommissioner was compelled to admit that he was aware, prior to July 5, 1995,\nthat this communication would be sent to JRC. _\nss After a latercolloquy with Attorney Yogman, theTrial Court indicated thatthe\nevidence had been taken de bene. Nonetheless, the transcriptdoes not reveal thatthe\nTrial Court amended or altered its prior ruling that the evidence had been accepted\nsubject toa motion tostrike. Inany event, no efforts were undertakenby DMR tostrike\nJRC-267.\n142\n\n20. The Commissioner's failure to _rant a licen_;¢ tOJRC's\ngroup homes wa_ another attemDt to cause harm to JRC\n_n_Jclose the school\nThe Commissioner contends that the Trial Court made clearly erroneous\n\"adverse findings\" concerning DMR's \"QUEST\" results. (Brief, p.143). It is\ndifficult to respond to the Commissioner's argument since he does not identify\nwhich of the \"adverse QUEST findings\" were clearly erroneous. Many of the\nTrial Court's findings concerning QUEST are quoted directly from the QUEST\nsurvey itself.\nThe QUEST survey was dated December 20, 1994, but was not provided\nto JRC until March 15, 1995. (Tr. VilB, 30). As indicated by the QUEST\nProvider Certification Report (the \"QUEST Report\"), DMR gave JRC group\nhomes a \"non-certification.\" (U-164). On April 10, 1995, DMR notified JRC\nthat itfaced a non-certification if the deficiencies identified in the QUEST Report\nwere not corrected by the end of ninety days. (U-193). On May 23, I995,\nJRC's counsel requested in writing that DMR provide written confirmation that\nit would arbitrate with the Court Monitor, under the terms of the Settlement\nAgreement on QUEST. (JRC-283). DMR never agreed to arbitrate under\nParagraph B-2. Or. VIIB, 30-32).\nDMR attacks the finding as clearly erroneous on the grounds it creates\na false impression that all of the deficiencies as set forth in the QUEST survey\nare related to client dignity. The Commissioner cites footnote 65 of the Trial\nCourt's findings in support of this contention. Footnote 65 does not state that all\nof the deficiencies related to client dignity, but merely set forth examples of some\nof the deficiencies which the Trial Court found to be arbitrary and capricious and\nin ignorance of the severe ph)sical and mental deficiencies of JRC's client\npopulationY DMR also incorrectly represents to this Court that the \"only\ns7 For example, DMR citedJRC as deficient in the QUEST Report because it did\nnot provide its students with keys to their homes. (U-193, 5). Dr. Israel testified that\nmany of the clients inthe .IRe program would, due totheir disabilities, probably swallow\nthe house key if itwere given tothem. (Tr. VIIB, 34). Moreover, since the Trial Court\nhad before itsignificant evidence concerning the severe disabilities of the JRC students,\nit was entirely appropriate for the Trial Court to conclude that many of the QUEST\n143\n\nevidenceontheQUESTsurvey were the survey findings themselves.\" This\nstatement is not correct. The Court heard testimony from Dr. Israel concerning\nthe QUEST survey. Or. VIIB, pp. 29-38). The Court made no clearly\nerroneous findings with respect to the QUEST survey.\n21. JRC. its Students and Parents were harmed by the\nCommissioner's contemptuous and bad faith actions\nThe Commissioner characterizes as clearly erroneous at page 146 of his\nBrief the Trial Court's finding (F. 269-270) that the Commissioner's actions have\nfinancially devastated JRC and caused it to suffer loss of revenues of such\nmagnitude that its financial viability is in peril. The Commissioner also contends\nthat the Trial Court's findings concerning JRC's perilous financial situation are\nunsupported by the evidence. Prior to August of 1993, JRC had built a\nfinancially successful residential program with a reputation for successfully\ntreating the most severe and dangerous behavior disorders in the nation.\nfrr. VIIA, 50-53). After the settlement of the OFC controversy in 1987, IRC\nbuilt its program from an enrollment of forty-three students to an enrollment of\nsixty-six students in August of 1993. (Tr. VIII, 133). However, in August of\n1993, DMR began publishing to JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies a series\nof false and defamatory regulatory decisions which falsely depicted JRC as an\nunsafe program operating in chronic violation of the law and using painful\ntreatments on its clients which were not effective and not supported by\npsychology principles. DMR's regulatory decisions and other correspondence\npublished to JRC's Funding and Placement Agencies unjustifiably created the\nappearance of the ever-presant threat of imminent JRC decertification through its\nstream of false statements about JRC and by granting JRC only interim\ncertification.\nDr. Israel presented testimony to the Trial Court that, stagging in August\nof 1993, referrals of new students from JRC's largest client -- the state of New\nYork -- dropped dramatically, and an important placement agency in New York\nrequirements were arbitrary or capricious; for example, the requirement that a .IRC\nstudent should be placed on the board of directors of JRC.\n144\n\nCitydroppedallreferralstoJRCon two occasions, fir. VIIB, 57-58). As a\nresult, JRC's enrollment decreased from sixty-six students in August of 1993 to\nforty-three by the time of trial. (Tr. VIII, 170). The Trial Court also heard\nextensive testimony from JRC's accountant and financial adviser, Arthur Mullen,\na certified public accountant, concerning the economic damage to JRC's\nprogram. (Tr. VIII, 163).\nThe Commissioner argues that there was no financial damage to JRC\nbecause there was no evidence that JRC actually paid or \"ever intends to pay\"\nthe more than eight hundred thousand dollars of fees assertedly billed by its\ncounsel. (Brief, p. 147). The Trial Court found, however, that JRC would not\nhave survived had it not been for JRC's ability to have access to legal counsel\nin order to defend itself against the Commissioner's actions. (F. 286). In\naddition, Dr. Israel testified that JRC staff were laid off in order for JRC to pay\ncounsel, fir. VIIB, 54). There was no evidence to suggest that this matter was\nsimply handled oro bono. JRC submitted redacted portions of its legal bills to\nthe Commissioner's attorneys and an unredacted copy of the legal bills with the\nTrial Court for in camera inspection supporting the hours billed in representing\nJRC. DMR's argument that JRC could avoid its financial difficulties by simply\nnot paying its attorneys is frivolous. Certainly, Attorney Ferlerger was not\nwilling to work for DMR for free. The Trial Court's findings concerning the\nprecarious financial situation of JRC are well supported by the evidence.\nThis Court should also reject the Commissioner's argument that the Trial\nCourt's finding of harm to the students is clearly erroneous. The Trial Court\nheard extensive testimony regarding the harm to students which occurred after\nAugust 1993. As Dr. Israel testified, the program was cut, including cuts in\ndirect care, in order to meet attorney's fees incurred after July of 1993.\n(Tr. VIIB, 51-54). In fiscal year (MFY') 1994, DMR's wrongful conduct caused\nJRC to reduce its staff to thirty percent, as compared to FY 1993. By the end\nof FY 1995, JRC was again forced to reduce its staff by fifty percent from FY\n1993 in order to pay attorney's fees necessary to respond to DMR's wrongful\nconduct.\n145\n\nSeparataendaparftromthefinanciailmpact of fending off DMR and its\nlegion of regulators and attorneys, is the fact that JRC staff were essentially\npreoccupied during a large portion of 1993 to 1995 with responding to the\nregulatory actions of DMR. Within days at_er receipt of the August 6, 1993\nletter, ten to fifteen JRC staff members worked full-time over a three-week\nperiod gathering and organizing all the intbrmation ordered by the Commissioner\nas a condition of JRC keeping its twenty-five days of certification. (Tr. VIIA,\n36-37). Significant demands were placed upon JRC staff in responding to the\nRiveadell visit, the revision of the treatment plans, and visits by DMR\nemployees. Starting in late October 1994 and continuing through the end of the\nyear, JRC was besieged with literally hundreds of visits from DMR employees,\nincluding DMR psychologists reviewing treatment plans, DMR investigators,\nDMR service coordinators, DMR \"QUEST\" teams, DMR psychiatrists\nconducting psychiatric evaluations, and DMR attorneys reviewing records.\nfir. VIIB, 25-26). From August of 1993 to December of 1994, there were over\nfour hundred visits to JRC by DMR agents, attorneys and employees.\nfir. VIIA, 26-27). _8 The Trial Court heard testimony from a variety of\nwitnesses concerning the harm which had been visited upon JRC, JRC students,\nand JRC staffby DMR, including from Dr. Israel, Dr. Von Heyn, Dr. Worsham\nand Dr. Daignault. The Trial Court's findings are not clearly erroneous.\nThe Commissioner attacks as clearly erroneous the findings of the Trial\nCourt relative to JRC students W.M. and J.C. (F. 298). The Trial Court found\nthat DMR's refusal to allow JRC to continue the Specialized Food Program made\nJRC's program less effective in treating behavior disorders. The Trial Court\nheard testimony from Dr. Israel and Dr. Worsham that W.M. and I.C. were\ncurrently suffering an increase in their health-dangerous behaviors and additional\napplications of the GED as the result of being taken off the Specialized Food\nProgram when ordered terminated in the January 20 Letter.

See Johnson v. Mani_netti, 374\nMass. 784, 794 (1978). The Commissioner has not shown palpable error in\neither the Trial Court's choice of remedies for contempt of the Settlement\nAgreement, or in granting equitable relief in the form of a permanent injunction\nand receivership.\nThe Commissioner incorrectly argues that the Trial Court committed\nlegal error in ordering affirmative injunctive relief against a public official\nbecause it violates the separation of powers contained the in Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights, Article 30J ° This Court in the case of Perez v. Boston\nHousing, Authority, 379 Mass. 703 (1980), rejected the same argument made on\nbehalf of the public authority:\nThe Commissioner's argument, that the injunctive relief fails because the Trial\nCourt's twelve page order does notconform toMass. R. Cir. P. 65(d) since it, inter alia,\nrefers to the separate treatment plans and Settlement Agreement rather than repeating\nthose orders verbatim and does not set forth with specifically the actions DMR attorneys\nare enjoined from taking toavoidunethical conduct, is meritless.\n147\n\nIt is true that injunctions going against public officials.., and\nespecially injunctions that require the officials to take affirmative\nremedial steps, have been resisted on the [ ] grounds that they\nwould have the affect of cancelling the discretion or latitude of\naction supposed to be inherent in the offices held (i.e. -\nseparation of powers) and would present awkward or difficult\nproblems of enforcement. But it is now clear that such\ninjunctions are not prohibited for those reasons alone.\nld. at 739-730 (internal citations omitted). Here, permanent injunctive relief was\nwarranted based upon the Trial Court's conclusion supported by the record that\nfuture unlawful conduct by the Commissioner and DMR against JRC was likely\nto occur..See Cleary v. Commissi0ncr of Public Welfarg, 21 Mass. App. Ct.\n140, 150 (1985), c_it___gVe_elahn v. Guntner, 167 Mass. 92, 104 (1896)\n(Holmes, J. dissenting) Can injunction is not granted except with reference to\nwhat there is reason to expect in its absence\").\nSimilarly, the Commissioner's argument that a court should always\npresume that a public official will comply with a court order before issuing\naffirmative relief does not apply where the official has acted unlawfully:\nWhen a government official denies rights in contravention of a\ncourt order, the executive department intrudes upon the judicial\ndepartments's authority in violation of art. 30.... Where, the\nrecord shows that a public official or department of government\nhas violated a court order, ajudge is warranted in continuing it,\nperhaps even strengthening that order, to assure protection of the\nrights violated.\nHoffer v. Commil;sioner of Correction, 397 Mass. 152, 157 (1986) (internal\ncitations omitted); see also Blaney v. Commissioner of Corrections, 374 Mass.\n337,343 (1978). In other words, while the interest in preserving separation of\npowers may outweigh issuing an order in the first place, the balance shifts in\nfavor of the exercise of judicial power over the public official once there has\nbeen a violation of an existing court order. Indeed, it is within the inherent\njudicial function to order the executive branch to carry out its lawful obligations,\nand the failure of the executive branch to carry out judicial orders contravenes\nart. 30 \"by abrogating judicial decrees, an exclusively judicial function. _\nv. Commissioner of Corrections, 374 Mass. at 343 n. 4.\n148\n\nSimilarly, although courts normally must take care not to interfere with\nthe discretionary implementation of an agency's own regulations, N[w]hen an\nagency's implementation of its regulations violates the law, however, itisentirely\nappropriate for a court to order relief.\" Correia v. Dept. of Public Welfare. 414\nMass. 157, 163 (1993), _c_ Attorney General v. Sheriff of Suffolk County,\n394 Mass. 624, 631 (I.985); see also In The Matter Of M_;Knight, 406 Mass.\n787, 792 (1990). The usual deference to an agency's interpretation of its\nregulations or statutory duties does not extend to an unreasonable interpretation,\nand \"It]his Court has overridden agency interpretations where, for example, an\nagency is found to be acting in bad faith, or contrary to its statutory directive.\"\nCorreia v. Dept, of Public Welfare. 414 Mass. at 165. In the present case, the\nTrial Court was warranted in stripping the Commissioner and DMR of their\ndiscretionary statutory and regulatory authority over JRC because of the\nCommissioner's unlawful conduct and repeated violations of the Settlement\nAgreement.\nThe Commissioner also argues that the Trial Court should have limited\nthe scope of any relief granted for a violation of the Settlement Agreement,\nclaiming that this Court has previously ruled on the propriety of injunctive relief\nin regards to DMR's regulation of JRC in In The Matter Of MeKniitht, s_.\nThis Court did not reach the issue of a proper remedy for a violation of the\nSettlement Agreement. The Court, however, did expressly state that it was\nvacating the preliminary injunction in favor of BRI \"without prejudice to [JRC'sl\nright to pursue any violation of its rights under the settlement agreement on a\nproper complaint or motion [for contempt].\" 406 Mass. at 791. Implicit in the\nCourt's decision isthat an action for injunctive relief by JRC would properly lie\nagainst DMR if there had been a contempt claim for a violation of the Settlement\nAgreement. Furthermore, even though this Court vacated the preliminary\ninjunction on the grounds that DMR and not the Probate Court had the regulatory\ndiscretion to decide at which location the plaintiffstudent received treatment, this\nCourt also noted that injunctive relief against DMR would be proper if it had\nacted unlawfully in exercising its discretion: \"On the other hand, a court has the\ntight to order [DMRI to do what it has a legal obligation to do.\" ld. at 792.\n149\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Liacos expanded on the same\nlegal principles reviewed in the majority opinion, and took issue with the\ndeference accorded DMR's regulatory authority under the facts as contained in\nthe record from the hearing on the preliminary injunction:\nIt is true that judicial deference to the expertise of public\nagencies isa vital characteristic of our constitutional government,\none which invokes the principle of separation of powers\ncontained in art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\nThe tradition of judicial deference to agency decision making\nrepresents an important social policy decision that public\nagencies are generally in a better position than courts to make\nparticular technical decisions. However, this policy rests on an\nassumption that public agencies will act properly when making\ntheir decisions.\nWhere agencies have been shown to have acted improperly in the\nexecution of their regulatory, statutory, or constitutional duties,\nthis court has been willing to uphold the exercise of judicial\noversight of agency functions.\nThe rule that a court will not order an agency to act in a\nparticular way, unless there are no other methods by which the\nagency may fulfill its legal obligations is drawn directly from the\npolicy of judicial deference to agency expertise. This rule is not\nabsolute; it gives way in the face of agency misbehavior.\nld. at 807 (Liacos, C.J., dissenting) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the Chief\nJustice, applying the evidence of bad faith and misconduct by DMR to settled\nlegal principles, rejected the exact arguments the Commissioner raises here to\nattack the Trial Court.\nFurthermore, the Commissioner's reliance on Missouri v. Jenkins., 495\nU.S. 33 (1990), for the proposition that a court's equitable powers are limited\nin respect to state officials does not apply to the present case. The Court in\nJenkins was faced with review of an order issued by a Federal district court\ncompelling a local government to levy taxes in excess of limits set by the state\nstatute in order to finance a school desegregation plan. Although it upheld the\norder, the Court nevertheless was mindful of the concern for the Federal courts\nintruding on tho autonomy of state governments and interfering with local affairs\nstating, \"One of the most important considerations governing the exercise of\n[federal] equitable power is a proper respect for the integrity and function of\n150\n\nlocal governmental institutions.\" Id. at 51. Here, the Trial Court's equitable\npower to order relief against the Commissioner is not limited by a concern over\nstate's rights and concepts of federalism, and the warning set forth in Jenkins has\nno application to a review of the remedy provided by a state trial court in\nresponse to the unlawful conduct of a state official.\nThe Trial Court's decision to grant equitable relief in the form of a\nreceivership was also correct as a matter of law. \"It is beyond dispute that a\ncourt with equity jurisdiction has the power to appoint a receiver. Generally, the\nappointment of a receiver rests within the sound discretion of the court.\" Loaez\nv. Medford Community Center. Inc., 384 Mass. 163, 169 (1981) (citations\nomitted).\nIn Perez v. Boston Housing AuthQri_y, su_qp__,this Court held that a trial\ncourt has the inherent equitable power to appoint a receivership over the public\nagency, where the facts justify the need to effectuate the orders of the court\nthrough a third party acting as the court's arm, in instances of a:\n[Rlepeated or continuous failure of the officials to comply with\na previously issued decree, a reasonable forecast that the mere\ncontinued insistence by the Court that these officials perform the\ndecree would lead only to 'confrontation and delay' a lack of any\nleadership that could be expected to turn the situation around\nwithin a reasonable time.\n379 Mass. at 729-736. The Court in Perez, u_, also held that ordering a\npublic authority into receivership does not contravene art. 30:\nBut if it is a function of the judicial branch to provide remedies\nfor violations of law, including violations committed by the\nexecutive branch, then an injunction with that intent does not\nderogate from the separation principle, nor, by extension, does\na receivership otherwise properly instituted. To the contrary,\nwhen the executive persists in indifference to, or neglect or\ndisobedience of court orders, necessitating a receivership, it is\nthe executive that could more properly be charged with\ncontemning the separation principle.\nId. at 739-40; see also Blaney v. Commissioner of Correction, 374 Mass. at 342;\nAttorney General v. Sheriffof Suffolk County, 394 Mass. at 631.\nFaced with the Commissioner's broad abrogation of his legal duties under\nthe Settlement Agreement, his false statements to the Trial Court, and lack of\n151\n\nconcern for the welfare of the JRC students, the Trial Court here was warranted\nin exercising its legal authority and issuing a broad order which supplanted\ncompletely the executive functions of DMR as they related to JRC by appointing\na receiver to ensure compliance with the legal obligations under the Settlement\nAgreement. Se..__P_ercz, 379 Mass. at 733; see also Blaney v. Commis,si0_¢r 0f\n_, 374 Mass. at 342-43. This includes court control over the\nexpenditure of DMR funds regarding JRC once the Commissioner demonstrated\nhis continued unwillingness to comply with the Settlement Agreement: \"The\ninherent power of courts to enter orders concerning the expenditure of funds\nextends only to matters essential to the courts' functions, to the maintenance of\ntheir authority, and to their capacity to determine the rights of the parties.\"\nBradley v. Commissioner of Mental Health, 386 Mass. 363, 365 (1982). In\nBradley, supra, this Court struck down the broad order of the trial court\nsupplanting the executive branch function of the expenditure of funds only\nbecause, unlike in the present case, there was no showing in the record that\nDMH \"broadly abrogated its duties in the face of a judicial direction to fulfill\nthem.\" Id.._a_t.365. Implicit in this Court's decision in Bradle..y,however, is that\na trial court has the power to supplement any and all executive functions where,\n_s here, the record indicates the need for such sweeping relief.\nB. Affirmative Injunctive Relief And The Broad Powers Of The\nReceivership Are Warranted Under The Facts\nThe affirmative injunctive relief orders DMR and the Commissioner to\ncomply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Additional collateral relief\nof enjoining any retaliatory action against JRC by DMR and enjoining\ninterference with outstanding treatment orders is merely a restatement of specific\nrequirements or duties of DMR and the Commissioner. \"Courts have\ntraditionally issued orders and injunctions directing public officials to carry out\ntheir legal obligations.\" Attorney General v. Sheriff of Suffolk County, 394\nMass. ,_t631. The Trial Court was not in error to impose an affirmative order\nrequiring that DMR abide by the Settlement Agreement, particularly since the\nCommissioner had taken the position that he was not bound by the Settlement\n152\n\nAgreement and was clear thathe was intent on violating his obligations under the\nSettlement Agreement to d_troy JRC. See Heifer v. Commissioner of\nrr_, 397 Mass. at 156; _ Bradley v. Commissioner of Mental\n_, 386 Mass. at 366; In The Matter Of McKnight, 406 Mass. at 807\n(Liacos, C.J., dissenting)('[F]indings that the department acted in bad faith,\nknowingly misled the court, considered improper political motivations in making\nits decision, and failed to provide any competent clinical evidence to support its\nproposal.., certainly warranted a conclusion that the department had abandoned\nits proper role.').\nLikewise, the remedy of a receivership was well warranted on the facts\nof this case. The long-standing, contemptuous conduct of the Commissioner\ncoupled with the egregious harm being caused to the JRC students, made it\nimpossible for the Trial Court to risk giving the Commissioner any more time\nto terminate, or continue, his unlawful behavior. The Commissioner and DMR\ndemonstrate,! through a course of corrupt conduct and consistent, blatant\ndisregard of the Settlement Agreement that they were \"unable or unwilling\" to\ncomply with their legal obligations in undertaking the proper regulation of JRC.\nSee Br_adley v. Commissioner of Mental Health, 386 Mass. at 366; In The Matter\nOf Mcgnig._ht, 406 Mass. at 807 (Liacos, C.J., dissenting).\nThe combination of circumstances and facts justifies the appointment of\na receivership in this instance. The Trial Court found that the Commissioner and\nhis attorneys, in their regulation of JRC: violated his own Department's\nregulations; perpetrated a fraud upon the Trial Court; obstructed justice;\nintimidated and harassed Court officials; purposely disseminated knowingly false\ninformation for the purpose of destroying a spec!al education provider; used state\ninvestigators to conduct baseless investigations of Court officials; compromised\nthe independence of DMR's investigations unit; breached agreements made in the\nCourt's arbitration process; disseminated false statements about JRC to the\nnewspapers; used state funds, earmarked for the care and treatment of disabled\ncitizens, to rig a self-styled \"independent\" review of a special education school;\nused state funds to conduct unnecessary title searches; formulated and executed\na plan to disrupt the operations of a special education provider by every\n153\n\nconceivable means; arranged secret pre-meetings with other state agencies; made\ncritical regulatory decisions based upon a concern on how DMR might be\ndepicted on a television program; committed perjury; illegally used the attorney-\nclient privilege inan attempt to hide incriminating evidence from the Trial Court;\nmisused the legal process in an effort to drive up JRC's legal bills; and violated\nCourt orders in an effort to prevent the disclosure of \"smoking gun\" documents.\nThe Commissioner and DMR's conduct not only exceeds the \"malfeasance\" of\nthe agency as in Perez, su_.p.._,but it amounts to, as the Trial Court found,\npervasive public corruption. (App. 1310).\nWhile the authority of the receiver is broad, such authority is warranted\nto address the significant damage inflicted upon JRC and its students and to\nprevent further injury. This Court must view the specific powers of the receiver\nin light of the contempt and harm the Trial Court intended to remedy. The\nCommissioner attempted to put JRC out of business because of political and\nideological differences and concern over how he would be depicted ina television\nprogram. He came very close to succeeding. Based upon the litany of\nmisconduct of DMR, in addition to the fraud upon the Trial Curt, the corruption,\nand the disingenuous conduct of DMR's trial counsel, the Trial Court had no\nbasis to trust that DMR could responsibly exercise its obligations under the\nSettlement Agreement. As a result, the receiver has the full authority to\nadminister, manage, and operate DMR in all its relationships with JRC. Given\nthat the receivership was properly ordered, it is necessary that the receiver have\nthe proper authority to achieve his mandate. The Trial Court had the authority\nto provide the receiver with powers necessary to correct the problems for which\nthe receivership was created, which, in general, was DMR's attempts to regulate\nJRC out of business. See Snence v. Reeder, 382 Mass. 398, 413-419 (1981).\n('Judicial authority to enter implementing orders is inherent inthe equity powers\nof the courts.\").\nThe Trial Court's numerous references in its Judgment and Order to\nDMR's powers \"as they relate to JRC\" prove that the powers granted to the\nreceiver were tailored by the Trial Court to remedy the specific harm caused to\nJRC by DMR. In fact, the Trial Court, in ¶ 11 of its Judgment and Order,\n154\n\nmakesclearthatthereceivershiopf DMR is limited to JRC activities: \"DMR's\npowers, as they relate to JRC. its students and families, shall be totally\nsuperseded by the Receiver.\" (Emphasis supplied). (App. 1342). The\nremainder of the specific enumerated powers of the receiver fall under and are\nsubject to the catch-all provision in ¶ 11.\nThe Commissioner attempts to minimize the basis for a receivership,\narguing that the damage wrought by the Commissioner's actions has not reached\n\"crisis proportions.\" This assertion is categorically false, and it impermissibly\nignores the Trial Court's express findings of fact that the welfare of JRC clients\nwas profoundly affected by the actions of the Commissioner. (App. 1276-1286).\nMoreover, the devastation wrought to the JRC program can hardly be disputed.\nAfter successfully building up its enrollment following the last litigation in the\nmid-1980's, JRC's student enrollment has precipitously dropped by more than\nthirty percent since the summer of 1993, staffing has been cut by fitiy percent,\narid projected revenues have decreased by almost $3 million. (App. 1281, 1282,\nt285). Clearly, no private facility can indefinitely withstand the type of\nonslaught perpetrated by a state agency with unlimited resources that is bent upon\nachieving its illegitimate end.\nThe Commissioner's suggestion that the Trial Court's order supplants the\nauthority of the Department of the Attorney General to prosecute, defend, and\nsettle litigation on behalf of DMR is unsupported. The Department of the\nAttorney General, by illustration, possesses the authority to prosecute the instant\nlitigation on behalf of DMR. There is nothing in the Trial Court's order to\nindicate that the receiver could not under cert tin circumstances be represented\nby the Department of the Attorney General, even though such representation\nseems inconceivable at the present time in light of the Attorney General's\nrepresentation of the Commissioner.\nThe Commissioner also takes issue with the Trial Court granting the\nreceiver immunity from lawsuit. However, the receiver was already vested with\ninherent immunity an extension of the Trial Court itself. See ._..r._, 379 Mass.\nat 729-736. It is \"too well settled to require discussion, that every judge,\nwhether of a higher or lower court, is exempt from liability to an action for any\n155\n\njudgmenotr decision rendered in the exercise of jurisdiction vested in him by\nlaw.\" Commonwealth v. O'Neil, 418 Mass. 760, 766-767 (1994). See also\nPulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 519, 529 (1984). The receiver also has immunity\nas a quasi-judicial officer charged with implementing the Trial Court's Judgment\nand Order, and ultimately ensuring compliance with the Settlement Agreement.\nSe.._.Cgeommonweallh v, O'Neil, 418 Mass. at 767; se.._galso Lalonde v. Eissner,\n405 Mass. 207, 210 (1989). Such tasks are necessarily essential to the judicial\nfunction. See Commonwealth v. O'Neil, 418 Mass. at 767, and cases cited.\nIn short, the Commissioner attempts to create a nightmarish scenario\nwhereby an out-of-control receiver is busy disaffirming valid contracts _°,\nwrongfully firing DMR employees, and stripping independent state agencies of\ntheir authority to conduct abuse investigations. Not only is this a misstatement\nof the order, but there is no basis for assuming that the receiver will\nunreasonably exercise his authority. In addition, it is plain that the powers of the\nreceiver are all \"subject to future orders of this court \" If the receiver intends\nto take an action which the Commissioner believes is improper, the\nCommissioner may bring his concerns to the attention of the Trial Court which\nwould then have the authority to modify the receiver's powers. If the Trial\nCourt did not adequately address the matter, the Commissioner could then\npetition the Appeals Court. In fact, the Commissioner has already followed this\nroute in recently filing a petition for interlocutory relief to a Single Justice of the\nAppeals Court seeking relief from the Trial Court's orders concerning the\nsourcesofpaymentofthereceiver. (S.A. 82). The Commissioner's exaggerated\nconcerns in an attempt to scare this Court into reversing the judgment are\nunwarranted and unsupported.\n_o As the Trial Courtpoints out inits Order on Motion to Stay(App. 1432), DMR\nhas misquoted the text of the order concerning the execution ofeontracts. On page 158\nof his brief, the Commissioner states that the receiver has the power to unilaterally\n\"dis,affirm, reject or discontinue at any time any.., personal or professional services\nand material contracts;\" yet the Commissioner's counsel neglects tomention the end of\nthat sentence which continues, \"when he [the receiver] finds the perforn'mnce of such\ncontract or portion thereof will materially interfere with the achievement of the purposes\nof this order, or otherwise not be in the best interest of DMR.\"\n156\n\nC. This Court Should Not Stay the Judgment Or any Portion of the\nRelief Granted By The Trial Court Pending Resolution of the\nAppeal\n1. The Commissioner cannot show an abuse of discretion\nin the denial of a stay nendin_ appeal\nThis Court directed the Commissioner, if he so chose, to renew his\napplication for a stay pending appeal in his brief on the merits of the contempt\njudgment, as set forth in Commissioner of Mental Retardation v. Judge\nR0tenberg Educational Center, Inc,, 421 Mass. 1010, 1010 (1996). The\ndirection to renew the motion for stay inthe brief on the underlying appeal could\nbe construed as an instruction to the Commissioner to consolidate an appeal from\nthe denial of relief by the Single Justice, which was the subject of the above-cited\ndecision, with the appeal on the merits. See Packaging Industries Group, Inc.\n_, 380 Mass. 609, 614 (1980) (appeal from denial of stay pending\nappeal must be consolidated with appeal from denial of preliminary injunction).\nThis is even more likely in light of the fact that the Trial Court judge who heard\nthe case, a single justice of the Appeals Court, a single justice of this Court, and\nthe full panel on appeal pursuant to SJC Rule 2:21, all denied a stay pending\nappeal. It seems unlikely that this Court would give the Commissioner a fifth\nbite at the apple and allow him to advance de novo a motion for stay pending\nappeal.\nThus, the Commissioner's renewal of a request for a stay should be\ntreated as an appeal from the order of a single justice of this Court (Lynch, J.)\nentered pursuant to G. L. c. 211, §3. The Commissioner must either prove that\nthe Single Justice abused his discretion in denying a stay pending appeal, or\nabused his discretion in denying extraordinary relief from the orders of the Trial\nJudge and Appeals Court Single Justice. See Healy v. First District Court of\nBristol, 367 Mass. 909, 910 (1975); Cefalu v. Globe Newspaper Co., 377 Mass.\n907,907 (1979); Spence v. Reeder, 382 Mass. at 422 (issuance or denial of stay\npending appeal is discretionary). In either case, the Commissioner has made no\nshowing that the Single Justice committed an abuse of discretion. The\nCommissioner's request that this Court review the above record de novo and\n157\n\ngrantastayisnotthecorrecsttandarda,ndthe Commissioner cannot meet his\nburden of showing palpable error by the Single Justice.\n2. The Commissioner does not meet the criteria for a stay\npending appeal\nA party seeking a stay of an order granting an injunction or appointing\na receiver pending appeal has the burden of proving the following four criteria:\n(l) a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits of\nthe appeal; (2) a showing that unless a stay is granted he will\nsuffer irreparable injury; (3) a showing that no substantial harm\nwill come to other interested parties and (4) a showing that a\nstay will do no harm to the public interest.\nMartinez Rodriguez v. Jimenez, 537 F.2d 1, 2 (lst Cir. 1976); s_ also Hilton\nv. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776-777 (1987). _t The same standards apply to\na stay of a judgment of civil contempt. See Patterson v. Lumbard, 16 F.R.D.\n140, 140-141 (S.D.N.Y. 1954), _ In Re Manufacturers Trading Corp., 194\nF.2d 948, 957 (6th Cir. 1954).\nAn applicant for a stay bears a heavy burden: \"The judgment of the\nCourt below is presumed to be valid, and absent unusual circumstances we defer\nto the decision of that Court not to stay its judgment.\" Craddick v. N.H,\nNewman, 453 U.S. 928, 933 (1981), quotin_ from Wise v. Linscomb, 434 U.S.\n1329, 1333-1334 (1976). Moreover, the applicant's already heavy burden is\neven greater where, as here, a stay has already been denied in the lower court:\n\"[Wlhen a party seeking a stay makes application to an appellate judge following\nthe denial of a similar motion by a trial judge, the burden of persuasion on the\nmoving party is substantially greater than it was before the trial judge.\"\nv. Robertson, 432 F.2d 977, 979 (4th Cir. 1970) (citations omitted). The trial\ncourt's decision not to grant a stay in an action for an injunction or in a\nreceivership is afforded such great deference that an appeal from the denial of\n_ There appears tobe no Massachusetts case law on the standard for granting a\nstay.

The Trial Court's\nvoluminous findings are amply supported by the trial record. The record\nlikewise supports the Trial Court's ultimate conclusion of contetr_pt by the\nCommissioner, and also supports that the remedies were well within the Trial\nCourt's discretion to ensure compliance within the Settlement Agreement. DMR\ncannot meet its heavy burden of proving a stay pending appeal of either the order\nof contempt or the remedies granted.\nDMR will simply continue to engage in its regulatory _war of attrition\"\nif this Court grants a stay. _ Indeed, the fact that the Commissioner believes\nthat he has done nothing inconsistent with his regulatory authority despite the\nexpress findings of bad faith, fraud and corruption shows that the Commissioner\nis likely to continue with the egregious conduct, if the judgment and relief is\nstayed pending appeal. The fact that the Trial Court saw the need in its\nJudgment and Order to expressly order the Commissioner and DMR to refrain\nfrom retaliation against .IRC is indicative of the continuing threat posed to JRC\nand the students. (App. 1341). The Trial Court found that the parents of JRC\nstudents would be \"faced with a genuine concern for [their children's] very\nsurvival.\" (App. 1437). This conclusion is more than amply supported by the\nrecord\nIn a complete mischaracterization of the Trial Court's order, the\nCommissioner makes a number of inaccurate and exaggerated representations in\nhis Brief concerning the power of the receiver to bolster his argument that a stay\npending appeal is warranted. The receiver is not, for example, \"directed to\n_: The TrialCourt concluded indenying a stay of thejudgment that therewas more\nthansufficient evidence in the case toindicate that JRC, the students and their parents\nv..ouldbeimmediately and irreparably harmedduring thependency ofthisappeal if aslay\n•.,.'eregranted. (App. 1457).\n159\n\nensurethatanti-lRCbias iseliminated.\" (Brief, p.161). Rather, the receiver is\nrequired to use his best efforts to ensure that this bias iseliminated. The purpose\nof this directive is that it is contemplated that the receivership will ultimately be\nterminated and that DMR will again regulate JRC in compliance with the 1987\nSettlement Agreement. In short, there is no \"ideological purge\" a.s the\nCommissioner asserts. In addition, the receiver's authority over DMR personnel\nis limited by the fact that the receivership extends _ to DMR's regulation of\nJRC. (App. 1342). Since DMR personnel are available to the receiver to assist\nhim in his regulation of JRC, the receiver must have the corollary power to\nreassign those individuals from their JRC-related duties. This power, however,\ndoes not mean that the receiver has the ability to discharge at will DMR\nemployees from employment at DMR.\nThe mischaracterization of the receiver's power continues at page 162 of\nthe Commissioner's Brief. There, he argues that the Trial Court's order\n\"supplants* the authority of the Disabled Persons Protection Commission (DPPC)\nto conduct investigations. The order contains no such authority, but simply\ndirects the receiver to oversee DMR's investigations unit with respect to JRC.\n(App. 1346). The plain basis for this provision is that DMR was found by the\nTrial Court to have misused its investigations unit as part of its overall strategy\nto destroy the JRC program. (App. 1259-60). Indeed, DMR's supposedly\n\"independent\" investigations unit was utilized by the Commissioner to conduct\nan unwarranted investigation of the Guardian Ad Litem. (App. 1262-63).\nThere isno basis for the determination, as asserted by the Commissioner\nin his Brief at page 161, that absent a stay, students will be harmed or injured\nas a result of DMR's inability to conduct investigations of abuse or neglect, or\nto ensure that aversive procedures are used pursuant to behavior modification\nregulations. Rather, it is simply the case that the regulatory functions will be\nundertaken by the receiver, and any treatment plan authorizing aversive\nprocedures is permitted only after the entry of a substituted judgment order. If\nJRC uses aversive procedures improperly, then counsel for the students, the\nGuardian Ad Litem, the Court Monitor or the receiver is free to bring such\nmatters to the attention of the Trial Court.\n160\n\nTIlE COURT DID NOT ERR IN TIlE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEY'S\nVl\nFEES ASSESSED AGAINST Tile COMMISSIONER\nA. The Attorney's Fee Award As Decided By The Trial Court Is\nReasonable And Supported By The Record\nIt is well settled that the amount of an award of reasonable attorney's fees\nin all actions, including an action for contempt, is presumed to be correct, and\nwill not be reversed on appeal absent a showing that the trial court's findings are\nclearly erroneous. See Olmstead v. Murphy, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 664, 665\n(1986)(citations omitted); see also Kennedy v. Kennedy, 400 Mass. 272, 274\n(1987). As the court stated in Fontalne v. Ebte¢ Corp., \"The amount of a\nreasonable attorney's fee, . .. is largely discretionary with the judge, who is in\nthe best position to determine how much time was reasonably spent on a case,\nand the fair value of the attorney's services.\" 415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993); see\nalso Stowe v. Bologna, 417 Mass. 199, 203 (1994).\nThis Court has followed federal fee a:,'ard decisions in deciding that the\nbasic measure of a reasonable fee award consists of a calculation based on a\nmultiplication of the fair market rates by the reasonable time spent. See Stratos\nv. Denartment of Public Welfare, 387 Mass. 312, 322 (1982), _ on\nJohnson v. Georeia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974); see\nalso Torres v. Attorney General, 391 Mass. 1, 16 (1984); Society of Jesus of\nNew England v. Boston Landmarks Commission, 411 Mass. 754, 759 (1992);\nFontaine v. Ebtec Corp., 415 /',lass. at 326; Stowe v. Bologna, 417 Mass. at\n203. This calculation \"provides an objective basis on which to make an initial\nestimate of the value of the lawyer's services.\" Hensle¥ v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S.\n426, 437 (1983).\nThe Commissioner's assertion that counsel for JRC provided no evidence\non which the Trial Court could determine the fee award is not correct. The\njudge expressly stated that the award was based on two sources: nThis Court has\nreviewed the affidavits submitted by counsel for JRC . . . [and] has reviewed in\ncamera, time slips and other documentation submitted to support their affidavits.\"\n(App. 1341). The extensive affidavits from counsel for JRC set forth each\nattorney's normal hourly rate, years of legal experience and education, and the\n161\n\ntotal hoursexpendedon the litigation all related to tile Commissioner's\ncontemptuous conduct commencing in 1993, which was buttressed by the actual\nunredacted bills of JRC counsel. See Stratos, _ at 323. Counsel for JRC\nprovided the Trial Court with ample evidence to determine the objective worth\nof the services of the JRC attorneys in regards to this litigation.\nFirst, the Trial Court was warranted in determining that the flat fee of\n$175 per hour was reasonable. The bulk of the work, as detailed in the\ndocumentation supplied by JRC counsel to the Trial Court, was performed by\nsenior litigation associate, Michael Flammia, Esq., and senior litigation partners,\nRoderick MacLeish, Jr., Esq. and Robert Sherman, Esq., whose normal hourly\nrates according to the affidavits averaged between $160 per hour and $270 per\nhour. (App. 587). The hourly rate of $175, therefore, was actually a reduced\nrate. Moreover, the Trial Court was warranted in finding that $175 per hour was\nreasonable in light of the experience of these attorneys. _ For example,\nAttorney MacLeish and Attorney Sherman have a long history of representing\nJRC and the JRC Students and Parents in their relationships with the state\nagencies dating back to the 1985/1986 controversy, and were architects of the\nSettlement Agreement. (App. 133). Also, $175 per hour was reasonable in light\nof the fact that the JRC litigation consumed the bulk of the time of JRC counsel\nfor months at a time from 1993 through the trial in 1995, thereby limiting the\namount of time counsel could devote to other clients. See Stratos, _u_, at 323.\nAlthough the Commissioner nitpicks at the rates charged for \"routine\" tasks, .'he\nTrial Court was not required to apply different hourly rates to the various tasks\nperformed by each individual attorney. See Handy v. Penal Institutions\nCommissioner of Boston, 412 Mass. 759, 767 (1992).\nSecond, the Trial Court was also warranted in determining that the total\ntime expended by counsel chargeable to JRC, as documented in the affidavits and\ncopies of the unredacted legal bills, was reasonable in light of the difficulty of\nthe case and results obtained. Se..__Scteratos, _ at 323. The Trial Court\no DMR's prior counsel inthis case, David Ferleger, has received fee awards of\nas high as $250/hour in other similar contempt cases in other jurisdictions. See\nHelderman v. Pennhurst School & Hosp., 899 F.Supp. 209, 214 (E.D. Pa. 1995).\n162\n\nexpressly found that all of the legal work performed on behalf of JRC between\n1993 through 1995 in response to both regulatory matters and litigation matters\nwas directly related to the Commissioner's bad faith regulatory activity\ncommencing with his letter of August 3, 1993: \"The fees were spent as a direct\nresult of the Defendant's contemptuous conduct over the last two years.\"\n(App. 1341). The Trial Court also found that the amount of hours expended by\nJRC counsel was reasonable in light of the constant bombardment of regulatory\nedicts and litigation effected by the Commissioner against JRC:\nThis Court finds that the enormous expenditure of legal\nresources by DMR in its contemptuous attack on JRC more than\njustifies the legal commitment JRC was obligated to make to\nrepel these efforts, The Commissioner himself testified that he\nauthorized an inordinate and unusual amount of legal resources\nto be devoted to the pursuit of JRC.\n(App. 1315).\nIn fact, the Trial Court in its Findings of Fact found that JRC was forced\nto spend so much on attorneys fees to respond to the constant regulatory barrage\nfrom 1993 to 1995 that the costs drained program resources causing JRC to cut\nback on staff, including direct-care staff. (App. 1281). Indeed, the litigation\nwas so overwhelming right before trial in 1995 that counsel for JRC was forced\nto recruit the aid of two associates from the Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott's\nWashington office to respond to the filings of the Commissioner. (App. 563).\nDespite facing this constant war of attrition by the Commissioner for over two\nyears, JRC counsel was able to stave off the closure of JRC, force the\nCommissioner to comply with his legal obligations, and expose the corruption of\na high ranking public official within a state agency. See Stratos, _ at 323\n(results obtained and benefit to public interest considered in fee award).\nThe findings regarding the fee award also show that the Trial Court\nexercised its discretion and independent judgment in determining the reasonable\nfee award:\nThe amounts sought by the parties as reimbursement for the\nattorney's fees they have been forced to expend as a result of the\nDefendant's conduct over the last two years is fair and\nreasonable. The court makes this finding, incorporating the\naffidavits of the above mentioned parties based on the attorney's\n163\n\nyears at the bar, standing in the legal community, the caliber of\ntheir work in this case, the difficulty of the matter, and the fact\nthat there was minimal duplication of effort.\n(App. 1314, 1341). The Trial Court did not merely accept the rates and time\ndocumented by JRC counsel. Rather, the record supports that the Trial Court\ndetermined that counsel for JRC demonstrated \"billing judgment\" and did not\ninclude in the fee request any hours for time expended that was excessive,\nredundant, or otherwise \"not properly billed to one's client.\" _, 461 U.S.\nat 434, auotin_ from Copeland v. Marshall. 641 F.2d 889, 891 (D.C. Cir.\n1980); see also H_Ka.._, 412 Mass. at 766-767.\nFurthermore, not only did the Trial Court have the opportunity to\nobserve the abilities of counsel throughout the trial, the Trial Court was\nintimately involved with the entire litigation from its inception in 1993 and had\nfirst hand knowledge of the litigious conduct of the Commissioner and the able\nresponse of JRC counsel. See Fontaino v. Ebtec Colo.. 415 Mass. at 324; see\nalso Olmstead v. Murphy, 29 Mass. App. Ct. at 665. (\"A judge's firsthand\nknowledge of the work performed.., is a weighty factor.\"). The Trial Court\nwas not obliged to identify and justify each hour or \"announce what hours [were]\npermitted for each legal task.\" New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air v. Espanola\nMercantile Co.. Inc.. 72 F.3d 830, 834 (10th Cir. 1996), auotin_ from Mar_\nv. Credit Bureau of Raton, 801 F.2d 1197, 1202 (10th Cir. 1986). The Trial\nCourt in its order articulated clearly and concisely that the fee award was\nreasonable and based upon the entire record and circumstances of the litigation.\nSee Hensle£, su_, at 437; see also New Mexico Citizens., suora, 834; H.._,\nsups, at 766-767. There was no error. _\nThe Commissioner contends thatthiscourt should automaticallyreverse thetrial\njudge's awardof attorney's fees on the grounds that there are no express findings as to\nthe reasonablenessof the fee, citing Strand v. Herrick & Smith, 396 Mass. 783 (1986).\nThis statement isnotcorrect. Since the Trial Courtconcisely articulated the basis for its\naward inthisinstance (App. 1314, 1341), Strand, supra, hasnoapplication tothe present\ncase. Furthermore, the reliance on Stran..._sdu,pra, is misplaced since the Courtthere was\nreviewing the award of attorney's fees tothe defendant pursuant toG. L. c. 231, §6(0,\napplicable to fees for frivolous lawsuits, which statute expressly requires the judge to\ninclude in hisorder \"specific facts and reasons\" for his findings, as well as \"the method\n7:ywhich the amount of award was computed.\"\n164\n\nThesubmissionosf the Commissioner's counsel in his own request for\nattorney's fees undercuts and contradicts all of the Commissioner's arguments\nagainst IRC's fee award. First, the argument that JRC attorneys should not be\nreimbursed for any of their work dating back to 1993 ignores the Trial Court's\nfinding that the Commissioner's contemptuous conduct started in August of 1993\nand continued through the trial, and contradicts that the Commissioner's attorneys\nas well request in their affidavits reimbursement for this entire time period.\n(App. 1153-1170). The Commissioner also claims that JRC's having a total of\neight attorneys (not 18 and 25 as he incorrectly states in his Brief) working on\nthe case was not reasonable. The Commissioner himself had at least nine\nattorneys who filed affidavits attesting that they had worked on the litigation on\nhis behalf. (App. 1153-1172). The Commissioner also ignores that the bulk of\nthe legal work on behalf of JRC was actually performed by three attorneys.\n(App. 563). It is no coincidence that the amount of documented time and\nexpenses spent by the Commissioner's attorneys on the contempt litigation only\nwas equal to the amount of time and expenses spent by JRC's lawyers on both\nthe contempt action and in responding to the Commissioner's regulatory activity.\nIn fact, the Trial Court found that counsel for the Commissioner had\nmisrepresented the extent of DMR's constant litigation of this case: \"The\naffidavits filed by Assistant Attorney General Yogman, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Wall, and Deputy General Chow-Menzer understate the expenditure of\nthe legal and financial resources by DMR.\" (App. 1315). Moreover, the Trial\nCourt also found that the number of attorneys devoted to the JRC litigation was\nreasonable in light of the constant bombardment of litigation effected by the\nCommissioner. See Statsny v. Southern Bell Teleohone & Telel_raoh CO,, 77\nF.R.D. 662,663-64 (W.D.N.C. 1978) (legal work of opposing counsel relevant\nto reasonableness of fee award).\nThe Commissioner also criticizes the role of counsel for the Plaintiff\nclass and counsel for the student members of the class, calling into question their\nnecessity and right to compensation. However, the Commissioner conveniently\nignores that he supported the motion brought by a group of intervenors that\nwould have tripled the amount of attorneys representing the JRC students. This\n165\n\ncontradicttshecurrenpt ositionoftheCommissionethratcounsefol rthestudents\nandclasswerenotnecessarayndmerelyalongfortheride.\nB. TheTrialCourt Did Not Err In Denying Review Of Counsel's\nC0ntcmooraneous Time Records\nAs discussed, counsel for JRC filed and served the Commissioner with\nlengthy affidavits setting forth in detail all of their legal work performed on\nbehalf of JRC based on a review of contemporaneous time records• This Court\nhas approved, and even suggested, the use of affidavits to prove fee awards: \"In\nthe interest of economy of time and expense, the litigants may agree to offer..\n• affidavits as to this issue, perhaps including, with the approval of the judge,\naffidavits of the counsel of record•\" Stratos, 387 glass, at 323 n.10; see also\nStow e, 417 Mass. at 201 n. 3 (plaintiffs submissions for attorney's fee included\n18affidavits, including affidavits of counsel); Torres, 391 glass, at 15 (claim for\nattorney's fees presented on affidavits of three counsel who worked on behalf of\nplaintiff).\nLikewise in Hand',/v. Penal Institutions Commissioner of Boston, suora,\nthis Court rejected objections regarding a fee application by the defendants\nsimilar to those raised by the Commissioner. There, the Court held that an\naffidavit of one counsel for the plaintiff attesting to the fact that the compilation\nof time devoted to the case by attorneys in his firm was based upon a review of\ncontemporaneous lime records was a proper basis for assessing a reasonable fee\naward. 412 glass, at 768. The Court, reviewing federal decisions, rejected the\nargument that the fee award was latently improper because the actual time\nrecords were not produced for the court: \"It is not the law that a request for\nattorney's fees must be entirely denied when a fee applicant does not submit\ncontemporaneous time records to the court.\" ld._._a,t 767. Therefore, the\naffidavits filed by counsel for JRC are not, as the Commissioner contends,\n\"patently insufficient\" to support the fee award in this case. See also Jean v.\nNelson, 863 F.2d 759, 772 (llth Cir. 1988), afm'd, sub. nora. Commissioner,\nINS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154 (1990) ('contemporaneous time records are not\nindispensable where there is other reliable evidence to support a claim for\n166\n\nattorney'sfees\").ContrasWt einberger v. Great N. Nekoosa Corp,, 925 F.2d\n518, 527 (lst Cir. 1991) (\"application was bereft of contemporaneous time\nrecords or any other suitable documentation\").\nIndeed, the Commissioner himsdf made an application for attorney's fees\non his counterclaim, knowing that his own counsel did not keep contemporaneous\ntime records. The Commissioner's counsel could only provide sketchy affidavits\nbroadly outlining the total hours spent on the case without any additional support.\n(App. 1153-1172). It is wholly inconsistent for the Commissioner to claim that\naffidavits do not provide a proper means for determining a fee when his own\napplication was based solely on aft]davits. (S.A. 74). The Commissioner makes\nno showing as to why his review of the unredacted bills of JRC counsel was\nrequired.\nIt is the Trial Court, not the Commissioner, which had the duty of\nassessing the reasonableness of the fee. The quotation by Chief Justice Berger\nin his concurring opinion in Hensley v. Eckerhar_, _ cited by the\nCommissioner in his Brief at page 171 does not relate whatsoever to providing\nan adversary with the time records in a fee application. Rather, the quotation\nwas merely a recitation of the Chief Justice's view on what materials he believed\nshould be presented to a court for basing its initial estimate of the value of a\nlawyer's services. The Commissioner omits the continuation of the quote:\nAs a result, the party who seeks payment must keep records in\nsufficient detail that a neutral judge can make a fair €_valuation\nof the time expended, the nature and need for the service, and\nthe reasonable fees to be allowed.\n461 U.S. at 441 (emphasis added). The other cases relied upon by the\nCommissioner likewise do not speak to an opposing party's right to review the\ntime sheets or billing records of a party claiming attorney's fees in situations\ncomparable to this ease. Moreover, since this Court has expressly held that a\nparty is not mandated to submit contemporaneous time records to the court in\norder to obtain a fee award, see Hand_, _ at 767-68, it is illogical that an\nopponent would have an absolute right to access time records.\nFinally, the Commissioner contends that the Trial Court erred in\nengaging in an in camera inspection of the records and subsequently issuing an\n167\n\norderimpoundintghecontemporaneotiumserecordsofJRCcounsel.TheTrial\nCourtdeterminetdhatanincamerareviewofthetimerecordswas\"necessary\nandappropriatein orderto inspectandconsiderthe confidentiablilling\ninformationunderthecircumstanceosf this litigationwhereattorney-client\nprivilegeapplies.\"(App.1201).Thedecisiontoreviewthebills,i_.cnamera, in\norder to preserve the attorney-client privileged material is consistent with\nholdings by other courts in similar situations. See Licensing Corp. of America\nv. National Hockey League Player's Association, 580 N.Y.S.2d 128, 129 (1992);\nsee also Federal Trade Commissioner v. Cambridge Exchange Ltd., Inc,, 845 F.\nSupp. 872, 874 (S.D. Fla. 1993) (information regarding attorney's fees is\nprivileged if itwould reveal other privileged information such as trial strategy or\nthe nature of legal services performed); Gonzales Tresno v. Wella. 774 F. Supp.\n688, 690 (D. P.R. 1991) (\"courts have routinely rejected demands to reduce bills\nfor legal services that reveal the nature of the work performed\").\nIn fact, in the case of Real v. Continental Grou Ip..,J_0_., 116 F.R.D. 211\n(N.D. Cal. 1986), the court, faced with an almost identical request as here,\ndenied the plaintift's attorney the ability to review itemized bills of counsel for\nthe defendant which ',,,'ere sought for the purpose of proving the reasonableness\nof the plaintift's demand lot\" attorney's fees following a successfid employment\ndiscrimination case. Id.._a.t 213. There, the court held that, the actual itemized\nbills for legal services performed on behalf of the defendant were privileged and\nnot available for inspection because of the attorney-client information contained\nin the narratives of such bills, although information regarding the number of\nhours billed and total fees paid was not protected. Id.__a_t.214-15.\nIn the present case, the narrative portion of the unredacted legal bills of\ncounsel for JRC were highly detailed and, if divulged to counsel for the defense,\nwould provide insight into legal strategy, the work product of counsel, and\ncommunications between lawyer and client. (App. 1201). JRC properly\ndivulged adequate information regarding the numbers of hours billed and the total\namount of the fee charged through the detailed affidavits compiled upon a review\nof the bills, as well as supplying copies of the redacted version of the bills\nomitting the narrative portion.\n168\n\nOnce the Trial Court determined that the unredacted bills should he\nreviewed in camera, it was necessary for the Trial Court to impound the bills,\notherwise the purpose of the in _ inspection to preserve the attorney-client\nprivilege would have been frustrated. Even though the Uniform Rules of\nImpoundment Procedure were in effect, the Trial Court had the inherent power\nto enter an order sun .S.p..Q.Q_i,mpounding the documents contained in its files.\nSee Newspaper of New England v. Clerk Magistrate of the Ware Division of the\nDistrict Court, 403 Mass. 628, 631-633 0988) s_ so_ order of\nimpoundment upheld despite application of Uniform Rules). Itiswell-settled that\na trial court has the inherent power \"to impound its files in a case and deny\npublic inspection of them when justice so requires.\" George W. Prescott\nPublishing Co. v. Register of Probate of Norfolk County, 395 Mass. 274, 277\n(1985), _ from Sanford v. Boston Herald-Traveller Corn,, 318 Mass, 156,\n158 (1945); see also O'Harvey Newspapers. Inc. v. Apoeals C0urL 379 Mass.\n539, 546 (1977) (impoundment within sound discretion of trial judge). In\nNewspaper of New England, s_.0.p._,this Court held that a judge must determine\nwhether good cause exists to order impoundment, and must tailor the scope of\nthe order so that it does not exceed the need for impoundment. Id. at 631-633\n(citations omitted).\nThe Trial Court's order of impoundment in this case was narrowly\ntailored to achieve the express goal of protecting the confidential attorney-client\nprivileged material in the contemporaneous time records. Of the more than 400\nexhibits submitted during the trial, the Trial Court ordered a mere six of those\nexhibits impounded. The Trial Court's narrowly tailored order is reasonable in\nlight of the information sought to be protected, and in light of the circumstances\nof this case, in accordance with Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure.\nMoreover, the Commissioner has shown no compelling need for the\nunredacted bills which outweighs the necessity for impounding such bills to\nprotect the attorney-client privilege. See Newspaper of New England, 403 Mass.\nat 631-633. His only purported need for a review of the bills is to attack the\nreasonableness of the fee award on appeal. However, the Trial Court's clear and\nconcise basis for the award as articulated in the Judgment and Order as well as\n169\n\nthe materials submitted by JRC to the Commissioner, provide the Commissioner\nwith an adequate basis for challenging the reasonableness of the award without\nrequiring the need to challenge specific entries in the bills. _ Cf. Bell v. United\nPrinceton Properties. Inc., 884 F.2d 713, 719-20 (3rd Cir. 1989) (party\nchallenging fee award need not point to each individual excessive entry).\nThe Commissioner has not attempted to explain why the total amount of\ntime JRC's attorneys spent responding to his unlawful regulatory actions and\nprosecuting the contempt action should be less than the total time spent by the\nCommissioner's eight attorneys on the litigation only. In addition, it is difficult\nto understand how the Commissioner can claim an overwhelming dire necessity\nfor the unredacted bills when he himself applied for a fee award without ever\nrequiring his own counsel to maintain contemporaneous time records. Finally,\nthe impounded exhibits are always available for this Court's review, if it deems\nthem necessary, pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 9('0) and 18(a). See also Iverson\nv. Board of Anneals of Dedham, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 951,951 (1982). There is\nno prejudice and no reason to vacate any part of the attorney's fee award as\nordered by the Trial Court in response to the Commissioner's contemptuous and\ncorrupt course of conduct since August 6, 1993.\nIn fact, despite having all of this material at his disposal, the Commissioner\nnever made any challenge in the Trial Court to any portion of the fee award as being\nunreasonable. Federal courts have deemed any ground attacking the r_nableness of\na fee award not raised in the district court in the first instance to be waived and\nunavailable as a grounds for attacking the award on appeal. See New Mexico Citizens,\n72 F.3d at 835 n. 3. Contrary to the implication of the assertion in footnote 238 of his\nBrief, the Commissioner never challenged the reasonableness of any of portion of the fee\naward in his response to the Second Post-Trial Order of the Trial Court, but rather\nchallenged only the validity of JRC's decision not to make time sheets available for\ninspection. (S.A. 74). Even following the trial, the Commissioner moved to lift the\nimpoundment orderbut never attackedthe reasonableness of anyportionof the fee award\nor requested the Trial Court to reduce the award.\n170\n\nVI. Tills COURT SHOULD AWARD JRC ITS APPELLATE\nATTORNEY'S FEES FOR tlAVING TO DEFEND THIS\nFRIVOLOUS APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER OF\nCONTEMPT\nJRC requests this Court to impose double costs and attorney's fees on the\nCommissioner, DMR, and their counsel pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 25 and\nG. L. c. 211, § 10, for having to respond to this frivolous appeal. See_\nv. Steele, 414 Mass. 450, 45 (1993); Symmons v. O'Keefe, 419 Mass. 288, 303\n(1995). \"An appeal is frivolous when the law is well settled [and] when there\ncan be no reasonable expectation of a reversal.\" _, 419 Mass. at 303\n(internal quotations and citations omitted). The Commissioner asserts at page 56\nof his Brief that this appeal raises \"novel and complex\" issues regarding the\nrelationship between DMR's regulatory authority and the power of the Trial\nCourt. This is not the case. This case only involves an express order of the\nTrial Court embodied in the Settlement Agreement, and the Commissioner's\nblatant contempt of that order by flouting his regulatory authority and engaging\nin corrupt tactics. There may be no law greater settled than that a public official\ncan not violate an order of a court with impunity. The \"novel issue of law\ndefense\" is as much a pretext as is the Commissioner's contrived argument\nbefore this Court that the provisions of the Settlement Agreement were vague and\nambiguous, and the argument before the Trial Court that he was not a party to\nthe Settlement Agreement. The Trial Court, after hearing live testimony for\nthree weeks, sanctioned the Commissioner and his attorneys for contrived\nexplanations of his conduct which were described as \"sophistry,\" \"Alice in\nWonderland,\" and \"a tissue of fabrications.\" This Court should view his\nappellate arguments in the same dubious light.\nMuch of the same conduct of the Commissioner and his attorneys is\ncarried over into his appellate argument. The Commissioner has abused the\nappellate process by filing a 178 page Brief, consisting of 247 footnotes,\n171\n\nhighlightingeverypicayuneoccurrence over a three week trial. _ The appeal\nhas been a perpetuation of the same type of scorched earth strategy aimed at\nexhausting JRC's financial resources which the Commissioner and his staff have\npursued against JRC since August of 1993. It seems incredible that the\nCommissioner could assert that every one of the Trial Court's 303 express\nfindings of fact, are clearly erroneous. As JRC has set forth in its clearly\nerroneous argument, many of the factual arguments are based on factual snippets\nof testimony, and includes taking the evidence out of context, misrepresenting\nmany of the facts, and distorting the testimony and the factual findings of the\nTrial court without proper substantiation in the record. See Avery v. Steele, 414\nMass. at 456, QUOtin_ from Romala Corp, v, United Slate4, 927 F.2d 1219, 1224\n(Fed. Cir. 1991). The Trial Court's factual findings are consistently distorted\nand sensationalized by the Commissioner, who then attacks the distortions as\n\"clearly erroneous\". Perhaps the most telling example of such distortion and\nmisrepresentation is on page 152 of the Commissioner's Brief where he states,\nthat the Trial Court found the Commissioner and his staff \"to have aggressively\nmonitored and regulated BRI's compliance with state regulations.\" Even if the\nCommissioner's Brief had any merit, which it does not, \"[ilnappropriate\nargument and unsubstantiated statements in a brief may infect an otherwise\nmeritorious appeal so pervasively to make it frivolous.\" Av._, su_.0p.._a,t 456.\nLikewise, as JRC has established throughout its argument section, the\nCommissioner misapplies legal principles and cites out of context many of the\ncases on which he relies. Such a continued pattern of miscitation of authority\ncan only be attributed to an intentional attempt to deceive this Court, just as the\nCommissioner perpetrated below. Where, as here, \"appellate tactics.., consist\n[ ] almost entirely of irrelevant and misleading arguments as well as outright\nmisrepresentation, [such tactics] exceed all permissible bounds of zealous\nThe Commissioner exacerbatedhisappellateintransigence inhisattempt to stay\nthe judgment pending appeal on five occasions, including a petition for extraordinary\nrelief pursuant to G.

See _, su_, at 303 (citations\nomitted). JRC should be compensated for having to respond to 178 pages of\n\"sophistry,\" for being forced to recreate an accurate account of the findings to\ncounter the distorted view of the facts and trial testimony by reviewing fifteen\nvolumes of trial transcript and hundreds of exhibits, and for having to retry this\ncase on appeal. Furthermore, not only isJRC faced with defending this frivolous\nappeal, this Court isburdened with having to exhaust judicial resources to review\nevery case as well as every factual citation to the record since the Commissioner\nhas misrepresented the findings and conclusions of the Trial Court. \"By forcing\nthe court to expand extra time and effort in carefully double-checking every\nreference to the record and opposing counsel's briefs, lest [this court] be misled,\nsuch argumentation threatens the integrity of the judicial process and increases\nthe waste of resources.\" Av__, su_, at 456, uo_ from, Romala, su_, at\n1225. The Commissioner and his attorneys have carried into the appellate realm\nthe same conduct which caused the Trial Court to make findings of bad faith and\ncorruption, and compelled the Trial Court to make references to the district\nattorney for witness perjury and to the Board of Bar Overseers for attorney\nmisconduct. This Court should not allow the egregious misconduct of the\nCommissioner, DMR, and their attorneys in this appeal to go unpunished.\n173\n\nVII. SJC-06956 AND SJC-07045 APPEAL FROM TIlE\nINTERLOCUTORY ORDERS\nA. SJC-06956 Has Been Rendered Moot By Entry Of Final\n_udgmenl\nIt is well-settled that a preliminary injunction does not survive the entry\nof final judgment in the action in which the injunctive relief was originally\ngranted:\nWhen a final decree is entered, a preliminary injunction has\nserved its purpose. If the Plaintiff is then deemed entitled to an\ninjunction, the final decree can provide it... [A] preliminary\ninjunction does not survive the entry of a final decree [which\nbecomes effective as soon as entered], whether relief is thereby\ngranted or denied.\nCarlton v. Lawrence H. Oppenheim CO., 334 Mass. 462, 465 (1956),\nfrom Lgv;ell Bar Association v. Lgeh, 315 Mass. 176, 189-190 (1943); see __ks_O_,\nl.pnThe Matter Of McKni_ht, 406 Mass. at 792 n.4 (preliminary injunction\nremains in effect only until a final judgment is rendered). Thus, an appellate\ncourt will normally refuse to undertake any review of a preliminary injunction\nonce final judgment has entered because all issues concerning the propriety of the\npreliminary injunction are extinguished and rendered moot by the entry of afinal\norder. See Mah0ny v. Board of Assessors of Watertown, 362 Mass. 210, 216\nn.3 (1972); see also 8A Smith & Zobel, Rule._Practice §65.10, p.92 (1984) (full\ndetermination of case by Trial Court renders appellate review of preliminary\ninjunction moot).\nEven if the Trial Court had not expressly dissolved the status _q_\npreliminary injunction in its Judgment and Order, (App. 1342), the entry of final\njudgment in the underlying contempt proceeding on October 6, 1995,\nimmediately and automatically extinguished the preliminary injunction as a matter\nof law leaving nothing for this Court to decide regarding to the propriety of\npreliminary injunctive relief. In practical terms, this Court cannot grant any\nrelief in either vacating or affirming the preliminary injunction which will not be\nsubsumed in the decision on the appeal on the merits from the contempt\njudgment. The entry of final judgment expressly and by operation of law, has\n174\n\nrendered an appeal from the preliminary judgment moot and SJC-06956 does not\npresent any live issues for this Court to decide.\nB. SJC-07045, the Modified Interlocutory Orders of the Trial Court\nShould Be Vacated\nI. The modified preliminary injunction is moot\nThe order of the Single Justice of the Appeals Court in 95-J-300 is\nmerely a modified preliminary injunction. There is no question that, as already\ndiscussed in regards to SJC-06956, had the Single Justice not modified the status\npreliminary injunction, itwould have been rendered moot by the entry of the\nfinal judgment. Thus, it logically follows that the entry of final judgment in the\nunderlying contempt proceeding automatically extinguished the modified version\nof the preliminary injunction as a matter of law leaving nothing for this Court to\ndecide in regards to the first prong of the consolidated appeal.\n2. The modified order 9n the global moli0n is vacated by\n_h_ final Judgment\nThe Appeals Court Single Justice expressly incorporated the order on the\nmodified preliminary injunction in 95-J-300 into his order partially vacating the\ndenial of the Global Motion in 95-J-362. (S.A. 135). Although the Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court issued no opinion and did not give JRC an\nopportunity to respond to the Commissioner's petition, both orders on their face\nshow that they were both based upon and connected with the modification of the\noriginal preliminary injunction. Thus, the order modifying the Global Motion\nwas likewise vacated when the underlying preliminary injunction, as subsequently\nmodified by the Single Justice, was extinguished upon entry of final judgment.\nFurthermore, the Single Justice in modifying the Global Motion approved\nand upheld condition 96-1 in the Commissioner's January 20 Letter, by ordering\nthe four specific Level 111aversive therapies decertified in the letter terminated\nand removed from all treatment plans. (S.A. 135). Although theTrial Court did\nnot revoke any of the outstanding certification decisions by the Commissioner in\nissuing its judgment, the Trial Court ordered the receiver to review all such\n175\n\nregulatorydecisionismposedon JRC by the Commissioner to ensure that such\nregulation complied with the Settlement Agreement and the law, and to revoke\nany that did not. (App. 1343-44). Allowing the order of the Single Justice,\nwhich upholds the Commissioner's decision terminating the four treatments, to\nstand would result in an irreconcilable conflict with the express relief granted in\nthe ludgment and Order. The inconsistency is exemplified by the fact that the\nreceiver has since rescinded the January 20 Letter in whole, yet JRC is unable\nto apply any of the four court-approved Level I11 therapies in condition 96-1\nbecause the receiver has deferred to the outstanding order of the Single Justice.\n(S.A. 81). The untenable result is that an interlocutory order controls where a\nfinal judgment exists, and that the full relief of the Judgment and Order cannot\nbe enjoyed because of the modification of the Global Motion. Likewise, the\norder of the Single Justice upholding the Commissioner's termination of these\nfour treatments continues to violate Part A of the Settlement Agreement, which\nrequires that the Trial Court, not the Commissioner, make treatment decisions.\nThe modified Global Motion can no longer stand in light of the entry of final\njudgment, the relief granted and the terms of the Settlement Agreement, must be\nvacated by this Court.\n176\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center,\nlnc, requests this Honorable Court to:\n1. Affirm the judgment of contempt and relief granted by the Trial\nCourt;\n2. Award them costs and appellate attorneys' fees;\n3. Dismiss with prejudice the appeal from the preliminary\ninjunction; and\n4.

See 11 C.A. Wright & A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2947, at 423–424 (1973). A preliminary \n \ninjunction remains in effect only until a final judgment is rendered. See id. at 427. \nThe injunction in this case goes much further than simply preserving the status quo until David can prove his case at trial. \nIndeed, it relieves David of his burden of proving anything at trial. Under the terms of the injunction, there will be no trial on the \nmerits of David’s claims. The judge effectively rendered a final determination of David’s rights based on the evidence presented \nat the expedited preliminary injunction hearing. If one were to accept the dissent’s view, every permanent injunction requiring \ncontinuing compliance with an order would be a preliminary injunction because it could be modified. \n \n5  Due process of law principles of the State Constitution are expressed by arts. 1, 10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights and Part II, \nc. 1, § 1, art. 4. Pinnick v. Cleary, 360 Mass. 1, 14 n. 8, 271 N.E.2d 592 (1971). \n \n \n6  The first sentence of art. 10 provides: “Each individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, \nliberty and property, according to standing laws.” No case has said that art. 10 alone places an affirmative obligation on the \n \nCommonwealth to protect the life, liberty, or property of an individual at public expense beyond whatever obligations are imposed \nby  statute  or  the  common  law.  Cases  involving  art.  10  have  generally  concerned  claims  that  special  legislation  has \nunconstitutionally favored one person at the expense of one or more other persons. See Boston v. Keene Corp., 406 Mass. 301, \n306–308, 547 N.E.2d 328 (1989), and cases cited. We need not decide in this case whether art. 10, independent of its expression of \ndue process of law rights, requires the Commonwealth to furnish services to David. \n \n7  Article 114 of the Amendments provides that: “No otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by reason of his \nhandicap, be excluded from the participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or \n \nactivity within the commonwealth.” Even if we assume that a “program or activity” is involved in this case, we see no \ndiscrimination against David because of his handicap. All participants under the department’s responsibility are handicapped to \none degree or another. The department is not excluding David from anything because of his handicap. The recognition of \nhandicapped persons as a class in art. 114 may influence certain analyses of the constitutional rights of handicapped persons. In the \nsituation before the court, however, art. 114 has no application. \n \n8  The judge erroneously concluded that there was a denial of equal protection of the laws because an individual who was dangerous \nand mentally ill could obtain emergency care and treatment pursuant to G.L. c. 123, § 12 (1988 ed.), whereas a person who was \n \nmentally retarded and dangerous had no parallel right. Even if we accept that David is not mentally ill (his guardianship proceeding \ninvolved a determination that he was mentally ill) and thus § 12 is inapplicable to him, there is no denial of equal protection. \nSection 12 involves a civil commitment against the will of a person, and is not concerned with the long-term or involuntary \ntreatment of that person. It is unclear how the absence of a precisely parallel statute similarly restricting the rights of retarded \npersons harms David or gives him (as a mentally retarded person) a basis for successfully claiming the denial of equal protection. \nIn any event, G.L. c. 201, § 14 (1988 ed.), provides a reasonably parallel procedure for the admission of a mentally retarded person \nto a facility in an emergency. There is no basis on the record for concluding that dangerous mentally ill persons have been given \nsome preference over dangerous mentally retarded persons that is relevant here. Moreover, even if there were such a difference, \nand if it were found to violate equal protection of the laws principles, it is not clear that the constitutional violation would give \nDavid any right to the entry of a preliminary injunction of the scope that was entered here. \n \n9  We have suggested that the unavailability of appropriated funds would not justify the failure of prison officials to stop violating \ninmates’ constitutional rights (a) to equal protection of the laws and (b) not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. See \n \nBlaney v. Commissioner of Correction, 374 Mass. 337, 342 n. 3, 372 N.E.2d 770 (1978). In such a case, if the authorities lack \nappropriated funds sufficient to perform all their duties without violating constitutional rights, a cure would be the early release of \n  9 \n \n\n \n \nsome inmates. \nWhere constitutional rights of a severely mentally retarded person are involved, the problem of inadequate funds may be more \nintense because the release of such a person may not be an available option. In this appeal, we need not consider whether, to \nprotect David’s rights (statutory or constitutional), the department, confronted with an appropriation proven to be insufficient to \npermit it to care for all persons within its responsibility, would have to deny services to mentally retarded persons less severely \nafflicted than David in order to be able to meet David’s needs. \n \n10  Speaking for a nearly unanimous Court in the Youngberg case, Justice Powell said: “If, as seems the case, respondent seeks only \ntraining related to safety and freedom from restraints, this case does not present the difficult question whether a mentally retarded \n \nperson, involuntarily committed to a state institution, has some general constitutional right to training per se, even when no type or \namount of training would lead to freedom.” Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 318, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2459, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). \nJustice Blackmun, concurring in an opinion joined in by Justices Brennan and O’Connor, said: “The second difficult question left \nopen today is whether respondent has an independent constitutional claim, grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, to the ‘habilitation’ or training necessary to preserve those basic self-care skills he possessed when he first entered \nPennhurst—for example, the ability to dress himself and care for his personal hygiene. In my view, it would be consistent with the \nCourt’s reasoning today to include within the ‘minimally adequate training required by the Constitution,’ ante, at 322, [102 S.Ct. at \n2461], such training as is reasonably necessary to prevent a person’s pre-existing self-care skills from deteriorating because of his \ncommitment. \n“... For many mentally retarded people, the difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and \ntotal dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will know.” (Emphasis in original.) Id. at \n327, 102 S.Ct. at 2464 (Blackmun, J., concurring). \n \n11  In the DeShaney case, the United States Supreme Court held that an individual’s due process rights were not violated when the \nState failed to provide him with adequate protective services against private violence. Id. 109 S.Ct. at 1004. The Court \n \ndistinguished circumstances discussed in Youngberg v. Romeo, supra, on the ground that a State’s constitutional obligation to care \nfor a person arises only when the State takes custody of that person against his will. DeShaney, supra at 1004–1006. The DeShaney \nopinion has been criticized for failing to recognize, and to give effect to, the significant role the State of Wisconsin played by \nomission in the harm that came to Joshua DeShaney. See id. at 1010–1011 (Brennan, J., dissenting); id. at 1012 (Blackmun, J., \ndissenting) The DeShaney decision has also been described as broad and harsh. See Philadelphia Police & Fire Ass’n for \nHandicapped Children, Inc. v. Philadelphia, 874 F.2d 156, 166 (3d Cir.1989). \n \n12  We find the Supreme Court’s distinction between the rights of persons involuntarily held by the State and those not so held to be \nuninstructive in the case of a person like David. By application of principles of substituted judgment, one might expect that David \n \nwould “voluntarily” accept placement and care by the department. If “he” did so, however, the DeShaney opinion suggests that, if \nthe Commonwealth omitted some needed level of care, it would not be denying due process of law to David, who, in a substituted \njudgment sense, would be voluntarily in the Commonwealth’s custody. A more sophisticated exercise of substituted judgment \nmight reject care by the Commonwealth, in the hope that the Commonwealth would hold David involuntarily (against “his” \nsubstituted judgment), and thus implicate a liberty interest under Federal due process principles. \n \n13  As a practical matter, such an order might have required the department to leave David at BRI, at least for some months. \n \n \n14  At a hearing on the question of the entry of a preliminary injunction, new evidence need be considered only as to circumstances \narising since the entry of the preliminary order. Contrary to the dissent’s view, the question of aversives need not be revisited \n \nbefore a preliminary order is entered. \n \n15  The motion of BRI and David’s father to amend their briefs to include a claim for attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal is allowed. \nThe allowance of the motion does not imply, however, that either is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal. \n \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  10 \n ",

Israel, executive director of The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, Inc. (JRC); Leo Soucy, individually and as \nparent and next friend of Brendon Soucy; and Peter Biscardi, individually and as parent and next friend of P.J. Biscardi, both as \n \nrepresentatives of the class of all patients at the Behavior Research Institute, Inc., their parents, and guardians. At the time of the \nsettlement agreement, JRC was known as the Behavior Research Institute, Inc. We shall refer to the plaintiff as JRC. \n \n2  The director of the office for children, the predecessor in interest of the Department of Mental Retardation (department) was \noriginally named as the defendant in this case. \n \n \n3  The settlement agreement dated December 12, 1986, provided in part: “On or before July 1, 1987, the licensing responsibility for \n[JRC] shall be transferred from [OFC] to [the Department of Mental Health] in accordance with an interagency agreement....” On \n \nJuly 1, 1987, however, the department assumed the legal responsibility for licensing JRC, St.1986, c. 599, and on October 24, \n1988, moved that the settlement agreement be modified to clarify that “it has also assumed [the Department of Mental Health’s] \nobligations under the Settlement Agreement.” The judge treated the department’s motion as a motion to intervene under Mass. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b)(2), 365 Mass. 769 (1974), and “welcome[d] it as a party under the settlement agreement.” \n \n4  Prior to trial, the contempt complaint was amended several times. After the judge allowed JRC’s motion to file a third amended \ncomplaint, she issued a preliminary injunction. The department appealed from this injunction to a full panel of the Appeals Court \n \npursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 118, par. second. This court thereafter granted direct appellate review, and that appeal is the subject of \nanother case, also decided today. Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. (No. 2). v. Commissioner of the Dep’t of Mental Retardation, \n424 Mass. 471, 677 N.E.2d 153 (1997). In addition, the department petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to \nG.L. c. 231, § 118, par. first, for interlocutory relief from or modification of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The single \njustice modified the injunction and later, in response to a request for clarification, enjoined JRC from using certain challenged \n“Level III” aversive treatments. The single justice also heard an appeal from the Probate Court judge’s order pursuant to a “global \nmotion” filed by guardianship counsel on behalf of 52 JRC patients in each of their individual guardianship cases requesting the \nProbate Court judge to issue orders requiring JRC to cease using certain Level III aversive procedures. The single justice of the \nAppeals Court allowed the patients’ petition and incorporated by reference the previous order that had been entered and clarified, \nas the orders dealt with the same aversive treatments. A single justice of this court denied JRC’s request for relief from the order of \nthe single justice of the Appeals Court. JRC then appealed to the full panel of the Appeals Court, and we granted the department’s \napplication for direct appellate review. That appeal is also the subject of another case decided today. Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., \nInc. v. Commissioner of the Dep’t of Mental Retardation (No. 3), 424 Mass. 473, 677 N.E.2d 155 (1997). \n \n5  Part A of the settlement agreement provides that “[a]versive procedures are permitted for use at [JRC] only when authorized as part \nof a court-ordered ‘substituted judgment’ treatment plan for an individual client, when such client is either a minor or is not able to \n \nprovide informed consent thereto.” \nPart B of the settlement agreement provides: “On each occasion when the Court issues a substituted judgment treatment plan, the \nCourt shall also appoint a monitor who will report to the Court as to the effectiveness of the treatment plan, adherence to order \nby [JRC], and any proposed modifications to the treatment plan.” Part B also provides that the judge would appoint a suitable \nperson “who shall undertake general monitoring of [JRC]’s treatment and educational program.” The court monitor was also to \nbe responsible for “overseeing [JRC]’s compliance with all applicable state regulations, except to the extent that those \nregulations involve treatment procedures authorized by the Court in accordance with [part] A.” Finally, part B provides that the \ncourt monitor “shall arbitrate any disputes between the parties, and in the event that any party disagrees with any decision or \nrecommendation of the [court monitor], the matter shall be submitted to the Court for resolution.” \nPart C of the settlement agreement provides in part that “intake at [JRC] for new clients shall be reopened and shall not be \nimpermissibly obstructed during the pendency of this agreement.” \nFinally, part L of the settlement agreement provides that “each party shall discharge its obligations under the terms of this \nagreement, in good faith.” \n \n6  Originally the settlement agreement provided that a review would occur every six months with the settlement agreement \nautomatically terminating at the second review unless the judge ordered otherwise. After the second six-month review, the judge \n \nextended the agreement until further order of the court. \n \n7  The judge made 304 findings of fact, but the last two were numbered 303. The department disputes all of the 304 findings of fact. \nWe therefore review those facts that are necessary to support a finding of contempt and the imposition of certain remedies. \n \n  15 \n \n\n \n \n \n8  At the time of the trial the applicable regulations were codified in 104 Code Mass. Regs. § 20.15. The regulations, as of September, \n1995, appear at 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14. \n \nLevel III aversive therapies are defined by the department regulations as “[a]ny Intervention which involves the contingent \napplication of physical contact aversive stimuli such as spanking, slapping, or hitting;” “Time Out wherein an individual is \nplaced in a room alone for a period of time exceeding 15 minutes;” “[a]ny Intervention not listed ... as a Level I or Level II \nIntervention which is highly intrusive and/or highly restrictive of freedom of movement;” or “[a]ny Intervention which alone, in \ncombination with other Interventions, or as a result of multiple applications of the same Intervention poses a significant risk of \nphysical or psychological harm to the individual.” 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(3)(d) (1995). \nUnder the department’s regulations, “No Behavior Modification plans employing Level III Interventions may be implemented \nexcept in a program or a distinct part of a program that ... is ... specially certified by the Department as having authority to \nadminister such treatment.” 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(4)(f) (1995). \nBefore a program can be certified, a comprehensive evaluation is made of a program. As part of the evaluation, a program must \nprovide “a comprehensive statement of the program’s policies and procedures for the development and implementation of plans \nemploying Level III Interventions, including a description of the program’s actual use, or proposed use, of such procedures, and \nof the program’s policies and practices regarding the training and supervision of all staff involved in the use of such \nprocedures.” 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(4)(f)(3). The department then reviews the program, and has access to written plans \ndesigned for patients that are reviewed to ensure that they comport with applicable regulations, the physical facility, and the \nprofessional credentials of the program’s employees. In addition, the department also has the opportunity to observe the \ntreatment employed by the program. 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(4)(f)(6). In short, a decision to certify a program is an \nacknowledgment that the program is complying with all applicable regulations. 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(4)(f)(7). \n \n9  Patients in this program are given a daily caloric requirement based on standardized height and weight charts. They do not receive \nany food except that earned by passing “behavior contracts” which require that the patient not exhibit some or all of his or her \n \ntarget behavior for a specified period of time. Patients who earn less than their daily caloric requirement are provided “makeup \nfood” in the evening if they receive less than twenty per cent of their caloric requirement during the day. Under the program, a \npatient could remain on the reduced calorie diet until his or her weight was 87.5% of his or her mid-weight of the desired range. \n \n10  The GED (graduated electronic decelerator) program is a procedure which involves an electrical stimulus which is utilized when a \nclient engages in maladaptive behavior. \n \n \n11  The GED-4 is a stronger version of the GED. \n \n \n12  The judge also found that the commissioner’s actions toward JRC were motivated at least in part because of his fear that the \nagency might be portrayed in a negative light by the CBS News television program “Eye-to-Eye.” CBS News had contacted the \n \ndepartment in the spring of 1993 and requested certain information relative to JRC. The commissioner spoke to the producer of the \nshow and was concerned that the show might depict the department as not doing its job in regulating JRC. While the commissioner \ntestified that he never did anything in anticipation of that program, documents revealed that the commissioner had taken certain \nactions with the television program in mind. \n \n13  See note 4, supra. \n \n \n14  The department argues that the judge’s “entire application of the law of contempt to the facts of this case” consisted of these two \nsentences and that therefore the judge did not make clear what conduct by the department constituted “clear and undoubted \n \ndisobedience” of the settlement agreement. This argument is without merit. The judge made extensive factual findings, many of \nwhich referenced the provisions in the settlement agreement that had been violated by such actions. In addition, in the order \ndenying the department’s motion to stay the judgment pending an appeal, the judge further specified which of her factual findings \nconstituted violations of the settlement agreement. \nWe note also that the judge denied the department’s counterclaim alleging that JRC had violated the settlement agreement. The \ndepartment does not appeal from the decision denying the counterclaim. \n \n15  Evidence considered at a substituted judgment hearing includes the ward’s expressed preferences regarding treatments, the ward’s \nreligious convictions, the impact on the ward’s family, the probability of adverse side effects, and the prognosis with and without \n \ntreatment. Guardianship of Roe, 411 Mass. 666, 673, 583 N.E.2d 1282 (1992), and cases cited. In addition to the information \nordinarily presented at a substituted judgment proceeding, the settlement agreement mandated that JRC present eleven additional \npieces of information as well, including evidence of the client’s present and past psychological and medical circumstances, target \nbehaviors to be treated by means of aversive procedures, the clinical reasons why nonaversives or less intrusive aversive \nprocedures are inappropriate, and the professional disciplines of the staff members who will implement such aversive or \nextraordinary procedures. \n \n  16 \n \n\n \n \n16  The regulations state that “a Behavior Modification plan employing Level II or Level III Interventions may not be implemented \nunless it has been consented to in accordance with the following requirements.” 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(4)(e). The \n \n“requirements” provide that, if an individual is not capable of giving informed consent, a judge, through a substituted judgment \nproceeding, must authorize aversive treatments. Id. \n \n17  The judge made no explicit finding regarding whether the settlement agreement contemplated that JRC would no longer be \nregulated by the department. \n \n \n18  The court monitor testified that, while the licensing process and the certification process evolved into two separate concepts after \nthe settlement agreement was reached, with licensing pertaining to the operation of facilities and certification pertaining to a \n \nfacility’s use of Level III aversives, he discussed certification with the department because “the [s]ettlement [a]greement required \nthat [JRC] become licensed and because certification was part of the overall licensing process.” \n \n19  We do not consider whether the portion of the agreement providing that it was the court monitor, not the department, that was to \noversee compliance with all other applicable State regulations except those related to Level III aversives and undertake general \n \nmonitoring of JRC’s treatment and educational program constituted an impermissible delegation of regulatory authority. The \nfindings of the judge with respect to this portion of the settlement agreement are not necessary for our decision here; we note, \nmoreover, that neither side disputes that JRC was required to be certified according to the department’s regulations, and it is that \ncertification process and its relationship to the settlement agreement that is before us. \n \n20  Contrary to the department’s argument, its own regulations do not contemplate its having such unilateral power over individual \ntreatment plans. While the department argues that language in the policy section of the applicable regulations stating that “[t]he use \n \nof such procedures for a particular individual will be allowed for a particular client only after a rigorous review and approval by \nclinicians, human rights committees, and the department” and that “such procedures are only to be used in programs which are \nspecially qualified and certified to use such procedures with appropriate care ... [and] the application of a procedure for clients \neven after it has been approved must be strictly monitored by the program as well as by the [d]epartment itself” demonstrate its \npower over individual treatment plans, we conclude that the language is consistent with our reading of the regulations-if that \nmonitoring reveals any problems, that information should be brought to the judge who has authorized the use of aversive \ntreatments. 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(1)(c). Moreover, although the department claims to have certified the use of aversive \ntherapies on individual patients at various facilities, the assistant commissioner for quality assurance conceded that there is no \nauthority in the regulations for approval of Level III procedures “in the absence of a certification as a program.” \n \n21  For example, in March of 1992, the department’s general counsel responded to a letter inquiring about JRC’s use of behavior \nmodification procedures with respect to two patients and stated that “the [d]epartment is currently bound by a settlement agreement \n \nwith respect to this program. All so-called aversive interventions used at [JRC] must be approved by the Bristol County Probate \nCourt; the [d]epartment’s involvement in the actual treatment is limited.” In addition, after initially granting certification to JRC on \nApril 20, 1989, the department attached to the initial grant of certification a memorandum which addressed the potential conflict \nbetween substituted judgment orders of the Probate Court and the department regulations. The memorandum noted that the \ndepartment’s treatment plans should not be amended until after a substituted judgment hearing before the Probate Court, and stated \nthat such interpretation of the regulations “is necessary to prevent conflicting decisions by departmental hearing officers and the \nProbate Court, [because] obviously an executive branch hearing officer cannot overrule a court decision.” The memorandum also \nnoted that such a practice was “consistent with departmental practice in [other] cases.” \n \n22  The letter stated: “This certification excludes authorization for [JRC] to continue to use indefinitely Level III interventions for six \nindividuals....” \n \n \n23  One of the individuals had been the subject of a recent five-day treatment plan review by the Probate Court. The Probate Court \njudge had conducted a treatment plan review, commencing on October 31, 1994, and concluding December 21, 1994, specifically \n \napproving Level III aversive therapy for the individual who was one of the most difficult to treat patients at JRC. See Guardianship \nof Brandon, 424 Mass. 482, 677 N.E.2d 114 (1997). See also note 19, supra. \n \n24  Q.: “Commissioner, starting in the summer or fall of 1993, you started having weekly meetings concerning [JRC]’s application for \ncertification; is that correct?” \n \nA.: “Yes.” \nQ.: “Those meetings dealt strictly with the issue of [JRC]’s application for certification?” \nA.: “Yes.” \nQ.: “They were not assembled for any other purpose?” \nA.: “That’s correct.” \nWhile the judge concluded that the “materially false statements under oath ... would support a prosecution for perjury” and \nreferred “the matter to the District Attorney ... for a determination as to whether a prosecution for perjury and/or criminal \ncontempt should be instituted,” we need not consider whether the evidence would support a perjury charge. \n  17 \n \n\n \n \n \n25  While the department argues that all 304 findings of fact are clearly erroneous, nowhere in its brief does it challenge the findings \nthat these topics were, in fact, discussed at the meetings, and that the commissioner testified they did not have anything to do with \n \ncertification. Rather, the department tries to sidestep the issue, arguing only that the commissioner never claimed not to have \ndiscussed these issues and therefore cannot be found to have acted in bad faith. The department’s argument ignores that it is not \nsolely the commissioner’s denial or admission of these actions that warranted a finding of contempt-it was the actions themselves \nthat demonstrated the department was regulating the JRC in bad faith. \n \n26  The department argues that the information regarding the receivership petition revealed by the work plans is protected by the \nattorney-client privilege. We agree with the judge that the information is not protected by the privilege. The attorney-client \n \nprivilege protects communications made between a lawyer and a client for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. See Purcell v. \nDistrict Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 424 Mass. 109, 115, 676 N.E.2d 436 (1997); Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge v. Praught, 35 \nMass.App.Ct. 290, 296, 619 N.E.2d 346 (1993). We must, however, construe the privilege narrowly. Commonwealth v. O’Brien, \n377 Mass. 772, 775, 388 N.E.2d 658 (1979). Thus, while the department analogizes to Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, \n101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981), where the Supreme Court recognized that for a corporate lawyer to function effectively, it is \noften necessary for the lawyer to obtain information from middle and lower-level employees in order to advise the corporation \nappropriately, id. at 394, 101 S.Ct. at 685, that case is inapposite where, as here, there has been no showing that all of those present \nat the meeting provided the department’s counsel with information she needed in order to advise the department, nor has there been \na showing that all those present at the meeting were seeking legal advice. Rather, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the \nconclusion that the meeting was a general policy meeting. Thus, while the documents would be protected from mandatory \ndisclosure during the time the policy was being developed, G.L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth (d); Babets v. Secretary of Human Servs., \n403 Mass. 230, 237 n. 8, 526 N.E.2d 1261 (1988), after the policy decision has been made there is no privilege. Id. at 238-239, 526 \nN.E.2d 1261. \n \n27  The judge also noted that the Rivendell review team requested indemnification from the department for its review of JRC. \n \n \n28  Other examples of the department’s putting its plan into action include the letters sent by the department to the funding agencies \nwhich contained misleading and false information. The department argues that the commissioner had a good faith basis for all of \n \nthe statements and the conditions contained in the various letters. While we need not review all of the letters, we note, for example, \nthat the letter of August 6, stated that the department had found “continued and repeated noncompliance with [the department] \nregulations.” Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that the judge’s finding that the letter was sent in an attempt to \ninterfere with JRC’s relationships with funding agencies was not clearly erroneous. Indeed, this statement was in direct conflict \nwith the report of the 1993 review team that had been submitted just a few weeks prior to the August 6, letter and the 1991 report, \nboth of which the commissioner testified that he had not read at the time he sent the letter. Moreover, the commissioner was asked, \n“[W]ould it be fair to state that you ... did not review the reports of your certification team, you did not review the court orders of \nthe Bristol County Probate Court and you did not review any of the evaluations of the psychologists who had been appointed by \nthe [department]; is that a fair statement?” He responded, “Yes.” Thus, it is clear that there is ample evidence to support the \ninference that the letter was sent in bad faith as part of the plan to put JRC out of business. \n \n29  For example, on the first day of trial, the assistant general counsel testified that the 1993 review team’s report and the 1991 review \nteam’s report were not submitted to the judge on September 22, 1993, when the department submitted other information. The \n \njudge, on learning that these favorable reports had not been presented to her stated: “My mind is always open to what you present \nme. But I’m faced with misrepresentations to the Court and I welcome an explanation as to why it should not be characterized in \nthat way and I am looking forward to it and I hope that it’s presented soon.” \n \n30  Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), 365 Mass. 780 (1974), the department requested JRC to produce “the person with the most \nknowledge with regard to the factual basis for the allegations contained in the Third Amended Complaint.” In response, JRC \n \nproduced the executive director of JRC, who testified about matters germane to the complaint, but claimed to have no \nparticularized knowledge relevant to JRC’s financial condition. Discovery ended before the department could depose anyone who \nhad particularized knowledge; the judge denied the department’s motion to extend discovery beyond May 18, 1995. \nThe department failed to state with particularity in its original request under rule 30(b)(6), its desire to depose someone with \nparticularized knowledge concerning JRC’s financial condition. See Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.) v. Puerto Rico Water Resources \nAuth., 93 F.R.D. 62, 66 (D.P.R.1981). Given the broad net cast by the department’s request for “the person with the most \nknowledge with regard to the factual basis for the allegations contained in the Third Amended Complaint,” JRC’s executive \ndirector was the logical official to attend the deposition. \n \n31  JRC listed its accountant as an expert witness in its pretrial memorandum. In addition, an offer of proof as to the accountant’s \nqualification as an expert witness was made in writing on the first day of trial. \n \n \n32  The judge denied the motion on the ground that, “This is a treatment decision which belongs in the substitute judgment process; it \n  18 \n \n\n \n \n  does not belong here.” \n \n33  The power to appoint a receiver is not limited to constitutional violations. Perez v. Boston Hous. Auth., 379 Mass. 703, 733 n. 27, \n400 N.E.2d 1231 (1980). \n \n \n34  In the January 20, 1995, letter, the commissioner ordered JRC to discontinue court-authorized aversive therapy for six patients. \n \n \n35  The commissioner did not apprise the judge or the court monitor of the serious allegations made in the August 6, 1993, letter. He \nconsidered contacting the court monitor prior to writing the letter, but elected not to do so. The department argues that this finding \n \nis clearly erroneous because the department had no obligation to bring these matters to the attention of the judge. This argument \ndoes not attack the factual finding itself but is directed to the significance of the finding. \n \n36  On September 22, 1993, the department filed a report to the judge regarding the status of JRC. This report failed to contain two \ncertification team reports dated December 21, 1991, and July 15, 1993, which recommended that the department certify JRC. \n \n \n37  JRC staff was forced to take time away from its patients in order to meet department’s excessive regulatory demands. As a result, \nJRC cut back on positive programming, individualized care, and precision teaching programs. \n \n \n38  Contrary to the commissioner’s argument, we read nothing in the powers authorized which would enable the receiver to operate \noutside the law. The receiver is subject to the same statutes and regulations as the department. See Spence v. Reeder, 382 Mass. \n \n398, 417-418, 416 N.E.2d 914 (1981). \n \n39  The preamble to the receiver’s powers provides: “The [c]ourt, pursuant to its equity jurisdiction shall appoint a [r]eceiver for [the \ndepartment], who shall have the full authority to administer, manage and operate [the department] in all of its relationships with \n \nJRC, its [patients], and their families, and who shall control all the funds and revenues of [the department] as they relate to JRC, \nits [patients] and their families and also will assume his authority and take office as soon as possible. Such [r]eceiver shall have \nand exercise all powers presently held by [the department] as well as any additional powers as may be necessary and appropriate.” \n(Emphasis added.) \n \n40  The receiver was authorized to conduct a de novo review of any outstanding regulatory decisions, including JRC’s certification. \n \n \n41  JRC has requested attorney’s fees for this appeal. See Mass. R.A.P. 25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979), and G.L. c. 211, § 10. \nWe do not consider this appeal frivolous as JRC argues, nor does JRC point to any statutory authority permitting the imposition of \n \nattorney’s fees. See Commonwealth v. One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, 413 Mass. 407, 415 n. 10, 597 N.E.2d 430 (1992); Yorke \nMgt. v. Castro, 406 Mass. 17, 19-20, 546 N.E.2d 342 (1989). Thus, JRC’s request for attorney’s fees for this appeal is also denied. \n \n42  In Commonwealth v. One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, 413 Mass. 407, 414-415, 597 N.E.2d 430 (1992), we upheld an award of \nattorney’s fees against the Commonwealth in a contempt action. The Commonwealth brought the original action, and thus the \n \naward of attorney’s fees was authorized by G.L. c. 261, § 14. See Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, 411 Mass. 489, 502 n. 14, 583 \nN.E.2d 241 (1992). \n \n43  A plaintiff need not litigate the action through final judgment to achieve prevailing party status. Interim success in securing \ninterlocutory relief qualifies the plaintiff as a prevailing party. See Handy v. Penal Insts. Comm’r of Boston, 412 Mass. 759, 765, \n \n592 N.E.2d 1303 (1992) (attorney’s fee proper where lawsuit important factor in achieving improvements in prisoners’ living \nconditions); Draper v.

Black, Infants-Next Friends-Actions, Settlements, \n \nand Attorneys’ Fees, 34 Mass. L.Q. 19, 19-20 (1949). A “guardian ad litem” described a person appointed to defend or prosecute a \nsuit on behalf of an incompetent person otherwise represented. Id. at 21-23. The distinction was only formal and the functions of \nthe two representatives were really the same. See N.O. v. Callahan, 110 F.R.D. 637, 648 n. 6 (D.Mass.1986). Today, we use \nguardian ad litem and next friend interchangeably. See G.L. c. 201, § 34. \n \n4  Substituted judgment standard describes a legal proceeding to determine whether an incompetent person would choose treatment if \ncompetent to make such a decision.

Motion for reconsideration. Finally, the department    \nargues that the judge erred as a matter of law when he  \t\r  \ndenied the department’s motion for reconsideration of the \ncourt order approving a treatment plan in light of the \n Footnotes \n \n  6 \n \n\n \n \n1  Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, Inc. (JRC), was formerly known as the Behavior Research Institute, Inc. (BRI). \n \n \n2  Level III aversive therapies are defined by Department of Mental Retardation (department) regulations as “[a]ny Intervention \nwhich involves the contingent application of physical contact aversive stimuli such as spanking, slapping or hitting;” “Time Out \n \nwherein an individual is placed in a room alone for a period of time exceeding 15 minutes;” “[a]ny Intervention not listed ... as a \nLevel I or Level II Intervention which is highly intrusive and/or highly restrictive of freedom of movement;” or “[a]ny Intervention \nwhich alone, in combination with other Interventions, or as a result of multiple applications of the same Intervention poses a \nsignificant risk of physical or psychological harm to the individual.” 115 Code Mass. Regs. § 5.14(3)(d) (1995). \nThe Level III aversive treatments that were part of the treatment plan proposed by JRC included an electronic shock device, the \ngraduated electronic decelerator-4 (GED-4), and the specialized food program. Patients in the specialized food program are \ngiven a daily caloric requirement based on standardized height and weight charts. They do not receive any food except that \nearned by passing “behavior contracts” which require that the patient not exhibit some or all of his or her target behaviors for a \nspecified period of time. Patients who earn less than their daily caloric requirement are provided “make-up food” in the evening \nif they receive less than 20% of their caloric requirement during the day. Under the program, a patient could remain on the \nreduced calorie diet until his or her weight was 87.5% of his or her mid-weight of the desired range. \n \n3  We note at the outset that the order stated that the treatment plan was to be in effect for twelve months from the date of the order, \nFebruary 10, 1995, and that the authorization for the administration of the plan would expire eighteen months from the date of the \n \norder. The record does not indicate that authorization for the plan has been extended, and technically the order has expired. \nBecause, however, all substituted judgment orders must be periodically reviewed and include a termination date, Guardianship of \nWeedon, 409 Mass. 196, 201, 565 N.E.2d 432 (1991), it is likely that the effective period of the order will be shorter than the \nperiod of time necessary to complete the appellate process. See Commonwealth v. Yameen, 401 Mass. 331, 333, 516 N.E.2d 1149 \n(1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1008, 108 S.Ct. 1735, 100 L.Ed.2d 198 (1988). Therefore, where as here it is clear that for as long as \nBrandon remains at JRC his treatment plan will continue to need court authorization because it includes aversive therapies, and it is \nlikely that issues regarding Brandon’s treatment will reoccur, “there is a significant public interest in clarifying the requirements \nfor review of substituted judgment treatment plans issued by the Probate Court.” Guardianship of Weedon, supra at 197, 565 \nN.E.2d 432. See First Nat’l Bank v. Haufler, 377 Mass. 209, 211, 385 N.E.2d 970 (1979) (“[a]n issue apt to evade review is one \nwhich tends to arise only in circumstances that create a substantial likelihood of mootness prior to completion of the appellate \nprocess”). \nWe note also that neither the department, JRC, or counsel for Brandon argues on appeal that this case should be dismissed as \nmoot because the order has expired. \n \n4  According to department regulations, all programs utilizing Level III aversive therapies must be certified by the department. 115 \nCode Mass. Regs. § 5.14(4)(f) (1995). The letter conditionally certified JRC but stated that “[t]his certification excludes \n \nauthorization for [JRC] to continue to use indefinitely Level III interventions for [six] individuals [including Brandon]” and \nprovided that “[JRC] may submit to the [d]epartment a new application for certification to use Level III interventions for any of the \n[six] individuals.” The letter also mandated that, “[i]f, after [thirty] days ... there is no certification application pending for any of \nthe [six] individuals, then no later than the [thirty-first] day after the date of this letter, [JRC] will begin modifying the behavior \nmodification plan(s) to treatment with Level I and II interventions for the individual(s) from the group of six for whom [JRC] is not \ncertified to continue to use Level III interventions.” \n \n5  Counsel for Brandon filed a memorandum in support of the department’s motion for reconsideration. \n \n \n6  On his arrival at JRC, Brandon initially was treated pursuant to a treatment plan authorized on June 15, 1989. That plan was \namended several times before permanent substituted judgment findings were entered on February 26, 1991; one such amendment \n \nauthorized the use of an electronic shock device known as the self-injurious behavior inhibiting system (SIBIS). \n \n7  The judge entered findings regarding the November, 1990, hearing on March 26, 1991. These findings stated that Brandon’s life-\nthreatening behaviors included vomiting and ruminating to the point where Brandon’s weight dropped to fifty-two pounds and he \n \nhad to be hospitalized. After three weeks of GED treatment, Brandon gained twenty pounds and his vomiting and ruminating \nbehaviors were dramatically reduced. Brandon was then removed from restraints and was able to manipulate a computer. \n \n8  Brandon’s treatment has also been affected by ongoing litigation between JRC and the department, and it is unclear whether \ncurrently there is authorization to treat Brandon with the GED-4. Following the January 20 letter, which required JRC either to \n \ncomply with department regulations or to modify Brandon’s treatment plan to exclude the use of Level III aversives, a single \njustice of the Appeals Court entered an order referencing the January 20 letter and stated that “any changes in treatment that do not \nrequire changes in treatment plans, including but not limited to cessation of the treatments [including the use of the GED-4 on \nBrandon after thirty days] do not require prior approval of the Court in substituted judgment proceedings.” This order was later \nclarified,  however,  to  specify  that  JRC  was  enjoined  from  using “automatic  negative  reinforcement  with  electric  shock, \nprogrammed multiple applications of electric shock, the specialized food program, and behavior rehearsal lessons using Level III \n  7 \n \n\n \n \ninterventions,” and it would appear that this clarification enjoined the use of the GED-4 without any conditions or limitations. See \nJudge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. v. Commissioner of the Dep’t of Mental Retardation (No. 3), 424 Mass. 430, & n. 4 (1997). \n \n9  All parties appear to concede that Brandon was the only person in the world, at least at the time of trial, treated with the GED-4. \n \n \n10  In counsel for Brandon’s proposed treatment plan, submitted on the last day of testimony, counsel for Brandon proposed that the \nuse of the GED-4: (1) be limited to certain clearly defined behavior, to be selected by the JRC clinician; (2) that the treatment with \n \nthe GED-4 be charted separately, accurately measuring its effectiveness; and (3) the number of shocks administered be limited to \nan absolute number of fifty per twenty-four hour period. It was urged that the specialized food program be eliminated from the \ntreatment plan, so as to better assess the effectiveness of the primary treatment modality, the GED-4. Finally, it was requested that \ncertain corollary procedures for use with the GED-4 be deleted from the treatment plan as they had not been previously used with \nBrandon. \n \n11  The record reflects that the judge had Brandon come to the courtroom so that the judge could observe him; the judge noted that his \nobservation of Brandon revealed that the indentation in Brandon’s cheek caused by his sucking behavior had almost completely \n \nhealed. \n \n12  While our discussion focuses on the probability of adverse side effects and the prognosis for Brandon with and without treatment, \nthe judge noted that Brandon, who is not verbal, “is not capable of expressing his preferences with regard to treatment, and there is \n \nno evidence of a religious conviction which would preclude utilizing the treatment plan proposed by JRC including the use of the \nGED-4 device.” The judge also noted that Brandon’s mother continues to consent to the treatment plan and found that Brandon’s \nfamily would be adversely affected if Brandon’s treatment under JRC’s treatment plan was not continued. Thus, the decision \nregarding Brandon’s substituted judgment turned on a consideration of the remaining factors. Guardianship of Roe, 383 Mass. 415, \n448, 421 N.E.2d 40 (1981) (judge must analyze relative weight of findings in particular case). \n \n13  The testimony of the expert was offered by the department but counsel for Brandon, in joining the department’s argument on \nappeal, argues that his testimony was critical to Brandon’s argument that the GED-4 should not be used in the manner proposed by \n \nJRC. \n \n14  Counsel for Brandon also suggests that Brandon was prejudiced because his witness would have had “more useful testimony” if he \nhad been allowed to testify longer. This argument is without merit. Indeed, counsel for Brandon stated that he had “no further \n \nquestions” for the witness and never objected to the dismissal of the witness. \n \n15  In denying the motion to reopen the expert’s testimony, the judge stated that, “[i]f counsel had wanted to continue with [the \nexpert’s] testimony, then counsel could have had [him] back at this time. But the counsel having agreed to the procedure with \n \nregard to direct and cross on that occasion concerning [the expert], the motion to reopen his testimony is going to be denied.” \n \n16  In concluding that the expert lacked an adequate foundation on which to base his testimony, the judge stated that he “had not seen \n[Brandon] and was only provided with a portion of the applicable records concerning [Brandon]. He failed to interview \n \n[Brandon’s] mother, the JRC case manager, and the supervising psychologist.” The judge further found that, “[i]n spite of a lack of \nfoundation, [the expert] was willing to present broad opinions concerning the JRC’s treatment plan. [The expert] conceded the \nobvious ethical problems with presenting testimony without an adequate foundation.” \nMoreover, while the department points out that the guardian ad litem stated that “[w]e have done an injustice by not having the \nbenefit of what [the expert] might have contributed,” we note that the record makes clear that the guardian ad litem was \nobjecting to the fact that the expert “was done an injustice in being subjected to this proceeding” in light of the fact that it \nappeared the department “was invited to consider the opportunity of inviting [the expert] to the institute so that he might have \nthe opportunity to examine [Brandon] and make such examination on grounds as he saw fit to transact his professional opinion \nmaking” but that the department “saw fit to decline that” invitation. \n \n17  The judge stated, “[Y]ou’ve got two other psychologists on this list. I’ll let you have one. You decide which one you want and that \nis directed to both counsel for [Brandon] and counsel for the [d]epartment.” We note that, despite this order, three expert witnesses \n \ncalled by the department were allowed to testify. \n \n18  In refusing to accept the report as an exhibit, the judge stated that there was a standing pretrial order issued on February 26, 1988. \nUnder that order, department clinicians were to conduct clinical evaluations of each JRC patient and prepare a report which was to \n \nbe forwarded to all parties. The department had previously named a psychologist as the department clinician who was slated to \nprovide an independent evaluation of Brandon; by the fifth day of testimony, however, no report had been submitted. Thus, when \nthe department moved to submit the report, the judge refused to admit the report at that late stage of the trial. \nWe note that, while the department does not address the issue, it appears that the judge was well within his discretion in refusing \nto allow the report in evidence because the department violated a previous order of the court in failing promptly to give copies of \n  8 \n \n\n \n \nthe report to all parties. Cf. Mass. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(b), 365 Mass. 797 (1965) (appropriate sanction for failing to comply with \ndiscovery order is exclusion of designated matters). \n \n19  The judge stated that he was “a bit concerned with the format of an offer of proof. It’s been my understanding that an offer of proof \nwould allow for the report to be read into the record and I’m not going to allow that to happen. An offer of proof being something \n \nthat this particular witness would, his testimony would be, if allowed to testify or the report I suppose speaks for itself. So [on] \ntechnical grounds I’m going to accept it as an offer of proof. I will file it. So it will be in the file. If at the [a]ppellate level it needs \nto be addressed on a remand, if that should happen, the [c]ourt has the report in the file. But I’m not treating it technically as an \noffer of proof.” \n \n20  In his findings of fact and conclusions of law, the judge stated that “the [d]epartment improperly attempted to submit a hearsay \nreport to the [c]ourt.” Moreover, the judge found that “the [c]ourt, several times during the course of the proceedings, inquired of \n \nboth counsel [for Brandon] and counsel for the [department] as to where their alternative treatment plan was. Both counsel ... \nsubmitted alternative treatment plans on the last day of testimony after the luncheon recess. The [department’s] plan was \nhandwritten on yellow paper and counsel for [Brandon] submitted a typed plan. This was only done after the [c]ourt ordered \ncounsel to produce such plans on the last day of hearings.” \n \n21  The judge also stated that the department’s conduct in this case “was improper and resulted in an unnecessarily prolonged \nproceeding. [The department] presented duplicative testimony from witnesses who had limited or incomplete information \n \nconcerning [Brandon].” \n \n22  We note also that while the judge indicated that the report would be “in the file” we can find no evidence of the report in the record \nappendix. It is each party’s responsibility to ensure that material necessary to its appeal is included in the appendix. Mass. R.A.P. \n \n18(a), as amended, 409 Mass. 1602 (1991). The index to the record appendix lists almost one hundred documents contained therein \nonly by exhibit number, but nowhere in their briefs does the department or counsel for Brandon reference the report by exhibit \nnumber. References in the briefs to parts of the record reproduced in an appendix shall be to the pages of the appendix at which \nthose parts appear, Mass. R.A.P. 16(e), as amended, 378 Mass. 940 (1979). Absent such a reference we are unwilling to search for \nthe document and conclude that the report is not part of the record appendix. Moreover, we note that exhibits are to be suitably \nindexed, Mass. R.A.P. 18(e), as amended, 392 Mass. 1106 (1984), and where, as here, the exhibits encompass approximately 1,000 \npages and the portions of the transcript reproduced also encompass almost 1,000 pages, merely indexing exhibits by number is not \nhelpful. \n \n23  While the department also argues that it offered the report as an alternative treatment plan, they make no argument regarding why \nthe report should have been accepted as such other than to state that the psychologist who authored the report would have testified \n \nas to alternative treatments for Brandon. In any event, the judge did accept alternative treatment plans from the department and \ncounsel for Brandon on the last day of trial after repeatedly inquiring of the two parties where their alternative treatment plans \nwere. Thus, neither party can show that any prejudice results from the failure of the judge to accept the report as an alternative \ntreatment plan. \n \n24  The department, JRC, and counsel for Brandon, however, agreed that the psychiatrist and another witness would each submit a \nreport on Brandon and be cross-examined but that there would be no direct examination of the witness. \n \n \n25  The judge clearly recognized that certification of JRC’s program was necessary to his approval of JRC’s proposed treatment plan, \nfor he specifically stated that “JRC is certified by the Department of Mental Retardation to utilize the GED-4.” In addition, the \n \njudge noted that there had been testimony that the plan proposed by JRC was “the most effective, least restrictive plan available for \nBrandon.” \n \n26  We note that, in the instant case, in denying the motion for reconsideration, the judge stated that “the [d]epartment cannot by \nimplementation of its certification process subvert ... the jurisdiction of the [c]ourt to render substituted judgment determinations \n \non a case by case basis.” \n \n27  JRC moved to supplement the record appendix pursuant to Mass. R.A.P. 18, as amended, 417 Mass. 1602 (1994). The department \nand counsel for Brandon moved to strike the supplemental appendix filed by JRC which contained the letter sent by the receiver to \n \nJRC rescinding the letter of January 20, 1995. JRC’s motion is allowed; the motion of the department and counsel for Brandon is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n  \n  9 \n ",

Their  ill-\nness  is  commonly  characterized by  aberr,ant behavior,  including \nviolence  toward others,  self-abuse,  destruction  of property,  danger \nto  themselves  and others  and,  in short,  behavior that is so  abnormal \nthat  it is  in many  cases  life-threatening by  nature. \n-1-\n\n------- -- ..... ---....- -.--.... \n1.  These  parties  first appeared before  this  Court  in \nDec~er, 1985,  when  Behavior Research  Institute,  Inc.  (BRI) \nand  the parents  of Janine  C. ,  a  student at BRI,  petitioned  the \nProbate  and  Family Court of Bristol  County  for  the  issuance  of \nguardianship and  substituted judgment orders  returning Janine \nC.  to  the  treatment program which  had been  abruptly  terminated \nby  the  order of  the Office  For Children  (OFC)  of  September  26, \n1985,  and  whose  condition  had  deteriorated  to  the  extent of being \nlife-threatening.  In Re:  Janine C.,  ·8SP  2137-Gl.  On  December  18, \n1985,  this  Court  issued a  guardianship  and  substituted  judgment \ndetermination,  with  the  a·greement of all  parties,  including  the \nOFC,  which was  represented by  the  Department of  the Attorney \nGeneral.  Under  this  agreement,  Janine  C. 's  previous  treatment \nprogram,  including physical  aversives  and  contingent food,  was \nresumed. \n2.  As  a  result of  the  resumption  of  treatment ordered by \nthe Bristol  Probate Court  through  the  guardianship  and  substituted \njudgment  proceedings,  Janine C.  increased  her  self-care,  academic, \neducational  and work  skills.  Janine also made  rapid progress  in \neliminating her self-abusive and  injurious behaviors.  Due  to  the \nProbate  and  Family Court's  Order  of December  18,  1985,  the  serious \nregression  and behavior of  Janine C.  was  abruptly halted,  and  the \nquality of  her  life dramatically improved. \n3.  On  January 22,  1986,  BRI  and  five  parents  of  students \nat BRI  filed  guardianship  and  substituted  judgment proceedings \nin the  Bristol  Probate  Court.  In Re:  Wayne  M.,  86P  0192-Gli \n-2-\n\n---- -----------\nIn Re:  Abby'·.G.,  86P  0195-Gl;  In Re:  Brett L.  86P  0211-Gl; \nI \nIn Re:  Brendon S.,  86P  0193-Gl;  and In Re:  Michael  S.,  86P  0194-Gl . \nThe  guardianship  and  substituted  judgment  petitions  sought  resump-\ntion of the program as  it existed prior to September  26,  1985, \nfor  these  five  students.  Even  though  OFC  had  agreed  that treat-\nment  could  resume  for  Janine C.,  and even  though  Janine C.  had \ndramatically improved  as  a  result of  the  resumption  of treatment, \nOFC  now  refused to agree  that any  of  the five  students  could \nbe  returned to  treatment.  This  refusal  was  never  explained.by \nOFC,  even  though  all  five  students  had  severely regressed  in \ntheir self-abusive,  aggressive  and  destructive behaviors  after \nthe September  26,  1985,  Order  of  OFC  prohibiting physical  aversive \ntherapies  and  contingent  food  reward therapies.  For  some  of \nthese  students,  the regression had  become  life-threatening. \n4.  On  January  31,  1986,  the  Probate  and  Family  Court  entered \nguardianship  and  substituted  judgment  orders  returning the  five \nstudents  to a  program which  included physical  aversives,  contin-\ngent food  rewards,  and  in one  case also  a  restrained-time-out \nprocedure  known  as Automatic Vapor  Spray  (AVS)..  In making  deter-\nminations  of  guardianship  and  substituted  judgment the Court \nviewed  video  tapes which  were  admitted  into evidence  and  clearly \nrevealed the contrast between  the anguished,  frenzied  and violent \nbehavior of the ward  at the time  of  admission  to the  Behavior \nResearch  Institute,  and then the normalized,  contented,  smiling and \nnonviolent d~r following  treatment  and,  finally,  the  substantial \ndeterioration to  the  ward's  former  anguished  condition when  the \n-3-\n\ntreatment was  proscr~bed by the order entered by  the  Office For \nChildren  on September  26,  1985.  The Court  additionally took \nviews  at BRr  and  heard detailed testimony  concerning  the unique \ncircumstances  of each particular student,  as  well  as  made  detailed \nfindings  in each  case. \nS.  Not  one  scintilla of  affirmative  evidence was  offered \nat these  guardianship  hearings  by  the OFC,  even  though the  agency \nwas  requested by ,the Court to  produce  any  reasonable  available \nalternative or  less  intrusive treatment  that might be  adopted. \n6.  Since  the  Probate and Family  Court  Orders  of January  31, \n1986,  and  the  resumption  of physical  aversives,  contingent food \nand  restrained-time-out programs,  the  five  students  have  substan-\ntially improved.  The  self-abuse,  violence,  aggression and  des-\ntructive  behavior  of  the  five  students,  as  well  as  other  life-\nthreatening behaviors,  have decreased while their self-care and \nacademic  skills have  increased.  The  quality of  life for  the \nfive  students has  improved  due  to  the  January  31,  1986,  Orders \nof the  Probate and  Family  Court. \n7.  On  February  7,  1986,  the Department  of  the  Attorney \nGeneral,  on  behalf of  OFC,  petitioned the Probate and Family Court \nfor  a  stay of the guardianship  substituted  judgment orders,  pre-\nsenting the claim that the provision in the  substituted  judgment \norders  allowing  physical  aversives  and  contingent food was  illegal \nbecause  the Emergency  Order to Correct Deficiencies,  issued by \nthe OFC  on  September  26,  1985,  banned  these  therapies.  The \nProbate  Court denied  this motion  for a  stay on  February 24,  1986. \n-4-\n\n---\n---------------~~----.--.-.-.--.----... \n8.  The  OFC  appealed  the denial  of  its motion  for  a  stay on \nthe  guardianship and substituted judgment  orders  to  the Massa-\nchusetts Appeals  Court.  On  'March 5,  1986,  after a  full  hearing, \na  Single  Justice of  the  Appeals  Court 9-enied  the OFe  appeal,  up-\nholding  the Probate  Court  ~~ardianship and  substituted  judgment \norders. \n9.  The  Single Justice of  the  Appeals  Court,  in upholding \nthis  Court's  actions,  admonished  all  parties  in effect that they \nshared a  common  responsibility and  duty  to  go  back  to  the  lower \ncourt and  with  the  judge's' assistance  put  in place  a  mechanism \nto  resolve  this  litigation and  settle this  matter  in  the best \ninterests  of  the  students. \n10.  In  accordance with  the  appellate  direction  given  to \nthis  Court,  on  or  about  March  7,  1986,  a  conference  of all parties \nwas  convened by  the  judge  in  the  Probate  and  Family  Court Depart-\nment  for  Bristol County  at Attleboro  in order  to  address  the \nemergency  treatment needs  of  some  eighteen  students  at BRI,  in \nlight of  the September  26,  1985,  Orders  of  the Massachusetts \nOffice For Children. and  the  recently filed  class  action complaint \nfor  equitable  relief. \n11.  At  this  conference  the  Court  specifically detailed  the \nphilosop:tfy  of  a  fair  and  competent  settlement process,  which  had \nto be  grounded  in  the  good  faith of  all parties being  committed \nand willing to  establish a  settlement dialogue,  in  effect,  a \ntreatment  dialogue. \n12.  The  Court  specifically elicited from  each party an \nacknowledgement  and  a  commitment  that each would enter the  process \n-5-\n\n- -------------------:-:c--'-, -, ----'.:- -\nin good  faith;  the  parties did  so,  and  also  acknowledged  that \nthe  affected  students were  in  a  state of  emergency. \n13.  On  this  date of March  7,  1986,  the  parties  entered  into \nan  agreement.  Pursuant  to  that agreement,  a  nteam\"  \\vas  ass6.l..'lbled \nto  assess  and  evaluate  the  treatment plans  for  eighteen of  the \nmost handicapped  students  then  enrolled in  the BRI  program.  The \nnteam\"  \\-las  to  include  representatives  of  the  Office For Children, \nthe  Department of Education,  the Department .of Mental  Health  and \nthe  Department of Social  Services.  The  parents  also  designated a \nn\nrepresentative to  the  \"team .  James  A.  Casey,  the  Chief  Proba-\ntion  Officer of  the Bristol Probate and  Family Court,  was  appointed \nChairman  of  the  \"team\"  on  a  temporary  basis. \nThe  Agreement  also  stated,  inter alia,  that: \nnIt is  the  intention of  the  parties  to negotiate \nin  good  faith  and to  act in  the  best interests \nof  the  children of BRI.\" \nIn  fact,  such  representations  were made  by  the parties  to  the, \nCourt. \n14.  It was  understood and  expressly agreed between  the \nparties  that the  \"team\"  would  have  full  authority to  design  treat-\nment pla~s for eighteen BRI  students  and  that the  \"team's\"  authority \nwould  not be  affected by  the  \"variance\"  decision pending before \ndefendant Leonard,  or by  the  report of the  OFC  Advisory Panel~ \n15.  The  \"team\"  deSigned  new  treatment  programs  for  the \nstudents Vincent M.,  Abby  G.,  Johri  C.,  Heather S./  Brett L., \nMartin A.,  Philip D.  and  Stephen G.,  which  included,  in some  cases, \na  contingent food  program,  physical  aversives  and  a  modified \n-6-\n\n_--\n_..   - •..... ---- -----.-.. ----------------------~ \nautomatic  vapor  spray procedure.  All  of the  \"team's \"  decisions \nwere  by  unanimous  v.ote.  The  team's members  included  a  clinical \npsychologist,  Dr.  Myrna  Libby;  an  educational  specialist,  Dr. \nEdward Mitton;  and Bette McClure,  an  OFC  supervisory  employee. \nAccording  to  the  testimony of  the  court-appointed expert,  as well \nas  the  testimony of  the  \"team's\"  temporary  chairman,  Mr.  James \nCasey,  the  \"team\"  was  effectively addressing  the  clinical needs \nof  BRI  students. \n16.  On  April  24,  1986,  the Defendant  Leonard  issued deci-\nsions  concerning BRI's  application  for  variances,  concerning  the \nrelicensing of  BRI  and  concerning  the  resumption  of  intake of \nnew  students  at BRI. \n17.  The  April  24,  1986,  decisions  in  effect would  terminate \nthe  treatment plans  as  used by BRI . \n..l.8.  As  part of  the  OFC  Decisions,  the  Defendant  Leonard \npurported  to agree  to  continue with  the  \"team\"  process;  however, \nthe  \"team\"  was  to be  restricted in  its choice  of  treatment pro-\ngrams  for ERI  students  by  the.OFC  Decisions  of Defendant Leonard. \nSpecifically,  the  nteam\"  was  prohibited from  designing  a  treat-\nment program which included contingent  food,  physical  aversives, \nthe  automatic vapor  spray  station or any of  its modifications  and, \nin  addition,  was  precluded £rom  designing a  treatment program \nwhich  included water vapor  aversives,  helmets,  taste  aversives, \nor  certain other procedures  used  in the  BRI  program.  Within \nforty-five  days  of the Decisions,  BRI  would  be  permitted by  OFe \nto  use  only  the  following  aversives:  \"ignore\",  \"no\"  and  \"token \n-7-\n\n------_._----_._--_ _---- ------------------ --\n.. \nfines\".  The  defendant' s  actions were  completely inconsistent \nand  contrary to  OFC  commitments  made  in  the agreement of March  7, \n1986. \n19.  Throughout  all  of the  aforesaid proceedings,  the  Court's \ngoal  has  been  to  identify and  put in place  competent  care  and \ntreatment  for  the BRr  students  and  to  restore  for  them  an  orderly \nprocess  so  that  their day  to  day  lives would  transpire  in  a  safe, \nuseful  and  effective fashion,  leading ,to  productive  lives. \nrather  than being placed in human  warehousing. \n20.  In view  of  the  emergency  nature  of  the  needs  of  the \nstudents,  and  the  excruciatingly  detailed  judicial  processes \nrequired  to meet  those  needs,  the  Court  relied upon  the  parties' \nacknowledgement of  good  faith activity and  their undivided  and \ncollective  commitment  to  the  settlement process. \n21.  NOw,  however,  events  have  transpired such  that this \nCourt  is ·now  obliged  to  consider whether or not  there has  indeed \nbeen  a  good  faith effort by these  parties  to  follow  the  direction \ncharted by  this  Court  and  the  Appellate Justice. \n~2.  Accordingly,  after four  extended  days  of  hearing,  close \nto  forty hours  of  testimon~ and  after scrutiny by  this  craurt of \nthe  credibility of  the  witnesses,  whom  he  personally observed \nin  the  giving of  their  testimony,  the  Court makes  the  following \nfindings,  which  are  specifically addressed  to  the  issues  o~ pre-\nliminary injunctive  relief with  the understanding that the merits \nwill  be  ful ly addressed  at further hearings. \n-8-\n\n---------- -------------------------- - ---------\n-\n~.- .:  -'.' \nFINDINGS  OF  FACT \n23.  The  Court finds  that these  students,  who  number  approxi-\nmately  62,  are  severely handicapped  persons  in need  of constant \nsupervision who  reside  in Behavior Research  Institute,  Inc. 's \ngroup  homes  in Bristol  County  and  attend the  institute's school \nfacility in Providence ,  aI.ld are aOmitted\" to BRI  from  several  juris-\ndictions,  including Delaware,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  Maryland  and \nMassachusetts.  They  average  twenty  years  of  age  and  share  the \ncommon  feature  that they have  typically,  on  the  average,  been \nrejected or ejected from  at least four  prior facilities  within \ntheir home  jurisdictions. \n24.  The  Court  finds  that their prior  care  and  treatment  have \ngenerally  fe~ture~the use  of behavioral  therapy consisting of \npositive  reinforcement or rewards,  and  commonly  substantia! \namounts  of  antipsychotic medication  and  physical  restraint.  The \nstudents'  rejection or ejection from  their prior placements \ndemonstrates  the  testimony in these  proceedings  that such  treat-\nment methods  have  utterly failed  to ameliorate  the violence  of \ntheir behavior. \n25.  The  Court  finds  the witness  Dr.  J.  L.  Matson  to  be  one \nof  the  foremost  psychologists  in  the United States,  well  versed \nin  the matters under  review whose  testimony  stands  unrefuted by \nJ \nany  competent or credible witness. \n26.  The  Court finds  that Dr.  Matson's  qualifications  include \nspecific  full-time  experience over  eleven years  in clinical  psy-\nchology  and  behavior modification,  designing hu~dreds of  treatment \nprograms  for developmentally disabled  individuals .  In  addition, \n-9-\n\n-------------------------------~~-----~~---------\nhe  has  authored over two  hundred  publications  in  reviewed  journals; \n'approximately fifteen books,  either published or  in process  thereof; \napproximately  thirty chapters  in medical  texts  in his  field.  He \nwill  present the  keynote  address  this  year  in Washington  at the \nArrLerican  Psychological  Association  annual  meeting.  He  has  served \nas  consultant in  this  country and abroad,  including consultant \nto  the  U.  S.  Justice Department on  issues  of Right  to  Care  and \nRight  to  Treatment.  He  has  lectured by  invitation at  academic \nand  professional  societies  and  organizations  internationally;  he \nholds  professional  and  academic  degrees  and  appoint~ents; his \nforensic  experience  is  substantial  and  includes  a  major Alabama \ncase  involving right to  treatment for  developmentally  disadvan-\n_taged  individuals.  He  has  personally visited and  inspected \nfacilities  for  care  and  treatment of  such  individuals  internation-\nally,  including  such  facilities within  every  geographical  region \nwithin  the  United  States;  he  served as  consultant in  the  develop-\nment  of  the Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual  III. \n27.  The  Court  finds  that Dr.  Matson' s  knowledge  and  experi-\nence  of ERI  and  its students  includes  two  consecutive  days  of \ninvestigation at the  BRI  school  and  group home  facilities,  during \nwhich he  examined  student records ona ran,dom  basis,  both  generally \nand  specifically;  obServed  the monitoring systems;  observed  the \nresidents  and  spoke with  those  capable  of  speaking;  spoke  with \nparents,  staff and  administration.  No  limitations whatsoever \nwere  placed upon  him  in  regard  to his  investigation of  the \nfacil ities.  He  read materials,  including  the  defendant's  Decisions, \nthe Panel  Report upon which  she  relied;  ERI  admissions  policy;  and \n-10-\n\nits treatment policies  and procedures. \n28.  The  ~ourt finds  Dr.  J.  L.  Matson  qualified  to  serve \nas  an  expert witness  in these  proceedings. \n29.  The  Court  further  finds  that although  Dr.  Matson  t esti-\nfied  as  a  witness  for  the plaintiffs over  the  objection of \ndefendant's  counsel;  Dr._ Matson's  expertise had  been  earlier \nrecognized by  defendant's  counsel,  who  had  suggested  that he  be \ninvited  to  serve  as  court-appointed  expert in  this very  case. \n30.  The  Court  finds  that  the  students  of BRI  are much  more \nimpaired  than  students  at other  institutions,  and  there  is  no \nother facility within  the  United States  that is willing or capable \nof  assuming competent  care of  individuals  as  grievously afflicted \nas  the  student populat.ion  of BRI.  There  is no  other  program  known \nto Dr.  Matson  that has  an  open-door  admission  policy  of  accepting \nsuch  students,  regardless  of  the  severity of  their behavior. \n31.  The  Court  finds  that other programs  tend  to  be  designed \nfor  student populations  that are  substantially younger and  l ess \ngrievously  afflicted than  the  BRI  student population.  Professional \nliterature and  experience  tend  to  be  directed  toward  that younger \npopulation.  Unfortunately,  the  BRI  students  are  those who  have \nfailed  to  respond  to  those more  commonly  available modes  of  treat-\nment.  Without  the  unique  program  at BRII  such  students  are \ntypically  served in  far more  restrictive facil.ities,·dilhich  depend \nupon  exceedingly high  doses  of  antipsychotics,  physical  restraint, \nand  seclusion for days  at a  time an  environment of  empty  rooms, \nl \nlocked wards  and,  oftentimes,  a  staffing ratio of  one  high  school \neducated  attendant per twenty  or thirty residents. \n-11-\n\n-.•.. -... ---.. -----.-~.. -  ------------~~-----\n32.  The  Court  finds  that the  nature  and  quality of  care  and \ntreatment  that ERr  provides  to  its special  class  of  students  is \nvastly superior  to  any  other known  program  for  this  particular \npopula.tion. \n33.  The  Court  finds  that the quality of  the  interaction \nbetween  the  students  and  their direct care  staff and  staff super-\nvision  is  superior;  staff  training is vastly superior.  ERr' s \nnovel  staff reward program  is  unique  and  not  even possible in.a \nstate  facility;  record  keeping  is extraordinarily good;  and  there \nis  no  other known  program  employing video monitoring.  There \n~re adequate  and  appropriate  safeguards  over  the  rights,  interests \nand  safety of  the  ERr  students . \n. 34.  The  Court finds  that  the  physical  plant is  outstanding \nand  the  quality and  habitability of  the  group  homes  rank  as  vastly \nsuperior,  given  the  severity of  the  population.  The  fact  that \nBRI  is  able  to maintain  this  population in  such  a  normalized \ngroup  home  environment  in turn  i s  conducive  to  staff quality.  The \nsimple  fact  that one  student has  his  own  t.v.  is quite  remarkable. \nThe  staff-to-student ratio at BRr  is  remarkably  high,  at times \nexceeding  one  to  one. \n35.  The  Court finds  that BRr  has  been  serving  developmentally \ndisadvantaged  individuals  since  1975,  and  applied for  its first \nlicense from  the !4assachusetts  Office  for  Child'ren  in 1977. \n36.  The  Court finds  that the  education  and  treatment program \nprovided by BRI  since its inception has  employed  a  variety of behavior \nmanagement  techniques,  including  the  use  of  rewards  to encourage \n-12-\n\n--------- -----\nprogress  toward  education and  treatment goals.  Given  the extreme \nlevels  of  aggressive,  self-destructive and  other  inappropriate \nbehavior  exhibited by  the  students,  BRI  has  also employed  certain \naversive  techniques  since its inception.  The  aversive  techniques \nemployed  by BRI  to  decrease  student aggressiveness,  self-\ndestructiveness  and  other inappropriate behavior  consist of  the \napplication of  stimulation that BRI  students will  seek  to avoid, \nsuch  as  water  sprays,  taste aversives  and  muscle  squeezes.  BRI \nemploys  these  aversive  techniques  not  as  a  pu~ishment, but as \npart of  a  systematic  behavior modification  program. \n37:  The  Court  finds  that BRI  employs  aversive  techniques \nin  lieu of  antipsychotic medication  and  other more  restrictive \npr~cedures, such  as  seclusion and  painful  electric-shock.  BRI' s \ntreatment modalities  have  been  very  effective in that students \n(who  have  been  unsuccessfully  treated in more  restrictive settings \nthan BRI)  have  made  significant improvement  in their behavior, \neducational  skil~s and  self-care skills. \n38.  The  Court  finds  that in all  instances  the BRI  program, \nby  definition,  requires  that rewards  outnumber  any  aversive tech-\nnique  by  a  ratio of  ten or  fifteen to  one.  The  program  in this \nregard  is very  sophisticated and effective ,  and  remarkable  in \nthat the  behavior  of  the  students  can be  so violent that  it is  im-\npossible to use  reward  or positive reinforcement unless  the violent \nbehavior  can  be  controlled and  decelerated,  something other programs \nhave  typically  failed to do  for  these  students.  In other words,  the \nBRI  program for  these  students makes  it possible to make  positive \n-13-\n\n-.--.----.. -------------,-----~ \nreinforcement  a  meaningful  and  effective  treatment technique_ \n39.  The  Court  finds  that  the  characterization of  this  program \nas  one  of  punishments  is  a  misrepresentation..  Aversives  are only \nused  to decelerate  targeted behaviors  and  by  definition  the  aver-\nsives  decelerate  as  the behaviors  decelerate.  There  are  students \natBRI whose  treatments,  begun  with  aversives,  are  now  substantially \nfree  from  aversives,  consisting.of  rewards  and  positive reinforce-\nment.  At  all  times,  use  of  aversives  is  only  a  fraction of  the \ntotal  program,.~or at all  tL~es,  for  every  student,  there are \nconstant demonstrations  of  affection,  approval  and  rewards. \n40.  The  Court  finds  that  the  aversive  techniques  and  pro-\ncedures  used  at ERI  are  consistent with  professional  practice. \n41.  The  Court  finds  that Dr.  Matson  specifically observed \nthose  students  who  have been returned  to  treatment by  order  of \nthis Court  and  noted  that th~ child Janine,  for  example,  not only \nconversed with  him,  but hugged  him  and  told him  that she  liked \nbeing  there,  behavior  he  j udged  unlikely from  an  abused  or dis-\ntressed individual. \n42.  The  Court notes  that  this  is  the  same  fifteen-year-old \nchild who,  when  first observed by this  Court,  was  incoherent and \nhad mutilated herself  to  a  life-threatening degree  as  a  result \nof  the  cessation of her  treatment following  the  September 26,  1985, \nOFC  order.  On  a  follow-up view,  after her  treatment was  restored, \nthis  Judge  also was  greeted and  hugged  by  this  formerly  desperate \nchild.  This  is an  experience  this  Judge will  carry with hirnfor \nthe  rest of his  l ife.  It is significant to  note  that the defendant \n-14-\n\n..- ....... _------------------------_. \nin these proceedings  has  never herself met  this  child or any of \nthe  oL,ers  whose  lives she affects with  the  stroke of a  pen. \n43.·  The  Court  finds  that all  the  students who  have  been  re-\nstored  to  treatment  by order of  this Court  following  the  abrupt \ntermination of  their  treatment by  the  September  26,  1985  order \nof  the  defendant  and  the  deterioration  in  their condition  caused \nby  that  intrusion,  have  substantially improved  in their behavior and \nresumed  their education  and  self-care,  50  that the  quality of  their \nlives  has  been  improved.  This  improvement  is  so basic  and  essen-\ntial  to  them  that it literally involves  their opportunity  to \nenjoy blessings of humanity that other individuals  are  likely to \ntake for  granted.  One  such student's  life,  for  example,  without \ntreatment,  required .imposition of  four-point  restraint to  p~event \nhim  from  tearing  and  lacerating his  own  prolapsed i?testines. \nWith  treatment,  this  young man  enjoys  the ·~imple pleasure  of  going \nto  a  restaurant;  the  simple.pleasure of meaningful  communication \nwith another human  being;  the  simple  satisfaction of  completing \na  meaningful  task;  the  dignity of  the  achiev~~ent of  basic  self-\ncare  skills.  These  are  typical  of  the  benefits derived by  these \nstudents  as  a  consequence of  their BRI  program. \n44.  The  Court  finds  that  the  defendant,  Mary Kay  Leonard, \nis  the  Director of The  Office For Children,  a  Massachusetts  agency \nwithin  the Executive  Office of  Human  Services, .whose  duties  arise \nunder  the  provisions  of Massachusetts  General  Laws,  Chapter 28A. \nShe  is  responsible  for implementing  all  policies  of  the Office \nFor Children,  in particular for  issuing group  care  licenses  to \nfacilities  such  as  BRI. \n-15-\n\n-------------------~-----'~.-.-.-.. ------ ----------------------,:. \nf' \n, 45.  The  Court finds  that  the defendant,  by her  testimony, \nis  solely responsible  for  the  decisions  of  her  agency  at  issue \nin ,this litigation. \n46.  The  Court  finds  that on  September  26,  1985,  the  defen-\ndant  issued orders  that,  among  other  things,  attenuated the modes \nof  treatment available to  the  students  at BRr  by  abruptly  termin-\nating the  use  of  any  physical  aversives  and  contingent food  programs. \nThe  school  was  also prohibited from  admitting any  further  students. \n47.  The  Court finds  that on April  24,  1986,  the  defendant \ni s sued  decisions  which  in  effect further  reduce modes  of  treatment \nto  such  a  degree  that the  BRI  program became  an  empty  shell  for \nthose  students  who  require aversives  as  part of  their  treatment. \n48.  The  Court finds .that these  decisions  of  the  defendant \nare,  in effect,  treatment  decisions. \nThe  Court adopts  Dr.  Matson' s  Cand  other witnesses' ) \nvie,vs  and  finds  that the  consequences  of  t hese  treatment  deci-\nsions  by  the defendant  are  as  follows: \nA.  The  students will  deteriorate such that self-\nabuse,  violence,  destruction,  aggression and  all  aberrant  behaviors \nwill  increase. \nB.  There  is substantial  danger  that affective modes \nof  treatment abruptly terminated,  even  if restored,  may  never \nwork  again. \nC.  Students will  lose education  opportunities  and \nadvancements;  self-care skills,  quality of  life;  and  there is \nsubstantial  danger  that these  benefits will  never be  restored \nor achieved. \n-16-\n\n- - - --- - ----------------\n---~-------\"\"\"--\"\"----- \"\"--\"-------.--\"\"\" \nD.  Students wil l  lose or fa\"il  to  dev~lop verbal  skills. \nE.  Students will  lose  their opportunity  to  graduate \ninto  less  restrictive environments. \nF.  Caretakers  of  the  students,  faced with  the  escala-\ntion  of  life-threatening behavior,  will be obliged  to  resort  to \nphysical  restraint,  seclusion,  antipsychotic medications,  or \nother chemical  restraints.  (BRI  never uses  antipsychotic medi-\ncations  to  restrain. its students. ) \nG.  The  normalized  environment  of  the  school  facility \nand  the  group  homes  will  of necessity be  disrupted and  stripped \nof amenities_ \nH.  Danger  of physical  assault  and  injury to  staff \nand  fel low  students will  increase.  (Already  there  has  been  a \nfour-fold  increase  in  injury to  staff.) \nI .  Staff  time  otherwise  devoted  to  all  the  positive \naspects  of  the  program will  be  distracted  and  consumed by  the \nneed  to  restrain and  control  dangerous  behaviors . \n. J.  Parents  of  the  students will  suffer  the  cqnse-\nquences  of all  of  the  aforesaid  circumstances,  and  these  conse-\nquences  will  be manifest by  increased marital  and  personal  stress, \nincreased divorce  rates,  and  the  loss of positive expectations \nin their children's  behalf. \nK.  Work ·skills  of  the  students  will  deteriorate  further. \nL.  A  1983  follow-up  study of  students who  have· graduated \nfrom  BRI  revealed  that seventy-five percent had become  capable  of \nliving in  less  restrictive  settings,  once  they  had  completed  their \ncourse  at BRI.  Stripped of  its  program,  BRI  will  no  longer  achieve \n-17-\n\nsuch  results for  its graduates.  If BRI  were  no  longer  available, \nthese  students would  for  the most part be  transferred  to  state \ni \nI' \nhospitals  or state  developmental  centers  substantially more  i \nrestrictive  than  the BRI  envirorunent  and  sometimes  called  I~warehousirig\" . \n49.  The  Court  finds  that there  is  substantial  evidence \nthat all  of  the  aforesaid deterioration has  occurred already as  a  i. \n; \nI \nI· \nconsequence  of  the  September  26,  1985 ·orders .. \n50.  The  Court appOinted  Dr.  John  Daignault as  Guardian  ad \nLitem for  the specific purpose  of  investigating and  reporting  to \nthe  Court  as  follows: \n\"For  the  purpose  of making  a  preliminary eValua-\ntion of  the  clinical  needs  of  the Behavior Research \nInstitute,  Inc.,  students  and  the  effect of  the \ndefendant Mary  Kay  Leonard's  orders  of September  26, \n1985,  and  April  23,  1986,  upon  their  status.  Said \nevaluation shall  consider  the  relationship be-\ntween  such orders and  any  regression  of  the \nBehavior Research Institute students  including \nany  life-threatening behavior,  violence,  self-\nabuse,  loss  of self-care skills or loss  of  educa-\ntional  opportunity.  The  evaluation  shall  focus \nprimarily on  those  students who  are  now  under \ntemporary  guardianship  under  the  jurisdiction \nof this  Court  and  shall  apply  only  generally and \nas  is possible  to the  remaining students. \" \n(See  Appointment of. Guardian ad Litem dated May  1,  1986.) \n51.  The  Court finds  Dr.  Daignault  to  be  fully qualified \nas  an expert for  these matters,  with  commendable background  and \nexperience,  including  the  fact  that he  holds  degrees  in psychology, \nhas  both  clinical  and  academic  experience  in the  treatment of \ndevelopmentally disadvantaged  individuals  and  hOlds  appointments \nat McLean  Hospital,  Harvard Medical  School,  and  at Bridgewater \nState Hospital. \n- 18-\n\n----_. ---_._ _-_ _-------_._---------------------- -_._-_.... _ ----_._------..- -...-  ----.- .--! \n..  .. \n52 _  The  Court  finds  that the  scope  of Dr_  Daignault's  in-\nvestigation  of  these matters  included  review  of  the  defendant's \norders  and  decisions  of September  26,  1985  and April  24,  1986; \nvisits to  the BRI  premises May  7,  8  and  9,  1986;  clinical  examina-\ntion of all  students  being  treated under  purview  of  this Court's \norders;  review  of  current  treatment programs;  review  of behavioral \ndata  charts  at selected points,  namely,  the baseline  data at \ntime  of admission;  at six-month points;  and the weekly data  from \nJanuarYt  1985,  through April,  1986.  Dr.  Daignault focused  his \nattention upon  behaviors  currently being  treated by  any  aversive \nthat would  be  eliminated by  implementation  of  the  defendant's \norders.  He  revie\\ved  the  students'  psychological  and  psychiatric \nevaluations; interviewed  administration,  teachers  and  direct care \nstaff;  reviewed  the  report of  the  Panel  upon which  the  defendant \nhas  relied;  the work  of the  team established as  a  means  of  settle-\nment by this  Court;  and  spoke  with  a  member  of  that  team.  He \nalso  selected and  reviewed  at random  the  records  and  history of \na  student at BRI  not  yet specifically involved in guardianship. \n53.  The  Court finds  that the  current state of  treatment of \nstudents  at-BRr  is being  adversely affected by  the  lack of  col-\nlaboration of all  parties  inVOlved  in the  students'  treatment, \nbecause of  the  disruptive  interjection of  the  defendant into \nthe treatment processes. \n54.  The  Court  finds  that Dr.  Daignault developed his  in-\nvestigation  in a  detailed,  thorough  and  extremely systematic \nmanner,  and  he  articUlated his  findings  and  conclusions  in the \nsame  manner.  The  full  presentation of  his  testimony  to  this  Court \ncomprised  the  better part of  a  full  day. \n-19-\n\n...... \n----------------~-------------,~~~--~--~- ---.~----------j. \n55.  The  Court  summarizes,  finds  and  accepts  Dr.  Daignault's \nconclusions  as  follows: \nA  clinician who  assumes  the  responsibility of  the \ntreatment of  any  patient such  as  a  BRI  student must be  aware  of \nthe  enviroTh~ental factors  involved  in  the  patient's  status_  The \ncompetent  clinician must  consider  the  entire  range  of positive  re-\ninforCE:J.llent,  negative  reinforcement and  aversive  consequences  that \nactually occur  in  the  development of any  human  being.  There  are \npotentially negative side  effects  to any  treatments,  including \nthose  treatments  characterized as  positive  reinforcement.  All \nof  us  live  in  an  environment where we  are  constantly  subjected \nto both reinforcements  and  aversives.  At  BRI,  which  provides  a \nC9.ll?_istently  controlled  therapeutic environment where  all  posi-\ntive  reinforcements,  negative  reinforcements  and  aversive  con-\nsequences  are  carefully defined,  measured,  controlled and \ndocumented  so  that they may be  safely measured  out  and  employed \neffectively to  achieve  nothing but therapeutic  results,  the \ninstitute achieves  a  total  program of behavioral  psychology  that \neliminates  problem behaviors,  builds new  behaviors,  and  e~iminates \naltogether  the  dangerous  use  of antipsychotic medications  in the \nprocess.  The  ERI  program  has  been  effectively successful  for \neach  of  the  specific students  examined  and  reviewed by Dr.  Daignault. \nThe  effect of  the· defendant's' orders  and  decisions  is  to destroy \nthis  program. \n-20-\n\n:.\" \n56.  The  Court  finds  that Dr.  Daignault has  documented  the \nexistence  of the same  damaging and dangerous  consequences  that \nDr.  Matson  has  articulated to  be  a  direct  consequence  of the \ndefendant's  orders.  The  Court adopts  Dr.  Daignault's  conclusion \nthat  implementation of  defendant's  orders  will  cause  such  sub-\nstantial  regression that  the students will  eventually make  their \nway  to  less  comprehensive  state facilities where  restraint  and \nmedications  are employed  primarily for  management  purposes\", and \nnot for educative purposes. \n57.  The  Court  finds  that Dr.  Daignault's  examination of \nthe  present  condition of  the students  restored  to treatment \nunder  purview of  this Court was  exhaustive,  and  the Court  adopts \nas its finding his conclusion  in each  instance  that  the  condition \nof  each student was  substantially improved  as  a  consequence  of \nthe  restoration of  treatment. \n58.  The  Court  finds  that Dr.  Daignault made  an  examination \nof  the effectiveness  of  the work  of the  \"team\"  that restored \ntreatment  to  certain  students  under  purview  of  this  Court,  and \nthe  Court  adopts  as  its finding  his  conclusion  that the team \nhas  been highly effective as a  working  group  to  restore therapeutic-\nally effective treatment. \n59.  The  Court  finds  that no  competent  scientific basis \nexists  for  the treatment  limitations the defendant's  orders  and \ndecisions  have  imposed  upon  the  clinical  practice at BRI. \n60.  This  Court  finds  that Dr.  Matthew  Israel,  the Director  of  BRI, \nis  eminently qualifed  in  psychology and the clinical  practice  of  behav-\nioral  therapy,  both  through  his  academic  training'at Harvard  and  his \n-21-\n\nprofessional  experience;  and  that he \"ha\"s  devoted his. clinical practice \nfor more  than  a  decade  to  the \" care \"and  trea;tmerit of.  a  unique  and \ndesperately vulnerable population largely  ignored in the  ptofessional \nliterature and  in clinical pract~ce. \n61.  This  Court  finds  that Dr.  Isr.ael' s  test~mony ha~ been \ncorroborated by  the experts ~atson and D~~gnault and  is consistent \nin all substantial respects;  and  f.~rther,  that this body  of evidence \nhas  not been  refuted by  any  competent  or credible witness. \n62.  This  Court  finds  that Mr.  Leo  Soucy,  the parent representa-\ntive on  the  team,  corroborates that the  team process  was  effective \nin its approach  to  addressing  critical needs  of the  students whose \ntreatment  plans  came  under  its consideration. \n63.  This  Court  finds  that Dr.  Edward  Sassaman  serves  as \nmedical  aonsultant to  the  students  at BRI,  and  in fact follows \ntheir medical  care personally  on  a  weekly  basis.  His  qualifications \ninclude his medical education  at Harvard University  and his \ntraining  at Children's  Ho~pital.  His  appointments  in  addition \nto  BRI  include  an  academic  appointment  at Brown University Medical \nSchool.  It is his  professional opinion  that the health and  safety \nof the BRI  students has  been  adversely affected and  endangered by \nthe  actions  of the  defendant.  The \"Court  adopts  this  as  its \nfinding. \n64.  This  Court  finds  that Bette McClure  is the Director of  \" \nSubstitute Care  of the Licensing Program Of  the Office for \nChildren,  and  thus  administers  licensing authority for  all out \nof home  residential care,  In  this  capacity she was  directly \nresponsible  for the preparation and editing of the  Licensing \nRe-Study  dated August,  1985,  (plaintiffs'  exhibit #12).  It is \nincumbent  to  remember  that this  crucial exhibit is the  one \n-22-\n\nwherein  the word  \"DRA.FTft  ha!:!  been ~tamJ?ed on  every p?:ge,  as \nshall be  later observed. \n65.  This  Court  finds  that this report was  completed  somewhere \nbetween August  1  and August  31t  1985,  ~fte~ a  study of  some  nine \nmonths,  involving two  hundred  fifty hours  of examinat~on of BRI \nby Defendant's  employe~s,  and  this  report,  which  speaks  for \nitself,  is  laudatory to BRI  in all substantial respects  and \nsubstantially consistent with  the  expert testimony heard  by  this \nCourt  regarding the ·status of BRI  in August,  1985.  However,  with \nthis  laudatory  report  in hand,  twenty-si~ days  later the  Defendant \nentered an order terminating  the aversive  therapies  being  utilized \nby  BRI. \n66.  The  Court  finds  that BRI was  never  notified of this \nimpending,  devastating action prior to  its  announcement  at a \npress  conference  by  the  Defendant on  September  26,  1985. \n67.  The  Court  further  finds  that this  report had been \ndisseminated by  OFC,  its  agents,  servants,  employees  or its \nattorneys,  without  the word  \"DRAFT\"  stamped  thereon,  to  at least \ntwo  state agencies,  the  Department of Education and  the Executive \nOffice  for Human  Services. \n68.  The  Court finds  that it has  not been  and was  not  the \nusual  and  customary procedure  of the.~Defendant to dlhsseminate \nsuch  reports  to other  agencies  in draft form.  . \non \n69.  The  Court finds  that  October  I,  1985,·the Plaintiffs' \ncounsel made  a  demand  under  the state version of The  Freedom of \nInformation Act  to  the  deputy. gener~l counsel  of OFC  for  the \nproduction of the document  now  numbered  plaintiffs'  exhibit *12/ \n-23-\n\n~--------.---.-.. ------------------------------------\nand  it is  stipulated by  the parties and  found  by  this  Court  that \nsaid deputy  counsel  of  OFe  stamped  the word  \"DRAFT\"  on each  page \nof  this  instrument  on  October  2,  1985,  one  day  after plaintiffs \nmade  their request for  production.  The  significance of this \nevent becomes  obvious.  In  its original  form,  the  report  did \nnot  have  the  stamp  \"DRAFT\"  on  every page.  Indeed,  the  report \nhad  net been  stamped  \"DRAFT\"  by Ms.  McClure  or  any  of  the OFC' s \nlicensing staff.  Rather,  the  report was  stamped  \"DRAFT\"  by  Robert \nKubacki,  Deputy General  Counsel  of the OFC,  on  the day  that Mr. \nKubacki  received plaintiffs'  request.  This  fact was  not  disclosed \nto plaintiffs'  counsel. \n70.  The  Court  finds  that the action  of  the OFC  counsel  in \nstamping -the  August  1985  report  \"DRAFT\" 'was  highly  improper  and \nconstitutes  not only  a  recent  contrivance,  but  also a  deliberate \nattempt  to alter a  document  which  OFC  knew would  be  damaging  in \nlater proceedings.  This  conduct  by  a  state official constitutes \nbad  faith  by  the Office For  Children. \n71.  The  Court  finds  that  plaintiffs '  exhibit  #12  has  been \nsubstantially altered,  which alteration was  made  by an  employee  of \nthe  defendant after it was  delivered to  the Department  of  Education \nand  the  Executive Office  for Euman  Services.  The  thrust of  such \nalteration is to anticipate that  at some  future time  OFC  would \nnot  be compromised or  embarrassed  by  this  laudatory report. \n72.  The Court  asked  the  person who  made  this  alteration to \nappear and  explain the  reason  for this alteration.  The  Deputy \nGeneral  Counsel  never  appeared.  If  therefore,  find  that had  he \nappeared,  the Deputy  General  Counsel 's  testimony would  have \nbeen drunaging  to  the  defendant. \n-24-\n\n--------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------~-\n73.  The  Court  fi.nds -f;roID  the 'te-~-timony 0:1;  Bet:!te  McClure \nthat no  further written reports were  eyer made  or  received by \nher or the  Defendant  on  the subject of BRI  from  the da,te  of the \nAugust report  to  the date  of  the Defendant' s  Decision of \nSeptember  26,  1985. \n74.  The  Court  finds  that Bette McClure  was  the OFC's \nrepr~sentative and  participant  in the  \"team\"  initiated by  the \nCourt who  repeatedly voted with  the  \"teamn  to reinstitute \naversives  to  the  stUdents whose  cases we;re  reviewed.  Two \ndays  prior to  the Defendant's  April  24,  1986,  Order which  bans \naversives,  Bette McClure  voted  to restore  aversives  to  at least \ntwo  students,  Steven G.  and Heather  S.  By  her own  testimony  she \ndid this  for  two  reasons:  she  found  the  students had  regressed \nand  she  found  that all .appropriate questions  had been  asked  and \nanswered  regarding the  existing alternatives  for  these  children. \n75.  This  Court  finds  that  at the  time Bette McClure  voted  for  the \nrestoration of aversives  for these  two  students,  she knew  that the \narC \ndecision  of the  to ban  these  aversives had been made  and was \nabout t o  be  implemented~  She  voted to restore  treatment because \nit was  in the best interests of the children. \n76.  This  Court now  turn~ to  the  pivotal  area which  is decisive \non  the  issue of the preriminary  injunction.  We  m.ust  examine  the \nDefendant's  background,  experience  and  action taken during the \ncritical time with particularity_ \n77.  This  Court  finds  that the Defendant Mary  Kay  Leonard, \nr \nis an  attorney by  profession formerly General  Counsel  to another \nr \nstate ~gencYI who  possesRes  nQ  substantial education,  traini~g or \nexperience 'in the  fields  of- psychologyr  ~sychiatry, and  the \n-25-\n\n----------- ---------------------\n--\n:\"\"':\"'l\". \nbehavioral sciences.  She' became -the' -ni-:r:ector of OFe  on \nJuly 15,  1985.  She' was  -thris  thrust upon  the scene with -l,ittle \npreparation to  assume  the' myriad administrative duties  of  this \nagency.  On  July  22,  1985,  she  learned of  the  death  of a  BRI \nstudent and  an  investigation WaS  inaugurated.  She  took  no  formal \nadministrative  action  in August  of  1985  because  she  believed that \nBRI  was  acting within  the  scope  of its  license.  In  m~d September \nof 1985 phe  changed her mind{  although her September  26,  1985 \nf \nOrders  did not_ grow out of concerns  regarding  the  student's  death. \nThis  Ccurt can  thus  find  no  justi~ication for  the entry of  the \nSeptember  26,  1985  Order. -\n78.  The  Court  finds  that at some  point in time,  the  Defendant \nrealized that she  did not possess  suff-i-Cient  skills to rna-lee  treat-\nment  decisions  for  these  students,  and  also realized that she would \nhave  to some  day  explain  on what basis  she  had made  such \ndecisions. \n79.  The  Court  finds  that accordingly,  she  recruited a  panel, \nclaiming it was  her intention to  recruit a  group who  were  objective \nabout  (a)  the  use  of aversivesi  (b)  the  use of- aversIves  at BRIi \nand  (c)  Dr.  Matthew  Israel.  She  managed,  however,  to  recruit a \npanel  that was  the exact  antithesis  of her  claimed  intention. \nThe  composition of the  panel was  objected  to by both  BRI  and  the \nparents.  The  Defendant  chose  to ignore both,  ~nd proceeded  to \ntry  t o  buttress her position~ \n80.  The  Court  finds  that the panel was  not impartial,  and \nthat the Defendant knew  or ahQuld have  known  her panel was  not  impartial \n-nor  fairly  chosen.  Because  of  this,  the parents  declined to permit \nexamination of- their children's  records by  the'  panel. \n-26-\n\n81.  The  Court finds  any  report made  by that panel  to  be \ndeficient and  of  little value  because  of  the paucity of  the \nmaterial  examined  by  them,  their failure to interview personally \nthe  students,  and  their complete  reliance upon  reports  submitted \nto them by  the  defendant,  who  sought  their  approbation.  The \nconclusions  reached  by  the  defendant's  panel  are of  no  value \nand have  indeed  been  rejected by  the medical  experts  who  testified \nin this ca~e, Dr.  Matson  and  Dr.  Daignault. \n82.  The Court  finds  that the defendant in. :this  case,  by \nher  institution of  these  unsubstantiated Orders,  based  upon  no \nmedical  foundation  and  without  regard to the consequences  of \nsuch Orders,  has  made,  as  Dr.  Matson has  stated,  treatment  decisions \nthat  \"play Russian  Roulette\"  with  the  lives  and  safety of  the  /-\nstudents  at BRI. \n83.  The decisions  of  the  defendant,  insofar as  they  are \ntreatment decisions,  are  arbitrary,  capricious  and  beyond  the \nscope  of  her authority. \n84.  The  Court  finds  that the  bad  faith demonstrated  by \nthis defendant has  obliged this Court  to enter preliminary injunc-\ntive relief in these proceedings. \nCONCLUSION \nThis  Court  has  issued a  preliminary injunction,  having  found \nthat the  plaintiff students and  their parents will  suffer  irreparable \nharm if it is not issued.  This  Court has  balanced  the  harm  that \nwill  affect all  of  the  parties,  the deterioration of  the  health \nand  safety of  the  students  and  the  anguish  of  the parents  versus \n-27-\n\nthe absence  of  harm  to  the  defendant.  The  defendant's  statutory \nmandate  is as  a  licensing  authority.  By  her  own  testimony,  she \n\"is not permitted to make  treatment  decisions.  This  injunction \ndoes  not  speak  to  the  licensing function  of  the  defendant \"and, \ntherefore,  harms  her  in no  way.  The  equities  in this  case  demand \nrelief.  These  students  cry  out  for  helpr  and  there  is  every \nlikelihood that the plaintiffs will  prevail  at a  hearing on  the \nmerits.  The  public  interest is the  final  consideration for  the \nissuance  of  a  preliminary injunction.  It should be  apparent \nfrom  the  findings  made  herein that the public  interest can  only \nbe  served by  the  allowance  of  the  plaintiffs'  requests.  The \nbest interests and  welfare  of  children are  in the public  interest. \ncTune  4,  1986 \nErnest Rotenberg,  First \nProbate  and Family  Court \nBristol  County  Division \nMassachusetts  Trial  Court \n-28  and  l ast-",

INTRODUCTION\nThe individual intervenors filed their brief with this Court on October 19, 1996. Briefs\nwere filed on behalf of the Behavior Research Institute (BRI) and the \"student members of the\nclass\" on January 26, 1996 (hereafter Brief of \"Student Class\"). t Although no further extension\nof time had been previously approved by the Court, a brief was filed on behalf of the \"class of\nstudents, parents, and guardians\" on February 2, 1996. For the first time in the history of this\nlitigation, these briefs (hereafter Appellees' Briefs) collectively argue yet another configuration\nof the parties in this case: that there is one certified class of students, parents, mid guardians, 2\nwhich is represented by an attorney (Eugene Curry) who also represents an unrecognized\ncorporate intervenor, the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. and that there are two other\nattorneys (C. Michele Dorsey and Paul Cataldo) who represent an uncertified, undefined, and\nunrecognized subgroup of the plaintiff class comprised only of the students at BRI.\nBased upon this novel reconstruction of the history and alignment of the parties in this\ni The lower court appointedthese attorneysexplicitly torepresentthe \"classof students.\" App. 74.\nThroughout theproceedings in the trial courtand onappeal, these lawyers haveconsistently referredto themselves\nas counsel for the 'Class of Students.\" App. 143, 255. In the face of the individual students' challenge to their\nrole, for the first time inthe history of this litigation andthis dispute, these attorneys have now reconstructed their\nrole and renamed their clients \"the students members of the class.\"\nThis class was permanently certified on December 12, 1986. App. 47. Contrary to various\nassertions inappellees' briefs, see Brief of \"StudentClass\" at28, there isno dispute that this class -- and only this\nclass --exists. The individual studentshave repeatedlyacknowledged that aclassofstudents, parents, andguardians\nwas created by the lower court. See Brief of the Individual Students' at 5, 23. Finally, so too have Ms. Dorsey\nand Mr. Catsldo. See Brief of \"Student Members of the Class\" at 7, n.4\nAt the time the individual students filed their motion to intervene, the status of the class was less clear,\nTen months after BRIand the other parties filed their initial oppositions, the parties jointly discovered the permanent\ncertification decision of the lower court and made it available to trial court just prior tothe April 5, 1995hearing\non the motion.\n\ncase, the Appellees' basically argue two points: (1) that the individual students should not be\npermitted to intervene both because they are members of the plaintiff class and because they have\nseparate representation from the plaintiff class; and (2) the fact that they have involved guardians\nprecludes the appointment of independent next friends. This reply brief challenges the\nprocedural and practical propriety of the first argument and the incorrect legal assumptions of\nthe latter claim.\n1I. THE STUDENTS OF BRI DO NOT HAVE COUNSEL IN THIS CASE WHICII\nCOMPORTS WITII THE REQUIREMENTS OF MASS. R. CIV. P. 23.\nMass. R. Cir. P. 23 imposes strict requirements upon the certification of a class action.\nSniffin v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 11 Mass. App. 714 (1981). Among other criteria, the\ntrial court must determine, both at the time of certification and on an ongoing basis, that the\nclass is adequately represented. Key v. Gilette Co., 782 F.2d 5 (lst Cir. 1986); In re General\nMotors Corp. Engine Interchange Litigation, 594 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir. 1979)(trial court has\nongoing responsibility to undertake stringent examination of adequacy of representation by class\ncounsel at all stages of litigation). The primary factors which courts consider in assessing\nadequacy are the qualifications and experience of the proposed class counsel and the fact that\nthe attorney's sole loyalty and responsibility is to the class. Newberg on Class Actions, §3.07.\n(1992)(hereafter \"Newberg\"). While there is no question that at the time of certification of the\nclass of students, parents, and guardians the then class counsel, Robert Sherman, satisfied these\ncriteria, there is substantial question whether the current class counsel, Eugene Curry, does so,\nsince his primary loyalty is to his corporate client, the BR1 Parents and Friends Association, Inc.\nA parallel criteria for class certification is that there are no conflicts or distinct and\ndifferent interests between classmembers. To the extent that such conflicts or differences are\n2\n\nidentified,theproperapproacheitheristo deny certification or to create subclasses which satisfy\nthe requirements of Rule 23. Although the lower court apparently believed that a separate class\nof students existed, which it appointed attorneys C. Michele Dorsey and Paul Cataldo to\nrepresent, 3 it subsequently discovered this was error. In response to this belated recognition,\nthe trial court, without notice to anyone, unilaterally realigned the parties and their counsel. It\ndenominated Mr. Curry as the attorney for the single class of students, parents, and guardians,\neven though I',isappearance in this case and every pleading he filed thereafter was on behalf of\nhis corporate client, the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. BRI S.A. 63.\nIn its opinion denying the motion to intervene, the lower court acknowledged the distinct\ninterests of the students, declaring that \"direct representation of the Students, independent of any\nGuardian or Next Friend authority, is considered by this Court to be important in protecting the\nStudents fiom potential conflict with the interests of the Parents and Guardians.\" App. 243.\nIt then p':oeeeded to relabel the role of Messrs. Dorsey and Cataldo as counsel for the student\nmembers of the class, /d., as opposed to the student class, as originally described in its\nappointment order. App. 74. This it cannot do under Rule 23, without formally certifying a\nseparate class or at least a subclass. In effect, in disregard of established class action procedures\nand requirements, the lower court, by judicial fiat, declared that there are three attorneys for the\nsame class, one of whom (Mr. Curry) is responsible for representing the interests of the entire\nclass and the other two of whom are informally authorized to assert the interests of certain\nmembers of that same class. This unilateral realignment of counsel and the class ignores the\nThese attorneys were explicitly appointed to represent the \"class of students in the above captioned\nproceeding\" as the succor counsel to attorneys Max Volterra and Marc Perlin, who had been appointed to\nrepresent 'the potential class of all students at the Behavior Research Institute, Inc.\" App. 71, 74.\n3\n\nimportantprocedural and underlying interests of Rule 23. Whatever else its deficiencies, it\nshould not now be considered as a barrier to meaningful participation in this ease by individual\nBRI students who seek to intervene to protect their interests in this matter.\nA. There Is No Attorney in this Case Who Exclusively Represents the Interests of the\nPlaintiff Class.\nIn 1991, the attorney for the plaintiff class, Robert Sherman, withdrew from this\nlitigation. * No successor class counsel was ever formally appointed. No alternative class\ncounsel was even identified, by the lower court or by the parent class representatives, until May\n18, 1995, when the court entered its order on the intervention motion. App. 243. What did\noccur between that time is highly significant to this appeal.\nOn January 12, 1994, more than three years after Mr. Sherman's withdrawal, Eugene\nCurry, Esq. entered his appearance \"for the Parents Association of the Behavior Research\nInstitute, Inc.\" BRI S.A. 63. That appearance explicitly aeknowl¢xlged that the Association did\nnot include all parents and guardians of the BRI students, but rather only eighteen named\nparents. Interestingly, the parent class representatives, Peter Biscardi, and Leo Soucy, were not\nmembers of the Association. Moreover, the Association never filed a motion to intervene or\ncomplaint in intervention, as required by Mass. R. Civ. P. 24. Nevertheless, without\nquestioning the role of the Association or the status of its counsel -- in fact, without a hearing\nor any decision -- the Parents and Friends Association became a party to this litigation. Its\ncounsel, Mr. Curry, thereafter filed pleadings in all relevant matters on behalf of his corporate\nclient, including an opposition and other responses to the individual students' intervention\n4 Mr. Sherman has subsequently, and without obtaining the consent of class representatives or absent\nmembers of the class, reappeared in this case as counsel for BR1.\n4\n\nmotion,aswell asassentstoBRI's various motions with the Appeals Court and this Court, in\nthis and related proceedings during the summer and early fall. s Mr. Curry candidly admits that\nit is the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. which has retained him and which currently\ndirects his efforts. Brief of Plaintiff Class at 16-17.\nThere is a serious question of whether an attorney who represents a corporate\n\"intervenor,\" comprised of selected members of a broadly defined class, can properly and\nsimultaneously serve as counsel for the entire class, at least where these joint roles do not arise\nat the inception of the litigation, are never the subject of notice to the class and a hearing by the\ncourt, and are never specifically determined by the court to be free of conflict. There is also\na serious question of how Mr. Curry can properly devote his undivided loyalty to his newly-\nidentified class clients when he has a previous loyalty and responsibility to his corporate client\nin this case. This is particularly true since the lower court has consistently recognized the\npotential or actual conflict between the interests of the parents and the students. 6 App. 243.\nBut there is no queslion that, given Mr. Curry's role as corporate counselor and the resultant\ndivided loyalty, there is no attorney who exclusively represents the plaintiff class. Therefore,\nthe fact that the students of BRI are members of the plaintiff class should not preclude them\nfrom intervening in this case. 7\nS Virtually all docket entries concerning Mr. Curry reference the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc.\nApp. 027-30, 35.\n6 It is significant that even after learning of his new assignment as class counsel, Mr. Curry has never\nwithdrav, n from his role as corporate counsel.\n7 As more fully explained previously, class membership is not generally considered abar to intervention.\nSee Individual Students' Brief at 39-40. Rather, it is the most appropriate method for absent classmembers to\nparticipate in complex litigation, where their interests diverge from those of the class representatives. Id. Here,\nthe conflicting responsibilities and newly crested role of Mr. Curry constitute additional reasons for allowing\n5\n\nB. There Is No Attorney in this Case Who Has Been Properly Designated As Counsel\nfor the Class of Students, Parents, And Guardians.\nThe individual students do not challenge Mr. Curry's role as counsel for a putative\nintervenor, although the corporation's interest in this case is probably adequately represented by\nBR[ or by the class of students, parents, and guardians. Nor do the individual students question\nthe apparent conflict between eighteen parents being members of an incorporated association,\nwhich has been accorded de facto party status by the lower court, and their simultaneous\nmembership in a certified class. But there is at least a serious question of how counsel who\nappeared solely on behalf of this corporation can be transformed automatically, informally, and\nwithout even the semblance of conformity with the prerequisites of Rule 23, into counsel for the\nplaintiff class, s\nTrial courts are afforded considerable discretion in managing class actions. That\ndiscretion is necessary in part because of the evolving nature of these cases? But that discretion\nis not boundless or completely without procedural requirements. Sni_n, supra; General\nTelephone Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)(court's discretion must be based upon a\n\"rigorous analysis that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied\"). When class counsel\nintervention by the individual students.\ns It was in part because the class had no repre.sentative for three years and because no actions were taken\non behalf of the students between 1991and 1994 that the individual students filed their motion to intervene on\nMarch 31st of that year.\n9 While it is true that no party ever appealed the trial court's certification decision of December 12, 1986,\nthere was no reason to do so, at least from the perspective of the then parties to the litigation. There was one\nattorney who repr_ted only the interests of the plaintiff class and who was actively involved inthe case from its\ninception. Thus, at that time, there was no absence of counsel for the plaintiff class and nodual representation of\ndifferent andpotentially conflicting parties, asthere now is. Moreover, while certain students and their parents who\nwere attemptedto intervene questioned the appropriatenessof the class definition, the class representatives, andthe\ncommonality of interests and claims, they hadno standing toappeal thecertific.ation decision when their intervention\nmotion was denied. App. 13. See Brief of Individual Students at 4, n.7.\n6\n\nwithdraws,newcounselshouldbepromptlyappointed,consistenwt ith thecriteriasetforthin\nRule23(a).

To theextentotherattorneysclaimto representthe\nclass,or aportionthereof,considerablecautionshouldbeexercisedtoensurethattheRule23\nfindings which justified the original certification remain uncontested. Finally, and most\nimportantly,someminimalprocessisdue. Courtsshouldnotunilaterally,ontheirownmotion\nandwithoutnoticeandhearing,simplydesignateanattorneywhorepresentsanotherpartyin\nthesame case to be counsel for a broad plaintiff class, at least where that same court had just\npreviously appointed other attorneys to represent an undefined portion of that class. At a\nminimum, the extraordinary procedural irregularities which are reflected in the recent history\nof this litigation and the lower court's May 18, 1995 Order on Intervention should not be\nconsidered valid justifications for denying the individual students a right to intervene.\nC. Since 27tere Is No Separate Class or Subclass Comprised Solely of Students, No\nCounsel Was or Could Be Properly Authorized to Represent Solely the Interests\nof the Students.\nThe individual students previously have discussed in detail the fact that there never has\nbeen, nor should there be, a separate class or subclass comprised of all students at BRI. I° See\nIndividual Students Brief at 26-32. None of the appellees now challenge the fact that no distinct\nstudent class or subclass exists, even though the trial court appointed C. Michele Dorsey and\nPaul Cataldo to represent precisely that class and even though these attorneys have consistently\nio This is particularly true when there is antagonism or conflict between members of the class, as there is in\nthis case. Atnerican Timber & Trading Co. v. First National Bank, No. 70-687-SK (D.Or. 1979), aff'd. 690 F.2d\n781 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\nclaimed to be counsel for this class. Their creative reconstruction of this history and their\nsolution to this procedural problem is to argue that the plaintiff class actually has two sets of\nattorneys -- one who represents the entire, undivided class of students, parents, and guardians\nand the other two who represent the extemporaneously undefined group of students. That\nsolution, while intriguing and purportedly in the students' interests, is a belated attempt to defeat\nthe individual students' right to intervene in a manner which twists the requirements of class\nactions beyond recognition.\nClasses may certainly have more than one lawyer, with the understanding that they jointly\nrepresent the same interests and members. Separate classes certainly must have more than one\nattorney. Distinct subclasses usually do not have separate counsel from the class attorney,\nalthough arguably they may. But one unified class cannot have two separate counsel, one\ncharged with representing everyone and the other with protecting the interests of only some\nclassmembers. The confusion is obvious, as is evident by the supposedly separate assents to\nBRI's motion to consolidate proceedings in this and related appeals that were filed by Ms.\nDorsey on behalf of the Class of Students and Mr. Curry on behalf of the Class of All Students,\nParents, and GuardiansY App. 255-56.\nThe individual students have not challenged the appointment of Ms. Dorsey and Mr.\nCataldo, although the status and meaning of that appointment has dramatically changed in the\ncourse of this intervention dispute and even in the course of this appeal. While their role is\nambiguous, it arguably can serve some useful purpose. But it cannot constitute, byjudicial fiat,\n11 That confusion is more dramatic and potentially paralyzing when the issue is substantive and the different\nattorneys take different positions on an fundamental issue in the case.\n8\n\neither the creation of a de facto subclass or the appointment of counsel for a nonexisting\nsubclass. Nor can it circumvent the jurisprudential limitations or procedural requirements of\nRule 23. See General Telephone Co., 457 U.S. at 161. As such, it does not constitute\nmeaningful protection of the students' interests nor adequate representation of those interests,\nwhich appellees argue should preclude intervention by the individual students.\nIII. THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS SIIOULD BE PERMITTED TO INTERVENE,\nEVEN TIIOU6]I T]IEY ARE MEMBERS OF TIlE PLAINTIFF CLASS.\nA. The Individual Students' Have a Direct and Immediate Interest in the Pending\nLitigation, Enforcement of the Settlement agreement, and hnplementation of the\nContempt Decision.\nThe lower court and all parties to this case have consistently recognized the distinct and\nimportant interests of the students in this litigation, the Settlement Agreement, and various\nenforcement proceedings thereunder. App. 243-244. Counsel for the \"student members of the\nclass\" assert that they played a significant role in the contempt trial? 2 Yet the appellees argue,\nfor the first time on appeal, that the individual students actually have no interests deserving\nprotection or justifying intervention in the dispute between BRI and DMR concerning the types\nof aversive interventions which may be employed by the school on its students, and the types\nof safeguards which should be instituted to protect the students from harm at the school.\nThis argument is inconsistent with the appellees' positions throughout this litigation, and\nborders on being frivolous. The original complaint filed by BRI in this case asserted a number\nof constitutional and statutory rights of persons with disabilities. The lower court found that the\ndefendants' actions had probably violated these rights. BRI S.A. 17-18. The Settlement\n12 The individual students strongly dispute this characterization, as set forth in section Ill(B) below.\n9\n\nAgreementsoughttosecuretheserights. App. 51. Thecontemptcomplaintreferredtothese\nrights. Students'S.A. 45, 103. Throughouttheentiredecadeof this litigation, BRI has\nconsistentlyc/aimedthatit wasactingto protectandenforcetherightsof its students. It is\nincongruous, to say the least, that it now asserts that this entire case, and particularly the\negregious facts which it asserts in its seventy-one page contempt complaint, do not implicate or\naffect the rights and interests of the students. BRI Brief at 36-37. It is remarkable that counsel\nfor the \"student members of the class\" concur, thereby raising a serious doubt about the\nadequacy of their representation of the BRI students.\nThere can be little question that this entire proceeding revolves around the rights and\ninterests of the students? 3 The trial court has repeatedly so held. App. 69; BRI S.A. 29.\nWhile the specific aversives which may be involuntarily administered to a specific student is\ndetermined in a substituted judgment proceeding, _ it is the Settlement Agreement itself which\ncreated this structure. App. 52. The essential dispute which gave rise to the BRI's contempt\nmotion focused on the authority of DMR under the Settlement Agreement to circumscribe which\naversives may be utilized safely at BRI and thus what interventions could lawfully be\nincorporated in a substituted judgment treatment plan. t5 Students S.A. 87-88. Most\n13 If this was simply a licensing dispute between a private provider and an executive agency, attorney's fees\nawards against the government in excess of $1,500,000 would be difficult to justify.\n14 It is significant that most of the fundamental rights violations alleged in the Complaint in Intervention are\nnever considered in these guardianship proceedings. See App. 112-14. That counsel for the \"student members of\nthe class\" assert that they are regularly litigated in the substituted judgment cases demonstrates their lack of\nfamiliarity with the very proceedings to which they seek to delegate their clients' rights. Brief of'Student Class'\nat 22.\nis DMR's various certification letters and particularly its January 20, 1995 decision banned the use of food\ndeprivation and the next generation of BRrs home-made electroshock machine.

Intervention is explicitly permitted under Rule 23, even when the\nrepresentation of classmembers may be adequate. Fialulaca v.

Given the more relaxed\nstandards for permissive intervention, courts have regularly allowed intervention by absent\nclassmembers under Rule 24(b). Deutschman v. Beneficial Corp., 132 F.R.D. 359 (D.Del.\n1990); Epstein v. Weiss, 50 F.R.D. 386 (E.D.La. 1970). See Newberg, §16.08 at 16-47-49.\nFinally, intervention by individual classmembers has been approved in many protracted\ninjunctive actions to challenge implementation of settlement agreements, tlines v. Rapides\nParish School District, 479 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1973); Brown v. Board ofEduc., 84 F.R.D. 383\n(D.Kan. 1979).\nThe individual students clearly have an interest in this case as a whole, t6 as well as\n16 While the triggering event for the individual students' intervention motion was the resumptionof serious\ndisputes between DMR and BRI concerning the operation of the program, the students' motion was never limited\nsolely toBRI's contempt motion.

The Interests of the Individual Students tlave Not Been and Will Not Be\nAdequately Represented by Counsel for the BR! Parents and Friends Association,\nInc., or Any Separately Appointed Counsel for an Undefined and Uncert_ed\nCh_s of Students.\nthe trial court's contempt decision. BRI S.A. 154. In fact, given the current reality that the entire oversight of the\nstudents' safety, welfare, treatn:ent, and legal rights is now inthe hands of acourt-appointed receiver, the individual\nstudents have an even greater interest in participating in this case, now that the contempt motion has b*:en decided.\n17 It was not so much BRI's contempt motion v,hich prompted the filing of the individual students' motion\nas it was DMR's certification decision of February 9, 1994. The students were far more concerned with DMR's\nactions threatening to decertify BRI, close its program, or restrict its treatment options than they were v.'ith BRI's\nactions under the Settlement Agreement, although they all were inextricably intertwined. Thus, the students' motion\nwas clearly timely, since it was filed within forty-five days of DMR's formal decision. The appellees contention\nthat the motion should be denied on this ground because students with profound disabilities should have been able\nto anticipate that decision some months earlier should be rejected by this Court, as it was by the trial court.\nMoreover, the guardianship counsel who seek appointment as next friends for the individual students were not even\nappointed until November and December of 1993. It is not unreasonable and certainly not untimely for these\nattorneys to take ninety days to familiarize them._elves with their clients and the lengthy legal proceedings in this\nand the substituted judgment cases, to determine that intervention in the equity case was necessary, to formulate and\nimplement a collective strategy, to secure counsel for the intervenors, and to prepare the motion, memo, and\ncomplaint.\n18 See Individual Students' Brief at 15-18.\n19 From the filing of their intervention motion, the individual students have proposed various approaches to\navoid any delay or prejudice to the parties. When the motion was first filed in March 1994, they offered to forego\nany .separate discovery orother activity which might delay the contempt thai. Since the trial was noteven scheduled\nforanother year, allowance of their motion in atimely manner clearly would not have prejudiced the parties. Now\nthatthe contempt trial is completed, and in lighl of this Court's denial of astay last June, App. 250, pernfitting the\nindividual students to intervene at this stage would not result in a retrial of the contempt matter, unless this Court\nreverses the lower court's contempt decision in a separate appeal. There being no other major, pending proceedings\nin this litigation, there can be no argument that the students' intervention would prejudice or delay adjudication of\nthe parties\" claims.\n12\n\nThe appelleesprimarily argue that the individual students should not be permitted to\nintervene both because they are members of the plaintiff class comprised of students, parents,\nand guardians, and because the lower court has provided them protection from the acknowledged\nconflict of interest between the students and the parents by appointing separate counsel for the\nstudents. In essence, they claim that the students are p_ovided protection by the appointment\nof separate counsel to represent their distinct interests.\nIt is well established that absent members of a class are permitted to intervene to protect\ntheir own interests, particularly where there is reason to believe that some conflict may exist\nbetween and among classmembers, as the lower court found here. App. 243. See Shults v.\nChampion International Corp., 35 F.3d 1056 (6th Cir,. 1994) and the Individual Students' Brief\nat 39. Where that class has had no counsel for three years and where the attorney who was\nbelatedly appointed to assist the class is the same lawyer who represents an incorporated\nassociation that includes some classmembers from one subgroup of the class, there is an\nespecially compelling reason to allow absent members of the other subgroup to intervene to\nprotect their distinct interests. Similarly, the \"additional protection\" afforded to the students by\nthe appointment of other lawyers to represent them is of questionable value and certainly does\nnot constitute adequate representation, when: (I) there is no defined class or subclass of students\nto represent and no separate representatives of this subclass to direct, guide, and even influence\nthe attorneys; (2) there is no finding that the students share common claims or interests; (3) there\nis overwhelming evidence of obvious conflicts between the student class represente, tives and most\nof the other students concerning their views, preferences, and legal positions with respect to\n13\n\naversive interventions,the actionsof DMR, and the interpretation of the Settlement\nAgreement; 2° and (4) there is no delineation between the role and responsibilities of counsel\nfor the class of students and counsel for the student members of the class.\nThe most recent and compelling evidence of the inadequacy of the representation assigned\nto the students is the virtually nonexistent role the students played in the trial on BRI's contempt\nmotion. While BRI, DMK, and the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. each called\nbetween four and seven witnesses, the students called none. While BRI, DMR, and the BRI\nParents and Friends Association, Inc. each introduced between one and ninety of their own\nexhibits, the students introduced none. All of the witnesses called by the BR! Parents and\nFriends Association, Inc. were parents, even though the same counsel was also representing the\nclass of students, parents, and guardians. Even when issues concerning the risks of certain\naversives to the students, the harm to certain students from the lack of aversives, 21and the\nabuse to other students at the BRI program were being litigated, the students took no initiative,\nintroduced no evidence, never challenged any of the evidence produced by BRI, never cross-\nexamined any of DMR's witnesses, and barely participated at all.\nThis Court should not countenance the ad hoc reconfiguration of counsel in this case or\nthe contravention of the purposes and strict requirements of Rule 23. Instead, it should conclude\nthat the individual students are entitled to a meaningful voice in this litigation and should be\npermitted to intervene to assert their views and to protect their interests.\n20 For a fuller description of the differences which preclude the certification of aclass of students, see the\nIndividual Students' Brief at 26-31.\n21 In fact, the C. Michele Dorsey objected to the students being examined by an expert to assess the clinical\nharm of DMR's ban on certain aversives.\n14\n\nIV. THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS NEED INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL NEXT\nFRIENDS TO PARTICIPATE IN LITIGATION INVOLVING EXTRAORDINARY\nAND INTRUSIVE AVERS1VE INTERVENTIONS.\nA. The Pending Litigation, the Settlement Agreement, and the Contempt Decision\nDirectly Affect and Determine the Nature and 7_pes of Extraordinary, Painful,\nand Intrusive Interventions Which May Be Involuntarily Administered to\nIncompetent Students at BRL\nBRI asserts that because the contempt action is concerned only with the question of\nwhether DMR violated the consent decree, it will have no affect on the treatment decisions\nwhich are the subject of the individual guardianship proceedings, and that participation by the\nguardianship counsel is therefore unnecessary. But this argument ignores the inextricable link\nbetween the outcome of the contempt action and the scope of treatment interventions available\nfor consideration at a substituted judgment proceeding. For example, if DMR's interpretation\nof the Settlement Agreement is correct, then it had authority to order BRI to discontinue the\nspecialized food program as well as a number of other aversive interventions. App. 169. In\nfact, the nature and scope of the aversives which may be employed by BRI and included in its\nproposed substituted judgment treatment plans is a critical issue in the equity proceeding, in\nwhich the individual students seek to intervene. It was the central issue raised by BRI's\ncontempt motion and decided by the trial court in its contempt decision. Currently, it is at the\ncore of DMR's appeal of that decision. See S]C No. 07107. Thus, there can be little question\nthat decisions of the lower court in this case profoundly and directly control what can and will\noccur in the related guardianship proceedings.\nAny doubt about the far reaching implications of the contempt action on the students'\nindividual substituted judgment proceedings is removed by the provisions in the trial court's\nJudgment prohibiting both DMR end \"anyone acting in concert with them\" from aggressively\n15\n\nlitigatingtreatmentplanreviewsin theindividualguardianshipproceedings. BRI S. A. 156.\nThere can be no question that this ruling will profoundly chill the efforts of the guardianship\ncounsel to advocate for the best interests of their individual student clients in the related\nsubstituted judgment matters.\nB. Parents and Guardians Can No More Determine their Wards' Rights and\nPreferences Concerning Extraordinary Treatment Interventions in This Case Then\nThey Can in a Medication Guardianship Matter.\nBRI asserts that the next friend motion was properly denied \"since the parents already\nare representing the interests of their children as they have all along.\" BRI Brief at 29. This\nsimplistic analysis disregards the inherent conflict that is deemed to exist as a matter of law\nbetween the parents and their children with respect to treatment modalities that are considered\n\"extraordinary and intrusive,\" such as the administration of antipsychotic medication,\nsterilization, or the removal of life-sustaining mechanisms. See Guardianship of Richard Roe,\n383 Mass. 415 (1981); In Matter of Moe, 385 Mass. 555 (1982); In Matter ofR.H., 35 Mass.\nApp. Ct. 478 (1993). As the court stated in Roe:\nDecisions such as the one the guardian wishes to make in this case pose exceedingly\ndifficult problems for even the most capable, detached, and diligent decisionmaker. We\nintend no criticism of the guardian when we say that few parents could make t'_is\nsubstituted judgment determination ... in which the deeisionmaker is called upon to\nignore all but the implementation of the values and preferences of the ward .... Those\ncharacteristics laudable in a parent might often be a substantial handicap to a guardian\nfaced with such a decision but who might in all other circumstances be an excellent\nguardian.\nGuardianship of Roe, 383 Mass. at 442-443. For these reasons, a parent or guardian has no\nauthority to consent to the administration of extraordinary and intrusive medical treatment; the\ndecision must instead be made by a court at a substituted judgment proceeding. Id.\nThe inherent conflict between the parents and the students is not only embedded in\n16\n\nMassachusettlsaw,itis alsoestablishedby theSettlemenAt greement,whichprovidesthatBRI\nmaynotuseaversiveinterventionsonanyindividualstudentwithouttheapprovalof theprobate\ncourt. App. 52. In soagreeing,theparentsthemselvesacknowledgedthatthenatureof these\nhighly intrusiveandpainfulinterventionsmakesit inappropriatefor themto makedecisions\nabouttheiruse,nomatterhowsubjectivelyconcernedtheymaybeaboutthewelfareof their\nchildren.\nGiven that Massachusettcsourts and the partiesin this casehave constructeda\ndecisionmakingscheme which explicitly precludes the parents and guardians from deciding\nwhether aversive therapies may be administered to their child or ward, it is illogical to allow\nthem to be the exclusive voice for the students in the contempt action, where the same issues\nhave been and will continue to be frequently litigated. Where parents and guardians cannot\ndetermine which extraordinary and intrusive interventions, including aversives, can be\ninvoluntarily administered to their wards, so too the parents and guardians cannot exclusively\ndetermine the views, preferences_ and positions of their wards in this equity case, which\nessentially determines what aversives may be lawfully used at BRI and incorporated in its\nsubstituted judgment treatment plans for consideration in the guardianship cases.\nJust as at a substituted judgment hearing it is required that the student have independent\ncounsel, so too it is vital that the students have similar protections in the contempt action. To\ntreat the parents o_ guardians as adequate surrogates for the students so as to prevent the\nappointment of next friends in this case serves only to deprive the court of hearing viewpoints\nwhich may conflict with those of the parents. This is expressly contrary to the teaching of Roe,\nwhich admonished the courts to ensure that it is \"the ward's values and preferences\" which are\n17\n\ndeterminativea, sopposed to what the parents may believe is in his best interest. Roe at 443.\nThe need for independent next friends -- not the parents or guardians -- is particularly\nacute in the present case because the parents have consistently taken positions identical to those\nof BRI. Thus, the denial of the appointment of next friends creates a real danger that the court\nwould not hear a full or complete presentation of the actual views of the students. Cf. In Matter\nof R.H. 35 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 488 (1993) (substituted judgment determination overruled\nbecause guardian ad litem effectively delegated the treatment decision to the family of the\nretarded ward). This danger would be avoided by the appointment as each student's next friend\nthe attorney who represents him in the substituted judgment proceedings. Since these lawyers\nare intimately acquainted with the students they represent, and particularly about their needs and\npreferences with respect to aversive interventions, they are the most objective and appropriate\npersons to serve as their next friends.\nC. The System Suggested By The Proposed Intervenors Is An EJfqcient Means to\nInsure That The Interests of All The Students Are Fairly Presented to the Court.\nThe guardianship counsel have retained Steven J. Schwartz of the Center for Public\nRepresentation to represent their collective interests, if appointed as next friends for the\nindividual students and allowed to intervene. This method was chosen as an efficient, flexible,\nand streamlined approach to spare the court and the parties unnecessary time and expense.\nContrary to BRI's assertion, it would not diminish the voice of the individual students because\neach of them would be consulted by his own next friend who would transmit his views to Mr.\nSchwartz. Thus, there is far less likelihood that the individual preferences of any student would\nbe ignored than if the students had to rely exclusively and collectively on attorneys Dorsey and\nCataldo.\n18\n\nNor is there merit to the claim that the intervenor's system ignores the potential for\nconflict among the individual students who may have opposing views. This claim is merely\nspeculative and contrary to history and experience. In the more than two years since the\narrangement between Mr. Schwartz and the guardianship counsel was implemented, no such\nconflict or divergence of opinion has arisen. More importantly, Mr. Schwartz, 22as well as the\nother guardianship counsel, are governed by the Rules of Professional Responsibility and there\nis no reason to assume that they would not act in accordance with those rules if confronted with\nan actual conflict.\nFinally, in light of the students' profound disabilities and extreme vulnerabilities, it is\nparticularly appropriate that they be represented by an attorney who knows them and is familiar\nwith their circumstances, rather than an attorney who has not had the opportunity to build a\nrelationship of trust and confidence over a period of years.\nV. AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR\nTillS APPEAL.\nWithout any argument, or even identification of any objectionable passages in the\nappellant's brief, BRI seeks attorneys' fees and costs under Mass. R. App. P. 25 and G.L.c.\n211, § 15, because it claims the appeal is frivolous. 23 It is well established that courts are\n\"hesitant to deem an appeal frivolous except in egregious cases.\" Symons v. O'Keefe, 419 Mass.\n288, 303 (1995); Avery v. Steele, 414 Mass. 450, 456 (1993). It takes much more than\n\"unpersuasive arguments\" to render an ap,,w.al frivolous. Symons, 419 Mass. at 303; Avery, 414\n_'2 The appellees repeatedly challenge Mr. Schwartz' motives in representing the individual students. The\nlower court completely ignored thse arguments. This Court should do the same.\n23 Tho fact that BRI stapled its request for sanctions at the end of its Brief, and refers to itself as \"her,\"\nsuggests that the request was an afterthought which even it does not lake seriously.\n19\n\nMass. at 455. An appeal is frivolous only \"when the law is well-settled and there can be no\nreasonable expectation of a reversal.\" ld. It is not \"frivolous because it presents an argument\nthat is novel, unusual or ingenious, or urges adoption of a new principle of law or revision of\nan old one.\" Allen v. Batchelder, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 458 (1984).\nAppellees have not, and cannot, point to any \"well-settled\" law that makes this appeal\nfutile. Nor do they present a shred of evidence that the appeal was pressed for an improper\npurpose. Given the flagrant irregularities in the procedures chosen by the trial court to\nsafeguard the interests of the students, the appeal raises substantial issues that are at least\nsufficiently meritorious to warrant rejection of the claim for sanctions.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above and those incorporated in the Individual Students' initial\nbrief, the decision of the lower court should be reversed and the individual students should be\npermitted to intervene through their next friends, their guardianship counsel.\nTHE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS,\nTHROUGH GUARDIANSHIP COUNSEL\nAND NEXT FRIENDS\nBy their attorneys,\nStev.e,S ,.h,w ,   4844o\nJames Pingeon, BBO #541852\nCenter for Public Representation\n246 Walnut Street\nNewton, MA 02160\n(617) 965-0776\n20\n\nRepresentatives of the Guardianship Counsel:\nRichard Ames\n90 Canal Street\nBoston, MA. 02114-2022\n(617) 742-4300\nJohn Coyne\n558 Pleasant Street\nNew Bedford, MA. 02740\n(508) 990-3738\n21",

(\"JRC\" or\n\"BRI\"), where JRC established neither (i) a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its\n\nunderlying contempt claim nor (2) a threat of\nimmediate or irreparable harm.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nStatement of Facts\nBy letter dated March 23, 1995 (the\n\"Decertification Letter\"), the Commissioner of\nDMR (the \"Commissioner\") decertified JRC from\nutilizing Level III aversive behavior\nmodification techniques, l/ R.A. 476, 501. In\norder to allow for a gradual phasing out of the\nuse of such techniques or for transfer of\n!/ Under DMR regulations, \"Level III\nInterventions\" are defined as follows:\nI. Any intervention which involves the\ncontingent application of physical contact\naversive stimuli such as spanking, slapping or\nhitting.\n2. Time out wherein an individual is placed in\na room alone for a period of time exceeding 15\nminutes.\n3. Any Intervention not listed in 104 CMR 20.00\nas a Level I or Level II Intervention which is\nhighly intrusive and/or highly restrictive of\nfreedom of movement.\n4. Any Intervention which alone, in combination\nwith other Interventions, or as a result of\nmultiple applications of the same Intervention\nposes a significant risk of physical or\npsychological harm to the individual.\n104 C.M.R. § 20.15(3)(d).\n-2-\n\nclients to other facilities that are certified\nto use Level III aversives,\nthis decertification\nwas not to become effective until July i, 1995,\nmore than three months after the date of the\nletter. R.A. 501. As stated in the Decertifica-\ntion Letter itself, the grounds for the\ndecertification were JRC's stated refusal and\nactual failure to comply with the conditions set\nforth in the Commissioner's letter of January\n20, 1995 (the \"Conditional Certification\nLetter\"), R.A. 501, in which the Commissioner\nhad granted JRC a two-year certification to use\nLevel III aversives, provided that JRC complied\nwith the conditions stated therein. R.A. 261,\n4o8.Z/\nAS stated in the Conditional Certification\nLetter, the Commissioner approved JRC's\napplication to use Level III interventions on\n_/ The conditions imposed in the Conditional\nCertification Letter were supported by findings\nincluded in the letter itself as well as more\nspecific and detailed findings set forth in an\naccompanying Report on Compliance by the Judge\nRotenberg Educational Center, Inc. with the\nRequirements of the Behavior Modification\nRegulations and the Terms of Certification to\nUse Level III Interventions (the \"_\").\nR.A. 422.\n-3-\n\nall individuals currently receiving such\ntreatments, with the exception of six\nindividuals. R.A. 408-09. With respect to\nthose six individuals, whose treatment had been\nclosely monitored by DMRover the preceding six\nmonths, DMRdetermined that the implementation\nof their\ntreatment plans does not comply with\nDMR's behavior modification regulations, in that\nthe Level III interventions used to treat these\nindividuals are not the least intrusive and most\nappropriate for each individual and pose an\nunreasonable degree of intrusion, restriction of\nmovement, and physical or psychological ha_.\nR.A. 409-13.\nAccordingly, DMR conditioned its\ncertification to use Level III interventions by\nrequiring JRC e_her to modify the treatment\nplans of these six individuals to comply with\nDMR regulations and to reapply for certification\nto utilize Level III aversives pursuant to the\nrevised plans o_Krto modify the treatment plans\nof these individuals to provide for treatment\nwith Level I or II, rather than Level III,\naversives. R.A. 416-17. In either case, the\nmodified treatment plans were not to be\nimplemented without the approval of the JRC\n-4-\n\nhuman rights and peer review committees; the\nconsent of the guardian; Probate Court\nauthorization using the substituted judgment\ncriteria for the use of Level III interventions;\nand, for Massachusetts clients, compliance with\nthe procedural requirements of DMR's ISP\nregulations, which require either the guardian's\nconsent or prior administrative hearings before\nchanging a client's ISP. R.A. 417. Thus, other\nthan requiring JRC to modify its written\ntreatment plans, this condition had no immediate\neffect on JRC operations or on JRC clients.\nAnd, absent all of the requisite approvals,\nincluding that of the Probate Court, of any\nrevised plans calling for the use of Level III\naversives, this condition would never affect the\nactual treatment of any JRC client.\nThe only other condition relating directly\nto treatment required that JRC not use certain\nspecified Level III interventions, including the\n\"specialized food program,\" a food deprivation\nprogram under which a client may receive as\nlittle as 20% of his minimum daily caloric\nrequirement unless he earns additional food by\nnot exhibiting problem behaviors. R.A. 419.\nThis condition was based on DMR's findings that\n-5-\n\nthere is no professional literature to support\nthe use of these specified procedures as\ntreatment for human beings in general or for the\nproblems exhibited by JRC clients in particular,\nand that the specialized food program deprives a\nclient of basic sustenance. R.A. 419.\nThe remaining conditions addressed JRC°s\nobligation to permit DMR to have access to JRC\nfacilities and records so that DMR could\ncontinue to monitor JRC's compliance with the\ncertification conditions and with DMR regula-\ntions in general. R.A. 417-18. These condi-\ntions were based on DMR's findings that, since\nJuly 5, 1994, JRC had failed to permit such\naccess. R.A. 415-16. The manner in which JRC\nwas to comply with each of these conditions was\nset forth in agreements entered into by JRC and\nDMR after six weeks of intensive negotiations.\nR.A. 349-406.\nThe Conditional Certification Letter\ninformed JRC that, if it was aggrieved by the\ncertification decision, it had a right to appeal\nto the Division of Administrative Law Appeals\n(\"DALA\") , pursuant to 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4) (f) (8), G.L.c. 19B, § 15(d), and G.L.\nc. 30A, § 13. R.A. 420. JRC did not take such\n-6-\n\nan appeal, nor did it seek relief in any other\nadministrative or judicial forum from the\ncertification conditions.\nRather, based solely on its counsel's\nopinion that the certification conditions were\n\"illegal,\" JRC simply refused to comply with\nthem. Shortly after receiving the Conditional\nCertification Letter, JRC's\ncounsel informed\nDMR's counsel that \"JRC regards the\ncommunication and the orders contained in this\ncommunication as having no force and effect and,\ntherefore, . that JRC will not comply with\nany of the Commissioner's orders.\" R.A. 478,\n498.\nNot wanting to rely exclusively on the\nrepresentations of JRC's counsel as to JRC's\nrefusal to comply with the certification\nconditions, the Commissioner wrote directly to\nMatthew Israel, the Board President and\nExecutive Director of JRC, on March 3, 1995,\ninviting him to disavow his attorneys'\nstatements of JRC's intention not to comply with\nthe certification conditions and specifically\ninforming him of DMR's determinations, based on\nobservations of DMR staff, that JRC was\npresently in violation of several important\n-7-\n\ncertification conditions. R.A. at 477-78, 493.\nOn March 23, 1995, having received no response\nfrom Dr. Israel, the Commissioner issued the\nDecertification Letter that gave rise to JRC's\nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief. R.A.\n478, 501.\nPrior Proceedinqs\nOn March 24, 1995, JRC filed a third amended\ncontempt complaint, R.A. 41, and a motion for\npreliminary injunctive relief, seeking, among\nother things, to preliminarily enjoin DMR from\nrevoking JRC's certification to use Level III\naversives. R.A. 113, 114. JRC sought and\nobtained a hearing on that motion the same day.\nAt that hearing, both JRC and the Commissioner\nrelied upon their written submissions, which\nincluded JRC's motion, R.A. 113, 114; supporting\nmemorandum; and the Israel Affidavit and\nexhibits thereto, R.A. 124; and the\nCommissioner's opposing memorandum; Affidavit,\nR.A. 255; and First Supplemental Affidavit and\nexhibits thereto. R.A. 476. The same day, the\ncourt entered the preliminary injunction (the\n\"Injunction\") at issue. R.A. 504. The\nInjunction enjoined the Commissioner from\n-8-\n\nenforcing decertification of Behavior\nResearch Institute, Inc. (sometimes called\nthe Judge Rotenberg Educational Center,\nInc.) as set forth in a letter dated March\n23, 1995 provided:\na. that during the terms of this order\nor any extensions thereof, the BRI,\nalias, shall comply with the conditions\ncontained in the Commissioner's letter\ndated January 20, 1995 granting\nconditional certification to said BRI,\nalias; and\nb. that any changes in treatment plans\nto be made shall be subject to the\napproval of the Court in a substituted\njudgment proceeding after due notice\nand an opportunity to be heard.\nR.A. 504. Other\nthan the conclusory statement,\nwhich is part of the printed form used by the\ncourt, that it appears that the Commissioner \"is\ncommitting or threatens to commit the acts set\nforth below to the irreparable injury of the\nplaintiff,\" the court made no findings and\nstated no reasons for entering an Injunction or\nfor the particular terms of the Injunction\nentered. R.A. 504.\nAfter the issuance of the Injunction, it\nappeared, from correspondence between the\nparties and comments made by the court at a\nsubsequent hearing, that the Commissioner's\ninterpretation of the Injunction might differ\nfrom that of JRC and, perhaps, that of the court\n-9-\n\nitself. Therefore, the Commissioner attempted\nto obtain clarification of the Injunction by\nfiling a motion to clarify it. R.A. 505. !/\nHowever, by letter dated April 18, 1995, the\nClerk returned that motion and supporting\nmemorandumto the Commissioner's counsel \"in\naccordance with Judge LaStaiti's request.\" R.A.\n513. In her letter, the Clerk stated her own\nbelief\nthat \"[the Commissioner's] concerns were\naddressed in the preliminary injunction entered\non March 24, 1995 and in the order eDtered April\n14, 1995.\" R.A. 513. The trial court's April\n14, 1995 Order, to which the Clerk presumably\nreferred in her letter, stated as follows:\nAll treatment decisions or changes in\ntreatment plans must be addressed in the\nl/ The issue on which the Commissioner sought\nclarification was whether the second proviso of\nthe Court's order requires Probate Court\napproval of \"changes in treatment plans,\" as the\nproviso literally stated, or whether the proviso\nfurther requires Probate Court approval prior to\nany change in treatment, including the cessation\nof certain types of aversive treatments (e.g.,\nthe specialized food program) that are presently\nincluded in treatment plans previously approved\nby the Probate Court but are not permitted under\nCondition 95-6 of the Commissioner's January 20,\n1995 certification letter. This clarification\nwas ultimately sought and obtained from a Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court, pursuant to G.L.\nc. 231, § 118, ¶ i. R.A. 508, 517, 523.\n-10-\n\nsubstituted judgment proceedings in the\nindividual guardianship cases after due\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard. Said\nproceedings are not governed by the January\n20, 1995 letter from DMRto BRI re:\ncertification. The Department of Mental\nRetardation's contention that their letter\nof January 20, 1995 supercedes this Court's\norder of January 7, 1987 is at odds with the\nplain language of the settlement agreement\nfiled with this Court on December 12, 1986.\nThe Department of Mental Retardation cannot\nby implementation of its certification\nprocess subvert the provisions of said\nsettlement agreement and also the\njurisdiction of this Court to r_ender\nsubstituted judgment determinations on a\ncase by case basis.\nR.A. 515.\nOn or about April 21, 1995, the Commissioner\nfiled a timely notice of appeal, pursuant to\nG.L.c. 231, § 118, ¶ 2, of the Injunction that\nwas entered on March 24, 1995. R.A. 507. The\nCommissioner also filed a Petition for\nInterlocutory Relief from or Modification of\nPreliminary Injunction Pending Appeal, pursuant\nto G.L.c. 231, § 118, ¶ I. R.A. 508. That\npetition was unopposed. On May ii, 1995, a\nSingle Justice of the Appeals Court (Brown, J.)\nissued an order modifying the Injunction, by\nadding at the end of the Injunction as issued\nthe following additional proviso:\nc. that any changes in treatment that\ndo not require changes in treatment plans,\nincluding but not limited to cessation of\n-ii-\n\nthe treatments specified in Condition 95-6,\ndo not require prior approval of the Court\nin substituted judgment proceedings.\nR.A. 517.\nOn June 8, 1995, the Commissioner requested\nclarification of the May Ii, 1995 Order. R.A.\n518. In response to that motion, the Single\nJustice (Brown, J.) issued a Supplemental Order\nas follows:\nIt is ordered that the Judge Rotenberg\nEducational Center is enjoined from using\nthe following Level III aversives, pending a\nfurther order of this Court or a Single\nJustice thereof: automatic negative\nreinforcement with electric shock,\nprogra_,led multiple application of electric\nshock, the specialized food program, and\nbehavior rehearsal lessons using Level III\ninterventions.\nR.A. 512.\nJRC then sought relief from the Supreme\nJudicial Court for Suffolk County, under G.L.\nc. 211, § 3, from the above order (and a similar\norder in a related case). After a hearing on\nthat petition, a Single Justice (Abrams, J.)\ndenied the requested relief, \"conclud[ing] that\nthere was no abuse of discretion and there was a\nsupportable basis for the single justice's\nOrders.\" R.A. 524.\n-12-\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nBy entering the Injunction at issue here,\nwhich enjoins the Commissioner of DMR from\nexecuting his statutory and regulatory duties to\nstrictly regulate the use of Level III aversives\nby JRC, a licensee of DMR, the trial court erred\nas a matter of law in assessing JRC's likelihood\nof success on the merits of its contempt\ncomplaint, abused its discretion in balancing\nthe equities, and impermissibly intruded on the\nCommissioner's exercise of discretion. For\nthese reasons, the Injunction should be vacated\nin its entirety or, in the alternative, modified\nin accordance with the orders of the Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court, which were entered\npending this appeal.\nJRC is unlikely to succeed, as a matter of\nlaw, on the merits of its contempt complaint,\nbecause the provisions of the Settlement\nAgreement on which JRC relies are not\nsufficiently clear and unequivocal to form the\nbasis for contempt sanctions, particularly\nagainst an executive branch official who is\nattempting to carrying out his statutory duties\nas he understands them. Pp. 17-30. To the\nextent that JRC is utilizing its contempt\n-13-\n\ncomplaint as a vehicle for obtaining judicial\nreview of the Commissioner's regulatory actions,\nsuch an attempt is also bound to fail on\njurisdictional grounds (because of JRC's failure\nto exhaust its administrative remedies) as well\nas on the merits (because the Commissioner's\ndecisions are well within his statutory and\nregulatory authority and\ncorrect as a matter of\nlaw). Pp. 30-44.\nThe Injunction is also unwarranted as a\nmatter of equity, in that any harm that JRC\nwould have suffered absent the Injunction is far\noutweighed by the risk of harm to DMR and, more\nimportant, to JRC's clients, resulting from the\nInjunction as entered by the trial court. To\nthe extent that the Injunction permits JRC to\ncontinue to utilize aversive procedures that it\nis not certified to use by DMR, the Injunction\nintrudes impermissibly on the Commissioner's\nexercise of his discretion in carrying out his\nstatutory duties. For that reason as well, The\nInjunction should either be vacated or modified\nby this Court. Pp. 44-54.\n-14-\n\nARGUMENT\nI. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW UNDER G.L.\nc. 231, ._ i18, PAR. 2\nUnder G.L.c. 231, § 118, par. 2,\n[a] party aggrieved by an interlocutory\norder of a trial court justice . . .\ngranting . . . a preliminary injunction,\nmay appeal therefrom to the appeals\ncourt . . . which shall affirm, modify,\nvacate, set aside, reverse the order or\nremand the cause and direct the entry of\nsuch appropriate order as may be just under\nthe circumstances .... Pursuant to action\ntaken by the appellate court the cause shall\nbe remanded to the trial court for further\nproceedings•\nAppellate review under section 118 is governed\nby the standard of review set out in Packaging\nIndustries Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609\n(1980)• See Commonwealth v. Mass. CRINC, 392\nMass. 79 (1984)•\nUnder Chene_, the applicable standard for\nreview of the grant or denial of a request for\npreliminary injunctive relief is whether the\nCourt abused its discretion• However,\n[w]hile our standard of review is thus\nframed in terms of abuse of discretion, the\nLegislature would not have exempted orders\ngranting or denying preliminary injunctions\nfrom the final judgment rule \"if it intended\nappellate courts to be mere rubber-stamps\nsave for the rare cases when a [trial] judge\nhas misunderstood the law or transcended the\nbounds of reason.\" Therefore, in assessing\nwhether a judge erred in granting or denying\na request for preliminary injunctive relief,\nwe must look to the same factors properly\nconsidered by the judge in the first\ninstance• Evaluation of these factors turns\n_15-\n\non \"mixed questions of fact and law. On\nreview the trial court's . . conclusions\nof law are subject to broad review and will\nbe reversed if incorrect.\"\nChene_, 380 Mass. at 615-16 (citations\nomitted). In addition, \"while weight will be\naccorded to the exercise of discretion by the\njudge below, if the order was predicated solely\non documentary evidence we may draw our own\nconclusions from the record.\" Id.\nUnder CheneM,\nwhen asked to grant a preliminary\ninjunction, the judge initially evaluates in\ncombination the moving party's claim of\ninjury and chance of success on the merits.\nIf the judge is convinced that failure to\nissue the injunction would subject the\nmoving party to a substantial risk of\nirreparable harm, the judge must then\nbalance this risk against any similar risk\nof irreparable harm which granting the\ninjunction would create for the opposing\nparty. . Only where the balance between\nthese risks cuts in favor of the moving\nparty may a preliminary injunction properly\nissue.\nChene_, 380 Mass. at 617. Furthermore, BRI must\ndemonstrate that the public interest would not\nbe adversely affected by the injunction and that\nthe harm to it outweighs the harm to the public\ninterest. Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. at 87-90. The\nproper application of these standards clearly\ndemonstrates that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion and erred as a matter of law in\nissuing the Injunction.\n-16-\n\nII. THERE IS NOLIKELIHOOD THAT JRC WILL SUCCEED\nAS A MATTEROF LAWON ITS CONTEMPTCLAIMS.\nIn order to succeed on a claim of contempt,\nthe complaining party must demonstrate \"a clear\nand undoubted disobedience of a clear and\nunequivocal command.\"\nWarren Gardens Housing\n_ark, 420 Mass. 699, 700 (1995);\nCommonwealth v. One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, 413\nMass. 407, 411 (1992); Allen v. School Committee\nof Boston, 400 Mass. 193, 194 (1987); Manchester\nv. DEQ_E, 381 Mass. 208, 212 (1980). JRC cannot\nmeet this standard.\nA. The Settlement Agreement Does Not\nProhibit DMR from Regulating JRC.\nThe Settlement Agreement in this case, R.A.\n264, contains no \"unequivocal command\" that the\nCommissioner refrain from regulating JRC in\ngeneral or from conditioning or revoking JRC's\ncertification to utilize Level III aversives or\nlicenses to operate group homes in particular.\nTo the contrary, while no mention is made in the\nAgreement of \"certification,\" the Agreement\nexpressly authorizes DMH (DMR's predecessor\nagency) to revoke BRI's licenses without court\napproval, once BRI became licensed by DMH. R.A.\n271. Not only are such express commands absent\n-17-\n\nfrom the Agreement, construing the agreement to\nexempt JRC from DMR's\ncertification and\nlicensing requirements would be contrary to one\nof the salient purposes of the Agreement, to\nensure that JRC complies with all applicable\nstate regulations. R.A. at 270.\nIn the absence of any command, equivocal or\notherwise, concerning certification or\nlicensure, JRC alleges that, by closely\nmonitoring JRC's compliance with DMR's\nregulations and, where noncompliance was found,\ntaking various regulatory actions to enforce its\nregulations, the Commissioner violated the\nprovisions of the Agreement that require:\n(I) that \"each party shall discharge its\nobligations under the terms of this agreement,\nin good faith\"; (2) that the court monitor\narbitrate disputes between the parties; (3) that\nJRC's intake of new clients \"not be\nimpermissibly obstructed\"; and (4) that JRC's\nuse of Level III aversives on incompetent adult\nclients be approved by the Probate Court in\nsubstituted judgment proceedings. R.A. I01. In\nmaking these conclusory allegations, JRC fails\nto specify which of its hundreds of factual\n-18-\n\nallegations purportedly constitute \"clear and\nunequivocal disobedience\" of what particular\nlanguage of the Settlement Agreement provisions\ncited.\nB.\nThe Good Faith Provision Is Too\nAmbiguous to Form the Basis for a\nFinding of Contempt or for the\nImposition of Contempt Sanctions.\nThe provision of the Settlement Agreement on\nwhich JRC primarily relies as a basis for its\ncontempt charges is the provision that requires\n\"each party [to] discharge its obligations under\nthe terms of this agreement, in good faith.\"\nK.A. 277. In order to establish the\nCommissioner's contempt of this provision, JRC\nwould have to identify an \"obligation under the\nterms of this agreement\" that the Commissioner\nhas failed to discharge in good faith. Since,\nas discussed above, the Agreement imposes no\nobligation on the Commissioner to refrain from\nregulating JRC and, as will be shown below, the\nCommissioner cannot, as a matter of law, be held\nin contempt of any of the other provisions cited\nby JRC, any contempt charge based on a violation\nof the good faith provision of the Agreement\nmust fail. United States v. Board of Education\nof Chicago, 744 F.2d 1300, 1307 (7th Cir. 1984)\n-19-\n\n(where party found not in violation of\nsubstantive requirement of consent decree, party\ncould not be found in contempt of requirement to\nuse good faith efforts to comply with that\nprovision), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1116 (1985);\n799 F.2d 281, 292 (7th Cir. 1986) (good faith\n\"not a term that exists in a vacuum\"; nature and\ncircumstances of underlying obligation must be\nconsidered in determining good faith compliance).\nMoreover, even if Paragraph L of the\nSettlement Agreement could be construed as\nrequiring the Commissioner generally to act \"in\ngood faith\" (apart from any specific obligations\nunder the Settlement Agreement), the inherent\nsubjectivity and ambiguity of that phrase\nprecludes the imposition of contempt sanctions\nfor a violation of this provision, which cannot\nbe characterized as an \"unequivocal command\" to\ndo or refrain from doing any particular act.\nUnited States v. Board of Education, 717 F.2d\n378, 382 (7th Cir. 1983) (good faith provision\nnot unambiguous), 799 F.2d at 289, 291 (good\nfaith provision \"inherently nebulous\" and\n\"ambiguous\" and therefore not enforceable by\ncontempt sanctions, absent prior judicial\n-20-\n\nclarification and opportunity to comply with\nprovision as judicially clarified).\nParticularly where, as here, the alleged\ncontemnor is a state official, who is attempting\nto carry out his statutory duties as he\nunderstands them, contempt sanctions are not an\nappropriate means of redressing any violation of\nhis obligation to act in good faith• United\nStates v. Board of Education, 717 F.2d at 385.\nIndeed, imposing such sanctions on the\nCommissioner for the making of policy decisions\nin the exercise of his statutory authority would\nraise serious separation of powers problems•\nId. at 383; 799 F.2d at 289 (discussing\n\"inherent problems of ordering remedial relief\nagainst the government\"); Alves v. Town of\nBraintree, 341 Mass. 6, 12 (1960) (fact that\ntown official acted on advice of counsel \"does\nnot dispense with compliance with the decree\n• but it is of decisive effect in\ndetermining what disposition to make in the\ncontempt proceedings\"). Accordingly, even if\nthe Commissioner's interpretation of his\nauthority is held to be erroneous, rather than\nimpose contempt sanctions, the court should\n-21-\n\nassume\nthat, as a public official, he will\nhenceforth act in accordance with the law as\njudicially construed. United States v. Board of\nEducation, 717 F.2d at 384; Alves, 341 Mass. at\n12.\nC. None of the Other Provisions Relied\nUDOn by JRC ImPoses a Clear and\nUnequivocal Obliuation on the\nCommissioner.\ni. Settlement Agreement, Part A.\nPart A of the Settlement Agreement imposes\nno obligations on DMR, other than to provide\nclinicians to advise the court under Part A,\n¶ 7, R.A. 269; and JRC does not contend that DMR\nhas violated the latter provision. In the\nabsence of a \"clear and undoubted disobedience\nof a clear and unequivocal command,\" neicher the\nCommissioner nor DMR may be held in contempt of\nPart A. Warren Gardens, 420 Mass. at 700.\nUnder Part A, JRC is required to obtain\nauthorization from the Probate Court in\nsubstituted judgement proceedings in individual\nguardianship cases prior to using aversive\nbehavior modification techniques. However, the\nfact that the Settlement Agreement, like DMR's\nown regulations, 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(4) (e) (3),\nrequires that JRC use Level III aversives only\n-22-\n\nwhen authorized to do so by the Probate Court\nutilizing substituted judgment criteria,\nSettlement Agreement, Part A, ¶ i, does not mean\nthat once a treatment plan providing for the use\nof Level III aversives is approved by the\nProbate Court, JRC is thereby insulated from\nDMR's other regulatory requirements, including\nthe requirement that the provider be certified\nby DMRto utilize such procedures, 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4) (f).\nRather, as indicated by the term\n\"substituted judgment,\" those proceedings\nfunction only as a substitute for a ward's own\ninformed consent.\nSunerintendent of Belchertown\nState School v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 752\n(1977). Just as a competent adult's consent\nwould not enable JRC to administer treatments in\nviolation of DMR's other regulatory\nrequirements, a substituted judgment order\nsimilarly has no such legal effect. Rutherford\nv. United States, 616 F.2d 455, 457 (10th Cir.)\n(\"decision by the patient whether to have a\ntreatment or not is a protected right; but his\nselection of a particular treatment is\nwithin the area of governmental interest in\n-23-\n\nprotecting public health\"), _ denied, 449\nU.S. 937 (1980).\nIn other words, a determination that a ward,\nif competent, would consent to aversive\ntreatment, is a necessary, but not a sufficient\ncondition for the utilization of such treatment\nunder state law. S__9_1_04 C.M.R. § 20.15(4) (d)\nand (e) (listing other required approvals, in\naddition to a client's consent or substituted\njudgment). By analogy, the fact that a\nparticular medical procedure was approved by a\nProbate Court in substituted judgment\nproceedings would not \"legalize\" the administra-\ntion of that procedure by a physician or\nhospital that did not meet state licensing\nrequirements, as determined by the appropriate\nstate regulatory agency.\nThus, the fact that some of the\ncertification conditions imposed by the\nCommissioner require JRC to cease utilizing\ncertain aversive treatments that have been\napproved by the Probate Court in substituted\njudgment proceedings cannot, as a matter of law,\nconstitute contempt of Paragraph A of the\nSettlement Agreement. Nor do such certification\n-24-\n\nconditions violate the Probate Court's orders in\nthose individual\ncases. The Probate Court's\ndetermination that a ward, if competent, would\nconsent to the use of the treatments contained\nin his treatment plan, does not _ that JRC\nutilize every treatment contained in the plan\nand approved by the Probate Court. While a\nparticular Level III aversive cannot be used\nwithout Probate Court approval, the converse is\nnot true; the fact that the Probate Court has\napproved the use of a particular treatment does\nnot mean that it must be used. Nor does the\nProbate Court's approval of a treatment plan\nrequire that the authorized treatment be\nprovided by a particular provider, such as JRC,\nespecially where that provider is not certified\nto provide the treatment in question.\nMoreover, to the extent that JRC contends\nthat the certification conditions violate\nProbate Court orders in individual cases, the\nappropriate remedy would be to seek contempt\nsanctions in those cases, rather than in the\npresent case, in which the court's remedial\npowers are limited to enforcing the Settlement\nAgreement in this case. R.A. 276.\n-25-\n\nSettlement\n2. Agreement, Part B_____2.\nPart B, ¶ 2, of the Settlement Agreement\nimposes no obligations on DMR, other than to,\n\"if appropriate, afford [the court monitor], at\nhis request, technical assistance necessary to\nperform his duties.\" R.A. 270. Given the\nsubjective and inherently ambiguous nature of\nthe qualifying phrases \"if appropriate\" and\n\"necessary,\" this obligation cannot be\ncharacterized as providing clear and unequivocal\nnotice to DMR as to when such assistance is\nrequired or what form such assistance must\ntake. Cf. Warren Gardens Housing Coop., 420\nMass. at 701 (the phrase \"adequately supervise\"\ndid not provide clear and unequivocal notice\nconcerning what steps the defendant was required\nto take). Moreover, even if the technical\nassistance provision were enforceable by\ncontempt, there is no contention that DMR has\nviolated this provision.\nThe remaining provisions of Part B, ¶ 2,\neither impose obligations on the Court Monitor\n(\"Dr. Daignault shall undertake general\nmontoring \"; \"Dr. Daignault shall be\nresponsible for overseeing B,R.I.'s compliance\n-26-\n\nwith all applicable state regulations \"-\n\"Dr. Daignault shall report to the Court\nconcerning any issues he deems necessary \";\nand \"Dr. Daignault shall arbitrate any disputes\nbetween the parties \") or are in the\npassive voice (\"matter shall be submitted to the\nCourt for resolution\"), making it unclear who is\nrequired to make such a submission, Dr.\nDaignault or the party disagreeing with an\narbitration decision or recommendation of Dr.\nDaignault. Again, in the absence of a clear and\nunequivocal court order directed at the\nCommissioner, there is no likelihood that he can\nproperly be found to be in contempt of this\nprovision.\nEven if the requirement that \"Dr. Daignault\nshall arbitrate any disputes between the\nparties\" could be deemed to impose a clear and\nunequivocal obligation on DMR to submit certain\ndisputes to arbitration, it is unclear what\ndisputes are covered by this provision, since\nearlier in the same paragraph of the Settlement\nAgreement an exception to the Court Monitor's\nduties is carved out for the oversight of BRI's\ncompliance with regulations that \"involve\n-27-\n\ntreatment procedures authorized by the Court in\naccordance with Paragraph A.\" R.A. 270. Since\nmost, if not all, of the disputes\nthat are the\nsubject of the present complaint involve BRI's\ncompliance or noncompliance with DMR's behavior\nmodification regulations, which govern\ncertification to use Level III aversives and\ntherefore \"involve treatment procedures\nauthorized by the Court in accordance with\nParagraph A,\" these disputes appear to fall\nwithin the above-quoted exception to the Court\nMonitor's jurisdiction. Accordingly, Part B,\n¶ 2, cannot be said to impose a clear and\nunequivocal obligation to submit such disputes\nto arbitration by the Court Monitor.\n3. Settlement AQreement. Part C. ¶ 3.\nPart C, ¶ 3, of the Settlement Agreement\nprovides, in pertinent part, that \"intake at\nB.R.I. for new clients shall be reopened and\nshall not be impermissibly obstructed during the\npendency of this agreement.\" R.A. 271. It is\nnot clear on the face of this provision, which\nis in the passive voice, who has the obligation\nto open intake of new students and not to\nimpermissibly obstruct it during the pendency of\n-28-\n\nthe agreement, which was anticipated to\nautomatically terminate one year after its\nexecution. R.A. 276. However, since it was the\nOffice for Children that closed intake in the\nfirst place, it is reasonable to assume that\nthis provision was intended to impose a\nrequirement on OFC, rather than any other\nparty. In any event, this provision does not\nclearly and unequivocally impose such an\nobligation on DMR, or even DMH, DMR's\npredecessor as licensor of BRI.\nFurthermore, on its face, this provision\ndoes not unequivocally prohibit the closing of\nintake of new clients but rather provides that\nsuch intake shall not be \"impermissibly\nobstructed.\" Since this provision thus provides\nno clear and unequivocal notice\nof what conduct\nmight be deemed to be an \"impermissible\nobstruction\" of intake, this provision is not\nenforceable by contempt. Cf. Warren Gardens,\n420 Mass. at 701 (phrase \"adequately supervise\"\nnot enforceable by contempt for this reason).\nNor can this provision be deemed to provide\nclear and unequivocal notice to DMR that its\nconduct with respect to existing students at BRI\n-29-\n\ncould be punishable as contempt of this\nprovision, which expressly relates only to\n\"intake at B.R.I. for new clients.\" Similarly,\nto the extent that JRC seeks to hold DMR\nresponsible for any indirect effect of its\nconduct on other funding agencies' declining to\nrefer new students to BRI, any such indirect\nviolation of this provision would not be\npunishable as contempt, which requires a direct\nviolation of a court order.\nThus, there is no likelihood that JRC will\nsucceed, as a matter of law, on any of its\nclaims for contempt.\nIII. TO THE EXTENTTHAT\nJRC SEEKS JUDICIAL\nREVIEW OF THE CO_4ISSIONER'S\nCERTIFICATION AND LICENSING DECISIONS,\nSUCH CLAIMS MUST FAIL ON JURISDICTIONAL\nGROUNDS AND ON THE MERITS.\nA. JRC Has Failed to Exhaust Its\nAdministrative Remedies.\nTo the extent that JRC is utilizing the\nvehicle of a contempt complaint to seek judicial\nreview of the merits of the Commissioner's\nconditional certification, decertification, or\nlicensing decisions, there is no likelihood that\nsuch an attempt will succeed. As stated in the\nCommissioner's Conditional Certification and\nDecertification Letters themselves, JRC's avenue\n-30-\n\nfor seeking judicial review of those decisions,\npursuant\nto G.L.c. 30A, § 14, was, first, to\nseek an administrative hearing before DALA\nwithin 21 days of the dates of those decisions.\nR.A. 420, 503. Having failed to avail itself of\nits administrative remedies in a timely manner,\nJRC is precluded from seeking judicial review.\nEast Chop Tennis Club V. MCAD, 364 Mass. 444\n(1973); cf. School Committee of Frankli_ v.\nCommissioner of Education, 395 Mass. 800, 808\n(1985) (party who fails to comply with the\nprocedural prerequisites for seeking judicial\nreview under chapter 30A cannot seek such review\nin an action for declaratory relief).\nSimilarly, if and when DMR takes any adverse\naction with respect to JRC's group home\nlicenses, it will be required to exhaust its\nadministrative remedies before seeking judicial\nreview. 104 C.M.R. § 23.24(3); G.L.c. 19B,\n§ 15(e); G.L.c. 30A, _§ 13, 14.\nFurthermore, whether or not exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies would be required here,\nany petitions for judicial review of DMR's\ncertification or licensing decisions would have\nto be filed as independent actions in Superior\n-31-\n\nCourt, which has exclusive jurisdiction over\nsuch petitions, G.L.c. 30A, § 14, rather than\nin the present case, in which the\ncourt's\ncontinuing jurisdiction is limited to enforcing\nthe Settlement Agreement. R.A. 276.\nB. The Conmlissioner's Certification\nand Decertification Decisions Wer_\nWell Within the Scope of His\nStatutQry and Regulatory Authority.\nIf, despite these jurisdictional\nimpediments, the court were to adjudicate, as\npart of a contempt proceeding, JRC's claims that\nthe Commissioner's conditional certification and\ndecertification decisions were in excess of his\nauthority or otherwise unlawful, those claims\nshould be rejected on their face.\nIn issuing the Decertification Letter, the\nCommissioner was acting pursuant to his\nstatutory authority, under G.L.c. 19B, § i, to\n\"exercise exclusive supervision and control of\nthe department [of mental retardation],\" which,\nin turn, has \"general supervision of all private\nfacilities for [mentally retarded] persons.\"\nMore specifically, the Commissioner was acting\npursuant to DMR's behavior modification\n-32-\n\nregulations, 104 C.M.R. § 20.15, which are\nexpressly premised on the following underlying\npolicies concerning the use\nof highly intrusive\naversive treatments:\nIt is the purpose of the Department\n• . . to assure the dignity, health and\nsafety of its clients.\nAs a general matter, it is the\nDepartment's strong policy that\nbehavior modification procedures which\npose a significant risk of physical or\npsychological harm to the clients or\nwhich are highly intrusive or\nrestrictive should be used only as a\nlast resort, subject to the most\nextensive safeguards and\nmonitoring.\nIt is the Department's policy that the\nuse of such procedures in such\nexceptional circumstances must meet the\nheaviest burden of review among all\ntreatments. The use of such procedures\nfor a particular individual will be\nallowed for a particular client only\nafter a rigorous review and approval by\nclinicians, human rights committees,\nand the Department. This process will\ninsure, before the client can be\nsubjected to this type of extraordinary\nprocedure, that clinicians have\nexhausted other less intrusive,\nrestrictive or risky procedures and\nfurther, that the likely benefit of the\nprocedure to the individual outweighs\nits apparent risk, intrusiveness, or\nrestrictiveness.\nIn addition, it is the Department's\npolicy that such procedures are only to\nbe used in programs which are specially\nqualified and certified to use such\nprocedures with appropriate care. It\n-33-\n\nis further the policy of the Department\nthat the application of a procedure for\nclients even after it has been approved\nmust be strictly monitored by the\nprogram as well as by the Department\nitself. In summary, it is the purpose\nof [the Behavior Modification\nregulations] to insure that behavior\nmodification procedures are used to\nenhance the dignity, health, and safety\nof clients and that extraordinary\nprocedures which pose a risk to such\nhealth, safety and dignity may only be\nused as a last resort, by certified\nprograms, subject to the strictest\nsafeguards and monitoring.\n104 C.M.R. § 20.15(1)(c).\nThe behavior modification regulations set\nforth general requirements for the use of\nbehavior modification treatments, including the\nfollowing, which are particularly pertinent here:\nI. No behavior modification plan may\nprovide for a program of treatment\nwhich denies the individual a\nnutritionally sound diet\n2. No Interventions shall be approved\nin the absence of a determination\nthat the behaviors sought to be\naddressed may not be effectively\ntreated by any less intrusive, less\nrestrictive Intervention and that the\npredictable risks, as weighed against\nthe benefits of the procedure, would\nnot pose an unreasonable degree of\nintrusion, restriction of movement,\nphysical harm or psychological\nharm.\n3. Only those Interventions which are,\nof all Interventions, least restrictive\nof the individual's freedom of movement\nand most appropriate given the\n-34-\n\nindividual's needs, or least intrusive\nand most appropriate, may be employed.\n5. Level III Interventions may be used\nonly to address extraordinarily\ndifficult or dangerous behavioral\nproblems that significantly interfere\nwith appropriate behavior and or the\nlearning of appropriate and useful\nskills and that have seriously harmed\nor are likely to seriously harm the\nindividual or others.\n104 C.M.R. _ 20.15(4) (b). The regulations\nfurther require that \"[a]ll proposed uses of\nLevel II or Level III Interventions shall be set\nforth in a written plan\" and specify what that\nplan must contain and what reviews, approvals,\nand consents are required prior to the\nimplementation of any such plan. 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4) (c), (d), and (e).\nFinally, the behavior modification\nregulations set forth the requirements for\ncertification to use Level III interventions and\nthe procedures for granting, conditioning,\ndenying, and revoking such certification. 104\nC.M.R. § 20.15_4) (f). These procedures include\nthe requirements that an applicant for\ncertification provide DMR representatives with\nfull access to its records, physical plant, and\nemployees and permit DMR representatives to\n-35-\n\nobserve fully the treatment used. 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4)(f)(6). Once a program is\ncertified\nto use Level III aversives, its performance is\nsubject to the periodic inspections required of\nall licensed facilities as well as \"such\nadditional inspections as the Commissioner in\nhis or her discretion deem appropriate.\" 104\nC.M.R. § 20.15(4) (f) (i0).\nAs will be shown in the balance of this\nsection, the Commissioner's decision to revoke\nJRC's certification fully accords with these\npolicies and regulatory requirements. Because\nthe decision to revoke JRC's certification was\nbased on JRC's refusal to abide by the\nconditions of its conditional certification, the\nfactual and legal basis for those conditions\nwill be addressed first, focusing on those\nconditions to which JRC has voiced particular\nobjections.\nAt the outset, there can be no question that\nthe Commissioner has the authority to impose\nconditions on a provider's certification to use\nLevel III aversives. The behavior modification\nregulations expressly authorize the Commissioner\nto \"certify [a] program subject to any\n-36-\n\napplicable conditions based upon his or\ndetermination of the program's compliance with\nall applicable requirements.\" 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4) (f) (7).\nThe primary set of conditions imposed in the\nConditional Certification Letter, Conditions\n95-1.1 through 95-1.8, required JRC eithe____to___Kr\nmodify the treatment plans of six specified\nindividuals to comply with DMRregulations and\nto reapply for certification to utilize Level\nIII aversives pursuant to the revised plans o_Kr\nto modify the treatment plans of these\nindividuals to provide for treatment with Level\nI or II, rather than Level _II, aversives. R.A.\n416-17. In either\ncase, the modified treatment\nplans were not to be implemented without the\napproval of the JRC human rights and peer review\ncommittees; the consent of the guardian; Probate\nCourt authorization using the substituted\njudgment criteria for the use of Level III\ninterventions; and, for the Massachusetts\nclients, compliance with the procedural\nrequirements of DMR's ISP regulations, which\nprovide for objection by a client's parent or\nguardian and require administrative hearings\nwhen a change to a client's ISP is proposed.\n-37-\n\nR.A. 416-17. Although the Commissioner set\ndeadlines for compliance with\nthese conditions,\nhe further authorized JRC to seek an extension\nof these deadlines for good cause shown. R.A.\n417.\nThese conditions were based on DMR's\nspecific and detailed findings, contained in the\nConditional Certification Letter itself and\nfurther elaborated upon in the accompanying\nReport, that JRC's implementation of these\nindividuals' treatment plans and the written\nplans themselves violated DMR's regulations.\nR.A. 409-14, 426-49. Specifically, DMR found\nthat JRC's use of Level III interventions to\npunish minor behaviors, such as staring at thumb\nor fingers or tearing paper, violated the\nrequirement that such interventions \"be used\nonly to address extraordinarily difficult or\ndangerous behavioral problems that significantly\ninterfere with appropriate behavior and or the\nlearning of appropriate and useful skills and\nthat have seriously harmed or are likely to\nseriously harm the individual or others.\" 104\nC.M.R. § 20.15(4) (b) (5). R.A. 409. In so\nfinding, DMR specifically rejected, as\nunsupported by empirical fact, JRC's contention\n-38-\n\nthat such minor behaviors were precursors to an\nextraordinarily difficult or dangerous behavior\nand that each such minor behavior had seriously\nharmed or was likely to seriously harm the\nindividual or others. R.A. 409.\nDMR further found that, in implementing\nthese individuals' treatment plans, JRC violated\nthe requirements that \"[o]nly those\nInterventions which are, of all available\nInterventions, least restrictive of the\nindividual's freedom of movement and most\nappropriate given the individual's needs, or\nleast intrusive and most appropriate, may be\nemployed,\" 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(4) (b) (3); and that\nthe rationale for the use of each Level III\nintervention be \"based on a comprehensive\nfunctional analysis of the antecedents and\nconsequences of the targeted behavior.\" 104\nC.M.R. § 20.15(4) (c) (3). R.A. 410. Instead,\nciting many examples, DMR found that JRC's use\nof Level III interventions was based on\n\"outdated functional assessments that are\nneither comprehensive nor specific, and are not\nused appropriately in formulating treatment.\"\nR.A. 410-12.\n-39-\n\nIn further support of Conditions 95-i.1\nthrough 95-1.8, DMRfound that JRC's data\ncollection procedures do not provide for\nmonitoring, evaluating, and documenting the use\nof each intervention, as required by 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4) (c) (5). As further found by DMR,\nthese are not merely technical record-keeping\nviolations but, rather, result in Level III\ninterventions being used for impermissible\npurposes and without the requisite approvals and\nconsents. R.A. 412. Again, numerous examples\nof such violations are cited in the Conditional\nCertification Letter and the accompanying\nReport. R.A. 412-13.\nAnother set of conditions to which JRC\nspecifically objected,\nConditions 95-6.1 through\n95-6.3, required that JRC not use certain\nspecified Level III interventions, including the\n\"specialized food program,\" a food deprivation\nprogram under which a client may receive as\nlittle as 20 percent of his minimum daily\ncaloric requirement unless he earns additional\nfood by not exhibiting problem behaviors. R.A.\n419. These conditions were based on DMR's\nfinding that there is no professional literature\n-40-\n\nto support the use of these specified procedures\nas treatment for human beings in general or for\nthe problems exhibited by JRC clients in\nparticular. R.A. 419. With respect to the\nspecialized food program in particular, DMR\nfound that this program \"denies the\nclient basic\nsustenance,\" thereby violating the regulatory\nrequirement that \"[n]o Behavior Modification\nplan may provide for a program of treatment\nwhich denies the individual . a\nnutritionally sound diet.\" 104 C.M.R.\n§ 20.15(4) (b) (i). R.A. 419. In further support\nof this condition, the Report outlines and\ndocuments specific nutritional and sanitation\nproblems with the specialized foed program as\nwell as evidence that this intervention is not\nonly ineffective in controlling the targeted\nproblem behaviors but may actually increase or\ncause other problem behaviors that are then\ntreated with other Level III interventions.\nR.A. 469-75.\nThe remaining conditions in the Conditional\nCertification Letter addressed JRC's obligation\nto permit DMR to have access to JRC facilities\nand records so that DMR could continue to\n-41-\n\nmonitor JRC's compliance with the\ncertification\nconditions and with DMR regulations in general,\nas required Dy 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(4) (f) (6) and\n(i0). R.A. 417-18. These conditions were based\non DMR's specific and detailed findings as to\nJRC's repeated and continuing failure to permit\nsuch access. R.A. 415-16.\nIn sum, each of the conditions imposed by\nthe Commissioner is amply supported by the\nspecific and detailed findings contained in the\nConditional Certification Letter itself as well\nas in the accompanying Report. Given these\nfindings (over which JRC has foregone its right\nto administrative and judicial review), these\nconditions were required to ensure that the\nhealth, safety, and dignity of JRC's clients\nwere protected; and the conditions were narrowly\ntailored to address the particular deficiencies\nfound.\nHowever, rather than either comply with\nthese conditions or seek administrative and\njudicial review of review of them, JRC simply\nrefused to comply with them and defiantly\ncontinued to use Level III aversives without the\nreasonable safeguards imposed by the\n-42-\n\nCommissioner. R.A. 477-78. As outlined in the\nDecertification Letter, JRC failed to comply\nwith several important conditions, including the\nrequirement to submit the revised treatment\nplans imposed by Condition 95-1, the requirement\nto\ncooperate fully with DMR's inspections\nimposed by Condition 95-4, and the requirement\nto discontinue use of the specialized food\nprogram imposed by Condition 95-6. R.A. 501.\nIn light of the resulting risk to the\nhealth, safety, and dignity of JRC's clients,\nthe Commissioner had no choice but to take the\nnext step of revoking JRC's certification. This\nsanction is expressly authorized by DMR's\nregulations, which provide that \"a certification\nmay be revoked . upon a finding that the\nconditions for certification are no longer\nmet.\" 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(4) (f) (10). Since the\nCommissioner has expressly so found and JRC does\nnot contest this finding, there is no factual or\nlegal basis for a reviewing court to overturn\nthe Commissioner's decertification decision.\nTherefore, JRC cannot establish a likelihood of\nsuccess in challenging the merits of that\ndecision.\n-43-\n\nIV. JRC FAILED TO DEMONSTRATETHAT IT\nWOULDSUFFERANY LEGALLY COGNIZABLEOR\nIRREPARABLEHARMABSENTTHE REQUESTED\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\nAs indicated in the Commissioner's\nDecertification Letter, JRC's decertification\nwas not to become effective until July i, 1995,\nthree months after the issuance of the letter.\nR.A. 501. Even after the effective date, JRC\nwould continue to be fully licensed by the\nCommonwealth and therefore able to continue\nserving new and existing clients, albeit with\nless intrusive treatments. R.A. 503. Also, as\nfurther stated in the Decertification Letter\nitself, the Commissioner's decision to decertify\nJRC is subject to administrative and judicial\nreview, pursuant to 104 C.M.R. §§ 20.15(4) (f) (8)\nand 23.24(3); G.L.c. 19B, § 15(d); and G.L.\nc. 30A, §§ 13 and 14, including the right to\nseek a stay of DMR's decision on the\nadministrative appeal from DMR, DALA, or from\nthe Superior Court. G.L.c. 30A, § 14(3). R.A.\n503. If JRC were successful in such\nadministrative or judicial proceedings, the\ndecertification decision would be stayed and\nthen vacated.\n-44-\n\nIn these circumstances, JRC failed to\nestablish the requisite immediate or irreparable\nharm that would warrant the extraordinary relief\nsought. Any harm that JRC would suffer as a\nresult of the decertification would not have\noccurred until July i, 1995, three months after\nthe preliminary injunction was sought and\ngranted. Therefore, at the time the\ntrial court\nheard the motion, any such harm would not have\nbeen immediate. Nor would such harm have been\nirreparable. To the contrary, JRC had ample\nopportunity to seek reversal of such action,\nfirst before DALA and then, if necessary, before\nthe Superior or appellate courts.\nMoreover, the harms that JRC alleged fell\nfar short of constituting the type of legally\ncognizable harm that would warrant the\nextraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive\nrelief. Certainly, the burden of exhausting\nadministrative remedies, even if substantial,\ndoes not constitute a sufficient basis for such\nrelief. FTC v. Standard Oil Co., 449 U.S. 232,\n244 (1980). Nor does any damage that BRI may\nsuffer to its reputation among potential or\npresent clients as a result of DMR's issuance of\n-45-\n\nthe Conditional Certification Letter, warrant\nthe relief sought. Rather, any such harm, which\nwould flow from any adverse agency decision, is\na necessary consequence of conducting a highly\nregulated operation. If this were a proper\nbasis for preliminary injunctive relief, then\nthe government could never issue an adverse\ndecision without prior judicial review, which\nwould stand the doctrine of exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies on its head.\nMoreover, any harm that JRC will suffer as a\nresult of being decertified from using any Level\nIII aversives is self-inflicted. Simply by\ncomplying with the narrowly tailored and\nrelatively unburdensome conditions imposed in\nthe Conditional Certification Letter, JRC could\nhave avoided this harm entirely. Only because\nit chose not to do so did it incur the more\ndrastic sanction of decertification.\nIn the absence of the requisite showing of\nimmediate and irreparable harm, JRC's motion for\na preliminary injunction should have been\ndenied. Chene_,M, 380 Mass. at 616-18.\n-46-\n\nV. ANY HARMTHAT JRC WOULDSUFFERABSENTTHE\nREQUESTEDRELIEF IS FAR OUTWEIGHEDBY THE\nRISK OF HARMTO DMRAND TO THE PUBLIC BY\nENJOINING DMRFROMEXERCISING ITS STATUTORY\nMANDATETO PROTECTTHE HEALTH, SAFETY, AND\nDIGNITY OF THE CLIENTS OF JRC.\nIn decertifying JRC from using Level III\naversives, the Commissioner was carrying out\nDMR's policy, as reflected in its behavior\nmodification regulations, \"to insure that\nbehavior modification procedures are used to\nenhance the dignity, health, and safety of\nclients and that extraordinary procedures which\npose a risk to such health, safety and dignity\nmay only be used as a last resort, by\ncertified\nprograms, subject to the strictest safeguards\nand monitoring.\" 104 C.M.R. § 20.15(i) (c). It\nwas on the basis of such strict monitoring that\nDMR imposed the safeguards that JRC chose to\nignore. In the face of JRC's failure to comply\nwith the certification conditions set forth in\nthe Commissioner's Conditional Certification\nLetter, which were specifically designed to\nprotect the dignity, health, and safety of JRC's\nclients, DMR had no choice but to decertify JRC\nfrom using Level III aversives. For the trial\ncourt to enjoin that decertification, and thereby\npermit JRC to use these extraordinary procedures\nwithout the safeguards imposed by DMR, subjects\n-47-\n\nthe clients to the very risk to their health,\nsafety, and dignity that the certification\nconditions were designed to avoid. _/ See\nRent-A-Car, Inc. v. Connolly, 686 F.2d 1029,\n1035 (ist Cir. 1982) (public interest would be\nadversely affected by preliminary injunction\nenjoining enforcement of valid statute). This\nvery real risk to this particularly vulnerable\npopulation, which is thoroughly documented by\nthe findings set forth in the Conditional\nCertification Letter and the Report that\naccompanied it, far outweigh any harm to JRC's\nbusiness interests.\nThe injunction that JRC sought would thus\nthwart the Department in meeting its statutory\nand regulatory responsibilities. The public\ninterest, as expressed by the Legislature in\nG.L.c. 19B, is in favor of Departmental\n!/ Although the substituted judgment\nproceedings also serve to protect the interests\nof the wards, the scope of DMR's regulatory\nauthority is broader and therefore encompasses\nconsiderations, such as compliance with DMR's\nrestraint, abuse and neglect, record-keeping,\nand access regulations, which are not\nnecessarily pertinent to a substituted judgment\ndetermination but are nevertheless essential to\nprotect the health, safety, and dignity of the\nclients.\n-48-\n\noversight of programs like JRC, particularly\nwhere the use of highly intrusive and\nrestrictive behavior modification\ntreatments is\nconcerned. An injunction against the\nfulfillment of legislative mandates runs against\nthe public interest and should not have been\ngranted. Agency Rent-a-Car, 686 F.2d at 1035;\ncf. Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. at 88-90 (government\nneed not demonstrate irreparable harm to itself\nwhen it seeks an injunction to enforce\ncompliance with a statute).\nVI. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PRELIMINARY\nINJUNCTION EXEMPTS JRC FROM COMPLYING WITH\nTHE CERTIFICATION CONDITIONS, IT IMPERMIS-\nSIBLY INTRUDES ON THE COMMISSIONER'S\nSTATUTORY AND REG_TORY AUTHORIT[ AND IS\nUNWARRANTED AS A MAtUrER OF EQUITY.\nTo the extent that the preliminary\ninjunction permits the use of treatment\nprocedures that JRC is not certified to\nutilize--i.e., the specialized food program and\nthe other procedures excluded from JRC's\ncertification by Condition 95-6--it intrudes\nunduly on the Commissioner's statutory and\nregulatory authority and obligation to regulate\nthe provision of services to mentally retarded\nindividuals. As discussed above, the\nCommissioner's imposition of the condition in\nquestion was well within the scope of his\n-49-\n\nstatutory and regulatory authority. Therefore,\nto the extent that the Injunction, as issued by\nthe trial court, exempts JRC from complying with\nthis condition unless specifically ordered to do\nso by the Probate Court in individual\nguardianship proceedings, _/ it intrudes unduly\non the Commissioner's regulatory authority, and\nwas therefore appropriately modified by a Single\nJustice of the Appeals\nCourt, to clarify that\nJRC is not permitted to use these procedures,\npending this appeal.\nAs consistently held by the Supreme Judicial\nCourt, despite the existence of some judicial\noversight, state agencies retain the authority\nand discretion to determine how to perform their\nstatutory and regulatory duties. Care and\nProtection of Jeremy, 419 Mass. 616, 622-23\n(1995); Care _nd Protection of I_aac, 419 Mass.\n602, 606-07 (1995); Charrier v. Charrier, 416\n_/ Although it Is not clear from the face of\nthe Injunction that it permits JRC to continue\nto utilize those procedures unless ordered to\ncease doing so by the Probate Court in an\nindividual case, that is the way the Injunction\nwas interpreted by JRC and the trial court, R.A.\n505, 508, 518, until it was modified and\nclarified by an order and supplemental order of\nthe Single Justice of the Appeals Court. R.A.\n517, 523.\n-50-\n\nMass. 105, ii0 (1993);\nIn re McKnight, 406 Mass.\n787 (1990); Guardianship of Anthony, 402 Mass.\n723, 727 (1988); Bradley v. Commissioner of\nMental Health, 386 Mass. 363, 365 (1982). A\npreliminary injunction that intrudes _n that\ndiscretion is therefore improper and should be\nmodified by this Court on that ground, Correia\nv. Department of Public Welfare, 414 Mass. 157,\n169 (1993) (ordering modification of preliminary\ninjunction that \"infringes too drastically on\nthe department's authority to administer its\nprogram as it chooses\" , if not vacated\nentirely.\nModifying the preliminary injunction to\nrequire compliance with Condition 95-6 is also\nwarranted by the balance of harms. In seeking\nto enjoin the operation of Condition 95-6, the\nonly concrete harm JRC alleged with respect to\nelimination of the specialized food program is\nthe importance of having food reinforcers\navailable for use on its clients. R.A. 136.\nHowever, the Commissioner's Conditional\nCertification Letter expressly authorized the\ncontinued use of the \"contingent food program,\"\nanother Level III aversive that delays but does\n-51-\n\nnot entirely eliminate the provision of a\nclient's minimum delay caloric requirements.\nR.A. 419. Given the health and safety risks\nposed by the more drastic specialized food\nprogram, R.A. 419, 469-75, the risk of harm of\nceasing the specialized food program is far\noutweighed by the risks of\ncontinuing it.\nWith respect to the other forms of treatment\nprohibited by Condition 95-6, JRC made only the\ngeneralized claim, which would apply to any\naversive treatment, that these procedures are\nimportant in treating serious self-injurious\nbehavior. R.A. 135. Since, absent these\nprocedures, JRC would still have at its disposal\nthe other Level III aversives authorized by\nCondition 95-6, including odor aversive, time\nout, movement limitation, restraint, contingent\nfood program, and electric shock, R.A. 419, the\nrisk of ceasing to use these particular\nprocedures does not appear to be significant.\nThis is particularly true of behavior rehearsal\nlessons, which are rarely used, and programmed\nautomatic electric shock, which is not even\ntechnologically available at this time. R.A.\n135-36. On the other hand, the risk of\n-52-\n\ncontinuing to use these treatments, for which\nthere is no professional literature supporting\ntheir use for treatment on human beings, R.A.\n419, is grave indeed.\nThus, the balance of harms and,\nparticularly, the public interest weigh heavily\nin favor of the modification granted by the\nSingle Justice of the Appeals Court, pending the\npresent appeal. Agency Rent-a-Car, 686 F.2d at\n1035; Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. at 88-90.\nAccordingly, if the preliminary injunction is\nnot vacated in its entirety for the reasons\ndiscussed above, the orders issued by the Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court should be continued\nin effect by this Court.\nCONCSUSION\nFor all of the above reasons, this Court\nshould vacate the preliminary injunction issued\nby the trial court or, in the alternative,\ncontinue in effect the modification and\n-53-\n\nclarification of that injunction entered by the\nSingle Justice\nof the Appeals Court.\nRespectfully submitted,\nSCOTT HARSHBARGER\nATTORNEY GENERAL\nJ_ith S.

Whether the trial court has the statutory or inherent\nauthority to issue an order which supplants the authority of\nthe Disabled Persons Protection Commission in cases of abuse\nof students at Behavior Research Institute/ Judge Rotenberg\nCenter.\n2. Whether the plenary powers conferred on the\nReceiver by the trial court regarding abuse investigations\ninvolving students at Behavior Research Institute/ Judge\nRotenberg Center are unconstitutional and in conflict with\nthe authority of the Disabled Persons Protection Commission\npursuant to G.L.c. 19C.\n\n2\nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS\nThe Disabled Persons Protection Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the DPPC\") is an independent\nagency of the Commonwealth established pursuant to G.L.c.\n19(2. G.L.c. 19C, §2. The DPPC is charged with conducting\ninvestigations of allegations of abuse of disabled adults\nbetween the ages of eighteen (18) and fifty nine (59).\nG.L.c. 19C, §4. Pursuant to its statutory authority, the DPPC\nmay conduct such investigations itself or designate an\nappropriate agency within the Executive Office of Health and\nHuman Services to conduct the investigation. G.L.c. 19C,\n§§4Co) and (c). The basis for making such a designation is\nthat the designated agency is that state agency, based upon\nthe individual's disability, which is responsible for providing\nservices to the disabled person. G.L.c. 19C, §§4(b) and (c).\nIn addition, the DPPC is authorized to ensure the\nimplementation of emergency protective services where the\nrisk of further abuse to the disabled person is imminent. G.L.\nc. 19C, §6. The DPPC is further authorized to issue protective\nservice recommendations upon the completion of an\n\ninvestigationthat substantiatesthe existence of abuse. G.L.c.\n19C, §5.\nIt is instructive to note that during the latest period for\nwhich records have been compiled, namely fiscal year 1995\n(July I, 1994 to June 30, 1995) of the 1800 abuse investigations\neither conducted by or for the DPPC, 1062 investigations were\nreferred to, and conducted by the Department of Mental\nRetardation (hereinafter referred to as \"DMR\"). During that\nsame period and based upon the complaints it received, the\nDPPC authorized sixteen (16) investigations of alleged abuse of\nstudents at Behavior Research Institute/ Judge Rotenberg\nCenter (hereinafter referred to as \"BRI/ JRC\"). Of these\nsixteen (16) investigations, ten (10) were conducted by the\nDPPC itself, five (5) were conducted by DMR, and one (1) was\nconducted by another state agency pursuant to G.L.c. 19C\n§4(b)\nOf the ten (10) investigations conducted by DPPC,\nallegations of abuse were unsubstantiated in six (6) cases.\nallegations were substantiated in three (3) cases, and one (1)\ninvestigation remained pending. Of the five (5)\ninvestigations conducted by DMR. the allegations of abuse\n\nwere unsubstantiatedin three (3) cases,substantiatedin one\n(1) caseandundeterminedin one (1) case. The remaining\ninvestigationconductedby the Departmentof Mental Health\nwas undetermined.\nRegardless of whether an investigation is conducted by\nthe DPPC itself or assigned by the DPPC to another agency,\nsuch as DMR, G.L.c. 19C, §5 mandates that when the existence\nof abase is substantiated, the investigator must enumerate\nprotective service recommendations in the investigation\nreport. G.L.c. 19C, §5, 118 CMR §5.01(2)(d). The purpose of\nthese recommendations is to ensure the future safety of the\ndisabled alleged victim from further abuse. Accordingly,\nthese recommendations are forwarded by the DPPC for\nimplementation to the state agency responsible for providing\nservices to the disabled person. 118 CMR §7.02(2).\nThe Order issued by the trial court negatively affects\nthe functioning of the DPPC and the implementation of its\nauthority pursuant to G.L.c. 19(2. In three distinct areas the\ntrial cou_t's order impermissibly impinges upon the statutory\nframework within which the DPPC operates:\nFirst, the provision of the order which makes it applicable to \" . . .\nanyone acting in concert with (the defendant, his agents,\n\nattorneyandemployees)... \"Trial Court Order, Par. 7, Appellant\nApp. p. 1341; Second, the provision of the order that empowers\nthe Receiver to oversee all investigations conducted by DMR.\nTrial Court Order, Par. 19(5), Appellant App. p. 1346; and\nThird, the provision of the order which enjoins the Defendant\n(and anyone acting in concert with him) from issuing any orders\nor directives which interfere with outstanding treatment orders\nor decisions issued by the trial court. Trial Court Order, Par. 10,\nAppellant App. p. 1342.\nWithout more specification each of these provisions of the\ntrial court's order impermissibly impinges upon the statutory\nauthority of the DPPC. The order abrogates the independent\nauthority of the DPPC to operate in the area of abuse\ninvestigations involving students at BRI/JRC.\nThe specific issue in which the amicus has an interest\nis the manner in which the order interferes with and usurps\nthe independent mechanisms established by G.L.c. 19C to\nensure the safety and well-being of the students at BRI/JRC.\nThe practical effect of the trial court's order is to nullify the\nindependent statutory authority of the DPPC to assign abuse\ninvestigations to DMR for completion, to oversee abuse\n\n6\ninvestigations conducted by DMR, to determine the existence of\nabuse, and to ensure the implementation of protective services to\nremediate substantiated cases of abuse.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS AND STATEMENT OF CASE\nThe amicus will adopt the Statement of Facts and Statement of\nCase as presented by the Appellant, the Commissioner of\nMental Retardation.\n\n7\nARGUMENT\nTHE TRIAL COURT DOES NOT HAVE THE STATUTORY\nI*\nOR INHERENT AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ORDERS WHICH\nSUPPLANT THE AUTHORITY OF THE DISABLED\nPERSONS PROTECTION COMMISSION IN CASES OF\nABUSE OF STUDENTS AT BEHAVIOR RESEARCH\nINSTITUTE/ JUDGE ROTENBERG CENTER.\n\"Probate courts [are] courts of superior and general\njurisdiction with reference to all cases and matters in which\nthey have jurisdiction.\" G.L.c. 215, §2 By virtue of\nG.L.c. 201, §6A and G.L.c. 215, §6, the Probate and Family Court\nhas broad powers to fashion equitable remedies in matters\nrelating to the guardianship of mentally retarded persons.\nSuperintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz, 373\nMass. 728, 755 (1977), Guardianship of Bassett, 7 Mass. App. Ct.\n56, 64 (1979). However, the Probate Court's authority to\nfashion broad remedies does not invest the Probate Court with\nthe authority to issue orders over a non-party. Matter of\nMcKnight, 406 Mass. 787. 791-793 (1990). See also Department\nof Mental Retardation v. Kendrew, 418 Mass. 50, p.56 (1994)\nwherein the court held that a district court judge, no matter\nhow well inteutioned, had no authority to issue an order\n\ndirecting DMR to take certain specified action where DMR was\nnot a party to the matter before the Court.\nIn the instant case, the DPPC was not a party to the\naction before the trial court. The legislature created the DPPC\nin 1986. G.L.c. 19{2 added as 19B by St. 1986, c. 655, §1; St.1987,\nc.465, §11 redesignated G.L.c. 19B, as added by St. 1986, c. 655,\n§1, as G.L.c. 19C. The Commission was charged \"... to provide\nfor the investigation and remediation of instances of abuse of\ndisabled persons in the Commonwealth.\" G.L.c. 19C, §2. There\nis nothing in record or in the findings of the trial court\nwhich indicates that the DPPC was a party to the underlying\ncourt action or that the DPPC had failed in its legislative\nresponsibilities. The trial court lacked jurisdiction over the\nDPPC.\nEven if the order of the trial court is applicable to a\nnon-party such as the DPPC, the trial court still lacked the\nauthority to issue an order impinging on the DPPC's\nfunctioning. Neither the record nor the findings of the trial\ncourt indicate that the DPPC had failed its legislatively\nmandated responsibilities. Where, as here, equitable relief\n\n9\narguablyaffects a public agency's exercise of its\ndiscretionary functions, courts must tread lightly in ordering\naction contrary to the agency's interpretation of its own\nregulations. See Matter of McKnighto 406 Mass. 787, 792(1990).\nThere is no demonstrated basis for concluding that the DPPC\nhas broadly abrogated its statutory duties in the face of a\njudicial direction to fulfill them, to justify the issuance of an\norder concerning the carrying out of its executive function.\nSee Bradley v. Commissioner of Mental Health 386 Mass. 363,\n365 (1982), and the cases cited therein.\nConsequently, the trial court lacked the necessary\nstatutory or the inherent authority to issue orders impacting\nthe DPPC's authority pursuant to G.L, c. 19C.\nII, THE PLENARY POWERS CONFERRED ON THE\nRECEIVER BY THE TRIAL COURT REGARDING\nABUSE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING STUDENTS AT\nBEHAVIOR RESEARCH INSTITUTE/ JUDGE\nROTENBERG CENTER ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND\nIN CONFLICT WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE\nDISABLED PERSONS PROTECTION COMMISSION\nPURSUANT TO G.L.C. 19C.\nArticle 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights\nrequires a strict separation of powers between the executive,\n\n10\nlegislative and judicial branches _f government., The order\nof the trial court and the power it confers on the Receiver\nabrogates this principle. The principle as proclaimed by\nArticle 30 is in a most explicit form and calls for a complete\ndivision of all powers among the three branches. Opinion of\nthe Justices, 365 Mass. 639, 640 (1974); New Bedford Standard-\nTimes Publishing Co, v. Clerk of the Third District Court of\nBristol, 377 Mass. 404,410 (1979).\nA court may have the right to order a department of the\nexecutive branch to do that which it has a legal obligation to\ndo. However, a court may not propezly exercise the functions\nof the executive branch of state government. Care and\nProtection of Isaac, 419 Mass. 602, 606 (1995), and the cases\ncited therein.\nit is an established principle that where the means of\nfulfilling its legal obligation is within the discretion of the\npublic agency, the courts normally have no right to dictate to\nthat agency how to fulfill its obligation. Bradley v.\nCommissioner of Mental Health, 386 Mass. 363, 365 (1982);\nWilliams v. Secretary of the Executive Office of Human\nServices, 414 Mass. 551, 570 (1993), and the cases cited therein.\n\n11\nIn the instant case, the scope of the trial court's order is\nvery broad. In addition, the order confers very broad powers\nupon the Receiver. It is this very breadth of scope and\nauthority that makes the order impermissibly applicable to\nthe DPPC and invasive of the DPPC's independent, statutory\nauthority.\nParticularly problematic is the following language\ncontained in the order:\nFirst, the provision of the order which makes the order\napplicable to \"... anyone acting in concert with (the\ndefendant, his agents, attorney and employees)... \" Trial Court\nOrder, Par. 7, Appellant App. p. 1341; Second, the provision of\nthe order which empowers the Receiver to oversee all\ninvestigations conducted by DMR. Trial Court Order, Par. 19(5),\nAppellant App. p. 1346; and Third, the provision of the order\nwhich enjoins the Defendant, (and any one acting in concert\nwith him) from issuing any orders or directions which\ninterfere with outstanding treatment orders or decisions\nissued by the trial court. Trial Court Order, Par. 10, Appellant\nApp. p. 1342.\nWithout more specification each of these provisions of\nthe trial court's order impermissibly impinges upon the\n\n12\nstatutoryauthorityof the DPPC. The prescriptionof\n\"concertedactivity\" is applicableto the DPPC. By dint of its\nstatutoryauthority,the DPPCis empoweredto assignabuse\ninvestigationsto be conductedby other agencies,including\nDMR,G.L.¢. 19C,§§4[b]and4[c];118CMR§4.04(2) &(3);\nempowered to oversee all abuse investigations, G.L.e. 19C,\n§4(b)and 4(c); 118 CMR §4.08 & §5.03; and empowered to\ndetermine the existence of abuse of a disabled person,\nG.L.c. 19C §5; 118 CMR §5.01 (2)(C). In addition, the DPPC is\nauthorized to ensure the provision of protective services by\nservice providing agencies, such as DMR and BRI/JRC, to\nprevent further abuse in cases investigated under its\nauspices. G.L.c. 19C, §6; 188 CMR §7.01 & §7.02. Consequently,\nby the explicit terms of its enabling statute, the DPPC works\nwith DMR to investigate and remediate cases of abuse of\ndisabled individuals; the DPPC has authority to oversee all\nabuse investigations, including those conducted by DMR; and\nthe DPPC has authority to determine the existence of abuse,\neven if it occurs as part of a court-approved treatment plan.\nIt should be noted that in the course of conducting past\ninvestigations involving students at BRI/JRC, the trial court's\nand the DPPC's determinations regarding the applicability of\n\n13\n\"abuse\" to treatment orders have differed. The DPPC\npreviously has brought this issue to the attention of both the\ntrial court and this Court. See Amicus Addendum, pp. 1 to 6.\nThe order of the trial court abrogates the independent\nauthority of the DPPC to operate in each of these areas.\nSpecific statutory and regulatory language places the\nauthority to assign and oversee investigations of abuse, to\ndetermine the existence of abuse, and to ensure the provision\nof protective services to the abused disabled person within the\nsole discretion of the DPPC. G.L.c. 19C; i18 CMR §§1.00 et seq.\nConsequently, if a case reported to the DPPC involves a student\nat BRI/IRC, the statute and regulations authorize the DPPC\nalone: first, to determine which agency will conduct the\ninvestigation: second, to oversee the investigation, even if its\nconducted by DMR; third, to determine whether abuse can be\nsubstantiated; and fourth, to ensure the implementation of\nremedial protective services by the service providing agency.\nBy granting the Receiver plenary authority over abuse\ninvestigation_ involving BRI/JRC students, the trial court's\norder supplants the statutory authority of the DPPC. Similarly,\nby precluding the issuance of orders and directives by the\nDPPC which are at variance with treatment orders and\n\n14\ndecisions of the trial court, the order impermissibly impinges\non the authority of the DPPC to determine the existence of\nabuse and to ensure the provision of protective services to\nremediate the abuse.\nThe trial court substitutes a judicially created\nmechanism - the Receiver - for a legislatively created\none - the DPPC - to oversee the investigation and remediation\nof abuse involving BRI/JRC students. The trial court is\nwithout authority to exercise the function of the DPPC. See In\nthe Matter of McKnight, 406 Mass. \"/87, 792 (1990). Within a\nvariety of different contexts, this Court has held that judicial\nattempts to control the performance of statutorily established\ndiscretionary duties of an executive or administrative officer\nto be unsound and extra-judicial in nature. See Stretch v.\nTimilty, 309 Mass. 267, 270 - 271 (1941), and the cases cited\ntherein. Indeed the trial court's order \"... constitutes an\nimpermissible 'poaching by the judicial branch on executive\nand legislative territories'.\" Guardianship of Anthony, 402\nMass. 723, 727 (1988), and the cases cited therein.\n\n15\nFor the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the\ntrial court should be reversed and the relief granted should be\nvacated.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDisabled Persons\nProtection Commission\ntf// Ralph T.

We accept the conclusions of the investigators in those cases. In addition to\nreviewing them as cases involving particular disabled persons, we have reviewed them, as\nrequired by M.G.L.c. 19C, §8, to determine \"the nature and extent of such abuse\" and, as\nrequired by that section, \"to make recommendations with respect to such occurrences.\"\nFollowing consultation with the staff of the Commission in conjunction with review of the\ninvestigation reports, we make the following recommendations in adda'tion to those\npresented in the individual cases.\n1. Based on the information contained in conclusion 1below, the Commission\nrecommends that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, using\nits power of general superintendance of the courts, review the\nmonitoring system developed by the Bristol Probate and Family\nCourt in order to insure the elimination or reduction of risk to\nstudents at BRI from the application of aversive procedures. The\nCommission recommends that this review include determining the thoroughness,\nindependence and effectiveness of the monitoring, including the randomness of\nvisits to BRI by the Court Monitor. Given the controversial nature of the treatment\nprovided at BILl, the review should also seek to insure future appropriate public\nexamination of the results of monitoring at BRI so that public scrutiny can serve to\nenhance the safety of the students at the program without unduly impinging on the\nprivacy rights of the students.\n2. Based on the information contained in conclusion 2 below, the Commission\nrecommends that the Bristol County Probate and Family Court,\nwhich has assumed the responsibility of monitoring the use of\naversive treatment at BRI, should, as part of this responsibility,\nexamine the system of providing medical care in place at BRI. If the\nCou_ determines a need, it should make appropriate orders to insure that the\nstudents at BRI have available to them a system of responsive medical care which\nincludes appropriate protocols for record-keeping, communication, and the specific\nADD. p. 1\n\nresponsibilities of the BRI medical staff, including the physician retained by BRI,\nregarding the application of aversive treatment.\n3. Based on the information contained in conclusion 3 below, the Commission\nrecommends that the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, as\npart of its monitoring process, should insure that the court monitor\nattends all functional diagnostic trials as part of the monitor's regular duties\nand provide to the Court and all parties a written report on the conduct and results\nof the trials.\n4. Based on the information contained in conclusion 4 below, the Commission\nrecommends that the Bristol Probate and Family Court reopen the\nquestion of the need for the use of aversive procedures which obtain\ntheir value from the infliction of pain or discomfort.\nThese recommendations are based upon the following conclusions which we reach\nafter reviewing the reports comprising the Commissioners' Investigation.\nThe Supreme Judicial Court should review the monitoring system developed by the Bristol\nProbate and Family Court due to questions which arose in the investigation about that\nmonitoring.\n1. It is concluded in one of the reports that a risk of abuse to students at BRI exists.\nThis is based on several findings. These include:\n•the failure ofa BRI physician to attend functional diagnostic trials to determine\nmedical contmindications, if any, and to review relevant court orders authorizing\nthe use of aversive procedures. (For example, the physician could not recollect\nwhether court-ordered regular weekly medical examinations were required when, in\nfact, they were.)\n• as discussed below regarding recommendation 3, the court monitor does not\nattend all functonal diagnostic trials during which the effect and effectiveness of\ndifferent aversive procedures is determined.\n• the investgation reports contains statements by former BRI staff which raise the\nquestion of risk and the monitoring system presently being used. Statements by\ntwo former staff persons raised the question of whether the court monitor visits\nBR/randomly or at the same time each month or week, or, in fact, how often the\ncourt monitor visits BRI. A former BRI staff person recalled a conversation\nbetween the two BRI adminstrators about the court monitor not being informed that\nart aversive procedure had been applied prior to court authorization, and also\nrecalled a conversation between the court monitor and a BRI administrator, during\nwhich the monitor stated that he was not aware that a particular aversive was being\nutilized with a student and that he had not been notified.\nThe court monitor's assertion of a privilege (which the Commission believes does\nnot apply in this instance) also reduced the Commission's ability to determine the answers\nto these questions.\n2. The investigations conducted by DPPC investigators as part of the\nCommissioners' Investigation, as well as another 19C investigation conducted by the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation under the oversight of the Commission, reveal problems\nin the system of providing and monitoring medical care at BRI. Th/s isan issue\nindependent of any dispute about the value of aversive treatment. In summary, the\nfollowing conclusions, which support recommendation 2, were reached by investigators\nregarding the system of providing medical care at BR/.\n2 ADD p.2\n\na. In a case investigated by DMR, which involved the death of a student following\npoor response by BRI to her behavior and symptoms, the Investigator noted several\nfailings of BRI staff in responding to the critical needs of the disabled person for whom\nthey were caretakers. These failings included:\n•an unacceptable delay in initiating observation and/or monitoring given the\nbehavior and symptoms of the student;\n• inadequate documentation;\n•insufficient gathering of recent medical history to assist in assessments;\n• poor medical judgments, including:\na registered nurse attributing symptoms to behavioral issues rather than\nmedical ones, contrary to the student's behavioral history, resulting not only\nin delay of appropriate medical response but in the application of aversive\ntreatment during a period when the student was sick;\na decision by the registered nurse to delay calling for emergency medical\nintervention\ninadequate interventions by nursing staff\n•the BRI registered nurse involved in the matter was not certified as an emergency\nschool nurse/teacher as required by Rhode Island for private special education\nfacilities such as BRI.\n•poor communication between shifts, resulting in delay in treament which was\ndetermined to be a contributory cause of the death of the student; and\n•lack of policies regarding required responses to medical problems.\nb. In matters investigated by the Commission, concerns were also noted regarding\nthe system of providing medical care. These include:\n•the physician retained by BRI who determines the medical appropriateness of the\nuse of aversive procedures on BRI students, does not, as part of his review\nprocess, attend functional diagnostic trials of the application of various aversive\ntreatments where it is determined which aversive treatment is most effective in\nobtaining the desired change in behavior.\n• the BRI-retained physician does not examine a copy of relevant court orders\nauthorizing aversive treatment as part of his determination, although the orders\ncontain the only official statement of the treatment which the court has authorized.\n• the Commission is unable to determine whether Dr. John Daignault, the court\nmonitor of the provision of aversive treatment, attends functional diagnostic trials of\naversives applied tOstudents at BRI as a regular part of his duties; however, he did\nnot attend the trial which was examined as part of one of the investigations.\n•BRI staff did not follow hospital orders requiting bed rest for a student who had\nsuffered a fracture, resulting in the student experiencing pain while being forced to\ncommute to and attend the program at BRI during his recovery.\n3. The court accepted the responsibility to monitor the application of aversive\ntreatment, and, to fulfill this crucial responsibility, the court established the position of a\ncourt monitor to act as the court's agent to perform such monitoring. Dr. Daignanlt's\nfailure to attend all functional diagnostic trials deprives the court of information which can\n3 ADD. p.3\n\ninsure adherence to the paremeters for application of aversive treatment which the court has\nestablished to insure the safety of the students at BR.I.\n4. We conclude that the use of spatula spanks and finger pinches as an aversive\ntreatanent is abuseperse pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L.c. 19C. The basis for this\nconclusion is as follows:\na. The court order which authorizes the use of spatula spanks and finger pinches is\nissued pursuant to the judicial rule of substituted judgment. In the context of BILl\naaadtreatment provided to its students, a \"substituted judgment\" order is one by\nwlfich the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, after concluding that a student\nis unable to make treatment decisions for him- or herself, substitutes its judgment\nfor that of the student based on what the court determines the student would decide\nfor him- or herself if he/she had the capacity to make that decision. This judgment\nof the court relates to consent to the aversive treatment, not whether or not the\ntreatment is \"abuse\" as defined in M.G.L.c. 19C.1 The substituted judgment order\ndoes not invalidate or revise c. 19C. 2\nb. Based upon the language of the DPPC statute and regulations, the concept of\n\"abuse\" under c. 19C does not require an intention to abuse on the part of an abuser\nin order for an act or omission to be considered abuse. Similarly, a disabled person\ncannot consent to being abused.\nc. The records reviewed by DPPC Investigators and the statements of present and\nformer employees of BRI provide compelling evidence that certain students\nsuffered bruising as a result of the application of spatula spanks and finger pinches.\nFor example, BRI records and the statements of BRI staff indicate that spatula\nspanks and finger pinches were used during the functional diagnostic trial of a BRI\nstudent. Cer',ain BRI records indicate that bruising was caused by spatula spanks\nand finger pinches, as described below. Based upon a review of the aversive\nprocedures applied to students, the Commission considers it reasonable to conclude\nthat bruising resulted from the application of spatula spanks and/or finger pinches.\nThat conclusion, together with information obtained from BRI staff that the\napplication of spatula spanks and f'mger pinches would be discontinued on areas\nalready bruised from the application of those aversives, supports the conclusion that\nstudents who were the subject of allegations in this case suffered \"serious physical\ninjury\" as a result of the application of spatula spanks and/or finger pinches.\nIn addition:\n•BRI body check nurses notes dated 6-23-89 indicate that a student was observed\nas having bruising to the legs, arms, and back, as well as finger pinches to the\nhands, arms, and feet. On this day, the student was taken \"off physicals\" to the\nright foot. This essentially means that no physical aversive procedures were to be\napplied to her right foot due to the existence of then-current injuries. According to\nrecords indicating the amount of physical aversives applied on 6-23-89, it is\ndocumented that the student received 95 spatula spanks.\n•The total applications of physical aversives as documented in BRI documents\ndated June 26, 1989 indicates 20 applications of SIBIS, 17 spatula spanks, 1\ncontinuous finger pinch, and 83 \"physicals\", which were not specfically defined in\nthe record.\n• The body check nursing notes for 6-27 reveal that the student was observed as\nhaving \"bruised calves -sp.[spanks], fps [finger pinches] feet arms, sp.[spanks]\n1In relevant part, chapter 19C defines abuse as \"an act or omission which results in serious physical or\nemotional injury to a disabled person...\".\n2Chapter 19C became effective on March 24, 1987. The existence or provisions of c. 19C are not cited in\nthe court's order.\n4 ADD. p. 4\n\nbutt & thighs.\" The body check nursing notes further indicate that the application\nof physical aversives to the calves and left outer thigh was discontinued.\nlit is noteworthy that bruising was noted in BRI records for June 23 and June 27,\nyet the body check nurses notes for June 26 cites no bruising whatsoever.]\n•\"Ihe Tabulation of Physical Aversives chart for 6-27-89 indicates that the student\nreceived 99 spatula spanks, 114 applications of SIBIS, 243 finger pinches, 7\nspanks, and 8 muscle squeezes. A BRI document identified as [data regarding the\nstudent] 6-27 indicates that the student received 99 spatula spanks, 112\napplications of SIBIS, and 217 physicals (non-specific).\n•The body check nurses notes for June 30, 1989 indicate that aversives were\ndiscontinued to the left outer thighs and back of calves, that \"bruises arms thighs\nand calves fading\" and that \"finger pinches arms and feet healing\".\n•The body check nurses notes for 7-3-89 state, in part, \"scattered bruises\nespecially R. calf. Discussed with [staff] who is expected to attend [student]'s\nconsequating; agrees to avoid calves and concentrate on relatively bruise free butts.\"\n• a present staff person stated that she observed bruises on the body of a student on\nareas approved by the court for the application of spatula spanks.\n•a former BRI staff person stated that the use of spatula spanks left welts, bruises,\nbroken skin, and marks.\n• a former BRI staff person stated that in June, 1989 she observed multiple brusing\nover many parts of a student's body as a result of the application of physical\naversives.\n• a former BRI staff person stated that she observed much braising to a student's\nouter extremities.\n•a former BR1 staff person stated that in the spring of 1989 she observed extensive\nbruising to a student's arms and thighs.\n•a former BRI staff person stated that following a day of probing, a student\nremained at the residence for '%couple of days\" following this episode because of\nextensive bruising.\n•a present BRI staff person stated that she has observed bruising to a student as the\nresult of spatula spanks.\n•a former BRI staff person stated that she observed marks and bruises on a\nstudent's body as a result of the application of spatula spanks, pinches, and muscle\nsqueezes.\nWhile the question of the clinical effectiveness of aversive procedures was not\naddressed as part of this investigation, the Commission makes this recommendation for the\nfollowing reasons:\na. In authorizing the use of aversive procedures via a substituted judgment order,\nthe Court did not and has not yet considered the relationship of such orders and the\ndefinition of \"abuse\" set forth in M.G.L.c. 19C. However, the legal determination\nby the DPPC that the application of spatula spanks and finger pinches is abuse per\nse as defined by c. 19C (discussed below) causes .theCommission to recommend to\nthe Court that it review whether these procedures, as well as other aversive\nprocedures, should continue to be utilized as a treatment modality.\nb. The court should review the need for the use of painful aversives procedures in\nthe context of treatments developed since the authorization of such procedures\nwhich could obviate the need for painful aversives and allow treatment for the\nstudents at BRI which is not based on the application of pain or discomfort\nc. The expert consultant for the Commission, James Luiselli, Ed.D, notes in his\nreport (which is appended to the report regarding cases #10869 and #10975)\nseveral issues regarding the conduct of the functional diagnostic trial for the student\nwho was the subject of that report which should be considered by the Court in\nADD. p. 5\n5\n\ndetermining the present need and effectiveness of aversive procedures. These\nissues include:\n• difficulty in interpreting the data obtained during the functional diagnostic trial\nregarding the relative effectiveness of the aversive procedures which were utilized;\n• the def'mition and selection of the behaviors which were observed and responded\nto with those procedures;\n•the structure of the data, which does not allow for interpretation since specific data\ndoes not correspond to summary information;\n• the lack of definitions for certain notations in the BRI records; and\n• discrepancies between data regarding the same event but obtained from different\nsources [a problem noted in the report regarding cases #10869 and #10975].\nThe consultant also notes concem about the conclusion of BRI about the\neffectiveness of SIBIS over spa_la spank by noting that the effectiveness was\nrelative to the other aversive procedures used in the trial, and not absolute.\nWe make this conclusion knowing that the students to which spatula spanks and\nfinger pinches were and could be applied are self-abusive and that the injuries which they\ninflict on themselves could be more harmful than the bruising caused by the aversive\nprocedures. It is our position that, given advances in behavioral sciences and the fact that\nM.G.L.c. 19C was not and has not been considered by the court in its decisions regarding\nthe use of aversive procedures, the court should now reevaluate the need for using painful\naversives which cause serious physical or emotional injury as defined by c. 19C.\nAccordingly, we will direct that the reports completed by the Commission and this\nstatement be forwarded to the Supreme Judicial Court, the Bristol County Probate and\nFamily Court. as well as to the Executive Office of Health and Haman Services, the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation (both as required by c. 19C) and the Governor's\nCommission on Mental Retardation.\nthleen M.

Mentally retarded persons; appointment of guardians; commit-\nment; treatment with antipsyehottc medication\n(a) A parent of a mentally retarded person, two or more relatives or friends\nof a mentally retarded person, a nonprofit corporation organized under the\nlaws of the commonwealth whose corporate charter authorizes the corpora-\ntion to act as guardian of a mentally retarded person, or any agency within\nthe executive offices of human services or educational affairs may file a\npetition in the probate court asking to have a guardian appointed for such\nmentally retarded person. If, after notice as provided in section seven and a\nhearing, the court finds that the person is mentally retarded to the degree that\nhe is incapable of making informed decisions with respect to the conduct of\nhis personal and financial affairs, that failure to appoint a guardian would\n: create an unreasonable risk to his health, welfare and property, and that\nappointment of a conservator pursuant to section sixteen B would not elimi-\nnatesuch risk, it may appoint a guardian of his person and estate. The court\nshallnot so find unless the petition is accompanied by a report from a clinical\nteam consisting of a physician, a licensed psychologist and a social worker,\n: each of whom is experienced in the evaluation of mentally retarded persons,\nthat it has examined the said person and has determined that he is mentally\nretarded to the degree that he is incapable of making informed decisions with\nrespect to the conduct of his personal and financial affairs. The court shall\nnot. pursuant to this section, appoint as guardian any person or organization\nwhich, in its opinion, has any interest, responsibilities or powers which would\n• .tender such person or organization unable to perform the duties of guardian\nInthe best interest of the mentally retarded person. A copy of such appoint-\n: merit shall be sent by mail by the register to the department of mental\nretardation. The court may require additional testimony as to the existence\nand degree of mental retardation, and may require the person subject to the\npetition to submit to examination.\n(b) No guardian so appointed shall have the authority to cause to admit or\ncommit such mentally retarded person to a mental heahh or retardation\nfacility unless the court specifically finds the same to be in the best interests\nof such person and specifically authorizes such admission or commitment by\nits order or decree. The court shall not authorize such admission or commit.\nment except after a hearing for the purposes of which counsel shall be\nprovided for any indigent mentally retarded person.\n(c) No guardian so appointed shall have the authority to consent to treat.\nment with antipsychotic medication, provided that the court shall authorize\nsuch treatment when it (1) specifically finds using the substituted judgment\nstandard that the person, if competent, would consent to such treatment and\n(2) specifically approves and authorizes an antlpsychotic medication treat.\nment plan by its order or decree. The court shall not authorize such\ntreatment plan except after a hearing for the purpose of which counsel shall\nbe provided for any indigent mentally retarded person. Said hearing shall be\nheld as soon as is practicable; provided, however, that if the petitioner\nrequests a temporary order on the grounds that the welfare of the ward\nrequires an immediate authorization of treatment with antipsychotic medi-\ncations, the court shall act on such request in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in section fourteen.\n\"DD. p.20\n\nGUARDIANS AND CONSERVATORS 201 § 6A\n(d) The court may delegate to a guardian the authority to monitor the\ntreatment process to ensure that an antipsychotic medication treatment plan\nis followed, provided a guardian is readily available for such purpose. Ap-\nproval of a treatment plan shall not be withheld, however, because a guardian\nis not available to serve as monitor. In such circumstances, the court shall\nappoint a suitable person to monitor the treatment process to ensure that the\nantipsychotic medication treatment plan is followed. Reasonable expenSe\nincurred in such monitoring may be paid out of the estate of such person, by .:\nthe petitioner, or, subject to appropriation, by the commonwealth, as may be \"\ndetermined by the court. _±_\n(e) At a hearing relative to authority to cause to admit or commit or -2_\nauthority to administer antipsychotic medication, the court shall require the -€._\nattendance of such allegedly mentalIy retarded person unless the court fin_ ;'/-_:_\nthat there exists extraordinary circumstances requiring his absence, in whi._. _]\nevent the attendance of his counsel shall suffice provided that the court may _._\nbase its findings exclusively upon affidavits and other documentary evidenC_\nif it (1) determines, after careful inquiry and upon representations of cotm-_.\nthat there are no contested issues of fact and (2) includes in its findings_m¢\nreason that oral testimony was not required. The court may also appoint ot_\" I\nor more persons experienced in the evaluation, care and treatment of .men to' •\nly retarded persons to examine such person and report their conclusmnS .._•\nthe court. ,_sJ\n(f) Reasonable expenses incurred in any examination conducted pursuant\nto this section shall be paid by the petitioner, the estate of such persons, or by\nthe commonwealth as the court may determine.\n(g) The guardian of a mentally retarded person shall act to protect the\nwelfare of such person and may utilize the services of agencies and individu-\nals to provide necessary and desirable social and protective services of\ndifferent types appropriate to such person including, but not limited to,\ncounseling services, advocacy services, legal services, and other aid as he\ndeems to be in the interest of such person.\n(h) Any privilege established by section one hundred and thirty-five of\nchapter one hundred and twelve or by section twenty B of chapter two\nhundred and thirty-three, relating to confidential communications, shall not\nprohibit the filing of reports or affidavits, or the giving of testimony, pursuant\nto this chapter, for the purpose of obtaining treatment of a mentally retarded\nperson; provided, however, that such person has been informed prior to\nmaking such communication that they may be used for such purpose and has\nwaived the privilege.\nAdded by St.1974, c. 845, § 4.

Whether a Settlement Agreement, which resolved litigation between\nthe Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, Inc. _and the predecessor in interest to\nthe Deparlanent of Mental Retardation (hereinafter \"DMR\"), and which provided an\neffective framework for relations between the JRC and the agencies of the\nCommonwealth which regulated the JRC from 1987 to 1993, included no\nprovision that was \"sufficiently unambiguous to form a basis for a contempt\ncitation\"?\"\n2. Whether, as a matter of law, the Trial Court abused its discretion in\ndenying the motion of the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation\n(hereinafter the \"'Commissioner\" to compel the psychiatric examination of a JRC\nStudent over the objections of that Student's parent?\n3. Whether the finding of the Trial Court that the Commissioner's\ncommunications with the parents of Students at the JRC were designed to alarm the\nparents and interfere with the JRC's relations with the families of the Students was\nclearly erroneous?\n4. Whether the findings of the Trial Court that the Commissioner had\ninflicted harm on the Students of the JRC are clearly erroneous?\n5. Whether, even if the Trial Court's contempt findings were legally and\nfactually sound, the Trial Court abused its discretion in appointing a receiver?\n6. Whether the Commissioner has overcome the heavy burden that he\nmust meet in order to demonstrate that he is entitled to a stay of the Trial Court's\norder pending appeal?\nJThe JudgeRotenbergEducational Center, Inc. was previously known as the Behavior Research\nInstitute and willbe hereinafter referred toasthe \"JRC\" or\"BRI\".\n:BriefOf The Appellant Commissioner Of Mental Retardation (hereinafterreferred toas\n\"'Commissioner's Brief\")at I.\n\n7. Whether the Trial Court erred in ordering the Commissioner to\ncompensate the Class Of All Students At The JRC, Their Parents and Guardians for\nattorneys fees and expenses incurred in responding to the Commissioner's bad faith\nattempts to terminate the JRC program?\n8. Whether an order of a Single Justice of the Appeals Court that\nimplements an unjustified decision by the Commissioner to terminate treatment\noptions at the JRC should be vacated?\n9. Whether this Court should award attorneys fees to the Class Of All\nStudents at the JRC, Their Parents and Guardians for defending this frivolous\nappeal?\n2\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nThe Class Of ALl Students At The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center,\nInc., Their Parents And Guardians (hereinafter referred to as \"the JRC Families\")\nhave a vital interest in the preservation of the treatment option offered by the JRC.\nThe Students at the JRC constitute \"an extremely vulnerable population\" who are\n\"the largest collection of most difficult to treat clients in one program in the nation\".\nF. 267, App. 1276.

These obligations\nare clearly stated and were repeatedly violated by the Commissioner. (pp. 7-10).\nEven if there were some legitimacy to the Commissioner's argument that he does\nnot understand the meaning of the term \"good faith\", the meaning of that term is\ninformed by the actions undertaken by the Office For Children that formed the basis\nfor the litigation that led to the Settlement Agreement. The fact that the actions\nundertaken by the Commissioner to attack the JRC in significant respects duplicated\nthe conduct undertaken by the Office For Children demonstrates that the\nCommissioner not only was aware that his conduct violated the Settlement\nAgreement, but also demonstrates that the violation was intentional. (pp. 10-11).\nThe Trial Court properly denied the Commissioner's motions to seek\nadditional discovery and to strike certain testimony offered by the JRC Fami!ies.\nThe Students at the JRC had been previously subjected to unnecessary and intrusive\nmedical and psychiatric evaluations provided ample basis for the Trial Cou:t's\ndenial of the Commissioner's motion. (pp. 10-12). Moreover, the Comndssioner\nmisstates the relief that he sought at trial and, with respect to both inn'.ions, now\nclaims to be prejudiced by the denial of motions that he did not, in fact, make.\n(pp.13-14).\nThe bankruptcy of the Commissioner's attempt to literally relitigate each and\nevery finding of fact found by the Trial Court is demonstrated by his failure to\nsatisfy the burden that he must meet to challenge the Trial Court's findings that the\nCommissioner's communications with the JRC Families were calculated to alarm\nthe Families and that the JRC Families were injured as a result of the\n5\n\nCommissioner's conduct. The Commissioner's argument misstates the standard of\nreview to deny the great deference to which the findings of the Trial Court are\nentitled. (pp.15-30). The inflammatory nature of the false and unsubstantiated\nstatements contained in the Commissioner's communications with the JRC Families\ncompels the conclusion that they were intended to alarm the JRC families. (pp. 18-\n23). Similarly, the record amply supports the Trial Courts findings of injury to the\nJRC Families. (pp.23-30).\nThe Commissioner's blatant disregard for the injury he has inflicted on the\nJRC Families demonstrates that he ,,,.'ill not be constrained from continuing his\nregulator)' assault on the JRC by any concern for the welfare of the Students. This\nthreat of imminent harm not only justifies the appointment of a receiver (pp.31-33).\nbut also justifies denial of the Commissioner's request for a stay pending appeal.\n(pp.33-34).\nThe Commissioner fails to demonstrate that the Trial Court abosed its\ndiscretion in awarding attorneys fees. The record demonstrates that the Trial Court\nexercised billing judgment in assessing the fees awarded and found the\ncontributions of counsel to the JRC Families throughout the certification process to\nbe valuable. (pp.35-42).\nThis Court should vacate the order of the Single Justice which implements\nthe Commissioner's bad faith decision to terminate treatment options at the JRC as\nit improperly was granted and continues to harm the Students at the JRC. (pp. 42-\n44).\nBecause the Commissioner's appeal is frivolous, this Court should award\nthe JRC Families double attorneys fees and expenses for responding to the\nCommissioner's appeal. (pp.44).\n\nARGUMENT\n1. THE TRIAL COURT'S CONCLUSION THAT\nTHE COMMISSIONER'S CONDUCT\nCONSTITUTED CONTEMPT IS SUPPORTED\nBY THE LAW AND BY THE EVIDENCE.\nThe Commissioner's challenge to the Trial Court's judgment that his\nconduct was \"in contempt of this Court's the Settlement Agreement dated December\n12, 1986 '''_ is predicated upon a fundamentally flawed analysis of the law and a\ncalculated mi_tatement of the record of this proceeding. The gravamen of the\nCommissioner's argument is that, notwithstanding the fact that from 1987 to 1993\nthe Settlement Agreement provided an effective framework to govern relations\namong the parties, as a matter of law, neither the Settlement Agreement as a ',,,'hole\nnor an)' of the cited provisions are \"sufficiently unambiguous to form the basis for a\ncontempt citation\". Under Massachusetts law, there is contempt when there is a\nTM\n\"clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command\". Warren\nGardens Housing Cooperative v. Clark, 420 Mass. 699, 700 (1995) (citations\nomitted). Contrary to the Commissioner's argument, the findings of the Trial Court\ndemonstrate a manifest defiance of clear commands of the Trial Court as well as\nconscious efforts, including the knowing use of perjured testimony (F.11-12.\nApp. 1284-1290), to subvert the decree. Accordingly, the Trial Court's finding that\nCommissioner Campbell's conduct is contemptuous is well supported by the record\nand the Commissioner's contention should be rejected by this Court.\n'_Judgment And Order _1. App. 1340.\n_,aCommissioner's Brief at 37-60.\n\nIn order to prevent a repeat of the injury inflicted upon BRI and the JRC\nFamilies,\" the Settlement Agreement provides, in relevant part, that:\n¶A of the Settlement Agreement provides that \"that\nportion of the [treatment] plan which involves the use\nof aversive or extraordinary procedures may be\nimplemented only upon authorization of the Court in\na temporary guardianship proceeding . . . utilizing\nthe substituted judgment criteria\". App. 121\"\n_B-2 of the Settlement Agreement provides that \"Dr.\nJohn Daignault shall be responsible for overseeing\nBRI's compliance with all applicable state\nregulations, except to the extent that those regulations\ninvolve treatment procedures authorized by the Court\nin accordance with Paragraph A.\". App. 126.;\n¢B-2 of the Settlement Agreement further provides\nthat \"'Dr. Daignault shall arbitrate an}' disputes\nbetween the parties, and in the event that any part}'\ndisagrees with an}' decision or recommendation of\nDr. Daignault, the matter shall be submitted to the\nCourt for resolution.\" ld.:\n_C-3 of the Settlement Agreement provides that\n\"Upon the execution of this agreement, intake at BRI\nfor new clients shall be reopened and shall not be\nimpermissibly obstructed during the pendency of this\nagreement.\" App. 126.-127; and\n_'L of the Settlement Agreement provides that \"'Each\nparty shall discharge its obligations in good faith.\nApp. 133.\"\nThe Settlement Agreement also provided for payment of the Plaintiffs\" attorneys\nfees in the amount of $580,605.25. App. 131.\nNotwithstanding the straightfo_'ard nature of the provisions of the Settlement\nAgreement, the Commissioner repeatedly engaged in direct violations of the Trial\n_ 'Thepurposeof the Settlement Agreementwas \"to protect the JRC. the Students and Families\nfrom future bad faith conduct bystateofficials v,hile safeguarding thestate's interest in the v.elfare\nof children\". F. 13, App. 1211. According to the Commissioner. \"[t]he Settlement Agreement\nimposed man:,'obligations on BRI. In return. OFC agreed to restore BRI's licenses, to permit\nintake of net clients, togive BRI equalconsideration with other providers in referring ne'.', clients\nfor placement at public expense, and to pas. $580.605.25 in attorneys' fees\". Commissioner's\nBriefat5. Exceptfor thereference toattorneys' fees. toread the Commissioner's description, one\nmight think that itwas JRC andthe JRC Families that had been found to have been acting in trad\nfaith rather thanthe OFC.\n8\n\nCourt's order, t2 The record at trial documents an extensive campaign of false and\ndefamatory letters intended to interfere with the relationship of the JRC with the\nout-of-state funding agencies that refer students to the JRC. F. 77, App. 1228.\nThis campaign was successful in reducing the enrollment at the JRC (F. 290, App.\n1282) in violation of the \"unequivocal command\" of the Settlement Agreement that\nthe Commissioner not impermissibly interfere with intake at the JRC. As a result of\nthe consequential reduction in referrals and loss of revenue, the quality of the JRC\nprogram has suffered \"all to the great harm and detriment of JRC and the students\".\nld.\nThe Commissioner engaged in further violations of unequivocal commands\nof the Trial Court by refusing to acknowledge the authority of Dr. Daignault to\nserve as monitor and by refusing to meet with Dr. Daignault to mediate issues as\nrequested by the JRC. F. 80-89, App. 1229-1231. After the Trial Court ordered\nthat the Honorable George N. Hurd be appointed as mediator, an agreement among\nthe parties was reached as a result of the efforts of Judge Hurd, \"'DMR then\npromptly proceeded to violate material provisions of this agreement\". F. 231-233,\nApp. 1268. These refusals of the Commissioner to negotiate is not only an express\nviolation of the terms of an \"unequivocal command\", but also manifest evidence of\nbad faith. Se_._U£e.S.v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 799 F.2d 281,\n290 (1986) (holding that \"In deciding whether bad faith exists, one crucial factor\nwould be the willingness of a party to enter into discussions designed to resolve the\ndispute; another would be the conduct of the parties. A party's refusal to bargain in\ngood faith can ser,,,e as a basis for a court imposed resolution of the case.\").\nZ:TheCommissioner also contends that \"the settlement agreement doesnot prohibit DMR from\nregulating BRI\". Commissioner's Brief at 39. While there may be no \"unequivocalcommand\"\nthat the Commissioner refrain from regulating the JRC, the Settlement Agreement clearl._\nspecifies the manner inv,hich the Commissioner shall undertakethat regulation.\n\nThe Commissioner's contention that the requirement that he act in good faith\nis too subjective and ambiguous to constitute an unequivocal command is equally\nwithout merit. It is well settled in Massachusetts that Courts have the jurisdiction to\ninterpret and enforce a good faith requirement in a settlement agreement. Se.___ge\nWarNer Insurance Co. v. Commissioner of Insurance, 406 Mass. 354, 362 n.9\n(1990). Moreover, even assuming ar_g_uendo that there was some deficiency in the\nCommissioner's understanding of the term \"good faith\", the facts and\ncircumstances of the instant case provide more than sufficient guidance as to the\nnature of his obligation. See United States v. Board of Education Of Chicago,\nsu_v.p.L_a,t 292 (stating that \"good faith\" is \"not a term that exists in a vacuum, the\nnature and circumstances of the underlying obligation help to determine what\nconstitutes good faith.\").\nThe interpretation of the requirements imposed by the Settlement Agreement\nis informed by the circumstances surrounding its creation, the previous litigation\nbrought by the plaintiffs in this proceeding against Mary K. Leonard, Director of\nthe Office For Children (hereinafter OFC) (DMR's predecessor in interest). Thus.\nJudge Rotenberg's Findings In Support Of Preliminary Injunctive Relief in the\nprevious litigation involving the Office For Children are instructive as to what\nconduct might constitute bad faith.\nIn his Findings, Judge Rotenberg determined that Mau, K. Leonard had\nacted in bad faith by employing tactics nearly identical to those employed by\nCommissioner Campbell against the JRC. Judge Rotenberg found that Mary. K.\nLeonard was acting in bad faith when she recruited a biased panel to evaluate the\nJRC program. F. 79-80, App. 106. The Commissioner paid homage to this tactic\nby rec,'uiting a team in which the co-leader signed a document equating the use of\naversive techniques with political torture and which the Trial Court determined to be\n\"incapable of doing a fair. impartial and unbiased review of a program which uses\n10\n\nthose very techniques\". F. 151, App. 1245; F. 163, App. 1248. Judge Rotenberg\nalso found that the Office For Children acted in bad faith when it presented an\naltered document in response to a discovery request from plaintiffs counsel (F. 69,\nApp. 103-104), an action that is echoed in DMR's providing plaintiff's counsel\nwith an altered version of the Rivendell RFP. F. 145-147, App. 1244-1245.\nPerhaps the most disturbing parallel can be found in Judge Rotenberg's\nconclusion that Mar)' K. Leonard acted in bad faith when, just as the Commissioner\ndid in the instant case, she issued treatment orders that were \"unsubstantiated\" and\n\"based upon no medical foundation and without regard to the consequences of\nthose Orders\" thereby playing \"Russian Roulette with the lives and safety of the\nstudents at BRI\". F. 82, App. 107. Similarly, Commissioner Campbell terminated\nthe Specialized Food Program and failed to identify any medical evidence\nsupporting his decision which resulted in a \"dramatic increase\" in the health\nthreatening behaviors of two students. F. 251, App. 1271; F. 298, App. 1284-\n1285.\nThe JRC Families find it incomprehensible that the Commissioner, who is\ncharged with regulating the care provided to highly vulnerable individuals, in\nessence holds himself to a lower standard of knowledge of the law than is\npresumed of parties to a routine commercial contract, where there is an implied\ncovenant of good faith. See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Associates, 411\nMass. 453, 473 (1991) (citations omitted). The fact that the Commissioner\nemployed tactics in his regulatory assault against the JRC that were virtually\nidentical to those employed by Mary Kay Leonard demonstrates that not only was\nthe Commissioner aware that his conduct violated the Settlement Agreement but\nalso that the violation was intentional.\n11\n\nII.THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED\nTHE MOTION OF THE COMMISSIONER TO\nCOMPEL THE EXAMINATION OF A\nSTUDENT AT THE JRC BY AN EXPERT OF\nTHE COMMISSIONER'S CHOOSING.\nAfter the JRC Families presented evidence that the Commissioner's\ntermination of the specialized food program had caused serious injury to _'o JRC\nStudents, the Commissioner requested that the father of J. C., one of the injured\nstudents, consent to having J.C. examined by an expert chosen by the\nCommissioner. Tr. X:22. When J.C.'s father refused to consent to the\nexamination, the Commissioner moved to have the Trial Court compel consent to\nthe examination. Id. The Trial Court denied the Commissioner's motion. L.d.at 25-\n26. In his appeal, the Commissioner contends that the Trial Court's denial of his\nmotion ,,,,'as\"'seriously prejudicial\" and warrants vacating the relief ordered by the\nTrial Court) _ The Commissioner further contends that he was seriously prejudiced\nby the denial of his motion to strike evidence offered by the JRC Families) 4\nBecause the Commissioner was neither entitled to examine J. C., nor seriously\nprejudiced by the denial of his motions, his argument should be rejected by this\nCourt.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the Trial Court acted well within its\ndiscretion in refusing to compel the examination of J. C. What the Commissioner\nsought through his motion was not the introduction of rebuttal evidence, but the\nopportunity to develop rebuttal evidence by examining J. C. The decision whether\nto permit a psychiatric examination \"is addressed to the court's sound discretion and\ndepends upon a showing of good cause\". R.R.K v S.P.G.. 400 Mass. 12, 19\n(1987) (citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 35(a)). As this Court has observed, \"more than any\n_ Commissioner's Brief at 68.\n12\n\nother mode of discover),, an examination [under Mass.R.Civ.P. 35] impinges upon\nthe privacy and personality of the party being examined\". Id. (citations omitted).\nThe Commissioner's demand that J.C. be examined over the objections of her\nfather not only rides roughshod over her privacy rights, but also directly contradicts\nthe Commissioner's position with respect to psychiatric evaluations. In response to\nobjections raised by certain parents to the psychiatric evaluations required by the\nCommissioner in his February 9, 1994 letter, the Commissioner, through counsel,\nrepresented to the court-appointed mediator that \"the Department doe_., not intend to\ndo any psychiatric evaluations without the consent of the parents\". S. App. 5, lines\n6-11. The Trial Court's conclusion that the Commissioner had already subjected\nthe JRC Students to medical and psychiatric examinations that were \"'unnecessa_\"'\nand \"intrusive\" provides an ample basis for denyi:_g the Commissioner the\nopportunity to perpetrate further injury on J. C. F. 281, App. 1279.\nEven if, assuming _, that the Commissioner's motion had been\nmeritorious, the Commissioner's appeal fails to demonstrate that the denial of his\nmotion constituted prejudicial error. See Adoption of Paula, 420 Mass. 716, 734\n(1995) (stating that \"[t]he burden is on the appellant to demonstrate an abuse of 'a\nprejudicial error resulting from an abuse of discretion'\")(citations omitted). _ The\nevidence presented at trial showed that two Students, J. C. and W. M., had\nsuffered injury as the result of the termination of the specialized food program.\nHowever, contrary to the Commissioner's representation to this Court, he did not\nseek to compel examinations of both J. C. and W. M., he only sought to compel\n_ kl. at 67-68.\n_sThe doclrine of curative admissibility upon v.hich the Commissioner relies \"allov.s a part)\nharmed by incompetent evidence to rebut that evidence only,' if the original evidence tnealed\nsignificant prejudice\". Commonwealth v. Ruffin. 3q9 Mass. 811. 814 (19871 {emphasis\nsuppliedJ.\n13\n\nthe examination of J. C. _6 The Commissioner can hardly be prejudiced by the\ndenial of a motion that he did not make.\nSimilarly, although the Commissioner claims to have been seriously\nprejudiced by the Trial Court's refusal to strike the evidence concerning the injuries\nsuffered by W. M. and J. C., the Commissioner did not request that all of that\nevidence be stricken from the record. The evidence presented on this issue by the\nJRC Families took the form of testimony from Dr. Von Heyn and J.C.'s father.\nTr. IX: 96-97, and X:6-7. In addition, Dr. Israel testified that termination of the\nspecialized food program had injured W. M. and J. C. Tr.VIIB, 63-65. However,\nthe Commissioner moved only to strike the testimony of Dr. Von Heyn. r Thus,\neven if the Court had struck Dr. Von Heyn's testimony in response to the\nCommissioner's motion, the record would still support the conclusion that J. C.\nand W.M. had been injured by the termination of the specialized food program.\nAccordingly, even if the Trial Court erred in denying the Commissioner's motion to\nstrike the testimony of Dr. Von Heyn, the denial constituted harmless error \"'which\ndoes not affect the substantial rights of the parties\". Mass.R.Civ.Pro. 61.\n_\"T'heCommissioner misstates the record v,hen heclaims that he\"moved foran order requiring the\nguardians of both studentsto consent to having the students examined by the Commissioner's\nexpert\". Commissioner's Brief at 67. In fact,the Commissioner sought anorder \"'compelling J.C.\nto consent toan evaluation by a psychiatrist\". Tr.X: 22, lines 18-22.\n_rThe Commissioner also misstates the record when he claims that he moved to have _'the\nevidence previously presented by the parents on this issue [the specialized food program] b¢\nstricken ...\". Commissioner's Brief at67-68. In fact, the Commissioner only requested that \"'the\ntestimony of Dr. Von Heyn as to the effect of stopping the specialized food program be stricken\".\nTr.X:26. lines 4-7.\n14\n\n111. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN ITS\nASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE\nCOMMISSIONER'S CONDUCT ON THE JRC\nFAMILIES\nThe bankruptcy of the Commissioner's attempt to literally relitigate eveq,.\nsingle finding of fact entered by the Trial Court _sis demonstrated by his challenge\nto the Trial Court's conclusions: (1) that the Commissioner's communications\nwith the JRC Families were calculated to alarm the Families; and (2) that the JRC\nFamilies were injured as a result of the Commissioner's bad faith conduct, Even if\nthe findings of the Trial Court were not entitled to great deference, the record of\nthis proceeding manifestly demonstrates that the Commissioner has failed to\ndemonstrate that the Trial Court's findings were clearly erroneous.\nA. Under Rule 52(a_ Of The Massachusetts Rules\nof Civil Procedure.

Canb:, 2_that verbatim findings are to be subjected to \"the most intrusive appellate\nscrutiny .'\" The Commissioner's argument ignores the fact that \"numerous cases\nhave approved the practice of adoption by the trial judge of findings submitted by\ncounsel for the prevailing part)' and have held that such findings are entitled to the\nsame weight as they would receive if drafted by the judge himself.\" Louis D_'eyfus\n& (?ie v.

HBC Assocta es, z the appellant\ncontended, as does the Commissioner, that _ormier stands for the proposition that\nthe verbatim adoption of findings proposed by the prevailing party mandates\nabandonment of the customai 3' deference accorded the findings of the Trial Court.\nAnthony's Pier Four, 411 Mass. at 464-465. The Court repudiated this\ninterpretation of Cormier, stating that:\nIn Cormier, this court held that we would apply\n\"stricter scrutiny\" to findings of a judge \"'which fail\nto evidence 'a badge of personal analysis'\". At the\nsame time, however, we noted that \"the 'clearly\nerroneous' standard is not displaced. Thus, even in\nthe e,¢ent of verbatim adoption of a submission of\ncounsel, an appellate court +'carefully scrutinizes the\nrecord, but does not change the standard of review\".\nld. at 465 (citations omitted). Thus, even if the Trial Court had adopted the\nfindings of BRI verbatim, 24the clearly erroneous standard of review would still\napply.\nSimilarly, the Commissioner's suggestion that \"'because the evidence in this\ncase is largely documentau.., this Court is free to draw its own conclusions\nfrom the evidence \"z\" completely ignores the thirteen days of vigorously contested\ntestimony in this case. The circumstances that place an appellate court in as good a\nposition as the Court to decide on factual issues are not present in the instant case.\nCourts have limited \"'the more intrusive review\" urged by the Commissioner to\n:: Commissioner's Brief at 70-71.\n:_411 Mass. 451 (1991).\n'+ Contrary to the Commissioner's contention, the Trial Court neither adopted the proposed\nfindings of BRI ,¢erbatim norfailed to demonstrate a lack of independent judgment that warrants a\ncareful scrutiny of the record. Thus, the Commissioner's reliance upon Marl\" v. Back Bay\nArchitectural Commission. a case in which the trial judge plainly failed to exercise independent\njudgment in adopting verbatim findings proposed by prevailing parties is unwarranted. 23\nMass.App.Ct. 679, 680-681 (1987). Instead, the record demonstrates that the findings are the\nproduct of the Court's \"independent judgment\" and that the alleged deficiencies \"do not result from\njudicial error but. ratherare the product of [the Commissioner's]... disagreement with the judge's\nfindingsof fact. and [her] resulting interpretation of the agreements'+.

Moreover, notwithstanding the\nCommissioner's characterization of the proceedings below as documentar,, in\nnature, the Commissioner makes numerous requests that this Court reject findings\nmade by the Trial Court based upon oral testimony.:\" The fact that the Commission\nchallenges findings made by the Trial Court based upon oral testimony constitutes a\n\"compelling reason\" to apply the \"'clearly erroneous\" standard.

However, in direct contradiction to\nthe Commissioner's denial of even contemplating the abrupt cessation of JRC's\nauthority, the closure of JRC was not only contemplated, it ',,,'as an agenda item for\nthe September 7, 1993, meeting of the so-called \"Tuesday Morning Group\". The\nSeptember 7, 1993 Agenda, which includes plans to have the Attorney General's\noffice prepare a receivership petition in case of emergency and a requirement of 60\ndays advance notice before JRC closes, makes it clear \"that the Tuesday Morning\nGroup was targeting closure of JRC as early as September 7, 1993\". F.188, App.\n1254-1255.\nThe Commissioner included as enclosures to his September 3, 1993 letter\ncopies of his letters of August 6, and August 31, 1993 letters to Dr. Israel. v,'hich\nthe Trial Court found to be replete with false statements concerning the compliance\nof the JRC with behavior modification regulations, the status of JRC's application\nto use Level 111interventions, and the safety and efficacy of the treatments provided\nbvtheJRC. F. 63-67, 70-73. 99-101. 105-110; App. 1224, 1226-1228. 1233-\n1235. Contrau' to his stated intention of keeping the parents of the JRC students\nfully informed concerning the certification process, Commissioner Campbell failed\nto disclose in his September 3, 1993 letter the existence of the 1991 and 1993\nCertification Reports prepared by DMR staff that effectively refuted the contention\nthat the JRC '.,,'asnot in compliance with DMR regulations and that serious concerns\nexisted regarding the professional acceptability of the interventions in use at the\nJRC. Campbell, Tr. 111: 187-188. The only reference to the work of the\ncertification team contained in the August 31, 1993, letter inaccurately characterizes\nthe July, 1993 Report, to suggest problems within the GED-4 when, in fact, the\nReport states that \"the team is of the consensus that the present use of the GED-4\nant2 the specialized food program are being carded out within the mandate of the\n_\"Commissioner's Brief at 107.\n20\n\nregulations of the Department of Mental Retardation, and there is no reason to\nchange the previous recommendation that BR! retain its certification to employ\nLevel !il interventions in its behavior modification programs\". U-75 at 11.\nThe Commissioner's failure to provide the families of the JRC students with\naccurate information concerning the 1991 and 1993 Certification Repolts stands in\nsharp contrast with his willingness to include as an enclosure to his letter a copy of\na letter from Dr. Paul Jansen. At trial, the Commissioner testified that he did not\nprovide the 1993 Certification Report because \"there was a process for certification\nand that was a document that was part of that process and the process had not been\nconcluded\". Campbell, Tr. W: 188. However, the Commissioner acknowledged\nthat, even though he was concerned about the impact that the serious allegations of\nabuse contained in the Jansen letter might have on the families of the JRC students\n(Campbell, Tr. IV: 192), he circulated the letter to the families before the\nDepartment had completed its review of the JRC response to Dr. Jansen's letter and\ndid not provide the families with any of the materials provided by JRC in response\nto Dr. Jansen's allegations, ld. at 192-193. Moreover, despite the fact that the\nCommissioner testified at trial that it is not his usual practice to discuss allegations\nof abuse with third parties because they are no more than allegations (ld. at 188),\nthe Commissioner circulated the Jansen lette; without any explanation that the\nallegations had not been substantiated. Campbell, Tr. IV: 192-193.\nThe Commissioner's August 31 Certification letter further belied his\nassurances that no abrupt cessation of the JRC's certification was even\ncontemplated by including as a condition to the purported grant of interim\ncertification, a requirement that \"BRI will notify all funding sources that there must\nbe in place within sixty days an emergency plan for each resident to address the\nfunding and logistics of any unexpected medical, personal or programmatic\nsituations which BRI deems are beyond the capacity of BRi to address\".

Tr. IV: 196, U-109 at 3. _ Moreover,\n3_At trial, the Commissioner acknowledged that an allegation of abuse involving Dr. Israel\npersonally mightcause anxiety among family members of JRC students.

The\nCommissioner's claim that alarm that was felt by the JRC Families was caused by\nJRC 3-\"rather than by the Commissioner's inflammatory and inaccurate statements is\nentirely without record support. The record unequivocally demonstrates that the\nJRC Families were alarmed by the Commissioner's callous disregard for the truth\nand his blatant hostility to the JRC.\noccurred to him to inform the families that the allegations against Dr. Israel were found to be\nunsubstantiated, kl.\n3:Commissioner's Brief at 108.\n23\n\nC. The Trial Court's Conclusion That The .IRC\nFamilies Have Suffered Iniurv As A Result Of\nThe CoMmissioner's Contemptuous Conduct Is\nAmply Sunnorted By The Record.\nAlthough the Commissioner has aggressively portrayed himself as a\nprotector of the Student members of the Class, he is apparently indifferent to the\ninjury his conduct has caused to the Students and their Families. The\nCommissioner challenges _ the Trial Court's conclusion that \"JRC, the students,\nparents and families of the students have suffered egregious and irreparable harm as\na result of Commissioner Campbell's actions of contempt\". _ The Commissioner's\nargument posits an artificially limited definition of injur 3' to the JRC Students when\nhe contends that \"the only findings of concrete physical harm to individual students\nconcern the effects on two students of the cessation of the specialized food program\nin June of 1995\". 3-_ The Commissioner's argument not only misstates the record\nbelow, but it also demonstrates a disturbing indifference to the highly vulnerable\npopulation of Students whose welfare is his responsibility.\nThe record below documents a history of the sacrifice of the health, safety,\nand welfare of the JRC Students upon the altar of the preservation of the\nCommissioner's regulator3' prerogatives. The record below documents that the\nCommissioner and his staff pursued an \"'unrelenting stream of bad faith regulatory\ndemands\". F. 268, App. 1276. These demands included the requirement that JRC\nstaff conduct research related to the so-called \"Rivendell team\" which diverted staff\n3_Commissioner's Brief at 149-150.\nJudgment and Order, ¶ 2,App. 1340.\n_ Commissioner's Briefat 148. The fact that the Commissioner is willing to acknowledge that\nthe Trial Court made any finding of injury constitutesa remarkable concession. Later in his brief.\nthe Commissionel argues that \"there are no findingsthat this regulator),activity resulted in any\nseriou.sor pervasive harm tothe health or safety of BRI's clients\". Id. at 153 (emphasis supplied).\nWhile the Commissioner may not consider a finding that, as a result of his misconduct, there has\nbeen \"adramatic increase\" inthe health threatening behaviors of two students (F.298. App. 1284-\n1285) tobe a seriousmatter, the JRC Families beg to differ.\n24\n\ntime from the care of the Students (F.272-275, App. 1278), the diversion of the\ntime of Dr. Israel and staff psychologists from care of Students (F.276-280, App.\n1278-1279), and a requirement that the JRC Staff undergo a training program that\n\"did not provide the JRC Staff with anything new and useful beyond the job\ntraining already received at JRC\" (F.283-284, App. 1280). in an effort to show\nthat the JRC was not providing adequate care, the Students were subjected to\nmedical and psychiatric evaluations \"without an analysis or even a regard to\nwhether any of these were clinically indicted\". 36 F. 281, App. 1279.\nThe Commissioner's regulatory assault, and the financial losses suffered by\nthe JRC, had the effect of seriously compromising the ability of the JRC to provide\nthe services necessary to the health and well-being of the Students. The budget cuts\nand diversion of staff resources resulting from the Commissioner's regulator)'\nassault \"adversely affected the quality of the most important aspect of JRC's\nprogram -- the positive programming and educational components of the program\".\nF. 268, App. 1276-1277. Staff reductions and budget cuts have harmed the ability\nof the JRC to provide one-on-one training, the student reward program, and the\ncommunity education program. F. 29t-293, App. 1283. The staff reductions have\nnot only affected the number of staff, but also the quality of the JRC staff. The\nTrial Court found that one consequence of the Commissioner's contemptuous\nconduct was that the more marketable and qualified staff left the JRC for fear that it\nwould not survive. F. 294, App. 1283. 37 As a result, there is a \"less skillful and\nRather then demonstrating thatthere were any unmet medical needs or indications of abuse, these\nmedical examinations demonstrated \"unequivocally that that the students as a group are health)'.\nwell-nourished, receiving excellent care with no signs of abuse or mistreatment\". F. 282, n.9.\nApp. 1280.\n3_The Commissioner's simplistic assertion that staff reductions have not injured the students\n\"because if staff are laid off in proportion to the drop in enrollment, then the student to staff ratio\nshould remain approximately the same\" (Commissioner's Brief at 148) demonstrates a remarkable\nlack of concern for staff quality and the importance of continuity in the relationships between staff\nand students. See Peterson, Tr. IX 79-80 (lack of continuity in staff had a deleterious impact on\nhis son, a student at JRC).\n25\n\nqualitystaffavailabletorespondtoacrisis\"whichhashadtheeffectofplacing\"the\nJRCstudentsandstaffatrisk for more injuries due to low staffing\". F. 294, App.\n1283-1284.\nThe most striking illustration of the Commissioner's obvious lack of\nconcern for the welfare of the JRC Students is his decision to ban the specialized\nfood program, In a glaring parallel to the decision of the OFC to terminate\ntreatment at BRI without any medical justification F. 59, App. 101, the\nCommissioner terminated the specialized food program \"after his own team of\ndoctors had concluded that there were no adverse health effects from the\nprogram\". 3s F. 251, App. 1271.\nThe Commissioner attempts to justify his decision by claiming that the\nspecialized food program \"denies the client basic sustenance\" in violation of DMR\n• 19\nregulations- . The Commissioner's claim is directly contradicted by conclusions of\nhis 1993 Certification team, which found that ninety percent of the non-obese\nstudents who in the specialized food program had either gained weight or remained\nstable, that there were \"no adverse health consequences of the Specialized Food\nProgram\", and that the Specialized Food Program was being operated in a manner\nconsistent with DMR regulations. F.47-48, App. 1220-1221. Moreover, if the\nspecialized food program did, in fact, violate DMR regulations, one would hardly\nexpect that the Commissioner's chief deputy, Dr. Cerreto, to approve a treatment\nplan that included the specialized food program as the prototype for all treatment\nplans at JRC. Yet as part of the July 1994 agreement between DMR and the JRC,\nDr. Cerreto approved the plan of W.M., which included use of the specialized food\nprogram, as a prototype for JRC treatment plans. F. 235-239, App. 1268-69.\nThe Commissioner terminated JRC'sauthority toadminister the specialized foodprogram in his\nJanuary 20, 1995\"cetlification\" letter, which also terminated JRC's authority to administer three\nother procedures, programmed multiple applications, automatic negative reinforcement, and\nbehavior rehearsals with electrical skinstimulation.

F. 229-230, App. 1267-1268.\nThe Commissioner's decision to terminate the specialized food program was\nmade not only with a complete disregard for the available medical and psychiatric\nevidence, but also in direct violation of his obligations under the Settlement\nAgreement. If the Commissioner, in fact, had evidentiary support for his\ncontention that the specialized food program was having adverse effects upon\nindividual students, the Settlement Agreement mandates that the proper method for\nchanging the treatment plans of individual students was to seek a modification of\nthe Student's treatment plan in the Probate Court. _2 The Commissioner was aware\nof the terms of the Settlement Agreement and had previously represented to the Trial\n'01_.\n_ Commissioner's Brief at 142.\n27\n\nCourtthathewouldnot undertakeanyactionwhich \"interfereswith any court-\napprovedprogram\".

TheCommissionerwas alsoawarethat the\nspecializedfoodprogramhadbeenapprovedbytheTrialCourt.Tr.VI: 200-201.\nTheCommissioner'dsecisiontoterminatethespecializedfoodprogramhad\nadevastating impact upon two students in particular. The Trial Court found that\nthese _'o students suffered \"a dramatic increase in their health-dangerous\nbehaviors\" as a result of the termination of the specialized food program. F. 298,\nApp. 1284-1285. It is particularly tragic that one of those students, J. C., had\nregressed to a life-threatening state as a result of the OFC's termination of treatment\nin 1985. 4_ App. 82-83.\nIn his attempt to minimize the injuD' that his contemptuous conduct has\ninflicted upon these students, the Commissioner mischaracterizes the testimony of\nDr. Von Heyn and J.C.'s father. The Commissioner misquotes Dr. Von Heyn to\nsuggest that because restraints had been used with one student, W.M. in January of\n1995, Dr. Van Heyn's testimony that W.M.'s condition had deteriorated after\ncessation of the specialized food program was inaccurate? 4 However, the fact that\nW.M. had been in restraints in January of 1995 does not contradict Dr. Von Heyn's\ntestimony that W.M. had suffered an increase in crises of self-destructive behavior\nand that increase was caused by the termination of the specialized food program.\nTr. IX: 94, lines 10-24; 95, lines 1-4; 96, 10-19.\nSimilarly, the Commissioner argues that the fact that J.C. engaged in self-\ndestructive behaviors prior to the termination of the specialized food program\nsomehow invalidates the testimony of Dr. Von Heyn concerning the impact that the\ntermination of the specialized food program had on J,C.'s condition. However,\nneither Dr. Von Heyn nor J.C.'s father testified that J.C. had not engaged in self-\n'-_App. 121.\n=_Her father testified attrial that J.C. never fully recovered from have regressed asaresult of the\nOFC's termina'.iorJ of treatment. Tr. Vo|. X a_10.\n28\n\ndestructive behaviors prior to termination of the specialized food program. Their\ntestimony was that J.C.'s self-destructive behaviors increased as result of the\nspecialized food program. Thus, the testimony of Dr. Von Heyn and the father of\nJ.C. support the Trial Court's conclusion, which is entitled to great deference, that\nthe termination of the specialized food program had critical impact on W.M. and\nJ.C.\nThe fact that the Commissioner fails to acknowledge in his argument that his\nactions have injured the family members of the JRC Students is entircly consistent\nwith the lack of respect for the JRC Families exhibited by the Commissioner\nthroughout the certification process? _ Notwithstanding the Commissioner's failure\nto acknowledge the injury he has inflicted on the JRC Families. that injuD' is amply\ndocumented in the record of this proceeding.\nIn light of the importance of the JRC program to the JRC Families, it should\ncome as no surprise that the prospect that the Commissioner might succeed in his\nefforts to terminate the JRC program would be the source of considerable and\njustified anxiety. 4_ For some of the JRC Families, this was the second time the\nhealth and well-being of a family member was threatened by the bad faith actions of\nan agency of the Commonwealth. 4' As was recognized by Judge Rotenberg, it is\nthe Students and their families, not the agencies of the Commonwealth and their\nemployees who will bear the consequences of the termination of the JRC treatment\noption, F. 48, App. 96-97.\n\"Commissioner's Brief at 142.\n'_Although the Commissioner gives short shrift tothe interests of the JRC Families in his brief.\nhis communications with the JRC families are notable for the self.serving claims of concern for\nthe their interests.

As has\nbeen previously been discussed, the Commissioner's penchant for inflammatot),\nstatements and failure to be honest in his communications with the JRC Families\ninflicted injury on them. Peterson, Tr. Vol. IX: 65-67. The Commissioner's\nchoice of the Rivendell team to conduct an \"independent review\" of the JRC\nprogram and his decision to proceed over the objections of the JRC Families\nappears to nothing less than a calculated insult to the JRC Families. 4s it was\noffensive to the JRC Families that Students were subjected to intrusive and\nunnecessary examinations. 49 Perhaps most offensive is the fact the JRC Families\nhad to endure the deterioration of the JRC program and witness the effect that\ndeterioration has had on the Students.\nThe most quantifiable injury inflicted on the JRC Families is the expenditure\nrequired for attorneys fees. The Trial Court concluded that the JRC Families had\nincurred \"'legal fees and expenses in connection with DMR's certification process\nand in bringing this contempt action through August of 1995\" in the amount of\n$119,676.98.

THE RELIEF GRANTED BY THE TRIAL\nCOURT IS JUST AS A MATI'ER OF EQUITY\nAND PROPER AS A MATI'ER OF LAW.\nThe Commissioner contends that even if the Trial Court's contempt findings\nwere legally and factually sound, the relief order by the Trial Court is unwarranted\nand should be vacated by this Court. There is no question that the relief ordered by\nthe Trial Court, which includes appointment of a receiver to assume regulator)'\nauthority over DMR, an injunction against the Commissioner and his agents from\ntaking an)' action to frustrate the Receiver's in the performance of his duties and\nfrom attempting to do so through the individual guardianship proceedings, and an\naward of attorneys fees, 5_is extraordinary. However, the risk of injury 1o the JRC\nFamilies in the absence of the Trial Court's relief mandates rejection of the\nCommissioner's argument.\nA • In Issuing the Receivership Orders and\nInjunctive Relief. the Trial Court A¢ted\nProperly and Within its Discretion and\nAuthority.\nThe Commissioner, relying to a large extent on a remarkable comparison\nbetween the circumstances of this case, as found by the Trial Court, and the\ncircumstances that justified the appointment of a receiver in Perez v. Boston\nHousing Authority, s2argues that the Trial Court had no basis for appointment of a\nreceiver, s3 However, the comparison has the opposite of its intended effect,\n_l App. 1341-1342.\n_: 379 Mass. 703 (1980).\n_3In the Commissioner's brief, the Commissioner does not contend that the Trial Court lacks the\nauthority to appoint a receiver Rather, the Commissioner argues that the circumstances of this case\ndo not justify exercise of the \"extraordinary\" remedy of receivership. Commissioner's Brief at 150-\n154.\n31\n\nmakingacompellingdemonstration that appointment of a receiver is well within the\nTrial Court's authority and is necessary in this case to effectuate the Trial Court's\norder.\nAppointment of a receiver is warranted when there is \"a repeated or\ncontinuous failure of the officials to comply with a previously issued decree,\nreasonable forecast that the mere continued insistence by the Court that these\nofficials perform the Decree would lead only to 'confrontation and delay' a lack of\nleadership that could be expected to turn the situation around in a reasonable time\".\nPerez, 379 Mass. at 736 (citations omitted). Before the remedy of receivership is\nemployed other less drastic remedies should be explored, ld.\nAn application of these criteria to the findings of the Trial Court compel the\nconclusion that appointment of a receiver with broad powers is warranted. The\nTrial Court made repeated findings that the Commissioner and DMR staff violated\nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement. The fact that these violations included fraud\nupon the Court, intimidation and harassment of Court officials, violations of\nagreements made during the course of mediation, and perjury provides a reasoned\nbasis for forecasting that \"confrontation and delay\" would be the likely results if the\nTrial Court limited its remedy to merely insisting that the Commissioner comgly\nwith orders of the Trial Court. Moreover, based upon the findings of the Trial\nCourt, itcannot be said that there is leadership in DMR that would turn the situation\naround in a reasonable time. To the contrary, it is DMR's existing leadership that\nabrogated the Settlement Agreement and initiated the regulatory assault on the JRC.\nIf any conftrmation of the need for a receiver was necessary, the Commissioner's\nobjection to instruction to the receiver to eliminate \"anti-BRl bias\" at DMR provides\nit. s4 Finally, the findings of the Trial Court make it plain that appointment of a\nreceiver is a remedy of last resort. Neither the arbitration process established by the\nr4Commissioner's Briefat 155.\n32\n\nSettlemenAtgreemenntorthe mediation process imposed by the Trial Court have\nbeen successful in protecting the JRC and the JRC families from the bad faith of the\nCommissioner.\nThe Commissioner's contention that his conduct is less egregious than that\nof the Boston Housing Authority ss resolves any doubts in favor of appointing a\nreceiver. While the Court in Perez found \"incompetence\", \"indifference\", and\n\"gross mismanagement\" among the members of the Boston Housing Authority _6,\nthere were no findings \"that high ranking government officials have been\ndeliberately untruthful on the witness stand, have expended public funds in order to\npursue baseless allegations, have authorized unfounded ethical attacks, and\nlaunched investigations of Court personnel, [which] constitutes pervasive public\ncorrupt •on _7. Particularly, disturbing to the JRC Families is the Commissioner's\nassertion that \"there are no findings that [his] regulatory activity directly resulted in\nany serious or pervasive harm to the health or safety of BRI's che\"nts. \" s_ The\nCommissioner's inability to distinguish between intentional wrongdoing and\nincompetence and his blantant disregard for the injury that he has inflicted on the\nJRC Families make a compelling case for appointment of a receiver to assume the\nCommissioner's responsibility to regulate the JRC in order to secure the benefits of\nthe Settlement Agreement f_r the JRC Families•\nThe Commissioner Has Failed To Demonstrate\nBD\nThat He 13 Entitled To A Stay Of The Relief\nGranted Bv The Trial Court.\nHaving been denied a stay pending appeal at every turn, the Commissioner\nrenews his request for a stay, 59 essentially advancing the same arguments\ns_,Commissioner's Brief at 152-153.\n_6Perez,379 Mass. at 725.\ns7Conclusions of Law ¶52.

Staying the relief ordered by the Trial Court\nwould expose the vulnerable JRC Students to punitive and retaliatory actions by the\nCommissioner. As is discussed previously the record below amply documents the\ninjury inflicted upon the JRC Families by the Commissioner and his agents. The\nfact that the Commissioner refuses to acknowledge the injurious consequences of\nhis actions conclusively demonstrates that the Commissioner will not be constrained\nby the risk of further injury to the JRC Families from continuing his regulatory\nassault on the JRC. As the Commissioner has provided no basis for concluding\nthat the Trial Court erred in concluding that \"[i]f a stay were granted, there is every\nindication that DMR will continue its effort to shut down JRC, leaving a most\nvulnerable population of students untreated\" (App. 1437), he has failed to\ndemonstrate that no substantial harm will come to the JRC Families. Accordingly,\nhis motion must be denied.\n6oInordertob¢entitled to a stay, the Commissioner must demonstrate must make\"(1) a strong\nshowing that he islikely tosucceed onthe merits of anappeal; (2) a strong showing that unless a\nstay is granted he will suffer irreparable injury; (3) a showing that no substantial harm is ,,,.'ill\ncome to other interested parties; and (4) a showing that a stay will do no harm to the public\ninterest\".

Fontaine v. Ebtec Corp., 415 Mass.309, 324 (1993). q\"ne\nTrial Court concluded that the JRC Families incurred \"legal fees and expenses in\nconnection with DMR's certification process and in bringing this contempt action\nthrough August 1995\" in the amount of $119,676.98 and ordered the\nCommissioner to pay that amount. App. 1314-1315. In making its award, the\nTrial Court concluded that:\nThe amount sought be the Parties as reimbursement for the\nattorneys' fees they have been forced to expend as a result of\nthe defendant's conduct over the last two years is fair and\nreasonable. The Court makes this finding, incorporating the\nAffidavits of the above mentioned parties [including the JRC\nFamilies] based upon the attorneys' years at the bar,\nstanding at the legal community, the caliber of their work in\nthe case, the difficulty of the matter, and the fact that there\nwas a minimal duplication of effort. 6s\nApp. 1314-1315.\nThe Commissioner contends that this award constituted an abuse of\ndiscretion34 The Commissioner's challenge to the award of attorneys fees not only\nmisstates the law and the record, but is also self-contradictory. The Commissioner\n6:Commissioner's Briefat 165.\n_'_Although the Commissioner contends thatthe Trial Court's finding is inadequate basis for an\naward of attorneys fees(Commi_ioner's Briefat 166), the Trial Court's finding in support of the\naward ofattorneys fees isremarkably similar to the finding upheldby the Court inHandy v, penal\nInstitutions Commissioner of Boston. 412 Mass. 759. 766.767 (1992).\n,4Commissioner's Brief at 173-175.\n36\n\nfails to meethis burdenof showingthattheTrial Court's awardwas clearly\nerroneouss,eeKeppeOy v. i_emaedy, 400 Mass. 199, 203 (1994), and this Court\nshould therefore affirm the award.\nThe fundamental contention underlying the Commissioner's argument is his\nassessment that counsel to the JRC Families 65(as well as counsel for the Student\nmembers of the Class) played a \"very limited role \"66 in the proceedings below. To\nsupport his argument, the Commissioner claims that the Trial Court's award of\nattorney's fees was solely for trial preparation, conduct of the trial and preparation\nof post-record documents. 67 The Commissioner's statement is directly contradicted\nby the record. The Trial Court's award was based upon its conclusion that for a\nperiod of two years the Commissioner conducted the certification process in bad\nfaith and that the expenditure of attorneys fees was necessary to protect the interests\nof the JRC Families. App. 1314. As is documented in the Affidavit In Support Of\nAttorneys Fees, these efforts included attendance at numerous motions,\nparticipation in the mediation sessions conducted by Judge Hurd, negotiations with\nDMR concerning implementation of the May 1994 agreement, and two arguments\nbefore a Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. App. 1178. Se_.ealso App.\n1150-1151. The Commissioner fails to articulate why these efforts to vindicate the\ninterests of the JRC Families, undertaken at a time when the Commissioner had\n\"authorized an inordinate and unusual amount of legal resources to be devoted to\nthe pursuit of JRC\" (App. 1315), should not be compensated.\n*_'he Commissioner also professes confusion as to the representation of the Class.\nCommissioner's Brief at 173, n.241. The Commissioner, however, was notsoconfused earlierin\nhis Briefwhen he acknowledged that \"first Kenneth Kurnos and then Eugene Curry had succeeded\nMr. Sherman ascounsel for thecertified 'ch_.s of all students,their parents and guardians'\", ld. at\n4, n.6.\nCommissioner's Brief at 175.\n_'_The Commissioner claims that the Court awarded fees to the counsel for the JRC Families and\nfor the Student Members ofthe Class \"for more than 1,000hours, largely spent sitting silentl_ at\ncounsel table or atdepositions ordrafting documents that added little or nothing to of substance to\nthose submitted by BRI\". Commissioner's Brief at 175.\n37\n\nThe Commissioner's criticism of the role played by counsel to the JRC\nFamilies during trial preparation and the trial itself consists of broad and\nunsupported assertions that provide no basis for concluding that the Trial Court\nerred. See I_ell v. United Princeton Properties, Inc., 884 F.2d 713, 721 (3rd Cir.\n1989) (stating that \"we emphasize that the adverse parties submissions cannot\nmerely allege that the time spent was excessive\"). The Commissioner's contention\nthat the witnesses presented by the JRC Families added little to the proceeding\nignores the fact that the testimony of these witnesses directly addressed injury\nsuffered by Students at the JRC. 6_ The lack of importance that the Commissioner\nattaches to this evidence in his argument on attomeys fees is contradicted by his\nearlier argument that the Trial Court's reliance on this evidence is highly\nprejudicial. 6°\nSimilarly, aside from his own unsupported assertions, the Commissioner\noffers no basis for challenging the Trial Court's conclusion that \"there was minimal\nduplication of the record\". App. 1341. A careful examination of the record\nTM\nshows that in their trial preparation•, \"71 presentation of evidence, 7: cross-\nexamination, and post-trial documents, counsel for the JRC Families raised issues\nSee, ._1_., Testimony of Dr. Von Heyn, Tr.IX:96.\n6,Commissioner's Brief at 67-68.\nThe Trial Court's findings regarding lack of duplication of effort make the Commissioner's\nreliance upon l)gnnell v. United States, 682 F.2d 240 (D.C. Cir. 1982), misplaced.\nCommissioner's Brief at 175. In Donnell, the Court stated that \"a special circumstance that\ncreates \"an exemption to the ordinary presumption in favor of granting attorneys fees to a\nprevailing party is 'where, although the plaintiffs received the benefits sought in the lawsuit, their\nefforts did not contribute to achieving those results'\", ld. at 247 (citations omitted).\n_ Counsel for the JRC Families atlended the depositions of the Parents of three Students at the\nJRC and Commissioner Campbell.

App. 7.\n72The Commissioner inaccurately states that the witnesses called by the JRC Families were on the\nBRI witness list. Commissioner's Brief at 175. In fact, in the interests of avoiding duplication.\nthe JRC Families and JRC submitted ajoint list of witnesses. App. 434.\n38\n\nofparticulacroncerntothe JRC Families. 7_ It is plain that the evidence presented\nby counsel to the JRC Families was of value to the Trial Court, which stated that\nthe testimony of the parents who testified at trial \"was credible and compelling.\nThere was dignity in each parent's demeanor. Their testimony spoke eloquently to\nthe best interest of their children, and thus stood in sharp contrast to the testimony\nelicited from the Department\". App. 1237, n. 27.\nTM\nThe Trial Court's award of attorneys fees ntanifestly demonstrates the\nexercise of the \"billing judgment\" required to sustain an award. As this Court has\nstated, \"in determining reasonable time expenditure, the judge should begin with the\ntime documented by the attorney, and consider whether itwas reasonable in light of\nthe difficult)' of the case and the results obtained\". Stratus, su_gp._, 387 Mass. at\n323 (citations omitted). The record documents that the Trial Court followed the\nCourt's instruction. In making the award, the Trial Court reviewed the affidavits\nsubmitted by counsel for the JRC Families as well as contemporaneous time\nrecords, including unredacted bills of counsel to the JRC Families. App. 1341.\nCounsel for the JRC Families devoted 754.2 hours to Ibis matter during the period\n\" For example, the cross-examination of the Commissioner focused principally on his lack of\nhonesty inhis communications with theJRC Families.

First. itis legally inaccurate. The Class Of All Students, Their Parents and Guardians\nwere named as Plaintiffinthe complaintthat initiated this proceeding. App. 284. See Mass. R.\nCir. Pro. 10(stating that *'Inthe complaint, the title of thecaption shall include the names of all\nparties ...\".). Moreover, since even the Commissioner concedes that the JRC Families have an\ninterest in the outcome of the certificationprocess (Tr.IV:182), it would be difficult for the\nCommissioner to contend that the JRC Families do not have a sufficient interest in this\nproceedingtowarrant their participation asplaintiffs. S¢€ 3 Smith Zobel, I_ples Practice § 143.\np.175 (*'Astothe natureoftheinterest sufficient toenable apersonto be a party,the general rule\nis applicable that the persons must have an interest affecting his liberty, tights or property.).\nSecond, even if the JRC Families were notparties, the contribution that they made to proceeding\nwarrants anawardof atlorneys fees.

The fact that the\nTrial Court chose to award fees for substantially all of the time that was required to\nrepresent the interests of the JRC Families (App. 1321) does not, in and of itself,\nsupport the Commissioner's contention that the Trial Court failed to carefully\nscrutinize the billing records submitted. As a preliminary matter, the Trial Court did\nnot award the full hourly rate charged by counsel to the JRC Families. 76 More\nimportantly, the Trial Court was entitled to consider the difficulty of the case, and\nthe results achieved, which support the Court's award of attorney's fees. See\nStratos, su.p._, 387 Mass. at 322; see also _, su_._0.L_4,9 F.3d at 944 (\"The\nreality is that both liability and remedy were contested and that the district court did\ngrant substantial relief to the plaintiffs\".).\nC. The Trial Court's In Camera Review Of\nContemvoraneous Time Records Of Counsel To\nThe .IRC Families Was Not An Error.\nThe Commissioner's contention that the affidavits submitted by counsel and\nthe in camera review of the contemporaneous time records does not constitute an\nadequate basis for an award of attorneys' fees is without merit. It must be\nrecognized that an award of attorneys fees could have been made upon the basis of\nthe affidavits submitted by counsel to the JRC Families. The affidavits submitted\nby counsel to the JRC Families were based upon contemporaneous time records\nand provided the hourly rates of counsel and the total number of hours devoted by\neach attorney to defending the JRC Families against the Commissioner's bad faith\n_\"Theamountof time spent by counsel to the JRC Families is not excessive when compared to\nawardscited by the Commissionerto support his argumentthat the hours spent wereexcessive.\nSe¢, ' v \" 749 F. 2d 945, 954 (l'st Cir. 1984) (\"Spending308 hours for a\nclaimed $84,700 toproduceaseventeen page motion to affirm, a thirty.seven page response brief\nand a two page supplemental abslract and to prepare for oral argument would appear to be\nunreasonable foralmost any case.\"); Society of Jesus. _QI__,411 Mass. at 760 (stating that \"We\nfindunreasonable fourhundred fifty hours spent producing twenty pages\").\n40\n\nconduct.

Thus, the affidavits provided by\ncounsel to the JRC Families constituted an adequate basis for the Trial Court's\naward of attorneys' fees and expenses.\nInstead of limiting its inquiry to the affidavits submitted by counsel, the\nTrial Court decided to review the contemporaneous time records of counsel and\ndetermined that in camera review was necessary in order to preserve attorney client\nprivilege. App. 1201. The Trial Court's in camera review constituted a proper\nmeans of determining whether the attorneys fees claimed were reasonable while\npreserving the attorney client privilege. See.

The\nCommissioner's attempt to extract from Stastny v. Southern Bell Tel. and Tel.'\"\nand Blowers v. Lawyers Co-Op Publishing Co. TM a broad rule that information\ncontained in an attorneys fee application is not privileged is not supported by a\nTM\ncarefully reading of those cases law.

Stastn_, su_gp_._,at 663; _ su_gp.L_at\n76Although counsel to the JRC Families charged $160.00 per hour for the services of Eugene\nCurry, which represented adiscount from the customary hourly rate of $175.00, [App. I179]. the\nTrial Court made its award based uponanhourly rate of $150.00 per hour.\n7, 77 F.R.D. 662 (W.D.N.C. 1978).\n7g526 F.Supp. 1324 (W.D.N.Y. 1981).\nCommissioner's Brief at 171.\n41\n\n1326. so In the instant case, the Commissioner has already been provided with this\ninformation and is not prejudiced by the withholding of other, privileged\ninformation that is contained in the contemporaneous time records. _\nVI. THE ORDER OF THE APPEALS COURT\nSINGLE JUSTICE IMPLEMENTING THE\nCOMMISSIONER'S BAD FAITH DECISION\nTO TERMINATE TREATMENT OPTIONS\nSHOULD BE VACATED\nSJC-07045 is an appeal of an order of a Single Justice of the Appellate\nCourt which grants the relief sought by counsel (hereinafter referred to as \"the\nGuardianship Counsel\") representing fifty-one residents of the JRC in substituted\njudgment and guardianship proceedings of the denial of their Emergency Motion\nFor Order Directing JRC To Stop Using Certain Level 111Aversives, JRC S. App.\n135. _: By his order, the Single Justice has implemented the provisions of the\nCommissioner's January 20, 1995, letter which ordered the JRC to stop using four\naversive treatment methods, including the specialized food program. U-166,12-13.\nThus, the order of the Single Justice implements a decision of the Commissioner\nthat was undertaken in bad faith and which has caused and continues to cause injury\nto Students at the JRC.\n_' Infact, in Blower. the Court observedthat the claim of privilege was \"not with much \",igor\".\nU. at 1326, n.4.\n8_The Commissioner's reliance upon the Uniform Rules of Impoundment as a basis for his\nargument fordenial of anaward of attorneys' fees is misplaced. Notwithstanding the adoption of\nthe Uniform Rules. courts inMassachusetts haveretainedthe power to impound its files in acase\nand to deny public inspection of them when justice requires. See, w\nInc. v. Clerk Ma_aistrat¢of the Ware Division of the District Court. 403 Mass. 628, 632 (1988),\n(upholding a sua sponte impoundment order after adoption of the Uniform Rules stating \"[i]t is\nwithin the discretion of a court to impound its files in a case and to deny public inspection of\nthem, andthat isoflendonewhen justice sorequires\".) In considering an impoundment order,the\nCourt must balance the parties' privacy concerns against\"the general principle of publicity\" and\n\"must determine whether goodcause toorder impoundment exists and must tailor the scope of the\nimpoundment ord¢_so that it does not exceed the needfor impoundment.\" Id. at 632 (citations\nomitted).\n42\n\nAn examination of the proceedings below compels the conclusion that the\nSingle Justice's order exceeds the limited authority to review orders entered by the\nTrial Court. The Single Justice had only a limited authority to review the Trial\nCourt's order. The standard for review of the denial for a request for injunctive\nrelief iswhether the Trial Court \"abused its discretion. An appellate court role is to\ndecide whether the [trial] court applied proper legal standards and whether there\nwas reasonable support for its evaluation of factual questions ...\". Commonw¢_llh\nv. Mass. CRINC, 392 Mass. 79, 86-87 (1984). When the Guardianship Counsel\nmoved for their mandatory order, they had the moving party's burden to \"show\nthat, without the requested relief, it may suffer a loss of rights that cannot be\nvindicated should it prevail on the merits\". Packaging Ir_dustries Group, Inc. v.\n.Cllgg._, 380 Mass. 609, 616 (1980).\nBecause the Guardianship Counsel failed to meet their burden, the Trial\nCourt acted properly in denying their motion. Neither the Guardianship Counsel\nnor DMR have the authority to simply order wholesale changes in treatment plans\nof the JRC students. To the degree that there are legitimate changes required to the\ntreatment plan of any student, the Guardianship Counsel remain free to seek those\nchanges in the context of the individual substituted judgment proceedings and are\nrequired, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement to do so.\nThe Single Justice's wholesale amendment of fifty-one treatment plans\nviolates well-settled principles of Massachusetts law that hold that treatment plans\nfor incompetent individuals must be tailored to the unique needs of each person.\nSee, In The Matter Of Moe, 385 Mass. 555, 432 N.E. 2d 712, 720. As is\nrecognized by Trial Court's order, this is accomplished in substituted judgment\nproceedings in which a judge makes treatment decisions for mentally ill or mentally\nIn orderto avoid unnecessary duplication, the motion, which is part of the Supplemental\nAppendix submittedby JRC, will not reproducedas part of this brief.

The Department is willing to continue\n12 and is obligated to continue to fund those.\n13 However, with Dr. Daignau!t's\n14 endorsement the Department intends to seek\n15 rein%bursement from the funding agencies for the cost .-.\n16 of those evaluations and those evaluations only\n17 THE COURT: I wonder if Dr.\n18 Daignault's endorsement means anything anymore? I\n19 suppose he did it while he was still in good odor\n2O with everyone.\n21 Anyway, it's a matter of record. Go\n22 ahead.\n23 MR. CURRY: To finish, it is my -- I\n24 just wanted to state a couple ot things for the\n25 record.\n\n1 It is my view that the Judge %\n2\nRotenberg Center has complied with its obligation\n3 under Condition 6.\n4 It was obligated to send out letters\n5 to the parents. It sent those letters out. The\n6 letters were received.\n7 There are parents that have profound\n8 objections to these evaluations. And I want to be\nabsolutely clear in case anybody has any doubts\nl0 about this, that these doubts come from the parents.\nii They are not being manipulated by anybody at _h.e\n12 JRC.\n13 The JRC has done what it needed _o\n14 do. It sent out a follow up letter urging the\n15 parents to consent.\n16 But this is an issue that is a hot\n17 button here, and I don't blame them, and I don't\n18 think its one that's going to go away easily.\n19 The process is ongoing. I got a\n2O letter late Friday afternoon from one of the parents\n21 raising three questions that I intend to discuss\n22 with Margaret at some point.\n23 They may turn around to con_enZ. $o\n24 it's a relatively small group who was refused at\n25 this point.\n\n59\n1 And I frankly don't see that if --\n2 that that issue should be barred to the\n3 certification of the Judge Rotenberg Center.\n4 That's all I have to say at this\n5 point.\n6 MS. YOGMAN: On that point, Your\n7 Honor, the Department does not intend to do any\n8 psychiatric evaluations without the consen_ of the\n9 parents. The correspondence concerns what BRI might\nI0 or might not do to obtain the consent or an order of\nll the Court to have the evaluations without consent.\n12 But the Department did not intend to\n13 force BRI to do any of these things, and certainly\n14 not to have the -- force the clients to undergo the\nIS evaluation without the parent or guardians' consent.\n°D\n16 And with respect to the holding this\n17 against BRI, what the Department -- the only way\n18 that this might indirectly effect the Department's\n19 ability to evaluate BRI is that this is that much\n2O less information that the Department has available.\n21 It's not BRI fault that this\n22 information is not available but, nevertheless, the\n23 Department will have to make a decision about the\n24 psychiatric status of the population of BRI without\n25 the benefit of these additional evaluations.

Biscardi, both as \n  1 \n \n\n \n \n  representatives of the class of all patients at the Behavior Research Institute, Inc., their parents, and guardians. \n \n2  General Laws c. 231, § 118, first par., provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “A party aggrieved by an interlocutory order of a trial \ncourt justice ... may file, within thirty days of the entry of such order, a petition in the appropriate appellate court seeking relief \n \nfrom such order. A single justice of the appellate court may, in his discretion, grant the same relief as an appellate court is \nauthorized to grant pending an appeal under section one hundred and seventeen.” \n \n3  The commissioner also appealed from the preliminary injunction to a full panel of the Appeals Court pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § \n118, second par. See Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. v. Commissioner of the Dep’t of Mental Retardation (No. 2), 424 Mass. 471, \n \n677 N.E.2d 153 (1997). \n \n4  On June 12, 1995, the single justice entered an order to clarify the May 11, 1995, order, which provided as follows: “It is ordered \nthat the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center is enjoined from using the following Level III aversives, pending a further order of \n \nthis Court or a Single Justice thereof: automatic negative reinforcement with electric shock, programmed multiple application of \nelectric shock, the specialized food program, and behavior rehearsal lessons using Level III interventions.” \n \n5  Guardianship counsel consist of nine attorneys who represent individual patients in substituted judgment and guardianship cases. \n \n \n6  Contrary to guardianship counsel’s argument, we do not consider this appeal frivolous and thus decline to award attorney’s fees. \nSee Commonwealth v. One 1987 Ford Econoline Van, 413 Mass. 407, 415 n. 10, 597 N.E.2d 430 (1992). \n \n \n7  Pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 118, first par., the single justice modified the preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction, \nhowever, was vacated when the judge entered the final decree. See Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. v. Commissioner of Dep’t of \n \nMental Retardation (No. 2), supra at 472, 677 N.E.2d 153. Therefore, we need take no action on the single justice’s order because \nthe preliminary injunction did not survive the entry of the final decree. Mahony v.

After  more  than  a  year  of  review  by  the \nDMH/DMR  licensing  division,  a  decision  on  BRI's  application  for \nlicensure  is  imminent. \nDMR  is  now  encountering  practical  obstacles  to  continuing  its \nClinical  involvement  in  each  and  every  case,  as  two  of  the  three \nDMR  clinicians  are  unable  to  continue  in  that  role.  However,  DMR \nstands  ready  to  provide  clinical  advice  to  the  Court  in  any  case \nor  on  any  issue  the  Court  may  request. \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  DMH  respectfully  requests  that  its \nmotion  be  allowed. \nThe  Department  of  Mental  Retardation, \nBy  its  attorney, \n   \nAnna  H. /Doherty \nDirector  of  Litigation \n160  North  Washingtcn  Street \nBoston,  MA  02114 \n(617)  727-8611 \nDated  October24,  1988 \nadkc.21\n",

Rather than repeat the arguments contained in the\nCommissioner's opening brief, which arc, instead, liberally cross-referenced\nherein, _this reply brief focuses on pointing out the many misstatements of\n_Thefollowing abbreviations are used herein to refer to the parties' briefs\nand supplemental appendices: \"DMR Br.\" (Commissioner's opening brief in SJC-\n(continued...)\n\nlaw andfact containedin BRI's briefz that were not anticipated in the\nCommissioner's opening brief.\nARGUMENT\nBRI _|iSSTATES Tile LEGAL STANDARDS GOVERNING THE\nlo\nCONSTRUCTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF CONSENT DECREES\nAGAINST STATE OFFICIALS.\nal BRI Misstates the Scope of Appellate Review of the Trial\nCourt's Contempt Findings.\nBRI appears to assume that the scope of appellate review of the trial\ncourt's contempt findings is the relatively deferential abuse of discretion\nstandard) That assumption is incorrect. This Court reviews contempt\n_(...continued)\n07101, his appeal from the contempt judgment), \"DMR PI Br.\" (Commissioner's\nopening brief in SJC-06956, his appeal from the preliminary injunction), \" Pl\nApp.\" (appendix in SJC-06956), \"BRI Br.\" (BRI's brief), \"Parents' Br.\" (brief of\nthe class of BRI students and parents), \"Students' Br.\" (brief of the student\nmembers of the class), \"BRI Supp. App.\" (BRI's supplemental appendix), \"Parents'\nSupp. App.\" (supplemental appendix of the class of BRI students and parents),\n\"DMR Supp. App.\" (Commissioner's supplemental appendix in SJC-07045).\n:Because, in most instances, the arguments made by the class of students\nand parents and the student members of the class are essentially the same as those\nmade by BRI, this brief uses \"BRI\" to refer generally to all appellees, unless\notherwise specified.\n3Atsome points in its brief, BRI appears to premise itscontempt arguments\non the deferential abuse of discretion standard, e.g., BRI Br. at 62 (\"There was no\nabuse of discretion by the Trial Court .... \"), 66 (\"This Court Should Afford Great\nDeference to the Trial Court's Construction And Enforcement of the Settlement\nAgreement.\"). At other points, however, BRI appears to acknowledge that the\nplenary errorof law standardof appellate review applies. E.g., BRI Br. at 58(\"The\nTrial Court's construction of the Settlement Agreement and enforcement through\nthe contempt sanction against the Commissioner of Mental Retardation were correct\n(continued...)\n-2-\n\njudgmentsundertheplenaryerror-of-lawstandards,ee, e.g., Warren Gardens\nHousing Coop. v. Clark, 420 Mass. 699, 701 (1995) (reversing contempt\njudgment where, \"[a]s a matter of law, clear and undoubted disobedience of\na clear and unequivocal order has not been established\"; emphasis added);\nand the federal cases cited by BRI on this point also counsel in favor of\nplenary review by this Court of the trialcourt's contempt findings. InAMF,\nh_c. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096 (Ist Cir. 1983), the court held that, regardless\nof how the standard of appellate review is characterized, \"the lower court's\nconstruction of the meaning of language in a consent decree is subject to\ncloser scrutiny than is likely appropriate as to ordinary factual questions.\" ld.\nat 1100-01.\nParticularly where the case involves \"the interpretation of defendant's\nactivities in light of the meaning and purpose of the decree,\" as this one does,\n\"courts of appeal have considerable freedom to review the [trial] court's\ndetermination of such matters.\" Id.; see also United States v. Bd. of Educ.,\n717 F.2d 378, 382 (7th Cir. 1983) (\"Bd. of Educ. /\") (\"interpretation of\nconsent decree provisions.., is a matter of law and subject to plenary review\non appeal\"). In a more recent case, also cited by BRI, Navarro-Ayala v.\nHernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325 (Ist Cir. 1991), the Court of Appeals for\nthe First Circuit distinguished several earlier eases relied upon by\nBRI--UnitedStates v. Massachusetts, 890 F.2d 507 (lst Cir. 1989); Mass.\nAss 'nof Older Ares. v. Comm 'r of Pub. Welfare, 803 F.2d 35 (lst Cir. 1986);\nLangton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (lst Cir. 1991)--and held that plenary\nappellate review, with no deference to the trial court's judgment, is\nappropriate where the issue \"involves determining the scope of the parties'\noriginal bargain.\" Nm'arro-Ayala at 1339-40. As explained by the Court of\n3(...continued)\nas a matter of law.\"), 62 (Heading IA, to the same effect).\n-3-\n\nAppealsin that case, \"If this were not so, the making of a consent decree\nwould, from the government's point of view, be a game of Russian roulette,\nsince there could be no predicting the circumstances which might lead the\njudge, a decade or so later, to enlarge the areas of his own control.\" ld. at\n1339.\nEven less deference isdue to the trial court's contempt rulings, where,\nas in this case, the trial court judge whose rulings axe being reviewed was not\ninvolved in the parties' negotiations that resulted in the consent decree that\nis now being interpreted and enforced, ld. at 1339 n.l 7; cf. United States v.\nBd of Educ., 717 F.2d at 382 (deference due to trial judge who approved the\ndecree). Furthermore, as recognized by the First Circuit in reversing\ncontempt rulings made by the trial court in another public law case, appellate\nreview of a finding of contempt is appropriately even more searching than\nreview of a finding of no contempt, because \"[t]he contempt power is... one\nof the most potent weapons in the judicial armamentarium.\" Project BASIC\nv. Kemp, 947 F.2d 11, 16 (lst Cir. 1991).\nB. Bill's Argument that Public Officials A re Required, Under\nPenalties of Contempt, to Comply Not Only with the Literal\nLanguage of a Consent Decree, but with Its \"Spirit,\" Stands\nthe Doctrine of Substantial Compliance on Its tleaa_\nBRI's remarkable contention that a public official may be subjected\nto contempt sanctions if his conduct, although not clearly in violation of the\nliteral terms of a consent decree, fails to comply with its \"spirit,\" BRI Brief\nat 58, 63-64, 4 turns the doctrine of substantial compliance on its head. That\n'BRI summarizes itsposition on this issue as follows: \"[T]he standard for\nfinding contempt of the Settlement Agreement as a public law consent decree is\nmore flexible, and enforcement through contempt isproper since the Commissioner\nviolated the objectives ofthe Settlement Agreement\" (emphasis added). BRI Br.\nat58. Similarly, in the body of its argument BRI contends, \"IT]he touchstone of\ncontempt of a public law consent decre€ is a violation of the intent, spirit and\nobjectives of the decree, not a violation of the strict terms of the order\" (emphasis\n(continued...)\n=4-\n\ndoctrine, as articulated and applied in the cases cited by BRI, calls for a more\nflexible, i.e., more lenient, standard in enforcing consent decrees against\npublic officials. Rather than require strict compliance by public officials,\nboth federal and state courts refrain from holding public officials in contempt,\neven where the)' clearly fail to comply with the literal terms of a decree, as\nlong as they \"substantially comply,\"---a lower, not a higher, standard. E.g.,\nLangton, 928 F.2d at 1222 (upholding finding of no contempt, although\n\"quite plain.., that there was n[ot] letter-perfect compliance with.., the\ndemands of the consent decrees\"); _United States v. Massachusetts, 890 F.2d\nat 510 (upholding finding of no contempt, despite Commonwealth's\nnoncompliance v,ith staffing ratios required by consent decree ); Palmigiano\nv. DiPrete, 700 F. Supp. 1180, 1191-92 (D.R.I. 1988) (stating that court\nwould not entertain contempt petition where prison population exceeded\ndecreed cap by only several persons for short time, but upholding finding of\ncontempt where defendants had far exceeded cap for several years); Town of\nManchester v. DEQE, 381 Mass. 208, 209 n.2, 212-13 (1980) (upholding\nfinding of contempt where town had not substantially complied with\nrequirements of consent decree).\nAs recognized in the cases cited by BRI, the \"safe harbor\" from\ncontempt sanctions afforded to public officials by the substantial compliance\ndoctrine, Palmigiano, 700 F. Supp. at 1191, is warranted in order to avoid the\n\"societal disruptions\" that might otherwise result from strict enforcement of\nsuch decrees against public officials, AMF, 711 F.2d at I101, and to\n%..continued)\nadded). Id. at63-64.\nSBRl's paraphrase of this holding.---_'conlempt upheld despite record\nindicating not 'letter-perfect compliance' with consent decree,\" BR1 Br. at\n64--directly misstates the holding and typifies BILl's perversion of the doctrine of\nsubstantial compliance.\n-5-\n\naccommodate\"the differing competencies of different branches of\ngovernment. ''6 Mass. Assoc. of Retarded Citizens, hw. v. King, 668 F.2d\n602, 607-08 (lst Cir. 1981). Thus, BRI's contention that the trial court\nappropriately imposed contempt sanctions against the Commissioner for\nviolating the \"spirit\" if not the letter of the Settlement Agreement is directly\nat odds v,ith the substantial compliance doctrine, which contes into play only\nwhere a public official clearly has failed to comply with the literal terms of\na decree and, even then, serves as a defense to, not a justification for, the\nimposition ofcontempt sanctions on a public official.\nC. BRI's Arguments Erroneously Assume that Contempt\nSanctions May Be Imposed on o Public Official for\nViolation of an Ambiguous Consent Decree.\nBecause this is a contempt case---in which it is axiomatic that a party\ncannot be sanctioned for violating an ambiguous order, see DMR Br. at 37-\n38; see also Bird v. Capital Site Management Co..423 Mass. 172, 178 (1996),\nquoting Peggy Lawton Kitchens, Inc. v. tlogan, 403 glass. 732, 734 (1989)\n(upholding contempt \"because there was 'a clear and undoubted disobedience\nof a clear and unequivocal command'\")--this Court should not even reach\nthe merits of BRI's arguments as to how the ambiguous provisions of the\nSettlement Agreement should be construed. Whatever tenets and extrinsic\naids may be applicable in construing a consent decree in other contexts, e.g.,\nin acting on a motion for clarification or modification or declaring the parties'\nrights and responsibilities under the decree, see, e.g..United States v. 1TT\nContinental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238 (1975), where, as here, a consent\n6Even in embrcing private, commercial consent decrees, v,-here such\nprudential considerations ate absent, courts will not \"reach beyond the strict terms\nof the decree to find [a defendant] in violation.\" AMF, 711 F.2d at 1107 (\"Just as\nwe do not think a court can ignore obvious violations, itneed not reach out for an\nexpansive interpretation.\")_\n-6-\n\ndecreeis ambiguous on its face, a party cannot properly be held in contempt\nfor violating its provisions. 7\nAs held by the United States Supreme Court, in reversing the\naffirmance of a contempt finding on the ground that the underlying decree\nwas \"too vague to be understood,\" \"[t]he most fundamental postulates of our\nlegal order forbid the imposition of a penalty for disobeying a command that\ndefies comprehension.\" lnt'l Longshoremen's Ass'n, Local 1291 v.\nPhiladelphia Marine Trade Ass 'n, 389 U.S. 64, 76 (1967). Similarly, in\nvacating contempt sanctions imposed on a federal agency, the Court of\nAppeals for the First Circuit held:\nFor a party to be held in contempt, it must\nhave violated a clear and unambiguous order\nthat left no reasonable doubt as to what\nbehavior was expected and who was expected\nto behave in the indicated fashion. \"In\ndetermining specificity, the party enjoined\nmust be able to ascertain from the four comers\nof the order precisely what acts are\nforbidden.\"\nProject BASIC, 947 F.2d at 17 (citations omitted).\nAnother example of a contempt finding being reversed because of the\nlack of clarity of the underlying order is the AMF case, relied upon by BRI\nfor another point. In that case, the court refused \"to reach beyond the strict\nterms of a decree\" to hold a party responsible for its failure to prevent others\nwithin its control from doing what the decree prohibited, on the grounds that\nthe decree imposed no such monitoring obligation directly on the party in\n7For this reason, many of the authorities relied upon by BRl--which deal\nwith the construction of consent decrees but not with the imposition of contempt\nsanctions, e.g., flT Continental Baking Co., supra; Juan F. v. Weicker, 37 F.3d 874\n(2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, I15 S.Ct. 2579 (1995); Abram Chayes, The Role of the\nJudge inPublic Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L.

Moreover, there isno evidence that any\ncou_ or patty relied to its detriment on DMR's prior acknowledgment of its party\nstatus.

Project BASIC, 947\nF.2d at 19. Because none of the provisions at issue here expressly requires\nor prohibits DMR to take an)' particular actions, see DMR Br. at 39-58, the\nfact that DMR is a party to the agreement as a whole falls far short of leaving\n\"no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was expected and who was\nexpected to behave in the indicated fashion.\" Project BASIC, 947 F.2d at 17\n(reversing contempt judgment against ItUD, a party to the decree and the\nunderlying case, on this ground); see also Spallone v.

As the Seventh Circuit forcefully held, where a party's\nconduct has been found to be in violation of an ambiguous order, contempt\nsanctions may not be imposed contemporaneously with the finding that the\ndecree has been violated.

Navarro-Ayala, 951 F.2d at 1341. In\nreaching this conclusion, the court emphasized the danger of broadly\nconstruing consent decrees against state officials:\nState officials entering into a consent decree\nate entitled to rely on courts to apply the\ndecree only to its agreed objects. Consent\ndecrees ate not like the camel's proverbial\nnose in the tent which, once inserted, gives the\nanimal free rein to come and go at will. The\nimprovement of [public institutions] will not\nbe advanced by giving state officials reason to\navoid entering into such arrangements in the\nfuture for fear they will be expanded beyond\ntheir language.\nld at 1343. To avoid the problems inherent in enforcing ambiguous decrees\nagainst state officials, courts must construe any ambiguities in favor of the\nalleged contemnor, not against him, Project Basic, 947 F.2d at 16; see also\nAMF, 711 F.2d at 1101, particularly where the case involves the exercise of\nprofessional judgment by agency officials. United States v.

MARC, 668 F.2d at 609; Gray v. Comm 'r\nof Revenue, 422 Mass. 666, 674-75 (1996); see also Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU\nv. Sec'yofAdmin., 413 Mass. 377, 383 (1992) (declining to adopt \"strained\nand constitutionally questionable interpretation\" of agreement with\nCommonwealth). By construing ambiguous provisions of the Settlement\nAgreement against the Commissioner and in a manner that brings the\nAgreement into conflict with his statutory and regulatory authority, and then\nby imposing contempt sanctions against him for violating the Agreement as\nso construed, the trial court vi¢lated the most fundamental principles both of\ncontempt law and of separation of powers: that a party can be held in\ncontempt only for violating a clear and unequivocal court order, and that\njudicial enforcement of consent decrees against public officials must be\nconducted in a manner that safeguards the autonomy of governmental entities\nto the \"maximum extent possible.\" Langton, 928 F.2d at 1221.\n1). BRI Erroneously Minimizes Its Burden of Demonstrating\nthat the Commissioner Directly and Undoubtedly Violated\na Clear and Unequivocal Provision of the Settlement\nAgreement\nIt should be undisputed, given the well-settled state of the law, that\na party seeking contempt has the burden of proving both that the order in\nquestion was clear and unequivocal and that the alleged contemnor directly\nand undoubtedly violated the order. See DMR Br. at 37-38, 58-59. Yet BRI\nappears to dispute both the locus and the substance of this burden.\nAs to the locus of the burden, BRI contends that, by introducing\n\"sufficient evidence\" of bad faith, it shifted the burden to the Commissioner\n-13-\n\ntoprovethathehadnotviolated the good faith provision of the Settlement\nAgreement. BRI Br. at 59, 85. In support of that proposition, BRI cites two\ncases and an evidence treatise. The first case, Rockdale Afanagement Co. v.\nStlawmut Bank, 418 Mass. 596 (1994), isboth legally and factually dissimilar\nto the present case. It is a fraud case rather than a contempt case; the remedy\nsought was merely dismissal of the action in which the fraud occurred; and\nthe wrongdoing in question (forging a letter and then testifying that it was\ngenuine) bears no resemblance even to the court's most critical findings\nconcerning the Commissioner's conduct. In any event, in that case, the Court\nheld that the party seeking the sanction bore the burden of proving, through\nclear and convincing evidence, that the fraudulent conduct was part of a\nscheme to defraud, ld. at 598, 600. Thus, to the extent this case is at all\nrelevant, it supports placing the burden of proof on BRI, not on the\nCommissioner.\nThe second case cited by BRI on this point was brought under the\n\"lemon law,\" which contains a statutory burden-shifting presumption, under\nwhich an arbitrator's finding that a car is defective shifts the burden to the\ndealer to prove the contrary. FordAfotor Co. v. Barrett, 403 Mass. 240, 242-\n43 (1988). That case clearly has no bearing on the burden of proof in a\ncommon law contempt case.\nThe treatise section cited by BRI deals with the allocation of the\nburden of production, not the burden of proof, and states that the burden of\nproduction shifts only \"when the evidence becomes such that the jury could\nreasonably find only for the other party.\" Hon. Paul J. Liacos, ltandbook of\nMassachusetts Evidence, § 5.6.2 at 225 (6th rev. ed. 1994). The piece of\nevidence that BRI relies upon, a report that DMR filed with the court in\nSeptember 1993, App. 147, of which the court took judicial notice during\nBRI's direct examination of its first witness on the first day of the three-week\ncontempt trial, falls far short of constituting such weighty evidence of\n-14-\n\ncontemptthat,havingreceivedit, thecourt\"couldreasonablyfindonlyfor\ntheotherparty.\" ,',lass.Evidence at 225. Indeed, as demonstrated in the\nCommissioner's opening brief, the court's findings concerning this report are\nclearly erroneous, See DMR Brief at 109-10. llowever, even if they were\ntrue--i.e., even if the report were misleading in not fully describing, or not\nincluding as exhibits, favorable internal recommendations of DMR field staff\non BRI's application for certification, A. 1239-40--it cannot be said that the\ncourt had no choice but to find the Commissioner in contempt of the\nSettlement Agreement, based on that evidence alone.\nBRI also erroneously minimizes both of the essential elements of its\nburden of proof--to show that the defendant (1) directly and undoubtedly\nviolated (2) a clear and unequivocal court order. In their briefs to this Court,\nnone of the appellees makes a serious effort to argue that the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement at issue here are clear and unequivocal. Rather, after\nmaking some conclusory statements as to the clarity of those provisions, BRI\nBr. at 58, 63; 1_Parents' Br. at 10; Students' Br. at 51, BRI and the other\nappellees quickly move on to argue that the trial court correctly construed the\n_3Theonly two cases cited by BRI in support of its conclusory statement\nthat \"[t]he terr:as of the Settlement Agreement impose clear and unequivocal legal\nobligations on DMR and the Commissioner,\" BRI Br. at 63, provide no support for\nthat proposition. In Commonweath v. One Ford Econoline Van, 413 Mass. 411\n(1992), the court order in question--requiring the Commonwealth to return a van\nwithin 10days---was undeniably clear; and the Commonweahh did not dispute the\nclarity of the order, only the possibility of complying with it. ld at 411-12. In\nMcKnight, 406 Mass. at 791, this Court did not opine on the clarity of the\nSettlement Agreement at all, but only made the axiomatic pronouncement that Ifthe\nDepartment violated paragraph Fof the Settlement Agreement (a provision that was\nnot invoked in the present case), \"it might be liable for breach of the agreemer_t and\nperhaps for contempt of court\" (emphasis added).\n-15-\n\nagreement to prohibit the conduct the Commissioner was found to have\nengaged in?4\nSimilarly, rather than attempt to shoulder its equally heavy burden of\ndemonstrating that the Commissioner directly and undoubtedly violated the\nSettlement Agreement, BRI takes on the less weighty, but legally insufficient,\ntask of demonstrating that the Commissioner's conduct was designed to\naccomplish, \"indirectly,\" what he could not achieve under the express terms\nof the Settlement Agreement. BR1 Br. at 84. BRI's repeated use of the word\n\"latent,\" BRI Br. at 59, 85--i.e., \"inactive,\" Webster's New World Dictionary\nat 762 (3rd college ed. 1991)--to describe the Commissioner's purportedly\ncontumacious conduct is particularly telling in this regard.\nIn accordance with the lower standard that BRI sets for itself, the\nconduct it relies upon as constituting violations of the Settlement Agreement\nis almost exclusively indirect. For example, while Part A of the Settlement\nAgreement does not prohibit or require any actions by the Commissioner,\nBILl contends that the Commissioner's certification decisions, \"[i]n effect,\"\nBRI Br. at 76, violated that provision, because they purportedly conflict with\nthe Probate Court's rulings in individual substituted judgment proceedings,\nv,'hich are required by Part A. tS BILl Br. at 74-77. Similarly, BKI contends\nthat the Commissioner violated Part C, which requires that \"intake at B.R.I.\nfor new clients.., shall not be impermissibly obstructed,\" by taking various\n\"indirect action[s],\" BRI Br. at 80, that purportedly had the effect of reducing\nBRI's enrollment? 6 BRI Br. at 79-80.\nJ4Appellees' lengthy arguments as to the proper construction of the\nSettlement Agreement further demonstrate that the agreement on its face is not\nsufficiently clear to support the contempt judgment.\n_SAsa matter of law, no such conflict exists.

Failed to Meet lts Burden of Demonstrating that the\nCommissioner Directly and Undoubtedly Violated At:),\nClear and Unequivocal Court Order.\nIn its brief, BRI attempts to delineate, as the trial court failed to do,\nsee DMR Br. at 38-39, what conduct by the Conmlissioner violated what\nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement.

This effort fails\nin many important legal and factual respects, which will be highlighted here\nwithout reiterating the arguments made in the Commissioner's opening brief\nat 37-61.\nl* BRI's Position on the Central Legal Issue in this\nCase---i.e., Whether the Settlement Agreement\nProhibits the Commissioner from Regulating\nBRI's Use of Aversive Procedures---Is Unclear and\nUnsupported as a Matter of Fact or Law.\nAt various points in its brief, BRI takes a range of contradictory\npositions as to whether and, if so, to what extent, the Settlement Agreement\nprohibits the Commissioner from regulating BRI's use of aversive\nprocedures. At some points, BRI appears to contend that, by entering into the\nSettlement Agreement, the Commonwealth waived all regulatory authority\nover BRI. 17 At other points, BRI seems to acknowledge that the\n_6(.,.continued)\nSee DMR Br. at 105-07, 146-47.\ntTSeeBRI Br. at 9 (\"Court Monitor would oversee [BRI]'s compliance with\nall applicable state regulations, except to the extent those regulations involved\ntreatment decisions, which were reserved for the Trial Court\"; \"[a]ll regulatory\ndisputes or concerns between the parties were required to be submitted to [the Court\nMonitor] for resolution\"); 51 (\"Settlement Agreement . . . vested treatment\nauthority inthe Court\"); 59 (\"Commissioner engaged incontempt...

BRI offers little, by way\nof legal analysis, in response to the authorities cited and legal arguments\nmade by the Conunissioner, demonstrating the lack of any conflict between\nthe Settlement Agreement or the substituted judgment rulings of the Probate\nCourt, on the one hand, and the Commissioner's exercise of his regulatory\nauthority to condition or revoke the use of Level 111aversives, on the other.\nSee DMR Br. at 39-46; McKnight, 406 Mass. at 789, 800-01 (despite fact that\nprobate court, exercising substituted judgment, had previously approved use\nof Level III aversives on BRI student, permanent injunction requiting DMR\nto make such treatment available might be improper; rejecting arguments that\nstudent has \"right to elect (pursuant to substituted judgment principles)\namong . . treatment procedures that are acceptable to qualified\nprofessionals\").\nIn response to the Commissioner's argument that the Probate Court's\napproval of a treatment in substituted judgment proceedings cannot operate\nto legalize a form of treatment prohibited by state law, DMR Br. at 44-46,\nBRI first makes the €onclusory statement that, by entering into the Settlement\nAgreement, the Commonwealth waived its authority to enforce state law\nagainst BRI. BR1 Br. at 74-75. BRI offers no legal support for this\ncontention, which begs the central question in this case. To the extent that\nthis contention is based on the factual premise that the parties or the trial\ncourt intended the Settlement Agreement to effect such a waiver, that premise\nis directly contradicted by the factual record. See DMR Br. at 41-42.\nMoreover, even if the agreement could be read to effect such a waiver, it\nwould be void and unenforceable as against public policy. Beacon Hill Ovic\nAss'n v.

While\nBRI characterizes various certification conditions as absolutely prohibiting\nBRI from using particular procedures, BRI Br. at 76, in fact the conditions\ndid not do so.\nIn his letter of August 31, 1993, the Commissioner did not prohibit\nBRI from using aversive procedures that were not then in use at BRI, as BRI\nfalsely states.

Rather, as stated in that letter itself, if BRI\nproposed to use other aversive procedures in addition to those currently in\nuse, BRI was required only to notify and meet with DMR regarding arty such\nproposal.

U-166; DMR Br. at 139-40.\nWhile the Conmlissioner's January 20, 1995, letter did prohibit BRI\nfrom using four particular treatments, BRI was not then using any of those\ntreatments except for the specialized food program. PI App. at 135-36.\nMoreover, that same prohibition was also contained in subsequent orders of\na Single Justice of the Appeals Court, BRI Supp. App. 133, 134, the merits\nof which are not challenged by BRI or any other party before this Court? s\nSee the Commissioner's appellee's brief in SJC-07045.\nIn characterizing the revocation of its certification as a \"unilateral\"\naction by the Commissioner, BRI Br. at 77, BRI neglects to mention that the\nsole ground for this revocation was BRI's unilateral refusal to comply with\nthe certification conditions over a two-month period, without seeking more\ntime or judicial or adminisuative review. See DMR Br. at 31. That fact is\nalso noticeably missing from BRI's Statement of the Facts, BRI Br. at 54, as\nis the fact that the court's preliminary injunction required BRI to comply with\nthe certification conditions pending a decision on the merits. P1 App. at 504.\nBRI did not appeal from that preliminary injunction, but, instead, touted it as\na victory. Ex. DMR-35 at 12.\nZ_lndenying BRI's request for relief from those orders, a Single Justice of\nthis Court (Abrams, J.) concluded that \"there was no abuse of discretion and there\nwas a supportable basis for the single justice's Orders.\" BRI Supp. App. 136.\n-22-\n\n1 BRI Misstates the Facts Concerning DMR's\nWillingness to Participate in Mediation.\nEven if the meaning and scope of the arbitration provision of the\nSettlement Agreement were sufficiently clear and unequivocal as to permit\ncontempt sanctions to be imposed for its violation, but see DMR Br. at 46-50,\nBRI fell far short of meeting its burden of proving that the Commissioner\nfailed to substantially comply with this provision. Contrary to BRI's\ncontentions, BRI Br. at 27, 35, 36, and the trial court's findings on this point,\nDMR repeatedly agreed to participate in mediation sessions with Dr.\nDaignault and then with his successor Judge Hard, while, at the same time,\nreserving its right to argue that mediation of certain disputes was not required\nby the Settlement Agreement) 6 See DMR Br. at 50; see also, e.g., Ex. U-96,\nU-98, U-114, U-124, U-182, DMR-79; Tr. VI1A:55.\nIn particular, with respect to the independent program evaluation by\nthe Rivendell team, it was DMR who requested mediation, Ex. U-110, which\nwas refused by the court monitor, Dr. Daignault, as beyond his jurisdiction,\nEx. BRI-251; while BRI brought its concerns about Rivendell directly to tLe\ncourt without first bringing them to the court monitor's attention. Ex. BR1-\n251, U-110. When the court subsequently referred that issue and others to\nthe court \"mediator,\" Judge Hurd, App. 214, the mediator permitted the\nevaluation to go forward, and BRI did not appeal that decision to the court for\nresolution under Part B(2) of the Agreement.\nWGiven the long history of contentious litigation between the parties both\nbefore and at_er the execution of the Settlement Agreement, such reservation of\nrights was understandable and prudent. Indeed, in agreeing to meet with DMR\nwithout the court monitor present, BRI conversely reserved its rights to argue that\nthe court monitor's presence was required by the SettlemEnt Agreement. Ex. BRI-\n245 at 2.\n-23-\n\nBRI Failed to Demonstrate that the Commissioner\n,\n\"Impermissibly Obstructed\" BRI's Intake of New\nClients.\nBRl's argument, BRI Br. at 79-80, as to the Commissioner's\ncontempt of Part C of the Settlement Agreement, which provides (in the\npassive voice) that BRI's intake of new clients \"shall not be impermissibly\nobstructed,\" rests exclusively on the factual premise that DMR's\ncommunications with other states' agencies resulted in those agencies not\nreferring new students to BRI, purportedly in violation of DMR's obligations\nunder Part C. Even if the Commissioner could b¢ held in contempt for\nconduct that is not expressly prohibited by the Settlemem Agreement, but see\nArguments IC and ID, supra; DMR Br. at 51-53, the factual premise for this\nargument is mistaken. See DMR Br. at 52-53, 101,105-07, 132-33,146-47.\nWith respect to New York State in particular, as discussed in the\nCommissioner's opening brief, DMR Br. at 133, that state's actions to\nremove students from BRI were motivated, not by any impetus from DMR,\nbut by New York legislation, enacted in 1994, which required state mental\nhealth and mental retardation agencies to transfer their adult clients from out-\nof-state to in-state placements, and New York City's decision to cease\nfunding out*of-state placements altogether. See generally Brooks v. Giuliani,\n84 F.3d 1454, 1456-58 (2d Cir. 1996) (describing legislation, related funding\ndispute between New York State and New York City, and resulting transfers\nof adult clients from out-of-state to in-state facilities); New York Council for\nExceptional People v. Pataki, 632 N.Y.S.2d 531 (App. Div. 1995) (related\nstate court litigation).\n-24-\n\nBRI Failed to Demonstrate that the Commissioner\no\nViolated Any Clear and Unequivocal Obligation\nUnder the Good Faith Provision of the Settlement\nAgreement.\nBRI's argument as to contempt of Part L of the Settlement\nAgreement--which requires that \"each party.., discharge its obligations\nunder the terms of this agreement, in good faith\"--begins with aquotation\nof the trial court's mischaractedzation of the Commissioner's position on\nthis issue. BRI Br. at 80. Contrary to that characterization, the\nCommissioner did not contend below that he has no legal obligation to act in\ngood faith; to the contrary, in her opening statement his counsel expressly\nacknowledged such an obligation. Tr. I:55, 64-66. What the Commissioner\ndoes contend, as correctly paraphrased by the trialcourt in anearlier finding,\nA. 1212-13, is thatthe Settlement Agreement requires only thathe act in good\nfaith\"in discharging his obligations under this agreement.\" Accordingly, if\nhe fails toact in good faith in other respects, his decisions may bechallenged,\nunder G.L.c. 30A, as arbitrary and capricious; the agency may be sued for\nbreach of contract, etc.; but the Commissioner may not be held in contempt\nof the Settlement Agreement on that basis alone. DMR Br. at53-58.\nBPd's protestations notwithstanding, the Seventh Circuit's decisions\nin the Board of Education case strongly support the Commissioner's\ncontention thatthe \"good faith\" provision of the Settlement Agreement is too\nambiguous to form the basis forcontempt sanctions. DMR Br. at 53-58. The\nprovision at issue in the Board of Education case ('7 15.1\") required the\nparties \"to make every good faith effort to find and provide every available\nform of financial resources adequate for the implementation of the\ndesegregation plan.\" Bd. of Edue. l, 717 F.2d at 380. In the first of three\nappeals fIom district court orders enforcing that provision against the United\nStates, the court of appeals found the \"district court incorrect inits ruling that\n-25-\n\n¶ 15.1 is unambiguous. ''27 Id. at 382. In reaching that conclusion, the court\ndefined \"ambiguous\" as \"reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning\"\nand found the \"broad language that permeates all of¶ 15.1\" and the word\n\"available,\" in particular, to fall within that definition. As evidence of the\nambiguity of that term, the court cited the differing arguments put forth by\nthe various parties as to its meaning. Id Under this standard, the good faith\nprovision in the Settlement Agreement, which is even less specific as to what\nis required than is ¶ IS.l, is hopelessly \"ambiguous,\" as evidenced by the\nvolume of ink that has been spilled by the trial court and the various parties\nin putting forth their diverse contentions as to the multifarious meanings of\nwhich that term is \"reasonably susceptible.\"\nIn its second opinion, the court of appeals held that the district court\nerred in construing the good faith provision in ¶ 15.1 to require the\ngovernment to request legislative appropriations to fund the desegregation\nplan. United States v. Bd of Educ., 744 F.2d 1300, 1306-07 (7th Cir. 1984)\n(\"Bd of Educ. If'). Contraryto BRI's characterization, the court did not hold\nthat \"legislative lobbying activities by the executive branch intending to\ndecrease funding available to desegrafion programs.., would be a violation\nof the express good-faith provision subject to contempt sanctions.\" BPd Br.\nat 82. Rather, v,.hile the court stated that such lobbying \"could be interpreted\nto contravene the spirit of the Decree ''2_ (emphasis added), the court\nexpressly declined to decide whether such activities constituted violations of\n_71nhis brief, the Commissioner accurately paraphrased that holding as\nfollows: \"(good faith provision not unambiguous).\" DMR Br. at 56. BRI's claim\nthat the Commissioner \"miscite[d]\" this holding, BRI Br. at 81, is clearly\nunfounded.\naBR1 misleadingly omits the qualifying phrase \"could be inteq_reteA\"from\nits quotation of this language. BRI Br. at 82.\n-26-\n\nthegood faith provision. _ Bd of Educ. I1, 744 F.2d at 1307-08; see also Bd\nof Educ. 1, 717 F.2d at 382.\nIn its third opinion, the court of appeals again vacated the district\ncourt's remedial orders, \"in part because of the lack of any direction as to the\nmeaning of [¶15.1] and in part because of the inherenl problems with\nordering relief against the government.\" Bd. of Educ. Ill, 799 F.2d at 289.\nIn addition to stating that \"what constituted good faith was not readi[)\napparent\" fi'om the language of the decree, id, the court repeatedly described\nthe good faith provision as \"ambiguous,\" \"inherently nebulous\" and\n\"uncertain. ''3° ld at 289, 291,292. On that ground, the court held that the\ndistrict court erred in imposing remedial orders based on a violation of that\nprovision, ld. at 291.\nOn declining to reach this question, the court noted, but prudently avoided,\nthe \"significant constitutional issue.., asto whether a finding of lack of good faith\nproperly can b¢ based upon.., aseries of sweeping Executive policy decisions and\nrecommendations,\" including requesting Congress to redu¢© or rescind\nappropriations and supporting other legislation. B_. ofEduc. IL 744 F.2d at 382.\nTo the extent that the trialcourt's contempt findings in this case were bawd on the\nCommissioner's subjective \"wishfl to testify on a bill before the legislature which\nwould 'prohibit aversive treatment,'\" A. 1218 (a desire that was never\nconsummated, due to BRI's objections, A. 1218), and on other \"policy decisions\nand recommendations\" made by him in his official capacity (e.g., questioning the\ntuition rate set for BRI by another state agency, A. 1258-59), those findings raise\nthe same serious constitutional issues. Indeed, atan earlier stage of this litigation,\nBRI's counsel acknowledged that a former Secretary of Human Services\n\"unquestionably\" had a first amendment right to testify against anti-aversive\nlitigation, even if such testimony might \"undermine\" the Settlement Agreement.\nEx. DMR-27 at II.\n3°While BRI accuses the Commissioner of missciting this case, it is BRI\nthat is guilty of doing so in its statement that \"the court held that the good faith\nprovision requiring the parties to use their best efforts to effectuate desegregation\nof the Chicago public schools was not in the least ambiguous or 'nebulous,'\" BRI\nBr. at 81-82, which is belied by the above direct quotations from the court's\nopinion.\n-27-\n\nTo the extent that some unequivocal meaning can be attributed to the\nterm \"good faith,\" lack of good faith must be narrowly construed, particularly\nin the contempt context, so as not to \"place an impossible burden on a\ndefendant.., to be absolutely right, and not merely reasonable.\" Parker v.\nD'Avolio, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 394, 402 (1996). As repeatedly held by this\nCourt and the Appeals Court, \"[B]ad faith is 'not simply bad judgment. It is\nnot merely negligence. It imports a dishonest purpose or some moral\nobliquity. It implies conscious doing of wrong. It means a breach of a\nknown duty through some motive of interest or ill will.'\" ld. at 402-03\n(quoting from Spiegel v. Beacon Participations, Inc., 297 Mass. 398, 416\n(1937)). Particularly \"in a complex factual and legal entanglement such as\nthis, it would be grossly unfair to bring down the potent weaponry\" of\ncontempt \"upon one who may guess wrongly about what a court will\nultimately do with the problem.\" Parker, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 403 (reversing\naward of damages and attorney's fees in Chapter 93A case). Thus, even if\nthe Commissioner's decisions to impose various conditions on BILl's\ncertification to use Level III aversives are deemed to be legally or factually\nincorrect, such errors could not form the basis for imposing contempt\nsanctions against him for violation of the good faith provision of the\nSettlement Agreement.\nAs a factual basis for its argtunent that the Commissioner violated the\ngood faith provision, BRI lists six actions purportedly taken by the\nCommissioner, with no citations either to the trial court's findings or to the\nunderlying evidence? _ BRI Br. at 81. In each case, BRI's descriptions of the\n_C[ Mass. R. App. P. 16(e) (\"No statement of a fact of the case shall be\nmade in any part of the brief without an appropriate and accurate record\nreference.\"); Service Publications, Inc. v.

BR1\nBr. at 19-20, 81,101. In fact, BRI knew about the 1991 team's favorable\nrecommendations at least since January 1992, when the team leader so\ninformed BRI, Ex. BRI.247 at 3, BRI-271, Dr. Israel's trialtestimony to the\ncontrary notwithstanding. Tr. VIIA:18-19. The teams' findings and\nrecommendations v,'ere also expressly alluded tointhe Commissioner's letter\nof August 6, 1993, Ex. U-82, and in DMR's September 1993 report to the\ntrial court. App. 147.\n(2) The Conunissioner's certification letters \"and other statements\"\n,,,,'erenot \"rife with false and defamatory statements,\" as BRI contends. BILl\nBr. at 81. Rather, the Commissioner troda good faith basis for all of the\nfactualstatements, legal conclusions, and conditions imposed in those letters.\nSee DMR Br. at26-31, 84-88, 94-110, !12-14, 130-36, 139-.42. Accordingly,\nas discussed above, even if some statements contained in those letters had\nbeen inaccurate as a matter of fact or law (which is not thecase), such errors\ncannot form the basis forthe extraordinary contempt sanctions imposed here.\nParker, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 402-03.\n(3) As discussed and documented in DMR's opening brief, DMR's\nSeptember 1993 reportto the court was neither false nor misleading. Rather,\nitaccurately described the then.current status of BRI's compliance with state\nlaw and regulations, as construed by DMR. DMR Br. at 109-10. Indeed, the\nonly \"misrepresentations\" identified by BPd are that this reportdid not fully\ndescribe or attach as exhibits the rejected internal recommendations of lower\n-29-\n\nlevel DMR officials that BRI be certified with relatively minor conditions) 2\nBRI Br. at 31-32, 115-16. Even if the trial court had jurisdiction to review\nthe merits of the Commissioner's certification decisions, but see DMR Br. at\n43 n.57, 57 n.80, 81 n.117, 141 n.206, the rejected internal recommendations\nof lower level officials would be immaterial to such review. Towns of\nNorfolk & Walpole v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 137 F.R.D.\n183, 186-87, 188 (D. Mass. 1991) (\"fact that there was divided opinion\nwithin art executive agency does not automatically imply bad faith\"; internal\nrecommendations properly excluded from administrative record), aft'd, 968\nF.2d 1438 (Ist Cir. 1992).\n(4) Contrary to BKI's next allegation, BRI Br. at 81, the conditions\nimposed on BRI's use of Level 11Iaversives on six individual students were\nneither unprecedented nor unauthorized. See DMR Br. at 141 & n.205.\n(5) While weekly staff meetings about an individual provider may\nhave been unusual, Tr. 111:200, the frequency of such meetings falls far short\nof evidencing a \"plot... to bring about JRC's downfalr' as BRI eon'ends.\nBRI Br. at 81. Similarly, although the Commissioner readily agreed that\nsome of the matters discussed at those meetings did not relate to BRI's\ncertification application per se, the fact that other BRl-related issues were\nsometimes discussed at those meetings does not in any way contradict the\nCommissioner's testimony that his sole purpose for scheduling weekly\nmeetings was to gather information concerning the certification application,\nJZlnparticular, BRIalleges that the report falsely stated that DMR staffhad\nrecommended \"further review.\" BR! Br. at 31. However, the factual record,\nincluding those portions cited by BRI insupport of that proposition, demonstrates\nthat further rev:ew was, in fact, recommended. Ex. U-75 at 6, 11 (recommending\nfurther review of data onGED m'.sfuings and on the specialized food program), Tr.\nV:45-50,VI:I03 (Commissioner so testified).\n-30-\n\nas he and the Assistant Commissioner consistently maintained. See DMR Br.\nat 121-23.\n(6) The sixth and final factual basis identified by BRI as grounds for\nfinding the Commissioner in contempt of the good faith provision of the\nSettlement Agreement--the Commissioner's purported\"harass[meat]\" of the\nCourt Monitor and guardian ad litem, BRI Br. at 81--is also legally and\nfactually unfoundzd. Nowhere in its brief does BRI identify what, if any,\nactions the Commissioner purportedly took to \"harass\" the guardian ad\nlitem, 33nor was there any evidence on that subject at trial? 4\nAs to the Court Monitor, the evidence demonstrates only that DMR\nraised legitimate concerns as to a possible conflict of interest (or appearance\nof such) on his part, after it came to DMR's attention that the Court Monitor\nhad been retained by BRI's attorneys or their other clients to provide expert\n\"Under a heading to that effect, BRI Br. at 108, there is no mention\nv,hatsoever of the guardian ad litem, only of the Court Monitor.\nr_There was evidence at trial that a question was raised at a DMR staff\nmeeting as to whether the guardian ad litem was related in some way to the medical\nexaminer who conducted an autopsy ofa BRI student. Tr. IV:73-77. However,\nthere was no evidence that anyone from DMR ever conducted an investigation of\nthis matter or even questioned (much less \"harassed\") the guardian ad litem on this\nsubject. To the contrary, DMR's Director of Investigations had no recollection of\neven being asked to investigate that question. Tr. XIIB:9, 36. And, based on the\nguardian ad litem's spontaneous offer, during the trial, to submit an affidavit on this\nissue, Tr. IV:78-79, itappears that she was not even aware of any such concerns on\nDMR's part prior to trial. Thus, the court's findings that DMR's \"efforts to\ninvestigate the GAL\" constituted an \"effort to intimidate\" her, App. 1262 n.49, were\nclearly erroneous.\nIn the court's post-trial findings, which accompanied the contempt\njudgment, the court belatedly took judicial notice of motions filed by DMR in\nindividual guardianship cases to remove the guardian ad litem for failing to do her\njob. A. 1262 n.49. DMR was given no opportunity tobe heard as to \"the propriety\nof taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed.\" Cf. Proposed Mass.\nR. Evid. 201(e); Fed. R. Evid. 201(e) (requiring such opportunity to be heard). In\nany event, filing such motions, per so, can hardly be characterized as \"harassment,\"\nmuch less a violation of a Settlement Agreement in another case.\n-31-\n\naffidavitsin another case against DMR) s See DMR Br. at 90-92. Such\nquestions, which remain unanswered to this day, due to the trial court's\nfailure to require the Court Monitor to disclose the information requested by\nDMR, 36see DMR Br. at 10-11 & n.21, can hardly be characterized as\n\"harassment.\"\nII. BR]'s COUNTER-ARGUMENTS ONTHE EVIDENTIARY ISSUES RAISED\nBYTHECOMMISSIONER ARE ENTIRELY _VITHOUT MERIT.\nA. BRI's Attempts to Defend the Trial Court's Rulings\nConcerning the Rule 30(b)(6) Deposition of BRI Are\nUna_,ailing.\nBRI's attempts to defend--(l) its failure to produce knowledgeable\nwitness(es) in response to the Commissioner's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition\nnotice, (2) the uial court's denial of the Commissioner's motion to extend the\ndiscovery period for this purpose, and (3) the trial court's rulings allowing\nBRI to present evidence at trial on the very subjects as to which BRI's sole\nRule 30(bX6) designee claimed a lack of knov_ledge--are totally unavailing\nas a matter of fact and law.\nThe cases cited by BILl on this issue are either entirely inapt or\nsupport the Commissioner's position. Two of these cases---United Slates v.\nGahagan Dredging Corp., 24 F.R.D. 328, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 1958), and Park &\nTilford Distillers Corp. v. Distillers Co., 19 F.R.D. 169, 171 (S.D.N.Y.\n1956)--predate Rule 30(b)(6) and hold deposition notices defective, not\nbecause they insufficiently described \"the subject matter of the deposition,\"\n3SBRl's allegation that DMR retained the Court Monitor for some purpose\nwas denied by the Court Monitor himself. Tr. IX:56; see also DMR Br. at 91-92\n& ,.130.\n36DMR did not bring this matter to the court's attention until the Court\nMonitor declined to provide this information unless ordered to do so by the court.\nSee DMR Br. at 90-91.\n-32-\n\nas BRI inaccurately states, BRI Br. at 88, but because they insufficiently\nidentified the deponent (as was required under the pre-1970 version of Rule\n39)? 7 In the only case cited by BRI in which a deposition notice was held\nto provide insufficient notice of the subject matter of the deposition, the\nnotice provided no description whatsoever of the subject matter. Operative\nPlasterers' & Cement Masons\" lnt'l Ass'n v. Benjamin, 144 F.R.D. 87, 89\n(ND. Ind. 1992). On the other hand, the deposition notice at issue in a case\ncited by BRI as an example of sufficient notice, Protective Nat '1Ins. Co. v.\nCommonwealth Ins. Co., 137 F.R.D. 267, 282 (D. Neb. 1989) (describing\nnotice as seeking testimony with regard to \"the factual basis for the\ncontentions contained in the counterclaim and answer and the factual basis\nfor the damages claimed\" by defendaa0 is strikingly similar to the one here,\nwhich sought testimony \"with regard to the factual basis for the allegations\ncontained in the Third Amended Contempt Complaint.\" A. 510; see also\nDMR Br. at 64-65.\nBRI's attempts to defend the trial court's refusal to remedy BILl's\nfailure to provide deponent(s) with knowledge of its financial condition,\neither by requiring BILl to provide additional deponents or by excluding\ntestimony on this subject at trial, are equally unavailing. BRI's suggestion\nthat DMR should have begun its discovery earlier is disingenuous, since\nDMR noticed its depositions on April 11, 1995, A. 510, within a week of the\ncourt's oral order on April 5, 1995, permitting discovery on BRI's Third\n371nfact, the Gahagan case was cited in the notes of the Advisory\nCommittee on Rules as an example of why Rule 30(bX6) was needed, i.e., because\n\"[s]ome courts have held that under the existing roles a corporation should not be\nburdened with choosing which person is to appear for it.\" Fed. R. Cir. P. 30\nadvisory committee's note. Rule 30(bX6), which expressly places that burden on\ncorporations, was added because, as noted by the Advisory Committee, \"[t]his\nburden is... lighter than that of an examining party ignorant of who in the\ncorporation has knowledge.\" ld.\n-33-\n\nAmendedContemptComplaint,which is not automaticallyallowedin\ncontempt cases. Mass. R. Cir. P. 65.3(g).\nBRI further claims that the Commissioner was not prejudiced by the\ncourt's permitting BRI's accountant to testify at trial as to BRI's financial\ncondition--the very subject on which its sole designated deponent claimed\na lack of knowledge---because BRI's offer of proof as to the substance of its\naccountant's testimony, which was not filed until the first day of trial, gave\nDMR sufficient \"opportunity to counter\" his testimony. BRI Br. at 89.\nHowever, the factual circunlstances in the cases cited by BRI in support of\nthat contention are very different from those presented here. In Eagan v.\nMart Scaffolding Co., 14 Mass. App. Ct. 1036 (1982), review denied, 388\nMass. 1102 (1983), the court found no prejudice in permitting a party to\nsubstitute one expert witness for another, where, unlike here, the opposing\nparty \"long had notice of the substance of the testimony expected... [and]\nhad an opportunity to---and did---depose each witness before testimony was\npresented.\" ld Similarly, in Wilson v. Hone)m'ell, Inc., 28 Mass. App. Ct.\n298, 304 & n. 5 (1990), aft\"d, 409 Mass 803,809-10 (1991), the court found\nno abuse of discretion in permitting a previously unidentified expert to testify\nas to lost wages, where the plaintiff had provided wage information at his\ndeposition and in his answers to interrogatories. By contrast, in the present\ncase, the Commissioner was severely prejudiced by the trial court's erroneous\nand inequitable rulings on this issue. See DMR Br. at 66.\nB. BRI's Arguments on Attorney/Client Privilege Have No\nFactual or Legal Basis.\nAt trial, the Commissioner claimed attorney/client privilege with\nrespect to two items on the agenda of staffmeetings on BRI. See DMR Br.\nat 124-30. In its brief, BRI parrots the trial court's factual findings\nconcerning the Commissioner's claim ofattomey/client privilege. BRI Br.\nat 124-25. However, as discussed in the Commissioner's opening brief, the\n-34-\n\ncourt'sfmdingsas to how and when the attorney/client privilege was raised\nby the Commissioner, challenged by BRI, and rejected by the court are\nclearly erroneous. DMR Br. at 124-26.\nIn its legal argument on attorney/client privilege, BRI characterizes\nthis matter as a discovery dispute. BRI Br. at 128. However, when the\nprivilege was claimed in discovery, BRI did not move to compel production\nof the redacted material but rather offered the redacted documents at trial as\n\"uncontested exhibits. ''38DMR Br. at 124. There was therefore no occasion\nfor the court to rule on the Commissioner's claim of privilege in the\ndiscovery context. Nor did BRI seek or the trial court impose any sanctio_\non the Commissioner for any discovery \"abuse. ''39 Although in its post-trial\nfindings the court gratuitously opines that the Commissioner's original claim\nof privilege, which was broader than what was ultimately pressed at trial,\n_SEven as late as the last week of trial, BKI's counsel disclaimed any\ninterest in\"anything that [DMR] still maintain[s] is privileged.\" Tr. X:69-70.\n_Nor would any such sanctions be warranted. A claim of attorney/client\nprivilege (which was ultimately abandoned), even ifdeemed to be unfounded, is in\nno way comparable to the fraudulent activities that were held sufficient cause for\nsanctions in the cases cited by BRL Cf. Rock,dale, 418 Mass. at 599 (upholding\ndismissal of complaint where phintiff forged a letter and then swore that it was\ngenuine in his answers to interrogatories); Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d\n1115, 1122 (Ist Cir. 1989) (upholding dismissal of complaint where plaintiff\nfabricated the agreement that was the basis for the complaint).\nMoreover, even much more serious discovery abuse does not warrant\nsanctions where the \"error d[oes] not injuriously affect [the opposing party's]\nsubstantial rights.\" Symmons v. O'Keeffe, 419 Mass. 288, 303 n.13 (1995). BRI\ndoes not allege that DMP,'s claim of privilege substantial!y interfered with its full\nand fair preparation orpresentation of its case. Anderson €. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d\n910, 924-25 (lst Cir. 1988) (burden on party seeking sanctions todemonstrate such\nprejudice). Nor could any claim of prejudice succeed, since BRI was permitted to\nrecall and cross-examine the Commissioner conceming the previously redacted\nmaterial that the court admitted into evidence during the trial. Tr. X:94, XI[[:51-\n123.\n-35-\n\n\"had no basis in fact or in law,\" App. 1250, thai issue was not before the trial\ncourt and is not raised as an issue in this appeal.\nThe narrower issue before the trial court, 4°and now before this Court,\nwas whether portions of two documents, as to which the Commissioner\ncontinued to press his privilege claim at trial, were admissible in evidence.\nOn that issue, BRI makes four arguments, none of which is meritorious.\nFirst, BRI argues that these items, which were entries on the agenda\nof DMR staff meetings attended by both lawyers and high-ranking members\nof DMR's non-legal staff, were not privileged because they were discussed\nby non-layovers as well as lawyers. BRI Br. at 127. The only case cited by\nBILl in support of this argument is plainly inapt; in that case, the\ncommunication in question was solely between two non-lawyers and was\nheld non-privileged on that ground. Barnes v. Harris, 61 Mass. (7 Cush.)\n576, 577-78 (1852). Nor does the fact that other DMR employees, in addition\nto the Commissioner, participated in the discussion of these items serve to\nrender the discussions non-privileged. Rather, as _cognlzed by the United\nStales Supreme Court, legal advice is often sought and obtained not only by\nthe highest ranking members of an organization but by middle and lower\nlevel employees as well; and such communications are equally in need of\nprivileged a-eatment. Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383,391 (1981).\nSee also DMR Br. at 127-28.\nSecond, BRI argues that the items in question--which concerned the\npossible applicability of certain conflict of interest provisions to the court\nmonitor and a potential request that the Attorney General prepare a\nreceivership petition for use in case of an emergency, Ex. BRI-293, BRI-\n294---are not privileged because they \"regard[ ] future fraudulent or unlawful\n4°Atuial, the court admired these items into evidence without expressly\nruling on the Commissioner's privilege claim. Tr.X:76-78; see also DMR Br.at\n126 & n.185.\n-36-\n\nconduct.\" BRI Br. at 127. Assuming that such a sweeping exception to the\nattorney/client privilege exists, 4_considering the applicability of conflict of\ninterest provisions and the possibihiy of requesting the Attorney General to\nprepare a receivership petition can hardly be considered \"fraudulent,\"\n\"illegal,\" or \"corrupt\" activities, as BRI contends. BRI Br. at 127. To the\nextent that this argument turns on what BRI views as the \"damaging\" nature\nof these documents, 42BRI Br. at 126, it certainly cannot be the case that the\nprivilege protects only innocuous communications that would be of no use\nto opposing parties in litigation or, conversely, does not protect harmful\ninformation. Cf. Martin v. Valley Nat 7Bank, 140 F.R.D. 291,306 (S.D.N.Y.\n1991) (attorney/client privilege \"cannot be overcome simply by a showing\nof need\").\nThird, BRI claims that the fact that th=se documents were labeled\n\"Policy Development\" (as well as \"Privileged\") somehow indicates that they\ndid not contain any privileged attorney/client communications. BRI Br. at\n127. In fact, the significance of the label \"Policy Development\" derives from\nthe Public Records Act, G.L.c. 66 (1994 ed.), which exempts from\n4_The only case cited by BRI on this point concerns an entirely different\nexception tothe privilege. Pcmell v.Rosa, 228 Mass. 594 (1918) (holding privilege\ninapplicable to communications between deceased testator and her attorney, where\nwill is subsequently challenged on _ounds oftestator's unsoundness of mind).\n42As discussed in DMR's opening brief, the inferences of sinister intent\ndrawn by the trial court from the reference to \"receivership\" were clearly erroneous.\nSee DMR Br. at 102-04. In any event, contrary to BRI's unsupported assertion,\nBRI Br. at 40, there isno evidence that DMR ever requested the Attorney General\nto prepare a receivership petition, orthat any such petition was ever drafted, much\nless filed.\nWith respect to the item concerning Dr. Daignault's potential conflict of\ninterest, there is no evidence that, a_r raising this issue at a staff meeting and\nobtaining some reference materials from American Psycholgy Association\n(\"APA\"), Dr. Cerreto took any action to file a complaint against Dr. Daignault with\nthe APA. Cf. BRI Br. at 39. To the contrary, Dr. Cerreto testified that she did not\npursue this issue. Tr.X:127-28.\n-37-\n\nmandatory public disclosure \"intra-agency memoranda.., relating to policy\npositions being developed by the agency.\" G.L. €. 4, § 7, el. 26(d) (1994\ned.); see Babets v. Sec 'y of Executive Office of Human Services, 403 Mass.\n230, 237 n.8 (1988). At the time these documents were generated, in\nSeptember 1993, DMR was still in the process of making the policy decision\nof whether, and on what conditions, to renew BRI's certification to use Level\nIII aversives. Until that decision was made, these documents could have been\nw!'r_eld in response to a public records request, as the label \"Policy\nDevelopment\" indicates. By the time the documents were released in\ndiscovery, the certification decision had already been made, so no attempt\nwas made to withhold the documents on this ground. Rather, DMR released\nthe documents as a whole but redacted only those portions for which\nattorney/client privilege was claimed? 3\nBecause the Commissioner had a valid basis for claiming the\nattorney/client privilege with respect to these two items, the trial court erred\nin admitting them into evidence over his objections and then compounded\nthat error by equating this legitimate claim of privilege with a \"fraud on the\ncourt.\" App. 1308. Because this \"fraud\" was a principal basis for holding\nthe Commissioner in contempt and placing the Deparment in receivership,\nApp.1308, 1310, this compound error is exceedingly prejudicial.\nIIL BRI MISSTATES AND MISAPPLIES THE STANDARD OF AFPELLATE\nREVIEW OF THE TRIALCOURT'S FACTUAL FINDINGS.\nIn response to the Commissioner's plea that this Court scrutinize the\nrecord with particular care due, in part, to the great extent to which the trial\ncourt adopted its findings virtually verbatim from the proposed findings of\nBR1, DMR Br. at 70-73, BRI makes the conclusory statements that the trial\ncourt \"significantly reworked the proposed findings of [BRI],\" \"rewrote\n_rlhe full names of BRI students were also redacted in order to protect the\nstudents' privacy.\n-38-\n\n[BRI's proposedI findings in drafting her own findings,\" \"painstakingly\n&_afled her o_ findings regarding the core issues of the case,\" and \"drafted\nher own distinctive findings.\" BRI Br. at 93, 95. Not only are BRI's bald\nassertions as to the trial court's independent authorship of its own findings\nunsupported by any citations to any particular findings, they are flatly belied\nby the separately bound Addendum to Argument ili of DMR's brief, which\nreproduces, side-by-side, the trial court's findings and BRI's proposed\nfindings on the same subjects, thereby graphically demonstrating that\nvirtually all of the trial court's findings are adopted almost verbatim from\nBRI's proposed findings. _ As demonstrated therein, the extent of the\nverbatim adoption in this case far exceeds that which occurred in any of the\ncases cited by either DMR or BRI on this point? s\nIn its argument concerning the scope of appellate review of factual\nfindings in general, BRI miseharacterizes the Comissioner's arguments on\nthis point. The Commissioner does not argue that the trial court simply chose\nincorrectly between \"conflicting facts which are equally supported in the\nrecord. '_ BILl Br. at 97-98. Rather, the Commissioner argues, and then\nUSee also DMR Br.at 77 n.l 12,80 n.I16, 84 n.120, 88n.125, 90 n.128, 93\nn.132, 94 n.135, 105 n.155, 109 n.160, Ill n.162, 112 n.165, 114 n.t67, 121 n.178,\n130 n.190, 132 n.193, 134 n.195, 137 n.201,139 n.204, 143 n.208, 145 n.212, 146\nn.215 (citing, for each subject on which findings were made, the trial court's\nfindings and the corresponding proposed findings of BRI).\n°The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has admonished\ntrial judges in that circuit to avoid the practice of adopting proposed findings\nverbatim, except in extraordinary cases, unlike this one, where the subject matter\nis highly technical and requires expertise that the trialjudge does not possess. See\nIn re Las Colinas, Inc., 426 F.2d 1005, 1009 (lst Cir. 1970).\n_If all the trial court did were to choose between conflicting facts that are\nequally supported in the record, the Commissioner agrees that it would not be\nappropriate for this Court to second-guess the trial's court's choices. However,\neven in those few instances where there were two supported versions of the\nfacts--for example, the precise content and tenor of a 1991 telephone\nconversation--the court did not simply choose to reject the Commissioner's version\n(continued...)\n-39-\n\npainstakinglydemonstratesfi,nding by finding,thatthereis noevidence\nwhatsoevetor supportmostof thefactualfindingsmadeorinferencedsrawn\nbythetrialcourt, and that, in many h_stances, other evidence in the record,\nwhich was disregarded by the trial court, unequivocally establishes the\nopposite of what the court found. See DMR Br. at 76-149.\nNor does the Commissioner argue that \"the entire contents of the\ncertification letters must be deemed as true by the factfinder by virtue of the\nletters being offered into evidence,\" as BILl contends. BRI Br. at 98 n.25.\nRather, because these letters were offered as \"uncontested exhibits,\" i.e.,\nexhibits as to which no objections, except as to relevance, were raised by\neither party, A. 415, the Commissioner simply pointed out that the letters\nconstituted evidence as to the truth of their contents, which should have been\nso considered by the trial court, particularly where there was no evidence the\ncontrary. DMR Br. at 88 n.124, 99.\nAs discussed in DMR's opening brief, most of the facts found by the\ntrial court are entirely immaterial to the legal issue in this contempt case, i.e.,\nwhether the Commissioner violated any clear and unequivocal court order.\nDMR Br. at 39, 42-43, 45-46, 50, 52-53, 60-61. The immateriality of most\nof the court's findings is graphically confirmed by BRI's brief, in which\nmost of the facts set forth in the statement of the case are not even mentioned\nin BRI's legal arguments, except in its arguments as to the accuracy of the\nfactual findings themselves. _7 Accordingly, the Commissioner cannot and\n_(...continued)\nof the disputed facts but went on to make the entirely baseless finding that the\nCommissioner's version was\"blantantly false\" and intentionally untruthful. App.\n1233; see DMR Br. at 93-94.\n47Among the patently immaterial facts that BRI discusses at length are\nthose concerning DMR's selection of the Rivendell Group to conduct an\nindependent review of BRI's program, BRI Br. at 33-37, I 18-22; the selection of\nDr. Gunner Dybwad to serve on BRI's Haman Rights Committee, BRI Br. at I15,\n(continued...)\n-40-\n\nwill not attempt, in this necessarily limited reply brief, to point out each of\nthe many inaccurate and unsupported factual statements contained in BRI's\nbrief. 48 Rather, the factual statements pertinent to Bgl's legal arguments are\n47(...continued)\nand the Commissioner's actions in anticipation of \"the Connie Chung show,\" a\ntelevision documentary on BPd. BRI Br. at 20-21,107-08. BRI does not even\nattempt to argue that the Settlement Agreement clearly and unequivocally\nprohibited the Commissioner from taking these actions. Nor was there any\nevidence or any findings that these action_ adversely affected BRI in any way. See\nDMR Br. at 88-90, 111-12, 114-20.\naA few representative misstatements can quickly be corrected, simply by\nreferring to the pages of the record cited by BRI:\n(I) While BRI states in itsbrief that the \"Commissioner admitted that he\nwas aware on December 15, 1993, that DMP, had sufficient information to conduct\nan investigation [ofa student's death] in 1991,\" BRI Br. at 129-30, the transcript\npages cited by BRI in support ofthat statement, Tr. VI: 115, 118-19, 122, reveal that\nthe Commissioner's answer of\"yes,\" to one of a long series of confusing questions\nas to the dates in question, Tr, VI:119, cannot fairly be characterized as an\n\"admission\" of anything.\n(2) While BRI states the \"It]be Commissioner admired at trial that he was\naware on August 6, 1993 that the DMR clinicians had written favorable reports\nfrom 1987through 1993 on [BRI]'s treatment programs and procedures,\" BRI Br.\nat 24, the transcript pages cited by BR1 contain repeated denials by the\nCommissioner of such awareness on his part. Tr. 111:37-43, 110-11.\n(3) While BRI states that one of the \"Commissioner's conditions...\nrequired.., funding and placement agencies to establish.., an alternative available\nplacement for every client placed at [BRI]\" and to \"maintain and fund two\nplacements simultaneously for [each] student,\" BRI Br.at 27, the certification letter\ncited by BRI reveals that the condition in question actually required such agencies\nonly to develop a \"plan for each resident to address the funding and logistics\" of\nproviding services in the event of unexpected emergencies. Ex. U-91 at 5.\n(4) While BRI states that \"It]he Commissioner testified.., that [a] pre-\nmeeting with DPS [the Division of Parchased Services] was not permitted by the\napplicable regulations,\" BRI Br. at 140, in fact, the Commissioner answered \"no\"\nto a question as to whether he was \"aware of any authorization in DPS's\nregulations,\" Tr. 11I:267, but further stated, _'Idon't think it's disallowed by the\nregulations either,\" id., which is an accurate characterization of the regulations\nthemselves. Ex. BRI-292. Moreover, there was no evidence or finding that any\n(continued...)\n-41-\n\naddressed in the context of responding to those arguments. As to the many,\nmany other, immaterial misstatements of fact, the Commissioner vail rely on\nhis own fully documented statement of the case, DMR Br. at 2-33, and\narguments as to the erroneousness of the court's findings, DMR Br. at 75-\n149, which anticipate and correct most, if not all, of the factual mistatements\ncontained in BRI's brief.\nIV. BRI MISSIATES AND MISAPPLIES TIlE LAW RELATING TO\nEQUITABLE RELIEF AND RECEIVERSHIPS AGAINST STATE\nOFFICIALS.\nThe authorities cited by BRI, purportedly supporting the sweeping\ninjunctive and receivership orders imposed by the trial court, BRI Br. at 147-\n56, actually bolster the arguments made in the Commissioner's opening brief\non this issue. DMR Br. at 149-63.\nA. BRI blinimizes the Serious Separation of Powers Problems\nPresented by the Court's Remedial Orders.\nWith respect to the propriety of granting equitable relief against state\nofficials in general, this Court has repeatedly cautioned, in the very cases\ncited by BILl, that the trial court's ordinarily broad discretion to fashion\nequitable remedies is more limited, due to separation of powers concerns,\nwhere the orders \"involve[ ] a State agency and the expenditure of public\nfunds.\" McKnight, 406 Mass. at 791 ;49see also DMR Br. at 150-59; DMR\n,a(...continued)\nsuch \"pre-meeting\" ever took place.\n(5) While BRI states that the president of the Rivendell Group \"described\nDr. Israel's views on aversives as 'out of balance,'\" BKI Br. at 36, the document\ncited as making that statement, Ex. BRI-311, actually refers to \"Opra[h]'s show\"\nas being in need of\"balane¢.\"\n°in its arguments on the propriety of the remedies imposed by the trial\ncourt, BRI repeatedly cites and quotes at length from the dissenting opinion inthe\nMcKnight case, Bill Br. at 150, 153, which, by definition, is directly contrary to\nthe Court's holdings inthat case.\n-42-\n\nPI Br. at 49-53. In order to minimize any intrusion on executive branch\nprerogatives, equitable relief against state agencies must be narrowly tailored\nto address the particular violations of law found and \"must allow the agency\nto exercise its discretion within the legal requirements\" identified by the\ncourt. Correia v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 414 Mass. 157, 168, 170 (1993).\nThese well-settled principles of judicial restraint were recently reaffirmed by\nthe U:fited States Supreme Court, which admonished, in vacating an overly\nbroad injunction against a state agency, that \"[i]t is the role of courts to\nprovide relief to claimants.., who have suffered, or will imminently suffer,\nactual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to\nshape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the\nlaws.\" Lewis v. Case),, 64 U.S.L.W. 4565, 4588 (U.S. Jane 24, 1996).\nBRI seeks to overcome the pervasive separation of powers problems\ninherent in the trial court's orders, BRI Br. at 151-52, by relying on an\nexception to the general rule of judicial restraint that exists where the relief\nimposed by the court is necessary to bring a state agency into compliance\nwith its constitutional or statutory obligations, s° Attorney General v. Sheriff,\n394 Mass. at 631; Bradley v. Comm 'rof Mental Health, 386 Mass. 363,365\n(1982) (distinguishing Perez v. BHA, 379 Mass. 703 (1980), and Blaney v.\nComm'r of Correction, 374 Mass. 337 (1978), on this ground)? I As\n_°Even i;i those circumstances, \"courts normally will not direct how the\npublic official should exercise thatstatutory du_y,\" Attorney General v.Sheriff, 394\nMass. 624, 630 0955); nor may they abrogate or usurp the statutory fights or\npowers of third parties. Spencev. Reed€r, 382 Mass. 398,418 (19gt).\nSqnquoting from the Brodley case, in support of its argument thatthe trial\ncourt's orders do not offend separation of powers principles, BRI significantly\nomits (without ellipses) the word \"statutory\" from the following quotation: \"Nor is\nthere any demonstrated basis for concluding that the DMH has broadly abrogated\nitsstatutory duties in the face of ajudicial direction to fulfil them, thus justifying\nthe issuance of an order concerning the carrying out of an executive function\"\n(emphasis added). Compare Bradley, 386 Mass. at365, and BRI Br. at 152.\n-43-\n\nexplained by this Court in Spence, 382 Mass. at 414-15, 417, where a\nreceivership is imposed in order to remedy a statutory violation, its intrusion\non legislative powers isjustified \"by the achievement of the greater statutory\ngoal\" and, for that reason, does not run afoul of Article 30. For example, the\nreceivership imposed by the court in the Perez case \"was not a usurpation of\nlegislative prerogative. It was an attempt to implement the legislative\nmandate that public housing meet certain minimum standards.\" Spence, 382\nat 418. Moreover, where such relief is based on the court's interpretation of\na legislative enactment, there is a built-in safeguard if the judiciary intrudes\nunduly on legislative powers: \"If... the court has misassessed the legislative\npurpose, the Legislature can change the governing legislation.\" Id. This\nexception and its underlying rationale have no beating where, as here, the\nrelief in question is imposed, not to :emedy a statutory violation, bu4 instead,\nto further \"some judicially devised objective,\" id. at 415, such as compliance\nwith the court's interpretation of the Settlement Agreement in this case.\nAccordingly, Article 30's limitations on judicial power apply in full force\nhere.\nIn accordance with basic separation of powers principles, this Court\nhas repeatedly held it inappropriate for a trial court to supplant an agency's\ndiscretion as to how to perform its executive functions (including,\nparticularly, the executive function of coordinating the provision of state-\nfunded services) in compliance with the applicable law. Care and Protection\nofderemy, 419 Mass. 616, 622-23 (1995); Care and Protection of Isaac, 419\nMass. 602, 606-07 (1995); Correia, 414 Mass. at 157; McKnight, 406 Mass.\n.44-\n\nat 792, 798; Bradley, 386 Mass. at 365 (1982). _2 Therefore, assuming,\narguendo, that some remedy was warranted here, raffler than totally supplant\nthe Commissioner's authority to regulate BKI, the court should have followed\nthe more prudent route mapped out by this and other courts--that is, first\nclearly define the Commissioner's legal obligations (which, as discussed\nabove, neither the Settlement Agreement nor the court's contempt findings\ndo) and then leave it up to the Commissioner, not to a court-appointed\nreceiver, to develop and implement a plan for compliance. McKnight, 406\nMass. at 801; Blaney, 374 Mass. at 342-43; Lewis, 64 U.S.L.W. at 4592; Bd\nofEduc. L 717 F.2d at 384; Bd of Educ. 111,799 F.2d at 289; Palmigiano,\n700 F. Supp. at 1199.\nJudicial restraint in fashioning relief is particularly important in the\ncontempt context. Because of\"the contempt power's virility and damage\npotential .... in levying contempt sanctions, the court must exercise the least\npossible power suitable to achieve the end imposed.\" Project BASIC, 947\nF.2d at 16; see also Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990).\nThis is particularly true where, as here, the provisions of the court order in\nquestion are far from unambiguous. Bd of Ed I11,799 F.2d at 292 n.8 (\"more\nrestrained role for the [trial] court.., necessitated by the broad language of\n[the decree]\").\nS2This Court vacated the order at issue in the Bradley case not \"only\"\nbecause there was no showing that the defendant agency had abrogated its duties\nin violation of a court order, as BK! states, BKi Br. at 152, but also, and primarily,\nbecause the order exceeded the inherent authority of the courts and impermissibly\nintruded on that of the executive branch. Bradley, 386 Mass. at 365. Like the order\nat issue in the Bradley case, the trial court's orders here were not necessary toavoid\ninterference with an essential judicial function, such as committing persons tojail.\nCf. Attorney General v. Sheriff, 394 Mass. at 631 (upholding court order to\nconstruct jail, partially on that ground). BRI mistakenly relies on the Bradley case,\nwhich vacates a relatively narrow court order on separation of powers grounds, as\nstanding for the opposite proposition---\"that a trial court has the power to\nsupplement any and all executive functions where.., the record indicates the need\nfor such sweeping relief.\" BRI Br. at 152.\n-45-\n\nB. BRI Exaggerates the Harm on Which the Trial Court\nPredicated Its Sweeping Remedial Orders.\nA further deficiency ',vith the court's orders here is also highlighted\nby the cases relied upon by BRI. Despite BRI's and the trial court's rhetoric\nto the contrary, the harm to BRI found here is insufficiently serious and\nsystemic to warrant the drastic and far-reaching relief imposed. Bradley, 386\nMass. at 365 (order vacated based, in part, on lack of _idespread violations);\nCorreia, 414 Mass. at 158 (preliminary injunction vacated because not\nnarrowly tailored to address violations that plaintiffwas likely to succeed in\nestablishing).\nFirst of all, BRI's brief at 54-57, 144-47, 155---like the trial court's\nfindings, see DMR Br. at 146-49, 152-53--grossly exaggerates the damage\nparportedly caused by the Commissioner's regulatory actions. In particular,\nBILl repeatedly asserts that its enrollment dropped from 66 students in 1993\nto 44 students \"at the time of trial.\" BRI Br. at 55, 145, 155. These numbers,\neven if accurate, fail to demonstrate any chronological, much less causal,\nconnection between the Commissioner's communications with out-of-state\nagencies--which occurred primarily from the late summer of 1993 to the\nearly spring of 1994, BILl Br, at 79-80--and the decline in\nenrollment--which did not occur to any significant degree until the end of\n1994, _ and did not fall below 50 students until June of 1995, the month of\nthe trial. Tr. VIII:I70. Much more telling in this respect is the undisputed\nfact that BRI had at least as many students (57) in the summer of 1994 as it\nhad in 1991 when it first applied for recertification. See DMR Br. at 53 n.74,\n147 n.217. Moreover, as discussed above, New York students were removed\n_Tr. VllB:52 (BRI lost only 4 students from August 1993 to the end of\n1994), Ex. BRI-262 (census was 64 as of January 1994; rate request for FYI995\nbased on enrollment of 65), VI1A:96 (census was 60 as of February 1994), Ex.\nDMR-2 at 16 (census was 64 as of April 1994).\n-46-\n\nfrom BR1 in late 1994 and early 1995 due to New York State legislation and\nNew York City policy decisions rather than to any communications from\nDMR. See Brooks, 84 F.3d at 1456-58.\nBRI's allegations of f'mancial hart, I, and resulting layoffs, BRI Br. at\n56, 145, 155, are also overstated. The layoffs that occurred in fiscal year\n1994, when most of the regulatory activity occurred, did not involve direct\ncare staff, Tr. VIIB:54, and were due not to lost revenues, since enrollment\ndid not drop sharply during that period. Instead, these layoffs were due to\nBPd's extraordinarily high expenditures on attorney's fees, Tr. ViIB:51-52,\nwhich, in turn, were due, irt large part, to BRI's own decisions to utilize its\nlavo'ers for nonlegal tasks, to file and aggressively litigate various motions\nand complaints, and to conduct heavy affirmative discovery during that\nperiod. See DMR Br. at 168. Moreover, because BRI was being reimbursed,\nthrough its tuition rate, for its attorneys' fees during this period, Ex. BRI-262,\nit is unclear why its fee expenditures necessitated any layoffs at all. While\nBRI claims that its surplus has been \"negatively impacted,\" BRI Br. at 56,\nthat projection was based on the worst-case scenario of BRI's enrollment\nremaining at43. Tr. 111:i71. Moreover, even under that scenario, the amount\nof its projected surplus for 1995 was only slightly less than in 1993. See\nDMR Br. at 147.\nEven if the harm purportedly suffered by two BRI students, as a\nresult of the termination of the specialized food program in mid-June 1995,\nis taken to be true, but see DMR Br. at 148-49, 162-63, that harm would fall\nfar short of justifying the sweeping relief imposed by the trial court. Cf.\nMcKnight, 406 Mass. at \"/94, 801 (permanent injunction would not be\nwarranted to prevent harm that one student would suffer if aversives were\ndiscontinued). As recently recognized by the United States Supreme Court,\nonly two instances of actual injury to class members are \"_ patently\ninadequate basis for . . . imposition of systemwide relief.\" Lewis, 64\n-47-\n\nU.S.L.W.at4591. Asexplainedby the Supreme Court in that case, the\nrequirement of demonstrating systemic injury as a predicate for systemic\nrelief is necessary to preserve the appropriate separation of powers between\nthe judicial and political (i.e., executive and legislative) branches of\ngovernment:\n[T]he distinction between the two roles would\nbe obliterated if, to invoke the intervention of\nthe courts, no actual or imminent harm were\nneeded, but merely the status of being subject\nto a governmental institution that was not\norganized or managed properly .... The\nactual-injury requirement would hardly serve\nthe purpose . . . of preventing courts from\nundertaking tasks assigned to the political\nbranches.., if once a plaintiff demonstrated\nharm from one particular inadequacy in\ngoverment administration, the court were\nauthorized to remedy all inadequacies in that\nadministration.\nld. at 4588, 4590.

Sec'y of Executive Office of\nCommunities & Dev., 418 Mass. 452,464 (1994) (\"[e]rrors in the agency's\nhandling of a single applicant's ease do not warrant [injunctive] relief\").\nTHIS COURT SHOULD STAY THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDERS PENDING\nVJ\nDECISION OF THESE APPEALS.\nag BRI Misstates the Standard of Review Applicable to the\nCommissioner's Renewed Request for a Stay Pending\nAppeal\nIn its decision of January 12, 1996, this Court dismissed, on BILl's\nmotion, the Commissioner's appeal from the Single Justice's order denying\nrelief under G.L.c. 211, § 3; and denied the Commissioner\" motion, to the\nfull Court, for a stay pending appeal; but invited the Commissioner to \"renew\nhis request for a stay of the [trial court's] injunctive and receivership orders\n-48-\n\ninhisbriefonthemeritsofth[is] appeal,\"Comm 'r of Mental Retardation v.\nJudge Rotenberg Educ. Center. Inc., 421 Mass. 1010 (1996), which he did.\nDMR Br. at 160-63. Despite that procedural history, BRI now contends that\nthe Commissioner's renewed request to the full Court for a stay pending\nappeal should be treated as if it were, instead, an appeal from the denial of\nrelief by a Single Justice. BRI Br. at 157. That contention is obviously\nincorrect; rather than apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard that\nwould be applicable to this Court's review of an order of a Single Justice, this\nCourt should apply, de novo, the standards applicable to a stay pending\nappeal.\nB. A Stay Is Necessary to Prevent Serious, Ongoing, and\nIrreparable Harm to DMR and the Public.\nIn opposition to the Commissioner's renewed request for a stay\npending appeal, BRI attempts to minimize the scope and impact of the relief\ngranted by the trial court. BRI Br. at 159-60. However, the actions already\ntaken by the Receiver, pursuant to the trial court's orders, graphically\ndemonstrate that, at least in the Receiver's view, his powers are not as\nnarrowly circumscribed as BRI claims. To the contrary, as anticipated in the\nCommissioner's opening brief at 161-62, the Receiver's powers, as actually\nexercised, extend to all aspects of the Department's operations, not just to its\ninteractions with BRI, and affect third parties as well, including other\nvendors, the parents and guardians of all consumers presently or potentially\nserved by DMR, and all DMR employees.\nAs documented in the exhibits to the Affidavit of Deputy\nCommissioner Gerald J. Morrissey, Jr. (\"Morrissey Aft.,\" filed herewith),\namong the intrusive actions taken by the Receiver to date are the following:\n(1) Rather than delegate his regulatory authority to DIVlR employees,\nas authorized by the trial court, App. 1347, and as urged by DMR, Morrissey\nAft., Ex. D, the Receiver appointed his own staff, ld., Ex. C, T, U. Some\n-49-\n\nof the Receiver's appointees were appointed over DMR's objections, based\non the appointees' financial relationships with either BRI or the court\nmonitor, Dr. Daignault. ld, Ex. D, E. On February 6, 1996, the court\napproved the Receiver's budget of almost $300,000 for the last six months\nof fiscal year 1996, id, Ex. A, B; and, as of June 18, 1996, DMR had been\nordered to pay a total of $68,367.72 to the Receiver and his stall. Id, Ex. T,\nU.\n(2) The Receiver has directed that no contract be awarded to any\nvendor without his prior review and approval, ld, Ex. F, G, I. In the\nmeantime, while the Receiver and his staff review all pending contract\nawards, consumers must walt for critically needed services, including\nemergency services for families in crisis. Id, Ex. J, K.\n(3) The Receiver is also reviewing contracts previously awarded by\nDMIL id., Ex. F, presumably to determine whether those contracts should be\nrescinded and awarded to BRI instead, as the trial court authorized him to do.\nApp. 1346.\n(4) The Receiver has contacted the parents and guardians of students\npreviously discharged from BILl to determine whether the students were\nremoved from BRI as a result of \"improper or undue influence\" by DMR.\nSee, e.g., Morrissey Aft., Ex. H,\n(5) Rather than merely ensure that DMR considers BRI equally with\nother providers for new placements, as the Settlement Agreement requires,\nApp. 130, the Receiver is taking \"affirmative steps\" to promote BILl over\nother providers. Morrissey Aft., Ex. G, I. Specifically, the first Receiver,\nJudge Nixon, s*directed DMR to \"reconstitute\" BRI's student population by\nplacing 25 additional state-funded students at BRI, id., Ex. G, I, L, and\nU'lhe first Receiver, retired Judge James J.Nixon, resigned €ffective April\n30, 1996, and was replaced by retired Judge Lawrence T. Perera. Mon'issey Aft.,\nEx. M.\n-50-\n\nthreatenedto seek contempt sanctions against individual DMR employees if\nthis quota was not satisfied promptly, ld., Ex. 1. Despite DMR's counsel's\nexplanation.as to w'hy it is not legally or practically feasible for DMR to\ncomply ,_ith this directive, Morrissey Aft., Ex. J., it has not been rescinded\nby the present Receiver, Judge Perera.\n(6) When an investigator from the Office of Civil Rights of the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services contacted DMR\nconcerning a civil rights complaint that was apparently triggered by the\nReceiver's reconstitution orders, the Receiver directed DMR not to provide\nthe information requested by the federal investigator without the Receiver's\nexpress wxitten authorization, ld., Ex. N.\n(7) Most recently, the Receiver asked DMR to mail BRI promotional\nmaterials to the guardians and parents of all consumers whose contracts for\nmental retardation services will be coming up for award in the coming\nmonths, under a cover letter drafted by the Receiver and signed by DMR's\ngeneral counsel, ld, Ex. V.\n(8) The Receiver has also intruded on the Attorney General's\nexclusive authority to represent state agencies in litigation, see DMR Br. at\n157, by directing DMR's counsel, who was acting as a special assistant\nattorney general, to withdraw objections to a stipulation entered into by the\nother parties to a substituted judgment proceeding involving a BRI student,\nMorrissey Aft., Ex. P, Q, and ordering DMR not to file objections in futur_\nProbate Court proceedings without prior notice to the Receiver. Id., Ex. R.\n(9) The Receiver is also apparently preparing to exercise his broad\npersonnel authority, since he has requested the names and home and business\naddresses of all DMR employees (not only those with some BRl-related\nresponsibilities) as well us all DMR organizational charts and policies and\nprocedures relating to employee discipline, ld., Ex. O, S.\n-51-\n\nBecause, for the reasons discussed in this brief and in the\nCommissioner's opening brief, it is likely that this Court ultimately will\nvacate the trial court's overly intrusive and unconstitutional remedial orders,\nthe Court should immediately stay those orders to prevent any further\nimpemlissible intrusion on the powers of the executive and legislative\nbranches and, more important, to obviate the very concrete risk of immediate\nand irreparable harm to other vendors, DMR employees, and the consumers\nserved by DMR.\nVI. BRI Misstates and Missapplies the Legal Standards\nApplicable to Its Application for Attorneys' Fees.\nBRI's argument in support of the trial court's award of attorneys' fees\nstarts with the mistaken premise that the amount of fees awarded by a trial\ncourt is \"presumed to be correct.\" BRI Br. at 161. In fact, no such\npresumption exists, and the scope of appellate review of fee awards is far\nmore searching than BRI suggests. Indeed, as recognized by the Appeals\nCourt in the principal case relied upon by BRI on this point, although\n\"[s]etting the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee lies largely in the\ndiscretion of the trial judge..., [t]he exercise ofdiscretiun.., is not beyond\nappellate review.\" Olmstead v. Murphy, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 664, 665 (1986)\n(citing gobbins v. Robbins, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 538 (1985), review denied, 397\nMass. 1102 (1986)). Accordingly, appellate courts do not hesitate to overturn\nfee awards where, as here, the trial court has not \"dwelt on the relevant\nconsiderations\"; has not \"stayed within permissible evidentiary bounds,\"\nRobbins, 19 Mass. App. Ct. at 543; or has not made sufficient findings to\nsupport its conclusions. Kenne@ v. Kenne@, 23 Mass. App. Ct, 176, 180\n(1986), aff'd, 400 Mass. 272, 274 (1987) (\"agree[ing] with the result and\nreasoning of the Appeals Court\"). See also DMR Br. at 164-69.\nIn particular, fee awards are properly reversed where, as here, the trial\ncourt \"count[ed] as reasonable all the hours claimed by counsel\" without\n-52-\n\nmaking its own \"independent 'objective' valuation of the services they\nrendered in fact.\" Robbins, 19 Mass. App. Ct. at 542-43; see also DMR Br.\nat 167. As further recognized in another case cited by BRI, the trial court's\nfindings are deficient where, as here, they do not demonstrate that the court\n(1) carefully scrutinized whether all of the tasks for which fees are sought are\ntruly legal, as opposed to secretarial, paralegal, or investigatory, in nature;\n(2) considered potential duplication of effort by attorneys meeting with each\nother, their clients, opposing counsel, or the court;\" and (3) \"eliminate[d] all\ntime spent on press-related matters.\" New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air &\nWater _'.Espanola Mercantile Co., 72 F.3d 830, 835 (10th Cir. 1996); see\nalso DMR Br. at 168, 173-77. _\nBRI's argument that the Commissioner is somehow estopped from\nobjecting to the trial court's impoundment of the time records underlying the\n\"Contrary to BRI's contention, BRI Br. at 165, DMR accurately stated the\nnumber of attorneys and paralegals (twanty-five) who worked on this cam on behalf\nof BRl (eighteen, App. 621-22), the parents (five, App. 623-27, 1148-52), and the\nstudents (two, App. 1131, 1173). The fact that DMR supported the individual\nstudents' motion to intervene in this case is in no way inconsistent with its\nobjections to the trialcourt's award of fees to counsel for the class of students and\nparents ortothe student members of the class, as BRI claims. BRI Br. at 165. The\nstandards forintervention are entirely different from the standards for determining\nv,'hether a party or a successful intervenor may recover attorneys' fees from an\nopposing party. Indeed, many of the cases cited by the Commissioner inopposition\ntothe fee awards to the students and parents' counsel were cases inwhich fees were\ndenied to intervenors. See DMR Br. at 174-76.\n_-Contrary to BRI's contention, BRI 8r. at 170 n.65, the Commissioner did\nraise his objections to the reasonableness of BRl's fee application in the trial court,\nto the extent possible without access tothe underlying time records. App. 700-01,\n737. BRI's further contention that the Commissioner was not prejudiced in his\nability to effectively oppose BRI's fee application by the lack of access to BRI's\ntime records, BR/Br. at 170, isalso incorrect. As recognized inthe very case cited\nby BRI on this point, a party opposing fees \"cannot merely allege in general terms\nthat the time spent was excessive.\" Bell v. United Princeton Properties, Inc., 884\nF.2d 713,720 (3d Cir. 1989). Rather, a fee opponent must \"identify with precision\"\nthose tasks on v,'hich excessive time was spent, id. a_721, which is, of course,\nimpossible without knowing how much time was spent on particular tasks.\n-53-\n\nfee awards because the Commissioner's counsel did not keep or submit\ncontemporaneous time records, BRI Br. at 167, 170, rests on the false\npremise that the Commissioner filed a fee application in this case. While a\nprayer for fees was included in the Commissioner's counterclaim, App. 504,\nthe Commissioner did not ultimately apply for fees, nor would he be entitled\nto any, given the court's total rejection of his counterclaim. App. 1322.\nIndeed, when the court directed the Commissioner's counsel to file affidavits\nas tothe amount of time spent on this case, counsel questioned the relevance\nofsuch affidavits, given thelack of any fee application by the Commissioner.\nTr. XI11:45-50. See also Real v. Continental Group, Inc,, 116 F.R.D. 21I,\n213 (N.D.Cal. 1986) (time spent by opposing counsel of only minimal\nrelevance in assessing reasonableness of time spent by fee applicant).\nBRI's attempt toovercome the Commissioner's procedural objections\ntothe trial court's impoundment of counsel's billing records, by arguing that\nthe court possessed \"inherent power\" to impound the records without\ncomplying with the Uniform Rules of Impoundment Procedure, BRI Br. at\n169, should be summarily rejected by this Court. All but one of the cases\ncited by BRI on this point predate the Uniform Rules; and the only other\ncase, Newspapers of New England v. Clerk Magistrate, 403 Mass. 628, 632\n0988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1066 (1989), upholds the court's impoundment\norder as consistent with the Uniform Rules, not \"despite\" those rules, as BR1\nstates. Moreover, even prior to the Uniform Rules, \"documents [could] only\nbe impounded on a showing of overriding necessity .... based on specific\nfindings.\" George W. Prescott Publishing Co. v. Register of Probate, 395\nMass. 274, 279 (1985).\nAlso, even if the court's impoundment order were procedurally\ncorrect, impoundment is not the appropriate means of protecting documents\nfrom release to the opposing party in a case. Rather, as provided in the\nUniform Rules, \"impoundment\" is a means of making court records\n-54-\n\n\"unavailable for public inspection\" (emphasis added), Rule 1; and even\nimpounded records are ordinarily available to the \"attorneys of record [and]\nthe parties to the case.\" Rule 9.\nBRI's half-hearted attempt to argue that the court's impoundment of\nall of counsel's billing records was \"narrowly tailored\" to protect the\nprivileged material contained therein, BRI Br. at 169, should also be rejected.\nEven the cases that BRI cites as to the privileged nature of attorneys' billing\nrecords recognize that not all of the information contained in such records is\nprivileged. E.g, Gonzales Crespo v. Wella Corp., 774 F. Supp. 688, 690 &\nn.6 (D.P.R. 1991) (amount and date of fees paid and number of hours billed,\nnot privileged). Moreover, in none of the cases cited by BRI was a fee\napplicant's billing records held to be protected by attorney/client privilege\nfi'om release to a fee opponent. In fact, in holding billing records privileged\nin a fraud case, the court expressly distinguished that situation from cases\ninvolving an application for attorneys' fees, where the court acknowledged\nthat billing records are not privileged. FTC v. Cambridge Exch, Ltd., 845 F.\nSupp. 872, 874 (S.D. Fla. 1993).\nV[L APPELLEES _ REQUESTS FOR APPELLATE COSTS AND FEES ARE\nBARRED BY SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND ARE OTHERWISE\nUNWARRANTED.\nAppellees' requests for appellate costs and attorneys' fees, pursuant\nto Mass. R. App. P. 25, and G.L.e. 211, § 10, can be quickly disposed of on\njurisdictional grounds. Even if this appeal were \"frivolous ''s_ (which it most\nSTTo the extent that BRI's requests for costs are premised on its\nunsubstantiated and unfounded allegations that the Commissioner's appellate\narguments \"take[ ] evidence out of context,\" \"misrepresent [ ]many of the facts...\nwithout proper substantiation in the record,\" and \"missappl[y] legal principles,\"\nBRI Br. at 172, BRI ispoorly situated tomake such claims, given itsown pervasive\nmisstatements of law and fact pointed out throughout the foregoing brief. Cf\nDeSisto College, Inc. v. Line, gg8 F.2d 755, 766 (I lth Cir. 1989) (upholding\nimposition of Rule 11sanctions for \"maintaining a legal stance untenable with our\n(continued...)\n-55-\n\ncertainly is not, as the foregoing arguments amply demonstrate), the Court's\n\"pov,'er to assess double costs, penalty interest, and counsel fees does not\nextend to appeals brought by the Commonwealth\" or its officials.\nSpartichino v.

Appellees' claim for such sanctions must\ntherefore be summarily denied.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the reasons discussed above and in the Commissioner's\nopening brief, the Court should (1) stay the trial court's injunctive and\nreceivership orders pending a decision by this Court and (2) reverse the\ncontempt judgment of the trial court or, in the alternative, remand this case\nfor a new trial.\nRespectfully submitted,\nSCOT1 _HARSHBARGER\nATTORNEY GENERAL\nAJ_sith S.

LAV  IGNA. Ph.D. • BCBA-D \nProfessional Background \nI, Gary W. LaVigna, do hereby depose and state as follows: \n1.  I am the Clinical Director at (and co-owner ot) the Institute for Applied \nBehavior Analysis (IABA) in Los Angeles, California. I have held that position since \n1981. In that position, my duties and responsibilities include providing clinical direction \nand oversight for almost 600 staff in their provision of a range of services to children and \nadults with intellectual disability and other disorders.  These services include Supported \nLiving, Supported Employment, Intensive Support, Early Intervention, In-home \nBehavioral Respite, Forensic, Crisis Prevention and Resolution, Training and \nConsultation Services all in support of children, adolescents and adults with challenging \nbehavior.  (\"Challenging behavior\" or \"problem behavior\" is defmed as \"culturally \nabnonnal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of \nthe person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to \nseriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities\" (Emerson, \n1 \n\n1995).) I have a Ph.D. in the fields of clinical pSychology and applied behavior analysis \nfrom the University of Chicago.  I am licensed as a clinical psychologist in California and \nI am certified as a behavior analyst by the Behavior Analysis Certification Board.  (See \nattached curriculum vitae.) \n2.  My work has included supporting people with the most severe and \nchallenging behavior (including extreme self injury and physical aggression) using \npositive behavior support, including those whose problems, in fact, could not and were \na \nnot solved using  punitive approach attempted by others.  (e.g., LaV  igna, Willis & \nDonnellan, 1989; LaVigna & Willis, 1992; and LaVigna & Willis, 2012). \nSynthesis \n3.  In the course of my career, which includes 7 years as a staff pSychologist \nat a state hospital (where the Autism unit I worked on was initially placed on the \npsychiatric side of the hospital and then was reassigned to the Developmental Disability \nside) and 4 years as clinical director of another community-based agency before forming \n!ABA 31 years ago, there has been a fundamental shift in the field of applied behaVior \nanalysis (ABA) in support of people with challenging behavior.  Based on the ethical \nrequirement that the least restrictive procedure be used consistent with effective \ntreatment, in the early days, i.e., more than 25 years ago, some practitioners would \nsometimes use two forms of punishment·t o reduce the occurrence of challenging \nbehavior.  The first of these two forms included consequences that applied aversive \nstiniuli or events such as those used at the Judge Rotenburg Center (JRC), including, but \nnot limited to, painful spanks, pinches, muscle squeezes, and more recently, contingent \n2 \n\nelectric shock.  The second of these two forms included loss of privileges and restrained \ntime out, i. e., phys~cal restraint to prevent access to anything desired, also used by JRe. \n4.  However, given the significant amount of research that has been carried \nout over the last quarter of century, starting in 1985, the field of positive behavior \nsupports (PBS), i. e., applied behavior analysis without punishment, has been firmly \nestablished. Professionals who have extensively used evidenced-based PBS over the past \n25 years have reached a consensus opinion that punitive procedures are not necessary \nand, therefore, are not ethical. \n5.  The cl~cal and empirical support for this consensus opinion is \nconsiderable and has significantly changed profession3.I standards of care when applying \nbehavior analysis in support of people with challenging behavior.  The first study of the \nefficacy of PBS was published in 1985 (Donnellan, LaVigna, Zambito & Thvedt). In \nJanuary 1987, the field and study of PBS was promising but still in its infancy.  Over\"the \npast twenty-five years, numerous studies have established the effectiveness of PBS. \n6.  In fact, some studies have shown that PBS can be effective in cases where \npunishment has failed (e.g., LaVigna, Willis & Donnellan, 1989; LaVigna & Willis, \n1992; LaVigna & Willis, 2012). \n7.  PBS that meets defined standards can solve the most serious problems, \neven ~hen they occur at a high rate, is accessible to those who need it and is cost \neffective for fimding agencies.  (See Appendix A for an exru::nple of defined standards for \nevaluating a behavioral assessment and associated behavior support plan.  These \nstandards have been evaluated as clinically valid and have been used in various research \n3 \n\nstudies (e.g., Ballmaier, 1992; LaVigna, Christian & Willis, 2005; and Crates & Spicer, \n2012).) \n.  8.  There has not been a single peer reviewed research study to show that \npunitive strategies have been necessary when PBS has been tried and meets objectively \ndefined (current) standards (of care) .. \n9.  Accordingly, unlike the professional opinion that may have prevailed in \nthe mid 1980~ s, the use of punishment is now considered professionally unnecessary and \ninappropriate. Behavior analysts are ethically bound to use the least restrictive methods \nconsistent with effective treatment \nIntroduction \n10.  While there is a long history of debate in the field of ABA about whether \nor not there is a proper role for punishment in the support of people with challenging \nbehavior,  there  is  universal  agreement  that  the  behavior  analyst  has  the  ethical \nresponsibility  to  recommend  and  use  the  least  restrictive  methods  consistent  with \neffective treatment (http://bacb.com/; http://www.abainternational.or~VanHouten.et \nal., 1988). \n11.  A fundamental principle in behavior analysis is that the behavior analyst \nrecommends reinforcement rather than punishment whenever possible.  In other words, \nthe behavior analyst recommends the least restrictive form of treatment that will be \neffective.  Given this ethical principle, there are still those who maintain that punishment \nis sometimes necessary.  In asserting this position, articles (e.g., Lerman &  Vorndran, \n2002) have cited literature from the 1990's (e.g., Grace et al., 1994; Hagopian, 1998; \n4 \n\nWacker et al., 1990).  Such reliance makes this position dated since it does not take into. \naccount the research trends and findings in the area of positive behavior support over the \nlast nearly two decades.  See LaVigna and Willis (2012) for a recent literature review of \ndevelopments in PBS. \n12.  PBS, as it has developed over the lastquarter-:century, includes the trends \nand strategies outlined below.  Punitive 'procedures, also  known as \"punishment\" or \n\"aversives\" or \"aversive interventions,\"  can take  a  variety  of forms.  In the  1986 \n\"Settlement Agreement,\" entered into by the Behavioral Research Institute (\"BRI\"), \nwhich now operates as JRC, and the Massachusetts Office for Children, certain types of \n''physical aversive procedures\" are listed.  At the time of the Settlement Agreement, the \ntypes of procedures JRC used included:  \"spanks, pinches and muscle squeezes, and the \nrestrained time-out.\"  See Settlement Agreement at ~ A3, pp. 2-3.  At the time of the \nSettlement Agreement, these listed ''physical aversive procedures\" were \"considered the ' \nmost intrusive, most restrictive fonns of treatment.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Also, as BRI \nexplained in its Second Amended Complaint in this action ''BRI has also employed \ncertain aversive techniques since its inception.  The aversive techniques employed by \nBRI to  decrease  its  students'  aggressiveness  and  self-destructiveness  consist  of the \napplication of stimulation that BRI students will seek to avoid, such as water sprays, taste \naversives and muscle squeezes.  When necessary, these aversive techniques are used in \nconjunction with mecruinical restraints.  BRI employs these punitive, aversive techniques \nnot as a punishment, but as p'art of a systematic behavior modification program.  BRI \nemploys these techniques in lieu of anti-psychotic medication and other more restrictive \n5 \n\nprocedures such as seclusion and electroshock.\"  Second Amended Complaint at, 16 \n(emphasis added). \n13.  Instead of the procedures listed in the 1986 Settlement Agreement or the \nSecond Amended Complaint, it is my understanding that JRC now uses contingent skin \nshock as one of, if not its primary, aversive technique.  I understand, based in part on a \n\"OED Electronics Report\" generated in November 2009 by Bay Computer Associates for \nJRC, that JRC now uses two contingent skin shock devices - the OED and the OED-4. \nAccording to this November 2009 report, the OED delivers a shock with a \"nominal \nvoltage of 12.0 Volts\" and that the OED-4 delivers a shock with a \"nominal voltage of \n22.2 VoltS.\"  Contingent skin shock, in general, is more intrusive and more restrictive \nthan the procedures JRC used at the time of the Settlement Agreement.  Based on the \nvoltage of shock administered, the GED-4 is more intrusive and restrictive than the GED. \n14.  Contingent  skin  shock  is  a  much  more  intrusive  and  restrictive \nintervention than any of the interventions listed in the Second Amended Complaint or by \nthe parties in the Settlement Agreement. \n15.  There  is  near-universal  agreement  that  contingent  skin  shock  is \nprofessionally unnecessary and inappropriate because there are other, far less restrictive \nmethods available to treat challenging behaviors, as detailed below. \nIDstorical Trends \n16.  There have been a number of themes embedded in the research trends that \nhave  established  positive  behavior  supports  as  ABA  in  support  of people  with \nchallenging behavior. These trends are rooted in the broad range of outcomes established \n6 \n\na \nin the  field  for  behavior  support plan.  These  outcomes,  which are  metrics  for \nmeasuring progress, include not only the rapid reduction of the occurrence and episodic \nseverity of the challenging behavior itself (meaning that the challenging behavior occurs \nless frequently and is less serve when it does occur), but also the generalization and \ndurability of these gains in settingS beyond the treatment setting (meaning that progress \ntoward positive outcomes can be replicated outside of the treatment setting), minimizing \nnegative side effects, assuring acceptability to the service recipient regarding the plan's \nobjectives and methods, and improvement in the focus person's overall quality of life as \nmeasured by socially valued outcomes (Favell, et al., 1982).  The literature demonstrates \nthat, when using these generally accepted outcome measures for any behavioral support \nplan, PBS is effective in the treatment of even the most challenging behaviors. \nTrend #1:  Move· from  Experimental Research with Animals to Applied \nResearch with People \n17.  One trend in the research associated with this broad range of outcomes has \nbeen a move away from basic research us~g animals as subjects to applied research with \npeople,  since acceptability and  improved quality  of life  are not applicable outcome \nmeasures with animals. \n18.  One example of how the literature on punishment fails to account for this \ntrend is Lerman and Vorndran (2002), in which the authors reviewed more than three \ndozen experimental and/or animal studies in support of using punishment in supporting \npeople with challenging behavior.  One of these references (Van Houten, 1983) explicitly \nties  the  use  of punishment  to  the  \"animal  laboratory,\"  as  indicated  in  the  title \n\"Punishment: from the animal laboratory to the applied setting. \" \n7 \n\nj \n19.  In  contrast,  the  research  of the  past  25  years  contributing  to  the \ndevelopment of positive behavior plans in support of people with 'chall~ing behavior \ncites virtually exclusively applied research with people; the PBS literature of the last \nquarter century does not rely on the animal studies.  The Qistinction is critical because \nanimal studies are largely inapplicable when considering the broader context of all the \nrequired outcomes for people (e.g., Carr, et al., 2002; LaVigna & Willis, 2005a; 2012) . \n..... \nTrend #2:  Move from Behavior Support Plans with Isolated Strategies to \n, .  Behavior Support Plans with a Fully Defined Structure  . \n20.  Over the past twenty-five years, there has been growing awareness that \nbehavior support plans muSt be comprised of multiple procedures.  Multiple procedures \nare used to address and designed to achieve a variety of desired outcomes.  By contrast, \none procedure alone does not produce broad range of desired outcomes. \n21.  Ibis trend was anticipated in Alternatives to  Punishment (LaVigna & \nDonnellan, 1986), in which hundreds of research studies of isolated (positive) strategies \nwere reviewed.  In a concluding chapter, we acknowledged that the desired effects, \nincluding the direct effects on the challengiilg behavior, may require \"additive,\" i.e., \nmultiple strategies. \n22.  lbis recognition has evolved into a  defined  set of standards,  defined \nbelow, for the strategies t!mt a behavior support plan needs to include when less inchisive \nplans have not been effective (e.g., Carr, et al., 2002; LaVigna & Willis, 200580 2012; \nLaV  igna, Christian & Willis, 2005).  A minimum of one procedure, if not more than one, \nwould be included under each strategic heading in a full multi-element plan: \n8 \nI \n\nStrategy #1: Ecological Strategies \n23.  Challenging behaviors are often, at least partly, a function of a mismatch \nbetween the person's needs and characteristics and the physical, interpersonal, and/or \nservice environments.  Fully developed positive behavior support plans include strategies \nfor  \"smoothing  the  fit\"  by  eliminating  these  mismatches.  Some  examples  of \nenviromnental changes include: \n•  the physical environment may need to be altered by reducing the amount of \nnoise and/or crowding; \nthe  interpersonal  environment  may  reqUIre  staff  to  interact  using  a \n\"prescriptive\" style (Le.,  as described in an \"interaction style\" procedural \nprotocol) rather than their natural style of interaction.  An example of this \nwould be a protocol which prescribed, among other things, a specific script to \nfollow when needing to deny access to something the person may want or be \nasking for, in order to minimize the likelihood of triggering a episode of the \nchallenging behavior; \nthe interpersonal environment may need to have staff assigned who are fluent \nin the communication system (for example, sign language) or language (for \nexample, Spanish) used by the focus person; \nthe service environment may need to have a richer staffing ratio; \n•  the service environment may require the benefit of different teaching methods, \nfor  example,  \"discrete  trial  teaching\"  (a very  structured  method  which \nremoves  all  irrelevant  stimuli  that  may  distract  the  student)  or  \"direct \n9 \n\ninstruction\" (which uses lectures and/or demonstrations) as opposed to least to \nmost \"correction prompting\" (which can lead to a dependence on prompts \nfrom the teacher) (Donnellan, LaVigna, Negri-Shoultz, & Fassbender, 1988). \n24.  Such environmental changes are. often aimed at directly improving the \nperson's quality of life. but may also represent \"establishing operations\" (Michael, 1993) \nthat reduce the likelihood of the challenging behavior.  (\"Establishing operations\" are \nsetting events that can occur minutes, hours, days or even longer before a behavior that \nmay increase or decrease a person's reactivity to an antecedent to a behavior or increase a \nperson's motivation to achieve or avoid a consequence for a behavior.)  Further, for both \nof these reasons, (both contributing to a high quality of life and maintaining a setting \nevent that is likely to be associated with the lower likeI~ood of challenging behavior), \ncertain changes will have to be maintained even after the behavior challenge is brought \nunder control in order to-maintain the desired treatment outcomes.  For example, if our \necological strategies included making sure that the person spent his days with people who \nunderstand sign language given that he is deaf and that sign language is his main means \nof communication, even after his challenging behavior is solved, he will still need to be \nwith people who understand and who can use sign language. \nStrategy #2: Positive Programming Strategies \n25.  It is  fundamental  to ABA  that a  behavior  support plan includes  the \nteaching of new skills to expand the focus person's behavioral repertoire (Goldiamond, \n1974; 1975).  In multi-element planning, these are referred to as ''positive programs\" and \neach recommendation for a positive program includes a specific instructional objective \n'and a specific instructional method.  There are four specific skill c~tegories that should be \n10 \n\nincluded in a  fully  developed,  positive,  multi-element  support·p lan:  general  skills, \nfunctionally equivalent skills, functionally related skills, and coping and tolerance skills. \n26.  General skills include self-care, domestic, community, recreational, and \nacademic skills.  It is likely that the larger the behavioral repertoire under the person's \ncommand, the lower the likelihood that challenging behavior will occur (Goldiamond, \n1974; 1975).  Further, to the extent that (at least some of) these skills will give the person \ndirect access to reinforcing activities, items or events (for example, the ability to cook a \nhQmemade pizza, or to access their favorite TV show without staff or parent assistance or \nparticipation) these reinforcers will compete with the 'reinforcers that are motivating the \n·challenging behavior. \n27.  FunctionaUy equivalent skills rest on the premise that whans referred to \nas challenging behavior always serve a legitimate function; put another way, that the \nchallenging behavior meets a particular need for the individual (e.g., a need or desire for \nsomething to eat or drink or the need to escape an aversive environment or activity). The \nrationale for including functionally equivalent skills in a multi-element support plan is to \nteach the focus person a more socially acceptable way of getting that need met.  One \nmajor strategy for doing this to teach the person how to communicate the message they \nare communicating through their challenging behavior in a more socially acceptable way. \n'Ibis is referred to in the literature as functional communication training (Carr & Durand, \n1985) .. An example would be teaching the person how to communicate \"no\" or \"I don't \nunderstand\" or \"I don't know how\" or \"I want  .\"  While functional communication \ntraining represents one way to teach a functionally equivalent skill, it is not the only way \nto do so.  For example, someone may engage in PICA behavior (i.e., dangerously eating \n11 \n\ninedible  objects)  when they are hungry in order to  access something to ingest.  A \nfunctionally equivalent skill could be for the person to be able to communicate their \nhunger to another person.  Alternatively, the person could be taught, whenever they are \nhungry, to independently (without staff or parent presence or participation) go to the \nkitchen, open the refrigerator door, and access the yogurt, veggie sticks. or :fresh fruit that \nhas been placed there for just that purpose. \n28.  Functionally  related  skills  do  not  serve  the  same  -function  as  the \nchallenging behavior or the functionally equivalent skill but are related to that function. \nFor example, we may be teaching the person to independently access a  snack or to \nprepare one to meet bunger/need to ingest motivated behavior, but a skill related to this is \nto be able to discriminate between edible and inedible items.  If this skill is' missing from \nthe person's repertoire, it will be necessary to teach it.  -Further examples might include \nteaching the person to follow an explicit rule, teaching the person when, where and under \nwhat circumstances it is acceptable to engage in the behavior, how to make choices \n(increasing the choices available would go under the heading of ecological strategies), \nand how to use a visual schedule to predict what is going to happen (introducing a visual \nschedule would also go under the beading of ecological strategies). \n29.  Coping and tolerance skills are, technically, functionally related skills \nsince they are aimed at giving the focus person the ability to cope with and tolerate the \ntypical antecedents associated with the higher likelihood of the challenging behavior but \nto be able to do that without exhibiting the behavior.  These skills are so important for \ndurable outcomes that, although they are functionally related, they justify a category of \ntheir own.  To say it another way, these skills allow the person to cope with and tolerate \n12 \n\nthe naturally occurring adverse events that are part of life but that, for the focus person, \nincrease the likelihood of the challenging behavior.  Examples of antecedents that may \nincrease the likelihood of challenging behavior but which are part of life include being \ntold you have to wait for something you want, being told you can't have something you \nwant, having to do something you don't want to do, beingtoo hot, being too cold, etc. \nUnfortunately, the list of naturally occuning adverse events. is a long, perhaps unending, \nlist.  Ironically, the more successful we are in helping the people we support live a typical \nlife, the more we assure that they will come into contact with these realities.  To the \nextent that the realities are associated with a higher likelihood of challenging behavior, \nour plans need to include positive programs teaching them how to cope with and tolerate \nthese events in more socially acceptable ways. \nStrater\" #3: Focused Sw;pon Strategies \n30.  It will take a while to \"smooth the fif' in the ecological mismatches that \nare identified.  It will take a while to teach the skills that are identified for the positive \nprograms that make up the multi-element plan.  Accordingly, focused support strategies \nare also  included in order to prevent occurrences of the challenging behavior to the \ngreatest extent possible.  That is, in the multi-element model, the definition and role of a \nfocused support strategy is to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the need for a reactive \nstrategy by reducing the occurrence of the challenging behavior.  Perhaps one of the most \neffective focused support strategies is antecedent control (LaVigna & Donnellan, 1986; \nLuiselli & Cameron, 1998).  While ecological and positive programming strategies are \naimed  at  long-tenn  and  permanent  outcomes,  focused  support,  i.e.,  preventative \n13 \n\nstrategies, are aimed toward the more immediate goal of reducing if not eliminating the \noccurrence of the challenging behavior. \n31.  Anteced.ettt control is inherently superior to punishment as a rapid control \nstrategy as it is a before-the-fact procedure that may preclude the occurrence of the \nchallenging behavior, while punishment is an after-the-fact procedure that requires the \noccurrence of the challenging behavior. \n32.  There are two major variations to antecedent control.  The fIrst involves \nremoving  the  antecedents  associated  with the  higher  likelihood  of the  challenging \nbehavior.  For example, this may mean not asking or requiring the person to do those \nthings they do not want to do.  The second involves introducing antecedents associated \nwith the lower likelihood.ofthe behavior.  For example, this may require the provision of \nan exceptionally :frequent schedule for the delivery of the person's preferred events based \non the clock and calendar rather than being based on behavior.  In both cases, such \nantecedent control strategies would be paired with positive programs aimed at teaching \nskills for coping with and tolerating the naturally occurring antecedents, e.g., the need to \nperform an important but non-preferred activity or the need to tolerate a more typical \nschedule of preferred events. \n33.  Another whole category of possible focused support strategies involves \ncertain schedules of reinforcement.  For example, one particularly useful schedule is the \ndifferential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO).  In this schedule the criterion for \nreinforcement is the non-occurrence of the target behavior for a specified period of time, \nregardless of what else the person does or doesn't do.  In fact, one of the more powerful \nvariations of this schedule is the differential reinforcement of other behavior with a \n14 \n\nprogressively increased amount of reinforcement available for each consecutive interval \nduring which the target behavior does not occur (DROP), up to a specified maximum \n(LaV  igna & Donnellan, 1986).  In fact, with a clear and concrete enough explanation of \nthe  reinforcement  contingency,  and  with  the  use  of a  significant  magnitude  of \nreinforcement,  such schedules can also preclude the occurrence of target behavior as \nbehavior can be rule-governed as well as contingency-governed (Hayes, 1989).  That is, \ntelling someone how they can earn a reinforcer can lead to a direct and iriunediate change \nin behavior before the person even experiences earning the reinforcer. \n34.  . For example, I had the opportunity to work with a 17-year old girl with \nAspergers Syndrome upon her discharge from a locked psychiatric hospital.  She was \ngoing home since no residential school would accept her given the seriousness of her \nchallenging behavior.  Specifically, she would run away from her home (and bad even \nrun away from the psychiatric hospital).  It would sometimes take up to a week for her to \nbe found and broUght back home.  While gone, she would engage in promiscuous sex \nwith homeless men and any other men who would accept her invitation.  This behavior \nwas justifiably considered to be life threatening, since she could have ended up with a \nviolent male or she could have contracted a fatal sexually transmitted disease.  (It may be \nworth mentioning here that from its roots [Donnellan, et aI.,  1985] and throughout its \nhistory to the present [LaVigna & Willis, 2012], PBS has proven effective regardless of \nthe  person's  diagnosis  or functioning  level,  including  severe  and  profound mental \nretardation.) \n35.  To  simplify  it,  the  comprehensive  functional  assessment for  this  girl \nconcluded that this behavior was motivated by her desperate desire to interact socially \n15 \n\nwith others and reflected her marked inability and frustration in her struggle to meet these \ncritical needs.  Based on this conclusion, a full multi-element PBS plan was developed \nand  implemented,  but the  critical piece was the  focused  support strategy that was \nincluded to prevent her from running away. \n36.  This involved a progressive DRO (DROP) schedule of reinforcement in \nwhich she could eam anywhere from 1 - 10 exchangeable tokens, depending on how \nmany consecutive days she had gone without running away.  1bat is, she could earn one \ntoken for the first day she did not run away, two for the second day in a row, three for the \nthird, up to ten tokens for the tenth consecutive day and then 10 tokens for every \n, \n, \nconsecutive day thereafter.  Whenever she had accumulated 300 tokens (which she would \nultimately be able to do once a month), she was able to turn those in for a grab in the grab \nbag.  There were always five wrapped gifts in the grab bag, for example, articles of \nclothing, gift certificates to the movies, etc.  However, in every grab bag, one of the \nwrapped gifts was a $100 bill.  This was what she really was hoping for since she had a \nvery strong desire to shop in various thrift stores and charity shops to buy articles of \nclothing.  Her allowance simply did not give her the money she very much wanted.  This \nschedule was affordable to her family as she, at most, would get one \"grab\" a month, and \non average, pick the $100 bill one out offive times (for an average monthly cost of $20). \nCognitively, she was able to understand this schedule of reinforcement and with its \nimplementation she stopped running away immediately.  This kept her safe, allowing the \nrest of the PBS plan to be implemented leading to the entire range of outcomes desired, \nincluding teaching her safe ways of getting her socialization and relationship needs met \n1& \n\n37.  Similar methods have proven effective  for people with less cognitive \nability. For example, in LaVigna & Willis, 1992,  we effectively used PBS to support a \nperson with severe self injurious behavior.  This -person was diagnosed with Autism and \nwas also deaf due to maternal rubella and was considered to have a very low level of \nfunctional skills.  He had been treated by another' agency using extremely punitive \nprocedures  (e.g.,  bare  bottomed  smacks)  without  success.  After a  comprehensive \nfunctional assessment, a full PBS plan was developed and implemented successfully.  . \n38.  In addition to DRO and its variations, Other schedules of reinforcement, \nfor example, the differential reiDforcement of alternative responses or the differential \nreinforcement of low rates of responding can also be used as focused support strategies as \nwell as other procedures such as stimulus satiation which involves giving the person \ngreater than  even wanted,  free  access to the reinforcer maintaining the challenging \nbehavior (LaV  igna & Donnellan, 1986), for example, free acCess to a fruit bowl to satisfy \none's desire for food. \nStrategy #4: Reactive Strategia \n39.  Fully  developed  multi~element, positive  behavior  support 'plans  also \ninclude reactive strategies.  In such plans, the role of a reactive strategy is not to teach a \nlesson or to reduce the future  occurrence of the behavior, as would be the role of \npunishment.  In the full multi-element approach, the responsibility for future effects is \nassigned  to  the  proactive  ecological,  positive  programming  and  focused  support \nstrategies. \n40.  The role of the reactive strategy is narrow but important, i.e., to get the \nquickest, safest control over the behavior (LaVigna & Willis, 2005b).  Rapid and safe \n17 \n\nsituational management may be accomplished through such strategies as:  (a) ignoring the \nchallenging behavior, that is, continuing with what you were doing as if the behavior has \nnot occurred,  knowing you will naturally redirect the person back to the scheduled \nactivity;  (b)  explicitly  redirecting the  person to  the  activity  at  hand;  (c)  providing \ninformational  feedback  to the person,  for  example,  reminding  them what they  are \nworking toward; (d) prompting a preferable response (for example, prompting the use of \nthe functionally equivalent skill being taught through positive programming); (e) active \nlistening; and (t) stimulus change. \n41.  In cases of particularly severe behaviors and/or in cases where t:b-e reactive \nstrategies listed above have not worked, it may also be necessary to use what are referred \nto as \"counter-intuitive strategies\" (LaVigna & Willis, 2002).  They are called counter\" \nintuitive because, at first glance, they would appear to be strategies that would reinforce \nthe target behavior.  Counter-intuitive reactive strategies include getting rapid and safe \ncontrol over the target behavior by redirecting the person to a preferred event or activity \nor, even, capitulating as a way of getting the dangerous behavior to stop, that is, giving \nthe person what he wants or allowing the person to escape the current demand, if that is \nwhat he wants. \n42.  There is certainly an intuitive element to such strategies, ie., it is very \nlikely that access to a strongly preferred event or activity or being allowed to escape an \nunwanted event or activity will interrupt a behavioral episode.  The counter-intuitive \nelement  is  that  such  strategies  would  appear  to  set  the  target  behavior  up  for \nreinforcement, making it more likely to occur under similar circumstances in the future. \nHowever, behaviors that are followed by preferred events are not always reinforced by \n18 \n\nthose events.  Preventing reinforcement from occurring under thes,? circumstances can be \nunderstood within the full context of non-linear ABA (Goldiamond & Thompson, 1967, \nreprinted in 2004).  For example, non-contingent access to the preferred event being used \n(as part of the proactive plan) and a DROP schedule aimed at the target behavior are \namong the non-linear establishing operations, i.e., setting events as described above, that \ncan prevent reinforcement from  occurring.  (The phrase non-linear is used to make \nexplicit that the understanding of behavior using ABA goes beyond simply understanding \nthe A-B-C's (antecedents, behavior, consequences).  History, setting events, rules, and \nother factors also need to be fully considered.) \nTrend #3:  Move to Additional Measures. Principles and Procedures \n43.  While the severity of challenging behavior has always been a focus in \nABA (Favell, et aI., 1982), changes in severity have not typically been measured in either \nbasic or applied research.  In 2005, episodic severity was introduced to the field of ABA \nas an outcome measure (LaV  igna & Willis 2005b). \n44.  Episodic severity is defined as the quantified measure of the intenSity or \ngravity of each behavioral incident, summarized by calculating both the average level·o f \nseverity and range of severity over a specified period of time, based on the quantified \nmeasure of severity selected.  The objective is to have a reduction in episodic severity \nmeasured as one of the outcomes in a behavior support plan. \n45.  In a multi-element positive behavior support plan, the responsibility for \nreducing the episodic severity of the target behavior is assigned to the reactive strategies. \n46.  For example, the episodic severity of tantrum behavior might be m~ \nby the duration (in minutes) of each tantrum that occurs, with the behavior support plan \n19 \n\nbeing responsible fot reducing the average duration and the top of the range over the \nspecified period of time.  The episodic severity of each incident of physical aggression or \nself injury might be measured by a five point scale, with level five being the measUre of \nepisodic severity when the incident results in the need for someone to receive medical \ntreatment, level four being the measure if fIrst aid is required (but not medical treatment), \nlevel three if there is resulting redness and/or bruising (but not the need for medical \nFor \ntreatment or first aid), and so on.  example, in such a case, if during the initial week \nofp lan implementation, the average level of episodic severity was 3.5, with a range of \nfrom 1 to 5, but after 4 weeks of implementation, the average level was 1.8, with a range \noffrom 1 to 3, we would consider this to represent considerable improvement. \n47.  The introduction of episodic severity as a new dependent variable (i. e. • \noutcome measure) for ABA in support of people with challenging behavior also required \nthe introduction ofn ew principles and procedures because reactive strategies in the multi-\nelement model are measured by their situational effects whereas the traditional principles \nand procedures of ABA are defined by their future effects. \n48.  Resolution and Escahltion are two of these new principles (LaV  igna & \nWillis, 2005b). \n49.  Resolution is defined as the reactive presentation or withdrawal of a \nstimulus or event that results in the immediate reduction of the likelihood of response \ncontinuation or escalation. \n50.  In contrast, escalation is defined as the reactive presentation or withdrawal \nof a stimulus or event that results in an increase in the immediate probability. of response \ncontinuation or escalation. \n20 \n\n51.  When  developing  a  multi-element  behavior  support  plan,  with  the \navailability and use of the new outcome measure of episodic severity and with the new \nprinciples and procedures of resolution and escalation at hand, we can explicitly take \nresponsibility for recommending reactive strategies, or for that matter, consequences, that \nresult in resolution (reductions in episodic severity), rather than escalation (increases in \nepisodic severity). \nTrend #4:  Move  from  Functional  Analysis  Alone  to  an Emphasis  on \nFunctional Assessment \n52.  It is generally agreed upon that understanding the variables that control \nchallenging behavior can be essential in developing an effective behavior support plan. \nA formal, if limited, method for perfonning a \"functional analysis\" has been amply \ndescribed in the ABA literature (e.g.,  Iwata, et al.,  1982; Hanley, Iwata &  McCord, \n2003).  In order to  identify the complex variables that may  be contributing to the \nbehavior,  however,  the  full  multi-element  approach,  and,  for  that  matter,  positive \nbehavior support in general, relies more typically on the \"functional assessment\"  of the \nbehavior as described by Kanfer and Saslow (1969) and Schwartz, Goldiamond and \nHowe (1975). \n53.  With this functional assessment approach, the possible contributing factors \nof certain  historical  setting  events,  organismic  variables ·( e.g.,  certain  neurological \nimpairments such as poor impulse control), behavioral skills repertoire and other factors \nthat are not identified through a functional analysis alone can be identified to further \nempower a full multi-element support plan. \n54.  For example, we had a client once whose extreme challenging behavior \nwas primarily triggered when she was required to go somewhere in a car.  She did not \n21 \n\nwant to get into the car.  Based on a functional analysis, this woUld be understood in \noperant terms  as ''task avoidance'· behavior.  However,  as  a  result of\" a  functional \nasse.ssment, we learned that she had been sexually abused as a child by her father in the \nfamily car.  Accordingly, her behavioral support plan included providing counseling and \ntherapy to help her deal with this traumatic childhood experience and her behavior \nchallenges were solved with a strictly positive plan.  (The lack of such therapy and \ncounseling could be understood as an ecological mismatch with reference to the service \nenvironment.)  Within months she was confidently and without resistance willing and \nable to go to various places in a car. \n55.  Using punishment because this individual refused to get into the car would \nnot have been ethical.  Nor would it be ethical to use punishment if a person's physical \naggression were due to a psychomotor seizure, that is, due to a neurological event. \nReview of Specific Research That Meets Defined Criteria. \n56.  The above sections describe a multi-element model for providing positive \nbehavioral  support  for  people  who  exhibit  seriously  challenging  behavior  without \nneeding to resort to the use of punisbment techniques.  Positive behavior support is ABA \nin support of people with challenging behavior.  It is aimed at producing the broad range \nof outcomes prescribed by ABA in support of people with such challenges. \n57.  There have been challenges raised as to the efficacy and usefulness of PBS \nin a number of ways (Foxx, 2005; Johnston et al., 2006).  These have included the \nassertion that PBS is not effective with really serious challenging behavior, it is not \neffective  with high  rate  behavior,  it  is  not  effective  in institutional  settings,  it is \n22 \n\nprohibitively expensive, and it is not accessible to most who would need it because to \nmeet the rigorously defined criteria requires highly trained specialists that would not be \navailable to most people. \n58.  In fact, the standards of care defined above are measurable.  (For eXample, \nsee  the  evaluation  instrument  attached to  this  affidavit.)  Recently,  the  Journal  of \nIntellectual and Developmental Disability (JIDD) published a series of articles reporting \nresearch on the efficacy of positive behavior support.  One of these articles provided a \nliterature review (LaVigna &  Willis, 2012) of the published research addressing the \nquestions that have been raised regarding PBS.  lbree other articles published as a part of \nthis series added to this literature (Crates &  Spicer, 2012; McClean &  Grey, 2012a; \n20 12b).  To be included in the literature review or as a study in this series, the standards \nof care described above needed to  have been met.  Excluded were any studies that \naddressed behavior challenges that would not be considered particularly  severe, for \nexample, non-compliance, and studies that may have been self-described as positive but \nwhich,  in  fact,  included  punitive  strategies.  The  studies  included  control  group \ncomparison studies, multiple baseli.'le across subjects studies, and Type 3 case studies \nthat met Kazdin's (1981) criteria allowing the drawing of valid inferences (for example, \ncase studies that included continuous data collection through baseline, intervention and \nfollow-up  and  that  involved  subjects  with  different  diagnoses  exhibiting  different \nbehaviors that are typically resistant to change.) \n59.  All told, there were 15 studies (12 summarized in the literature review and \n3 additional studies published as part of the 'special JIDD series).  In fact, some of the \ncases included those for whom a punitive approach had. previously been tried and failed. \n2l \n\nThese 15  studies reported the results for over 500 cases.  The findings  support the \nconclusions that:  (1) PBS is effective with the most severe (as well as the less severe) \nbehavior challenges; (2) PBS is effective with high rate (as well as low rate) behavior \nchallenges; (3) PBS can be used effectively in institutional as well as community settings; \n(4) PBS is cost effective; and (5) PBS is easily disseminable and accessible to those who \nneed it. \n60.  Given the ethical principle of using the least restrictive methods, these \nfindings have important implications for practitioners in the field.  If a practitioner were \nto argue that the positive approach was tried and failed, thereby justifYing the use of \npunitive procedures, the burden of proof should include a clear demonstration that those \nattempts  to  solve  the  problem  using  positive  strategies  met the  standards  of care \ndescribed above, including the performance of a comprehensive functional assessment \nand the implementation of a fully developed multi-element plan.  This standard is not \nalways met in the field (e.g., Salvy, et al., 2004). \n24 \n\nConclusion \n61.  In conclusion, when positive behavior supports meet certain standards of \ncare,  punishment  is  not necessary.  Given  the  fundamental,  guiding  principle  that \neffective treatment must be  accomplished  by  the  least restrictive  means  necessary, \npunisbment cannot be justified,.  ~shmerit is inherently more intrusive than PBS.  The \nevidence of the past twenty-five years has demonstrated the efficacy of PBS in treating \nindividuals with intellectual  and  developmental  disabilities  who  exhibit  challenging \nbehaviors.  PBS has reached the point where it is the generally accepted standard of care \nin the relevant treatment community.  Accordingly,  regulating bodies, human rights \ncommittees, and funding agencies have not just the right but.the obligation to restrict and \nregulate  against the use of punishment.  Punishment is unnecessary,  and is not the \naccepted standard of care in the relevant treatment community. \nSigned under the pains and penalties of perjury this 6th day of February, 2013. \n25 \n\nCOMMONWEALTII OF MASSACHUSEtTS \nBiUSTOL, S8  PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT \nDEPARTMENT  . . \nNO; 86E-0018-GI \niUDGE ROTENBERG EDUCATIONAL \nCENTER, INC., et aI., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nCOMMISSIONERS of the DEPARTMENT OF \nDEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ~d the ' . \nCDAEPRAER, TMENT OF EAR-L.Y  EDUCAT.I ON. .A.

On or arQund December 29; 1988, upon DMH's motion, the BriStol County \nProbate Court amended the Settlement AgrecmI~t to make;: this cIinlCal review \nrequirement  discretionary,  rather  than  mandatory,  due· primarily  to  the \nchallenges presented to DMH in r~tafu.ing clinicians to perform such reviews. \n33.~n th,e Department later assumed this obligation and after the-imposition of \nthe receivetship~ it retafued independent. clinicians, i.e. clinicians not employed \nby the Department. to perform this function. \n34.  During the receivership, withtbeapproval of the Receiver and )Re, and as a \ncondition that the Receiver imposed for Level III certification, DDS ~ed the \nindependent  clinicians  to  begin  reviewing  behavior  treatment  plags  for \nJRe \nindividui:tls who. had. been at  for over three years. rather than. ·at the time of \nadmission.

JRG submitted a new application for cerUfiC$io.n of it$ Level III pwgram on or \nabout  October  2008.  1 agam.appointed  a  Level  III  Certification  Team. \nCQnsisting of: Dr. Levendusky;  Dr. Mikkelson; Dr.  Charlot; Thomas Anzer; \nBruce LaFlamme,; and Andrea Maislen.  At the request of :,Re, an attempt was  . \nmade to. add an expert in applied behavior analysis to the Certification Team. \nDr. Michael' Cam~on was eJ:lgaged.  however.  he ultimately was  unable to \nparticipate as a member of the ~.  . \n71.  The 2008-2Q09 Certifi~ation Team revie~, a sample of nineteen individuals \nand tliefr behavior treatment programs at JRe, revieweddocumen.ts. at JRC. \njntervi~wed staff and Glinicians, and 'observed individuals on site. This Team' \nconcluded that the cond,itions ~posed by ~e 2006-2007 TeaID. had not been \ncomplied with; therefore in May, 2009, I issued JRe-a six\"IIlonth certification \nwiu. condi.tions. After another monitoring review, again based upon theTeam's \nReport, I issued a second six-month certification on October 2; 2009.  At tl;tat \ntime.  the  Team  commended JRC for  its  ''progress~' in certain  areas,  but \nrecominended a perlod of close oversight to ensure that JRe continued to make \n. progress in complia11ce.  . \n72.  Although it was my experience as. both a commissioner and·c ourt monitor·t hat \nfailure to substantially comply with imposed cOnditions of Certification would \nordinarily ~t in a doo.eitifi~tion. given the ,extensive history oflitigation and \nreceivership, and in the exercise of \"good faith,\" I extended JRC!s Level III \n14 \n\ncertification ~eral times to allow them a,dditional time to comply with the \nconditions .. \n73.  JRe submitre.d aD(~tI;ter Level iIi Certification application on October 30~2009. \nThe·same Level m Team ~asked to review this appli~on and on 1uly 12. \n2010, :3fter reviewing the Team's Certification Report, I issued the RepOrt and \nsent it to mc, certifYing JRC for 60 days. See Report of the Certification Team \non the Application of the Judge Rotenberg Educational Cen,ter 'for Level HI \nBehavior Modification Certifi~tion, ,uly 12,2010. (2010 Report).  (A copy of \nthis Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 6.) \n74.  After reviewing sample plans submitted by JRe, the Team again identified eight \nConditions With which JRe 4ad to c;omply to remain .~rtifled to administer \nLevel  ill interventions.  .O  nce  again, primary issues  of cOncern  wer~: the \ngrouping together ofnon-Hke ~baviors in categories to be targeted with. Level \nm \ninterventions; use of Level III interventionS to treat minor behaviors·; content \nof the functional behavioral cuWyses, including failure to address contextual \nfactors in behavior; and the failure·t o teach \"replacement behaviors.\" \n75.  JRC was required to submit a progress report concertiing its compliance With \nthese  Conditions  withitt  45  days,  and  every 45  days thereafter until  fully \ncompliant.  IRe's certification was extended 60 days to allow thein to do so. \nOn ,Au~ 9. 2010,IRC submitted its response, tit1~ \"JRC's Cotrective Action \nPIan and·Response to the DDS LeVel ill Certification Report of July 12, 2010. \nA copy of this response is attached hereto as Exhibit 14. \n76.

JRe submitted a new application for certification of its Level mp rogram on or \nabout  September 4\"  2012.  In its application,  as- in prior applications  and \nresponses to the Level ill certification reports issued by the Department, JRC \nasserted  fuiI  'compliance with the Department's regulations as well as the \nSettlement Agreement, and reserved its rights under the Settlement Agreement. \nI again apPointed a Level III Certification Team, consisting of: Dr. Levendusky; \nDr. Mikkelson; Dr. Charlot, Dr. Christopher  Fox, and Thomas ADzer.  The \n2012-2013  Certification Team  is  in the  process  of reviewing  a sample of \nthirteen individuals and their behavior treatment programs at JRC. reviewing \n40cuments at mc, interviewing staff and clinicianS, and obserVing individuals \non site.  . \n80.  Although the Level III Certification Team has consistently identified serious \nissues in JRCts utilization of Level ill aversives, both. the Department and the' \nCertification  Team  have  throughout  this  six-year  pos~-receive¢rip period \nworked with JRC and its clinicians to attempt to bring JRC into compliance \nwith the Department's regulations govetning Qehavior management.  It should \nbe noted that in each response that JRC has made to the Level 'III Team's \nreports. it has asserted that the Department's efforts to enforce compliance with \nits regulations violated the Decree;, anc). ¥s most recently, demanded arbitration \non its own compliance. \nMonitoring Restraint Use \n81.  The Pepartment's.regulatory monitoring of restraints at JRC includes oversight \nof emergency restraint practices, issuance of mechanical restraint waivers, and \nthe review of individual restraint forms.  . \n~2.  The Department's Office for  Hwnan Rights  is  delegated  the:  authority for \noversight of the  use  of mechanical  restraints  in the  community  per  DnS \nregulations. 115  CMR 5.1l(6)(bJ(2).  For approximately 10 YeaI'$. the DDS \nOffice for Human Rights ~ worked coOperatively with )RC in this regulatory \noversight and, monitoring function ' to . ensure restraint practices at JRC  ate \nappropriate and consistent with DDS regulations: \n83.  Through the oversight and collaboration of the DDS Office for HliInan RightS \nwith JRe. the utilization of waivers for the use of mechanical restraints at JRC \nhas dropped dIamatically from earlier years and by 2008 there were only three \nshort-term  restraint waivers  issued  to  JRe.  Renewals  of these  shorHerm \nrestraint waivers have been granted to. JRC by DDS as-needed.  The utilization \nl6. \n\nof less ~ctive bebvioral strategies than restraint at JRC has been Jargely \nsuccessful, although JRC has continued to incl~~ limitation of'movem~t or \nrestraiIit as part of Level ill behavior plans for those already authoriZed to \nreceive Level III aversiv~, In 2011, there was only one waiver issued for one \nindividual with renewals between January and Aprilg'railted asileeded. \n84.  With  respect  to  the  monitoring  pf  emergency  restratnts  at  iRe,  the. \nDepartment's Office for Ruman Rights bas developed, with JRC's ~istance, a. \nroutine  submission· p~ for  the  review  of emergency  restraint  data. \nMonitqringemergeilcy restraints at JRC initially iIlvolv.~ a massive sUbmission \n~f paper e.ach month.  A representative sampling of the p~r subIIiission would \nbe reviewed by 14e Office for Human Rights to assess certain trends and factors. \nThrough the oversight of the DDS Office for Human Rights, the Utilization. of \nthe  and \nemergency ~nts has decre8$ed sin~  end of the receiversrup  there \ncontmue to be ongoing discussions about the use of lesscoeicive approaches to \nde~scalation and the Prevention of unnecessary restraint at JRe facilities. \nProlilWption of ReguiatiODS Prohibiting the Use. of Aversives \n8$.  On June· 8.  2011. DDS  issued a. notice' of its intent to  amend its eXisting \nbehavior modification regulations to prohibit the us~of Level ill aversives.  In \ntesponsei on July 6, 2011, JRe notified DDS that of its position that· \"[t]he \nProposed Amendments. violate the 1986 Settlement Agreement between DDS \nand· •.. iRO\" and \"demand[ed]t;bat DDS immediately witll:draw the Pro~sed \nAmendments and cancel any public he8rlngs about same as they constitute acts \nof cO:t}tempt s~bjecting DDS. the Commonwealth; and responsible parties to \nCOntempt s'anctions  and penalties.\"  (A copy of this July 6,  2011  letter is \nalt!!ched  h~to as exhibit 7.)  If DDS  refused  to  withdraw the Proposed \nAmendment, JRe demanded aIbitiation.  Id. at p.  185.  On or about July 12, \nme's \n2011. the Department responded to  claims of contempt.  request for \nmediation  and  in$,istence  on  the  withdrawal  of the  proposed  regulatory \nCA \namendments.  copy of the DepartineDt's July 12, 2011  letter is attached \n. hereto as exhibit 18.)  The Department encouraged IRe to :submit comment on \nthe proposed amendments.  Id. \n86.  The Department condUcted two days of public hearings iIi venues a~ss the \nstate. Itheard testimony and received wri.~ comments from nationa4 $tate anq . \nlocal disability advocacy organizations, human rights or~ons, clinicians \nand professio~s.  serving ~dividuals with disabilities arid severe behavioral \nchallenges, provider organizations, a uniQn whose m~bers serve individuals \nwith disabilities, family membeIs of persons with intellectual.d isabilities. autism \nand other disabilities with challenging behaviors. attorneys representing such \nindividuals and others.  . \n87.  The overwhelming number of written comments received by the Department \nwere in support of the proposed regulations. Of a total of 286 written commentS \nreceived\" 271 were in support of the proposed regulations and 15 were· opposed \nto the proposed regulations. Of a total of97 .oral conu!lentS., 24 people ~mitted \ntheir co~ents in writing as well Of the 73 unduplicated oral conunents. 15 \n17 \n\nwere in suppOrt and 56 W~ opposed to the proposed regulationS. All of the \nme \ncomments opposed to the regulations came from individuals affiliated with \nme \nincluding approximately 59  employees, 2 attorneyS, 9 family members an~ \none  former  student  (Copi,es  of all  written  comments  received  by  the \nDepartment ate attached hereto as exhibit 8; copies of the transcripts from the \ntwo daysofpuhlic hearlng.are attached hereto as exhibits 9 and 10.) \n88.  The Written  comments received from  national  and  state associations were \nQyerwhelmingly in support of the proposed teguiations.  Of particular note Were \ncomments from the Presjcietit's Natioruil Council on Disabilities, the American \nAssociation  on  IntenectiJal  and  Developmental  Disabilities  (Massachusetts \nChapter),  the  ARC  of Massachusetts,  the  National  Association  of State \nDirectors  of  Developmental  Disability  Services,  the  Asso'(iation  of \nOeyelopmentat  Disability  Providers,  the  Massachusetts  Developmental \nDisabilities COWlcil, MA AdvoCates S~ding Strong, the Pr.ovid~ Council, \nor \nt ASH and many others. None of the oral  written comments received front \nIJational or state organi~tions opposed the proposed regulations.  To the limited \nextent that  the  written  comments,  other than  those. receive<!  from  people \naffiliated with }RC. disagreed with the proposed regulation. ~ey did so Dilly \nbecause the regulation imposed' only a prospective ban on aversives, rather than \nan outright ban.  See, e.g.~ exhibit 8. at pp. 367-375, 447-451, 586-608, 673-\n675~ 681-683.105-719.722-72'3. \n89;  In its TeSpanseto public comments; the DepartIIient noted that &S of the Oct()ber \n14. 20U publication of its comments, a review of the other forty-nine states and \nthe District of Columbia indicated that 21  state~ specifically \"ban\" or p~ohjbit \naversive interventions through statutes, regulation or policy: Alabama, ArizOna, \nArkansas~ Colorado. Connecti'eut, District pf Columbia, Florid~ Illinoisj Indiana, \nMaryhlnd.  Michigan.  Missouri,  Mon~ Nevada.  New  Mexico,  Oklahoma. \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota; Vermont, aM WashiIigton. Ollr review \nfurther indicated that other states have infonnally adopted practices of using only \npositive supports and, in practice, have banned the USe of aversive interventicms. \nWe located no state whose practice includes the use of aversives streh as contjng~nt \nskin shock. \n90.

Th~ Department provides residential services to over 900 individuals, many \nwith severe  behavioral  cha1leng~ in its state-operated community syst~m. \nNone of these programs utilize Levei ill interventions. \n92.  The Department ~~tly operates ij,ve (5) ICFs with a total ~ of 552 \nindividuals:  the  Hogan Regional  Center.  the  Glavin  Regional  Center~ the \nTempleton Developmental Center, the Wrentham Developmental Centetand the \nFernald Developmental Center. \n18 \n\n93.

III interventions.  Likewise; \nLevel ill interventions are not used at the Templeton Developmental Center or \nthe FeIIlald Developmental Center.  . \n96.  The Dep8rtment also provides residential and day supPorts to thousands of \nindividuals' with serious. behavioral challenges through its provider system. \nAmong the Department's 300 prOvide~ are several thai specialize in providing \nsupports to persons with severe behaviotal problems.  Providers such as Amego, \nInc. and Community Resources for Justice, SJX'Cialize in providing ~identia1 \nand other supports to individuals with severe behavioral problems Without the ' \nuse ofL  evel ill interventions. \n97.  These providers'use priinarily' behavior planning, positive behavioral Supports, \nstaff training, environmental controls ant'l where. appropriate, medicatioIl; to \nteach individuals how to S'Ucc~ssfully control or·r egulate their own behavior. \n98.  Under the Department's current tegulatioDS; a proVider must be authorized \nQefore it may use Level II or Level III aversive .interventions. \n99.  Level  II  aversive  interVentions  may  include  \"contingent  application  of \nunpleasant sensorystlmuli such ·as. loud noises. bad tastes, bad odors. 01\" other \nstimuli which elicit a startle·r esponse['1\" short delay of meal, or time out up to \n15 minutes. 115 C.M.R 5. . 14 (3)( c): \n100.

As explained aboVe, Level m aversive interventions are permitted.t o be used by \nproviders who are certified by the Department only for individuals whb had a \nsubstituted  judgm~t treatment  plan  that  included  Level  III  aversiv(: \ninterventions as of September 1, 2011. \nas \n102.  Currently. and throughout my tenure  Commissioner, the Department has \nreceived applications for and certified only two providers to utilizc· Leve~ III \n19 \n\ninterventioD.$: .ntC and the Wrentham Developmental Center..  The Wrentham \nDevelopmental Center formerly used a Level III mterVenti(m of time--out: greateF \nthan  15  minut(:S' for  one person;' currently,  it does  not use  any Level  rn \ninterverition. \n103..  As of January 17;2013 JRC had a total student population of232; of those. 86 \nstudents had c1lrr.ent court-approved treatment pianS ~t authorized the ~ 'of \nLevel III interventions. \n104.  n:. its, co~unity system and iil its $.te facilities, the Deparbnent provides care \nand  treatment  to  individuals  with  as,  severe  <ijSabilitic;s  and  as  difficult \n.sm) \n(ag~ive  behaviors as individuals at JRC.  ' \n105. From January 1, 2007 to tile pre,sent, the Department hastransferre4 seven (7) \nindividuals from JRC to community or its ICFs successfully.  In all cases but ' \none,  those  individuals  were  suc~fuUy transitioned  from  treatment  with \naversives to treattnentwithoutaversiveS. \nlQ~. A  p~ obstacle  to  transitioning  individuals  who  are  receiving  OED \ntreatlnent from JRe to less ~ctive setting~ is that the individualS have a \nlearned dependence upon the, GED to control their behaviors; 'they have no \ni~ternalized meth.ods  to  cont{oItheit behaviors.  One  indivichJal  v.rh()  w.as \nira:nsitioned from mc would beg staff at his new placemeht to give him the \nQED in order to stop his behavioIaI outbursts.  Although the dependence was \neventually overcome, and the individual learned other inetliods of controlling \nhis own  aggressive  or. self-destructive  impulses,  the  transition period  was \ncharacterized by a p¢od ofexplos~ve b~havior and he reqUir.ed months of close \nmonitoring. \n107.  An9ther  obstacle 'to  transitiQning  individuals  froni  JRC  to  less  restrictive \nsettings can be the guardian's refusal to conSider any medication as an.adjunct \nto other behavioral treatment-.  Some guardians have,h ad prior experiences with \nmedication that have made them unwilling to corlS:ic:Jer any new medication or \ncombination of me,dications that may proVe effective. One individual who had \nresided at.J RC for many years with the OED, and wh9se guardian refused any \npsychotropic medication even after a move from JRC to the Hogan Regional \nreturn \nCenter, had an ~successful1ransitiQn, 8IJ.d his guardians insisted that he \ntoJRC. \n108. There are other individuals who reside at JRe whose parents or guardians. refuse \n.  to  consider rion ... aversiye treatin~t options,  ~t for whom the Department \nrn \nbelieves it coUld provide or arrange less restrictive placements without Level \n.interventions. \nThe AUgust 2007 Incident &, Criminal Investigation \n109.  On August 26,2007, a serious incident of abuse occurred at JRC involving'the \nerroneous application of over 77 applications of contingent skin shock to one \nstudent at JRC, and 29 applications to another.  .. \n20 \n\n110.  The events that occurred were all captured by JRC on the video systelll. that JRC \nuses. to monitor sfudents' behavior. \n111. JRe issued a \"cortective action plan\"  following the incident, in whjch certain \nchanges.were made to ~C's policies. \n112. After the reporting of the August 26, 2007 incidentt three agencies of th~ \nC.ommonwealth conducted investigations: DPPC pursuant to M.GL. cpapter \n19C (for disabled adults· age 18-59); DCF (for children under 18 years of age) \npursuant to O.L. c. 51A; in corijunction with DEEC (resPQn,sible for lice~ing' \nJRe's children's ~idences). \n113. In 2008. EO~S also convened a group of psych910gists familiar with the \ntreatment of individuals with intellectual disability, and extremely problematic \nbehaviors and :mediCal doctors to consider, as a poliq matter, the efficacy of \naversive treatment and its prevalence as a treafinent for persons With disabilities. \nThe group met twice~ and Ultimately made recomm,endations to th~ ~retary of \nEQHHS  that aversive  treatment for'  persons  with  disabilities  was not  the \nstandard oreare. \n114. Upon infottnation aIu;1 belief,. at or around the same tirile the Attorney General \nconvened. a grand jury to investigate the. August 26, 2007 incident for criminal \nwrongdoing,  In May of 2011,. the:: grand j1lIY ~d an indictment, charging \nJRe's then-Executive Director.

Should the individual students of the Behavior Research Institute (BRI) whose\nlives, health, and welfare are directly affected by the pending litigation between BR1 and the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation (DMR) be permitted to intervene as of right or\npermissively, under Mass. R. Civ. P. 24(a) or 0a)?\n2. Does the class of parents and students certified by the trial court and represented\nby the same attorney who represents the corporate intervenor, the BRI Parents and Friends\nAssociation, Inc., adequately represent the individual students of BRI under Rule 24(a) of the\nMass. R. Cir. P.?\n3. Are individual members of a class, certified under Rule 23 of the Mass. R. Civ.\nP., precluded from intervening in an action to protect interests that have not been adequately\nrepresented by the class and the class attorney?\nSTATEMENT OF TIlE CASE\nAfter a protracted licensing dispute between the Massachusetts Office for Children\n(OFC) and the Behavior Research Institute (BRI), a Settlement Agreement was signed by the\nparties on December 12, 1986 and approved by the probate court on January 7, 1987. App.\n51-70. As a result of three new and critical events -- (1) a decisior by tile Department of\nMental Retardation (DMR) in February 1994 threatening to decertify BRP; (2) a series of\ncontempt motions filed by BRI against DMR under the Settlement Agreement in late 1993\nand 1994; and (3) actions by the probate court in late 1993 allowing certain lawyers for the\nCertification is the process used by the Department to review and approve the use of\nbehavior modification procedures by programs which serve persons with mental disabilities.\n\nstudentsto withdraw from the case and appointing others in their stead -- the individual\nstudents moved to intervene in the equity action on March 30, 1994. 2 See Complaint in\nIntervention, App. 86-136; Motion to Intervene, App. 79-85. DMR supported the motion.\nBRI opposed the students' request to intervene, as did attorneys C. Michclle Dorsey and Paul\nCataldo, purporting to act on behalf of a class of students, 3 App. 143-49, and Eugene Curry,\nwho represented the BRI Parents and Friends Association Inc., an intervcnor organization in\nthe case. App. 150-59.\nOn April 5, 1995, the probate court finally held a hearing on the students' motion to\nintervene. It issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion on May 18,\n1995. 4 App. 241-44. At the same time, the court scheduled a trial on BRI's contempt\nmotions to begin June 26, 1995. On May 24, 1995, the students filed their notice of appeal.\nApp. 245. On May 31, 1995, the students sought a stay of the trial from a single justice of\nThe motion was accompanied by a request by each attorney who had been appointed to\nrepresent individual students in pending substituted judgment treatment petitions that they be\nappointed as the next friend of each of the students who they represent. App. 130-42. That\nrequest was appropriate because of the attorneys' ex¢ensive familiarity with the needs, interests,\nand preferences of the individual students. It was necessary because, under numerous decisions\nof the Supreme Judicial Court, the students' plenary guardians who supported the use of painful\naversives and who had requested authority to consent to the administration of extraordinary\ntreatme_t were not in a position to independently determine the views and preferences of their\nwards in a related injunctive proceeding concerning the appropriateness of and necessity for that\nsame extraordinary treatment.\n3 As it turned out, Mr. Cataldo and Ms. Dorsey did not represent a class of students\nbecause there was no certified class of students. See pp. 26-28, infra.\nAlthough the trial court did not discuss most of the factors under either Rule 24(a) or (b),\nit apparently acted under both of these sections in denying the motion. App. 242-43. It is at\nleast clear that the individual students filed their intervention motion under both sections and set\nfo,'th sufficient facts and claims to justify both intervention as of right as well as permissive\nintervention. App. 79-84.\n\nthe Appeals Court under Mass. R. App. P. 6(a) and appealed the denial of their request for\npermissive intervention pursuant to G.L.C. 231, §118, para. 1. The single justice denied\nboth the petition and the request for a stay on June 5, 1995. See A.C. 95-J-415, App. 249.\nA further request for a stay of the trial from a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court\nwas denied on June 21, 1995. See SJ-95-0293, App. 250.\nThe individual students then appealed the trial court's judgment to the full Appeals\nCourt. The clerk of the trial court, apparently acting on instructions from the judge, refused\nto assemble the record. App. 252. Another interlocutory appeal to a single justice of the\nAppeals Court pursuant to G.L.c. 231, §118, para. 1 was necessary to compel the clerk to\nassemble the record. See Order, No. 95-J-564, July 25, 1995, App. 254. A request for\nDirect Appellate Review was allowed by this Court on September 6, 1995.\nSTATEMENT OF TtlE FACTS\nRather than considering the factors relevant to intervention under either Mass. R. Cir.\nP. 24(a) or (b), the trim court's memorandum opinion and order denying the individual\nstudents' motion to intervene instead concluded that since the students already were members\nof a plaintiff class comprised of all students and parents, they should not be permitted to\nintervene. App. 244. That conclusion was based upon certain questionable assumptions\nconcerning the right of the individual students to participate as parties in a matter which\ndirectly affects their rights and interests.\nOn April 29, 1986, shortly after the filing of the first amended complaint in this case,\nthe lower court appointed Marc Perlin and Max Volterra to represent the \"potential class\" of\nall students at BRI in an action filed by BRI against the then Director of the Office for\n3\n\nChildren.s App. 71. On June 4, 1986, without an opportunity for hearing and without\nmaking any findings, as required by Mass. R. Cir. P. 23, the probate court \"preliminarily\"\ncertified a different class -- one comprised of both students and parents -- solely for purposes\nof preliminary injunctive relief. App. 41-44. Two parents were appointed as class\nrepresentatives for this purpose. This actual class supplanted the earlier \"potential class.\"\nApp. 41. It was represented by attorney Robert A. Sherman, and included both parents of\nresidents as well as the then residents of BRI. 6 App. 44. Attorneys Perlin and Voltcrra\ncontinued to be involved in their capacity as guardianship counsel for their individual clients.\nThe court explicitly deferred final action on class certification, and particularly on the\ndefinition of any class, until trial of the case in chief. App. 41.\nThe case was never tried. Instead, the defendant and plaintiffs settled the case. On\nDecember 12, 1986, BRI and the attorney for the preliminarily certified class jointly moved\nfor class certification with the assent of defendants. App. 47. They filed no supporting\nmemorandum, but on that same day, without providing notice to putative classmembers,\nwithout affording either parents or students an opportunity to object, 7 and, in fact, without\n5 Messrs. Perlin and Volterra previously had been appointed as counsel for five individual\nstudents in related guardianship proceedings, which were initiated by BR1 allegedly on the\nstudents' behalf. Thus, from the inception of this litigation, the probate court has always\nrecognized the appropriateness of the guardianship counsel assisting the students in this action.\n6 Only a small portion of the current residents of BRI attended the school in 1986, when\nthe preliminary injunction was entered. All of those who did not were never part of any\n\"potential class' that might have existed, never received any notice of their class membership\nor appointed \"class counsel,\" and never were made aware of any class certification decision.\n7 Prior to the filing of this motion, one parent, one guardian, and two students had voiced\ntheir objection to being included in any class and had separately moved to intervene because they\nstrongly opposed the positions of the \"class representative\" and class counsel. See Motion of\nBruce Deniz and Robert Collins to Intervene, November 26, 1986, App. 13. This clear division\n4\n\nconductinganyevidentiaryhearingatall, thecourt certified a class of \"all students at\nBehavior Research Institute, Inc., their parents, and, where so appointed, their guardians as\nof September 26, 1985. \"s App. 49-50. The 1987 Settlement Agreement was signed by\nrepresentatives of BRI, OFC, 9 a class of students and parents, and the two attorneys\nappointed in the substituted judgment proceedings, as counsel for some BRI students. App.\n64. From the entry of the Settlement Agreement until September 1993, there was relative',y\nlittle activity in this case.\nIn 1991, Mr. Sherman left private practice and joined the Office of the Attorney\nGeneral. _° No substitute counsel was ever appointed for the class of parents and students.\nRather, the parents' distinct interests have been represented by their own attorney, Eugene\nCurry, who filed pleadings in response to the students' intervention motion on behalf of the\nBRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc., an organizational intervenor in this case for at\nleast the past several years. App. 150.\nbetween putative classmemhers should have led the probate court to at least afford them an\nopportunity for a hearing and, in any event, disclosed serious questions about the adequacy of\nrepresentation of the named plaintiffs.\ns Several weeks later, Robert Sherman signed the Settlement Agreement as counsel for \"the\nClass of All Students at BRI, Their Parents, and Guardians.\" _ Soucy and Peter Bi_,caxdi,\nboth parents, signed as class representatives. App. 64. Marc Perlin and Max Volter_a also\nsigned this Settlement Agreement as \"counsel for BRI clients.\" ld. They did not, and could\nnot, sign as counsel for any class comprised only of students, since BRI residents were\nsubsumed in the class which Mr. Sherman represented.\n9 The Department of Mental Retardation was subsequently substituted for the Office as the\ndefendant, because it assumed the responsibility for licensing, regulating, and monitoring BRI.\n_o In 1994, Robert Sherman left the Attorney General's Office and joined Eckert Seamans\nCherin & Mellot, the firm of Roderick MacLeish, who has represented the plaintiff BRI since\nthe inception of this litigation. Mr. Sherman then filed his appearance for BRI in this action.\n\nAfter receiving notice of BRI's motion for contempt and the resumption of significant\nactivity in the case, attorneys Perlin and Volterra moved to withdraw from the case. In\ngranting their motions, the probate court appointed two new attorneys, C. Michele Dorsey\nand Paul Cataldo, to represent what the court mistakenly referred to as \"the class of\nstudents.\" App. 74. However, no such class exists, nor could it, because a differently\ndefined class already had been certified.\nOn September 2, 1993, BRI filed a motion to further amend its complaint, a request\nfor preliminary relief, and a motion for contempt against DMR, alleging interference in the\noperation of its program as a result of administrative monitoring and licensing activities\ninitiated by the state agency.\" App. 19. On February 9, 1994, DMR issued a conditional\ncertification decision, granting BRI final approval to use behavioral aversive techniques if it\nmet certain requirements within ninety days& App. 118-36. BRI never appealed the\ncertification decision. Instead, it simply informed DMR that it had no intention of complying\nwith the agency's order, claiming it was no bound by from state regulation and certification\nas a result of the Settlement Agreement. After extensive discussions between BRI and DMR\n,_ clarify these conditions, DMR issued a final, unconditional certification decision on\nJanuary 26, 1995, which granted BRI a two year certification, but limited the range of\npermissible aversives and imposed certain reporting and access requirements. App. 160-70.\n\" Several amendments to the contempt motion have been subsequently filed, the most recent\nin March 1995. See App. 32.\n_2 DMR's decision identified twelve major deficiencies in BRI's program. It conditioned\npermanent certification of BRI upon compliance with specific remedial actions which DMR\nrequired in each deficiency area.\n6\n\nAgain, BRI never appealed the agency's decision but instead insisted that the Department's\nreg;miatory decision was illegal and of no effect. App. 171-72. It also sought to enjoin\nDMR's decision and pressed for a prompt trial on its contempt motions. App. 25.\nIn its May 18, 1995 order denying the students' motion to intervene, the probate court\nsurprisingly concluded that the class comprised of students and parents is represented by Mr.\nCurry, even though all pleadings in this matter which have been filed by him are on behalf\nof an intervenor corporation, the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc., _3 and even\nthough in November 1993 that same court had supposedly appointed Ms. Dorsey and Mr.\nCataldo to represent a \"class of students.\"_4 App. 74.\nThe trial court's order recognized separate representation for the students \"to be\nimportant in protecting the Students from potential conflict with the interests of the Parents\nand Guardians.\" May 18, 1995 Order, App. 243. Although no subclass had ever been\nJ3 BRI explicitly conceded at oral argument on the intervention motion that Mr. Curry\nrepresented the Parents Association as a party in this case. It asserted: \"The parents have a\nparents group. They've hired an attorney. That's certainly within their right. 1 think it is\nappropriate.\" Transcript of April 4, 1995 hearing at 52, App. 226. Mr. Curry concurred with\nthis role:\nI happen to represent three-quarters of the parents .... [M]y clients, who have\nretained me to participate in this proceeding, have a common interest in making\nsure that the option of treatment at the Judge Rotenberg Center remains available.\n/d. at 55. For the lower court to conclude, despite the absence of evidence and in face of the\nexplicit statements of counsel for the BRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. as well as by\ncounsel for BRI that Mr. Curry actually represents the class of students and parents was clearly\nerroneous.\n_4 These attorneys also labored under the mistaken impression that they represented a class\nof students, although one never existed, since they filed their pleadings in response to the\nstudents' intervention motion on behalf of such a class. App. 143.\n7\n\ncertified or student class representatives identified separate from the parent class\nrepresentatives, the lower court's order concluded that Attorneys Dorsey and Cataldo are\n\"Counsel to Student members of the Class. /d. This decision is clearly inconsistent with the\nevidence, the history of this litigation, the fights of the students, and the requirements of\nRule 23. Moreover, the probate court's order never considered the right of individuals to\nintervene in a proceeding, even if they are unnamed members of a class, in order to assert\nand protect their own interests.\nThe trial on BRI's contempt motion commenced on June 26, 1995 and concluded\nalmost a month later. The motion to intervene and subsequent appeal are not moot even\nthough the contempt trial has been completed, since the individual students' interest in\nparticipating in the ongoing equity case continues. That case, which has been active for the\npast decade and is likely to remain so for some time in the future, continues to directly\ndetermine the scope of the monitoring and regulatory protection the students will receive\nfrom the duly-authorized licensing agency, the Department of Mental Retardation. While the\nintervention motion was prompted in part by circumstances related to the Department's 1994\ncertification decision and BRI's contempt motion, it was by no means limited to those\nmatters, as more fully described in the students' motion. App. 81-83. In addition, the\nstudents continue to have an interest in the basic issues litigated in the contempt proceeding,\neither on appeal or in any future hearing before the trial court. In fact Justice Abrams noted,\nin denying the students' motion to stay the contempt trial, that a prompt appeal to a full\npanel of the Appeals Court was appropriate. App. 250.\n8\n\nSUMMARY OF TIlE ARGUMENT\nThe individual students' motion to intervene satisfies the standards for both\nintervention as of right and permissive intervention. Their motion was timely since it was\nfiled within sixty days of the time when DMR took the decisive action to decertify BRI that\nthreatened the students' interests in continued treatment, education, and related services.\n(pp. 10-14). The students' have an indisputable interest in this matter, which will be directly\naffected by the resolution of BRI' contempt motion, as well as by other proceedings and\ndecisions in this case. Such resolution will impede, if not foreclose, the intervenors' ability\nto protect those interests or assert them, especially in related forums such as substituted\njudgment proceedings involving the same questionable practices and aversive interventions.\n(pp. 15-18). These interests are not adequately represented by any party, and particularly\nnot by the attorney who represents both a corporate intervenor, the BRI Parents and Friends\nAssociation, Inc., as well as the combined class of parents, guardians, and students. (pp. 18-\n26). Nor are the students adequately represented by two attorneys who were mistakenly\nappointed by the lower court to represent an uncertified and non-existent class or subclass\ncomprised solely of students. (pp. 26-33).\nThe individual students clearly meet the more lenient standards for permissive\nintervention, since their application was timely, it involves common questions of law and\nfact, and intervention would not delay or prejudice the adjudication of the parties' claims.\n(pp. 34-38).\nThe lower court erroneously assumed that absent classmembers were automatically\nprecluded from intervening in this proceeding. In fact, intervention is the preferred method\n9\n\nfor addressingsubstantiaalndunreconcilable conflicts between the vast majority of\nclassmembers and the named class representatives, who speak only through their parents,\nwho identically mirror the views of their parents, who share few if any critical characteristics\nwith other classmembers, and who have never asserted all independent position from BRI.\n(pp. 39-40).\nFinally, just as guardians do not have the authority to consent to extraordinary\ntreatment such as painful aversives on behalf of their wards, so too they cannot be the proper\nrepresentatives of their wards in an injunctive proceeding which is focused exclusively on the\nappropriateness of such extraordinary interventions on persons with severe disabilities.\nTherefore, the individual students need next friends to assist them to participate in that\nproceeding. The most appropriate next friends for these individual students are the\nguardianship counsel who are the most familiar with their needs, interests, preferences, and\nfights at BRI. (pp. 39-45).\nARGUMENT\n1. TIlE STUDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO INTERVENE AS OF RIGI1T UNDER\nMASS. R. CIV. P. 24(a).\nTogether with their motion to intervene, the individual students filed a Complaint in\nIntervention, detailing their claims against the Department of Mental Retardation. App. 86,\n109-11. Their accompanying memorandum of law described in detail the reasons why their\nmotion met the four standards for intervention as of right under Mass. R. Civ. P. 24(a). Is\n_s Rule 24(a)(2) states that:\nUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: ... (2) when\nthe applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject\n10\n\nTheprobatecourt'sopinionandorderfailedtoanalyzeor evendiscussanyof thesefactors.\nApp. 242-43. Its denialof themotionwhollyignoredthecriteriafor intervention. /d. A\ncareful analysis of the motion to intervene pursuant to the relevant criteria of Rules 24(a)\nleads to the conclusion that the individual students clearly satisfied the standards for\nintervention as of right. At the very least, the individual students are entitled to a fair\nconsideration of their motion as required by the rules and implementing decisions. See\nMa)flower Development Corp. v. Town of Dennis, 11 Mass App. Ct. 630, 631,418 N.E.2d\n349, 351 (1981).\nWhile Massachusetts appears to have adopted an \"abuse of discretion\" standard of\nreview for trial court decisions on motions to intervene as of right, it is clear that this review\nis both searching, Cosby v. Dept. of Social Services, 32 Mass. App. 392 (1992), and more\nstringent than the standard used to review denials of permissive intervention. International\nPaper Company v. Town of Jay, 887 F.2d 338 (lst Cir. 1989). 16 The court in Jay\nunderscored its willingness to reverse denials of motions to intervene as of right, stating:\nWe will, therefore, reverse a district court's denial of intervention if the court\nfails to apply the general standard provided by the text of Rule 24(a)(2), of if\nthe court reaches a decision that so fails to comport with that standard as to\nof the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical\nmatter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest\nis adequately represented by existing parties.\n_6 Because there are few state court decisions on this rule and because the language of the\nparallel federal rule (Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 24) is substantially the same as the Massachusetts rule,\nstate courts generally follow federal decisions construing the requirements for intervention.\nAttorney General v. Brockton Agricultural Society, 390 Mass. 431,434 n.3,456 N.E.2d 1130,\n1133 n. 3 (1983), citing Rollins Environmental Services, Inc. v. Superior Court, 368 Mass. 174,\n179-80, 330 N.E.2d 814, 818 (1975).\n11\n\nindicate an abuse of discretion.\nJay at 344. In this case, the court both failed to undertake a proper analysis under Rule\n24, and committed error when it found that individual students were adequately represented.\nA fair consideration of the relevant factors demonstrates that the individual students have\nclearly met the standards for Rule 24(a) intervention.\nA. The Application Was Timely.\nThere can be little argument that the request was timely. Many, if not most, of the\nstudents who presently attend BRI were not students at the time the Settlement Agreement\nwas approved by the Court on January 7, 1987. Therefore, many of the current students did\nnot have an opportunity to intervene earlier, at the most significant phase of the litigation.\nUntil September of 1993, there had been little controversy under the Settlement Agreement.\nThe critical event triggering the students' request to intervene was DMR's February 9, 1994\ncertification decision, t7 App. 118. Only after this decision letter was issued was it\nmanifestly clear that this dispute could have severe ramifications for the students, including\ndecertification of BRI by early August of 1994 if certain conditions were not met or\nimmunity by BRI from DMR regulations. It was only recently that the individual students\nwere no longer able to participate, at least informally, in this proceeding through their\nguardianship counsel, as had been the practice for the past seven years prior to the\n17 The agency's action came after an extensive review into the aversive, restraint, treatment,\ninvestigation, reporting, and research practices at BRI. This review had prompted BRI to file\nits first contempt motion in Septembe r 1993, which asserted that the Settlement Agreement\nauthorized BRI to operate free of certain DMR regulations and authorizexi the court monitor,\nrather than DMR, to be the ultimate arbiter of the agency's rules, policies, and licensing\nrequiremer_ts.\n12\n\nwithdrawalof attorneys Perlin and Volterra} s ld. The Appeals Court has stated that \"if\nthe underlying action takes an unexpected turn, _e perceive no reason why the third party\ncannot intervene to protect its position. _ McDonnell v. Quirk, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 133,\n491 N.E.2d 646, 651 (1986). 19\nBecause the students had no reason to suspect that matters would accelerate to this\nlevel, their motion to intervene is timely in light of this unexpected turn of events. 2° See\nFiandoca v. Cunningham, 827 F.2d 825, 834 (lst Cir. 1987)(motion to intervene found\ntimely given class' initial disinterest in litigation, sequence in which events unfolded, and\ngradually growing awareness that its interests may be implicated in the outcome of the case).\nCompare Peabody Federation of Teachers, Local 1289, AFT, AFL-CIO v. School Committee\nof Peabody, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 413-14; 551 N.E.2d 1207, 1210 (1991)(intervention not\ntimely where there was no surprising turn of events, and teacher knew her recovery was in\ndoubt long before filing motion to intervene). See In re Acushnet River & New Bedford\n_* It is significant that it was only after new guardianship counsel were appointed for many\nstudents in November and December 1993 that these issues were identified as directly affecting\nthe students' rights and interests, rather than solely the interests of BRI.\n_9 It is not uncommon, under appropriate circumstances, for intervention to be allowed\nafter judgment, during the implementation and remedial phase of an injunctive case. See\nttalderman v. Pennhurst, 612 F.2d 131, 134 (3rd Cir. en banc 1979) (approving participation\nby intervenor parent group in the relief phase of five year old injunctive case, even if\nsuperfluous at the liability stage).\nThis is not a ease where intervenors could reasonably have been expected to know about\ntheir interests in the suit due to extensive media coverage. See Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d\n15, 21 (lst Cir. 1980)(sophistieated unions should notice news stories about cases affecting their\ninterests); Garrity v. Gallen, 697 F.2d 452, 456 (lst Cir. 1983)(school districts should have\nknown of their interest in case due to extensive media coverage and legislative and court\nactions). Here, intervenors are people with severe mental disabilities who have limited access\nto and understanding of media coverage of this action.\n13\n\nHarbor Proceedings re Alleged PCB Pollution, 712 F.Supp. 1019, 1023 (D.Mass. 1989)(\"the\nsudden revelation of a divergence of interests between the sovereigns and the intervenor\nconstitutes an unusual circumstance militating for intervention\").\nThe intervention by the students in 1994 or early 1995 would not have resulted in any\nprejudice to any party or delay in the proceedings. The intervention motion was filed more\nthan a year before the trial on the contempt motion was even scheduled. In addition, in the\npleadings and at the heating on the intervention motion, the students agreed to waive any\ndiscovery and not to seek any delay in the proceedings. 2' Furthermore, the trial court has\nconsistently acknowledged that the students have a crucial role in this litigation. App. 74,\n243. Their involvement as a party, with intervenor status and guardianship counsel as next\nfriends, would not require a substantial realignment of this long-standing litigation nor the\nintroduction into this case of an entirely new and adversarial interest.\nThe students at BRI have fundamental rights and interests at slake in this case. In\nlight of the importance of addressing these interests, as well as the unique circumstances\nsurrounding the students' desire to intervene at this point in the litigation, their application\nsatisfies the standards for timeliness? 2\n2t At this stage of the case, there clearly is no prejudice since the contempt trial is over and\nthere are no other pending proceedings, other than a number of appeals.\n22 In determining prejudice to an applicant should intervention be denied, one significant\nfactor is the applicant's probability of success on the merits. Garrity, 697 F.2d at 457;\nCulbreath, 630 F.2d at 23. To the extent that this is a consideration here, the students enjoy\na substantial probability of success on the merits, given the many allegations of rights violations\nby BRI and other enforcement failures by DMR.\n14\n\nB. lntervenors Have An Interest in this Action Which May Be Impaired by\nThe Outcome of tlte Case.\nIn order to intervene, the moving party must demonstrate that it has a significarLtly\nprotected interest. Conservation Law Foundation of New England, Inc. v. Mosbacher, 966\nF.2d 39, 41 (lst Cir. 1992), citing Donaldson v. U.S., 400 U.S. 517, 531 (1971). All\nparties to the litigation between BRI and DMR, as well as the probate court, has always\nacknowledged that the residents are entitled to representation in this case because of their\ncritical interest in its outcome. App. 42. All parties agree that the class of residents of\nBR123 \"continues to have the most vital interest in the process and outcome of any litigation\nthat occurs in the above cited matter [the case at issue here]...\" App. 74. Neither the trial\ncourt judge nor any party has ever disputed this in ten years of litigation. Indeed,\nintervenors have perhaps the greatest interest of any party, since the issues in this case\ndirectly affect their very lives and health.\nThe individual students have rights and interests which in some respects parallel and\nin others diverge from those of existing parties. Unless they participate individually in this\naction, their individual rights to (1) safety, (2) freedom from harm, (3) freedom from\nunnecessary restraint, 24(4) freeAom from cnlel and unusual punishment, (5) adequate\ntreatment in the least restrictive setting, (6) safe and effective behavior interventions, (7)\n23 Although there was and continues to be confusion about the nature, representation and\ncomposition of the class, there has never been any disagreement among any of the parties or the\ncourt below about the vital interest of the residents of BRI in this litigation.\n24See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982)(establishing right to safety, freedom from\nunreasonable bodily restraints, and such minimally adequate training as reasonably might be\nrequired by these interests for individual involunfarily committed to a state institution for the\nmentally retarded).\n15\n\nappropriateservicespursuanttoDMR regulations2,s(8)appropriateeducation,(9)\nproceduresandguaranteesundertheSettlemenAtgreement, 26and (10) adequate monitoring\nof services will not be fully represented or protected by any other party or representative\npresently participating in this litigationY All of these rights are potentially threatened by\nBRI's failure to comply with applicable regulations and by DMR's threatened decertifieation\nof BRI. Moreover, the individual students will have no ability to contest or appeal those\ndecisions and orders in this case which affect their individual rights.\nC. Disposition of This Action WouM, As a Practical Matter, Impede lntervenors'\nAbility to Protect Their Interests.\nAll parties in this litigation, as well as the lower court, have consistently\nacknowledged that the outcome of the litigation -- as well as of the discrete contempt motion\nrecently tried before the court below -- will crucially affect the intervcnors' interests, since\nthe process by which their living conditions and treatment are monitored, and their lives and\nhealth are protected, are clearly of greater significance to the students than to any party in\nthis case. The trial court specifically stated that any court decision in the equity case has and\n25See 104 C.M.R. 20.04 (\"[mental retardation] programs are to be designed to provide\nmeaningful habilitation ... through services which ensure (1) Human dignity; (2) Humane and\nadequate care and treatment; (3) Self-determination and freedom of choice to the person's fullest\ncapability; (4) The opportunity to live and receive services in the least restrictive and most\nnormal setting possible; ...').\n26 See Settlement Agreement, §A(3), App. 52 (\"For all clients, BRI shall propose those\ntreatments which are the least intrusive, least restrictive modalities appropriate to each client's\nneeds\").\n_7 This assertion has become prophetic. At the contempt trial, the appointed lawyers for\n\"the student class\" presented no evidence whatsoever. The lawyer who jointly represents the\nBRI Parents and Friends Association, Inc. and the combined class of parents and students\npresented only the views, interests, and testimony of the parents.\n16\n\nwill continuetohaveprofoundimplicationsfor theinterestsof thestudents,includingtheir\ninterestin appropriateandeffectivetreatment,theirinterestin theleastrestrictiveformof\ncare,theirinterestin theprogramor locationin whichtheyreceivethattreatment,andtheir\ninterestin thefair andeffectiveimplementationof theSettlemenAtgreement. App. 74.\nUnless they are allowed to intervene and participate as formal parties in this action,\nthe individual students will have no standing to appeal an adverse disposition of the pending\ncontempt action, any other enforcement decision under tile Settlement Agreement, or any\nother order entered in this litigation. It is significant that the students alone do not now have\nofficial party standing. Because the students have never been formally and permanently\nafforded party status either individually or as a separate group from their parents in this case,\nthey do not have standing to challenge decisions which threaten only their interests or rights.\nThe fact that two guardianship lawyers for the individual students signed the Settlement\nAgreement does not change this fact, since \"an interested party who had taken part in the\n(compromise and settlement) proceedings and had the right to intervene, but had not fornlally\ndone so, was not capable of appealing. [A]s such, a party was not properly on the record as\nan intervenor, and not being a party to the record has no standing to appeal.\" In re Central\nIce Cream Co., 62 F.R.D. 357, 360 (N.D.IlI. 1986)(quoting In re South State Street BMg.\nCorp., 140 F.2d 363,367 (7th Cir. 1943), quoted in In re Thompson, 965 F.2d 1136, 1142\n(lst Cir. 1992).\nNor are the other alternatives to intervention practical or efficient here, particularly in\nlight of the length of this litigation and the existence of the Settlement Agreement. Initiating\nseparate legal proceedings would be made far more difficult by the resolution of virtually\n17\n\nidenticalissueshere. It would certainly be uneconomical to both the trial court and the\nindigent students. Mayflower Development Corp., 11 Mass. App. Ct. at 635, 418 N.E. 2d at\n354 (intervenors' interest in prompt resolution). The disposition of legal issues in this ease\nand under the Settlement Agreement will directly impact the lives and welfare of the\nindividual students. Such disposition, and particularly a final judgment in this action, is\ncertainly likely to impede, both legally and practically, the students from asserting their\nsimilar claims elsewhere. 28\nD. The lntervenors' Interests Are Not Adequately Protected by the F.xisting\nParties.\nThe only real intervention factor at issue under Rule 24(a) is whether the individual\nstudents' interests were adequately represented by either class counsel or appointed\ncounsel. _ While there is a requirement of inadequate representation by existing parties, the\nintervenor need only show that representation may be inadequate, not that it is inadequate.\nConservation Law Foundation, 966 F.2d at 44, citing Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404\nU.S. 528, 538 n. 10 (1972). Students can make this showing as to all parties who are or\nhave been involved in this case.\nNo precise dividing line is indicated in the rule or related cases for determining when\n_ What type of aversives BRI is permitted to use on the students and whether DMR is\nauthorized to certify, regulate, and monitor BRI's program is at the very core of the pending\ndispute raised in the contempt motion. How these questions are resolved not only directly\nimpacts each of the individual students, but it also will determine the scope and content of the\nseparate substituted judgment proceedings. The history of this case has amply demonstrated that\nonce these systemic regulatory issues are resolved in the equity case, they bind the individual\nstudents and cannot be relitigated in each separate guardianship proceeding.\nNo claim has ever been advanced by any party throughout this litigation that the students'\nrights are protected by either the real plaintiff in interest, BRI, or by the defendant DMR.\n18\n\ntheintervenors'interests are adequately protected by the parties. But the usual test requires\na comparison of the interests \"from the perspective of the result sought by [the] proposed\nintervenor vis-a-vis the result sought by the existing party.\" United States v. International\nBusiness Mach. Corp., 62 F.R.D. 530, 536-37 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), quoted in Mayflower\nDevelopment Corp., 11 Mass. App. Ct. at 637, 418 N.E. 2d at 354. Here, the result sought\nby the individual students is distinctly separate and different from that espoused by any of the\nexisting parties or attorneys. Where the \"interest is similar to, but not identical with that of\none of the parties, a discriminating judgment is required on the circumstances of the\nparticular case, but he ordinarily should be allowed to intervene....\" Mayflower Development\nCorp., 418 N.E.2d at 354, quoting 7A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§1909, at 524 (1972).\nOn first examination, there appears to be a surfeit of agencies and individuals charged\nin some way with representation of the students' interests. Paradoxically, this has led to\nconfusion and inadequate representation, which continues to this day. A careful review of the\ninterests and past actions of the existing parties is useful in determining whether they have\nand can adequately represent the interests of the individual students.\n1. BRI\nBRI is primarily concerned in this litigation with maintaining its license to operate and\nretaining the flexibility to employ a wide range of behavioral interventions with minimal\ninterference from regulatory authorities. This may be in conflict with the students' interest\nin the least restrictive form of treatment and in adequate monitoring of BRI's compliance\nwith DMR regulations. There has been considerable evidence amassed since the filing of the\n19\n\nmotiontointerveneconcerning: (1) the use of aversive conditioning devices without\nobtaining the necessary federal approval and in violation of DMR regulations on treatment,\nresearch, and human rights; (2) possible violations of state laws on restraint; (3) the\nconfirmed abuse of two students; (4) the weaknesses of BRI's education program for certain\nstudents; and (5) inadequate monitoring and treatment of medical and psychiatric conditions\nof several of its students. App. 111-12. This information makes it unreasonable to conclude\nthat BR1 can adequately represent all of the students' interests.\n2. DMR\nDMR is sued in its capacity as the statutory licensing agency and regulator for all\nprograms which serve persons with mental retardation. DMR has special procedures for\ncertifying programs to use Level III behavior interventions, which are the most intrusive\nform of aversive treatment. As such, DMR has interests which are distinct from those of the\nstudents. The lower court has recognized these differences from the outset of this litigation,\nfirst by appointing two attorneys (Perlin and Volterra) to represent a potential class of\nstudents and then by certifying a different class of parents and students.\nDMR is motivated primarily by its obligation to ensure full compliance with its\nlegulations. While the students should be expected to benefit from BRI's compliance with\nfile law, they have additional, and perhaps primary, interests in appropriate treatment, less\nrestrictive interventions, and continuity of care. Although some of these interests may be\nrelated to those of DMR, there are clearly distinctions and points of divergence between the\nrights and interests of a regulatory agency and those of its clients. For example, DMR has\nnow terminated BRI's certification to use Level 11I aversives. This decertification could\n20\n\noperate to the detriment of some of the students and to the benefit of others, underscoring the\nneed for individual student intervention and the inadequacy of the current class, which\nassumes that all students and parents have a single point of view.\nViolations of some of the Department's requirements do not necessarily affect the\nstudents at all and certainly not directly; rather they represent a failure by BRI to satisfy a\nparticular administrative interest of the reviewing agency. Yet the decertification may cause\na major disruption in the continuity of the students' care and could result in an inappropriate\nplacement or an inadequate educational program. Where there are substantial differences in\nthe remedy sought, courts have found that there was inadequate representation by existing\nparties that justified intervention. Acushnet, 712 F.Supp. at 1024, n. 7 (substantial\ndifferences in measure of damages sought would impact on the quality of harbor cleanup,\nthus rendering representation inadequate for the purposes of Rule 24(b) and under the\nheightened showing required for Rule 24(a) in United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 696 F.2d\n141, 144 (lst Cir. 1982)). See also Massachusetts Federation of Teachers AFT, AFL-CIO v.\nSchool Committee of Chelsea, 409 Mass. 203,207, 564 N.E.2d 1027, 1030 (1991)(adequate\nrepresentation when parents agreed with the school board both as to the goal and the means\nfor educational reform). Here, on the contrary, the possible remedies and methods of\nachieving the primary goal of a quality residential and educational program appropriate to the\nneeds of each student, as well as the secondary goal of ensuring compliance with DMR\nregulations and other laws, differ significantly between the students and DMR.\nAlthough \"where one party is charged by law with representing its own interests and\nthose interests are the same as or similar to potential intervenor's, adequate representation is\n21\n\npresumed,\"Mass. Federation of Teachers, 409 Mass. at 207-8, that rule has no applicability\nto this situation. First, DMR is not charged with the responsibility for representing the\ninterests of a// Massachusetts citizens with mental retardation or even all of the students at\nBRI. Rather, it is required to take cognizance of and provide services only to certain priority\nclients, consistent with professional standards and within available resources. Moreover,\nDMR has no obligation to protect the rights or safeguard the interests of non-Massachusetts\ncitizens? ° Similarly, it has no responsibility for persons with conditions other than mental\nretardation, as is the case with m,'my BRI students. 3_ Finally, DMR cannot consider each\nindividual student in their actions. As an agency charged with the duty to protect the public\nand, in general, Massachusetts citizens with retardation, it cannot primarily focus on the\nneeds of certain individual students at BRI, cannot fairly weigh their needs and interests\nagainst those of the larger population, and certainly cannot excuse compliance with its rules\nor standards, even if to do so might directly benefit a particular student. 32\n30 Approximately two thirds of BRI's total student population are from other states.\n_ At least one-quarter of BRI's population has not been determined to have mental\nretardation.\n32 Thus, this is not a case where the government's sole reason for initiating legal action is\nto vindicate the rights of the general public or of all individuals within its jurisdiction. See,\ne.g., E.E.O.C.v. United Airlines, 515 F.2d 946 (7th. Cir. 1975) (determination that interests\nof movants who sought to intervene in action by government charging employer with\ndiscrimination in violation of Equal Employment Opportunity Act were adequately represented\nwas not an abuse of discretion). Nor is it like those cases where a government agency, acting\nin the public interest, was found to adequately represent the interests of the intervenors who\nsought to represent the public interest as well. See, e.g., James City, VA. v.

App. 69. In\nfact, for the reasons discussed above, the trial court determined that the interests of DMR are\nactually adverse to those of the students. App. 5 (Preliminary Injunction Order). Similarly,\nit effectively concluded that DMR cannot be said to adequately represent the interests of the\nstudents. 33\n3. The Class of Parents and Students\nAlthough the students are part of a unified class comprised of all students and parents,\ntheir rights and interests hardly can be properly represented by class counsel, Eugene Curry,\nsince by his own admission he instead represents a corporate intervenor, the BRI Parents and\nFriends Association, Inc. in this case. App. 150. Nevertheless, the lower court concluded\nthat \"The Students are adequately represented by the Parents or Guardians as Next Friend.\"\nld. This conclusion was plainly error.\nThe trial court's acknowledgement of the distinct interests of parents and their\nchildren is well established in the law. Courts have traditionally recognized that the interests\nof parents or guardians are at least potentially adverse to those of their family members or\nwards with disabilities. See Parham v. J.L., 442 U.S. 584, 606-07 (1979)(parents should\n33 See also, Conservation law Foundation, 966 F.2d at 44-5, citing Natural Resources\nDefense Council v.

Ct. App., 1989) (citing 39 Am. Jut. 2d Guardian & Ward\n§ 102 (1968); 42 Am. Jut. 2d h_mts § 152 (1969). See Peoph' bTrst of Tennessee v.\nArlington Developmental Center, No. 92-2213-MI/V (Sept. 27, 1995)(deciding that guardians\ndo not have the authority to determine the legal position of a resident with respect to future\ninstitutionalization or discharge).\nThis Court has been especially reluctant to allow parents or guardians to make\nunreviewable treatment decisions for their children or wards, particularly where the\nintervention is considered to be highly intrusive or the outcome drastic. Thus, in Doe v.\nDoe, 377 Mass. 272,280-81,385 N.E.2d 995, 1000-1001 (1979), the Court held that a\nguardian could not decide to admit his ward to a public mental institution unless he obtained\na judicial determination that the ward satisfied the statutory standards for civil commitment.\nAnd a guardian cannot consent to treatment with certain intrusive procedures, including the\nadministration of anti-psychotic medications, without first obtaining court permission\npursuant to a substituted judgment determination. Rogers\" v. Commissioner of the Department\nof Mental ttealth, 390 Mass. 489, 458 N.E.2d 308 (1983). By requiring these safeguards\nfor persons with disabilities, Massachusetts has essentially transferred decisionmaking\n24\n\nauthoritywith respectto certain intrusive activities and treatments from parents and guardians\nto the courts. As such, these cases represent an implicit determination that parents and\nguardians cannot adequately represent the interests of their wards in these situations.\nMoreover, as a practical matter, the parents have, from the outset of this litigation, defined\ntheir interests not as shared with the students and not even as independent, but rather as\ncoterminous with those of BRI.\nThe class of parents and students is, in effect, a duplicate of the intervenor parent\nassociation. The BRI Parents and Friends Association pays and directs class counsel, as he\nhimself has acknowledged. App. 229. The Parents' Association does not represent all\nguardians at BRI, nor all relatives or even all parents. _ No students are consulted in any\nway concerning the actions and decisions of the class counsel. 35\nAt the April 5, 1995 hearing on the individual students' motion to intervene, the court\nmistakenly believed that the certified class consisted solely of residents, that it had been\nrepresented by guardianship counsel Volterra and Perlin until their withdrawal in November\n1993, and that it was thereafter represented by Paul Cataldo and C. Michelle Dorsey. In\nfact, however, the certified class of parents and students had effectively been without counsel\nsince the departure of Robert Sherman several years ago.\nOn May 18, 1995, the lower court attempted to correct the lack of class counsel by\nNot all guardians of BRI residents are parents or relatives; in some cases the state agency\noperates as guardian. Not all parents are members of the BRI Parents' Association or support\nits positions. App. 229.\n35 The process by which students would be consulted by class counsel is inextricably\nintertwined with the need for the appointment of next friends, see pp. 39-45, h_'a.\n25\n\nappointing Eugene Curry, counsel for the BRI Parents and Friends Association, as class\ncounsel for a class of parents and residents. The interests of individual students cannot be\nadequately represented by the Parents' Association. All parents and guardians must sign a\ncontract with BRI when their ward is placed there agreeing to cooperate with BRI in seeking\napproval of BRI's treatment regimen. The Parents' Association has been unconditionally and\nwithout exception supportive of BRI throughout this litigation. Moreover, there is an\nobvious conflict for one attorney to represent not only the competing interests of various\nclassmembers and their respective separate groupings (parents v. residents), but also the\ncompeting interests of all classmembers and an intervenor corporation, the BRI Parents and\nFriends Association, Inc. _\n4. C. MicheUe Dorsey and Paul Cataldo\nDespite the unavoidable reality that, as members of the plaintiff class of all students\nand parents, the students' rights and interests must be represented by class counsel (Mr.\nCurry), the probate court went on to conclude that separate counsel (C. Michelle Dorsey and\nPaul Cataldo) actually represent the students' interests. App. 243. Until the students filed\ntheir motion to intervene, and throughout these proceedings, Ms. Dorsey and Mr. Cataldo\nconsistently claimed to represent a class of students, although no such class was ever\n36 The trial court recognized that the class, as currently constituted _.nd represented, could\nnot adequately address the rights of the residents. Therefore, in its same May 18, 1995 order,\nwithout notice, explanation, or a recertification decision, it implicitly appointed Paul Cataldo and\nC. Michelle Dorsey to an unspecified role involving separate represenfation of an undefined\n\"subclass\" of residents. App. 243. This too was plainly error.\n26\n\ncertified.37App. 143. In itsNovember8, 1993order,thelowercourtappointedMs.\nDorseyandMr. Cataldoto represent\"theclassof students\".3sApp. 74. The probate court\nand some of the parties were apparently content with this erroneous construction until the\nquestion of the students' formal role was raised by their intervention motion. Even when the\nmotion was argued, Mr. Curry claimed to represent a corporation, the BRI Parents and\nFriends Association lne., not any class of students and parents. App. 151. Until May 18,\n1995, the probate court clearly concurred in this alignment. But in the absence of\nsubclasses, properly created under Mass. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and clearly defined after notice to\nall existing classmembers, this contorted reconstruction of the students' role and their counsel\nis neither permissible nor adequate.\nIn this case, the certification requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy\nof representation could not be satisfied by the probate court's implicit and explicit\nconclusions in its May 18, 1995 Order concerning an undefined \"subclass\" of students. App.\n244.\n(a) Commonality\nThe mere fact that the students reside at the same institution does not ensure that the\ncommonality requirement is met. \"Commonality requires more than sharing a common\n37 In fact, they still do. On October 2, 1995, Mr. Curry, apparently acting on behalf of a\nclass of students, parents, and guardians, filed in this Court the class' assent to BRI's motion\nfor a stay of all pending appeals. App. 256. On the same day, Ms. Dorsey and Mr. Cataldo\nfiled the same assent on behalf of \"the class of students.\" App. 255. Thus, the lower court\nintervention decision has perpetuated, if not aggravated, the confusion and procedural\nirregularities with respect to the representation of the students in this case.\nss These attorneys do not represent a certified class or subclass of students, since no such\nclass or subclass has ever been certified and no class representatives ever identified.\n27\n\ncircumstance'.BaMridge by Stockley v. Clinton, 139 F.R.D. 119, 127 (E.D. Ark. 1991).\nClassmembers must \"share a common deprivation,\" ld., which parents and residents clearly\ndo not. In fact, it is even questionable whether the residents themselves have enough in\ncommon to share any singular deprivation. Because the motion for class certification simply\nrecited in a conclusory manner that \"there are questions of law and fact which are common\nto all class members,\" without further elaboration, and because the court order echoed this\nconclusion, it is impossible to know what those common questions might have been, and\nwhether they were outweighed by the numerous distinctions and conflicts between\nclassmembers.\nAt least five significant distinctions are relevant to the students' legal rights and to the\npositions that individual students might want to take in this action. First, most \"students\" are\nadults and do not have statutory rights under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education\nAct (IDEA). 39 See 20 IJ.S.C. §1400 et seq. However, they have constitutional and\ncommon law rights not possessed by minor students or at least not applied in the same\nmanner: ° Secor!d, some students are Massachusetts residents, with rights under state law,\n39 Approximately twenty-five percent of the residents of BRI are under the age of eighteen.\nThey have a right to a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive setting under IDEA.\nThese students have compelling claims to an individualized education program which must be\nfunded by the local education agency where the student or his/her parents reside. In one of the\nleading cases involving institutionalized persons in the First Circuit, children with special\neducation fights were treated as a subclass and distinguished from institutionalized adults because\nof their special legal fight to education. Garrity v. Sununu, 752 F.2d 727, 737 (ist Cir. 1984).\n,o For residents who are minors, presumptions of competence and the application of any\nrights they may have with regard to treatment refusal are different from adults at BRI. The legal\nforce of their parents' conclusions as to their treatment is given special consideration not\napplicable to adult residents of the school. Significantly, over three-quarters of the residents at\n28\n\nwhileothers have separate claims that arise from their state of citizenshipJ'\n\"I1aird, some students have court-approved treatment plans which do not permit such\naversives. Many others have plans which permit these procedures. Those residents who\nreceive Level I11 aversives have a particular interest in the outcome of this litigation that\nother residents do not share, since BRI's ability to employ Level III aversives and DMR's\ndecisions to limit certain practices at BRI are at the very core of this case and the pending\ncontempt motion.\nFourth, there is also a crucial difference between residents with regard to their\npreferences concerning aversive procedures. Some students may prefer to continue receiving\nthese procedures, believing that they are benefiting from them, while others may wish to be\nremoved from aversives and not inflicted with painful punishment. Courts have traditionally\ncertified subclasses when the interests of one group of classmembers collide with another.\nDiaz v. Romer, 961 F.2d 1508, 1511 (10th Cir. 1992)(in challenging prison regulation\nsegregating inmates who tested HIV-positive, court divided class of prisoners into those who\ntested HIV-positive and those who did not); Clarkson v. Coughlin, 145 F.R.D. 339\n(S.D.N.Y. 1993)(in a class action involving hearing-impaired prisoners, the court certified\ntwo subclasses according to gender because male heating impaired prisoners had access to\nprograms denied to female heating impaired prisoners).\nBRI are adults, with distinct legal rights under federal and state statutes and constitutions.\nResidents who are not eligible for special education benefits may have no, or at least a much\nnarrower, entitlement to any form of services, treatment, or educational programs.\n4, For example, some states which send individuals to BRI have banned the aversives used\nat BRI. A student might have a claim that a public agency should not pay for procedures in\nanother jurisdiction which would be outlawed in his own state.\n29\n\nFinally, someresidentsare wards of their natural parents, while others are wards of\nthe state or of a corporate guardian. The Supreme Court has noted that for children who are\nstate wards:\nObviously their situation differs from those members of the class who have\nnatural parents...It is possible that the procedures required ill reviewing a\nward's need for continuing care should be different from those used to review\na child with natural parents...The absence of an adult who cares deeply for a\nchild ... may have some effect on how long a child will remain in the hospital.\nParham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584,617, 619 (1979). Complicating the matter further, some\nstate wards are from other jurisdictions, making the likelihood that their guardians are closely\nmonitoring their treatment needs even less likely. Thus, there appears to be significant doubt\nas to the commonality of the situation of all of the residents.\n(b) Typicality\nThe claims and theory of the class representative(s) must be typical of and not\nconflicting with the claims of the class, and must not operate to disadvantage some members\nof the putative class. Spence v. Reeder, 382 Mass. 398, 409, 416 N.E.2d 914 (Mass.\n1981); Smith v. Babcock, 19 F.3d 257, 265, n. 13 (6th Cir. 1994). Just as there are\nnumerous conflicts between the students which preclude even a unified subclass of all\nstudents, the student representatives, Brendon Soucy and P. J. Biscardi, are not typical of\ntheir fellow students. These named plaintiffs are: (1) Massachusetts residents, whose rights\nand entitlements are governed primarily by Massachusetts law, whereas two-thirds of the\nstudents of BRI are from other states and have separate state law claims which may be\ngreater or lesser than the Massachusetts residents; (2) over twenty-one, while one-quarter of\ntheir colleagues are under this critical age; (3) under the guardianship of their parents, which\n30\n\nisnottruein the case of a significant number of other residents; (4) both receiving Level Ill\naversives; and (5) ardent supporters of aversive therapy whose parents have repeatedly\nspoken out publicly against any form of restriction or regulation of these interventions. The\nresidents of BRI, on the other hand, include a diverse and potentially conflicting range of\nages, conditions, needs, and even legal fights. These variations and conflicts at least require\nsubclassing of various student groupings, so that each set of interests can be adequately\nrepresented. Spence, 382 Mass. at 409.\n(c) Adequacy of representation\nBoth the First Circuit and the leading treatises have given special emphasis to the\nimportance of the requirement of adequacy of representation. See Andrews v. Bechtel Power\nCorp., 780 F.2d 124, 130 (lst Cir. 1985)(\"adequate representation is particularly\nimportant\"); Key v. Gillette Company, 782 F.2d 5, 7 (lst Cir. 1986)(\"one of the most\nimportant of these requirements is that the representative party fairly and adequately\nrepresent the interests of the class); Newberg and Cote, 1 H. NEWBERG ON CLASS\nACTIONS 13.21 at 3-125 (3rd Ed. 1992)(\"Adequate representation is especially important\").\nThe importance of this requirement is due to the fact that Uthe due process rights of absentee\nclass members may be implicated if they are bound by a final judgment in a suit where they\nwere inadequately represented by the named plaintiff.\" Key, 782 F.2d at 7. A non-typical\nclass representative is not an adequate representative. Scott v. University of Delaware, 601\nF.2d 76 (3rd Cir. 1979); Hartman v. Duffy, 158 F.R.D. 525 (D.D.C. 1994).\nMr. Cataldo and Ms. Dorsey were never appointed to represent a subclass of\nresidents, since no such class or subclass exists. They are not constrained by the usual rules\n31\n\nwhichapplyto class counsel and are not accountable to specific clients or class\nrepresentatives. Since they do not even know most (or any) of the individual students, have\nnever represented them, and have no formal relationship with many of them, as do all of the\nguardianship counsel and proposed next friends, it is difficult to understand how these\nattorneys reach whatever positions they asset# z or can be said to \"represent the\nstudents. \"4J If a classmember's interests are not fully and adequately represented, then that\nclassmember is not bound by any court order or fairly subjected to its terms. M.\n5. Guardian Ad Litem\nMs. Bettina Briggs has been appointed a guardian ad litem for all the students\ncollectively. However, she is an officer of the court, reporting to the judge, and as such,\ncould not properly represent the individual students' interests and desires for purposes of\ndetermining what position to take on a particular issue in this case or whether the students\nshould appeal an adverse decision. Indeed, what might be an adverse decision for some\nresidents might be a positive decision for others. In addition, as guardian ad litem for a\n42 Some of the students' guardians are state agencies which Mr. Cataldo and Ms. Dorsey\nhave never contacted. Others are relatives who never visit their wards and with whom Mr.\nCataldo and Ms. Dorsey have not communicated. As a practical matter, this leaves the more\nactive, involved parents to provide guidance as to what all residents would want to Mr. Cataldo\nand Ms. Dorsey. These more active parents belong to the BRI Parents and Friends Association.\nTheir point of view is thus triply represented: by the Association as an intervenor organization,\nby the class counsel (Mr. Curry) whom they employ and pay, and, by default, by Michelle\nDorsey and Paul Cataldo \"on behalf\" of the residents.\n,t_ These counsel have never represented the individual students and are not familiar with\ntheir unique needs and the differences among them. Because of these students' disabilities,\nbecoming familiar with them requires much more time and effort than would representation of\na non-disabled client. Since their appointment, counsel have not spent any considerable time\nwith any of their \"clients\" nor have they challenged any of the allegedly illegal activities of BRI.\n32\n\ncollective of students, Ms. Briggs' role in this litigation overlaps and potentially conflicts\nwith the responsibilities of Mr. Cataldo and Ms. Dorsey, but leaves unrepresented the\nparticularly personal needs and claims of the individual students.\nIt was just because of the obvious confusion with respect to who represented the\nstudents' interests that the individual students sought to intervene. 'a The students should be\npermitted to intervene because their fights and interests are not adequately represented by\nclass counsel who is dedicated exclusively to assisting a corporate intervenor or by separate\nlawyers who act on behalf of an uncertified, undefined, and inherently unworkable subclass.\nThe students, just like the parents, should be able to participate in this case as intervenors,\neven if they also are absent members of a class. 4s The lower court's failure to analyze the\nfactors relevant to intervention as of right and its conclusion that intervention was not needed\nbecause the individual students' interests are represented by the named classmembers was\nclearly error and should be reversed.\n44 The inherent difficulty in his case with parents being the primary decisionmakers with\nrespect to the individual students' interests strongly suggests the need for next friends for each\nof them.\n4s Even if counsel were capable of representing the interests of each individual student or\nall of the students collectively, the protective action of a court does not customarily extinguish\nan individual's freedom to secure counsel. Students, acting either independently or through their\nnext friends, should have the option of securing counsel of their choosing. See Attorney General\nv. Brockton Agricultural Society, 390 Mass. 431, 436, 456 N.E.2d 1130, 1134 (1983)\n(shareholders have constitutional right to participate in pending action through counsel of their\nown choosing).\n33\n\nII. TI_E INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS MEET TIlE STANDARDS FOR PERMISSIVE\nINTERVENTION.\nIn addition to being entitled to intervene as of right, the student intervenors qualify\nfor permissive intervention. 46 The students' application is timely, it raises common\nquestions of law or fact, and it will not unduly prejudice or delay the adjudication of the\nparties' claims. See Corcoran v. Wigglesworth, 388 Mass. 1002, 448 N.E.2d !128\n(1983). 47 The lower court abused its discretion in failing to even address the requirements\nof Rule 24(b)(2) or to make any determination whatsoever with respect to the students'\nrequest for permissive intervention.\nMass. R. Civ. P. Rule 24(b)(2)provides:\nUpon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: ... (2) when\nan applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in\ncommon .... In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention\nwill unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\n47 The Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 24(b)(2) explicitly omits any requirement that the applicant\ndemonstrate the inadequacy of representation by any of the existing parties. However, in\nconstruing the federal rule, some courts nevertheless consider this to be a factor in determining\nwhether to allow permissive intervention. See, e.g., in re Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1137. This\nrequirement is seen as being more lenient for permissive intervention than for intervention of\nright. Acushnet, 712 F.Supp. at 1024. And some cases do not seem to consider adequacy of\nrepresentation for permissive intervention. See Resolution Trust Corp. v. City of Boston, 150\nF.R.D. 449 (D.Mass. 1993)(finding adequacy of representation defeats intervention of right, but\nstating that permissive intervention remained within the discretion of the court which had denied\nthe motion).\nAt least one court, in construing Mass. R. Civ. P. 24Co), has found that a judge \"could\nconsider that the [applicant's] interest was already adequately represented in the action\" among\nother factors. Attorney General v. Brockton, 390 Mass. at 435,456 N.E.2d at 1134. To the\nextent that inadequacy of representation is deemed relevant, the discussion in section I(D)\ndemonstrates that students satisfy this requirement, especially under the lower standard for\npermissive intervention.\n34\n\nA. The Application is _mely.\nThe same factors are analyzed when considering timeliness under Rule 24(b) as under\nRule 24(a)(2). Corcoran, 389 Mass. at 1003, 448 N.E.2d at 1129 (permissive); Teachers\nLocal 1289, 28 Mass. App. Ct. at 413, 551 N.E.2d at 1209 (as of right). Therefore, the\nanalysis and conclusion that the motion is timely for intervention as of rightss also controls\nthe analysis under permissive intervention. In view of all of the factors set forth supra, the\nimportance of the students' participation as separate parties in this case, and the significance\nof their rights at issue, the motion was timely for the purposes of permissive intervention.\nB. The Application Contains Common Questions of Law or Fact.\nThe standard for establishing a common question of law or fact is quite lenient. A\nproposed intervenor need not have a strong nexus of common fact or law to satisfy the\nrequirement under Rule 24(b)(2). Meyer Goldberg, Inc. of Lorain v. Fisher Foods, Inc., 823\nF.2d 159 (6th Cir. 1987). A single common question of law or fact will suffice, despite\nfactual differences between parties. McNeiR v. New York City tlousing Attthority, 719\nF.Supp. 233 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), citing 7A C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, §1924 at 473. The individual students easily satisfy this standard.\nThe questions of law which have been presented and will continue to arise in this case\nnecessarily include legal iss_es which are common, if not identical, to those that the students\nraise in their Complaint in Intervention. See App. 112-14. Questions of the students' rights\nto safety, to freedom from harm, to freedom from unnecessary restraint, to freedom from\ncruel and unusual punishment, to adequate treatment in the least restrictive setting, to\n48 See section I(A), supra.\n35\n\nappropriateeducation,andtocompliancewith DMR regulationsandfederallaw are all at\nissue in the instant case. Most importantly, the rights and obligations set forth in the\nSettlement Agreement will be the fundamental legal determinant of both the contempt motion\nand other enforcement activities in this case. The question of whether DMR, as the licensing\nand regulating authority for programs serving persons with mental retardation in\nMassachusetts, has the right and responsibility to monitor BRI's compliance wi!b state\nregulations despite any informal monitoring provided by Dr. Daignault is central to the\npresent contempt action as well as to virtually all other proceedings in this case. This\nquestion is of utmost concern to the students, as its outcome will implicate their interest in\nadequate monitoring of programs and the treatment they receive.\nIn addition, the question of whether the DMR has failed to enforce its regulations\nforbidding the use of mechanical restraints without first obtaining a substituted judgment\ntreatment plan directly concerns the students. Their rights to freedom from unnecessary\nrestraint, to appropriate behavior treatment, and to adequate treatment in the least restrictive\nsetting are directly implicated by this question.\nIn assessing common questions of law and fact, courts look to see whether intervenors\npresent any arguments that reshape the issues in the case or contribute to its just resolution.\nResolution Trust Corp., 150 F.R.D. at 455. Courts have permitted intervention in cases in\nwhich the intervenors' \"legal arguments will undoubtedly round out the considerations before\n[the] Court.\" Acushnet, 712 F.Supp. at 1024 (allowing intervention for limited purposes).\nPermitting intervention by the students would assist in determining whether BRI has\nconsistently acted within the requirements set forth in the Settlement Agreement, particularly\n36\n\nwith respectto whether the treatment given was the least restrictive treatment possible in\neach individual case, 49 These facts are substantial and not likely to be raised by any other\nparty. The presentation of this information by the individual students is essential, as it is\nclosely related to the common nucleus of facts at issue in this case. Moreover, to date it has\nnot been presented by anyone.\nThe rights of the students are central to the arguments of both DMR and BR1, as both\nentities exist to serve the students. Their disagreement stems from different interpretations of\nhow best to achieve this goal. Intervention by the students can only benefit both parties, as\nthe trial court will be provided with a more complete and individualized description of the\nneeds and desires of the students and will therefore be able to make a more informed\ndecision.\nC. Intervention Will Not Prejudice or Delay the Adjudication of the Parties'\nClaims.\nIn deciding whether to allow permissive intervention, courts place emphasis on any\nprejudice or undue delay that would result from intervention. Courts often combine the\ndiscussion of whether the delay engendered by intervention at this stage of litigation will\nprejudice existing parties with its consideration of undue delay as an element of the\ntimeliness question. See Acushnet, 712 F.Supp. at 1025.\n49 See McNeill, 719 F.Supp. at 250, stating \"it may even be the case that efficiency is\npromoted by intervention, as the proposed plaintiffs' claims may elucidate the peculiar\ndifficulties allegedly visited on tenants by NYCHA poficies\". Contrast Attorney General v.\nBrockton Agricultural Society, 390 Mass. at 436, 456 N.E.2d at 1134, denying permissive\nintervention where \"the underlying issue is one of law that appears to turn on facts that are\nlargely documentary. In such a case, differences in the manner of representation seem less\nlikely to influence the outcome than where there are factual disputes \"\n37\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, 5°and particularly since the contempt trial has\nproceeded, allowing the students to intervene will not delay any pending matter in this case.\nThis Court found no prejudice to the defendant state agency even when intervention was\nsought after a trial was concluded. Sargeant v. Commissioner of Public Welfare, 383 Mass.\n808, 423 N.E.2d. 755 (1981).\nA successful motion to intervene will not open the door for other parties to intervene,\nthereby adding unnecessarily to the length and complexity of the trial. Because there are a\nlimited number of students at BRI, and there are no outside parties who could legitimately\nclaim an interest in the action, this would be the only group of people who would qualify for\npermissive intervention. This case can thus be distinguished from those in which courts deny\nintervention because \"[t]o allow [applicant] to intervene would open the floodgates to\ninnumerable others with the potential for drowning the whole project in a sea of litigation.\"\nU.S.v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 147 F.R.D. 1, 6 (D. Mass. 1993) (case involving\nBoston Harbor cleanup, an enormous project which would impact hundreds of groups).\nThe probate court never even considered the students' request for permissive\nintervention. Its failure to do so, and its implicit denial of their motion to intervene under\nMass. R. Civ. P. 24(b), was an abuse of discretion warranting reversal.\nso See Part I(A), supra.\n38\n\nIlL ABSENT CLASSMFAIBERS ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY PRECLUDED\nFROM INTERVENING IN A PENDING PROCEEDING.\nIt is clear that \"one who is already a classmember [can] intervene in a lawsuit\" if the\nclassmember believes his or her interests are being inadequately represented. Shults v.\nChampion International Corp, 35 F.3._! 1056 (6th Cir. 1994); Gottlieb et al v. Q.T. Wiles, et\nal., 11 F.3d 1004, 1008 (10th Cir. 1993); Diaz v. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, 876\nF.2d 1401, 1405 (9th Cir. 1989); McNeil v. Gulhrie, 945 F.2d 1163, 1167-68 (10th Cir.\n1991); 7B Wright, Miller and Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure ¶1799 (2d Ed. 1986).\nIn fact, intervention is the preferred remedy for a classmember aggrieved by inadequate\nrepresentation; the only other remedy is to bring an independent action, which is more\nexpensive and inconvenient, and less efficient. See McNeil, 945 F.2d at 1167-68. In\naddition, intervention may be the only procedural device by which a classmember can protect\nhis or her right to appeal a decision or settlement that he or she regards as adverse. See\ncases collected in Shults, 35 F.3d 1056 (6th Cir. 1994).\nThe requirement of inadequate representation for the purpose of intervention by a\nclassmember is clearly lower than the requirement of adequate representation that must be\nmet before a class is certified. /d. As the First Circuit pointed out:\nIt is worth noting that 'the adequacy of existing representation is sometimes regarded\nas only a minimal barrier to intervention,' Moosehead San. Dist. v. S.G. Phillips\nCo., 610 F.2d 49, 54 (lst Cir. 1979), and that 'if the applicant shows that the\nrepresentation may be inadequate ... then the court is precluded from finding that the\ninterest is adequately represented. Flynn v. Hubbard, 782 F.2d 1084, 1090 (lst Cir.\n1986)(Coffin, J., concurring)(further citations omitted). Moreover, the burden of\npersuasion that representation is adequate appears to rest on the party opposing\nintervention (citations omitted).\nCaterino v. J. Leo Barry, 922 F.2d 37, 42 (lst Cir. 1990). Where, as here, there is\n39\n\nsubstantiaclonfusion about the identity, role, and loyalty of class counsel, and where the\nnamed student representatives are the incompetent wards of the leaders of the intervenor\ncorporation, the BRI Parents and Friends Association, lne., there is ample reason to conclude\nthat the individual students should be permitted to intervene to protect their separate and\ndistinct interests, even though they may be absent members of a class, just as the parents\nhave been able to participate separately through their own association. The failure of the\nprobate court to analyze or even consider this critical issue of conflict within the student and\nparent class requires reversal of its denial of intervention. Similarly, the lower court's\nassumption that since the students were members of a class of parents and students, there is\nno need to consider the individual students' request for intervention is plainly erroneous and\nshould be reversed.\nIV. TIlE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS NEED APPOINTMENT OF NEXT FRIENDS\nTO BE PROPERLY REPRESENTED IN TillS ACTION.\nThe issue of appointment of next friends is inextricably intertwined with the issue of\nadequacy of representation. All of the students at BRI have significant disabilities and many\nsuffer from severe mental impairments. They are vulnerable to abuse and neglect and need\nassistance in proiecting their legal rights. All of the students have been deemed incapable of\nconsenting to treatment and in need of a legal guardian. Because of the limited authority of\nthe guardians with respect to aversive treatment under Massachusetts law and the potential\nconflict between guardians and their wards, the existence of the guardians does not obviate\nthe need for the appointment of next friends for the individual students or the importance of\ntheir separate participation in the equity proceeding. In fact, given the critical importance of\nthe issues raised in this case for each of the students, it is essential that every student have an\n40\n\nindependent next friend who is extensively familiar with the individual needs and preferences\nof each student, who is free of all conflicts, and who is capable of asserting the individual\nrights of the student in this proceeding.\nRule 17(b) of the Mass. R. Cir. P. governs the appointment of a next friend or\nguardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person, s* A next friend is authorized to sue\nas the person's representative. The rule abolished the traditional distinction between the\nfunctions of guardian ad litem and next friend and sets forth the guidelines governing the\nappointment of a legal representative, The provisions of the rule flow from the general duty\nof the court to protect the interests of infants and incompetents in cases before the court.\nThus, a court typically appoints a next friend to assert the rights of those persons who cannot\ndo so themselves. In the context of this case, the relevant question is who is the most\nappropriate person to protect the individual student's interests, particularly with respect to the\nissues raised in the pending equity action and resolved, at least in substantial part, by the\nSettlement Agreement.\nThe decision as to whether or not to appoint a next friend or guardian ad litem rests\n5_ The rule provides that:\nWhenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general\nguardian, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on\nbehalf of the infant or incompetent person. If an infant or incompetent person does not\nhave a duly appointed representative, he may sue by next friend or by a guardian ad\nlitem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person\nnot otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper\nfor the protection of the infant or incompetent person.\nThe Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure mirror their federal counterparts in several\nsignificant respects and have customarily been interpreted with reference to federal rules\ndecisions. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c).\n41\n\nwithin thesounddiscretionof the court and will not be disturbed unless there has been an\nabuse of its authority. Gardner v. Parson, 874 F.2d 131 (3d Cir. 1989); N.O.v. Callahan,\n110 F.R.D. 637 (D.Mass. 1986); Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Center Inc. v.\nMelton, 689 F.2d 281 (lst Cir. 1982). See also U.S.v. 30.64Acres of Land, 795 F.2d 796,\n804 (9th Cir. 1986). But this discretion is not boundless and must be exercised with careful\nattention to the role of and potential conflict with the existing guardian, particularly where\nstate law imposes limitations on the authority or responsibility of a guardian. Adelman v.\nGraves, 747 F.2d 986, 989 (5th Cir. 1984) (district court erroneously denied mother's\npetition for appointment as next friend in action against mental hospital because the court\nfailed to consider whether the incompetent son's interests were adequately protected by his\nexisting guardian).\nUnder Rule 17(b), a court generally is cautious about appointing a next friend or\nguardian ad litem in an action where the infant or incompetent person is already represented\nby someone who is considered appropriate. See N.O.v. Callohan, 110 F.R.D. 637 (court\nrefused to appoint next friend for one of named plaintiffs in class action by inpatients at state\nmental facility because patient already had duly appointed guardian and guardian had the\nauthority to act in the litigation). However, because the protection of infants and\nincompetents is the goal of Rule 17(b), the trial judge has a duty to consider whether the\nincompetent person will be adequately represented without appointment of a next friend.\nFederal and state courts have repeatedly affirmed their power to determine that the general\ninterests of the child or incompetent would best be represented not by a general\nrepresentative, such as a parent or guardian, but by a guardian ad litem or next friend.\n42\n\nThesecourtshaveconsistentlyrecognizedtheirpowertoappointanextfriendwhenit\nappearsthat:(1) theinfantor incompetent person's general representative has interests which\nmay conflict with those of the person he or she is supposed to represent, or (2) the\nrepresentative is unable, unwilling, or refuses to act on behalf of the infant or incompetent.\nCases provide numerous examples where the existing representative, while generally\nadequate, has a conflict of interest with the infant or incompetent that necessitates the\nappointment of a guardian ad litem. Courts are concerned with conflicting financial\ninterests. See lloffert v. General Motors Corporation, 656 F.2d 161, reh'g, denied, 660\nF.2d 497 (5th Cir. 1981)(question of how to apportion tort suit's settlement proceeds\nbetween father and son created a potential conflict of interest, which merited the appointment\nof a guardian ad litem). However, courts have also found conflicting interests in other\ninstances. See M.S.v. Wemzers, 557 F.2d 170 (Sth Cir. 1977) (conflict exists where suit\nitself seeks to advance interests of child over those of parent); 526 C. Wright & A. Miller,\n§1570. The facts and decision in Iloracek v. Exon, 357 F.Supp. 71, 74 (D.Neb. 1973) are\nparticularly instructive here. in that case, a group of mentally retarded residents represented\nby their parents, brought an action against a state institution. The court identified a conflict\nof interest between the parents and children and appointed a guardian ad litem. \"While the\nparents in all good conscience may desire one remedy, or a specific type or style of\n52 In Wenners, an infant brought suit challenging the state's parental notification laws\nconcerning contraceptives. The court noted, \"When there is a potential conflict between a\nperceived parental responsibility and an obligation to assist the court in achieving a just and\nspeedy determination of the action, the parents have no right to act as guardians ad litem.\" 557\nF.2d. at 175. Because the action focused on the issue of parental notification, the Eighth Circuit\nreasoned that parents would be hard-pressed to serve as impartial representatives willing to\nvigorously pursue their child's interests in this claim.\n43\n\ntreatment for their children, it would not necessarily be in the best interests of the children.\"\n357 F.gupp. at 74.\nThere is a particularly compelling reasol, to appoint a legal representative when\nvindication of fundamental rights or participation in a legal proceeding would otherwise be\nimpossible. Access to the courts by aggrieved persons should not be unduly limited,\nparticularly as in this case, where an incompetent person raises allegations of violations of\nher rights attributable to his custodians. Adelman, 747 F.2d at 986; Seide v. Prevost, 536\nF.Supp. 1121, 1132 (S.D.N.Y. 1982); Child v. Beame, 412 F.Supp. 593, 599 (S.D,N.Y.\n1976).\nA recent federal court decision in a similar case involving the authority of guardians\nto determine the rights and legal positions of their wards, particularly with respect to\nclassmembership, is instructive. The court's analysis is relevant here:\nIndeed, legal authority supports the propofition that minors and other persons\nunder a legal disability retain the rights of other citizens and that parents and\nguardians lack the power to waive the fundamental rights of their children and\nwards. Thus, a minor or ward has standing to sue to enjoin violations of his\nor her constitutional rights despite the parent's or guardian's consent to the\npractices or conditions being challenged. See Milonas v. Williams, 691 F.2d\n931,943 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 967 (1988) (the commitment\nof mentally retarded adults upon application by a parent or guardian is to be\nconsidered involuntary); Thomas S. by Brooks v. Morrow, 601 F.Supp. 1055\n(W.D.N.C. 1984), aft'd, 781 F.2d 367 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. deniedsub, nora.\nKirk v. Thomas S. by Brooks, 476 U.S. 1124 (1986) (young man with\nretardation whose court-appointed guardian had consented to his admission to a\nstate institution had standing to sue the Secretary of the North Carolina\nDepartment of Human Resources and his guardian for violating his right to\nminimally adequate habilitation and unnecessarily restraining his liberty).\nAs for the Arlington residents whose guardians have the authority \"to protect\ntheir well-being and legal interest,\" even if this clause is interpreted to\nauthorize the guardian to bring civil litigation on behalf of the ward, such\nauthority cannot be exclusive. Bonnie S. v. Altman, Civ. No. 87-3709, slip.\n44\n\nop.at5 (D.N.J. April 19,1988)(quotingS.BRAKEL, ET AL., THE\nMENTALLY DISABLEDAND THELAW 437(3ded. 1985)(\"[m]odern\nauthoritiesgenerallyregardtherequirementthataguardiansueor besuedfor\ntheincompetenpt ersonasaprotectionof theinterestsof theincompetent\npersonrather than _S a limitation on hi_ or her capacity to institute suite\"\n(emphasis added by the court)).\nPeople First of Tennessee, No. 92-2213-MI/V, 1995 WL* (Sept. 27, 1995).\nIn the instant case, the individual students are already \"represented\" by their parents\nor guardians. However, the Court has previously determined that these students are not\nadequately represented, at least for the purposes of the equity action, since it has appointed\nseparate counsel to represent the students' interests in this proceeding, albeit without either\ncertifying a class under Rule 23 or indicating that it was in any way acting under Rule 17.\nIn so doing, it has implicitly acknowledged at least the potential for a conflict between the\nparents and the students. Therefore, it should not rely on the existence of these guardians to\nexclusively protect the students' interests, particularly where the guardians lack the authority\nunder Massachusetts law to make the very decisions (consent to aversive treatment) which\nare at stake in this litigation. Rather, the lower court should have exercised its authority to\nappoint next friends for each student with respect to the equity proceeding. See Adehnan,\n747 F.2d 986; Chrissy F. v. Missouri Dept. of Welfare, 883 F.2d 25 (8th. Cir. 1989); In the\nMatter of Chicago Rock Island & Pacific R.R. Co., 788 F.2d 1280, 1282 (7th Cir. 1986) (\"If\nthere were some reason to think that [the plaintiff's] mother would not represent his interests\nadequately, the district court would, we may assume, be required (and certainly would be\nempowered) to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent him.\"); C. Wright & A. Miller,\n§1570. Its failure to do so, in circumstances where the existing guardians are specifically\nprecluded by state law from making decisions concerning aversive treatment, was an abuse of\n45\n\ndiscretion.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, this Court should reverse the lower court's denial of the\nindividual students' motion to intervene and for the appointment of their guardianship counsel\nas their next friend. The individual students should be allowed to participate in the retrial, if\nany, of BRI's contempt motion. In any event, the individual students should be afforded\nintervenor status in all subsequent proceedings in this case, including remedial activities\npursuant to any decision on the contempt motion.\nTHE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS,\nTHROUGH GUARDIANSHIP COUNSEL AND\nNEXT FRIENDS\nBy their attorneys,\nCenter for Public Representation\n246 Walnut Street\nNewton, MA. 02160\n(617) 965-0776\nBBO #448440\nRepresentatives of the Guardianship Counsel:\nRichard Ames\n90 Canal Street\nBoston, MA. 02114-2022\n(617) 742-4300\nJohn Coyne\n558 Pleasant Street\nNew Bedford, MA. 02740\n(508) 990-3738\n46",

Whether the trial court's denial of a Motion to be\nAppointed as Next Friend of each individual student at the Behavioral\nResearch Institute, Inc. submitted pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.Pro. 17(b) and\nM.G.i.. Chapter 201, §37 filed by counsel appointed to represent those\nstudents in guardianship and substittited judgment proceedings was an\nabuse of discretion.\n2. Whether tile individual students at the Behavioral Research\nInstitute. Inc. are entitled to intel_,ene in a Complaint for Contempt when\nthey are already parties _4thin a class in that action.\n3. Whether the individual students at the Behavioral Research\nInstitute, Inc. should be permitted to intervene in a Complaint for\nContempt _vhen they are already parties in that action.\nI1. Statement of the Case\nThe action in which guardianship colmsel seek to be appointed as\nnext fiiend of each individual student and to intervene is a Complaint for\nContempt filed by the Behavioral Research ln_itute, Inc. (\"BRI\") on\nSeptember 2, 1993. The Complaint for Contempt alleges that the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation (\"DMW') violated the terms and\nprovisions of a settlement agreement entered by all parties to an action filed\nby BRI in 1986 against the Massachusetts Office for Children (\"OFC\") and\n\nitsdirector. At that time, OFC was the state regulatory agency responsible\nfor the cetlificatiou and liceusure of BRl. That function was later\ntransferred to the Depa_lment of Mental llealth and has since been given to\nthe Department of Mental Retardation.\nGuardianship counsel filed a Motion to Be Appointed Next Friend\n(App. 137), Motion to Intervene (App.79) and a Complaint in Intervention\n(App.86) in the Probate Cotul on March 3 I, 1994 which were apparently\nlater refiled on June 17, 1994 in an effort to comply with Rule 9A\n(Sup.Ct.) The Complaint in Intelx'ention demands relief_vhich has limited\nrelationship, if any, to the Complaint for Contempt filed by BRI against\nDMR.\nOn May 18, 1995, the court (l.aStaiti, J.) denied both the Motion to\nbe Appointed Nex'l Friend and the Motion to Intervene. (App.241) Ou May\n25, 1995, a Notice of Appeal was docketed relative to the denial ofboth\nmotions. (App.245)\nThe proposed intervenors appealed to a Single Justice (Perretta, J.)\nof the Appeals Court pursnant to G.L.c.231, §118, para. I, requesting\ninterlocutory, review of the denial and a stay of the contempt trial. \"l]ley\nv,ere denied relief on June 5, 1995. (App.245)\nOn June 6, 1995, guardianship counsel filed a petition in the\nSupreme Judicial Court pursuant to G.L.c. 211 §3 seeking a stay of the\ncontempt trial pending a report of the denial of the motions to tile fidl\nbench from a Single Justice (Abrams, J.). The request _vas denied on Juue\n21, 1995. (App.250)\nGuardia_ship counsel filed a petition with a Single Justice of the\nAppeals Court {Laurence, J.) which asked that the clerk of the trial court\nbe required to assemble the record for tile taking of an appeal to the full\n2\n\nbench of the Appeals court. An order was entered on July 25, 1995\nallo_,ing the petition. (App.254)\nGuardianship cotmsel moved for Direct Appellate Review which\nwas allowed by this Court on September 10, 1995.\n!11. Statement of Facts\nBR1 is an institute which provides treatnlent programs for\nindividuals vdth extreme mental disabilities. BRI opera*es a school for\nthese students in Providence, Rhode Island and several group boules in\nMassachusetts. BRI employs the use of behavior modification to treat the\nstudents. One of the nlore controversial methods ofbehavior modification\nis the use ofaversive teclmiques.\nIn 1985 wlfile OFC still had the responsibility for regulating BRI,\nBRI and parents of students at BRI filed a suit in equity against OFC,\nalleging bad faith on tile part of the agency in executing its regulatory\nduties over BRI. The paramount concelll ill the suit was the fact that tile\nDirector of OFC had issued a directive which resulted in tile disruption of\nstudents' treatment programs and that tile students were suffering\nirreparable harm as a result of that order.\nOil June 4, 1986, Judge Rotenberg issued a preliminary certification\nof a Class consisting of Students at BRI and their Parents for the purposes\nof issuing a Preliminary Injunction. (App.41) Attorneys Marc Perliu and\nMax Volterra were appointed by the court to represent the \"potential class\nof all students at BRI\" on or about April 29, 1986. (App.72)\nOn the same day, Judge Rotenberg issued a Prelimiuary injtnlctioll\nagainst OFC after having held four days ofevidentiary hearings. (Supp.\n3\n\nApp. 1)1. 111e coutl entered extensive findings ill support of the Preliminary\nInjunction. {Supp.App.3) lu describiug the nature of the case as being\n\"utterly tmique\", Judge Roteuberg found:\n...it iuvolves the care and treatment of a select, special needs class\nof desperately afflicted students, many of_vhom sttffer from autism,\nbrain damage, psychosis, developmental disability, mental\nretardation and severe behavioral disorders, and all of whom are\ngrievously tueutally ill. \"llleir illness is commonly characterized\nby aberrant behavior, iuchtdiug violeuce toward others, self-abuse,\ndestntction of property, danger to themselves and others and, in\nsbo_t, behavior that it is so abnormal is in many cases life-\nthreatetfing by nature. (Supp.App.3)\nThe court fitrtlter found that BRI employed the use of rewards far\n,._ore than aversive techniques alld that aversives were used \"in lieu of anti\npsychotic medication and other more restrictive procedures, such as\nseclusion and electric-shock.\" (Supp.App. 15) The Court attributed\ninstances of students who had become incoherent and had nmtilated\nthemselves to a point where the it_juries were life threatetfiog to the\ncessation of the students' treatment programs under the direction of OFC.\n(Supp.App. 16) The Court noted the marked improvetuent in such students\n_hen their treatment programs were resumed (Supp.App. 17)\nOFC appealed the preliminary injunction to a Single Justice\n(Greaney, C.J.) of the Appeals Court. That petition was denied on July 30,\n1986 (Supp. App.31 ) Attorney Perliu argued as counsel for the students.\n(Supp.34)\n1Supp App. refers toa Supplemental Appendix filed bythe Student Members v,.hovcere\nnot co.

In\nDecember 12, 1986 a proposed settlement agreement was filed _,,ith tile\ncoral. (App.51) \"llle same day, after hearing, tile court entered an order\ncertifying the class action and made findings in support of the order. (App.\n49-50) Specifically, tile Court found that:\n(I.) the Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable;\n(2.) there are quesiiomls oflaw and tacl which are common to all\nmembers of the Class;\n(3.) the claims of the representative parties, Leo Soucy, Brendon\nSoucy, Peter Biscardi, and P.J.

(App.49-50)\nThe Order Certif)_ing Class Action was never appealed.\nThe Students had participated in tile negotiations ,Milch lead to the\nSettlement Agreement through their counsel, Attonleys Perlin and\nVolterra. All parties to the action, including the students, entered the\nSettlenient Agreenlent which was later approved by the court. (App.51-64)\nBoth Attorneys Perlin and Volterra executed the Agreement as Counsel for\nthe BRi clients. (App.64) A separate attorney, Robert A. Sherman,\nexecuted the Agreement as cotmsel for the Class of All Students at BRI,\nTheir Parents and Guardians.

Two students and their parents or\nguardians had submitted written objections to the agreement. 'l]ley were\nthe only class members to object to the proposed Settlement Agreement.\n(App.66) The objectors 3appeared before the court on January 7, 1986\nthrough their counsel, Steven J. Schwartz, Esq. and were beard. The Cottrt\nrejected the arguments as raised by the objectors and fitrtber noted that\nAttorney Schwartz had previously filed an appearance in the court on\nbehalf of various organizations that advocated the closure of BRi and\ntermination of its program, a position v,]fich differed markedly from that of\nthe objectors he represented on that date. (App.68)\nFollowing the approval ofthe Settlentent Agreement, a period of\nrelative calm continued m_til September, 1993 when BRI filed a Contplaint\nfor Contempt against Philip Campbell, Commissioner ofDMR. DMRhad\n2Although: not listed separatelyin the Table ofContents, the findings can be found in\nthe Appendix at pages 65 -70 following the Settlement Agreement.\n3One of the objectors had been discharged from BRI priortothe hearing and the court\nwas disturbed at counsel for his failure to inform the courtof this.

BRI allegcd in its complaint that DMR had violated the terms of the\nSettlenlent Agr_;ement (Sul)p.App.40) in a nunlber of ways and of acting ill\nbad faith. BRI clainled, among other things, that DMR was using tile\ncertification process to close BRI, that i)MR had failed to submit to\nmediation with the coull Moltitor, that DMR made specious and\ndefamatol 3' allegations and accusations about P,RI, hired an unqualified and\nbiased team to review/IRI, made the treatmettt decisions for IlRI studez2ts,\ndecezlified BRI, and engaged in bad faith. (Supp.App.99)\nOn September 25, 1993, Attorneys Per/in and Volterra filed\nmotions for leave to withdraw from tile contempt action. (App.71 ) A\ncourt order entered on November 8, 1993, appointing Attorneys Paul\nCataldo and C. Michele l)orsey as successor counsel to \"the class of the\nstudents \"4, (App.74.) Within that same otder, the Coutl fotmd that \"This\nclass of individuals previously represented by Attonleys Perlin and Voherra\ncontinttes to have tile most vital interest ill the process axld outcome of any\nlitigation that occurs in the above cited matter, given the vuhlerability that\nthe class suffers due to severe developmental disabilities and/or mental\nillness?' (App.74)\nNo one objected to or appealed from the order appointing\nAttorneys Cataldo and Dorsey. Althoogh neither were members of the\nCommittee for Public Counsel Service (\"CPCS\") list of attorneys\napproved for appointment to mental health cases, both received waivers for\nsuch. Guardianship cotmsel has continued to point to the fact that\n4As ,,viiibe discussed later, reference tothe \"class ofstudents\"in thiscase technically is\none tothe student members of the Class of All Students at BRI, their Parents and\nGuardians.\n7\n\nAttorneys Cataldo and Dorsey are not lawyers on the CPCS list in an\napparent eflb_l to discredit them and to continue a controversy sun-otmding\nthat issue x_hich has already been deterulined by the trial court and which\nwas upheld by a single justice of the Appeals Court. In April, 19)3, the\nCommittee for Ihlblic Counsel Service had challenged the Probate Court\njudge (LaStaiti, J.) for making appointments ofattorueys outside the\napproved list in cases involving guardianships of students at BRI. CPCS\nwas denied relief by the Single Justice (Kass, J.) vdlo detenuined that the\ntrial judge could make such appointments if she found exceptional\ncircumstances and that the judge had done so in that case. (Supp.App. 114)\nThe Probate Con t judge had found, among other things, that\"'i'a histoly of\nactive disapproval and opposition to some of the treatment methods florins\nofaversive therapy) employed by the institution (Behavioral Research\nInstitute) where the wards resided gave concern that the particular lawTers\ndesignated by CPCS might be disabled from giving disinterested advice aud\nrepresentation. (Supp.App. 114- I 15) The Single Justice found that papers\nfiled in oppositiou to the CPCS petition for review suggested that the trial\njudge's concern about possible bias from the CPCS designees was not\nentirely speculative. (Supp.App. 115)\nGuardianship counsel are the attorneys who represent individual\nstudents at BRI in substituted judgment proceedings and in guardianships.\nThese attorneys, _vho refer to themselves collectively as \"guardianship\ncotmser', seek to be appointed as next friend of each individual student for\nthe purpose of intervening in the contempt action. It is noteworthy that a\nnumber of guardianship counsel represent more than one student and yet\nseek to be appointed as next friend for each of the students whom they\nrepresent. (App.88-103) The thrust of the motions filed by guardianship\n8\n\ncounseilsthat after guardianship counsel have been appointed as next\nfriend of each individual student, they will iuterveue, if permitted by this\ncorn1, in the contempt action which was heard in tile Bristol Probate Cotul\nin Jtme and July, 1995. (A judgment in that matter entered on October 6,\nIg95 and is currently the subject era number of appeals which are pending\nbefore this Court.) Attorney Steven Schwartz would then se,ve as the legal\nrepresentative of all \"next friends\" of BRI students in this matter. Two of\nthe existing guardianship counsel, John Co)qle and Richard Ames, would\nact as the legal representatives for all guardianship counsel, providing a\nliaison to Attonley SchwaJlz. (App.84)\nThrough this legal maneuvering, Attonleys Cataldo and l)orsey\nwould effectively be replaced as counsel for tilt student members of the\nClass. Both the Motion to be Appointed as Next Friend and tile Motion to\nIntervene actually seek to replace counsel for the Student Members ofthe\nClass chosen by the cout_ _ith counsel selected by guardianship counsel.\nEssentially, guardianship counsel's motions are substantively motions to\nreconsider the appointments of Attorneys Cataldo and Dorsey.\nIV. Argument\nA. The trial court acted within its discretion when it denied the\nMotion to be Appointed as Next Friend of each individual student at the\nBehavioral Research Institute, inc. filed by counsel al_poiuted to:epresent\nthose students in guardianship_ and substituted judgment l_roceediug_.\nI. The Student Members of the Class Have Already Been\nProtected by the Court's Order Appointing Attorneys Cataldo and Dorsey\nas Counsel and by the Appointment of Guardians for Each Individual\nStt,dent.\n9\n\nJ'he threshold issue in this case is whether tile trial corn1 committed\nan abuse of discretion when it denied the Motion to Appoint Next Friend\nfor tile Individual Students. Ira next friend is not to be appointed for an\nindividual student, then tile issue of intezvenltion is moot because there is no\nstaading for guardianship counsel to briag such a ruotion. F.ach student at\nBRI has a conrt appointed guardian who is in most instances a parent.\n(App.2,12) The trialjudge found that since each stl,dent had a gtnardian and\nv,'a._further directly represented by cotmsel allpoiated to represent the\nSttndent Members ofthe Class independent of the Parents and Guardians,\nthey were adequately protected and aplmintment ofaext friend would be\nredundanlt. {App.242-243)\nGuardiauship cotmsel relies upon Mass.R.Civ.Pro. 17(b) in support\nof their motion to be appointed as next fiJelld. Mass.R.Civ.Pro. 17(b)\nprovides for the appointment ofa aex-t friend or guardian ad litem or an\ninfant or an incompetent person as follows:\nWhenever an i.fa.t or incompetent person has a\nreprese.tati,'e, s.ch as a ge.eral guardian, co.set'vator, or other\nlike fidueiary, the representati_,e may sue or defe.d opt behalf of\nthe infa.t or i.compete.t persoa. If a. infa.t or i.compete.t\nperso, does .or have a dtd)' appointed representative, he may sue\nb)' .ext frietM or b)' guardian ad l/tern. The Court shall appoi.t\nthe guardian ad litem for an i.fant or #tcompete.t person not\notherwise represented in an action or shall/hake sach order as it\ndeems proper for the protectiolt of the infant or incontpetent\nperso.. (emphasis added)\nTile rule grants discretion to the court in entering an order it deems\nproper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person. Ti_e order of\nthis court dated November 8, 2993, appointing Attorueys Cataldo and\n10\n\nDorsey to represent the interests of all th,_ \"Class of Students \"5 at BRI in\nthe cot_tempt provides tlJe apl)ropri_le l)ro(eclion tbr the studetJls at I?,RI,\nThe cot,l has the authority to detemfine whether or ,ol In apl)oittt ,_t3ext\nfiiend or guardian ad litem _lhin its sound discretion. N.O.v. CYdlahals\n110 F.R.D. 637, 648 (D. Mass. 1986) The trial court has exercised such\ndiscretion as supported by its b'indmgs attd Orders on A[otiott to 1lTthdrm¢\nof /_lax l'olterra. Esq. and Marc Perlin. Esq. dated November 8, 1993\n(l.aStaiti, J.) _shere the Court stated \"this court must remain vigilant to\nensure that this class is represented by counsel who are as intlepetldeut and\nobjective as can be from the influence of any state agency.\"\nAs a general rule. the court v_illnot appoint a Ilext fiiend for a\nperson _11o has duly appointed representative. Callahan at 049. Unless\nthe interest of the guardian aJld the _,_ard in a case are conflicting, courts\nate reluctant to appoint a next friend for a _ard v,ho is already adequately\nrepresented it| an action. _[atlst_r v. Prftd( I01 Mass. 60.61 (1869)\nAlthough no such actual conflict has been alleged _s4thin guardianship\ncotmsers motion, nor are there facts to support such an allegation, the\nstudents are already adequately represented and protected should such a\nconflict arise. It v,as, in fact, in recognition that a potential conflict might\narise between the students and their parents or guardians, that lead the\ncourt to appoint independent counsel for the Student Members of the Class\nin 1986.\n5Gnardianship counsel maintain that nosuch class exists. However. this is contradicted\nbythe Order Certifying Class Action entered on December 12, 1986which made the\nrequisite findings necessary underMassR.Civ.Pro, 23(b) (App.49-50) It isclear from\nthe proceedings from 1986topresent that any reference tothe \"Class of Students\" refers\ntothe Student Mentbers of the Classof Students atBRI, their Parents and Friends.\nGuardianship counsel attempt todistort this nomenclature as demonstrating some\ndeficiency inthe certification ofthe Class.\n11\n\nYet, gtJardianship counsel rely almost exclusively upon case law in\nx_hich the possibility for conflict between the interest of the ward and legal\nrepresentatives were found and in which the interest of the ward remained\npotentially unprotected. While tile court must consider whether it is\nuecessaD' to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interest of an infant\nor aa incompetent person, the court is not required to make such an\nappointment ifit feels that the interests ofthe infant or incompetent person\nare othel_'ise protected. Adelma, v (:.rares, 747 F.2d 986, 989 (5tb Cir.\n1984) Ilere, the coot1, a;liculated its recognition for the needs ofthe\nstudents to be protected both ill its order appointirJg Attorneys Cataldo and\nI)orsey (App.74) and in its denial ofthe Motion to Be Appoitrted Next\nFriend (App.241-244). \"I11eCorot recognized both the potential for conflict\nand the vulnerability of the students. \"llle court has already provided\nprotection by the apl_ointment of independent counsel for the student body\nat la;ge (within the Class) as well as the appointment of a guardian and of\nan attorney for each individual student. (App.2,14)\nIn At.S.v. Wermers, cited by guardianship counsel, a minor\nbrought an action for declaratory judgment regarding the policy of the\ncounty to deny contraceptives to minors. Once the court recognized the\npotential conflict between the minor and her parents, it was not an abuse of\ndiscretion for the court to find that the minor needed a guardian ad litem in\norder to proceed. 557 F.2d 170, 175 (8th Cir. 1977) In this case, the court\nlong ago recognized the potential conflict between tile parents or guardians\nand the students, and made provisions for protecting the students interests\nby providing independent counsel within the Class and by appointing each\nindividual student an independent attorney for the guardianship and\nsubstituted judgment proceedings. In other words, the protection found\n12\n\nnecessary ill ll'er,,er and in other cases cited by guardianship counsel has\nalready been provided here. Guardia_tship counsel suggest that the Facts\nand decision ill tloracek v. Ge,eral Motors Corporation, 356 F.Supp. 7 I\n(D.Neb. 1973) suppoxl their proposition that they be appointed as next\nfriend for each individual student, lloracek involved a civil rights action\nbrought by parents on behalf of their children who were residents at a state\nhome for tile mentally retarded. The court recognized the potential for a\nconflict.\nWhile the parents in all good conscience may desire one remedy, or\nspecific type or style oftreatment for their children, it would not\nnecessarily be in the best interests ofthe children. Therefore, it\nseems to me that a discreet course would be to provide for the\nappoiflt of a guardian ad litem _llo would not displace the pare_ts\nas representatives ofthe plaintiffs but would be alert to recognize\npotential and actual differences in positions asserted by tile parents\nand positions that need to be asserted on behalfofthe plaintiffs.\nld. at 74\n\"lhe court in [[pzTacek did much x_hat the court has done in this case since\n1986 _vhich is to recognize tile potential for conflict and provide protection\nso that the interests of the students will be protected.\n2. The Stodents Are At Greater Risk from Conflict of Interest\nUnder tlle _Pr_osaq_JbbyI Guardial_ship_ Counsel.\nIndeed, the potential for conflict between tile individual students\nand guardianship counsel, if appointed next friend, would be heightened by\ntheir proposal. Guardianship counsel, if successful in their motion, inteod\nto proceed through Attorney Schwartz as the legal representative of each\nnext friend, if one student through his uext friend takes a particular\npositiun regarding an issue that is in direct conflict with the position of\n13\n\n,m_+th,..'t ',tud_.'ltt t,l_.'ll thlt>ll_h hi,, II_+'\\t IIIt+'llll. int., diluillt_h* li_l -X.tllllllL\"_\nlrh.'lld'+, [', li;lu_lll '.',lth pOh.'llthll ,,.'t_llllH ;rod _,,uhl ,,ut',_.'tml,, l_ ,.'w_luwtd\n_.l)lllil_,lll_ _illhlltl]ll i_t_l¢llli;lll _,_lli',t.'>+ _,'+h,,+'ll +t!ll;lldi,lll_+hi I) _.tltlll,¢l i_\n<i]+ptillttcd ,I', ll¢\\t trwrid h)i ll)lilt,.

The extreme mental disabilities of the\nstudents at BRI render them both fragile and vulnerable. Considering the\nbellicose history of this ten year controversy, the com_ was well within its\ndiscretion when it sought to provide protection for the students by persons\nwho were trnly independent. \"llowever wortl_y and higlHninded the\nmotives of'next friends' may be, they illevitably run the risk ofmaking the\nactual [party] a pawn to be manipulated on a chess board larger than his\no_11 case.\" Chrtss_b] v.

It would have been inappropriate for the trial\njudge to approve a proposal that gnardianship counsel engage Attorney\nSchwartz in light of his previous involvement in this matter. The fact that\nguardianship counsel made this reqnest provides insight, reinforcing the\ncourt's contintJing concern about independence.\n3. BRI Students Are Well Protected In Several Wa_s_.\nGuardianship counsel point to the vulnerability and disability of the\nindMdual students as reasons which require that they be appointed as next\nfriend. However, tbis court has ensured protection of the students by\nseveral means. Each individual student is appointed an attorney who\nrepresents him or her in individual substituted judgment proceedings. All\nof the students at BR! have been appointed a legal guardian. In addition,\nthe parents of BRl students have actively participated in proceedings dating\nback to the original action filed in 1986. (App.241-244) A guardian ad\n15\n\nlitem,Bettina Briggs, was appointed in the oliginal action and has acted in\nthat capacity to this date. \"ll]e Court Monitor provides vigilance for tile\ncourt and is mandated to report to the court any issue siguificant to the\nhealth, safety arid well-being of the stndents. Filrally, the coun has\nprovided legal representation to the Student members of the Class since\nApril, 1986.\nThe students, therefore, have been well represented in both legal\nactions _vhicb effect them as individuals and in actions which effect the\ngeneral student body of BRI.\nit is important to remember the fact that this is a contempt action\n_bich relates to alleged violations ofthe settlement agreement entered in\nthe original equity action filed in 1986. lu that 1986 equity action, the\nstudents were represented independently as a part of the Class by order of\nthe court. There is no reason to suggest that the students who continue to\nbe represented independently as Members of the Class are not well\nprotected in artaction derived from the original equity action. As the trial\njudge noted, the contempt action does not deal with issues related to the\nindividual treatment plans.\n\"-Treatment Issues are separately litigated inthe Substituted\nJudgment Proceedings in the individual Guardianship case.\n-Treatment Decisions, with reference to aversive-therapies,\nparticularly Level 111aversives, including GED are strenuously litigated in\nthe Guardianship proceedings and such decisions will not be part of the\nContempt Action brought by BRI against DMR.\" (App.241)\nIt is more likely that the Class would be harmed by the\nappointment ofne_ friends by the convolution of issues and conflict\n16\n\nbetween next friends that likely would take place. The interests and issues\nof the individual students which guardiauship counsel seek to advauce are\nappropriately addressed withi,i the substituted judgment hearings.\nB. The individual students at BRI are not entitled to intervene in a\nComplaiut for Contemp! when they are already.parties within a class in that\naction.\n1. \"_le Studeuts At BRI Are Presentl.v A_P_a_B3,\"1\"o\"llOs_Ac!io!l AsA\nClass\nGnardianship counsel claim that the individual students should be\npermitted to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.Pro\n24(a). They assert that the students have never been fonoally afforded\nparty status in this matter which they claim directly effects the fights of\nthose students. Guardianship counsel appear to claim tbat no class was\npermanently certified, that the class effectively does not exist and tile\nattorneys appointed to represent the class apparently have uo clients to\nrepresent under this argument. This argnment ignores the history ofthe\ncase dating back to the origiual equity action in which the Class was\npreliminary certified for the puq_ose of the issuance of preliminary\ninjunctive relief and later given permanent certification as discussed earlier.\n( See pages 4-6 infra) The prequisites for a class action may be tound in\nMass.R.Civ.Pro.23(a).\n( I) The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable,\n(2) There are questions of law or fact common to the class,\n(3) The claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical al ofthe claims or defenses of the class, and\n(4) The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect\nthe interest of the class.\n17\n\nAll of these prerequisites were met by tile Order Certifying Class Action\n_vhich was entered after hearing on December 12, 1986 and which was\nnever appealed (App.49) In addition, the Order fulfilled tile requirements\nunder Mass.R.Civ.Pro.23(b) which arc necessary for a class action to be\nmaintained. Specifically, Judge Rotenberg found that the questions of law\nand fact common to the Class predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members and a class action is superior to other available\nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy between\nthe parties. (App.49-50)\nMore receJ_tly, when addlessing the Molion to be Appoinlcd Next\nFriend, the trial judge restated that the students \"are already a patly to this\naction by virtue of their membership in the PlaintiffClass - \"l_le Students'\nrights under the Scttle,ucnt Agreement will be enforced as a Class.\"\n(App.243}\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that the Students have not\nfidly participated in the contempt proceeding as parties. The Students have\nfiled pleadings, appeared and argued before the court on various matters\nincluding the trial itself and attended mediation sessions held by the court\nappointed mediator. No other party to this action has questioned the party\nstatus of the Students who have been accorded the full rights of a party\nsince 1986. The Students at all times have been treated separately by the\ncourt and by all other parties, including the Parents and Guardians. In\nshort, it is only guardianship comlsel who deny the party status of the\nStudents.\n18\n\nC. The Individual Students Cannot Intervene as a Matter of Right\nUnder Mass.lLCiv.Pro. 24(a){2)\nThe individual students have failed to meet the requirements of\nMass.lLCiv.Pro. 24(aX2) to intervene as a matter ofright. To do so, the\nfollowing nmst be affimlatively shown:\nI. The application is timely;\n. Tile mtervenor possesses all interest relating to ttle\nproperty or transaction which is the subject of the\naction....;\n. Tile iutetwenor is so situated that the dispositioa of the\naction may as a particular matter intpair or intpede his\nability to protect that interest...; and\n. Tile applicant's interest is not adequately represented b),\nexisting parties..\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) mirrors the words of the\nMassachusetts rule and may be considered for guidance. All four (4)\nrequirements of the rule must be satisfied before an application to intervene\nis allowed. Mcwflmver Developutent Corp. v. Town of Demsis\n11 Mass. App. Ct. 630(1981).\na. The Application for Intervention is Not Timely.\nThe application for intervention is not timely. Guardianship counsel\nare well acquainted with the Judgment that approved the Settlement\nAgreement entered on January 7, 1987 because it is that document which\ndefines many ofthe rights of the students as parties to the agreement. This\nincludes the requirement for certain protection for the students through the\n19\n\ncourt's review of each individual treatment plan. Guardianship counsel are\ntile attorueys who seek to enforce the rights of the students in those\nproceedings. Guardianship counsel could have sought intervention at ally\ntime since 1987, but thiled to do so. Guardianship counsel cannot now\nseek to appear \"in any filture hearing before the court.\" (Brief of\nGuardianship Counsel, 8) They seek to intervene now, not only in the\nComplaint for Contempt, but also in the future in an €ffort to enforce\nstudents rights \"to safety, freedom from harm, freedom from unnecessary\nrestraint, freedom from cruel and unusnal punishment, to adequate\ntreatment in the least restrictive setting, to appropriate education and to\ncomp!iance with DMR regulations.\" (Brief of guardianship counsel, 35-36)\nWhile all of these are laudable objectives 6, they are properly the subject of\nthe individual substituted judgment hearhlgs where the facts and\ncircumstances of each individual student's situation n_=y be fully explored.\nThese rights are not the subject matter of the Complaint for Contempt\nwhich was filed by BRI on September 2, 1993. Guardianship counsel have\nbeen well aware of the ongoing controversy between BRI and DMR since\nthat time and the details of the proceedings are well known to the\nindividual students through them. Despite representations to the contrary,\nthere has been no pivotal event or moment at which time the individual\nstudents' interests were suddenly knoxs_ to be threatened. Cf. McDonnell\nwhere the court found that if'the underlying action takes an\nunexpected turn, no reason could be perceived why the third party could\nnot intervene. 22 Mass.App. 126, 491 N.E.2d 646, 651 (Mass. App. 1986)\n6 Itisnotexvorthy thatguardianship counsel donot recognize the danger which may\nresult to the Students ifBRI isclosed which theComplaint forContempt alleges isthe\nreal objective sought by DMRforitsactions. Nowhere doesguardianship counsel urge\nthattreatment programs atBRIremainavailable forthe individual students,\n2O\n\nThe determinatiou of timeliness is s_,4thin tile sound discretion of the\n(district) court and cannot be disturbed unless aa abuse of discretion has\nbeen demonstrated. Garri O'v. Galleu, 697 F.2d 452, 455 (lst Cir. 1983) In\ndetermining timeliness of a petition to intervene, the court must consider\nthe length of time the intervenor knew or should have kdlOWUof his interest\nbefore filing a petition, prejudice to the existing parties due to his failure to\npetition for interveutiou promptly, the prejudice to the intervenor if not\nallowed to interveoe and the existence ofunusual circumstances which\nv,ould require or uot require intervention. Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d\n15(lst 1980)\nNot only did guardianship counsel know of the interest they seek to\nadvance through intervention for nmre than seven )'ears before filing their\npetition, intervention would result in real prejudice to the Student Members\nof the Class and to other parties. The trial has already been completed and\na retrial xvould be exlremely time consuming and prejudicial to the\nstudents. The students h_ve already suffered and would be further harmed\nas a result of the likelihood of continued and protracted litigation that\nintervention would cause. Comssel for the Student Members of the Class\nfiled a Motion on January 28, 1994, for Emergency Relief in which they\nrepresented to the court that the resources even then available to the\nstudents had been greatly diluted as a result of the depletion of staffing and\nfunding caused by the litigation. (App.24) This was two months prior to\nguardianship counsel filing the request to intervene. The survival of Bgl as\nan institute after two additional years of intense litigation is precarious. As\nthe court in Culbreath recognized, \"(a)s long as this suit remains\nunresolved, the public and private resources invested in it lie fallow and\n21\n\nopportunities to rectify the xwungs of which the plaintiffs complain are\nunrealized\" Culbreath at 22.\nThe court may consider the chance for success on the merits\nwhich the proposed intervenors may have when considering timeliness.\nCulbreatk at 23 Because guardianship counsel misperceive the issues at\ndispute in the Complaint for Contempt, there is little chance for their\nsuccess. Further delay would likely result, compounding the injuries the\nStudent Members of the Class have already experienced. Indeed, any\nprejudice to the proposed intervenors is outweighed by the unlikelihood for\ntheir success on the merits.\nb. The Interests of the Individual Students Should be Asserted\nThrough Proceedings Designed for that Purpose Not Through the\nContempt Action\nTo have an interest that justifies intervention, that interest must be\ndirectly not tangentialy related to the subject matter of the lawsuit. U.S. _:\nMetropolitan Dist.Com'N, 147 F.R.D. I, 4 (D.Mass. 1993) Guardianship\ncounsel resist that the individual students must be penuitted to intervene in\nthe Complaint for Contempt in order to protect their fights as individuals.\nThey further claim that representatives of the existing Class cannot possibly\nunderstand their individual needs and disabilities. For the most part, the\ninterests asserted by guardianship counsel on behaffofthe individual\nstudents (to safety, freedom from harm, freedom from unnecessary\nrestraint, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, to adequate\ntreatment in the least restrictive setting, and to appropriate education ) are\nfully addressed within individual hearings designed to deal with the unique\ncircumstances and needs of each student. To the ¢x'tent that guardianship\n22\n\ncounsel seek broad compliance x_itlt DMR regulations, that same concern\nwas ex'!?ressed by Attontey Schwartz in 1987. The court concluded that the\nSettlemett Agreement had numerous provisions to ensure monitoring of\nBKI. (App.67-68, para.8) The court rejected the arguntent that the\nsubstituted judgment bearings were inadequate to secure the rights of\nindividual students at BRI as being %_Jthout merit.\" (App.68, para.9)\nThe overall well-being and interest of the Student Mentbers of the\nClass may not be identical to the interests ofeach individual student. For\neach individual student to raise his o_11 concerns in a Complaint for\nContempt is inappropriate where a more suitable foruln has already been\nprovided for that purpose.\nMoreover, the Motion Io Intervene filed by the individual students\ndemonstrates a lack ofmlderstanding about what the Complaint for\nComempt actually seeks. It is a Complaint for Contempt filed by BRI\nalleging certain violations of the settlement agreement by DMR. It was\nfiled when DMR threatened to decertify BRIL it is not an appropriate\nforum in which individual students should assert tbeir particular grievances\nagainst BRI or DMR. The Complaint in Intervention states as causes of\naction that each of the students at BRI have had numerous individual rights\nguaranteed by them under the Fourteenth Amendment ofthe U.S.\nConstitution and under Articles X and Xll of the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights violated. Further, many of the students allege\n7Guardianship counsel include in the Appendix correspondence betv,_enBRI and DMR\nandothers (App.I16-136,160-173) tosupporta numberofarguments, including for the\npropositionthat DMR'sdecision todecertify BRIcame afteranexhaustive review of\npractices atBRI These documents presentonly apartialanddistortedpictureand\nignore the factthat DMR was foundattrialtohave had t..',_earlier reviev,'sof BRl\nwhich supportedcertification of BRI.Thefavorable reviews werefoundtohave been\nconcealed byDMRfrom BRIandfromthe courtitself.\n23\n\nviolations of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the Code of\nMassachusetts Regulations, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, The\nMassachusetts Special Education Law, the Medical Devices Amendments\nof the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. (App.28-29) These\nallegations are not even tangentialy related to the Complaint for Contempt\nwhich alleges specific violations of the Settlement Agreement and could\nnot possibly be heard with the Complaint for Contempt without great delay\nand prejudice to all parties. This is not a situation such as found in\nSargeant v. Commissioner q[Public tVe/_rro_here the court found that\nthe complaint in intewention closely paralleled the plaintiffs complaint in\nthe attire!, the complaint ill intervention raised no substantive issues that\nhad not been raised before or that all of the factual issues which were\nrelevant to the hltervenofs claim had to be resolved h_the trial of the\nplaintiffs claim. 423 N.E.2d 755, 762 (198 I). It is questionable why\nguardianship counsel has not brought a separate cause of action for the\nindividual students they represent if grievances of the magoitude alleged\nhave occurred.\n5. The Interests of Individual Students Are Alread2z\nAdeq_resented in this Matter.\nIn order to intervene as a matter of right, guardianship counsel must\ndemonstrate that the interests of the individual students are not adequately\nrepresented. Mass.ILCiv.lho. 24(a) The question of_vhether the\nprospective intervenor is adequately represented necessarily turns to a\ncomparison of the interests asserted by the applicant and the existing party.\n_ower DevelolJ. v. Town of Dem_is, 418 N.E.2d 349, 354. (Mass.App.\n24\n\n1981) lfthis interest is identical to that ofone of the present parties, or if\nthere is a party charged by law v,ith representing his interest, then a\ncompelling showing should be required to demonstrate why this\nrepresentation is not adequate. M_, 354, citing 7A Wright & Miller,\nFederal Practice and Procedure §1909. The court has found that the\ninterest of the individual students is adequately represented by their Parents\nor Guardians as uex't friends, that the Students are Members of a Plaintiff\nClass in tile issue of contempt, and that they are represented by separate\ncounsel. Independent legal representation of the students protects them\nfrom any potential conflict with the interest of the parents and guardians\nwho are also members of the Class. Further each student has an\nindependent court-appointed cotmsel to represent them in guardianship and\nsubstituted judgment proceedings. (App.244).\nThe burden of showing the inadequacy of the representation is on\nthe applicant. Attorney General v. Brockton Agr.Soc., 1130 N.E.2d 1130,\n1131 Trbovich v. UnitedMine Workers, 404 U.E. 528, 538, n. I0, 92 S.Ct.\n630, 636 n. 10, 30 L.Ed.2d 686 (19'72) Guardianship counsel have failed to\nmeet this burden. They make unsupported allegations that attorneys for the\nStudent members of the class have no familiarity with the individual needs\nand conditions of the students and have spent little time with the individual\nstudents, a (App.32, footnotes 42-43).\nGuardianship counsel suggest that the students were not adequately\nprotected at the trial of the contempt because counsel for the Student\n8During oralargument inthe trial court,counsel forthe Student members ofthe Class\nrepresented tothe courtthat she had been toBRI.spent anextensive amount of time\nthere and meta number of the students only tobecastigated byguardianship counsel in\nthe courtfordoing just that. Attorney Dorsey further informed the courtthat she had\nreceived communicationsfrom guardianship counsel demanding that she not\ncommunica'_ withthe students any longer. (App.219-220)\n25\n\nMembersof the Class presented no evidence whatsoever. (Brief of\nGuardianship Comlsel, footnote 27) Although the contempt proceedings\nare not before this court, guardianship comlsel's misleading suggestion\nmust he addressed. The trial of the Contempt took several weeks. The\ncourt was presented with numerous witnesses who were called by BRI or\nDMIL Comlsel for the Student members of the Class were present and\nquestioned many of those witnesses. The fact that additional witnesses\nwere not called by counsel for the Student members of the Class or that\ncounsel did not seek to enter any exhibits beyond the several hundred\nentered by the other parties Olfly means that the attorneys representing the\nstudents did not need to do so in order to adequately represent the\nstudents. Where the parties, who know the actual circumstances, present\nno basis for concluding that the representation might be inadequate and\nsshere on the record the representation appears adequate, it is not for us to\nspeculate concerning possible inadequacies in that representation. Attome.g\nGeneral v. Brockton Agr.Soc., ! 134.\nD. The Individual Students Should Not Be Pemfitted to Intervene -\nUnder Mass.R.Civ.Pro. 24(bX2)\nThe court may pemfit intervention under Mass.lLCiv.Pro. 24(bX2)\n\"when au applicant's claim or defense hi the main action may have a\nquestion of law or fact in common.., in exercising its discretion the court\nshall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the\nadjudication of the fights ofthe original parties.\"\nWhile the court has the power in its discretion to permit the\nindividual students to intervene, the motion was properly denied.\n26\n\nGuardianshipcounsel argued to the trial court that all of the individual\nstudents at BRI have significant disabilities and suffer from mental\nimpairments. They further noted that the individual students are vulnerable\nto abuse and neglect and need assistance in protecting their legal fights.\nHowever, this is true of the population of BgI students at large, as svell as\nfor each indMdual student. If each individual student is permitted to\nintervene and assert his indMdual rights s_ithin a contempt action, it may\nbe at the expense of the other students as members of the Class. The delay,\nconfusion, potential for conflict, e.xpens¢ and depiction of resources\navailable for the student body at large _s.ere sound reasons for the trial\ncourt to deny the Motion to Intervene raider Mass.lLCiv.Pro. 24(bX2). To\ndo otherwise would have resulted in compromising the rights of a\nvuh_erabl¢ population at large in order to advance the interest of a\nparticular vulnerable individual. This is unwarranted and unnecessary as\nthe fights and interests of indMdual students may be vigorously advanced\nin the substituted judgment bearings. The interests of the Student members\nof the Class at BRI are best represented in the contempt by the attorneys\nappointed to represent them at large. Permissive intervention is a matter\nv,hoUy within the discretion of the trial court. Mass. Fed. of Teachers v.\nSchool Com., 564 N.E.2d 1027, 1031 (Mass. 1991) The trial judge must\nconsider whether allowing intervention nfight delay or prejudice the\nadjudication of the rights of the parties, ld. Additional parties inevitably\nresult in delay in the proceedings as well as increased complexity. Id. citing\nadditioptal attthorities.\n27\n\nV. The Student Members of the Class Are Entitiled to Attorneys Fees\nIn the event that they prevail, the Student Members of the Class\nrespectfully request that appellate attorney's fees be awarded as provided in\nYorke Management v.Castro. 546 N.E.2d 342, 344 (Mass. 1989)\nGuardianship counsel have sought relief based upon a lack of adequate\nrepresentation, clainfing no class exists. They did so knowing that the trial\ncourt had certified the Class in 1986. The attorney representing\nguardianship com_sel participated in the proceedings in 1986-1987. He\nwas chastised by the court then for raising certain claims. His own\nindpendence was questioned by the trial court at the time. Attorney\nSchwartz essentially raises the same issues before this Court The only\ndidffereuce is the passage of almost ten years. The appeal is totally lacking\nin merit and counsel had to be aware that the appeal was foredoomed. FMS\nReallThwestment, Ltd v Kee-er, 34 Mass.App 119, 606 N.E.2d 1352\n(Mass.App. 1993). It is entirely frivolous for guardianship counsel to\nattempt to rditigate issues lost nearly ten years ago in a complaint for\ncontempt which is only remotely related to their claims.\nVI. Conclusion\nGuardianship counsel's requests to be appointed as next friend for\neach individual student and to intervene, both as a nhatter of right and\npermissively, should be denied as being within the sound discretion of the\ncourt The students at BRI are presently parties to the action as members\nof a Class and are adequately represented in that action.\n28\n\nTheStudent members of the Class are entitled to counsel fees and\ncosts relative to this appeal which was both frivolous in nature and without\nchance for success.\nJanuary30,1996\nDorsey & Dorsey\n207 Front Street, P.O.

(S.A. 151).I First, there is DMR's appeal after trial from\najudgment of contempt and order dated October 6, 1995. (App. 1353). Second,\nDMR appeals from the issuance of apre-trial preliminary injunction dated March\n24, 1995. (App. 128). Finally, JRC appeals from the modification of the\npreliminary injunction by a Single Justice of the Appeals Court (Brown, J.).\n(S.A. 137).\nA. The Contempt Proceedings\nThe genesis of this case began on February 28, 1986, when the Behavior\nResearch Institute, now known as the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, Inc.\n(\"JRC\" or \"BRI\"), and a ploposed class of parents acting individually, and on\nbehalf of their children enrolled at JRC, filed a Complaint against the\n,Xla,ssachusetts Office for Children and its Director (\"OFC\"). (App. 52). OFC\nhad issued orders requiring JRC to stop treatments for its severely\ndevelopmentally disabled student population, closing intake at the school, and\nthreatening suspension of JRC's license. (App. 52). The Complaint asserted\ncivil rights violations and sought injunctive relief for OFC's bad faith regulatory\nand licensing activities. (App. 52) The action was filed in the Bristol County\nProbate and Family Court and the kate Justice Ernest Rotenberg was specially\nassigned as a Superior Court Justice tohear allof the claims (the \"Trial Court\").\n(App. 5).\nBecause of the severe harm being caused to the students, Plaintiffs moved\ntot a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin OFC from terminating the\ntreatment plans. (App. 81). Following an evidentiary hearing, the Trial Court\nissued a decision on June 4, 1986 _,_'hichmade extensive findings regarding the\nAllreferences tothe recordhereinare referenced as follows: referencestothe\nAppendix cited as \"App. ;\" references to the Trial Transcript according to volume\nand consecutive numbered pages thereto cited as Tr. , , references to Uncontested\nTrial Exhibits and pages therein cited as \"U- , ;\" references to \"];r;alExhibits\nadmitted byJRC and pages thereincited as \"JRC- , ;\" references to frial Exhibits\nadmitted by DMR and pages therein cited as DMR-, , \"\" and references to the\nSupplemental Appendix submitted by JRC cited as S.A. .\n\nDirector'sbadfaithregulatorpyracticeasndgrantedtherequesteindjunction.\n(App.107).A SingleJusticeoftheAppeals Court (Greaney. C.J.) denied the\nDirector relief from the preliminary injunction, concluding that there was ample\nsupport for the Trial Court's findings of bad faith and the injunction which had\nbeen issued. (App. 109-111,113).\nFollowing injunctive relief, BRI, the Plaintiff Class and OFC engaged in\nsettlement discussions which ct,lminated in a Settlement Agreement dated\nDecember 12, 1996. (\"Settlement Agreement\"). (U-2: App. 1.20,131). The\nTrial Court approved the Settlement Agreement on January 7, 1987 finding it to\nbe fair and reasonable, and incorporated it as an order of the court. (U-4' S.A.\n18). Among its provisions, Part A of the Settlement Agreement provided that\ntreatment decisions for JRC students were to be made by the Court using the\nsubstituted judgment criteria. (U-2, 2). Pursuant to Paragraph B, Dr. John\nDaignault was appointed asCourt Monitor (\"Court Monitor\" or \"Dr. Daignault\")\nto undertake \"general monitoring of JRC's treatment and educational program,\"\nand to arbitrate any disputes between the parties. (U-2, 6). Finaily the parties\nwere required to act ingood faith in carrying out their responsibilities under the\nSettlement Agreement. 03-2, 14).\nThe Trial Court's order provided for the termination of the Settlement\nAgreement in one year \"unless the Court orders otherv, ise.\" (U-4), After two\nsix-month extensions, on July 7, 1988, the Trial Court issued an order extending\njurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement \"until further order of this Court.\"\n(App. 135-137). The order noted that there were n,Jobjections to the extension\nof jurisdiction. (App. 137).\nOn December 29, 1988, the Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR\")\nmoved to amend the Settlement Agreement. DMR entered the case as successor\nto OFC and the Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\") inregulating JRC. (U-\n13). The Trial Court specially noted that it was treating DMR's motion as an\nintervention under Rule 24 and \"welcom[ed] [DMRI as a party under the\nSettlement Agreement.\" (U-1`3). DMR did not appeal or otherv,'ise challenge the\nCourt's order.\n2\n\nTheproceedingwshichgaverisetothejudgmenotfcontempbt,eganon\nSeptembe7r,1993w, henJRCfiledacomplainftorcontempptursuantot Mass.\nR.Civ.P.65.3againsDtMRCommissionPehrilipCampbeclllaimingviolations\nof thecourt-approveSdettlemenAtgreement. (S.A. 27). In essence, JRC's\nclaims as amended alleged inter alia that the Commissioner violated the\nSettlement Agreement by interfering with court-authorized treatment provisions,\nrefusing to mediate disputes with Dr. Daignault, and failing to act in good faith\nin his regulation of IRC.\nOn March 23, 1995, the Commissioner decertified JRC and ordered all\ncourt-approved treatment procedures stopped as of July 1, 1995. (U-179). The\nnext day, JRC moved tbr a preliminary injunction seeking to enj,',,in the\nCommissiouer from revoking JRC's certification, and preserve the statu_\npending trial. The Trial Court allowed the motion that same date. (App. 283).'-\nThe trial ofJRC's contempt claims took place during three weeks inJune\nand July of 1995. The Trial Court heard from seventeen witnesses and admitted\nover lbur hundred exhibits. In its Judgment and Order dated October 6, 1995,\nthe Trial Court held the Commissioner in contempt, finding that he had violated\nthe provisions of the Settlement Agreement thereby causing \"egregious and\nirreparable\" harm to JRC, its students and their parents. (App. 1340). As a\nremedy t\\_r the contempt, the Trial Court ordered that DMR be enjoined from\nfailing to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and from\ninterfering with outstanding treatment orders issued by the Court. (App. 1340,\n1342). The trial judge also ordered that DMR be stripped of its regulatory\nauthority over JRC and a receiver ',,,'asappointed to assume DMR's regulatory\nresp_._nsihitities over JRC until further order of the Court. (App. 1342-1348).\nPlaintiffs were also awarded attorneys fees and expenses. (App. 1341).\nFinal judgment entered on October 6, 1995. (App. 48). On October 11,\n1995, the Commissioner filed his notice of appeal. (App. 1353). Thereafter,\n: After Judge Rotenberg's death, Judge Elizabeth O'Neill LaStaiti of the Probate\nand Family Court was specially assigned in August 1992 as _tJustice of the Superior\nCourt to replace Judge Rotenberg with respect to these matters. (App. 1207).\n\nthis Court granted Direct Appellate Review and the appeal ,,,,,asdocketed as SJC-\n07101.\nThe Commissioner filed a Motion to Stay the injunctive and receivership\norders pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 62(a), which was denied by the Trial Court\non November 6, 1995. (App. 1432). Thereafter, the Conmrissioner renewed his\nMotion to Stay in the Appeals Court, pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 6(a), ',,,,here\na Single Justice, (Smith, J.), denied the motion on November 28, 1995 following\na hearing. (App. 1454).\nAfter receiving the Single Just _.es dects_on, the Commissioner filed a\npetition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, § 3, with a Single Justice of this Court\nrequesting relief from the denial of the stay by both the Trial Court and the\nSingle Justice of the Appeals Court. (App. 1456). On December 5, 1995, this\nCourt (Lynch, J.) denied the motion. (App. 1465). On December 8, 1995, the\nCommissioner then filed an appeal from the order of the Single Justice pursuant\nto SJC Rule 2:21. docketed as SJC-07093, as well as a request for a stay of the\nSingle Justice's order. (App. 1466, 1467). On January 12, 1996, the full bench\nof this Court denied the requested stay pending appeal, and dismissed the appeal\nas both moot and in violation of SJC Rule 2:21. See Commissioner of Mental\nRetardation v. Judge Rr_tenber_ Educational Center Inc.. 421 Mass. 1010\n(1996). (App. 1471).\nB. Appeal From The Preliminary In unction - SJC-06956\nOn March 24, 1995. the Trial Court entered a status _ preliminary\ninjunction in favor of JRC and the Plaintiff Cla_s enjoining the Commissioner\nfrom decertifying the JRC treatment program pending a trial on the merits of the\ncontempt action. (S.A. 127). The Commissioner appealed the injunction to a\nlull panel of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, § 118, ¶ 2. (S.A.\n128). This Court granted direct appellate review and the appeal was docketed\nas SJC-06956.\nOn October 31, 1995, JRC filed a Motion to Dismiss SJC-06956 on the\ngrounds that the final judgment entered by the Trial Court in the contempt case\nrendered an appeal from an interlocutory preliminary injunction order moot.\n(S.A. 138). Following a hearing and report of the Single Justice (Greaney, J.),\n4\n\nthisCourt denied the motion to dismiss on March 8, 1996, and ordered that any\nissues in SJC-06956 be briefed as part of the appeal from the final judgment of\ncontempt in SJC-07101. (S.A. 151).\nC. Appeal From Modification Of Interlocutory Orders By\nThe SinRle Justice Of The Appeals Court- SIC-07045\nIn addition to filing an appeal to the lull panel of the Appeals Court, the\nCommissioner filed a petition pursuant toG. L. c. 231, § 118, _ 1, seeking relief\nor modification of the Trial Court's order dated March 24, 1995 grantir, g the\npreliminary injunction. (S.A. 129). The petition was docketed as 95-J-300. On\nMay 11, 1995, without a hearing and without providing JRC with any\nopportunity to respond, a Single Justice of the Appeals Court (Prown, J.)\nmodified the preliminary injunction by adding a third subparagraph which\nordered that JRC stop using tour treatment procedures which had been previously\nauthorized by the Probate Court. (S.A. 133).\nIna related matter, the court-appointed counsel in fifty-two guardianship\nproceedings filed identical motions in the Probate Court to stop these same four\ntreatment procedures (\"Global Motion\"). (S.A. 40-41). On April 14, 1995, the\nTrial Court denied the Global Motion. (S.A. 67). Guardianship Counsel then\nfiled a petition with the Single Justice of the Appeals Court for interlocutory\nrelief from the denial of the Global Motion, which was docketed as 95-J-362.\n(S.A. 135). On June 7, 1995, again without a hearing, the Single Justice\n(Brown. J.) modified the denial of the Global Motion by incorporating the order\nof 95-J-300 into the order in 95-J-362. _S.A. 135).\nOn June 12, 1995, in response to a motion to clarify filed by DMR, the\nSingle Justice issued a supplemental order in 95-J-300 expres.qy setting fi_nh the\ntbur treatment procedures JRC was required :.oterminate, v,hich were the same\nas those listed in95-J-362. (S.A. 134). JRC filed a petition under G. L. c. 211,\n§ 3, with a Single Justice of this Court (Abrams, J.) seeking to vacate the\nmodification of the preliminary injunction and restore the status _ pending\ntrial. The petition was denied. (S.A. 136). JRC then filed an appeal to a full\npanel of the Appeals Court from the parallel orders entered in95-J-300 and 95-J-\n5\n\n362.

On March 8, 1996, the lull bench of this Court, alter report by the\nSingle Justice, denied the motion and instructed the parties to brief the issues\nraised in SJC-07045 in the appeal from the final judgment of contempt. (S.A.\n151).\n6\n\nSql. SJC-06956 AND SJC-07045 APPEAL FROM TilE\nIN'I'ERLOCUTORY ORDERS\nA. SJC-06956 Has Been Rendered Moot By Entry Of Final\nJudgment ....\nIt iswell-settled that apreliminary injunction does notsurvive the entry\nof final judgment in the action in which the injunctive relief was originally\ngranted:\nWhen a final decree is entered, a preliminary injunction has\nserved its purpose. If the Plaintiff is then deemed entitled to an\ninjunction, the final decree can provide it... [AI preliminary\ninjunction does not survive the entry of a final decree [which\nbecomes effective as soon as entered], whether relief is thereby\ngrated or denied.\nCarlson v. Lawrence H. Oppenheim Co., 334 Mass. 462,465 (1956), _quot_Q_\nfrom Lowell Bar Association v. Loeb, 315 Mass. 176, 189-190 (1943); see a_!._,\nIn The Matter Of McK.night, 406 Mass. at 792 n.4 (preliminary injunction\nremains in effect only until a final judgment is zendered). Thus, an appellate\ncourt will normally refuse to undertake any review of a preliminary injunction\nonce final judgment has entered because all issues concerning the propriety of the\npreliminary injunction are extinguished and rendered moot by the entry of a final\norder. See Mahony v. Board of Assessors of Watertown, 362 Mass. 210, 216\nn.3 (1972); see also 8A Smith & Zobel, Rules Practice §65.10, p.92 (1984) (full\ndetermination of case by Trial Court renders appellate review of preliminary\ninjunction moot).\nEven if the Trial Court had not expressly dissolved the status\npreliminary injunction in its Judgment and Order, (App. 1342), the entry of final\njudgment in the underlying contempt proceeding on October 6, 1995,\nimmediately and automatically extinguished the preliminary injunction as a matter\nof law leaving nothing for this Court to decide regarding to the propriety of\npreliminary injunctive reliefl In practical terms, this Court cannot grant any\nrelief in either vacating or affirming the preliminary injunction which will not be\nsubsumed in the decision on the appeal on the merits from the contempt\njudgment. The entry of final judgment expressly and by operation of law, has\n174\n-q\n\nrendereadnappeaflromthepreliminarjyudgmenmt ootandSJC-0695d6oes not\npresent any live issues for this Court to decide.\nB. SJC-07045, the Modified Interlocutory Orders of the Trial Court\nShould Be Vacated\n1. The modified nreliminary in_unc_ion is moo_\nThe order of the Single Justice of the Appeals Court in 95-.1-300 is\nmerely a modified preliminary injunction. There is no question that, as already\ndiscussed in regards to SJC-06956, had the Single Justice not modified the status\nnun preliminary injunction, itwould have been rendered moot by the entry of the\nfinal judgment. Thus, it logically follows that the entry of final judgment in the\nunderlying contempt proceeding automatically extinguished the modified version\nof the preliminary injunction as a matter of law leaving nothing for this Court to\ndecide in regards to the first prong of the consohdated appeal.\n2. The modified order on the elobal motion is vacated by\nthe final iudgment\nThe Appeals Court Single Justice expressly incorporated the order on the\nmodified preliminary injunction in95-J-300 into his order partially vacating the\ndenial of the Global Motion in 95-J-362. (S.A. 135). Although the Single\nJustice of the Appeals Court issue_ no opinion and did not give JRC an\nopportunity to respond to the Commissioner's petition, both orders on their face\nshow that they were both based upon and connected with the modification of the\noriginal preliminary injunction. Thus, the order modifying the Global Motion\nwas likewise vacated ,,,,'henthe underl',ing preliminary injunction, as subsequently\nmodified by the Single Justice, was extinguished upon entry of final judgment.\nFurthermore, the Single Justice inmodifying the Global Motion approved\nand upheld condition 96-1 in the Commissioner's January 20 Letter, by ordering\nthe four specific Level 111aversive therapies decertified in the letter terminated\nand removed from all treatment plans. (S.A. 135). Although the Trial Court did\nnot revoke any of the outstanding certification decisions by the Commissioner in\nissuing its judgment, the Trial Court ordered the receiver to review all such\n\nregulatordyecisionismposed on JRC by the Commissioner to ensure that such\nregulation complied with the Settlement Agreement and the law, and to revoke\nany that did not. (App. 1343-44). Allowing the order of the Single Justice,\nwhich upholds the Commissioner's decision terminating the four treatments, to\nstand would result in an irreconcilable conflict with the express relief granted in\nthe Judgment and Order. The inconsistency is exemplified by the fact that the\nreceiver has since rescinded the January 20 Letter in whole, yet JRC is unable\nto apply any of the four court-approved Level !II therapies in condition 96-1\nbecause the receiver has deferred to the outstanding order of the Single Justice.\n(S.A. 81). The untenable result is that an interlocutory order controls where a\nfinal judgment exists, and that the full relief of the Judgment and Order cannot\nbe enjoyed because of the modification of the Global Motion. Likewise, the\norder of the Single Justice upholding the Commissioner's termination of these\nfour treatments continues to violate Part A of th,; Settlement Agreement, which\nrequires that the Trial Court, not the Commissioner, make treatment decisions.\nThe modified Global Motion can no longer stand in light of the entry of final\njudgment, the relief granted and the terms of the Settlement Agreement, must be\nvacated by this Court.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center,\nlnc, requests this Honorable Court to:\n1. Affirm the judgment of contempt and relief granted by the Trial\nCourt;\n2. Award them costs and appellate attorneys' fees;\n3. Dismiss with prejudice the appeal from the preliminary\ninjunction; and\n4. Vacate the interlocutory orders of the Trial Court as modified by\na Single Justice of the Appeals Court.\nRespectfully submitted,\nTHE JUDGE ROTENBERG EDUCATIONAL\nCENTER, INC.,\nBy its attorneys,\nRoderick MacLeish, Jr. (BBO# 311880)\nMichael P.
