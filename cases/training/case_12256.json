The Spangenberg Group, on behalf of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants, prepared this 2004 report which garnered significant national and local media attention.  It detailed severe systemic problems with Virginia's indigent defense system and recommended a number of reforms.  This report was influential in helping educate the public about the serious flaws in the then-existing indigent defense system, as well as informing the legislative debate around the type of reform that was most appropriate.

The study was conducted on behalf of the American Bar \nAssociation Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants.  \n \n  While numerous reports criticizing Virginia’s indigent defense system have been \nproduced over the past 30 years, very little has been done over that period to remedy the \nproblems identified.  This report is perhaps the most comprehensive review produced to date.  \nThe chief conclusion of the review is that Virginia’s indigent defense system is deeply flawed \nand fails to provide indigent defendants the guarantees of effective assistance of counsel required \nby federal and state law.  The report discusses in detail the individual shortcomings of the system \nthat produce this overall failure to assure that the rights of poor people accused of crimes are \nprotected.   \n \n  Formed in 1985, The Spangenberg Group (TSG) has conducted research in all 50 states \nand provides consultative services to developing and developed countries that are reforming their \nlegal aid delivery programs.  For over 18 years, TSG has been under contract with the American \nBar Association's Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants to provide support \nand technical assistance to individuals and organizations working to improve their jurisdictions' \nindigent defense systems.  Including Virginia, TSG has conducted comprehensive statewide \nstudies of indigent defense systems in 36 states. \n  \n  The methodology for this study included: review of reports and data on Virginia’s \nindigent defense system from numerous sources; on-site assessments of the indigent defense \nsystems in 13 Virginia judicial circuits; analysis of the Supreme Court of Virginia \nAdministrative Office database on assigned counsel; analysis of budget, caseload and other data \nprovided by the Virginia Public Defender Commission; and collection and analysis of \ncomparison information from other states' indigent defense systems.   \n   \n  The 13 circuits studied are representative of Virginia’s 31 judicial circuits/districts, \ngeography and population, and reflect a diversity of system types (three jurisdictions were served \nsolely by court-appointed counsel while the other 10 used a public defender office and assigned \ncounsel).  In each of the 13 circuits/districts visited, we met with people who are involved with \nindigent defense services, including: circuit court judges, district court judges, juvenile and \ndomestic relations court judges, court clerks, the Commonwealth’s attorney and/or staff, Public \nDefender Commission staff and members, public defender and court-appointed attorneys, and \nthe sheriff or a jailer familiar with indigent defense procedures.  In addition to conducting \nprofessional interviews, we observed criminal court sessions in most sites and juvenile court \nsessions in a few sites.   Site work was conduced between June and September 2003.  In total, we \nspent 79 days in Virginia, conducting interviews with 370 individuals who work in more than 60 \ncourts, observing sessions in 27 courts and visiting five jails. \n \n \n  i\n\nFindings  \n \n  Chapter 9 of this report includes The Spangenberg Group’s overall findings of Virginia’s \nindigent defense system.  The black letter findings appear below: the full findings with \nexplanation appear in Chapter 9. The findings are based on our review of indigent defense in \nVirginia and are also based on the perspective and experience The Spangenberg Group has \ngained studying the indigent defense systems of other states over the years.   \n \nOVERALL FINDINGS \n \n1.  Virginia’s indigent defense system fails to adequately protect the rights of poor \npeople who are accused of committing crimes.   \n \n2.  Two primary factors - inadequate resources and an absence of an oversight \nstructure – form the basis of an indigent defense system that fails to provide lawyers \nwith the tools, time and incentive to provide adequate representation to indigent \ndefendants.   \n \n3.  In the past 30 years, numerous studies and reports have been conducted on \nVirginia’s indigent defense system, most pointing out similar problems and calling \nfor similar solutions.   \n \n4.  The deeply flawed system puts lawyers at substantial risk of violating professional \nrules of conduct when representing indigent defendants.   \n \n5.  There is no official state entity that effectively advocates for indigent defense needs \nin Virginia.  No governmental entity serves as a voice for indigent defense: not the \nPublic Defender Commission, not the State Bar, not the Supreme Court, not the \nExecutive Branch and not the General Assembly.  \n \n6.  Because of a lack of response by elected officials, there has proven to be no \nmeaningful way to seek redress for the problems with Virginia’s indigent defense \nsystem.   \n \n7.  Court-appointed attorneys and public defenders make very limited use of expert \nwitnesses and court-appointed lawyers make very little use of investigators, services \nthat are essential to proper representation of clients in many cases.   \n \n8.  Substandard practice has become the accepted norm in Virginia’s indigent defense \nsystem.   \n \n9.  Virginia ranks last in average indigent defendant cost per case among a group of 11 \nstates for which such data was collected for FY 2002 (the states are Alabama, \nColorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, \nOhio, Virginia and West Virginia).  \n  ii\n\n  \nSPECIFIC FINDINGS PERTAINING TO VIRGINIA’S ASSIGNED COUNSEL SYSTEM \n \n10.  The unwaiveable statutory fee caps for court-appointed counsel in Virginia are the \nlowest in the country.  \n \n11.  The unreasonably low statutory fee caps act as a disincentive to many assigned \ncounsel from doing the work necessary to provide meaningful and effective \nrepresentation to their indigent clients. \n  \n12.  In addition to the problems stemming from low pay, there are numerous systemic \ndeficiencies with the assigned counsel system in Virginia that result in the failure of \ncourt-appointed lawyers to provide adequate representation to indigent defendants.   \n \n13.  The lack of oversight and administration permits a small number of attorneys to \nreceive a disproportionate number of appointed cases, raising serious concerns over \nthe quality of representation provided to their clients.   \n \n14.  The disparity in pay for court-appointed counsel representing parents in abuse and \nneglect cases and GALs who represent the best interests of children in these cases is \nunfair and illogical.   \n \n \nSPECIFIC FINDINGS PERTAINING TO VIRGINIA’S PUBLIC DEFENDER SYSTEM \n \n15.  The Virginia public defender system is greatly over-burdened and substantially \nunder-resourced.   \n \n16.  The entity that should be the advocate for adequate resources for public defender \noffices -- the Public Defender Commission -- has been more concerned with assuring \nthe public and elected officials that public defenders can handle cases as cheaply as \nor cheaper than appointed counsel.   \n \n17.  There is great disparity in resources afforded to public defenders and \nCommonwealth’s attorneys.   \n \nRecommendations  \n \n   Chapter 10 of this report contains several major systemic changes that The Spangenberg \nGroup recommends that Virginia undertake forthwith. These recommendations are as follows: \n \n(1) The Virginia General Assembly should fund indigent criminal defense services in \ncases requiring appointment of counsel at a level that assures that all indigent \ndefendants receive effective and meaningful representation.   \n \n  iii\n\n(2) The state should establish a professionally independent statewide indigent defense \ncommission to organize, supervise and assume overall responsibility of Virginia’s \nindigent defense system. \n \n(3) The newly created commission on indigent defense should have broad power and \nresponsibility for the delivery of indigent criminal defense services.   \n \n(4) The indigent defense commission should adopt performance and qualification \nstandards for both private assigned counsel and public defenders.  The standards \nshould address workload limits, training requirements, professional independence and \nother areas to ensure effective and meaningful representation. \n \n(5) A comprehensive data collection system designed to provide an accurate picture of \nthe provision of indigent criminal services in Virginia should be established and \nimplemented by the statewide commission. \n \n  The task ahead to reform the indigent defense system in Virginia is a daunting one.  \nMuch needs to be done, and these five recommendations should not be considered an exhaustive \nroad map outlining all areas of needed improvement.  However, we believe that the starting point \nto begin these efforts is creation of a new indigent defense commission and appropriation of \nsubstantial additional state funds during the 2004 legislative session of the General Assembly. \n  iv\n\nCHAPTER 1 \nINTRODUCTION \n  Virginia’s criminal justice system fails to adequately protect the rights of poor people \nwho are accused of committing crimes.  Represented by lawyers who have the most meager of \nresources, indigent defendants in Virginia are denied the fundamental guarantee of due process, \nor fairness, in legal proceedings against them. In the most extreme situations, innocent \nindividuals are wrongfully convicted. According to the Center on Wrongful Convictions at \nNorthwestern University of Law, 17 individuals have been exonerated of wrongful convictions \nin Virginia.1  Findings from a nine-month study suggest that many more indigent defendants in \nVirginia have likely received little more than assembly line justice.   \n \n  The Commonwealth’s current indigent defense system puts lawyers at substantial risk of \nviolating several of Virginia’s Rules of Professional Conduct when handling court-appointed \ncases.  Rule 1.1, Competence, provides:  “A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a \nclient.  Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and \npreparation reasonably necessary for the representation.”  At a bare minimum competent \nrepresentation of defendants requires lawyers to properly investigate facts, spot legal issues, \nconduct necessary research, negotiate with the prosecution, and meet with a client.  This is all \nout-of-court work -- case preparation -- and it takes time.    \n \n  Rule 1.3, Diligence, provides: “(a) A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and \npromptness in representing a client.”  Commentary to the rule explains that diligence entails \nworking with “commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy \nupon the client’s behalf.”  Rule 1.4, Communication, provides: “(a) A lawyer shall keep a client \nreasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests \nfor information. (b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent necessary to permit the client to \nmake informed decisions regarding the representation.”  Communication entails prompt initial \ncontact with a client and ongoing regular contact as a case progresses.  Like competence, \ndiligence and communication are traits that require an investment of adequate time and ability to \nmarshal the necessary tools and resources.  The Virginia indigent defense system does not afford \nlawyers the time or the resources to effectively represent their clients.  \n \n  These conclusions flow from this study conducted by The Spangenberg Group, a \nnationally and internationally recognized criminal justice research and consulting firm that \nspecializes in indigent defense services. The purpose of the study was to gauge the degree to \nwhich the indigent defense system in Virginia delivers competent, effective legal representation, \nthrough on-site data collection and analysis.  The study was prepared on behalf of the American \nBar Association Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants.  \n \n  Virginia has the lowest statutorily imposed compensation caps for court-appointed \nlawyers in the nation, thus strongly discouraging counsel from spending more than a few hours \non circuit court cases and even less on district court cases.  The actual figures are shocking—a \n                                                 \n1 See Northwestern University School of Law, Center on Wrongful Convictions, The Exonerated: Virginia, at \nhttp://www.law.northwestern.edu/depts/clinic/wrongful/exonerations/VirginiaList.htm (last modified July 18, 2003). \n  1\n\ncourt-appointed attorney cannot receive more than a total of $112 for a misdemeanor or juvenile \ndelinquency charge punishable by confinement, $1,096 for a felony charge punishable by more \nthan twenty years of confinement, and $395 for all other non-capital felony charges.  Public \ndefenders, who handled approximately 37% of the criminal indigent defendant caseload in 2002, \ncarry caseloads that far exceed national standards.  Public defender offices operate without \nfundamental tools of legal practice, such as internet access, paralegals or updated computers, and \nfew litigation resources are provided to the offices.  Both private, court-appointed lawyers and \npublic defenders struggle with “hide the ball” discovery rules and practices.  Experts, which can \nbe necessary to wage an adequate defense in cases involving medical, forensic, and scientific \nevidence, are rarely available in Virginia’s indigent defendant cases.  Assigned counsel rarely \nemploy the use of investigators, for whom payment must be authorized by the court.  They \nperform their own investigation or none at all.  \n \n  There is no statewide oversight of assigned counsel, and courts often appoint attorneys \nwho lack the requisite experience or training to handle a criminal case.  Further, there are no \nenforceable standards for assigned counsel in Virginia, which means there is no systematic way \nto prevent the re-appointment of unqualified attorneys to indigent defense cases.   \n \nThis report documents the current deficiencies of Virginia’s indigent defense system to \nassist in promotion of reform efforts.  Numerous reports on Virginia’s indigent defense system \nhave been produced in the past 30 years, yet little reform has been achieved. Appendix A \ncontains a 13-page summary of reports, studies, and legislative action pertaining to indigent \ndefense in Virginia in the past three decades.  Robert Spangenberg, President of The \nSpangenberg Group, first studied indigent defense in Virginia in 1984 and 1985.2  Most recently, \nthe Virginia State Crime Commission published House Document No. 32, a report on indigent \ndefense in Virginia,3 and published another report as requested by the General Assembly in \nNovember 2003.4  This report, which is perhaps the most comprehensive review produced to \ndate, details the extent of the crisis affecting indigent defense in Virginia utilizing a methodology \nthat includes data analysis and extensive professional interviews. Many of the findings in this \nreport echo those found in House Document No. 32.   \n   \n  Formed in 1985, The Spangenberg Group (TSG) has conducted research in all 50 states \nand provides consultative services to developing and developed countries that are reforming their \n                                                 \n2 Mr. Spangenberg, while still with Abt Associates, published a study, Analysis of Costs for Court-Appointed \nCounsel in Virginia in April 1985.  After forming The Spangenberg Group, in October 1985, Mr. Spangenberg \nproduced Projecting Costs for Various Indigent Defense Systems in Virginia for FY 1986, a study that was jointly \nsponsored by the American Bar Association Bar Information Project and the Virginia General Assembly.  \n3 In its 2000 session, the Virginia General Assembly enacted House Joint Resolution 178 directing the Virginia State \nCrime Commission to study the existing methods for providing indigent defense in Virginia with special focus on \nthree areas: quality of representation, efficiency of service and cost effectiveness.  \n4 This study was requested in the 2002 session of the Virginia General Assembly by Senator Kenneth W. Stolle in \nSenate Joint Resolution 43 (SJ43) and Delegate Terry G. Kilgore in House Joint Resolution 94 (HJ94).  The purpose \nof the study was to examine whether the establishment of a statewide indigent defense commission would improve \nthe quality and efficiency of the Commonwealth's indigent defense services. The resolutions directed the Crime \nCommission to study various models of statewide indigent defense commissions used by other states and to \nrecommend whether such a commission is appropriate for Virginia.  Indeed, the Crime Commission recommended \ncreation of an Indigent Defense Commission to oversee both assigned counsel and public defenders in Virginia.  \n  2\n\nlegal aid delivery programs.  For over 18 years, TSG has been under contract with the American \nBar Association's Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants to provide support \nand technical assistance to individuals and organizations working to improve their jurisdictions' \nindigent defense systems.  Including Virginia, TSG has conducted comprehensive statewide \nstudies of indigent defense systems in 36 states.5 \n \nMETHODOLOGY \n \n  The methodology for this study included: \n \n•  review of reports and data on Virginia’s indigent defense system from numerous \nsources, including the Virginia State Crime Commission, the Supreme Court of \nVirginia Administrative Office, the American Bar Association’s Juvenile Justice \nCenter, the American Bar Association Bar Information Program, the Virginia \nPublic Defender Commission and The Spangenberg Group;  \n•  on-site assessments of the indigent defense systems in 13 Virginia judicial \ncircuits;  \n•  analysis of the Supreme Court of Virginia Administrative Office database on \nassigned counsel;  \n•  analysis of budget, caseload and other data provided by the Virginia Public \nDefender Commission; and \n•  collection and analysis of comparison information from other states' indigent \ndefense systems.   \n   \n  The 13 circuits studied are representative of Virginia’s 31 judicial circuits/districts, \ngeography and population, and reflect a diversity of system types (three jurisdictions were served \nsolely by court-appointed counsel while the other 10 used a public defender office and assigned \ncounsel).   A listing of the jurisdictions appears in Table 1-1.6  In each of the 13 circuits/districts \nvisited, we met with people who are involved with indigent defense services, including:  \n \n•  Circuit court judges  \n•  District court judges  \n•  Juvenile and domestic relations court judges  \n•  Court clerks  \n•  Commonwealth’s attorney and/or staff \n•  Public Defender Commission staff and members \n                                                 \n5 TSG has conducted statewide indigent defense studies in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and \nWisconsin.  \n6 Indigent defense systems were studied in the following circuits/districts: 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 19, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29 \nand 31.  As seen in Table 1-1, in some jurisdictions, we studied the systems in portions of the circuit/district rather \nthan every court and city in the jurisdiction.  \n  3\n\n•  Public defender and court-appointed attorneys  \n•  Sheriff or a jailer familiar with indigent defense procedures.  \n \nInterviews were conducted by Spangenberg Group staff, all of whom are lawyers, as well as by \nseveral “practitioner consultants:” lawyers who are involved with indigent defense systems in \nGeorgia, Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee and Texas.  In addition to conducting \nprofessional interviews, we observed criminal court sessions in most sites and juvenile court \nsessions in a few sites.   Site work was conduced between June and September 2003.  In total, we \nspent 79 days in Virginia, conducting interviews with 370 individuals who work in more than 60 \ncourts, observing sessions in 27 courts and visiting five jails.  Appendix B includes a breakdown \nof interviewees by position and judicial circuit. \n \n  The combined population in the jurisdictions visited (2,713,242) represents 37% of the \nstate's population (7,293,542).  In addition, many of the people interviewed in our sample \njurisdictions were able to give us additional information about indigent defense in surrounding \nareas.  Many indigent defense lawyers accept appointments in multiple courts.  \n \n  The task of scheduling appointments to meet with individuals in 13 sites over a summer \nwas a daunting one.  The law firm of Covington & Burling graciously donated the time of three \nparalegals to conduct the majority of scheduling. In addition, the American Bar Association \nplayed an important administrative role mailing out explanatory letters about the project to \nindividuals contacted for interviews.  Copies of the letters appear in Appendix C. \n  \n  We greatly appreciate the time people spent meeting with us to speak about indigent \ndefense in Virginia.   \n  4\n\nTable 1-1 Jurisdictions Visited \n \nDistrict/Circuit  City/County  Courts  Public Defender? \nVisited \n23rd  Roanoke City  Roanoke City Circuit Court  Yes; covers the \nPopulation: 86,220  Roanoke County  Roanoke County Circuit Court  City of Roanoke \nRoanoke City GD \nRoanoke County GD \nRoanoke City JDR \nRoanoke County JDR \n24th  Lynchburg City  Lynchburg Circuit Court  Yes; covers the \nPopulation: 51,295  Campbell County  Lynchburg GD  City of Lynchburg \nRustburg, VA  Lynchburg JDR \nCampbell County Circuit Court \nCampbell GD \nCampbell JDR \n26th  Rockingham  Rockingham Circuit  Yes; covers the \nPopulation:  County,  Shenandoah Circuit  Counties of \n104,356  Harrisonburg, VA  Harrisonburg/Rockingham GD  Shenandoah, \nShenandoah  Harrisonburg/Rockingham JDR  Frederick, Page, \nCounty,  Shenandoah GD & JDR  and the City of \nWoodstock, VA    Winchester \n27th  Montgomery  Montgomery Circuit  Yes, covers the \nPopulation:  County,  Pulaski Circuit  Counties of \n118,166  Christiansburg, VA  Montgomery GD  Pulaski, Bland, \nPulaski County,  Montgomery JDR  Wythe and the \nPulaski, VA  Pulaski GD  City of Radford \nPulaski JDR \n29th  Tazewell County,  Tazewell Circuit  No \nPopulation: 74,273  Tazewell, VA  Russell Circuit \nRussell County,  Tazewell GD \nLebanon, VA  Tazewell JDR \nRussell GD & JDR \n31st  Prince William  Prince William Circuit  No \nPopulation:  County, Manassas,  Prince William GD \n298,707  VA  Prince William JDR \n4th  Norfolk City  Norfolk Circuit  Yes; covers City of \nPopulation:  Norfolk GD  Norfolk \n233,147  Norfolk JDR \n  5\n\nDistrict/Circuit  City/County  Courts  Public Defender? \nVisited \n7th  Newport News City  Newport News Circuit  No \n  Newport News GD – criminal \n  Newport News GD – traffic \nPopulation: 180,  Newport News JDR \n305 \n10th  Halifax County,  Halifax Circuit  Yes; covers the \n  Halifax, VA  Mecklenburg Circuit  Counties of \n  Mecklenburg  Halifax GD  Halifax, \n  County,  Halifax JDR  Mecklenburg and \n  Boydton, VA  Mecklenburg GD  Lunenburg \n  Mecklenburg JDR \nPopulation: 69,399   \n13th  Richmond City  Richmond City Circuit  Yes; covers the \n  Richmond Manchester GD  City of Richmond \n  Richmond GD Criminal \nPopulation:  Richmond JDR \n195,966 \n15th  Spotsylvania  Spotsylvania Circuit  Yes; covers the \n  County,  Hanover Circuit  Counties of \n  Spotsylvania, VA  Spotsylvania GD  Spotsylvania, King \n  Hanover County,  Spotsylvania JDR  George, Stafford \n  Hanover VA  Hanover GD  and the City of \n  Hanover JDR  Fredericksburg \nPopulation: 187, \n474 \n18th  Alexandria City  Alexandria Circuit  Yes; covers the \n  Alexandria GD  City of Alexandria \nPopulation:  Alexandria JDR \n128,773 \n19th  Fairfax, City and  Fairfax Circuit Court  Yes; covers they \n  County  Fairfax City GD  City and County of \n  Fairfax County GD  Fairfax \nPopulation: 985,  Fairfax JDR \n161 \n \n  6\n\nCHAPTER 2 \nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF VIRGINIA’S CURRENT INDIGENT \nDEFENSE SYSTEM \n  The deficiencies in Virginia’s indigent defense system are notorious and have persisted \ndespite production of numerous reports documenting the problems in the last three decades.  \nBeginning in 1971 and continuing to the present day, at least 33 studies have been conducted to \nevaluate indigent defense in Virginia.  These studies, which are summarized in detail in \nAppendix A, highlight several common themes.  The two most commonly reiterated findings \nare: 1) that Virginia’s compensation rates for court-appointed counsel are the lowest in the nation \nand should be raised; and 2) that the public defender system should be expanded.  The repeated \ncalls for reform to Virginia’s indigent defense system have been largely ignored by the \nlegislative, executive and judicial branches of Virginia state government.   \n \n  In 1971 the Virginia State Bar conducted a study that determined that Virginia’s \ncompensation schedules for court-appointed counsel did not meet the essential standard to assure \neffective assistance of counsel.  The study also found that court-appointed attorneys are \n“overworked, underpaid, inadequately trained, without adequate, if any, investigational resources \nand thus often unable to provide a full and aggressive defense.”  This sentiment continued to \nresonate throughout many of the reports produced over the next 32 years, including the present  \none.   \n \n  Findings that Virginia had the lowest compensation for court-appointed counsel in the \ncountry and/or that attorney compensation was unreasonably low, were repeated in at least 14 \nstudies between 1971 and 2002.  The studies repeatedly called for increases in fees for court-\nappointed attorneys and/or raising the statutorily imposed caps.  During conduct of the current \nstudy in 2003, not a single interviewee stated that the current compensation for court-appointed \ncounsel was adequate or fair. \n \n  Conducted prior to the opening of Virginia’s first public defender office, the State Bar’s \n1971 study suggested creating an indigent defense commission that would establish and oversee \npublic defender pilot programs.  The Public Defender Commission was created in 1972, and five \nstudies conducted between 1981 and 1986, four between 1989 and 1991, and one in 2002 all \nsuggested expansions of, and additions to, the public defender system, including establishing \neither a statewide appellate defender or capital defender offices.  A small appellate defender \noffice was authorized in 1996 and four capital defender offices were authorized in 2002.  To \ndate, 21 public defender offices, covering just 48 of 134 localities, have been opened. \n \n  While the General Assembly has been put on ample notice of the problems with indigent \ndefense in Virginia, and indeed solicited at least seven reports to be prepared on the subject, \nlegislative response to address the problems identified has been tepid at best. Illustrative actions \nby the General Assembly include: \n \n  7\n\n•  1972: creates the Public Defender Commission;  \n•   1982: rejects proposal to establish a public defender office in Alexandria and requests a \nfollow-up study on areas where public defender offices would be most cost-effective;  \n•  1983: institutes a cap on stacking payments to court-appointed counsel for defense of \nmultiple counts of the same offense; determines information was inadequate to document \nsavings or improved quality and refuses to approve of the establishment of public \ndefender offices in Richmond and Fairfax (offices were eventually created in these \ncities); \n•  1984: adjusts the cap on payment to court-appointed lawyers for defense of multiple \ncounts from one to three counts; \n•  1989: expands the public defender system by creating several new offices sought through \nlocal initiatives; increases court-appointed counsel case caps by 15 percent; \n•  1996: passes House Resolution No. 79, directing the Virginia State Crime Commission to \nstudy the cost effectiveness of both the court-appointed and public defender systems.  \nThe resolution stated, in part, “although the entire criminal justice system is suffering \nfrom a lack of adequate resources, the current level of funding for indigent defense has \nreached a crisis level;” \n•  1998: raises fee caps in Class III to Class VI felonies from $265 to $305, and Class II \nfelonies from $735 to $845, and in the second year of the biennium the same fees are \nraised by another 5%, to $318 and $882 respectively.  During the legislative process, Co-\nChair of the Senate Finance Committee comments that this was an issue he knew would \nneed to be addressed in coming years; and  \n•  1999: enacts a 24 percent increase to caps in all non-capital felony and misdemeanor \ncases; these caps remain in place today but the General Assembly has not appropriated \nenough money to fully fund them (see Table 6-1).  \n \n  State government in Virginia has repeatedly failed to take steps to ensure that federal \nconstitutional and state law requirements for counsel to indigent defendants are fulfilled. \nSpecifically, the state has not ensured that indigent defendants are provided with adequately \ncompensated court-appointed lawyers who have the necessary resources needed to provide an \nadequate and meaningful defense. It is hoped that this report, through its combination of in-\nperson interviews and in-depth data analysis, provides a new and ultimately persuasive \nperspective on the need to reform indigent defense in Virginia.   \n \n \n  8\n\nCHAPTER 3 \nVIRGINIA’S COURT SYSTEM \n  In order to understand the discussion of Virginia’s indigent defense system that appears \nin the subsequent chapters, it is useful to have an understanding of Virginia’s court system. \n \n  The Virginia judicial system is comprised of the Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals, \ncircuit courts in 31 judicial circuits, general district and juvenile and domestic relations district \ncourts in 32 districts, and magistrates in offices in 32 districts.  Three advisory/administrative \nbodies have been created by the legislature to aid in the operation of the court system: the \nJudicial Inquiry and Review Commission, the Judicial Council, and the Committee on District \nCourts. \n \n  Criminal jurisdiction in Virginia is vested in circuit courts, general district courts and \njuvenile and domestic relations courts.  Circuit courts are courts of record with general criminal \njurisdiction, while general district courts and juvenile and domestic relations courts are courts not \nof record and have limited criminal jurisdiction.  Appellate level courts in Virginia include the \nCourt of Appeals of Virginia, which provides intermediate review of circuit court decisions in \ntraffic infractions and criminal cases, except where a sentence of death has been imposed,7 and \nthe Virginia Supreme Court.8    All direct appeals in cases where a sentence of death has been \nimposed are heard by the Virginia Supreme Court. \n \n  The seven justices of the Supreme Court of Virginia are elected by a majority vote of \nboth houses of the General Assembly for a term of 12 years.  To be eligible for election, a \ncandidate must be a resident of Virginia and must have been a member of the Virginia Bar for at \nleast five years.  By statute, the Chief Justice is chosen by a majority vote of the seven justices.  \nThe Chief Justice has the responsibility of supervising the administration of the entire court \nsystem of the Commonwealth.9  \n \n  Article VI, Section 4 of the Constitution of Virginia places upon the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court of Virginia the responsibility of supervising the administration of the entire court \nsystem of the Commonwealth.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7 VA. CODE ANN. § 17.1-406.  Additionally, the Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction over administrative \nagency decisions, Virginia Worker’s Compensation Commission decisions, and certain domestic relations appeals.  \nVA. CODE ANN. § 17.1-405 \n8 See VA. CODE ANN. §§ 17.1-309-313 for a description of the original and appellate jurisdiction of the Virginia \nSupreme Court. \n9 VA. CONST. art. VI, §4.  \n  9\n\nCourts and Their Criminal Jurisdiction \n \n  General district courts (“GDCs”) hear misdemeanors,10 traffic infractions, and offenses \nagainst county or city ordinances.11  Additionally, a GDC may conduct preliminary hearings in \nfelony cases12 to determine whether there is enough evidence to justify holding the defendant for \na grand jury hearing.  There is no jury available in GDC.  Any person convicted of an offense in \nthe GDC has a right to appeal de novo the conviction to the circuit court, even if the conviction \nwas upon a guilty plea.13  A misdemeanant’s right to a jury trial is protected by this automatic \nappeal and a trial de novo in a court of record, where a jury trial is available.14 \n \n  Circuit court hears felonies where there has been an indictment or a presentment by a \ngrand jury or an information and has jurisdiction over juveniles aged fourteen and older who are \ncharged with felonies and whose cases have been certified by the judge of a juvenile and \ndomestic relations district court for trial in a circuit court.15  The circuit court also has appellate \njurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases originating in GDC and juvenile and domestic \nrelations district court. 16  Appeals from these district courts are heard de novo, that is, the cases \nare tried anew in circuit court as though they had never been heard in the lower court.17 \n \n  The juvenile and domestic relations district courts (J&DR courts) have original and \nexclusive jurisdiction over juveniles,18 defined as persons under the age of 18, accused of acts \nthat would be crimes if committed by an adult (misdemeanors and felonies), traffic violations,19 \nas well as status offense jurisdiction over a child who commits an act prohibited by law that \nwould not be a crime if committed by an adult.20  Once a child is transferred or certified for trial \nas an adult, and is convicted as an adult in the circuit court, the juvenile court will no longer have \njurisdiction to handle the youth as a juvenile for criminal acts that would otherwise constitute \ndelinquency.21  The juvenile court’s jurisdiction over a “violent juvenile felony” allegedly \ncommitted by a juvenile 14 or older is limited to the holding of a preliminary hearing unless the \nCommonwealth’s attorney elects not to give notice of intent to file in criminal court.22  Any \n                                                 \n10 Circuit Courts have concurrent jurisdiction to try misdemeanors where there has been an indictment of a \npresentment by a grand jury or an information.  VA. CODE ANN. § 16.1-126.  An indictment is a written accusation \nof crime, prepared by the attorney for the Commonwealth and returned as a “true bill” by a legally impaneled grand \njury.  VA. CODE ANN. § 19.2-216.  A presentment is a written accusation of a crime prepared and returned by the \ngrand jury from their own knowledge or observation, without any bill of indictment laid before them.  Id.  An \ninformation is a written accusation prepared and presented by a competent public official upon his oath of office.  Id. \n11 VA. CODE ANN. § 16.1-123.1. \n12 VA. CODE ANN. § 16.1-127. \n13 VA.

CODE ANN. § 16.2-269.1(B)-C). \n  10\n\njuvenile convicted in circuit court after being transferred or certified will be treated as an adult in \nall future criminal cases.23 \n \n  The juvenile and domestic relations court also has jurisdiction over adults in abuse and \nneglect cases, custody and support cases and a number of other matters related to juveniles, \nfamily members or household members.24  Where an adult is charged with committing a felony \nagainst children or family members, the juvenile court is limited to conducting a preliminary \nhearing to determine if there is probable cause.  If probable cause is found, the case is transferred \nto circuit court; otherwise the case is dismissed or reduced to a misdemeanor and disposed of in \nGDC or J&DR court.25 \n \nCrime Definitions \n \n  A felony is defined in Virginia as “such offenses as are punishable with death or \nconfinement in a state correctional facility”26 and are punishable for not less than one year.27  All \nother offenses are misdemeanors28 and are punishable by confinement in jail for not more than \n12 months and/or a fine.29  Traffic infractions are violations of public order and are not deemed \ncriminal in nature.30 \n   \nStructure of the Courts \n \n  Virginia has 32 judicial districts and 31 judicial circuits; districts and circuits are the \nsame with the exception that the Eastern Shore, composed of Accomack and Northampton \ncounties, is part of the same circuit as the City of Virginia Beach, but has its own district.31  \nThere is a GDC and a J&DR court in every city and county of the state.32  However, some \nlocalities have combined the functions of the general district court and the juvenile and domestic \nrelations court into a single court called the “combined district court.”  There is no longer a \nsystem of local municipal courts that operate separately from the state district courts.33 \n \nCourt Funding \n \n  Funding for the court system in Virginia is provided by both the Commonwealth, through \nstate appropriations, for salaries of judges and clerks, and by localities, which bear a portion of \nthe financial burden in providing courthouses and accommodations for the courts. \n                                                 \n23 VA.

In addition, the salaries of the court \nclerks of both district37 and circuit courts38 are paid by the state.39  Localities are required to \nprovide suitable quarters and equipment for the general district court and juvenile courts40 and \ncourthouses with suitable space and facilities to accommodate the various courts and officials, \nincluding the Commonwealth’s attorney but not including the public defender’s office.41 In \naddition, the locality provides assorted supplies and equipment necessary to conduct the business \nof the courts of record.42 \n                                                 \n34 South Carolina is the only other state besides Virginia that uses a legislative judicial selection process without a \nnominating commission.

Alabama.44  In Powell, the Court held that it was a violation of due \nprocess for a state court to fail to appoint counsel in a capital case.  The Court reasoned: \n  \nEven the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in \nthe science of law.  If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of \ndetermining  for  himself  whether  the  indictment  is  good  or  bad.    He  is \nunfamiliar with the rules of evidence.  Left without the aid of counsel he may \nbe put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent \nevidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible....He \nrequires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against \nhim.  Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction \nbecause he does not know how to establish his innocence.45   \n \nIn a collection of subsequent opinions, the Court expanded and repeatedly stressed the \nfundamental importance of court-appointed counsel for accused, not just in capital cases, but in \nall criminal cases involving a possible loss of liberty.  \n \n  In Johnson v. Zerbst,46 the Supreme Court recognized that “without the assistance of \ncounsel even the intelligent layman usually lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to \nprepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one.”47  Johnson held that the Sixth \nAmendment requires the federal government to appoint counsel for criminal defendants who are \nunable to obtain counsel themselves, who have not waived their constitutional right to counsel, \nand whose life or liberty is in jeopardy.   \n \n  The seminal case of Gideon v. Wainwright48 built on Johnson by holding that an indigent \ncriminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel is a fundamental right \nnecessary to ensure the right to a fair trial and the fundamental human rights of life and liberty. \nGideon further held that the right to appointed counsel applies to the states under the due process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n \n                                                 \n43 “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to…have the assistance of counsel for his defense.”  \nU.S. CONST. amend.  VI. \n44 287 U.S. 45 (1932). \n45 Id. at 68-69. \n46 304 U.S. 458, 468 (1938). \n47 Johnson, 304 U.S. at 468. \n48 372 U.S. 335, 344-45 (1963). \n  13\n\n  While Gideon clearly established the right to counsel in felony cases, it was Argersinger \nv. Hamlin49 that clarified that the right extended to misdemeanor cases.  In Argersinger, the \nCourt held that an indigent defendant, sentenced to three months imprisonment as a result of a \nmisdemeanor conviction, was denied due process by not being afforded counsel.  In Justice \nDouglas’ majority opinion, the Court held that “absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no \nperson may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, \nunless he was represented by counsel at his trial.”50  \n \n  Although Argersinger explicitly held that the right to counsel applied to any criminal \ndefendant who is sentenced to incarceration, the question remained whether this right to counsel \nextended to cases where incarceration is authorized, but not actually imposed. The Supreme \nCourt addressed that question seven years later in Scott v. Illinois,51 a case that represented the \nstate of the right to counsel in misdemeanor cases until Alabama v. Shelton.  In Scott, the issue \nwas whether the right to counsel applied to cases where imprisonment is authorized by statute, \nbut not actually imposed upon a defendant.  In the majority opinion written by the then Associate \nJustice Rehnquist, the Court held that the mere threat of imprisonment does not justify the \nrequirement of counsel.  The Court reaffirmed its earlier decision in Argersinger, but stated that \nthe central premise of Argersinger involved actual imprisonment, and not the mere threat of \nimprisonment. Based upon this standard of “actual imprisonment,” the Court in Scott v. Illinois \nrefused to extend the right to counsel to cases where imprisonment is authorized but not actually \nimposed. \n \n  In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court modified its opinion in Scott v. Illinois.  In Alabama v. \nShelton, a divided Court held that “a suspended sentence that may ‘end up in the actual \ndeprivation of a person’s liberty’ may not be imposed unless the defendant was accorded ‘the \nguiding hand of counsel’ in the prosecution for the crime charged.”52  In essence, the decision \nextended the right to counsel by holding that a defendant may not serve actual jail time unless \nthe defendant was provided or offered the assistance of counsel in the prosecution which was the \noriginal source of the incarceration (i.e., the underlying offense for which a probated or \nsuspended sentence was received).53 \n \nRight to Counsel in Virginia \n \n  Federal law, including the U.S. Constitution and federal case law, provides the minimal \nrequirements that every state and locality must follow when setting up individual indigent \ndefense systems. States are free to create even broader protections and rights than the federal \n                                                 \n49 407 U.S. 25 (1972). \n50 Id. at 37. \n51 440 U.S. 367 (1979). \n52 Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002) (quoting Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 40 (1972)). \n53 Shelton dealt with cases where the trial judge sentences a defendant to a term of imprisonment and suspends the \nsentence and/or places that individual on probation.  See id.  If the defendant complies with the terms of the \nsuspended sentence and/or probation, the defendant serves no jail time.  However, if the defendant fails to comply \nwith the suspended or probated sentence (e.g., commits a new offense or fails to meet all of the terms of probation), \nthe suspended sentence may be imposed or probation may be revoked up to the maximum term of imprisonment for \nthe underlying offense. \n  14\n\ngovernment requires, such as additional types of cases or proceedings in which indigent persons \nhave a right to appointed counsel, but absent stronger state provisions, federal law controls and \nsupercedes state law.  \n \n  The right to counsel is not explicitly guaranteed in Virginia’s Constitution but \nthe Virginia Supreme Court first acknowledged the practice of judges appointing lawyers to \nrepresent indigent defendants in 189554 and later explicitly held the right of counsel to be \nfundamental under the Virginia Constitution in 1940.55  The contours of the right to counsel in \ncriminal cases in Virginia are shaped by federal constitutional law,56 along with specific \nprovisions of the Virginia Code. \n \n  Absent a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel, no person may be imprisoned for a \ncriminal offense without the assistance of counsel.  The general rule applies to felonies as well as \nto misdemeanor prosecutions.57  In misdemeanor cases, if, upon motion of the Commonwealth’s \nAttorney, the court states in writing that a jail sentence will not be imposed if the defendant is \nconvicted, the court may try the case without appointing counsel, and in such event, no jail \nsentence may be imposed.58  In the absence of the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s motion, a court \nmay proceed on its own motion.59 \n \nRight to Counsel in Virginia’s Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court \n \n  The right to be represented by a lawyer in juvenile and domestic relations district court \nextends to: \n \n•  juveniles involved in delinquency cases; \n•  juveniles in need of services; \n•  juveniles in need of supervision; \n•  abused and neglected juveniles; \n•  any juvenile who is the subject of a custody, visitation or support controversy; \n•  adults before the court on criminal charges; \n                                                 \n54 Barnes v. Commonwealth, 92 Va. 794, 803 (1895). \n55 Watkins v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 518 (1940). \n56 To expand upon the discussion in the previous section, the right has been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court \nto apply to the following types of cases: Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, (1932) (death penalty); Gideon v. \nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, (1963) (felony trials); Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963) (direct appeals); \nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1967) (custodial interrogation); In re Gault;  387 U.S. 1 (1967) (juvenile \nproceedings resulting in confinement); U.S. v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967) (lineups); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. \n263 (1967) (critical stages of preliminary hearings); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970) (preliminary hearings); \nArgersinger v.

However, a lawyer will be appointed for adults \nonly in criminal cases, abuse and neglect cases, and termination of residual parental rights cases.  \nParents or guardians of juveniles or other adults receiving a court-appointed lawyer who, upon \nfurther investigation, are found able to pay will be charged the cost of a lawyer’s services.  Use \nof a lawyer is not required in all cases; the right to a lawyer may be waived by the accused \nexcept when the interests of the accused juvenile and his parents are in conflict.63 \n \n \nStandards, Guidelines and Code of Professional Responsibility Provisions \nPertaining to Adequate Representation of Criminal Defendants \n \n  In rendering services to clients, criminal defense lawyers must practice under various \nconstitutional and statutory mandates as well as their particular state’s rules of professional \nresponsibility (in Virginia, this is the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct).  In addition, \ncriminal defense attorneys are urged to follow accepted national standards.  In the past 15 years, \nthe adoption of standards and guidelines has been one of the most notable developments in the \ndelivery of indigent defense services.  Standards and guidelines pertaining to attorney \nperformance, attorney eligibility, caseloads, conflict of interest, indigency screening, and \nadministration of indigent defense systems have been adopted by: state and local legislation; \nstate supreme court rule; national, state and local public defender organizations, indigent defense \ncommissions and other entities.   \n   \n  At the national level, the clear leader in this effort has been the American Bar Association \n(ABA).  The ABA has promulgated standards for criminal justice involving all the components \nof the justice system including indigent defense.  Chapter 4 of those standards addresses the \ncriminal defense function.  Chapter 5 addresses the delivery of indigent defense services.  The \n                                                 \n60 VA.

CODE ANN. § 16.1-266.1. \n62 Id. \n63 Id.  \n  16\n\nABA has promulgated standards which address the processing of death penalty,64 juvenile \ndelinquency65 and juvenile abuse and neglect cases.66  Another national leader in promulgating \nwell thought-out, thorough standards has been the National Legal Aid and Defender Association \n(NLADA), which has published guidelines for awarding contracts to contract defenders,67 \nstandards for the administration of assigned counsel systems68 and performance standards that set \nout minimum requirements of practice for lawyers representing indigent defendants.69   \n   \n  National standards and guidelines serve a number of important purposes.  While neither \nthe ABA's nor the NLADA's standards are expressly binding on state or local programs, they do \nserve as a measure to judge the extent to which an individual organization provides quality \nindigent defense services.  Most states that adopted indigent defense standards and guidelines \nhave modeled them after these national documents, tailoring them to local practice.  In capital \ncases, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the ABA Standards and Guidelines concerning \nrepresentation in death penalty cases are “well-defined norms”70 and have “long [been] referred \n[to] as ‘guides to determining what is reasonable’”71 when evaluating whether assistance \nprovided by defense counsel was ineffective.   \n \n  The national standards that set forth the requirements of defense counsel give meaning to \nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The standards include a set of requirements that counsel \nshould follow in all cases, plus additional requirements that should be required whenever \nnecessary and appropriate.  Just as criminal cases vary endlessly in their details, jurisdictions \nvary in practice and procedure.  To differentiate standards of practice that are absolutely \nnecessary in all cases as opposed to those that are required where appropriate, the introduction to \nthe NLADA Performance Guidelines states: \n  \nThe  language  of  these  Guidelines  is…general,  implying  flexibility  of \naction  by  counsel  appropriate  to  the  situation.    Use  of  judgment  in \ndeciding upon a particular course of action is reflected by the phrases \n“should consider” and “where appropriate.”  In those instances where \n                                                 \n64 ABA GUIDELINES FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF DEFENSE COUNSEL IN DEATH PENALTY CASES \n(Rev Ed.

The \ninvestigation should be conducted as soon as possible.  \n•  Counsel has the duty to pursue, as soon as practicable, discovery procedures \nprovided by the rules of the jurisdiction and to pursue such informal discovery \nmethods as may be available to supplement the factual investigation of the case. \n•  Counsel has an obligation to prepare the case and develop a theory of the case. \n•  Counsel has the obligation to keep the client informed of the progress of the case \nand all available options.  \n•  Counsel should explore with the client the possibility and desirability of reaching \na negotiated plea rather than proceeding to trial.  Counsel should fully explain the \nrights that are waived by entering a plea rather than proceeding to trial. \n•  The decision to proceed to trial with or without a jury rests solely with the client.  \nCounsel should discuss the relevant strategic considerations of this decision with \nthe client. \n                                                 \n72 72 vi-vii, National Legal Aid and Defender Association, Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense \nRepresentation (1995). \n \n  18\n\n•  Counsel should be fully prepared for all hearings and for trial. \n•  Counsel should not accept excessive workloads that will interfere with quality \nrepresentation. \n•  Counsel should be alert to all potential and actual conflicts of interest that would \nimpair counsel's ability to properly represent the client. \n•  Where the client is entitled to a preliminary hearing, counsel should take steps to \nsee that the hearing is conducted in a timely manner unless there are strategic \nreasons for not doing so. \n•  Counsel should develop a sentencing plan which seeks to achieve the least \nrestrictive and burdensome sentencing alternative that is most acceptable to the \nclient, and which can reasonably be obtained based on the facts and circumstances \nof the offense, the defendant’s background, the applicable sentencing provisions \nand other information pertinent to the sentencing decision.  \n•  Counsel should be familiar with the procedure concerning the preparation, \nsubmission and verification of the pre-sentence investigation report or similar \ndocuments. \n•  Counsel should inform the defendant of his or her right to appeal the judgment of \nthe court and the action that must be taken to perfect the appeal. \n \n  A measure of an adequately functioning indigent defense system is an evaluation of \nwhether indigent defense counsel are able to follow these requirements in all cases handled.  \nUnfortunately, during the course of our study, it was apparent that many private court-appointed \ncounsel and public defenders in Virginia fell far short of meeting these requirements, placing \nindigent defendants in the position where neither the courts nor the government could assure \ntheir rights required under federal and state law.   \n \n  The following three chapters set out serious problems with Virginia’s indigent defense \nsystem.  Chapter 5 discusses the Commonwealth’s public defender system, Chapter 6 discusses \nthe assigned counsel system, and Chapter 7 addresses factors affecting the practice of both public \ndefenders and assigned counsel in Virginia.  \n  19\n\nCHAPTER 5 \nINDIGENT DEFENSE IN VIRGINIA: PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES \n  Our nine-month investigation into Virginia’s indigent defense system revealed that public \ndefenders are forced to confront excessive caseloads with woefully inadequate resources.  Public \ndefenders throughout Virginia handle caseloads far in excess of nationally recognized annual \nworkload standards, leaving them unable to devote the necessary time and attention to many \ncases.  Underfunding of public defender offices leaves them without the most basic of office \nequipment, such as functioning computers, fax machines and internet access, and insufficient \nsecretarial, paralegal and investigative staff.  While caseloads of public defender offices continue \nto rise, budgets for the offices remain relatively static, and well below that provided to \nCommonwealth’s attorneys’ offices.  \n \nIndigent Defense Providers in Virginia  \n \n  Indigent defense services in Virginia are provided by a combination of public defender \noffices, which serve 48 of 134 localities,73 and assigned counsel, which provide representation in \nall localities of the Commonwealth.  In jurisdictions that have public defender offices, public \ndefenders are expected to represent all indigents within their jurisdiction who are charged with \ncrimes or offenses and are entitled by law to court-appointed counsel unless a conflict exists or \nthey are otherwise relieved by the court.74  In areas without public defender offices, assigned \ncounsel provide representation in all indigent defendant cases and in areas with public defenders \nassigned counsel handle any case the public defender office does not handle.  Public defenders \ndo not serve as guardians ad litem (GALs) at all; only private, court-appointed attorneys serve as \nGALs.   \n \n  Attorneys representing non-capital indigent defendants in Virginia, whether public \ndefenders or assigned counsel, are subject to very few minimum standards or guidelines.  The \nonly statewide requirement we are aware of applies to public defenders.  According to a Public \nDefender Commission policy, public defenders are expected to meet with incarcerated clients \nwithin 48 hours of appointment.  Some districts have developed a similar local rule for court-\nappointed attorneys.  For example, in Fairfax, court-appointed attorneys are expected to meet \ndetained clients within 48 hours of appointment, and in Hanover County, attorneys are expected \nto meet with detained clients within 72 hours of appointment. \n \n  Attorneys accepting GAL appointments are subject to more standards than are attorneys \nassigned to criminal or juvenile delinquency cases.  Since 1995, all attorneys serving as GALs in \nthe courts of Virginia for children in child protection, custody and visitation, juvenile \ndelinquency (some children represented by counsel in delinquency proceedings also have \nGALs), CHINS, status offense and other appropriate cases, as determined by the court, have \nbeen required to undergo initial training to get on the appointment list and are subject to \n                                                 \n73 Virginia localities consist of 95 counties and 39 independent cities. \n74 VA. CODE ANN. § 19.2-163.4. \n  20\n\nminimum qualification standards.75  Effective September 1, 2003, GALs must also adhere to \nminimum performance standards.76  \n \n  The balance of this chapter provides information on the operation of public defender \noffices we visited in Virginia. The following chapter provides similar information on assigned \ncounsel programs that we reviewed. \n \nCall for a Public Defender System  \n \n  In 1970, the Board of Governors of the Criminal Law Section, Virginia State Bar, \nconducted a study of the methods of providing counsel for indigents at public expense and \nwhether a public defender system should be considered.  Up until this time, all legal \nrepresentation of indigent defendants had been provided by private court-appointed counsel.  In \n1971, the Bar report was completed, recommending, among other things, creation of an indigent \ndefense commission to establish pilot public defender programs in several areas of the \nCommonwealth.  The report stated that, “Escalating crime statistics have brought demands to get \ntough with criminals and at the same time increasing concern for protection and constitutional \nrights.”77   \n \n  The then Attorney General, who had encouraged the study, remarked: “the representation \ngiven to some individuals (under the assigned counsel system) is not as adequate as it should be. \n. . .At the October (1970) term of the Virginia Supreme Court, three out of seven criminal \nappeals were affirmed simply because constitutional issues raised at the appellate level were not \nproperly brought forth at the trial court level.”  The 1972 General Assembly voiced its approval \nof the State Bar study by enacting legislation establishing a Public Defender Commission (PDC). \n \nThe Public Defender System Today  \n \n  Twenty-one public defender offices currently operate in Virginia, serving 48 localities. \nThe Public Defender Commission is authorized to recommend to the General Assembly areas in \nwhich a public defender office should be established, however, no office will be created without \nstrong support from the locality and an authorizing vote by the General Assembly.  Opposition to \nnew public defender offices is common.  In 2003, a lawyer in Newport News who takes court \nappointed cases circulated a letter to fellow panel members urging them to support political \ncandidates who opposed creation of a public defender office, to avoid losing the “meal tickets” \nof indigent defendants for their local practices.78   \n \n  Public defender offices serve all sizes of jurisdictions, from large (Fairfax, Richmond, \nVirginia Beach) to very small (Pulaski).  In most states with a statewide public defender system, \n                                                 \n75 Standards to Govern the Appointment of Guardians Ad Litem. \n76 Standards to Govern the Performance of Guardians Ad Litem for Children. \n77 See Overton Pollard, Providing Defense Services to Indigents in Virginia: The Public Defender Program, Va. \nState Bar, Pro Bono/Access to Legal Services (quoting 1971 Report of the Board of Governors, Criminal Law \nSection, Virginia State Bar), at http://www.vsb.org/probono/indigent_defense.html (last visited Dec. 19, 2003). \n78 See The Daily Press, March 26, 2003, Terry Scanlon, “Memo Comes Back to Bite Area Lawyer.”  \n  21\n\npublic defender offices tend to serve the largest metropolitan areas, while smaller areas are \nserved by regional public defender offices or by assigned counsel.  In Virginia, there appears to \nbe no pattern to the establishment of public defender offices.  Instead, the offices are situated in a \nhodge podge fashion throughout the state.  Six of the offices serve communities of fewer than \n10,000 residents.79  In our site work, we visited 10 public defender offices, ranging in size from \nfive attorneys in Pulaski to 24 attorneys in Richmond.80   \n \n  Expansion of the public defender system occurred primarily between 1986 and 1992. \nDuring this period 15 new offices and one satellite office were opened, bringing the number of \noffices statewide to 19.  Since 1992, additional offices were opened in Charlottesville and \nNorfolk.  The General Assembly has been urged to authorize creation of offices in several other \nareas but it has not acted on the recommendations.  \n \n  Sec. 19.2-163.4 of the Virginia Code provides: “In counties and cities in which public \ndefender offices are established…, defense services for indigents charged with jailable offenses \nshall be provided by the public defenders unless (i) the public defender is unable to represent the \ndefendant or petitioner by reason of conflict of interest or (ii) the court finds that appointment of \nother counsel is necessary to attain the ends of justice.”  The Public Defender Commission’s goal \nis that public defender offices serve 75 percent of all indigent cases in the jurisdictions they \nserve.  However, the Commission seems interested in achieving this goal regardless of whether \nsufficient resources are available to the local offices, bringing into question whether the goal \n“attains the ends of justice.”  \n \n  In 1997 the Supreme Court of Virginia Office of the Executive Secretary surveyed courts \nserved by public defender offices to determine what percentage of indigent defendants were \nrepresented by public defenders as opposed to assigned counsel.81  Eighty-nine courts responded \nto the survey.  The following table illustrates the percentage of indigent defendants that courts \nreported were represented by the public defender offices serving their jurisdiction. \n \n                                                 \n79 These small communities include Franklin City (population 8,170), Rappahannock County (population 7,206), \nBland (population 6,919), Lexington (population 6,910), Buena Vista (population 6,306), and Bedford City \n(population 6,257).  \n80 Public defender offices were visited in the following cities: Alexandria, Fairfax, Fredericksburg, Halifax, \nLynchburg, Norfolk, Pulaski, Richmond and Roanoke.  In addition, we visited the Appellate Defender Office and \nthe Central Capital Defender Office in Richmond.   \n81 Supreme Court of Virginia Office of the Executive Secretary, Court Appointed Counsel and Public Defenders in \nVirginia: Study of Procedures for the Appointment and “Fair” Rotation of Counsel in Virginia’s Courts (1998). \n  22\n\nResponses from 1998 Study of Procedures for the Appointment and \n“Fair” Rotation of Counsel in Virginia’s Courts \n \nPercentage of Indigent Cases  Number of Courts \nHandled by Public Defender \n95-100 %  35 \n90-94%  30 \n85-89%    9 \n80-84%  6 \n<80%    9 \n \n \nThus, 80 of the 89 reporting courts indicated that public defenders handle in excess of 80 percent \nof the indigent defendant cases in their courts.  These data are consistent with our findings of \nsignificant case overload for public defenders in virtually every office in the state. \n \nThe Public Defender Commission  \n \n  The Virginia Public Defender Commission’s nine members are appointed by the Speaker \nof the House of Delegates in consultation with the Chairmen of the Courts of Justice Committees \nof the House of Delegates and the Senate.  Membership includes three judges - two judges from \ncourts of record and one general district court judge - three lawyers and three laypeople.  The  \nPublic Defender Commission (PDC) appoints one member as chairperson.  \n \n  Virginia Code Section 19.2-163.2 sets out the duties of the PDC, which include hiring an \nExecutive Director. Overton Pollard held this position since the PDC was created until he retired \nin October 2003, when former Deputy Director Richard Goemann assumed the position. The \nPDC administrative staff consists of 12 people. \n  \n  The Commission is responsible for hiring a public defender for each of the areas in which \na public defender office has been authorized by the General Assembly.  Initially, just three \noffices were authorized: one serving Augusta County and the cities of Staunton and Waynesboro, \none serving Virginia Beach, and one serving the City of Roanoke. Following positive review of \nthese pilot offices, additional offices have been gradually authorized.82  There are currently 21 \npublic defender offices serving 48 localities, which encompass 30% of the state’s population.  \n                                                 \n82 Various reports have supported expansion of the public defender system in Virginia, including the Judicial \nCouncil of Virginia’s 1983-1986 Comprehensive Judicial Plan.  Goal 1 of the Plan was: “To improve the ability of \nthe courts to provide a prompt and fair resolution in all legal disputes.”  Within that Goal, the Counsel included the \nfollowing Task:  \n \nTask 1.3.3  Support legislation to establish that, as a matter of public policy, Virginia will proceed \ntoward a state-wide implementation of a mixed defender system (primary responsibility for \nhandling indigent cases going to salaried public defenders with the private bar handling conflict \nand overflow cases).  \n \n  23\n\n \n  In 1996, the Commission authorized creation of an appellate defender unit, which is \nhoused in the PDC’s Richmond offices.  The Appellate Defender, who is hired by the \nCommission, and two staff attorneys assist the public defender offices with petitions, briefs and \narguments in the Virginia Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Virginia.  The PDC is also \nresponsible for hiring four regional capital defenders, positions that were authorized in 2002.83  \nIndividuals appointed to each of these positions serve at the pleasure of the Commission and \nmust devote themselves full-time to public defender duties and not engage in the private practice \nof law.  (Some offices, however, employ part-time assistant public defenders who are permitted \nto engage in private practice when not performing public defender duties.) It is up to individual \npublic defenders to employ staff, including assistant public defenders, secretarial and \ninvestigative personnel, and to secure office space and supplies, as authorized by the General \nAssembly. \n \n  In addition to supervising and supporting the public defender, appellate public defender \nand capital defender offices, the Commission is charged with establishing standards for the \nqualification of counsel appointed in capital cases and maintaining lists of counsel, both public \ndefenders and court-appointed attorneys, for use by the circuit courts. This responsibility is \ncarried out in conjunction with the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Virginia State Bar. The \nstandards were initially effective on July 1, 1992 and have been updated twice, most recently in \nJanuary 2002. Standards for capital trial, direct appeal and habeas corpus counsel are posted at \nthe Commission’s website.  \n \n  Funds for Virginia’s public defender system come from a state appropriation made to the \nPublic Defender Commission.  Funds for compensating court-appointed attorneys and for paying \nany court-ordered expenses in indigent defendant cases, whether for public defenders or court-\nappointed attorneys, come from the Criminal Fund, which is administered by the Supreme Court. \nCourt-ordered expenses include expert witnesses, investigators, interpreters and other costs. \n \n  Thirty-two states, including Virginia, plus the District of Columbia, have some sort of \nstatewide body or commission responsible for developing policy and providing oversight for \nindigent defense services. 84  The Virginia Public Defender Commission is the only such entity \nwhere all of the members are appointed by the legislature. In other states, it is not uncommon for \nthe Senate and the House to provide advice and consent for selection of members who are \nultimately appointed by the Governor, or for appointments to be spread among multiple office-\nholders, such as the Chairs of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees in addition to the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nFurther, the Commission on the Future of the Judiciary and the 1989 Virginia Assembly recommended establishing \nstatewide Public Defender offices as primary defense services providers.  Most recently, House Document No. 32, a \n2002 report by the Virginia State Crime Commission, advocated creation of public defender offices in six areas.  \nThe General Assembly, however, only authorized one additional office in Norfolk   \n83 See VA. CODE ANN. § 19.2-163.2. \n84 In a few states, the indigent defense commission is only responsible for appellate cases.  In some states with \nstatewide public defender programs, the commission is only responsible for public defender offices, while another \nprogram or no program oversees assigned counsel programs.  See Statewide Indigent Defense Systems: 2001, \nprepared by the American Bar Association Bar Information Program, on the ABA’s website for the Standing \nCommittee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/sclaid/defender.html.  \n  24\n\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Governor.  Historically, we were told, membership \non the Virginia Public Defender Commission has not included individuals who are strong \nadvocates for indigent defense, such as well-respected criminal defense lawyers.  \n \n  In most states, indigent defense commissions were created to provide independent \noversight and accountability for indigent defense services, to develop uniform standards and \nguidelines for program operation, and to advocate for adequate resources in order to deliver \nindigent defense services.85  In contrast, we were told that the Public Defender Commission in \nVirginia has been timid about advocating for adequate resource needs.  Indeed, it seems the \nCommission has taken pride in the repeated battle cry that it can provide representation to \nindigent defendants cheaper than court-appointed counsel. With compensation rates for court-\nappointed counsel that are lower than any other state, and a Public Defender Commission that \nseems content to ask attorneys to do more with less, the question arises, how effectively can \neither public defenders or court-appointed attorneys represent their clients?  A substantial \nnumber of individuals we interviewed concluded that the answer is that they cannot be effective \nin all cases.  \n   \n  Public defenders in the past have been discouraged from directly contacting the Public \nDefender Commission to request additional resources. At one point, an assistant public defender \nwe interviewed who had a caseload of about 250 pending cases (felonies, misdemeanors and \ntraffic cases) wrote the Executive Director of the Public Defender Commission about his heavy \ncaseload, noting that it far exceeded national caseload standards and requesting relief (he had \nread an article about defender caseloads in the National Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers magazine, The Champion).  He received a polite letter back saying essentially that \nthings were not going to get any better in terms of caseload.  A number of chief public defenders \nreported that the Commission had discouraged them from seeking supplemental funds from cities \nor counties or seeking relief from serious case overload from their local courts.   \n \nPublic Defender Commission Budget Development   \n \n  The annual PDC budget is submitted to the Department of Planning & Budget where it is \nreviewed.  It is usually submitted in two parts: (a) the current PDC budget, which is what is \nnecessary to sustain current levels of services; and (b) a budget for new money the PDC feels is \nneeded to expand and provide improved services.  The (a) section is developed by the PDC’s \nFiscal Director. The (b) section is developed by the Executive Director, in consultation with the \nDeputy and Fiscal directors.  We are told that section (a) usually winds up in the governor's \nbudget and passes through the General Assembly.  Section (b) items, at least in recent years, \nhave not made it into the governor's budget and no efforts have been made to find legislative \nchampions to request these increases.   \n \n                                                 \n85 For a discussion of the role of indigent defense commissions, see Kate Jones, The Case for Commissions, THE \nCHAMPION (June 2001) at http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/ChampionArticles/2001jun01?opendocument. \n \n \n  25\n\n  Historically, when a new public defender office is to be opened, in order to determine the \nstaffing needed for the new office, Commission staff examine several factors informally, such as \nthe size and staff of the Commonwealth’s attorney office for the specific locality or localities to \nbe served, local crime trends and criminal filings, and the size of other public defender offices of \ncomparable size in the state.  Also, as previously mentioned, the Commission seeks to ensure \nthat staff  provide representation in at least 75 percent of the appointed cases in a given \njurisdiction.  The Commission’s proposed staffing plan is subject to cuts by the executive or \nlegislative branches.  Recently, the General Assembly cut four attorney positions from the public \ndefender’s office in Norfolk, which was the most recently opened office.  Also, in the past, the \nGeneral Assembly has on occasion granted requests for additional attorneys, but has not included \nmoney for additional support staff. \n \n  It has not just been the failure of the General Assembly to provide adequate funding for \npublic defenders; the Public Defender Commission itself has failed to aggressively seek adequate \nfunds.  It appears that some members of the Commission have been more concerned that public \ndefender offices service 75 percent of all the appointments in their jurisdictions than assuring \nthat clients receive adequate and quality representation. \n \n  In the past, not only have individual public defenders been strongly discouraged from \ncontacting Commission members directly about budget needs or other matters, they were also \nnot encouraged to meet with city or county governmental officials to seek local budget \nsupplements.  They were also dissuaded from meeting and greeting legislators who represent \ntheir jurisdictions.  In a change of course, the new executive director is encouraging public \ndefenders to meet their legislators in an effort to educate them regarding what public defenders \ndo and on the need for increased resources for the system as a whole.  To avoid competition \namong the offices, public defenders are not permitted to make resource requests on behalf of \ntheir individual offices to the General Assembly.   \n \nCharacteristics of Public Defender Offices  \n \n  In most communities we visited, the chief public defender was acknowledged as being a \nwell-respected lawyer.  Staff, however, were often described as eager, but young and \ninexperienced.  Given the heavy caseload demands on the offices, new attorneys, even those with \nno past experience, quickly take on full caseloads.  In most offices, most staff attorneys are \nclearly devoted to their work, although few assistant public defenders remain in their positions \nfor more than a few years.  Usually this is because of low pay, but it is also due to high caseloads \nand inadequate resources.  One attorney who worked less than two years as a public defender in \nLoudon County said 18 months in a public defender office is a long time.  At the time he left, \nfour years was the longest any attorneys had stayed with the office.  In Richmond, the chief \npublic defender told us that attorneys typically leave the office after about five years.  “The \nproblem for the system is too few resources: it grinds good people to dust.”   \n \n  According to the Public Defender Commission, excluding the Norfolk office, which just \nopened in 2002, 25 percent of the public defender staff attorneys statewide have been with the \n  26\n\noffices less than two years, and another 40 percent have been with the offices less than five \nyears.  \n \nCase Overload \n \n  In every office we visited, public defenders labor under excessive caseloads.  In \nLynchburg, for example, assistant public defenders average 100 open cases; the chief public \ndefender carries an average of 75 cases.  In Roanoke, all attorneys, including the chief public \ndefender, carry full caseloads, averaging between 115 and 180 open cases.  A Winchester public \ndefender reported she had 98 cases pending and had closed 372 cases in the first six months of \n2003. When we visited Norfolk, the public defender office had been open for less than one year, \nbut the average open caseload among full-time attorneys in the office was 116 (this excludes \ntraffic cases, which the office does not handle). The chief public defender’s open caseload was \n105 cases.  In Norfolk we were told that felony cases turn over approximately every three \nmonths.  Thus, an attorney carrying an open caseload with 100 felonies would handle 400 \nfelonies a year, two and a half times national caseload standards.  In addition, this attorney would \nalso be handling misdemeanors and appeals, as public defenders in Virginia carry caseloads with \nmixed case types. \n \n  Table 5-1 provides data on the total caseload for each of the public defender offices in FY \n2002 and the average caseload per attorney.  Three offices - Franklin/Suffolk, Halifax and \nAlexandria - had average annual caseloads of under 400 cases per attorney. Statewide, however, \nthe average number of cases handled by public defenders in FY 2002 was 507.  An average \nannual caseload of 507 cases (appeals, felonies, delinquencies and misdemeanors combined) \nexceeds that permitted in most other public defender programs in the country.  See Table 5-2, \nbelow, for annual workload standards developed for other public defender programs in the \ncountry. \n  27\n\n \n \nTable 5-1 \nFY 2002 Public Defender Annual Average Caseload by Office  \n        \nAverage \nNumber of  Number of  Attorney \nDistrict  PD Office  Attorneys  Cases  Caseload \n26  Winchester  6.5 4,379  673.69 \n25  Staunton  6.5 3,887  598.00 \n2  Virginia Beach  21 12,338  587.52 \n20  Leesburg  8 4,689  586.13 \n3  Portsmouth  14 7,643  545.93 \n21  Martinsville  5 2,646  529.20 \n22  Danville  4 2,097  524.25 \n11  Petersburg  6 3,118  519.67 \n23  Roanoke  10 5,153  515.30 \n27  Pulaski  5 2,573  514.60 \n15  Fredericksburg  12 6,165  513.75 \n19  Fairfax  20.5 10,251  500.05 \n24  Bedford/Lynchburg 10.5 4,997  475.90 \n13  Richmond  25 11,892  475.68 \n16  Charlottesville  7 3,161  451.57 \n5  Franklin/Suffolk  10 3,771  377.10 \n18  Alexandria  9 3,326  369.56 \n10  Halifax  6 2,185  364.17 \nTotals     186 94,271  506.83 \n* The Norfolk Public Defender Office, which has 19 attorneys (including the \nPublic Defender), was not included in this chart because the office did not open \nuntil Fall 2002 and therefore caseload data for it is not available. \n \n \n  An assistant public defender in Winchester, where attorneys handled an average of 674 \ncases apiece in FY 2002, said that with this kind of caseload, it is “impossible to focus on the \ncases that are coming up.”  One attorney had closed 372 cases for the first six months of 2003.  \nJail visits, we were told, were reserved for only the most serious cases.  The office investigator \nspends much of his time doing intake and conducting client interviews.  He is often the only \nperson from the public defender’s office who has seen a client before the client’s first court \nappearance with his public defender.  \n \n  A public defender in Fairfax said that the caseload is so high (160-170 open cases per \nattorney) that “it verges on malpractice.”  “When attorneys have to ask the court for a \ncontinuance because there is no time to work on a case, then that is the breaking point. And that \nhappens all the time.”  Another attorney in the office said that because of the caseloads, “we let \n  28\n\nthings slide.  We cannot help it.  We don’t have time for investigation or research.” \nInvestigation, one public defender said, is limited to talking to the client and hoping that he or \nshe is giving the right picture.   \n \n  A newer public defender in Fairfax who was worried that her workload was preventing \nher from complying with the Public Defender Commission’s rule to meet with incarcerated \nclients within 48 hours of appointment was told by a more senior attorney to “just ignore it.”  \nAnother new attorney said she had a bench trial coming up very soon and yet she has “no idea” \nhow to conduct direct and cross examination.  She said she felt uneasy that she had abandoned \nall of the “best practices” she was taught in her law school clinic, including talking to police \nofficers, visiting the crime scene, running checks on records, requesting release of medical \nrecords, filing motions, investigating, calling employers, churches and community groups, \ngetting 911 tapes and talking to witnesses.  She said the only thing she does now is talk to the \nclient outside the courtroom. \n \n  In June 2003, the Norfolk chief public defender circulated an anonymous survey to all \nattorneys asking them to describe their caseloads as “light, medium, heavy or overwhelming.” \nAmong those who responded, 90 percent said that their caseloads were either “heavy” or \n“overwhelming.”  Other questions queried how common it was to work evenings and/or \nweekends, whether attorneys felt they had too many cases to effectively and competently \nrepresent their clients, and, if they were struggling, what did they feel was the solution (“I need \nhelp getting organized and handling my cases more efficiently;” “cases need to be distributed \nmore evenly;” or, “we have too many cases as a team and we need to ask the court for relief”).  \nThe Norfolk office ultimately requested and received relief: the courts agreed to stop making \nassignments to public defenders on Fridays. All new appointments go to private, court-appointed \ncounsel on Fridays.   \n \n  The decision to stop appointing cases to public defenders on Fridays provided some \ntemporary relief. However, by the time we visited in August, attorneys were again under serious \ncase pressure.  A public defender told us she had a misdemeanor trial set for the afternoon of our \nvisit.  The client was out-of-custody and the public defender had not met him; there had been no \ntime to schedule an interview.  Because of a prosecutorial charging error, she knew the case \ncould be won if the client showed up in court.  The public defender said “this happens a lot” in \nmisdemeanor cases; client interviews are not always set up due to overwhelming caseloads.  A \njuvenile defender who estimated she had, on average, 100 open cases, said public defenders  \nhave to struggle to get to the jail or the detention center; she felt it was harder for them than it is \nfor assigned counsel.  “We have no time for legal research, calling families, filing motions.”  \n“Normally I began preparing for cases one day before the court appearance,” by looking at the \nfile, checking on whether she met with the client, reviewing the facts, etc. \n \n  The only national source that has attempted to quantify a maximum annual public defender \ncaseload is the National Advisory Commission (NAC), which published its standards in 1973.  In that \nreport, standard 13.12 on courts states: \n \n  29\n\nThe caseload of a public defender attorney should not exceed the following: \nfelonies per attorney per year: not more than 150; misdemeanors (excluding \ntraffic) per attorney per year: not more than 400; juvenile court cases per attorney \nper year: not more than 200; Mental Health Act cases per attorney per year: not \nmore than 200; and appeals per attorney per year: not more than 25.86 \n \n  A number of states and counties have developed public defender caseload standards that are \nsimilar to the NAC standards but are specifically tailored to their jurisdiction’s practice.  The \nSpangenberg Group has conducted studies to develop weighted caseload standards for public defender \nand contract attorney programs in five states and three counties.87  The following table includes caseload \nstandards from 14 states and one city.  The standards address the maximum number of cases that a full-\ntime lawyer should handle in a 12-month period. In addition, the standards are disjunctive, thus, if a \npublic defender is assigned cases from more than one category, the percentage of the maximum caseload \nfor each category should be assessed and the combined total should not exceed 100 percent.   In order to \nbe reasonable, accordingly, at any one point in the year, a public defender’s open caseload must include \nfar fewer cases than the annual numbers set out in the standards.\n                                                 \n86 National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Report of the Task Force on Courts at \n186 (Washington, D.C. 1973). \n87 The case-weighting model employed by TSG requires public defenders or contract attorneys to keep detailed time records \nof their work over a given period of time, typically ranging from ten to thirteen weeks, on specially designed time sheets.  \nThe time records provide a means by which caseload (the number of cases handled) can be translated into workload (the \namount of effort, measured in units of time, for the lawyer to complete work on the caseload).  The ability to weight cases \nallows thorough consideration of not just the raw number of cases assigned to a criminal justice agency annually, but also the \nseverity of various case types handled by the program.  In the broadest context, weights can be given to the total annual \ncaseload of a defender organization to compare to the next year’s anticipated volume of cases.  Assuming that accurate \nrecords are kept of attorney time expended in each case during the study period, the development of workload standards and \nthe determination of staffing needs for the projected caseload can be accomplished with some assurance of precision. \n  30\n\n \nTable 5-2 \nPublic Defender Workload Standards \n \nState  Felony  Misdemeanor  Juvenile  Appeals  Author/Authority\nArizona  150  300  200  25  State of Arizona v.

For Felony A and B cases, \nthe public defender caseload standard is 40 cases per year.  For Felony C and D cases, the public defender caseload \nstandard is 180. \n91 The Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy has established a felony caseload standard for only the most \nserious category of felonies.  The standard represents the number of violent crime cases (rape, manslaughter, 2nd \ndegree murder, sexual assault) that a single attorney could handle during a year if those cases were the only case she \nhandled during the year. \n  31\n\nWashington Defender Association.  “Standards for Public \nWashington  150  300  250  25  Defender Services: Objectives and minimum Requirements \nfor Providing Legal Representation to Poor Persons Accused \n \nof Crime in Washington State.”  October 1989.\nWisconsin*  145  323  207  --  The Spangenberg Group.  “Caseload/Workload Study fo r the \nState Public Defender of Wisconsin.”  September 1990.\n \n* = Jurisdictions where caseload standards were developed through case-weighting studies.\n \n \n  Interviews with dedicated but hopelessly overburdened public defenders in Virginia made \nit clear that caseload pressures were leaving potential legal issues unlitigated.  Many \nCommonwealth’s attorneys and judges also commented that public defender workloads were \nexcessive. The following quotes from assistant public defenders throughout the state sum up the \npressures on these attorneys: “I feel as though they ask me to handle these cases but then won’t \ngive me the tools I need to do my job.” “I’m in court all the time.  Clients get sick of hearing that \nI am unavailable to speak with them because I am in court.”  “We provide assembly-line justice.” \n“If I had less cases, I could do more investigation.” \n \n  Consequences of case overload include:  lack of client and family member contact, \ninability to do legal research, little or no motion practice, insufficient investigation in cases \nwhere investigators are not used, insufficient case and trial preparation, failure to prepare a pre-\nsentence plan and, eventually, burnout.  All of these factors affect an attorney’s ability to \neffectively litigate the case, whether going to trial or negotiating a plea bargain.   \n \n  Although most public defenders we met work hard, they labor under a public perception \nthat public defenders are not “real attorneys;” a sentiment that is common (and frequently \nincorrect) around the country.  However, the perception that public defenders are not “real \nattorneys” is difficult to dispel when overburdened attorneys arrive at court with a stack of files \nand can’t recall client names. One juvenile public defender said she shows up at court and \nrecognizes faces but can’t remember names, “Clients get offended. That’s difficult to deal with.”  \n \n  Working under such conditions on a day to day basis can affect morale.  Morale was low \nin some offices visited. Most public defender attorneys believe that conditions are unlikely to \nimprove in the future. \n \nTraining and Supervision \n \n  A major weakness of the public defense system in Virginia is that there is little initial \ntraining provided to new attorneys.  Unlike many other public defender systems, Virginia has no \nformal introductory training program for brand new public defenders.  It is up to individual \noffices to provide initial training and the offices tend to be too busy with pending caseloads to do \nmuch.  Supervisors carry full caseloads; many supervisors carry more cases than less \nexperienced attorneys, thus there is little or no time for actual supervision of less experienced \nattorneys.  A senior assistant public defender in charge of training in Fairfax was forthright when \nshe said, “I don’t do any training.  I carry my own caseload of misdemeanors, which sometimes \namounts to 300 open cases.”   \n \n  32\n\n  The experience of attorneys working with the new Norfolk Public Defender office (which \nopened in 2002) was telling.  The first division to become operational was the juvenile court \ndivision, which has five attorneys and started accepting cases in October 2002.  The attorneys \nwho were hired did not have any juvenile court experience.  They spent the month of September \ngoing to a PDC training session in Richmond, doing court observation in Norfolk, and reading \nup on juvenile practice.  There was no formal training, and one told us they were all \noverwhelmed when they began. \n \n  A public defender in Fredericksburg joined the office with some but not much criminal \ncase experience.  When he started, he was given a criminal law and motor vehicle handbook.  \nWithin his first week he had 20 cases and was trying a bench trial. He said he would have \npreferred to receive initial training, and even now that he has more experience, he felt it would \nbe helpful to have someone who could give pointers.    \n \n  The Public Defender Commission sponsors several statewide, annual training programs.  \nThe programs are valuable, but are no replacement for initial training of new attorneys.  There is \nan annual public defender conference that includes a half-day management meeting for chief \npublic defenders and commission members and a full day (6 hours) of CLE for all public \ndefender lawyers.  The training is mandatory, although exceptions are made for unavoidable \ncourt conflicts. The 2002 conference was cancelled due to the state's budget crises.  Other than \nthat, it has been held every year since 1988. \n \n  The Commission also sponsors a yearly combined training for investigators and \nsentencing advocates. Due to a lack of funds, this conference was cancelled in 2001 and 2002, \nbut was held in 2003.  In addition, the PDC co-sponsors a yearly Juvenile Law & Education \nConference with the University of Richmond School of Law.  The training lasts one day, and is \nopen to public defenders as well as the private bar.  The PDC also helps organize and staff an \nannual Capital Defense Workshop, which is officially sponsored by the Virginia Bar \nAssociation.  The workshop is a day and a half and is also open to public defenders and the \nprivate bar.  Finally, the PDC holds a yearly management conference for all Public Defender-\nManagers (the head of each office) and commission members. \n \n  The Public Defender Commission’s Appellate Public Defender Office (APD) in \nRichmond has a staff of three attorneys and one secretary.  There is no paralegal or law intern to \nhelp with legal research.  The intent in creating the office was to allow it to do appeals from \npublic defender offices that could not handle them, either because they were very small, rural \noffices or were urban offices that have a large number of appeals.  Local public defender offices \ncan opt to handle their own appeals or send them to the APD.  The Richmond, Alexandria, \nVirginia Beach and Fairfax offices do their own appeals.  Many other state public defender \nsystems have created statewide appellate offices to handle all appeals in order for appellate \ncounsel to take as objective an eye as possible of the trial record, something that may entail \nraising a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  In Virginia, unlike most other states, a \nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not permitted in the direct appeal.  It may only be \nraised in state habeas, or post-conviction, proceedings.  Virginia has no right to counsel in non-\ncapital state habeas proceedings, and the Appellate Public Defender does not handle them.    \n  33\n\n \n  Appellate defenders carry a high caseload: seven months into 2003 the APD attorneys \nhad opened 157 cases. At the Richmond public defender office, two attorneys were pulled out of \ntrial rotation to create an appellate “unit.”  The two attorneys both file 50 briefs apiece per year.  \nThey also prepare case summaries and hold monthly training sessions for staff in the office.  \nRichmond is the only trial office with a designated appellate unit.  \n \n  A striking gap in the Virginia public defender system is its absence of a mechanism to \npursue systemic claims of deficiencies in the state’s criminal justice system.  Other states with \npublic defender programs often rely on appellate offices or special litigation units to raise test \ncase litigation and class action claims on behalf of their clients.  \n \nDisparity in Resources Between Commonwealth’s Attorneys and Public Defenders \n \n  Although they are both state-created and funded positions, and although both work on the \nsame cases, Commonwealth’s attorneys and public defenders are not paid on par with one \nanother.  Across the board, from entry level to the most senior positions, attorneys working as \nCommonwealth’s attorneys earn more - sometimes significantly more - than public defenders in \nlike jobs.  One private attorney panel member we interviewed in Richmond wanted to work as a \npublic defender as soon as he graduated from law school. However, with student loans and a new \nfamily, the Commonwealth attorney’s office’s starting salary offer of $8,000 more than the \npublic defender office could pay was impossible to refuse.  He stayed with the Commonwealth’s \nattorney’s office for four years before starting a private defense practice.   \n \n  In Lynchburg, salary disparities between Commonwealth’s attorneys and public \ndefenders ranged from $1,000 for entry-level pay to $27,000 at the top level.  In Virginia Beach, \nthere is a $15,000 disparity in starting pay for assistant Commonwealth’s attorneys and assistant \npublic defenders.  Further, there are 57 assistant commonwealth attorneys, compared to 34 \nassistant public defenders.  In Norfolk, there is a $6,837 difference in starting pay between \nassistant public defenders and assistant Commonwealth’s attorneys and a $42,000 difference in \npay for the chief public defender and the elected Commonwealth’s Attorney.  Average pay in the \noffices is $64,000 for assistant Commonwealth’s attorneys and $46,000 for assistant public \ndefenders.   \n \n  The salaries for elected Commonwealth’s Attorneys are established by the General \nAssembly and vary according to population of the locality served. Salaries listed in the following \ntable are the minimum amounts that must be paid.  The salaries listed may not be the actual \nsalary of a specific Commonwealth’s Attorney, as many local governments have authorized a \nsalary supplement, paid from local funds, for the elected Commonwealth’s Attorney, as well as \nfor other staff in the offices. \n \n \n \n  34\n\nMinimum Commonwealth’s Attorney Salaries July 1, 2002 to June 30, 200392 \n \nPopulation  Minimum Salary \nLess than 10,000  $43,478 \n10,000 -19,999  $48,315 \n20,000 - 34,999  $53,145 \n35,000 - 44,999  $95,659 \n45,000 - 99,999  $106,286 \n100,000 - 249,999  $110,271 \n250,000 and above  $114,260 \n \n \n  Many Commonwealth’s attorney offices receive supplemental funds from local \ngovernments for purposes other than supplementing salaries.  For example, we were told the City \nof Richmond provides approximately $400,000 to the Richmond Commonwealth’s attorney’s \noffice to use as it pleases.  In addition to these direct contributions, Commonwealth’s attorneys \nhave access to critical case preparation resources that fall outside of their budgets, including \naccess to local, state and federal law enforcement personnel, state and federal crime labs and \nstate psychiatric personnel.   \n \n  Some assistant commonwealth’s attorneys’ positions are entirely funded by grants and/or \nlocalities.  In Fairfax, the average salary of assistant Commonwealth’s attorneys is $13,000 more \nthan that paid to assistant public defenders.  The disparity is due in large part to local \nsupplements paid to the prosecution.  No local supplements are made for the Fairfax public \ndefender office.  In Norfolk, the City provides fringe benefits and free parking for all \nCommonwealth’s attorney personnel.  The Public Defender sought supplemental funding but \nwas denied.   \n \n  We were told that just two public defender offices in the state receive local support. The \nAlexandria public defender office receives office space, phone service and computer hardware \nand support from the city.  The City of Richmond provides office space for six public defender \nattorneys working in the Juvenile & Domestic Relations Court.  No public defender office \nreceives money to supplement salaries or to hire support staff, paralegals or additional attorneys.  \nAccording to the State Compensation Board, 56 of 120 Commonwealth’s attorney’s offices \nreported receiving supplemental local funds to boost staff salaries in FY 2004, totaling \n$7,484,391.93  Many Commonwealth’s attorneys also receive office space, parking facilities, and \nother in-kind services that the Compensation Board does not track and that would not appear on \nany Commonwealth’s attorney’s budget.  For example, the Norfolk Commonwealth’s attorney \nhas three police officers assigned to it as full-time investigators.  That is in addition to the \n$724,731 it received from the City of Norfolk in salary supplements for staff in FY 2004, almost \nhalf of the entire budget for the Norfolk public defender office.  \n                                                 \n92 Compensation Board, Commonwealth of Virginia, Constitutional Officers Budges and Salaries: Commonwealth’s \nAttorneys, (2002) at http://scb.state.va.us/salary1.html#commatty. \n93 The Compensation Board has no way of validating the accuracy of the figures reported, or ensuring that all \ncommonwealth attorney offices that receive salary supplements report on them.  \n  35\n\n \n  Low salaries clearly make it difficult for public defender offices in Virginia to recruit and \nretain experienced attorneys. When an attorney position opened up at the Winchester public \ndefender office, only one resume was received in response to the job posting. The chief public \ndefender in Richmond explained that whenever he has an attorney vacancy, he starts the new hire \nat the entry level pay of $38,163, even if they are very experienced.  Due to the low pay, he feels \nit is important to promote from within.   \n \nIt is not the purpose of this study to review the appropriate staffing and resources, both \nmonetary and in-kind, of Commonwealth’s attorneys’ offices.  We provide comparative \ninformation solely to show the enormous disparity between prosecutors and public defenders in \nVirginia.  The American Bar Association suggests that the appropriate measure of health within \na criminal justice is whether each agency in the system - courts, prosecution, defender - receives \nadequate and balanced resources.  Applying this goal, Virginia’s criminal justice system, and the \npublic defense function in particular, fall far behind what is adequate and balanced. \n \nInadequate Support Staff  \n   \n  All public defender offices have investigators and secretaries on staff, however the \nnumber of support positions is very few compared to those in Commonwealth’s attorney offices.  \nFor example, the Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office has 37 attorneys and 35 support \nstaff compared to the Public Defender Office’s 20 attorneys and 10 support staff.  Public \ndefender investigators (which are discussed in greater detail below) are required to prioritize \ntheir work, helping attorneys with the most serious cases.   Secretaries are often unable to assist \nattorneys with even basic correspondence, such as sending out letters to clients, as they are fully \noccupied keeping up with filing, receptionist, scheduling, and other administrative duties. There \nare no paralegals, but eight of the public defender offices have a sentencing advocate.  \nSentencing advocates perform mitigation, which entails, among other things, compiling critical \nsocial history background information on clients and serving as a liaison with mental health \nprofessionals to assist attorneys in sentencing. \n \n  The Indiana Public Defender Commission’s94 workload standards listed in Table 5-3 were \ndesigned for use by indigent defense practitioners who have access to adequate support staff, in \nrecognition of the important role support staff play in providing quality indigent defense. The Indiana \n  \nworkload standards in Table 5-2 represent the caseload standards for offices that maintain an adequate \nlevel of support staff consistent with the guidelines set-out in Table 5-3 below.  County public defender \n                                                 \n94 Indiana's 92 counties have the primary responsibility for funding the indigent defense programs within their \njurisdictions.  Each county may choose between a county public defender, contract defender program or an assigned \ncounsel system.  The Indiana Public Defender Commission (IPDC) allocates state funds to offset county indigent \ndefense expenditures in those counties that comply with the commission's standards for indigent defense services in \ncapital and non-capital cases.  Counties that enforce these standards are reimbursed by the IPDC for 40% of the cost \nof representing indigent defendants in non-capital felony cases and 50% of the cost of attorneys’ fees, as well as \nexpert, investigative and support services, in capital cases.  Currently, 54 of Indiana’s 92 counties comply with \nIPDC standards and receive funds from the Commission. \n  36\n\noffices that do not maintain the required support staff to attorney ratios are held to more stringent annual \ncaseload standards (100-150 felonies; 300 misdemeanors; 200 juvenile cases; and, 20 appeals).   \n \n  Table 5-3 \nIndiana Public Defender Commission’s \n Adequate Support Staff Guidelines \nSupport Staff Position  Ratio of Support Staff to Attorneys \nParalegal - Felony  1:4 \nParalegal - Misdemeanor  1:5 \nParalegal - Juvenile  1:4 \nParalegal - Mental Health  1:2 \nInvestigator - Felony  1:4 \nInvestigator - Misdemeanor  1:6 \nInvestigator - Juvenile  1:6 \nLaw Clerk - Appeal  1:2 \nSecretary - Felony  1:4 \nSecretary - Misdemeanor  1:6 \nSecretary - Juvenile  1:5 \n \n \n  Like any places of employment, Virginia’s public defender offices experience periodic \nturnover and vacancies.  However, since the offices operate close to the bone even when fully \nstaffed, vacancies exert a serious hardship on the offices.95    \n \nOther Important Resources \n \n  Besides a shortage of staffing to effectively handle the workload, Virginia’s public \ndefender offices lack the most basic equipment necessary to run a modern law office.  \nInvestigators, in particular, lack the tools necessary to conduct and document investigations and \nprepare for presentations in court.  Further, public defender offices receive no funds for basic \nlitigation expenses, such as having photocopies made of crime records. \n \n  The resources of the Richmond Public Defender’s office typify those of other offices. \nThe office uses Windows 95, has old computers and very slow internet access.  Until recently, \nthe office had just two printers for the entire office, which spans the floor of a downtown office \nbuilding.  Now the office has three printers. There is no IT person on staff; the Public Defender \nCommission has two IT staff members for the 21 public defender offices.  When they get “new” \nequipment, it is typically left-over castoffs the Public Defender Commission has accumulated: a \n“new computer” can be four years old.  Unlike the Commonwealth Attorney’s office, the Public \n                                                 \n95 As of June, 2003, the Public Defender Commission reported the following vacancies statewide: 1 Deputy PD, 1 \nSenior Assistant PD, 5 Assistant PD-Is, 1 Assistant PD-II, 1 Investigator, 1 Sentencing Advocate, 1 Secretary. \n  37\n\nDefender staff lacks the capacity to view digital photos from the Medical Examiner’s office.  In \nan age where digital photographic equipment is the standard, the office has two Polaroid cameras \nand an old video camera. They have no access to any criminal history information of their \nclients.  Investigators are not provided with state cars (but are reimbursed for mileage): one \ninvestigator had put 200,000 miles on her car in four years. The Richmond Circuit Court has \ndigital projection machines permitting PowerPoint and accident reconstruction presentations.  \nThe public defender office has no laptops so it can’t make use of the circuit court equipment. \nThis places the public defender office at a disadvantage; it can’t keep up with the \nCommonwealth’s attorney’s office’s technology.   Most public defender offices have very \nlimited access to the internet; usually just one or two computers in the office are equipped with \naccess.   \n \n  In Halifax, the public defender office has one computer with internet access (the \ninvestigator’s), the printers are broken, there are not enough phone lines and there is no free fax \nline.  One attorney explained, “we are stunted when it comes to [legal and general] research,” \nand “there is not a piece of machinery here that should be kept.” Others told us operating without \ne-mail is a huge hindrance, and phone calls made from personal cell phones are not reimbursed, \nwhich impacts attorneys who are frequently on the road going to different courts.  One attorney \nsaid that she pays for her own training.  When she has an appeal, she travels to Richmond and \nhas to pay for a hotel with her own money (because Richmond is less than 3 hours away). “The \nCommonwealth has everything.  We are the bastard child of the criminal justice system.”  \n \n  The Public Defender Commission reported that there are only 26 full-time investigators \nfor 216 staff attorneys statewide, a ratio of 1 investigator for 8.5 attorneys.  Staffing in individual \noffices includes, Richmond: two investigators for 25 attorneys, Virginia Beach: two investigators \nfor 21 attorneys, Fairfax: two investigators for 22 attorneys, and Norfolk: two investigators for \n20 full-time attorneys.  The investigators are reserved for only the most serious cases, thus the \nvast majority of cases receive no investigative work.  \n   \n  By statute, the localities have to provide Commonwealth’s attorneys with office space.  \nPublic defenders must pay for rent. There has not been any new money for rent increases for \npublic defender offices for 10 years, so securing and maintaining inexpensive office space that is \nnear the courts is challenging for most offices.  \n \nDiscretion to Prosecute Misdemeanors  \n \n  Commonwealth’s attorneys in Virginia are required to prosecute felonies while \nprosecution of misdemeanors is discretionary.  Typically the decision to prosecute misdemeanors \nis based on budget and personnel, an option public defenders do not have.  Unless local judges \nagree to reduce assignments due to case overload, public defenders do not get to pick and choose \nthe types of cases they will handle.  In rural areas, Commonwealth’s attorneys tend to prosecute \nmore misdemeanors than in urban or high volume crime areas.  If a misdemeanor is appealed to \nCircuit Court, the Commonwealth’s attorney is required to represent the Commonwealth.   \n   \n  38\n\n  In Norfolk, we were told, the Commonwealth’s Attorney has decided for public policy \nand political reasons to prosecute certain misdemeanors.  Approximately six years ago, when the \noffice received federal grant funding, it began prosecuting domestic violence cases in J&DR \ncourt.  Also, within the last few years, the office began prosecuting misdemeanors committed in \nhigh crime areas as part of a community enforcement project.  In those cases where the \nCommonwealth’s attorney is not involved, whoever initiated the charge - either the complaining \nwitness or the arresting officer - must present evidence.  In localities with public defender \noffices, a Commonwealth’s attorney’s decision to not prosecute misdemeanors creates an even \ngreater disparity in resources between the two offices.  \n  39\n\nCHAPTER 6 \nINDIGENT DEFENSE IN VIRGINIA: ASSIGNED COUNSEL \n  Like public defenders, court-appointed counsel in Virginia suffer from a lack of adequate \nresources.  Our nine-month investigation revealed that Virginia has the lowest unwaiveable fee \ncaps in the nation.  As a result of these low caps, assigned counsel have little incentive to devote \nthe necessary time and effort to properly represent indigent defendants, as they will not be \ncompensated for such work.  Rather, most cases are processed quickly through the system with \nlittle or no investigation, research or preparation.  \n \n  The previous chapter set out many of the weaknesses of the public defender system in \nVirginia, most of them related to inadequate resources but some due to or exacerbated by poor \nleadership by the Public Defender Commission.  Assigned counsel in Virginia face their own set \nof problems.  As with public defenders, most of these problems relate to inadequate resources, \nbut inadequate oversight is also a factor.  \n \nStandards and Guidelines  \n \n  There are no statewide, minimum experience, training or performance requirements for \nattorneys to be permitted to accept non-capital adult criminal and juvenile delinquency cases in \nVirginia. The sole statewide requirement for attorneys to accept court-appointments is that they \nvolunteer for the panel and be members in good standing with the Virginia State Bar.   \n \n  In addition to the national standards and guidelines discussed previously, a number of \nstates and localities have developed standards and guidelines for assigned counsel programs.  In \n2000, the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance published its Compendium of \nStandards for Indigent Defense Systems, which includes a collection of national, state and local \nstandards governing Administration of Defense Systems, Attorney Performance, Capital Case \nRepresentation, Appellate Representation, and Juvenile Justice Defense.96  The Compendium is \nnot exhaustive; a number of states and counties that have developed standards are not included in \nthe document, but it is a useful starting point for comparison purposes.   \n \nProcess of Getting on the Panels \n \n  The process for getting on court-appointed panels is typically informal: attorneys tell \ncourt clerks they would like to be on the panel, or ask a judge for permission.  However, a few  \nof the jurisdictions we visited imposed additional requirements to be eligible for court \nappointments.  In Fairfax, attorneys must watch a video about the responsibilities of being a \ncourt-appointed lawyer, meet with the director of the court services program, and fill out basic \npaperwork.  All attorneys, no matter how experienced, are initially only appointed to \nmisdemeanor and traffic cases.  To be able to accept appointments in felony cases, they must \n                                                 \n96 See U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Compendium of Standards for Indigent Defense Systems, \n(Dec. 200), available at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/indigentdefense/compendium/pdftxt/vol3.pdf.  The Compendium \nis intended to be useful for persons dealing with funding sources; for agencies or organizations that are developing \ncriminal defense standards; and for academics and courts that need a reference point. \n  40\n\nsend a written request to the director, who circulates it among the general district and circuit \ncourt judges.  If a single judge provides any negative feedback, the attorney will not be certified \nfor felony cases.   \n \n  In nearby Prince William County, attorneys must join the local bar to be on the court-\nappointed list. To join the bar, two members must write letters on your behalf.  Attorneys who do \nnot have a Prince William address can only get appointments to detained clients and out-of-\ncustody clients whose home address is not in Prince William County. If you have a Prince \nWilliam County address you can get non-jail Prince William County resident clients.  In rural \nRussell County, all new attorneys are expected to take cases because the area has few new \nattorneys.  \n \n  We did not come across any panels requiring even minimal training or CLE \nrequirements.  In Montgomery County, where private attorneys provide representation in all \nindigent cases, a group of lawyers from the criminal bar got together in 2002 and proposed \nrecommendations for judges regarding requirements for court-appointed attorneys.  The \nrecommended requirements included that attorneys:  complete at least 6 CLE requirements in \ncriminal law every other year; contact an incarcerated client within four days of receiving notice \nof appointment; have at least one year of criminal law experience before being appointed on a \ncharge carrying a sentence of 20 years or more; and seek co-counsel for a first felony jury trial.  \nThe local bar twice refused to put the proposal to a vote. \n \n  Because there are no minimum experience qualifications in most Virginia jurisdictions, \nattorneys can get appointed to felonies immediately upon passing the bar, although rarely are \nthey appointed to the most serious or violent felonies.  One newer attorney practicing in \nTazewell County said that other than not getting a complicated rape or homicide case, they can \nget whatever comes in.  In Tazewell County, attorneys reported that, as a “rite of passage,” the \nyoungest attorney in town gets all the child molester cases.  One new attorney in Buchanan \nCounty was appointed to a distribution case before he was even sworn in to the Bar; the client \nwas facing 120 years imprisonment.  \n \nExceptions: Guardians ad Litem and Counsel in Capital Cases  \n \n  In contrast to non-capital criminal cases, attorneys who wish to receive appointments as \nGALs are subject to standards governing appointment and performance.  Since 1995, attorneys \nhave been subject to Standards to Govern the Appointment of Guardians Ad Litem, promulgated \npursuant to sec. 16.1-266 of the Code of Virginia.  The goal of the standards “is to foster \nvigorous, effective and competent representation of children’s interest and welfare.” The \nstandards were developed by the Judicial Council of Virginia in conjunction with the Virginia \nState Bar and the Virginia Bar Association and require seven hours initial training and six years \ncontinuing education biennially on topics related to representation of children as a GAL. In \naddition, attorneys must demonstrate that they have previous experience in juvenile and domestic \nrelations court cases involving children and get a certificate demonstrating proficiency in such \nwork from a judge before whom they have appeared or from an attorney already qualified as a \nGAL who the applicant has assisted.   \n  41\n\n \n  As of September 1, 2003, GALs are also subject to Standards to Govern the Performance \nof Guardians Ad Litem for Children. Among other things, the standards require the GALs to \nmeet face-to-face and interview their child clients (it is recognized that in-person meetings with \ninfants and children who are pre-verbal will rely primarily on observation of the child’s \nsurroundings and interactions with the child’s caretaker), conduct an independent investigation \nof the case and provide the court with sufficient information including specific recommendations \nfor court action based upon the findings of interviews and investigation. \n  \n  Unlike non-capital criminal cases, attorneys who wish to represent indigent defendants \nfacing a sentence of death must meet minimal experience standards.  Pursuant to §19.2-163.8(E) \nof the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, the Supreme Court and Public Defender \nCommission, in conjunction with the Virginia State Bar, set forth standards required for \nappointment of counsel in capital cases. The Virginia Code strongly urges but does not mandate \nthat circuit courts appoint two attorneys for trial, appellate, and habeas proceedings. \nAccordingly, standards are set out for both \"lead counsel\" and for \"co-counsel.\" If a public \ndefender is appointed (from one of the four capital defender offices or from one of the 20 trial \noffices) and is either \"lead\" or \"co-counsel\", the other attorney should be appointed from the \nprivate bar.  All have to meet the standards. 97 \n                                                 \n97 TRIAL COUNSEL: \nLead Counsel must: \na. Be an active member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar or admitted to practice pro hac vice;  \nb. Have at least five years of criminal litigation practice (defense or prosecution) within the past seven years \nincluding experience as defense counsel in at least five jury trials, tried to verdict, involving violent crimes with \nmaximum penalties of at least 20 years or more.  \nc. Have had, within the past two years, at least six hours of specialized training in capital litigation, plus at least four \nhours of specialized training required by §19.2-163.8(A)(vii) of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended;  \nd. Have had at least one of the following:  \nexperience as \"lead counsel\" in the defense of at least one capital case within the past five years (FOR THE \nPURPOSE OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH, WHENEVER THE TERM \"CAPITAL CASE\" IS USED, IT SHALL \nMEAN A CASE IN WHICH THE DEATH PENALTY WAS SOUGHT AND WHICH WAS CONCLUDED \nAFTER THE JURY WAS IMPANELED), or experience as co-counsel in the defense of at least two capital cases \nwithin the past seven years; \ne. Be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate court systems, including specifically the procedural rules regarding \ntimeliness of filings and procedural default; \nf. Have demonstrated proficiency and commitment to quality representation.  \nCo-counsel must meet all of the requirements of \"lead counsel\" except A.1(d). \n \nAPPELLATE COUNSEL:  \nAppellate counsel must meet the following requirements: \n1. Be an active member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar or admitted to practice pro hac vice.  \n2. Have, within the past five years, briefed and argued the merits, after writs have been granted, in:  \na. At least three felony cases in an appellate court; or \nb. The appeal of a case in which the death penalty was imposed by the trial court.  \n3. Have had, within the past two years, at least six hours of specialized training in capital litigation, plus at least four \nhours of specialized training required by §19.2-163.8(A)(vii) of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.  \n4. Be thoroughly familiar with the rules and procedures of appellate practice. \n \nHABEAS CORPUS COUNSEL: \nHabeas Corpus counsel must satisfy one of the following requirements: \n  42\n\n \n  The Administrative Office of the Courts monitors GAL qualifications to ensure that those \nattorneys who qualify as GALs have the requisite training, but it does not have the capacity to \nmonitor performance.  Likewise, the Public Defender Commission monitors CLE compliance \nbut not performance for capital case counsel. \n  \nAppointment System \n \n  The Virginia Code provides that court-appointed counsel must be selected by a fair \nsystem of rotation among bar members who volunteer to take these cases and whose practice \nbefore the court regularly includes representation of persons in criminal cases.98  Contrary to \nrecommendations of national standards, in most Virginia circuits, appointment of assigned \ncounsel in indigent defendant and juvenile cases is done in an ad hoc fashion. One of the primary \ncriticisms of ad hoc systems is that they fail to appoint counsel in a systematic fashion that \nensures equitable distribution of cases among qualified attorneys.99  Indeed, our site work and \nreview of data from the AOC’s office confirmed that appointments are not consistently made in \nan equitable fashion throughout Virginia. \n \n  Data obtained from the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of \nVirginia for FY 2002 shows that there were 215,640 private bar court appointments at a total \ncost of $56,243,295.04 statewide.  There were 2,931 private attorneys appointed to the 215,640 \ncases.   \n \n  A summary of the data shows that 352 attorneys, or only 12 percent of the 2,931 \nattorneys accepting appointed cases, were appointed to 100,963 cases, or 47 percent of the cases \nstatewide.  These 352 attorneys accounted for $28,652,464.43, or 51 percent of the total dollars \npaid to court-appointed counsel in 2002.  The average earnings among the 352 attorneys was \n$81,456, and the average payment per case was $283.99. \n \n  In contrast, this same data shows that 1,363 or 47 percent of the total 2,931 court-\nappointed lawyers receiving cases in 2002 handled only 8,463 of the cases, or 4 percent of the \n                                                                                                                                                             \na. Possess experience as counsel of record in Virginia or federal post conviction proceedings involving attacks on \nthe validity of one or more felony convictions, as well as a working knowledge of state and federal habeas corpus \npractice through specialized training in the representation of persons with death sentences, including the training \nrequired by §19.2.163.8(A)(vii) of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended;  \nb. Have served as counsel in at least one capital habeas corpus proceeding in Virginia and/or federal courts during \nthe past three years; or \nc. Have at least seven years civil trial and appellate litigation experience in the Courts of Record of the \nCommonwealth and/or federal courts. \n98 VA. CODE ANN. § 19.2-159. \n99 Commentary to Standard 5-2.1 of the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services reads:  \nAt its worst, the ad hoc system for assigning counsel is typified by the practice of \nappointing lawyers only because they happen to be present in the courtroom at the time a \ndefendant is brought before the judge.  This method of assignment obviously is unlikely \nto achieve an equitable distribution of assignments among the qualified members of the \nbar, and in some jurisdictions the practice has given rise to a cadre of mediocre lawyers \nwho wait in the courtroom in hopes of receiving an appointment.  \n  43\n\ntotal 215,640 cases.  These lawyers received a total of $1,900,630.27, or an average of $1,394 \napiece.  The average payment per case was $224.58.  Almost half of the 1,363 attorneys (592, or \n22% of the 2,931 total attorneys) were appointed to fewer than five cases apiece in 2002. \n \n  Most indigent defendant criminal cases are appointed counsel by the general district \ncourts, where all misdemeanor and most felony cases (unless there is a direct indictment) are first \nheard, but there is a variety of ways in which appointments are managed.  Some courts, such as \nthe general district court in Tazewell County, appoint attorneys based on who is scheduled to be \nin court on the arraignment date, and the distribution of appointments among attorneys is not \ntracked.  In a couple of smaller counties, attorneys told us that lawyers perceived by judges as \nbeing overly zealous on behalf of their clients are no longer given appointments. \n  \n  Every judge we interviewed told us they feel that compensation for court-appointed \nlawyers is unreasonably low.  Attorneys and clerks in Newport News acknowledged that the \nsystem used to appoint counsel is designed to maximize a private attorney’s time and earnings on \ncourt-appointed cases by assigning multiple clients for court appearances set for the same day.  \nWhen an attorney’s name comes up on the district court clerk’s rotation, the clerk calls a couple \nof months in advance to schedule her for a three-week block of time during which she will be \navailable to spend three or four days each week doing court appearances.  After these block dates \nare set, attorneys get a monthly schedule saying what days they are scheduled for trials.  As the \nblocked dates approach, they start getting appointments for cases with court appearances \n(preliminary hearing or trial dates) set during the block of time scheduled for them.  The point of \nthis procedure is to allow attorneys to cluster a lot of court appearances on the same day.  One \nattorney told us, “You have to take multiple cases the same day, to earn adequate money.  It \nforces you to pile up cases.”   \n \n  If an attorney is meeting multiple clients at court for purposes of disposition or \npreliminary hearing, there is a high likelihood that the attorney is not spending adequate time on \neach case talking to and preparing clients and witnesses.  Even more worrisome is the fact that \nmany court-appointed attorneys reportedly only meet with their clients at court moments before \nthe court appearance.  The system of clustering cases, or maximizing attorney time with multiple \nappointments set for the same day, encourages lawyers to spend very little time on individual \ncases.  A premium is placed on quickly processing cases and moving as many as possible to \nguilty pleas on the same day.  Although intending to help accommodate lawyers who work in a \nflawed system, courts, through their appointment practices, are complicit in perpetuating the \nlowest level of representation possible. \n  \n  Several courts we visited have the clerks assign duty days to attorneys in advance, \nsometimes annually.  Attorneys normally get appointed to whatever cases come in on their duty \ndays.  Exceptions may be made for very serious cases where experienced practitioners are \nappointed out of rotation. In Norfolk, cases are docketed according to days that the arresting \nofficers’ have set aside to appear in court, thus attorneys will be appointed to cases if their \nschedules accommodate those of the officers.  \n \n  44\n\n  There is similar variety in the way appointments are made in J&DR court cases. In Prince \nWilliam County, the lawyers themselves instituted a rotating calendar schedule for covering \nJ&DR court cases. Several lawyers interviewed praised their “one day a month” system and \nhoped that it would be extended to the general district court.  In Richmond, we were told judges \nare “fast and loose with the lists.” Some judges give attorneys cases if they spot them in the \nhallways; likewise deputies go out and “round up” attorneys for appointments. \n \n  In circuit court, there is less structure to the way in which appointments are made. In a \nnumber of circuit courts visited, judges will assign cases from the bench. In the circuit court in \nNewport News, for example, cases on direct indictment are normally assigned to attorneys who \nare present in the courtroom at the time the assignment is needed.  Other circuit court judges will \nappoint attorneys they think can handle particular cases.   \n \n  We learned that in some counties, judges are not appointing counsel for parents in \ncustody and child support cases.  Although these are civil matters, parents can be detained up to \n12 months in jail in contempt of court, with no right to a jury trial, for failure to pay child \nsupport. One family law practitioner told us that child support issues vary from county to county: \nmost, but not all, counties do provide counsel. Caroline County does not appoint counsel in civil \nshow cause cases, including those where a parent is allegedly not paying child support. Parents \nin such cases are sentenced to the full 12 months in jail with no offer of counsel. A judge in \nHarrisonburg County says that he does not appoint attorneys for parents in custody and child \nsupport cases, even when there is a chance of jail time.  He said he relies on an unreported court \nof appeals case as dispositive in this area, but we were told there is an attorney general opinion \nsaying there is a right to counsel in these cases.   \n \n  Another related problem is that a parent cannot appeal a child support order if he or she \ncannot post the arrearage.  Poor individuals are unlikely to be able to come up with this, thus are \nnot able to appeal.  \n \nCompensation for Court-Appointed Attorneys \n \n  Both the General Assembly and the Supreme Court are involved in determining the \ncompensation scheme for court-appointed attorneys in Virginia.  Hourly compensation rates are \npromulgated by the Virginia Supreme Court while the General Assembly develops statutorily \nbinding per-case maximums. The hourly compensation rate approved for court-appointed \nattorneys in non-capital criminal cases and juvenile cases is $90, a rate that is higher than what is \npaid in most other states.  However, this hourly rate is all but meaningless, as Virginia has the \nlowest statutory caps in non-capital cases of any state in the nation and the caps, unlike those in \nmost states, are non-waiveable.   \n \n  Virginia and Mississippi are the only states in the country with non-waiveable maximum \nfees for court-appointed counsel.  (In Mississippi, however, attorneys are entitled to an hourly \nrate on top of their attorney fees to pay for overhead expenses, and there is no limit on this \noverhead compensation. The presumptive rate for such expenses is $25 an hour.) \n \n  45\n\n  There are 27 states that use assigned counsel systems with no maximum caps for non-\ncapital felony cases.  In each of these states, trial judges are responsible for establishing \nindividual compensation rates by case.100 \n \n  In 21 states, a presumptive maximum compensation amount for non-capital felony cases \nhas been established, subject to a waiver of the maximum presumptive amount by each trial \njudge.  Such per-case maximums are waiveable upon a showing by counsel that a particular case \ninvolved extraordinary time and effort.  The presumptive non-capital felony caps in the 21 states \nare as follows: \n \n \nState  Presumptive Non-Capital \nFelony Caps \nVermont  $25,000 \nColorado  $15,000 \nIowa  $15,000 \nNebraska  $12,000 \nOhio  $10,000 \nRhode Island  $5,000 \nKansas  $5,000 \nNew York  $4,400 \nAlaska  $4,000 \nAlabama  $3,500 \nOklahoma  $3,500 \nSouth Carolina  $3,500 \nFlorida  $3,000 \nHawaii  $3,000 \nKentucky  $3,000 \nNew Hampshire  $3,000 \nTennessee  $3,000 \nWest Virginia  $3,000 \nMaine  $2,500 \nNevada  $2,500 \nIllinois  $1,250 \nVirginia  $395 and $1,096 \n \n  Virginia ranks 50th in the nation in per-case caps for non-capital felonies with charges \ncarrying sentences of fewer than 20 years and 49th (ahead of only Mississippi) in per-case caps \nfor non-capital charges with a possible sentence of over 20 years.  \n \n  Court-appointed attorneys in Virginia are currently paid up to $112 for each \nmisdemeanor charge, up to $395 in a felony charge with a penalty of up to 20 years \n                                                 \n100 See Appendix D: “Rates of Compensation for Court Appointed Counsel in Non-Capital Felony Cases,” The \nSpangenberg Group, American Bar Association, Bar Information Program, 2003. \n  46\n\nimprisonment, and up to $1,096 for a felony charge carrying a sentence of more than 20 years \nimprisonment. These per-case caps are actually somewhat lower than what has been statutorily \nauthorized by the General Assembly.  The state has failed to appropriate enough money for the \nCriminal Fund to pay the full per-case caps, which are $120 for a misdemeanor charge, $445 for \na felony charge with a sentence of up to 20 years and $1,235 for a felony charge with a sentence \nof more than 20 years. There is no statutory cap in appellate cases; payment is set by the court \n“in an amount not less than $300.”101  Typically appellate counsel receive $400. \n \n  The following table displays the per-case cap amounts that are statutorily authorized and \nthe amounts that are actually paid.  Appendix D contains a table with information from other \nstates on what court-appointed counsel are paid in non-capital felony cases.  \n                                                 \n101 VA.

However, if an indigent defendant is charged with repeated violations of the \nsame section of the Code of Virginia and each violation arises out of the same incident, occurrence, or transaction, counsel will \nonly be compensated in an amount not to exceed the fee prescribed for the defense of a single charge.  \n103  For revocation of probation hearings, payment is allowed on the basis of only one charge.  For instance, if a defendant who is \non probation for five charges is subject to a probation revocation proceeding, the court appointed attorney would be reimbursed \nfor only one charge – the probation revocation.  The fee cap would be that for the top charge of the original five charges.  \n104 In abuse and neglect cases and termination of parental rights cases, counsel for parents receive $112 per child, per charge.  A \nGuardian Ad Litem, whose represents the best interests of the child in these cases, receives $55/hour for out-of-court work and \n$75/hour for in-court work with no cap.  \n  48\n\n  Compensation rates for court-appointed counsel in Virginia have changed very little in \nthe past two decades.  In 1985, when The Spangenberg Group conducted a study for the joint \nsubcommittees of the Virginia General Assembly studying methods of providing legal defense \nservices for the indigent and Virginia’s public defender system, the maximum fee allowed in \ncircuit court for Class II cases was $400, for Class III-VI cases $200, and for misdemeanors and \njuvenile cases $75.105  The following table compares the rates paid in 1985 with those in 2002. \n \n \nTable 6-2 \nCourt Appointed Attorney Fees in Virginia, 1985 and 2002 \nType of Court/Case  Maximum Fee Allowed \n  1985  2002 \nCircuit Court    \nFelony    \nClass I - \nCapital  Set by the court  Set by the court \nClass II  $400  $1,096 \nClass III-VI  $200  $395 \nUnclassified  Varies  Varies \nMisdemeanor  $100  $148 \nJuvenile  $100  $100 \nSet by the court,  Set by the court, \nAppeal  not less than $100  not less than $300 \nGeneral District \nCourts    \nFelony      \n(Preliminary \nHearing)  $75  $112* \nMisdemeanor  $75  $112 \nJuvenile  $75  $112 \nJ&DR Court    \nFelony \n(Preliminary \nHearing)  $75  $112* \nMisdemeanor  $75  $112 \nJuvenile  $75  $112 \n \n*Compensation is capped at $112 for preliminary hearings in the district court that are certified to the \ncircuit court.  However, representation of a defendant charged with a felony at preliminary hearing in \neither juvenile and domestic relations court or general district court that reaches final disposition at that \npreliminary hearing (i.e., is reduced to misdemeanor, dismissed, nolle prossed, etc.) will result in \ncompensation up to the appropriate felony rate.  See 2001 Va. Acts ch. 509.   \n \n \n                                                 \n105 The Spangenberg Group, Projecting Costs for Various Indigent Defense Systems in Virginia for FY 1986. \n  49\n\n  The compensation caps listed in Table 6-1 are paid per charge, not per case.  Individual \ndefendants may face more than one charge.  For multiple violations of the same offense tried in \nthe same proceeding, a single fee is allowed.  However, in charges involving more than one \noffense, counsel may receive more than one per-charge fee. Thus, if a defendant is charged with \nmore than one offense, a court-appointed attorney stands to earn more than if the compensation \nscheme applied to one case rather than one charge.  As discussed in Chapter 8, data from the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts show that the average number of charges per court-\nappointed felony case is 1.7, the average number of charges per misdemeanor case is 1.4 and the \naverage number of charges per case for all juvenile matters (there is no distinction made for \nfelony and misdemeanors) is 1.66.  One panel attorney told us that he has instructed the court not \nto call him for appointment to a case unless it involves at least five charges.  \n \n  Attorneys submit completed payment vouchers to their local clerks of court.  Court staff \nreview the vouchers for accuracy, sign them, and have a judge sign authorization for payment.  \nThe vouchers are then sent to the state Administrative Office of the Courts, which issues \npayment.106   \n \n  With pay caps as low as $1,096 to defend a client in a murder trial, one has to wonder \nhow, practically and ethically, court-appointed attorneys can provide adequate representation to \ntheir clients.  When asked if he treated cases of retained clients differently from cases of \nappointed clients, one lawyer replied he “does a legally sufficient job” on court-appointed cases. \nHe said he “can’t spend a whole lot of time on them” and that he would spend a lot more time \nwith the client that “plunks down more money.”  Some attorneys answered the question by \nsaying that they do not treat retained clients differently from appointed clients, but they suspect \nmany others do.  A Newport News attorney was more candid, admitting that with a retained \nclient, he spends substantially more time looking for an issue that will benefit the client, while in \na court-appointed case he spends as little time as possible looking for an issue that will dispose \nof the case.  “If we want to make a living we have to get rid of the case as quickly as possible.”   \n \n  In Richmond, a court-appointed attorney who took over 300 appointments in one year \ntold us that they constituted 20% of his income, as he had a largely successful retained criminal \npractice.  We asked how he could provide quality service to both his appointed and retained \nclients, he said he can’t.  “In retained felony cases I work hard to investigate the case, look for \nwitnesses, consider discovery and the use of an outside expert.”  In felony cases for court-\nappointed clients, “I tell them to investigate the case themselves, look for witnesses and if they \nfind them bring them to the office or to court. Frequently I interview the witnesses just before \ntrial and hope they will help the case.  Sometimes they screw up the case and I have to scratch \naround for a plea.” \n \nA Tazewell County attorney told us there are times when compensation has affected his \npractice.  “On a rape trial I had, I’d rather have met with witnesses face-to-face before calling \nthem on the day of trial, but I couldn’t afford to drive to West Virginia and Tennessee to meet \n                                                 \n106 A 73-page Court-Appointed Counsel-Public Defender Procedures and Guidelines Manual published by the \nOffice of the Executive Secretary collects statutory provisions governing indigent defense in Virginia and sets out in \ngreat detail how to bill for court-appointed and GAL work. \n  50\n\nwith them.  One of the witnesses I know I wouldn’t have called if I’d met beforehand because of \nher appearance.”  Another Tazewell County attorney explained to be efficient she assigns a legal \nassistant to her court-appointed cases.  “Even on cases where all the evidence is there and the \ndefendant is pleading, I still go over $112.  We try to spend as little time as possible.” A \nRoanoke lawyer said, “while you do the best you can, you cannot put in the amount of time you \nshould…You certainly have no time to go out and do investigations.”  Another lawyer said, \n“Raising constitutional issues in a court-appointed case is almost unheard of.  I can’t afford to \nwaste all my time on cases I’m not going to be compensated on.”   \n \n  Over and over, private attorneys explained to us that in order to make court-appointed \nwork worthwhile, you have to do a volume practice.  As one attorney told us, “To make taking \nappointed cases work, you have to hustle and hope there’s economy of motion….go to the jail \nand see 10 people at once…get judges to set your cases 2-8 per day.  It’s not worth it to have one \ncase for $112 and have to go to court two or three times.”   One court-appointed attorney in \nNewport News said he will wait three to four weeks after appointment to visit in-custody clients \nso he can visit six or seven in the same trip to the jail.   \n \nThere is no question that attorneys who are juggling four, five, eight defendants in one \nmorning, and hoping to plead them out that day, are doing virtually nothing for their individual \nclients.  \n \n  A circuit court clerk who felt that assigned counsel are not paid enough ran through bare \nminimum tasks that have to be done in a criminal case - set up a file, copy the warrant for the \nfile, determine if the case needs discovery, send a letter to defendant, subpoena witnesses, meet \nthe client at jail, go to court for one or more appearances - and concluded, “there’s no way to \nphysically do it all in less than four hours.” He said he figures attorneys “wing it” in court.   \n \n  One private attorney told us that attorneys have an incentive to steer defendants into \nguilty pleas in one appearance.  According to this attorney, “There is a special disincentive to \nadvise the client to go to a jury trial.  You will almost always lose money on a jury trial.  Bench \ntrials, on the other hand, don’t take any more time than a guilty plea.” \n \n  The per-charge statutory caps sparked strong complaints, separate and apart from the \nproblem of their inadequacy.  A recurring issue stems from payment for multiple charges, which, \nif resolved on the same date, may (or may not) be treated as \"one case\" for payment purposes, \neven when the charges arise from separate incidents.  One Manassas attorney we interviewed \nwrote to the chief judge in Prince William County requesting that her name be taken off the list  \nafter her bill for $1,185 for three felony pleas was reduced by the trial judge to $395.  The \nattorney felt that her bill had been erroneously and arbitrarily reduced. \n   \n  Another attorney was appointed to represent a defendant on a charge of distribution of \ncocaine, which as a life felony carries a cap of $1,096.  However, since the case pleaded out to a \nreduced charge of simple possession, counsel was paid only $395, the cap applicable to felony \ncases with a sentence of 20 years or less. \n \n  51\n\n  Although these disputes center on the proper interpretation of Code §19.2-163, the real \nproblem arises because lawyers feel \"shortchanged\" when bills believed to be inadequate to \nbegin with are reduced by the judge.  The problem seems exacerbated by the fact that there does \nnot appear to be any reliable mechanism in place by which bills can be challenged.  By virtue of \nthe Virginia Supreme Court's \"21-day\" rule, the trial court loses jurisdiction to do much of \nanything on a case more than 21 days after sentencing, but counsel will typically not know that a \nbill has been reduced until it is paid, long after the 21 days have expired.107 \n \n  We also heard of some inventive end-runs around the statutory caps.  For instance, \ncounsel appointed to represent a parent in a termination of parental rights proceeding is entitled \nto a fee for every child who might be removed. Such proceedings typically occur in two stages:  \nfirst adoption by the foster care provider, and then termination of rights.  So, in a case involving \ntwo children, counsel might end up receiving four fees. \n \nLow Fee Caps Lead to Attrition  \n \n  The low compensation for court-appointed lawyers has resulted in some experienced \nattorneys taking fewer court-appointed cases. One judge, noting his worry that he would not be \nable to find enough private attorneys willing to take appointments, tries to avoid appointing \ncounsel in certain cases by pressing the Commonwealth’s attorneys to state that jail time will not \nbe requested.  Some more experienced attorneys interviewed said they were taking fewer and \nfewer court-appointed cases in state court and were taking more and more federal appointed \ncases because of the better compensation in federal court ($90 an hour with a waiveable fee cap \nof $5,200 in felony cases).  One attorney, who had been practicing for 11 years, said, “No \nattorney with any self respect will do these cases any longer than he has to.”  He accepted court-\nappointed cases when he was just getting started, and then stopped as soon as possible.  \n \n  While experienced lawyers remain on panels in a number of jurisdictions, they often \nsharply limit the number of appointed cases once they have a solid private practice.  \n“Experience” does not always equate with “quality” and a number of lawyers with years of \ncriminal law experience rely on court-appointed work for the majority of their income. Many of \nthe lawyers who take the highest number of court-appointed cases are sole practitioners who \nhave “essentially no staff,” most commonly, just a secretary.  One attorney who stopped taking \ncourt-appointed cases called the level of representation provided by those who stay active on the \npanels “laughable.”  Another experienced lawyer, who does capital cases, explained that \nattorneys get onto panels when “nothing else is working for them.”  Critical of the quality of \nrepresentation provided by such lawyers, he said they will plead a client guilty “in a heartbeat.  \nWorse, they don’t even know when to plead.”  An experienced panel attorney from Prince \nWilliam County explained there is no oversight of the work done by panel attorneys and said, \n“There will always be bottom feeders willing to do the work for virtually nothing.” \n \n                                                 \n107 Under Rule 1:1, \"all final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the \ncontrol of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of \nentry, and no longer.\"  VA. SUP. CT. R. 1:1.  See, e.g., Patterson v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 610, 575 S.E.2d \n583 (2003). \n  52\n\n  A Fredericksburg attorney summed up the situation as: “The legislature has been a slap- \nin-the-face insult to the defense bar,” and pointed out that it is not just a matter that they are \nunderpaid but also that the practice of criminal defense in Virginia has gotten substantially more \ndifficult in recent years as the stakes for criminal defendants have gotten higher.  For example, \nparole was abolished, the time required for convicted felons to serve was changed from one-third \nof their sentence to 85 percent of their sentence, harsh sentencing measures were enacted, and \ncourts have whittled down constitutional protections. These changes make it more difficult and \ntime consuming to properly represent a defendant. \n \nCourts Have Discouraged Attorney Complaints About the Assigned Counsel System \n \n  In Webb v. Commonwealth,108 the Court of Appeals addressed the issue of whether the \nstatute prescribing unwaiveable caps on court-appointed attorney fees, as applied to a \ndefendant’s court-appointed attorney, deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to \neffective counsel and due process.  The crux of the argument put forth by Webb, an indigent \ndefendant charged with multiple serious charges in Henrico County, was that the low and \ninflexible case caps for court-appointed cases created a conflict of interest by pitting his court-\nappointed lawyer’s personal financial interest against his duty to effectively represent his \nindigent client.   \n \n  The Court of Appeals rejected Webb’s assertion as it applied to his lawyer’s \nperformance.  At the time of Webb’s objection, however, a Henrico County judge who had read \na newspaper article about the Webb case announced that any court-appointed lawyer appearing \nbefore him who felt similarly conflicted would be removed from his or her case and removed \nfrom the county’s list off of which judges made appointments.  While this was the reaction of \njust one judge in one county to the Webb case, we were told that no other court-appointed lawyer \nhas attempted to raise concerns about the indigent defense system in individual cases anywhere \nelse in Virginia. \n \n  Individual defendants are also effectively precluded from challenging the deficiencies in \nthe indigent defense system following their conviction.  In Virginia, unlike many other states, a \nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not permitted on direct appeal.  It may only be raised \nin state habeas, or post-conviction, proceedings.  However, Virginia does not provide a right to \ncounsel for indigent defendants in state habeas proceedings in non-capital cases, thus the only \nway such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can be raised is by a pro se application.  In \nother words, a person who has been convicted and believes the representation provided by his \nappointed lawyer was legally deficient would have to prepare and file a claim himself.  This is an \nentirely unrealistic burden to place on a layperson.109   \n \n                                                 \n108 32 Va. Ct. App. 337, 528 S.E.2d 138 (2000). \n109 The legal standard for a successful ineffectiveness claim is extremely strict.  A defendant must show, first, that \nhis “attorney’s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, \n688 (1984), and second, that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for this deficient conduct the result of the \ntrial would have been different.” Id. at 694.  Dissatisfied defendants, even those with new counsel assisting them, \nvery rarely convince courts of this two-prong standard.  \n  53\n\n \nDisparity in Pay for Court-Appointed Counsel and GALs in Cases Involving Children  \n \n  GALs appointed to represent children in abuse and neglect, termination of parental rights \nor child support cases are paid $55 an hour for work performed out of court and $75 an hour for \nin-court work with no cap.  Court-appointed attorneys representing parents in abuse and neglect \nor termination of parental rights cases may receive a maximum of $112. One court-appointed \nattorney told us she spent 100 hours working on a termination of parental rights case.  Another \nattorney who was appealing a case in Circuit Court was in court from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and \nearned the $148 maximum.  This attorney said she suspects that lots of parents’ cases don’t get \nappealed because of the poor pay.  A number of attorneys candidly admitted that there is \ndisincentive to do all that could be done when representing a parent in abuse and neglect cases \nbecause of the fee ceiling.  Specifically, one attorney noted that there is a temptation to not \nfollow up on leads that may or may not produce a good outcome.  If you know something has \nmerit, “every lawyer is going to do it” but for other investigation and effort on something that \nmay be a stretch, it’s not worth it for $112. \n \nJ&DR Court  \n \n  A common refrain from numerous court-appointed attorneys was that they refused to \naccept cases in juvenile and domestic relations court, as the structure of the J&DR court made it \ndifficult to do volume work and thus make a reasonable living.  Juvenile delinquency cases in \nJ&DR court cases typically require more court appearances than do cases in general district \ncourt, as sentencing is commonly done at a separate hearing from the adjudication.  \nMisdemeanor cases being resolved by plea in general district court are frequently resolved in one \ncourt appearance combining adjudication and sentencing.  Many attorneys interviewed felt it was \nnot worthwhile to make two appearances for a $112 case, especially when there may be an hour \nor more of waiting time before each hearing.   \n \n  We received a number of reports from private attorneys that lengthy waiting times pose a \ndisincentive to accept court-appointed cases in J&DR courts.  Because of their wide-ranging \njurisdiction, J&DR courts must hear many different matters and scheduling can be burdensome.  \nWe received a report in one county that in a felony case, it can take between four and five \nmonths from arraignment to preliminary hearing in J&DR court.  In another county, an attorney \nwho no longer takes any juvenile cases said that it could take all day in court before being heard \non a case.  She stopped taking juvenile cases because she “[couldn’t] even break even taking \ncases in [J&DR] court.”  We were told that in Buchanan, Russell and Dickinson counties, the \nJ&DR court has to call attorneys and plead with them to take cases. An attorney in Roanoke tried \nto take only GAL appointments because the other cases in J&DR court paid too little, but the \njudge refused to let him take just the “gravy cases.” \n \n  Data from the AOC on average payments in GAL cases refutes the notion that GAL \nappointments are “gravy” cases.  Even though there is no per-case cap for GAL cases, the \naverage payment per case is low, just $289.  Such a low average fee suggests that GALs do not \n  54\n\nspend a great deal of time on individual cases; less than five hours per case in cases that can stay \nin the court system for years.   \n  A private attorney in Fairfax who takes GAL cases described the juvenile court system as \n“a wreck.  GALs never talk to their clients before the five-day hearing.  They don’t do any \ninvestigation.  They seldom talk to the lawyer for the Department of Human Services. They just \nshuffle papers and go on to the next case.”  The lawyer, who tries to strictly limit the number of \nnew cases she accepts in order to adequately work them, said that if lawyers refuse to accept \nevery case for which they are asked to serve as GAL, they are threatened with being taken off the \nlist.  She was seriously considering removing her name from the list.  A Richmond attorney who \ndoes GAL work said she does not bill for all of the hours she works as she fears she will not get \nmore appointments if she bills for all the time she puts in.   \n \nAppeals  \n \n  The right to counsel for indigent defendants on first appeal was mandated by the United \nStates Supreme Court in Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963).  The type of systems to be \nemployed providing representation to indigents on appeal and the method of funding, however, \nwere left to the states to decide. In Virginia, appeals are handled both by court-appointed lawyers \nand public defenders and the state pays all of the costs of the representation. \n \n  There is no established hourly rate for court-appointed lawyers handling appellate cases \nin Virginia; it is up to the appellate courts to set pay on a case by case basis in an amount not less \nthan $300.  Frequently in non-capital cases lawyers are paid a flat fee of $400.  If a court-\nappointed attorney were to bill $90 an hour for work on an appeal, as for trial cases, that would \ncover 4.4 hours of work.  Statewide, the average amount paid per appointed non-capital appellate \ncase in FY 2002 was $578.  If lawyers were charging $90 an hour, that would amount to 6.4 \nhours of work.   \n \n  Direct appeals in non-capital cases proceed in a two-step process in Virginia: an initial \npetition is filed and, if the Court of Appeals grants review on the merits of any issues raised, a \nsecond brief is prepared on those issues.   Small amounts of additional pay are granted if an \ninitial brief is granted review on the merits, if oral argument is heard, and if a case is prepared for \nappeal in the Virginia Supreme Court.  Direct appeals in capital cases are heard by the Supreme \nCourt.  \n \n  A court-appointed lawyer is expected to pursue any appeal arising from an appointed \ncase he or she handles in the trial courts.  Vigorous appellate advocacy is essential to effective \ncriminal defense work.  In some cases, effective appellate advocacy can entail making numerous \napplications to appellate courts.  For example, following denial of a petition to review by a single \njudge of the Court of Appeals, counsel may ask that a three-judge panel review the case.   If the \nCourt refuses to hear the petition en banc, counsel can apply to the Virginia Supreme Court.  In \naddition to seeking review of the petition, if an appeal is accepted for review on the merits, \ncounsel may and should request that oral argument be heard. \n \n  55\n\n  Virginia’s compensation system for court-appointed counsel makes it extremely unlikely \nthat counsel will be able to vigorously pursue the full panoply of appellate review available to \ntheir clients.  Despite the merit of the case, there would be no additional compensation for a \nlawyer to seek rehearing by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. Further, appellate work \nis very time consuming and is governed by strict time deadlines for filing the notice of appeal, \nperfecting the record, submitting the initial petition for appeal, submitting any petitions for \nrehearing, etc. To help illustrate the lack of effort court-appointed counsel put into their cases, \nthe lawyer who represented the defendant in Webb v. Commonwealth110 included a section in his \nlegal brief discussing the high incidence of procedural defaults by court-appointed counsel that \nresulted in dismissal of their appeals.  The information was obtained by reviewing the orders of \nthe Court of Appeals issued in the three months prior to filing his brief. The summary of his \nreview read: \n \nDuring the past three months (April, May and June, 1999), 55 indigent defendants \nwere denied their right to appeal in this Court solely because their court-appointed \nattorneys were incapable of accomplishing the timely filing of a Notice of Appeal, \na transcript, or a Petition for Appeal….Not one of these instances involved the \nexercise of judgment or strategy; the attorney in each instance simply failed to \nunderstand and apply a Rule in a timely fashion.  These are the attorneys who \nrepresent indigent defendants in Virginia. \n \n  There are no caseload or performance standards or requirements for indigent defense \nattorneys handling non-capital appeals in Virginia.  In the February 22, 2002 Virginia Crime \nCommission report submitted to respond to House Joint Resolution 178, there is a \nrecommendation to “create a special task force to examine the feasibility of implementing a \nsystem of quality review for those attorneys who do court appointed work in Virginia.”  The \ncommentary to the recommendation states that “the literature review and survey analysis \nrevealed problems with attorneys failing to maintain minimal standards of quality in their \nrepresentation of indigent defense.”  This statement clearly applies to the court-appointed system \nfor appeals in Virginia, based upon the above data that suggests the average amount of time that \na lawyer spends on appeals is less than 10 hours per case. \n \n  At a minimum, work on an appellate case entails a review of the transcript and record, \nissue spotting, research, and care in drafting.  Putting fewer than 10 hours of work into an \nappellate case is an extremely small amount of effort.  To understand how far this is off national \nnorms we once again reference national standards developed for both trial and appellate cases: \nAmerican Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 5-5.3 on workload of \nassigned counsel and public defenders; National Legal Aid and Defender Association, Standards \nfor Appellate Defender Offices, 1982, and the National Advisory Commission on Criminal \nJustice, Standard 13.12.  As mentioned previously, the National Advisory Commission on \nCriminal Justice recommended that a full-time public defender working exclusively on appeals \nhandle no more than 25 appeals per attorney per year.  Commentary to the ABA and NLADA \nstandards endorse this figure as reasonable. \n \n                                                 \n110 32 Va. Ct. App. 337, 528 S.E.2d 138 (2000). \n  56\n\n  Another informative source is a Florida Supreme Court opinion, In Re: Amendment to \nFlorida Rules of Criminal Procedure,111 where the Court cited a Special Commissioner’s report \nthat looked at the productivity and workload of Florida’s Second District Court of Appeals \nfollowing a motion by the district’s Public Defender based upon assigned excessive caseloads in \nthat court.  The Commissioner held a number of days of hearings and reviewed considerable \nexpert evidence and documentary evidence on the standards which have been adopted by state \nand national groups.  During the hearing, evidence contained in a survey of a number of states \nshowed that “in the majority of states, attorneys filed between 20-30 initial briefs per year.  None \nof the surveyed states did more than 50 cases per year.” \n \n   In the last decade, quantitative workload studies have been conducted in several states \nfor indigent defense attorneys, prosecutors and judges.  The studies were designed to establish \nworkload measures that reflected the time needed for each of these criminal justice agencies to \ndispose of criminal cases during the course of a year.  In these studies, caseload standards and \nmeasures were developed from detailed, quantitative time sheets kept by public defenders over a \nperiod of time.  Such indigent defense studies have been conducted by The Spangenberg Group \nfor indigent defense programs in Colorado, Tennessee, Minnesota, Wisconsin, King County, \nWashington, New York City and Maricopa and Pima County, Arizona (see Table 5-2). \n \n  In each of these studies, a number of billable hours is calculated based upon full-time \nwork, less vacation, sick time, training, administrative time, etc.  The average yearly billable \ntime among all of the studies averaged 1,730 hours per attorney per year. Assuming that the \nannual number of appellate cases handled exclusively by a full-time lawyer (one working 1,730 \nbillable hours) was 25 (the NAC standard), the average hours per appellate case would be 69.  At \n35 cases per year, the average number of hours per case would be 49. \n \n  Numerous Virginia panel attorneys interviewed commented that they do not like to \nhandle appellate cases due to the low compensation. Time requirements for filing are \nunforgiving.  Oral argument is a burden for court-appointed attorneys who do not live in \nRichmond; no compensation is provided for the time to drive to and from Richmond.  Low pay is \na major deterrent to take the time necessary to review a transcript, conduct legal research and \nwrite a compelling petition. \n \nAssigned Counsel Caseload  \n \n  Certainly it is not just public defenders who have high caseloads in Virginia.  One court-\nappointed attorney said that he handled over 300 appointed cases in 2002, including five jury \ntrials. Another lawyer, a former public defender, said in her first nine months in private practice, \nshe opened 400 appointed cases.  That figure dropped over subsequent years to 330, 275, and \nnow she opens 200 appointed cases “tops.”  Court-appointed cases make up one-quarter to one-\nthird of her workload.  With this level of caseload, she is able to talk to clients’ family members \nand loved ones.  “Public defenders don’t have time for this, but that’s what really helps your \nprivate practice.”  She said she can’t see how attorneys with only court-appointed practices can \ndo well for their clients, as in order to make a living as a court-appointed attorney, you must do a \n                                                 \n111 Case No. 92,026 and Case No. 82,332, Supreme Court of Florida, March 18, 1998 \n  57\n\nvery high volume of cases.  “Just the perception by their clients of someone who’s juggling a \nbunch of files and doesn’t recognize them in court is bad.” \n \n  As previously discussed, one of the salient deficiencies of the court-appointed system in \nVirginia is that there is no oversight provided and no minimum standards and guidelines.  One \nway in which the lack of oversight manifests is that a disproportionate number of cases are \nassigned to a small group of attorneys.  Such a practice is inconsistent with Virginia Code Sec. \n19-2-159, which provides that, “court-appointed counsel must be selected by a fair system of \nrotation among bar members who volunteer to take these cases and whose practice before the \ncourt regularly includes representation of persons in criminal cases.” There is no attempt to \nmonitor the number of case appointments made to court-appointed attorneys, many of whom \nhave private practices in addition to their court-appointed work.  In fiscal year 2002, data \nobtained from the Administrative Office of the Supreme Court of Virginia showed that there \nwere 80 court-appointed attorneys who received and were paid for more than 400 individual \ncases during the year. \n \nTable (6-3): Court-Appointed Attorneys \nReceiving More Than 400 Cases in FY 2002 \n \nNumber of Cases  Number of \nAttorneys \n400-450  25 \n451-500  22 \n501-525  7 \n526-550  7 \n551-575  2 \n576-650  9 \n651-750  4 \n751-917  4 \nTotal  80 \n \n \nThe 80 court-appointed attorneys who handled more than 400 cases in FY 2002 represent \nonly 2.7 percent of the 2,931 lawyers who handled one or more court-appointed cases that year.  \nHowever, collectively, they received more than 17 percent of the $56 million spent on appointed \ncounsel.  Also, collectively, the 80 lawyers handled over 22 percent of the total 215,640 cases.   \n \n  A caseload in excess of 400 cases, in addition to a private practice, is extreme by any \nmeasure. One panel attorney we interviewed handled over 400 cases in FY 2002 evenly split \nbetween GAL appointments and cases as appointed counsel in J&DR court.  The attorney \nadmitted he does very little on any of his court-appointed case.  He says he had no incentive to \ndo “the kinds of things that are necessary” on the cases.  He seldom interviews clients before \ncourt and does virtually no investigation.  \n \n  58\n\nCHAPTER 7 \nFACTORS AFFECTING THE PRACTICE OF BOTH PUBLIC \nDEFENDERS AND APPOINTED COUNSEL IN VIRGINIA \n  The previous two chapters document the problems affecting public defender and assigned \ncounsel systems in Virginia, problems stemming from inadequate resources and lack of proper \noversight that induce the lawyers to do as little as possible for their clients.  In addition, there are \na number of characteristics of Virginia’s criminal justice system that complicate the job of a \ncriminal defense attorney - whether court-appointed or retained by a paying client.  However, \nbecause of the low expectations of indigent defense lawyers, and the incentives to do little as \nquickly as possible, these factors affect indigent defendants disproportionately compared to \ndefendants who can afford to hire lawyers.   \n \nInadequate Access to Experts and Investigators  \n \n  One of the most striking discoveries of our site work in Virginia is the complete \ninadequacy of access by public defenders and court-appointed counsel to court-approved experts \nand a similar inadequacy of access of court-appointed counsel to court-approved investigators.  \nABA Standard 5-1.4 states: \n \n[A jurisdiction’s] legal representation plan should provide for investigatory, \nexpert, and other services necessary to quality legal representation.  These \nshould include not only those services and facilities needed for an effective \ndefense  at  trial  but  also  those  that  are  required  for  effective  defense \nparticipation in every phase of the process….”112 \n   \n  Guideline 4.1 of the NLADA Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense \nRepresentation states, “Counsel has a duty to conduct an independent investigation regardless of \nthe accused’s admissions or statements to the lawyer of facts constituting guilt. The investigation \nshould be conducted as quickly as possible.”  \n \n  Public defenders and court-appointed counsel have a professional responsibility to \nzealously represent their clients and to analyze both the factual and legal issues in the case.  \nAppropriate requests for and use of expert services and investigators are implicit in meeting \nethical obligations lawyers have to their clients.113 \n \n \n                                                 \n112 ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, PROVIDING DEFENSE SERVICES (3d ed. 1992) [hereinafter ABA \nPROVIDING DEFENSE SERVICES]. \n113 See VA. R. OF PROF’L CONDUCT, Preamble (“As an advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client’s position \nunder the rules of the adversary system.”); R. 1.3 Diligence, cmt. 1 (“A lawyer should act with commitment and \ndedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client’s behalf.  However, a lawyer is not \nbound to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.”); R. 1.1 Competence, cmt. 5 (“Competent \nhandling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem, \nand use of methods and procedures meeting the standards of competent practitioners.”). \n  59\n\n  Experts  \n \n  Availability of necessary expert services is essential to effective representation in many \ncases.  Commentary to ABA Standard 5-1.4 states:  \n \nQuality legal representation cannot be rendered either by defenders or by \nassigned counsel unless lawyers have available other supporting services in \naddition to secretaries and investigators.  Among these are access to necessary \nexpert  witnesses,  as  well  as  personnel  skilled  in  social  work  and  related \ndisciplines to provide assistance at pretrial release hearings and sentencing.  \nThe quality of representation at trial, for example, may be excellent and yet \nunhelpful  to  the  defendant  if  the  defense  requires  the  assistance  of  a \npsychiatrist or handwriting expert and no such services are authorized or \navailable.114 \n \nThe lack of access to expert services for indigent defense counsel in Virginia is a \npervasive and long-standing problem in each circuit we visited.  In a criminal case, the \nprosecution has at its disposal a number of state experts, including crime investigation and \nlaboratory experts, psychiatrists, scientists, and medical experts.  In order to confront the \nwitnesses against him, including a state expert witness, a defendant often needs an expert to \nconduct the same analysis and provide another, independent opinion.  In addition to confronting \nthe state’s evidence or expert, a defendant may need an expert in order to present a defense, such \nas insanity or battered woman’s syndrome, to test forensic evidence, such as DNA evidence, or \nto evaluate fingerprint, handwriting, ballistics or crime scene evidence.   \n \n  A private defendant with resources can hire an expert of his or his attorney’s choosing \neither to challenge the state’s expert or to perform an independent investigation or analysis, and \nmay do so without informing the prosecution.  Public defenders and court-appointed counsel \nmust seek approval for funds to hire an expert.  In Virginia, the standard showing required in \norder to receive an expert other than one reviewing the defendant’s mental health is very high.  \nHusske v. Commonwealth is the leading authority in Virginia for the proposition that once an \nindigent defendant in a case makes a proper showing of the need for expert assistance, the trial \njudge deprives the defendant of due process of law in refusing to provide such an expert.115  To \nbe granted, however, an indigent’s request for an expert must demonstrate that the subject that \nnecessitates the assistance of the expert is likely to be a significant factor in his or her defense \nand that he or she will be prejudiced by the lack of expert assistance.  The accused must \ndemonstrate a particularized need for the requested services and that prejudice will result if they \nare not provided.116 \n                                                 \n114 Providing Defense Services, supra note 113.  \n115 19 Va. App. 30, 448 S.E.2d at 332 (1996) (relying on Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985)). \n116 See Husske v. Commonwealth, 252 Va. 203, 476 S.E.2d 920 (1996); Barnebei v. Commonwealth, 252 Va. 161 \n(1996); Steward v. Commonwealth, 245 Va. 222, 437 S.E.2d 394 (1993); O’Dell v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672, \n364 S.E.2d 491 (1988); Downing v. Commonwealth, 26 Va.

App. 841, 433 S.E.2d 507 (1993).  This request or showing must \n  60\n\n \n  Essentially, Virginia statutes permit defense counsel to apply to the court for two types of \nexpert witness services: 1) experts who evaluate the mental health of defendants and 2) experts \nwho assist with all other types of inquiry. \n \n  Under §19.2-168.1 of the Code of Virginia, if a defendant in a non-capital case plans to \nraise an issue about his sanity at the time of the offense, he may seek a court-appointed mental \nhealth expert to evaluate his sanity and possibly help prepare a defense on his behalf.  Section \n19.2-169.1 permits appointment of an evaluation to determine whether a defendant is competent \nto stand trial.  Section 16.1-356 permits appointment of an expert to evaluate a juvenile for \ncompetency to stand trial.  And under §19.2-264.3:1, defendants being tried or sentenced in \ncapital cases are entitled to expert assistance to evaluate the capacity of the defendant to \nappreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law \nand to assess whether there are any other factors in mitigation relating to the history or character \nof the defendant or the defendant's mental condition at the time of the offense.   \n \n  Generally in Virginia, indigent defendants are not permitted to select their own mental \nhealth experts; typically one will be selected by the court and these are usually individuals at \nstate mental health facilities who work for both prosecution and defense counsel.  Use of a state \nexpert raises serious problems of independence of the evaluation.   \n \n  Section 19.2-175 of the Code of Virginia governs pay of psychiatrists, psychologists and \nother expert witnesses who are not regularly employed by the Commonwealth of Virginia in \nregard to questions of competency to stand trial and determination of insanity.  Under this code \nsection, experts who are employees of state facilities, with the exception of the University of \nVirginia School of Medicine or the Medical College of Virginia, do not receive any \ncompensation from the court for their evaluation. On occasion, the mental health expert used is \nnot an employee of a state facility, and such an individual must be paid a “reasonable fee” \ncapped by § 19.2-175 at $400, except in capital murder cases.  In addition, such expert witnesses \nrequired to be present at a hearing will receive a fee of $100 per day.  Section 16.1-361 sets out \nsimilar provisions for experts regarding competency issues of juveniles. \n \n  In FY 2002, experts other than those employed at state facilities were paid for evaluating \nmental health issues in 2,012 circuit, GDC and J&DR court cases and were paid $748,279 from \nthe Criminal Fund, or an average of $372 per case.  No data is available on the number of cases \nin which evaluations were made by employees of state facilities and thus were not paid.  \n \n   Section 17.1-612 authorizes payment for all other types of experts (i.e., in all areas \nbesides mental health) used by indigent defense counsel.  Data from the Supreme Court of \nVirginia disclose that payments for expert witnesses in this category were made in just 231 cases \nin FY 2002 (191 in circuit court, three in general district court, 33 in J&DR court and 4 in \ncombined district courts), including cases for both public defenders and court-appointed counsel.   \n                                                                                                                                                             \noccur in open court, with the Commonwealth’s Attorney being given an opportunity to hear the evidence and argue \nagainst the request. There is no right to an ex-parte proceeding.  Ramdass v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 413 (1993).  \n \n  61\n\nThe average claim approved for the 231 experts was $3,056.60.  In circuit court, the 191 claims \npaid averaged $3,550.25. \n \n  As Table 7-1 shows, in FY 2002, Virginia spent a total of $1,454,354 on experts (mental \nhealth and all other types) in 2,243 cases in all courts in the Commonwealth, for an average of \n$648.40 per claim.  Expenditures on experts accounted for less than one percent of the total \namount spent ($77,565,518) on indigent defense in FY 2002 and were made in less than one \npercent of all indigent defendant cases handled (309,911).  Of particular significance is that fact \nthat just 191 §17.1-612 expert witness payments (experts in areas other than mental health) were \nmade in felony cases in circuit court.  In other words, such experts were used in less than one \npercent of all felony cases disposed of in the circuit courts for FY 2002 (42,641).  \n \nTable 7-1 \nExpenditures for Experts in FY 2002 by Criminal Court Fund, by Court, by Number of \nClaims and Average Cost per Claim \n \nCode Section and Court  Number of Claims  Total Expenditures  Average Cost Per Claim \n§ 19.2-175: Compensation \nof Experts          \nCircuit Court  755  $353,476.00  $468.18 \nGeneral District Court  594  $188,121.00  $316.70 \nJuvenile and Domestic \nRelations  228  $70,319.00  $308.42 \nCombined District Courts  164  $57,138.00  $348.40 \nTotals  1,741  $669,054.00  $384.29 \n§ 17.1-612 Expert Witnesses          \nCircuit Court  191  $678,098.00  $3,550.25 \nGeneral District Court  3  $1,121.00  $373.67 \nJuvenile and Domestic \nRelations  33  $23,530.00  $713.03 \nCombined District Courts  4  $3,325.00  $831.25 \nTotals  231  $706,075.00  $3,056.60 \n§ 16.1-361 Compensation of \nExperts, J&DR Court, \nJuvenile Cases          \nJuvenile and Domestic \nRelations  259  $76,165.00  $294.07 \nCombined District Courts  11  $3,000.00  $272.73 \nCourt Unknown  1  $60.00  $60.00 \nTotals  271  $79,225.00  $292.34 \nGrand Totals  2,243  $1,454,354.00  $648.40 \nInformation supplied by the Supreme Court of Virginia Administrative Office. \n \n  There is no provision in Virginia permitting defense counsel to make ex parte requests for \nexperts other than for a scientific investigation relevant to a criminal charge that is performed by \n  62\n\nthe Division of Forensic Science or the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services.117  \nOtherwise, defense counsel must show the need for their requests and reveal their need, which is \noften their theory of defense, to the prosecution.  Too often, indigent defense attorneys in \nVirginia are confronted with deciding which is the lesser of two evils: revealing their defense to \nthe prosecution well in advance of trial in order to have the chance of obtaining the assistance of \nan expert; or not revealing their defense but not receiving expert assistance, and further not \npreserving the issue for appeal.  Some attorneys in Roanoke and Lynchburg told us that they \nbalance the colliding interests and frequently decide not to reveal the theory of their case to the \nprosecution.  \n \n  Prosecutors often come to court to argue against defense attorneys’ requests for experts.  \nEven if the prosecution does not oppose the motion, by attending the hearing they are able to \nlearn the defendant’s reasons for the request, the trial strategy, the name of the expert and the \nrequested amount of the fee.   \n \nIn our experience in studying indigent defense systems across the country, we have never \nencountered such a persistent problem of indigent defendants’ right to seek expert funds being \nextinguished by a widespread practice of the courts of not allowing the requests to be filed ex \nparte.  Many jurisdictions not only routinely allow such motions to be filed ex parte, but also \nhave court rules that affirmatively create the authority for ex parte requests.118 \n \n  Under the Virginia Code, the trial judge has discretion to reimburse appointed counsel for \nany “reasonable expense” incurred in connection with representing an indigent on criminal \ncharges.119  In addition to authority conferred on Virginia judges by state statute, the United \nStates Supreme Court has held that due process requires that an indigent defendant be given the \n“basic tools” needed to present his or her defense.120  However, like compensation for court-\nappointed counsel, a number of expert expenses are limited by statute.  In J&DR court, \ncompetency evaluations are capped at $300 and court appearances by experts doing the \nevaluations are capped at $100.  Competency experts in other courts are capped at $200, mental \nstatus exams at $300 ($400 for competency and mental status), $300 for pre-sentence evaluation, \nand a total cap of $200 for court appearances ($100 a day).  Alcohol and drug content analysis \n(by private lab) are capped at $50 and $75 (for drug class).121   \n \n                                                 \n117 VA.

Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 77 (1985). \n121 Supreme Court of Virginia Chart of Allowances (July 1, 2002). \n  63\n\n  Despite the authority of Virginia courts to grant reasonable expenses for the defense, site \nwork revealed a near-unanimous experience by Virginia court-appointed attorneys and public \ndefenders that courts rarely approve funds for experts.  Requests for court-approved experts are \nfrequently denied in non-capital cases and even sometimes in capital cases.  We were also told \nthat when funds are granted for an expert, the fee is sometimes so low that attorneys either \ncannot find an expert willing to perform the work or are unwilling to appear in court for the $100 \nallowed per day.   \n \n  A public defender in Richmond said of the difficulty in getting experts, “It’s as if judges \nare taking out their wallets themselves.  They just say no.”   \n \n  In Halifax, Norfolk, Richmond and Roanoke, we were told that the courts refer public \ndefenders to the state’s witnesses when they want an expert; they are not granted funds to retain \nan independent expert.  A Halifax public defender described the state lab’s experts as “cops with \nlab coats.  They are openly hostile to us.  Many of them think that their function is to support the \nprosecution.”  Public defenders are not referred to the state’s experts strictly for psychiatric or \npsychological evaluations; others mentioned being told to use the state’s experts for handwriting, \nDUI blood-alcohol level and even DNA analysis.   \n \nSeveral attorneys remarked that independence of state experts can be especially \nproblematic in evaluations of competency to stand trial.  One attorney said that the judges allow \nexperts who “merely rubber stamp competency.”  Another attorney said he had a client who \nclaimed to be seeing people and animals in his jail cell, but the resident psychologist at the local \ncommunity services center specified by the court to perform the competency evaluation said that \nthe client was competent as long as his hallucinations were visual and not audio hallucinations. \nThis attorney felt that if he’d had the money to hire a psychologist of his own choosing, his client \nwould have been found incompetent.  Another attorney said that sometimes he looks at the \ndifficulties involved in seeking a competency evaluation and simply decides not to ask for one.   \n \nMany court-appointed attorneys no longer bother requesting funds for experts, as \nexperience has proven to them that they will not be approved. It is easy to see how in a \njurisdiction where indigent defense resources are low and counsel is routinely denied requested \nservices, that the practice of not requesting services becomes acceptable and a culture of \ncomplacency is created.   As an attorney in Montgomery County said, “We don’t get experts on \nanything unless it’s a capital case.  The culture is – don’t even ask anymore.”   However \ndiscouraging it is to have requests repeatedly turned down, the failure to seek expert services \nraises serious ethical problems for court-appointed lawyers and public defenders.  \n \nStill, the fact that courts routinely deny requests is not the sole reason for the infrequent \ninvolvement of experts in indigent defendant cases.  Because of the low statutory caps on \ncompensation, many court-appointed attorneys are motivated to resolve their cases spending as \nlittle time as possible. Utilization of an expert requires time and effort: research must be done in \norder to determine that an expert will be useful, a motion for an expert must be prepared and \nargued, and if approved, an expert must be located and time will be spent working with the \nexpert.  Many court-appointed lawyers in Virginia never put this sort of effort into their cases.  A \n  64\n\nprivate attorney in Roanoke who has been taking court-appointed cases for 24 years said he has \nnever requested an expert in a court-appointed case. \n \nIn the general district courts, requests for both experts and investigations are rare.  One \ngeneral district court judge who has been on the bench for 20 years said he has never received a \nrequest for an expert or an investigator from a court-appointed attorney.  Data from the FY 2002 \nCriminal Fund expenditures show that, other than for evaluation of competency or insanity, \nexperts were allowed in only three general district court cases.   \n \nIn capital cases, defense counsel shoulders a heavy burden to provide effective assistance \nof counsel.  As Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct commentary state regarding the \nattorney’s duty of thoroughness and preparation, “The required attention and preparation are \ndetermined in part by what is at stake….”122  The stakes do not get any higher than a capital case, \nand defense counsel has an especially large responsibility to ensure that a capital defendant is \nafforded due process, including seeking expert services when necessary.  The United States \nSupreme Court has held that where an indigent defendant is on trial for his life, due process \nrequires the State to fund such expert assistance for the defense as may be reasonably necessary \nin the unique circumstances of the case.123  \n \nPart of the duty of defense counsel in a capital case is to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry \ninto the defendant’s history and where an expert is involved, to ensure that a complete and \nreliable expert evaluation of the defendant’s history is performed.124  The duty to ensure that \nthere is a full investigation for mitigation purposes is one which the courts have recognized as \nproperly being a defense counsel duty.  In its most recent decision on the subject, the Supreme \nCourt has held that counsel’s limited investigation of a capital defendant’s presentence \ninvestigation and social services records and failure to present mitigation evidence to the jury at \nthe sentencing hearing constituted deficient performance which resulted in prejudice to the \nclient.125   \n \nDuring our site work in Virginia, some attorneys said they barely get an expert in a \ncapital case for DNA.  One Richmond public defender told us a judge denied her request for a \nDNA expert in a 7-year old homicide case from Norfolk where DNA was the only remaining \nevidence.  As in most cases in Virginia, the public defender’s request for a DNA expert in this \ncase was not heard ex parte, and the commonwealth attorney successfully argued that the expert \nwas too much of an expense to the state. \n \n                                                 \n122 VA.

In Virginia, as in many states, Ake has been extended to non-capital cases and to all sorts of \nexperts, not just psychiatric experts.  See Husske v.

Smith, 539 U.S. ___ (2003), relying on Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). \n  65\n\nA circuit court clerk said that experts are only approved in “high profile” cases (e.g., rape \nor murder).  However, a circuit court judge said that he would likely never approve a DNA \nexpert; in a recent non-capital first degree murder case he denied a request for a ballistics and \nmedical expert but approved an investigator.  He said that after he approved the investigator he \nhad to justify the approval to a representative of the Supreme Court.  Circuit court clerks in \nanother county said, “Our judges don’t run a Judge Ito court here…We don’t allow attorneys to \nraise a voodoo defense here.”  Although they acknowledged that retained counsel make more \nfrequent use of experts than court-appointed counsel, according to the clerks, “the judges are \nbusy; they just want to hear the facts.” \n \nJudges acknowledged that requests for experts and investigators can be denied.  A \ngeneral district court judge in Fredericksburg said there is no funding for experts in general \ndistrict court; attorneys have to request experts in circuit court.  At a group meeting of circuit, \ndistrict and juvenile and domestic relations court judges in one circuit, the judges agreed that, for \nthe most part, defendants get experts, investigators, and voir dire in capital cases only.   \n \n  When we asked judges whether they are under any pressure from the General Assembly \nor the Supreme Court to watch expenditures on experts and investigators, a number responded \nthat they were not.  However, one judge confirmed that cost has some consideration as to \nwhether or not he appoints an expert.  He acknowledged there is indirect pressure from the state \nto not “waste” taxpayer money on less serious crimes.   \n \n  A J&DR court judge was more forthcoming about the tension between the courts and \nlegislature on costs for indigent parties. This judge told us that judges definitely get pressure \nfrom the legislature over capping costs.  When J&DR court judges are coming up for review, a \ncommittee reviews how successful they have been in ordering recoupment in GAL cases.  The \njudge recalled that when one judge was up for review, he was asked by the legislative committee \nif he had been scrutinizing attorney vouchers.  Also, he said that J&DR court judges had recently \nbeen informed that funds for psychiatric evaluations had been cut and were instructed, in light of \nbudget restraints, to scrupulously screen for indigency and be certain there is no other way to get \nthe information sought without having to approve funds for an evaluation.  \n \n \n  Investigators \n \n  Adequate investigation of a case is the most basic of criminal defense requirements. \nStandard 4-4.1, Duty to Investigate, of the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Prosecution \nFunction and Defense Function states: \n \n(a)  Defense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances \nof the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the \ncase and the penalty in the event of conviction.  The investigation should include \nefforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law \n  66\n\nenforcement authorities.  The duty to investigate exists regardless of facts \nconstituting guilt or the accused’s stated desire to plead guilty.126   \n \nThe outcome of a criminal case can hinge on a good defense investigation.  Evidence and \nwitnesses are often necessary or helpful to support a defense theory, but evidence and witnesses \nmust be located, photographed, interviewed, and/or subpoenaed to court.  A good investigation \ncan also give the defense leverage during plea negotiations. \n \n  It is frequently not appropriate for a defense lawyer to conduct his or her own \ninvestigation.  For example, it is not proper for attorneys to interview witnesses who they suspect \nthey may later need to impeach in court, because the lawyer may have to testify against the \nwitness.127  Further, attorneys are trained and responsible for providing legal representation and \noften do not have the time or ability to track down witnesses, travel to far or unknown locations, \ninterview difficult witnesses, or survey crime scenes. \n \n  Assigned counsel reported that just as with experts, although clear authority exists for \nappointment of investigators when appropriate, judges rarely approve funds for investigators in \nindigent cases and as a result, few are ever requested.  Even in capital cases, requests for \ninvestigators are sometimes denied.  Many court-appointed attorneys we met with admitted that, \nexcept for capital cases, they have never requested the services of an investigator in an indigent \ncase.  \n \nA private attorney in Roanoke who rarely got investigators approved remarked that “in \nmany, many cases, three to four hours of investigation could make a difference.”  Some attorneys \nreported that they simply do not perform investigations as they do not have the time or resources.  \nOne attorney admitted that this “could border on ineffective assistance.”  A private attorney who \nhad been taking appointed cases for 12 years said she doesn’t use investigators because the state \nwill not reimburse for them. Public defender attorneys and investigators also told us that the \nprivate attorneys do little investigation or tracking down of witnesses. \n \n  Given the reluctance of courts to approve court-appointed attorneys’ requests for \ninvestigators, one of the apparent advantages of a public defender office over assigned counsel in \nVirginia is that public defenders have investigators on staff.  For the most part, the investigators \nwe met were dedicated to their work and attorneys felt that they were doing good work.  \nHowever, as previously stated in this report, in FY 2002, there were only 26 full-time \ninvestigators for over 94,000 cases handled by public defender attorneys statewide.  Because of \nthis, frequently investigators can only devote time to the most serious of cases.  Also, public \n                                                 \n126 ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, PROSECUTION FUNCTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION (3d ed. 1992) \n[hereinafter ABA STANDARDS FOR PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION]; see also VA.

They lack basic equipment, such as digital still and video \ncameras and crime scene reproduction software, and access to criminal histories. \n \nJuvenile Justice System Practices  \n \n  In September 2002, the American Bar Association Juvenile Justice Center issued a report \nentitled, An Assessment of Access to Counsel and Quality of Representation in Delinquency \nProceedings. The report sought to identify systemic and institutional barriers that impede the \ndevelopment of an improved legal delivery system, highlight innovative practices and offer \nrecommendations for change.  The report, like this one, noted that representation of juveniles in \nVirginia had been studied and criticized two decades ago, yet little had been done since then to \nmake improvements to the system. \n \n  Our study of indigent defense services in Virginia did not look at juvenile representation \npractices with the level of scrutiny provided in the 2002 ABA report.  However, many of the \nserious concerns identified by the ABA report were also brought to our attention during field \nwork, including the following: \n \n•  Delay in appointment of counsel to juveniles prosecuted as delinquents; \n•  A high incidence of children waiving the right to counsel without prior \nconsultation with a lawyer; \n•  Inadequate juvenile-training and experience for both assigned counsel and public \ndefenders;  \n•  A need to expand the public defender system. Despite the criticism of their lack of \nproper training, many juvenile court professionals felt that public defenders \nprovided better representation for juvenile clients, yet public defenders only serve \nhalf the population of Virginia; \n•  Inadequate access to ancillary services (support staff, investigators, paralegals, \nsocial workers and sentencing advocates); \n•  Inappropriate referrals to the juvenile justice system of mental health- and school-\nrelated cases; \n•  Inadequate mental health services for children; \n•  A widespread perception that juvenile court is “kiddy court,” which serves merely \nas a training ground for lawyers handling adult criminal cases; \n•  Overrepresentation and disparate treatment of minority youths in the juvenile \njustice system; and \n•  Inadequate compensation for court-appointed counsel.  \n \n \nDiscovery  \n \n  The failure to seek and to obtain experts and investigators in court-appointed cases in \nVirginia is particularly problematic because of the difficulty defense lawyers face obtaining \ndiscovery materials.  In a criminal case, discovery refers to evidence necessary to prepare a \n  68\n\ndefendant’s case.  It can be any material relating to the defendant’s case, including police reports, \nwitness statements, defendant’s statements, physical evidence, and lab and other test results.  \nDiscovery is usually in the hands of the prosecution, yet is essential to a defense attorney in \nfulfilling her obligation to provide competent representation, which requires legal and factual \nknowledge and analysis.128  A defense lawyer must obtain discovery to adequately prepare for \ntrial, confront witnesses against the defendant, and advise the client on the strength of the \nprosecution’s case and on the acceptability of a plea offer.  Further, it can be helpful or even \nnecessary for conducting investigation, finding a theory of a case, and knowing whether a \nrequest for an expert should be filed.   \n \n  In Virginia, it is extremely difficult for defense counsel to obtain discovery materials.  \nThe Commonwealth’s discovery practices affect clients of both retained and appointed counsel, \nbut the impact on indigent clients is particularly severe.  Matched against prosecutors who are \nnot forthcoming with discovery materials, retained lawyers can devote additional resources to \ntracking down materials, such as by using support staff or investigators.  Devoting these \nadditional resources, e.g., to locating documents or interviewing police officers or witnesses, is \nimpossible for most public defender offices and unlikely for most court-appointed counsel. \n  \n  The rationale for defense discovery is grounded on fairness, and avoiding \"trial by \nsurprise\" by giving the defense advance notice of the evidence that the prosecution intends to use \nat trial. The Supreme Court has noted that while it may be the \"better practice\" to grant the \ndefendant pretrial discovery of his confession where the prosecution intends to use it at trial, the \nfailure to follow that practice does not violate due process.129 \n \n  The Supreme Court, in a series of cases starting with Brady v. Maryland,130 has \nestablished a constitutional obligation of the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence within \nits possession when that evidence might be material to the outcome of the case.  The ultimate \nissue under Brady, where the exculpatory evidence is produced at trial, is whether delay in \nproduction resulted in a violation of the Brady \"materiality standard,\" that is, whether there is a \nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense pretrial (assuming it \nwas then within the prosecution's possession or control) the result of the proceeding would have \nbeen different. \n \nAlthough there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, state \ncourts, including Virginia’s, have found due process violated where the prosecution's failure to \ndisclose certain critical portions of its evidence before trial deprived the defendant of an adequate \nopportunity to prepare to meet the prosecution's case.131 The Virginia Rules of Professional \nConduct also require a prosecutor to provide defense counsel with exculpatory material.132   \n                                                 \n128 See VA. R. OF PROF’L CONDUCT 1.1, Competence, cmt. 5. \n129 See Cicenia v. La Gay, 357 U.S. 504 (1958). \n130 373 U.S. 83 (1963). \n131 See Gilchrist v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 540, 317 S.E.2d 784 (1984) (failure to furnish key autopsy report until \nchief medical examiner testified at trial); Moore v. State, 740 P.2d 731 (Okla. Crim. App. 1987) (failure to disclose \nscientific reports and sample of drug); Wynne v. State, 676 S.W.2d 650 (Tex. App. 1984) (defense was furnished \nwith report of one of state's experts on the insanity issue only shortly before that expert was prepared to testify and \nnever received the report of the other expert); see also Clark v. Commonwealth, 262 Va. 517, 551 S.E.2d 642 (2001) \n  69\n\n \nBeyond any exculpatory evidence, however, the discovery that must be provided to \ndefense counsel by the Commonwealth is very limited.  With limited discovery material, \nVirginia defense counsel are often extremely handicapped in their ability to adequately represent \na client and prepare a defense. The material that the Commonwealth is required to turn over to \ndefense counsel differs in the various levels of court.  In district court, the defense is entitled to \nthe defendant’s statements and criminal record.133  In circuit court, defense counsel are entitled to \nstatements of the defendant, forensic evidence including reports of any physical or mental \nexamination of the defendant or alleged victim, and, upon a showing that such evidence is \nmaterial to the preparation of the defense, access to physical and documentary evidence.134  \nHowever, the Virginia Supreme Court rules specifically do not authorize the discovery or \ninspection of statements made by Commonwealth witnesses or prospective Commonwealth \nwitnesses or of Commonwealth reports or “internal documents” relating to the investigation or \nprosecution of the case.”135  Further, there is no automatic right to any allowable discovery \nunless a motion is filed by defense counsel, and the Commonwealth is not subject to a specific \ntime limit for producing the discoverable material under the rules, although may be by court \norder. \n  \nWe were told that in many cases, defense counsel do not even get the police report, which \nprovides the very basis for the criminal accusation against the defendant.  Because many cases \ndo not involve any exculpatory material, the defense may get no discovery unless the defendant \nmade statements or physical evidence exists.  In such cases, defense counsel must rely solely on \nthe client for information in order to prepare the case.  Relying only on the client for information \nis completely inadequate, as a lay client is not trained to know what is legally relevant and \nsometimes does not see what is factually relevant.  Some clients are mentally or emotionally \nimpaired, or were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident, and are \nsimply not good sources of reliable information from which counsel can prepare a case.  In fact, \nmany defense attorneys will not even meet with an out-of-custody client until they receive \ndiscovery so that they may be fully prepared to interview the client and evaluate the case. \n \nWhile some prosecutors reported to have open discovery policies (e.g., defense counsel \ncan come to their office to view all discovery material), attorneys in a number of counties said \nthat what discovery defense counsel receives is dependent upon their relationship with the \nCommonwealth’s attorney.  One attorney said that the prosecutor will refuse when something is \nrequested and tends to make things personal.  Another attorney said that the defense will receive \nmore discovery informally than by filing a formal motion for it.  In one county, we were told that \na few attorneys made the prosecutor mad by filing “unnecessary” discovery requests instead of \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(discussing limited constitutional right to pretrial discovery under constitutional right of defendant \"to call evidence \nin his favor\"). \n132 VA. R. OF PROF’L CONDUCT 3.8(d) (“A lawyer engaged in a prosecutorial function shall make timely disclosure \nto counsel for the defendant…of the existence of evidence which the prosecutor knows tends to negate the guilt of \nthe accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment, except when disclosure is precluded or \nmodified by order of a court.”). \n133 VA. SUP. CT. R. 7C:5(c)(1)-(2). \n134 VA. SUP. CT. R. 3A:11(b)(1)-(2). \n135 Id. at 3A:11(b)(2). \n  70\n\nrelying on an open file policy.  One attorney said that even when the Commonwealth’s attorney \nhas an open file policy, “odds are the whole case isn’t there.”  Some attorneys expressed concern \nover the prosecutors deciding what evidence is exculpatory and therefore discoverable.  We were \ntold that the prosecutors in one county often do not sign and return agreed-upon discovery \norders, and although they will provide discovery eventually, they avoid being bound to a \ntimeline.  \n \nAnother issue regarding discovery is the point at which it is provided to the defense.  In \nRussell County, we were told that although discovery is provided, it is not uncommon to receive \nit at 5 p.m. the day before the trial in district court.  An attorney in another district court said he \noften tries the case the same day he gets discovery.  In one circuit court, an attorney said he often \ngets discovery on “plea day,” which is the day the defense is to decide whether to plead or go to \ntrial.  Since this decision cannot properly be made without discovery, it has to be postponed.  In \nPulaski, we were told that the defense may not get discovery until two or three weeks before a \nscheduled trial in circuit court, which is not enough time to prepare the case and is cause for a \ncontinuance.  Further, the discovery of a conflict is often dependent on reviewing discovery \nmaterial.  Delays in the case and late changes in counsel can be not only costly financially, but \ncan also cause undue hardship on in-custody clients.   \n \n  The discovery limitations in Virginia were described as creating a “trial by ambush” \nsituation for the defense in some counties. \n \nThe Preliminary Hearing and Lack of a Record at General District Court \n \n  The preliminary hearing, by which a General District Court certifies whether there is \nprobable cause for the prosecution of a felony in Circuit Court, is the most important discovery \nmechanism available to criminal defendants facing potential imprisonment for felonies in \nVirginia.  In order to establish probable cause, the Commonwealth’s attorney’s office will often \nlay out its theory of the case and identify potential witnesses it plans to call at the preliminary \nhearing, giving the defense counsel valuable insight in the strength of the case and possible \ninformation with which it can later impeach the government’s witnesses.  However, we were \nmade aware of several systemic problems that effectively nullify the value of this critical \nproceeding in many cases.   \n \n  First, a lawyer appointed to represent an indigent defendant charged with a felony will be \npaid $395 if the case is resolved as a misdemeanor in General District Court.  Prior to a \nlegislative change in 2001,136 attorneys who disposed of felonies in general district court as \nmisdemeanors would only be paid up to the $112 maximum allowed for misdemeanors. In many \ninstances, the change properly rewards attorneys who work hard to negotiate favorable outcomes \nfor their clients.  However, it could also act as disincentive for attorneys to take felonies past the \npreliminary hearing and into circuit court, something that may be more appropriate in certain \ncases.  One judge said the system provides a \"small bonanza\" for defense counsel who plead a \nfelony to a misdemeanor in District Court.   \n \n                                                 \n136 See 2001 Va. Acts ch. 509. \n  71\n\n  Second, and more significantly, the General District Court, where the preliminary hearing \noccurs, is not a court of record.  Accordingly, a transcript of the preliminary hearing will not be \ncreated unless counsel moves for the appointment of a court reporter.  (Attorneys who are denied \na court reporter by a district court judge may request one from a circuit court judge, but there is \nno guarantee of success in either court.)  The need to bring such a motion (even in places where \ncourt reporters are generally allowed) tends to discourage defense counsel from effectively using \nthe preliminary hearing to test the adequacy of the Commonwealth's case.  An assistant public \ndefender in Fairfax said he waives all preliminary hearings because a) he does not have time to \nprepare and b) requests for funds for a court reporter are never approved.  Because Virginia does \nnot record grand jury proceedings, the preliminary hearing is the best opportunity for a defendant \ncharged with a felony to obtain discovery prior to indictment.  \n \n  General district court judges willingly admitted that they seldom approve requests for \ncourt reporters.  Some district court judge permit lawyers to tape record preliminary hearings.  In \norder for material from a tape recording to be admissible in circuit court or useful on appeal, a \nlawyer would have to hire a court-reporter to professionally transcribe the audio recording. Even \ncircuit court judges refuse requests for court-reporters.  One circuit court judge said that in 11 \nyears on the bench, he’s rarely approved a court reporter request.  In Prince William County we \nwere told, unless a defendant faces a sentence of 40 years or more (basically, murder, rape and \nserious robbery cases), transcripts are not approved. \n \n  In Winchester District Court, cases were resolved at the preliminary hearing stage \nwithout a plea colloquy.  Although the lack of a colloquy leaves the conviction theoretically \nvulnerable to collateral attack, the lack of any record in General District Court makes it difficult \nfor any such attack to succeed as a practical matter.137 \n \nIneffective Assistance of Counsel    \n   \n  As previously discussed, litigants may not pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel on direct appeal in Virginia; it is only permitted in a habeas petition after the direct \nappeal is exhausted.  Habeas petitions are usually done pro se because there is no right to counsel \nin non-capital state habeas cases. Occasionally judges appoint an attorney to help a pro se \nappellant.  Alternately, we were told by one attorney that a writ could be filed directly in the \nVirginia Supreme Court and upon court order, the case could be sent back to the trial court for a \nfurther proceeding.  This, approach, too, would typically be pursued pro se and is very seldom \nutilized.  An attorney who handles court-appointed appeals told us he would be able to do a lot \nmore if he could raise ineffectiveness on direct appeal.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n137 See Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20 (1992) (noting that absence of contemporaneous record of plea colloquy does \nnot automatically invalidate conviction; \"presumption of regularity\" places burden on defendant to show that \ncolloquy was defective).   \n \n  72\n\nTrial Issues  \n \n  Data from the AOC show that Virginia has a very low number of cases resolved by jury \ntrial.  Attorneys in every judicial circuit we visited confirmed that there are relatively few jury \ntrials in Virginia.  Less than two percent of the circuit court dispositions in FY 2002 were \nreached by jury trial (1,257 of 80,999 cases).  A major reason cited for this low rate is that \nVirginia uses juror sentencing, rather than judge sentencing, and jurors, unlike judges, lack the \nability to issue sentences outside of Virginia’s sentencing guidelines.  Juror sentencing is \nperceived as much harsher than judge sentencing, as judges can and do depart from rigid \nsentencing guidelines.  Commonwealth’s attorneys have the right to demand a jury trial and, we \nwere told, will do so in “nasty” cases so they have the benefit of the jury’s recommended \nsentence or can more easily leverage a guilty plea. \n \n  Another reason for relatively few jury trials among court-appointed attorneys is that jury \ntrials typically take longer than bench trials, and the low compensation discourages attorneys \nfrom putting extra time into trial.  Noting that a jury trial typically takes two days while a bench \ntrial takes one day, one lawyer said: “court-appointed attorneys can’t afford to do jury trials and \ndon’t.” \n \n  An additional factor stacked against defendants seeking jury trials in Virginia is the fact \nthat defendants who request a jury trial may be assessed the expense of the jury if they are \nconvicted.138  Jurors are entitled to $30 apiece for each day of service, a cost that could clearly \nstack up in a multi-day trial.  Other states expressly forbid assessment of jury expense on an \nindigent criminal defendant for fear that the defendant will opt to not exercise his right to a jury \ntrial because he does not want to incur the possible burden of paying for that right.139 \n \nSubstandard Practice  \n \nIndigent defense counsel in Virginia work in a system that, more so than most other \njurisdictions across the country, is stacked heavily against them.  Prosecutors have the charging \npower, discovery materials, help from police and investigators, and access to scientific \nlaboratories and experts.  Juries are known as tough sentencers.  Judges rarely grant experts or \ninvestigators for the defense.  Compensation is low for appointed counsel and caseloads are high \nfor public defenders and many court-appointed lawyers.  Yet, for many indigent defense lawyers, \nVirginia is the only jurisdiction they know, thus it is the only indigent defense culture and \npractice they know.  The culture is one where substandard practice occurs and, even worse, is \nenabled and tolerated.  As an example of how substandard practice has become the accepted \nnorm, a judge in Lynchburg told us he was unsympathetic to the workload problems of the \npublic defender office.  While in private practice, the judge said he had represented a client in a \ncourt-appointed murder case a couple of months after becoming a lawyer. We were told that now \n                                                 \n138 VA. CODE ANN. § 17.1-275.5. \n139 See N.D. R. CRIM. P. 23.1 Jury Expenses (“The expense of a jury may not be assessed as costs in a criminal \ncase.”).  The explanatory note to the rule reads: “This rule is intended to assure a defendant in a criminal case that \nthe assessment of jury expense need not be a factor in deciding whether a trial by jury should be demanded. The \nassessment of jury expense in a criminal case may tend to ‘chill’ the constitutional right to a jury trial.” Id. \n  73\n\nhe tells the public defender that she does not need more time to prepare her cases, but that she \n“just say [her] peace.” \n \nThe substandard conditions that court-appointed lawyers and public defenders work \nunder in Virginia have become the accepted norm.  This norm breeds a culture of substandard \npractice that fails to provide adequate and meaningful representation to indigent defendants. \nPublic defenders are overwhelmed with handling crushing caseloads and providing \nrepresentation with little or no training or resources.  Public defenders and assigned counsel \nsimply do not have the time or energy to spend to try to change the status quo, nor do many even \nrealize just how low the status quo is in Virginia.  The result is a culture of acquiescence: \nattorneys do the bare minimum, and often less than the bare minimum, necessary to represent \ntheir clients.  \n \nThe series of reports on indigent defense conducted and the lack of meaningful response \nby the Executive Branch and General Assembly to address the problems identified demonstrate \nthat for almost 30 years, Virginia state government has implicitly approved of substandard \nindigent defense practice. \n \nA former public defender told us that public defenders are taught right from the start to \nprioritize and to get by with the bare minimum, which often means jeopardizing the client’s \ninterests.  “You keep lowering the bar till you cannot go any lower.”  She said that only when \nshe was in private practice did she realize that there are certain practices like the “intoxication \nletter” that can be sent to get more information about a client’s drunk driving charges, because \nthis was not done in the public defender’s office.   \n \nPublic defenders in the Fairfax office were aware their performance was not optimal due \nto their heavy caseload demands. Several noted their practice fell short of Virginia State Bar \nRules of Professional Conduct 1.3(a) (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and \npromptness in representing a client) and 1.4 (a) (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed \nabout the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.)  \nThey themselves admitted that clients suffer because: they spend too little time conducting \nindependent investigation of the facts of their cases, they have inadequate client contact and case \npreparation time, they have too little time to familiarize themselves with sentencing alternatives \nand engage in sentencing advocacy, requests for experts are often denied, and Commonwealth’s \nattorneys frequently fail to turn over exculpatory evidence.  \n \n  We heard speculation from a few interviewees that court-appointed lawyers in Virginia \nput in significant pro bono time for which they can not be compensated due to the low pay caps.   \nData on the exact amount of time put into each case is not tracked by the AOC.  However, some \ndata is available on how much court-appointed attorneys earn per type of case and this data runs \ncounter to the prevailing notion that court-appointed attorneys put in numerous hours of unpaid \nwork into their cases.  \n \n \n \n  74\n\nNo Governmental Entity Serves as a Voice for Indigent Defense in Virginia \n \n  Despite numerous reports documenting the problems with indigent defense in Virginia, \nno governmental entity advocates to improve the system: not the Public Defender Commission, \nnot the State Bar, not the Supreme Court, not the Executive Branch, and not the General \nAssembly.  Attempts by the Virginia Criminal Defense Lawyers Association’s to reform the \nsystem over the years have been unsuccessful.  Likewise, the Virginia Trial Lawyers \nAssociation’s attempts to increase compensation for court-appointed attorneys over the years \nhave been unsuccessful.  The Virginia Indigent Defense Coalition was formed two years ago, \nand has been working to educate the public and others about indigent defense issues.  However, \nthe organization is grant-funded, thus, unlike these other institutional entities, does not have the \nstability to ensure it will continue to be a voice for indigent defense in the future. And, unlike a \nnumber of other states, Virginia has no statewide association for public defenders.  \n \n  Elected officials and other governmental entities in Virginia have persistently failed to act \nto ensure that indigent defendants’ rights are protected, and that they receive effective legal \nrepresentation.  \n \nDetermination of Indigence \n \n  The Virginia Code provides that whenever a person charged with a criminal offense, the \npenalty for which may be death or incarceration, appears before any court without being \nrepresented by counsel, the court must inform the accused of his or her right to counsel.140  If the \naccused claims that he or she is without funds to employ counsel, the court must ascertain by oral \nexamination of the accused and other competent evidence whether or not the accused is \nindigent.141  The defendant must also fill out a form requesting counsel and a financial statement \nand submit it to the court.  The court then determines whether or not the defendant is eligible for \nindigent defense services.  Additionally, upon request, the commonwealth’s attorney must make \nan investigation to determine whether the accused is indigent,142 although this rarely occurs.  If \nthe court determines that the accused is indigent and is entitled to the appointment of counsel, the \ncourt must provide the accused with a statement to be executed under oath, requesting the \nappointment of counsel.143  The Virginia Code provides penalties for false swearing.144  The \naccused is required to notify the court of any change in circumstances that would render him or \nher no longer eligible for appointed counsel.145  The accused, of course, may waive the right to \ncounsel at state expense, and, in misdemeanor cases that do not involve jail time, counsel need \nnot be appointed. \n \n  Appointment of counsel in cases involving children is handled differently according to \nthe type of case.  In abuse, neglect, termination of parental rights and entrustment agreement \n                                                 \n140 VA. CODE ANN. § 19.2-157. \n141 Id. § 19.2-159. \n142 Id. § 19.2-159.1. \n143 Id. § 19.2-159. \n144 Id. § 19.2-161. \n145 Id. § 19.1-159.1. \n  75\n\nproceedings, a lawyer who serves as a guardian ad litem (GAL) must be appointed.146  The \nparents of the child are liable to pay the costs of the GAL if they are deemed financially able to \ndo so.147 In cases involving children alleged to be delinquent or in need of services or \nsupervision, an attorney is appointed if the child is determined to be indigent and his or her \nparent or guardian does not retain counsel for the child.  In practice, children are found to be \nindigent almost without exception.  If the court finds parents to be financially able to pay for the \ncost of counsel and they refuse to do so, the parents can be ordered by the court to pay.  One \ncourt clerk noted that the guidelines are unclear for 18-21 year olds as to whether it should be the \ndefendants themselves or their household’s income that should be evaluated. Different judges \ntake different approaches. In custody cases where each parent is represented by counsel, the \ncourt will appoint an attorney for the child if it finds his or her interests are not being adequately \nrepresented, and the parents will be liable for the costs.     \n \n  The criteria used to determine indigency are uniform statewide. Indigence is determined \naccording to the following standards:  \n \n                                                 \n146 VA. CODE ANN. § 16.1-266. \n147 Id. § 16.1-267. \n  76\n\n(1) if the accused is a current recipient of a state or federally-funded public \nassistance program, he or she is presumed (subject to rebuttal) eligible for \nappointment of counsel; \n \n(2) if the accused is not presumptively eligible, the court must make a thorough \nexamination of financial resources with consideration to: (a) the net income of the \naccused; (b) assets convertible into cash within a reasonable time; and (c) \nexceptional expenses of the accused and him or her family.  For purposes of \ndetermining eligibility, the income, assets, and expenses of a spouse who is a \nmember of the accused’s household must be considered unless the spouse was the \nvictim of the offenses allegedly committed.148 \n \nIn most of the jurisdictions we visited, indigence is determined solely by the judge. Two \nexceptions were found in Fairfax and Fredericksburg, which have pretrial services offices \nresponsible for doing the initial screening, leaving the final decision up to the judge.   \n \nFairfax County General District Court uses a county-run program called Court Services \nto screen defendants for indigency.  The Court Services program began in 1974 with a federal \nLEAA grant in response to a League of Women Voters study that recommended Fairfax increase \nthe number of pre-trial defendants who are released on the own recognizance. Over time, Court \nServices expanded to include Supervised Release Pre-Trial for District and Circuit Courts, \narrange for interpreters, and run misdemeanor probation.  The benefit to the county is that Court \nServices can get some defendants out of jail pre-trial and relieve over-crowding.  Savings can be \nsignificant, as the daily cost for pre-trial detainees at the jail, we were told, is $115.09.  \n \nThere is no statewide data on the percentage of criminal defendants who apply for and \nreceive appointed counsel, as opposed to defendants who hire their own counsel or proceed pro \nse.  The scrupulousness of screening for indigence varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  A \nnumber of attorneys interviewed felt that counsel was appointed with too little investigation into \nresources.  For example, in Pulaski County, it was said that 98 percent of all defendants who \nrequest counsel in General District Court are found indigent. In circuit court, “unless it is \nobvious they can afford counsel,” the judge assigns one.\n                                                 \n148 VA. CODE ANN. § 19.2-159. \n  77\n\nCHAPTER 8 \nANALYSIS OF INDIGENT DEFENSE EXPENDITURE AND \nCASELOAD DATA \nExpenditure \n \n  In Fiscal Year 2002, Virginia spent $77,565,518 providing indigent defense \nservices.  This figure includes the amounts spent on court-appointed counsel, guardians \nad litem and public defenders as well as the services of court-appointed experts. \n \n  Data on indigent defense expenditure is reported in the annual publication of the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, the Judiciary’s Year in Review.149  In the 2002 \nreport, Table 61, Criminal Fund Expenditures by Activity, provides a line item \nbreakdown of all Criminal Fund expenditures, many of which clearly apply to indigent \ndefense, but some which may or may not apply to indigent defendants.150  Table 8-1 \nbelow incorporates the primary Criminal Fund expenditures on indigent defense, as well \nas the total spent on public defenders in FY 2002. \n \nTable 8-1 \nFY 2002 Indigent Defense Expenditure By Activity \n \nCourt Appointed Attorneys  $56,243,295 \nPublic Defender Commission  $  1,143,081 \nAdministrative Office  \nPublic Defender Offices  $18,553,172 \nAppellate Public Defender  $     171,616 \nExpert Witnesses  $  1,454,354 \nTOTAL  $77,565,518 \n \n \nCaseload, Expenditures and Average Cost Per Case  \n \n  Table 8-2 provides data from the AOC and the Public Defender Commission \nsetting out total caseload and the amount spent on assigned counsel and public defender \noffices for FY 2002.  (The expenditure figures do not include expert witness funds, \nappellate defender services or the cost of the Public Defender Commission \nAdministrative Office.)  Table 8-2 shows that the average combined cost per case for \nassigned counsel and public defenders in FY 2002 was $245.03.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n149 See Virginia’s Judicial System, Strategic Plans and Virginia State of the Judiciary Reports, available at \nhttp://www.courts.state.va.us/reports (last modified July 7, 2003).  \n150 Sup.

This was the first 50-state study ever \nproduced in this country setting forth indigent defense cost and caseload data for all 50 \nstates.  The report sets out 1982 data in which it is disclosed that Virginia ranked 48th in \nthe country, with an average cost per case of $111.26. \n \n  A follow-up study was published by BJS for the year 1986.  This study was \nconducted by The Spangenberg Group and showed that Virginia once again ranked 48th \nof the 50 states, with an average cost per case of $116.00.152 \n \n  While no further follow-up study has been done since 1986, based upon available \nresearch and data, we believe that Virginia would rank near or at the bottom of all 50 \nstates in average cost per case of $245.03 (the current combined appointed counsel and \npublic defender figure). \n \nComparison of Indigent Defense Cost Per Case of Virginia and Other States \n \n  As just started, the most recent indigent defense expenditure data for all 50 states \nis data from 1986.  Seeking to provide more up-to-date comparison information for \nVirginia, we were able to collect accurate information or provide reliable estimates on \n                                                 \n151 It is complicated to make comparisons between the caseload of court-appointed attorneys and public \ndefenders in Virginia because the two systems count cases differently, making it impossible to conduct cost \nanalysis without converting the data into a uniform system.  In order to compare assigned counsel and \npublic defender average costs per case, we asked the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Public \nDefender Commission what were the average number of charges per case.  For assigned counsel, the \naverage number of charges per felony case was 1.7, the average number of charges per misdemeanor case \nwas 1.4 and the average number of charges per case for all juvenile matters (there is no distinction made for \nfelony and misdemeanors) was 1.66. For public defender cases, the average number of charges per case for \nall case types combined was 1.8. All case data in this report - for both assigned counsel and public \ndefenders - reflects counts of individuals represented (defendants), not charges. \n \n152 U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Criminal Defense for the Poor, 1986 \n(1988). \n \n  79\n\nindigent defense cost per case from 10 other states for FY 2002.  The information, which \nappears in Table 8-3 below, does not include indigent defense expenditure data from \nmunicipalities.   \n \n  One factor to keep in mind when comparing indigent defense expenditure data \nfrom different states is that the types of cases included under the umbrella of indigent \ndefense vary from state to state.  In Colorado, for example, the expenditure figure in \nTable 8-3 covers representation in adult and juvenile criminal cases and appeals only; the \ncosts for counsel in various civil cases where the right to counsel applies are not part of \nthe state’s indigent defense expenditure.  Still, Virginia, which does include civil cases \n(such as GAL appointments) in its indigent defense expenditures, ranks last among the \nstates for which comparison information is provided on cost per indigent defendant case. \nVirginia’s average cost per case was $245.03.  The average cost per case among the 11 \nstates was $430. \n \nTable 8-3 \nStatewide Cost Per Case Comparison, FY 2002 \n           \nState  Case Totals  Expenditure  Cost Per \nCase \nColorado  45,675  $40,629,765   $889.54  \nOhio  130,482  $93,837,502   $719.16  \nAlabama  62,451  $37,698,403  $603.65153  \nIowa  67,957  $38,743,352  $570.12  \nWest Virginia  48,168   $24,730,658   $513.43  \nMassachusetts  201,569  $94,427,468   $468.46  \nNorth Carolina  169,590154  $73,859,355  $435.52  \nMissouri  82,206  $31,601,168   $384.41  \nGeorgia  178,655   $55,419,847   $310.21  \nMaryland  191,232  $58,528,208155   $306.06  \nVirginia  309,911   $77,565,518   $245.03156  \n \n \nThis FY 2002 ranking is consistent with data on all 50 states’ indigent defense \nexpenditures from the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics dating back \nto 1986, when Virginia ranked 48th in indigent defense cost per case.157 \n \n \nRecoupment  \n                                                 \n153 Based on the hourly rates of $70 per hour for out-of-court work and $90 for in-court work. \n154 Data assumes reporting from 98 of 100 counties. \n155 The Governor and state legislature increased the budget by 9% for 2003 bringing the total expenditures \nto $63,795,746.72.  Based upon previous year’s caseload, the average cost per case would be $330.60. \n156 Combined cost per case of assigned counsel and public defenders; see Table 8-2). \n157 U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Criminal Defense for the Poor, 1986 \n(1988). \n  80\n\n \n  Our final section on data concerns recoupment.  Indigent defendants who are \nconvicted of any charges in Virginia are assessed the cost of court-appointed counsel for \neach charge.  For example, conviction of two misdemeanor charges but dismissal of two \nothers would result in a maximum assessment of $224 to the defendant. Court-appointed \nattorney’s fees are added to the fees at the conclusion of the case as part of the standard \ncourt costs.  People cannot be jailed for failing to pay fines and costs in Virginia.  If \ndefendants do not pay their fines and fees, their driver’s license may be suspended and \nthe court reports the defendant to the Department of Taxation.  Any wages earned can be \ngarnished to satisfy the fines and costs.  We were told that the Commonwealth’s \nattorneys are, in theory, responsible for collecting unpaid fines, but not all do so.  Many \nfines go uncollected because defendants don’t have jobs, thus cannot afford to pay, or are \nunreachable because they do not have reliable addresses.  The canteen funds of \nimprisoned defendants can also be garnished to satisfy the costs.   \n \n  For the 2002 fiscal year, the Virginia circuit courts collected $4,530,538 in costs \nfor court-appointed attorneys, while the district courts recouped $4,455,943. The \ncombined figure, $8,986,481, represents approximately 11% of the overall expenditures \non indigent defense in Virginia in FY 2002.  No information is available on the \nadministrative costs incurred in collecting payments for the cost of counsel. The state's \ngeneral fund is the recipient entity for money recouped from indigent defendants.  \n  \n  In addition to being charged for the cost of counsel, indigent defendants in \nVirginia are required to pay juror fees if they request a jury trial in circuit court and are \nfound guilty.  A traffic court judge in Fairfax announced to defendants appearing in court \nthat the cost of a jury trial would run between $360 and $600.  Such a requirement could \nchill a defendant’s exercise of a right to a jury trial. \n \n  81\n\nCHAPTER 9 \nFINDINGS \nOVERALL FINDINGS \n \n  The findings below reflect The Spangenberg Group’s overall assessment of \nVirginia’s indigent defense system.  These findings are based on an extensive study that \nfeatured interviews with hundreds of individuals who participate in or are involved with \nindigent defense services in Virginia; review of reports and data on Virginia’s indigent \ndefense system from numerous sources; analysis of the Supreme Court of Virginia \nAdministrative Office database on assigned counsel; analysis of budget, caseload and \nother data provided by the Virginia Public Defender Commission; and collection and \nanalysis of comparison information from other states' indigent defense systems.  The \nfindings are also based on the perspective and experience The Spangenberg Group has \ngained studying the indigent defense systems in Virginia and other states over the years.   \n  \n1.  Virginia’s indigent defense system fails to adequately protect the rights of \npoor people who are accused of committing crimes.  The system fails to deliver \non federal and state guarantees of effective assistance of counsel for indigent \ndefendants.  \n \n2.  Two primary factors - inadequate resources and an absence of an oversight \nstructure – form the basis of an indigent defense system that fails to provide \nlawyers with the tools, time and incentive to provide adequate representation \nto indigent defendants.   \nCompensation for court-appointed lawyers in Virginia is the lowest in the nation, \nthus strongly discouraging counsel from spending more than a few hours on \nappellate and circuit court cases and even less on district court cases.  There is no \nstatewide oversight of court-appointed counsel, and virtually no minimum \nstandards or guidelines governing who should accept court-appointed cases.  \n \nPublic defender offices are overburdened with excessive caseloads that far exceed \nnational guidelines.  In addition to laboring under excessive caseloads, public \ndefender offices operate without fundamental tools of legal practice, such as \ninternet access, paralegals or updated computers, and have few litigation \nresources.   \n \n3.  In the past 30 years, numerous studies and reports have been conducted on \nVirginia’s indigent defense system, most pointing out similar problems and \ncalling for similar solutions.  Virtually every report has commented on the low \nfee schedule for court-appointed lawyers and the need to increase fees.  Frequent \nsuggestion has been made to move toward a statewide public defender system.  \nWhile the General Assembly has been put on ample notice of the problems with \nindigent defense in Virginia, legislative response to address the problems \nidentified has been completely inadequate.  Despite the fact all three branches of \ngovernment and the bar have called for substantial improvement in the system \n  82\n\nover the past three decades, the Virginia government has failed in its \nresponsibility to insure adequate funding for and representation in indigent \ncriminal cases.  Federal and state requirements mandate that states provide \neffective indigent defense services. The inaction of the General Assembly \ndemonstrates that it fails to understand that effective indigent defense is a \nconstitutionally mandated government service - not merely a budget category that \ncan be funded at whatever level legislators feel inclined to provide.  \n \n4.  The deeply flawed system puts lawyers at substantial risk of violating \nprofessional rules of conduct when representing indigent defendants. The \nCommonwealth’s current indigent defense system may well force lawyers to \nviolate several Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct when handling court-\nappointed cases, including Rule 1.1, Competence, Rule 1.3, Diligence, and Rule \n1.4, Communication. \n \n5.  There is no official state entity that effectively advocates for indigent defense \nneeds in Virginia.  No governmental entity serves as a voice for indigent \ndefense: not the Public Defender Commission, not the State Bar, not the \nSupreme Court, not the Executive Branch and not the General Assembly.  \n•  The Virginia Criminal Defense Lawyers Association’s attempts to reform \nthe system over the years have been unsuccessful.   \n•  The Virginia Trial Lawyers Association’s attempts to increase \ncompensation for court-appointed attorneys over the years have been \nunsuccessful.   \n•  The Virginia Indigent Defense Coalition was formed two years ago, and \nhas been working to educate the public and others about indigent defense \nissues.  However, the organization is grant-funded, thus, unlike these other \ninstitutional entities, does not have the stability to ensure it will continue \nbe a voice for indigent defense in the future.  \n•  There is no statewide association for public defenders.  \n \n6.  Because of a lack of response by elected officials, there has proven to be no \nmeaningful way to seek redress for the problems with Virginia’s indigent \ndefense system.   \n•  The General Assembly and Executive Branch have failed to heed the \ndozens of reports prepared about the problems with Virginia’s indigent \ndefense system.  \n•  The Court of Appeals rejected an attempt to litigate a deprivation of \nconstitutional guarantees in an individual defendant’s case (Webb v. \nCommonwealth, 528 S.E.2d 138, 32 Va. App. 337 (2000).  No other court-\nappointed lawyers have since attempted to raise similar claims.  \n•  Individual defendants who believe they have received ineffective \nassistance of counsel can bring it up on a case by case basis, following \ntheir conviction. However, in Virginia, unlike most other states, a claim of \nineffective assistance of counsel is not permitted on direct appeal.  It may \nonly be raised in state habeas, or post-conviction, proceedings.  Virginia \n  83\n\ndoes not provide a right to counsel for indigent defendants at state habeas \nin non-capital cases, thus the only way such a claim of ineffective \nassistance of counsel can be raised is by a pro se application.  In other \nwords, a person who has been convicted and believes the representation \nprovided by his appointed lawyer was legally deficient would have to \nprepare and file a claim himself.  This is an entirely unrealistic burden to \nplace on a layperson. Alternately, we were told that a writ could be filed \ndirectly in the Virginia Supreme Court and upon court order, the case \ncould be sent back to the trial court for a further proceeding.  This, \napproach, too, would typically be pursued pro se and is very seldom \nutilized. \n \n7.  Court-appointed attorneys and public defenders make very limited use of \nexpert witnesses and court-appointed lawyers make very little use of \ninvestigators, services that are essential to proper representation of clients in \nmany cases.  In part this is because judges routinely deny requests that court-\nappointed attorneys make for experts and investigators and that public defenders \nmake for experts (public defenders can use in-house investigators).  In part this is \nbecause many underpaid court-appointed lawyers and overwhelmed public \ndefenders never even bother to request these services.  Payments for experts were \nmade in less than one percent of all indigent defendant cases handled in FY 2002. \n \n8.  Substandard practice has become the accepted norm in Virginia’s indigent \ndefense system.  Indigent defense counsel in Virginia work in a system that, more \nso than most other jurisdictions across the country, is stacked heavily against \nthem.  Prosecutors have the charging power, discovery materials, help from police \nand investigators, and access to scientific laboratories and experts.  Juries are \nknown as tough sentencers.  Judges rarely grant experts or investigators for the \ndefense.  Compensation is low for appointed counsel and caseloads are high for \npublic defenders.  Yet, for many indigent defense lawyers, Virginia is the only \njurisdiction they know, thus it is the only indigent defense culture and practice \nthey know.  The culture is one where substandard practice occurs and, even \nworse, is enabled and tolerated. \n \n9.  Virginia ranks last in average indigent defendant cost per case among a \ngroup of 11 states158 for which such data was collected for FY 2002.  \nVirginia’s average cost per case was $245.03.  The highest cost per case among \nthe 11 states was $889.54 and the average cost was $430.  This ranking is \nconsistent with data on all 50 states’ indigent defense expenditures from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics dating back to 1986, when \nVirginia ranked 48th in indigent defense cost per case.159  \n \n                                                 \n158 The 11 states are: Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.    \n159 U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Criminal Defense for the Poor, 1986 \n(1988). \n  84\n\nSPECIFIC FINDINGS PERTAINING TO VIRGINIA’S ASSIGNED COUNSEL \nSYSTEM \n \n10.  The unwaiveable statutory fee caps for court-appointed counsel in Virginia \nare the lowest in the country. \n•  Only one other state - Mississippi - has an unwaiveable fee cap but it \nallows attorneys to be compensated for overhead for all hours worked at a \nrebuttable rate of $25 per hour.  \n•  Despite the fact Virginia’s statutory caps rank at the bottom nationally, the \nlegislature does not even appropriate enough money to pay the full rates of \n$120, $158, $445 and $1,235, but, since 1999, has only allocated enough \nfunds to pay $112, $148, $395 and $1,096 respectively.   \n•  Compensation rates for court-appointed counsel in Virginia have changed \nvery little in the past two decades, as seen in the table below. \n \n \nType of Court/Case  Maximum Fee Allowed \n   1985  2002 \nCircuit Court       \nFelony       \nClass I - \nCapital  Set by the court  Set by the court \nClass II  $400   $1,096  \nClass III-VI  $200   $395  \nUnclassified  Varies  Varies \nMisdemeanor  $100   $148  \nJuvenile  $100   $100  \nSet by the court,  Set by the court, \nAppeal  not less than $100  not less than $300 \nGeneral District \nCourts       \nFelony      \n(Preliminary \nHearing)  $75   $112* \nMisdemeanor  $75   $112  \nJuvenile  $75   $112  \nJ&DR Court       \nFelony \n(Preliminary \nHearing)  $75   $112* \nMisdemeanor  $75   $112  \nJuvenile  $75   $112  \n \n*Compensation is capped at $112 for preliminary hearings in the district court that are certified to \nthe circuit court.  However, representation of a defendant charged with a felony at preliminary \nhearing in either juvenile and domestic relations court or general district court that reaches final \n  85\n\ndisposition at that preliminary hearing (i.e., is reduced to misdemeanor, dismissed, nolle prossed, \netc.) will result in compensation up to the appropriate felony rate.  See Chapter 509 of the 2001 \nActs of the General Assembly.   \n \n11.  The unreasonably low statutory fee caps acts as a disincentive to many \nassigned counsel from doing the work necessary to provide meaningful and \neffective representation to their indigent clients.  \n•  The low compensation encourages assigned counsel to put in as little \neffort as possible on individual appointed cases. \n•  The low compensation discourages many qualified, competent criminal \ndefense lawyers from handling court-appointed cases.  \n•  In appellate cases, the low compensation is a clear deterrent to vigorously \npursuing the full panoply of appellate review avenues available to \npetitioners. \n \n \n12.  In addition to the problems stemming from low pay, there are numerous \nsystemic deficiencies with the assigned counsel system in Virginia that result \nin the failure of court-appointed lawyers to provide adequate representation \nto indigent defendants.   \n•  There is no statewide oversight of and no uniform standards and \nguidelines for court-appointed attorneys. \n•  There are no minimum qualification or performance standards or training \nrequirements (exception: GAL and capital cases).  Typically attorneys \nsimply ask the court to include their name on the court-appointed list; \nthere is no need to demonstrate experience or competency in handling \ncriminal cases.  \n•  Ad hoc appointment systems prevail, allowing courts to appoint cases in a \nway that places a premium on attorneys receiving multiple cases that are \nset for resolution on the same day.  The system maximizes attorney time at \ncourt, but discourages adequate attention to individual clients. \n \n13.  The lack of oversight and administration permits a small number of \nattorneys to receive a disproportionate number of appointed cases, raising \nserious concerns over the quality of representation provided to their clients.  \nIn FY 2002, 80 court-appointed lawyers (2.7 percent of the 2,691 lawyers who \nhandled at least one court-appointed case that year) handled more than 400 court-\nappointed cases apiece.  These 80 lawyers collectively handled more than 22 \npercent of all assigned counsel cases and were paid more than 17 percent of all \nmoney spent on assigned counsel; an average of $138,055 apiece.  These lawyers \nalso maintained private practices.  \n \n14.  The disparity in pay for court-appointed counsel representing parents in \nabuse and neglect cases and GALs who represent the best interests of \nchildren in these cases is unfair and illogical.  GALs are paid by the hour for all \ntime worked (at $55 per hour for out-of-court work and $75 per hour for in-court \n  86\n\nwork) while counsel for parents are subject to statutory caps of  $112 per case in \nJ&DR court and $148 for an appeal in circuit court. The pay scheme discourages \ncounsel for parents from putting adequate time into their cases. \n \nSPECIFIC FINDINGS PERTAINING TO VIRGINIA’S PUBLIC DEFENDER \nSYSTEM \n \n15.  The Virginia public defender system is greatly over-burdened and \nsubstantially under-resourced.  Effects on client representation of the over-\nstretched offices include lack of client and family member contact, inability to do \nlegal research, little or no motion practice, insufficient investigation, insufficient \ncase and trial preparation, failure to prepare pre-sentence plans and, frequently, \nburnout.  All of these factors affect an attorney’s ability to effectively litigate the \ncase, whether going to trial or negotiating a plea bargain.  Specific shortcomings \nof the system include:  \n•  There is virtually no initial training for public defenders.  Supervisors, \nwho carry full caseloads, do not have time to provide training.  \n•  Public defender attorneys carry excessively high caseloads ranging \nbetween 115 and 180 open cases per attorney and average annual \ncaseloads of 507 cases per attorney.  \n•  There are too few investigators and investigative equipment is non-\nexistent and/or outdated.  \n•  Salaries of public defender staff are not comparable to the better-funded \nCommonwealth’s attorneys.   \n•  Attorneys tend to start with little or no experience and many leave within \n4-5 years.  \n \n16.  The entity that should be the advocate for adequate resources for public \ndefender offices -- the Public Defender Commission -- has been more \nconcerned with assuring the public and elected officials that public defenders \ncan handle cases as cheaply as or cheaper than appointed counsel.  The \nemphasis has not been on educating officials that public defender offices are \noperating under conditions that make it very likely they are not fulfilling their \nprofessional responsibilities to clients.  \n \n17.  There is great disparity in resources afforded to public defenders and \nCommonwealth’s attorneys.  Across the board, from entry level to the most \nsenior positions, attorneys working as commonwealth’s attorneys earn more - \nsometimes significantly more - than public defenders in like jobs. \nCommonwealth’s attorneys’ offices have more adequate numbers of both \nattorneys and support staff than do public defenders. Most public defender \noffices, unlike most Commonwealth’s attorneys’ offices, do not receive \nsupplemental funding from local governments, further exacerbating disparities of \nstaff and office resources. Public defender offices lack the most basic of office \nequipment, such as internet access, and up-to-date and operating computers and \nprinters.    \n  87\n\nCHAPTER 10 \nRECOMMENDATIONS \n  As indicated earlier in this report, Appendix A of this study contains a summary \nof 30 years worth of dozens of reports, studies and legislative initiatives regarding \nindigent defense in Virginia.  All three branches of government in Virginia have studied \nthe system repeatedly for three decades.     \n \n  In December 1971 the Virginia State Bar issued a report entitled, A Study of the \nDefense of Indigents in Virginia and the Feasibility of a Public Defender System: Report \nof the Board of Governor’s Criminal Law Section,  Virginia State Bar, to the Governor \nand the General Assembly of Virginia. After an extensive study of indigent defense in \nVirginia was conducted, the 1971 report states on page seven: \n \nToday,  the  well-to-do-client  is  likely  to  be  able  to  put  on  a  defense \nprobably equal to the prosecution, if not often much better.  This can be \nseen  particularly  in  white-collar  crime,  antitrust  violations,  tax \nprosecutions and the like….Studies, including the one embodied in this \nreport, on the other hand, have shown that many court-appointed lawyers \nare overworked, underpaid, inadequately trained, without adequate, if any, \ninvestigational resources and thus unable to provide a full and aggressive \ndefense. \n \n  The current report is the most detailed and comprehensive study completed on \nindigent defense in Virginia to date.  The findings made in 1971 by the Virginia State Bar \nwere echoed in the hundreds of interviews conducted throughout Virginia in the summer \nof 2003 and in an analysis of the data provided by the Supreme Court of Virginia and the \nPublic Defender Commission.  In our professional judgment, effective and meaningful \nrepresentation is not being delivered to all indigent defendants in Virginia. We urge the \nstate to take the necessary steps to remedy a system that has been widely criticized for the \nlast three decades.  We recommend below several major systemic changes that the state \nshould undertake forthwith. \n \n(1) The Virginia General Assembly should fund indigent criminal defense \nservices in cases requiring appointment of counsel at a level that assures that all \nindigent defendants receive effective and meaningful representation.   \n \n(2)  The state should establish a professionally independent statewide indigent \ndefense commission to organize, supervise and assume overall responsibility of \nVirginia’s indigent defense system. \n \n(3)  The newly created commission on indigent defense should have broad power \nand responsibility for the delivery of indigent criminal defense services.   \n \n(4)  The indigent defense commission should adopt performance and qualification \nstandards for both private assigned counsel and public defenders.  The standards \n  88\n\nshould address workload limits, training requirements, professional independence \nand other areas to ensure effective and meaningful representation. \n \n(5)  A comprehensive data collection system designed to provide an accurate \npicture of the provision of indigent criminal services in Virginia should be \nestablished and implemented by the statewide commission. \n \n  The task ahead to reform the indigent defense system in Virginia is a daunting \none.  Much needs to be done, and these five recommendations should not be considered \nan exhaustive road map outlining all areas of needed improvement.  However, we believe \nthat the starting point to begin these efforts is creation of a new indigent defense \ncommission and appropriation of substantial additional state funds during the 2004 \nlegislative session of the General Assembly. \n  89\n\nAppendix A \nSummary of Reports, Studies, Legislative Action and Other Actions  \nRegarding Indigent Defense in Virginia \n \nI.  Reports and Studies \n \n●  1971 – Virginia State Bar:  A Study of the Defense of Indigents in Virginia and \nThe Feasibility of a Public Defender System, reported to the Governor and the General \nAssembly.  The Virginia Courts System Study Commission and Virginia Attorney \nGeneral, who had noted a problem of inadequacy of representation in the court-appointed \nsystem, had also been interested in the study as an adjunct to their existing efforts to \nimprove the state’s criminal justice system.  Findings and recommendations included the \nfollowing: \n• Although Virginia updated some of its compensation schedules for court-\nappointed counsel, it still did not meet the essential standard for effective \nassistance of counsel of reasonable compensation.  In 1970, the average \ncompensation received by court-appointed attorneys in a criminal case was \n$233.   \n• “Many court-appointed lawyers are overworked, underpaid, inadequately \ntrained, without adequate, if any, investigational resources and thus often unable \nto provide a full and aggressive defense.”   \n• Many were concerned that newly-graduated lawyers were using the court-\nappointed system as a classroom or that general practitioners were using the \nsystem as “a mass-practice-little preparation sustainer” to supplement a modest \nprivate civil practice. \n• A Virginia Commission on the Defense of Indigents be should be created which \nwould establish and oversee Public Defender pilot programs, and determine \nqualifications and salaries for the public defenders.  (In 2003, the General \nAssembly is still studying the possibility of creating an indigent defense \ncommission.) \n• Public Defender salaries should be equitable to the Commonwealth’s Attorney, \nand within each Public Defender Office, investigators should be provided at an \nanticipated ratio of one investigator to every three attorneys.  (Note: our 2003 \nreport indicates that as of June 2003, the ratio of investigators to attorneys is one \nto 8.5.) \n \n●  1974:  An evaluation of the first two pilot public defender programs designed to \nlook at the functioning and performance of the offices.  \n \n●  1975:  An evaluation of the public defender programs in Virginia Beach and \nStaunton conducted under grants from the Division of Justice and Crime Prevention.  \n \n●  1976 – Public Defender Commission:  An internal assessment regarding whether \nthe Public Defender offices were meeting certain standards for defense services.  \n \n  1\n\n●  1979 – Public Defender Commission:  Fourth Report to the Governor and the \nGeneral Assembly of Virginia regarding the pilot public defender offices.  \n \n●  1980 – Richmond Bar Association:  A study on the feasibility of establishing a \npublic defender program in that region.  \n \n●  1980-1981 – State Court Administration:  A report on the Public Defender system \nand indigent defense services generally.  With one possible exception, Virginia has the \nlowest fee schedule for assigned counsel in the country.  A survey showed that while \nthere was reported support for the Public Defender system, concerns included salary \nparity with the Commonwealth’s Attorneys Office and turnover. \n \n●  1981 – Public Defender Commission:  Fifth Report to the Governor and the \nGeneral Assembly of Virginia on the pilot public defender system.  The Commission \nfound that a statewide public defender system was feasible and the pilot project should be \nincreased for a broader overview statewide.   \n \n●  1981 – OES:  Report of the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme \nCourt of Virginia on Cost Containment Within the Criminal Fund recommends the \nestablishment of a statewide public defender system.   \n \n●  1982 – Public Defender Commission:  Sixth Report to the Governor and the \nGeneral Assembly of Virginia on the public defender system, stating that “a cost efficient \nsystem providing quality defense services to indigent defendants is no longer preferable \nbut appears necessary for the orderly administration of criminal justice in the future” and \nrecommending the expansion of the public defender system as determined by the \nCommission and OES. \n \n●  1982 – American Institute for Research:  A study conducted to compare the \nquality and cost of the public defender and assigned counsel system in Virginia.  \n \n●  [year unknown] – House of Delegates:  A study mandated by the House of \nDelegates required the Supreme Court of Virginia to establish a committee to look at the \nfeasibility of developing equitable financial standards for determining indigency and \nwhether or not such guidelines would be administratively efficient and cost effective  \n \n●  1982-1984:  OES conducts annual updates to criminal fund cost containment \n(court-appointed counsel) study. \n \n●  1983-1984 – OES:  Indigency Standards: Determining Eligibility for Court-\nAppointed Counsel Services in Virginia, a report to the Governor and the General \nAssembly in response to House Joint Resolution No. 76. \n \n●  1983-1986 – Judicial Council of Virginia:  The 1983-1986 Comprehensive \nJudicial Plan.  Tasks set forth for the Virginia Judicial System include to: \n  2\n\n• Support legislation to establish that, as a matter of public policy, Virginia will \nproceed toward statewide implementation of a mixed defender system with \nprimary responsibility for handling indigent cases going to salaried public \ndefenders and the private bar handling conflict and overflow cases \n• Provide self-executing legislation to allow funding of new public defender \noffices through direct transfer of monies from the Criminal Fund to the Public \nDefender Commission \n• Endorse the elimination of jury sentencing \n \n●  1984 – Public Defender Commission:  Seventh Report to the Governor and the \nGeneral Assembly of Virginia regarding the public defender system \n \n●  1984-1985 - Abt Associates, with Robert L. Spangenberg:  Study of Court \nAppointed Counsel in Virginia designed to collect all available data on indigent defense \nservices in Virginia in order to determine whether or not there was a crisis in the present \nfunding for indigent defense services and in the systems for providing the same.  The \nstudy finds: \n• Virginia has the lowest court-appointed counsel fees in the nation \n• A 15% increase in court-appointed attorney fees is required, but “is clearly only \na stopgap method” \n• Much more than an increase in fees is needed for Virginia’s indigent defense \nsystem to meet minimal national standards \n• Major structural change in the delivery system may be necessary over time \n  \n●  1985 – House Appropriations Committee Staff:  Chronology of Legislative \nActions Related to the Criminal Fund, presented to the Joint Subcommittee Studying \nIndigent Defense, House Joint Resolution No. 324.  General Assembly action was said to \nhave produced positive results such as standardized procedures and formalized eligibility \ncriteria, but also to have “aggravated existing problems with court assigned counsel \nsystem.” \n \n●  1985 – Abt Associates, with Robert L. Spangenberg:  Analysis of Costs for Court-\nAppointed Counsel in Virginia, conducted at the request of the Virginia State Bar and \nultimately for the Virginia Law Foundation.  The study found the following: \n• With only a few exceptions, the basic fee schedule in Virginia has remained the \nsame for over 15 years in the Circuit, District, and J&DR Courts. \n• For 1982-1983, Virginia ranked 32nd among the states in indigent defense cost \nper capita at $1.64, but 48th in the country for average cost per case at $111. \n• Virginia has the lowest maximum fee for misdemeanor cases of any state in the \ncountry. \n• Virginia has the lowest maximum fee for juvenile cases of any state in the \ncountry. \n• Virginia has the lowest maximum fee for felony cases in the country with one \nexception (in Arkansas for cases carrying a prison sentence of 20 years or more \nwhich has a maximum fee $50 lower) \n  3\n\n• Virginia has the lowest average cost per case for court-appointed counsel in \nstates where the predominant system is a private court-appointed attorney one. \n• The disparity between Virginia and most other states is large. \n• A 15% increase in fees would raise the average cost per case to $120.48, which \nwould still keep Virginia below all other states except Maine with \npredominantly court-appointed systems, and would not even bring expenditures \nback to the FY 1983 level. \n \n●  1985-1986 - The Spangenberg Group:  Projecting Costs for Various Indigent \nDefense Systems in Virginia for FY 1986.  At the request of the Joint Subcommittees \nStudying Methods of Providing Legal Defense Services for the Indigent and Virginia’s \nPublic Defense System, and with the financial support of the ABA Bar Information \nProject and the Virginia General Assembly, The Spangenberg Group was asked to \ndetermine where Virginia stands with respect to the current national picture.  The \nfollowing include some of the findings and recommendations: \n• Private attorneys are removing themselves from the system and some judges are \nfinding it more difficult to find qualified attorneys for appointment. \n• A lawsuit has been filed against the Commonwealth challenging the system of \ncompensation provided to court-appointed counsel. \n• The fees create incentive to spend as little time as possible on a case and look \nfor a favorable plea bargain. \n• Among a total of nine states comparable in population, Virginia is the last in \naverage cost per case \n• Virginia continues to rank 50th among all states in average cost per case \n• The maximum allowable fees in Virginia are significantly below those in any \nother state \n• The average cost per defendant for all case types combined in FY 1985 was \n$109.99, with a Circuit Court average of $165.92, a General District Court \naverage of $87.04, and a J&DR Court average of $79.66.    \n• Based on projected caseload and caseload standards, 153 full-time public \ndefender trial attorneys were necessary to handle 75% of felony, misdemeanor \nand juvenile cases \n• In order to provide quality representation, one full-time secretary was needed for \nevery four full-time trial attorney, and one full-time investigator was needed for \nevery eight full-time attorneys \n• The Virginia system in most ways fails to adequately meet minimum national \nstandards for indigent defense systems: \n- The system overall is hopelessly under-funded in terms of the average \ncost per case for court-appointed counsel \n- There is no statewide monitoring or administration of the system \n- Ancillary services are wholly inadequate \n- There is no comprehensive training program for court-appointed counsel \nstatewide \n- There is no assurance that all indigent defendants are appointed counsel \nas required by law, particularly in misdemeanor cases \n  4\n\n• It is strongly recommended that Virginia take the steps necessary in its 1986 \nlegislative session to increase the funding for its system and that some form of \ncentral commission be established to develop uniform standards for program \noperation and to provide an ongoing function of monitoring and evaluation. \n \n●  1986 – Joint Subcommittees:  Joint Report of the Joint Subcommittees Studying \nVirginia’s Public Defender Program and Alternative Indigent Defense Systems, to the \nGovernor and the General Assembly, House Document No. 15 and Senate Document No. \n11.  The joint subcommittees had the following findings and concerns: \n• The most immediate problem facing the court-appointed counsel system is a \ndecreasing availability of experienced attorneys willing to accept appointments, \nand there is a concern about the impact of the fee schedule on the availability of \nquality representation \n• A 100% increase in the maximum fee schedule would be necessary to bring the \nschedule up to the national average for compensation paid to court-appointed \ncounsel.  A minimum 15% increase is feasible, essential, and is “only a \nbeginning.” \n• Maximum fees, which have not been increased significantly in 15 years, do not \neven cover attorneys’ overhead expenses in court-appointed cases \n• A majority of the joint subcommittees do not believe that, in general, the $400 \nmaximum fee is reasonable for capital cases.  By comparison, the customary fee \nfor private counsel in a case involving the possible loss of a driver’s license is \n$500-$700. \n• The fees should cover overhead costs and “not be so artificially low as to \ndiscourage qualified counsel from accepting appointments.” \nRecommendations were made to: \n• Establish a fifth pilot public defender program in Portsmouth \n• Raise the maximum fees by 15% \n• Allow the joint subcommittee to continue its study and afford members to: \naddress problems faced by court-appointed counsel in capital and juvenile \ncases; evaluate the need to develop uniform statewide eligibility standards; \ndetermine the appropriate methods for selecting court-appointed counsel; and \ncontinue to review and evaluate administrative procedures of the public \ndefender program. \n \n●  1988 – Joint Subcommittee:  A study finds that a fee increase of 99% would be \nnecessary to reach the national average. \n \n●  1989 –Joint Subcommittee:  A report, House Document No. 40, was filed with the \nGovernor and General Assembly recommending another 15% increase in the maximum \nfees.  The report noted that inadequate funding of indigent defense leads to unreasonable \ncaseloads for prosecutors and defense attorneys, possible compromise of prosecutions \nthrough plea bargaining, inadequate representation of accused persons, crowded court \ndockets, jails and prisons.  The Department of Planning and Budget evaluated the \nsuggestion of The Spangenberg Group that a statewide appellate defender office be \nestablished, but in evaluating costs, concluded that “…[a]lthough the issue is clouded to \n  5\n\nsome degree by the low fees paid to private bar counsel, even with additional increases in \nthose fees it would be cheaper to continue the present system.”  Also noted in the report \nis The Spangenberg Group’s suggestion that a fully funded, centrally located capital \nresource center be created.  At the time, Virginia was the only Southern state which \nimposed the death penalty but lacked such a resource center.   \n \n●  1989 – Commission of the Future of Virginia’s Judicial System:  Courts in \nTransition: Report of the Commission on the Future of Virginia’s Judicial System \nrecommends that public defender offices be established with appropriate staff and \nfunding in each judicial circuit as the primary indigent defense provider. \n \n●  1989-1990 - Department of Planning and Budget, in cooperation with the \nSupreme Court of Virginia:  A Study of Indigent Defense Systems in Virginia.  Despite the \n15% increase in fees in 1989, Virginia still ranked near the bottom in indigent defense \ncosts.  With the information and support of the work of The Spangenberg Group on \nindigent defense expenditures across the nation, the report recommends two consecutive \nincreases of 20% each in court appointed counsel fees in order to bring Virginia towards \nthe middle of the states in terms of average cost on indigent defense. \n  \n●  1990 – Department of Planning and Budget:  Indigent Defense Systems in \nVirginia, House Document No. 44, a report regarding the multi-agency study of \nimplications of an expanded public defender system and modifications of the court-\nappointed counsel and public defender systems.  Findings and recommendations of the \nsubcommittee included: \n• Adoption of appropriate workload standards, staffing levels, and salary levels.  \nWorkload standards and corresponding staffing levels should take into account \ntypes of defendants, number of preliminary hearings, number of misdemeanor \nand felony appeals, and number of jury trials. \n• Funding 37 new public defender positions to maintain current workload levels \n• Funding 11 additional public defender positions to reduce attorney workload to \nan appropriate level \n• Adoption of procedures to make appropriate training and in-service legal \neducation programs available to public defenders \n• The use of court-appointed counsel as the primary indigent defense provider \nshould remain because it is currently cost-effective, although this is due in large \npart to the low fees \n• If court-appointed counsel fees were increased by 20 % in two consecutive \nyears, then a shift to a statewide public defender system should be considered \n• Examination of the feasibility of regional appellate representation and attaching \nregional appellate specialists to existing public defender offices.  (In 1991, this \nwas still not implemented due to budget reductions) \n• Greater financial support from Virginia is necessary if the indigent defense \nsystem is to remain constitutionally sufficient \n• The Public Defender Commission should continue to facilitate the creation of \nnew public defender offices and help develop local support in areas where a \npublic defender could improve quality, availability or expense problems \n  6\n\n \n●  1991 - Joint Subcommittee:  Final Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying \nAlternative Indigent Defense Systems to the Governor and the General Assembly, House \nDocument No. 48 (see also 1990 House Document No. 44), reiterating previous \nrecommendations that fees be increased by 20% “as soon as possible.”  Findings and \nrecommendations include: \n• A capital resource center is needed to fill an existing gap in capital litigation, \nand future General Assemblies should appropriate necessary funds to operate \nsuch a center as previously proposed by the Virginia Bar Association \n• Compensation for court-appointed counsel should be proportionate to the \ndemands made on the attorney, and there is currently little correlation in \nmisdemeanor and juvenile proceedings  \n• “The Commonwealth must avoid a system of compensating those who volunteer \nto provide legal assistance to persons who are constitutionally entitled to \nrepresentation at state expense which imposes upon those volunteers a \nrequirement that they subsidize the state’s obligation”  \n• The 20% fee increases proposed in House Bill No. 212 should be approved and \nimplemented as soon as possible \n \n●  1994 – OES:  An Examination of the Current System of Compensating Court \nAppointed Counsel and Alternative Methods of Providing Adequate Representation at a \nReasonable Cost (1994), delivered to the Governor and the General Assembly in 1995, \nrecommended a 20% increase in court appointed counsel fees across the board.  Support \nfor the report was found in the work of The Spangenberg Group on court-appointed \ncounsel rates in non-capital felony trial cases in all 50 states. \n \n●    1997 – Virginia State Crime Commission:  Cost Effectiveness of Public Defender \nOffices, Report of the Virginia State Crime Commission to the Governor and General \nAssembly, House Document No. 46 (at the direction of House Joint Resolution 79).  \nAmong the information studied by the Commission were other states’ rates of \ncompensation for court-appointed counsel in non-capital felony cases and systems for \nproviding indigent defense system (with reference to the work of The Spangenberg \nGroup).  Findings and recommendations include: \n• Virginia’s rate of compensation for court-appointed counsel is among the lowest \nof any state in the nation \n• The percentage of cases handled by public defender offices varies widely among \njurisdictions, with several jurisdictions reporting public defender offices \nhandling only 50-60 % of indigent cases, and several reporting large numbers of \nindigent cases being handled by only one or two members of the local bar \n• The Crime Commission should introduce a joint resolution to request the \nSupreme Court and the Public Defender Commission to study the system of \nassigning indigent defense counsel, including whether jurisdictions are using a \nfair rotating system and the methods that are being used by the courts and public \ndefender offices \n• Statutory caps on court-appointed counsel fees should be raised to provide for \nreasonable compensation \n  7\n\nThis report also looked at the rates of compensation in non-capital felonies in the \n50 states in 1995.  For a look at 2002 rates, see Appendix D.  Since 1995, at least fifteen \nstates have increased the hourly rates for court-appointed counsel as of 2002.  Most of the \nincreases are substantial, with a few even doubling or tripling 1995 hourly rates.  In \naddition, at least eight states have increased their maximum fees (all but two of which are \nwaiveable), and four have removed previous fee caps.  \n \n●  1998 – OES:  Court-Appointed Counsel and Public Defenders in Virginia - Study \nof Procedures for the Appointment and “Fair” Rotation of Counsel in Virginia’s Courts \n(as recommended in 1997 by the Crime Commission).   This study was taken in response \nto a request to further study whether the public defender was being used as the primary \nindigent defense provider in public defender jurisdictions, and whether jurisdictions were \nusing a fair rotation system in appointing indigent cases (since a 1996 study revealed that \nin some jurisdictions only one or two local attorneys were handling indigent cases).  In \n1997, OES surveyed all the courts and public defender offices across the state regarding \nmechanisms used for appointing counsel.  The study found that: \n• In most jurisdictions with public defender offices, public defenders were \nhandling over 75% of total indigent defense charges \n• Survey responses revealed a positive view of the appointment practices  \n• Cases are assigned fairly considering factors such as individual schedules, court \nand defendant needs, and opportunities of counsel to be appointed indigent \ncases  \n \n●   2002 – Virginia State Crime Commission:  Report of the Crime Commission \npursuant to House Joint Resolution 178, submitted to the Governor and the General \nAssembly.  Recommendations included the following: \n• Support the installation of public defender offices in Chesterfield County, \nHampton, Newport News, Henrico County, Norfolk, and Prince William \nCounty. \n• Modify Virginia code to eliminate the financial disincentive to appeal J&DR \ncases ($112) to circuit courts ($100 on appeal) \n• Modify the pay disparity between juvenile and adult indigent cases \n• Allow trial courts to waive fee caps in appropriate cases \n• Establish minimum training and qualifications for court-appointed attorneys in \ncriminal cases \n• Create a special task force to examine the feasibility of implementing a system \nof quality review for court-appointed attorneys \n• Establish specialized capital defense units to handle capital cases within the \nPublic Defender Commission \n• Create a task force to determine the feasibility of creating caseload limits for all \npublic defender attorneys and for attorneys appointed in capital cases \n(Note: the legislature has acted on only two of the above recommendations, \ncreating a public defender office in Norfolk and establishing a capital defense unit.) \n \n•  2002, American Bar Association Juvenile Justice Center: An Assessment of \nAccess to Counsel and Quality of Representation in Delinquency Proceedings. The report \n  8\n\nnotes that representation of juveniles in Virginia had been studied and criticized two \ndecades ago, yet little had been done since then to make improvements to the system. \nFindings included:  \n(cid:131) Delay in appointment of counsel to juveniles prosecuted as delinquents; \n(cid:131) A high incidence of children waiving the right to counsel without prior \nconsultation with a lawyer; \n(cid:131) Inadequate juvenile-training and experience for both assigned counsel and \npublic defenders;  \n(cid:131) A need to expand the public defender system; \n(cid:131) Inadequate access to ancillary services (support staff, investigators, paralegals, \nsocial workers and sentencing advocates); \n(cid:131) Inappropriate referrals to the juvenile justice system of mental health- and \nschool-related cases; \n(cid:131) Inadequate mental health services for children; \n(cid:131) A widespread perception that juvenile court is “kiddy court,” which serves \nmerely as a training ground for lawyers handling adult criminal cases; \n(cid:131) Overrepresentation and disparate treatment of minority youths in the juvenile \njustice system; and \n(cid:131) Inadequate compensation for court-appointed counsel.  \n \n●  2002 – Supreme Court of Virginia:  Court-Appointed Counsel Procedures and \nGuidelines Manual.  As of July 1, 2002, although hourly fees in misdemeanor and felony \ncases increased to $90, and in capital cases to $125, statutory caps in misdemeanor and \nfelony cases remained the same. \n \n●  2003 – Virginia State Crime Commission:  Indigent Defense Commission, Interim \nReport to the Governor and General Assembly, Senate Document No. 11 (in response to \nSenate Joint Resolution 43 and House Joint Resolution 94).  With reference to the work \nof The Spangenberg Group, the study committee analyzed other statewide indigent \ndefense systems.  With reference to the study pursuant to House Joint Resolution 178, \nfindings included: \n• A literature review and survey analysis indicated problems with attorneys \nproviding indigent representation failing to maintain minimal standards of \nquality  \n• No ready mechanisms exist, other than the oversight of judges, to provide any \nquality review of court-appointed attorneys  \n• Handling too many cases affects the quality of representation; still, no caseload \nlimits are in place for attorneys handling capital cases or for public defenders \n• Between FY94 and FY00, the number of indigent persons represented by court-\nappointed counsel has increased by 40% \n \nII.  Legislative Action \n \n●  1920 – General Assembly:  Virginia General Assembly passed legislation \nauthorizing public defender programs in jurisdictions with a population over 100,000.  \nNo offices were established for many years in part because the funding responsibility was \n  9\n\nwith the local governments and it was felt that public defender programs would cost more \nthan court-appointed counsel systems. \n \n●  1981 – General Assembly:  The General Assembly requested a study of statutory \nand administrative changes which could contain costs of the criminal fund.  \n \n●  1982 – General Assembly:  The General Assembly took the following actions:  \n• set the appropriation for each year of the next biennium at a level equal to 1980-\n1982 expenditures plus annual caseload increase  \n• stipulated appropriation for the criminal fund, and recommended the \nestablishment of income eligibility criteria  \n• reviewed the OES study on cost containment which recommended establishing a \nstatewide public defender system \n• rejected the proposal to establish a public defender office in Alexandria and \nrequested a follow-up study on areas where public defender offices would be \nmost cost-effective \n• provided general fund support to the public defender office in Petersburg which \nwas about to lose federal funding \n \n●  1983 – General Assembly:  The General Assembly instituted cost containment \nmeasures, including:  \n  • 4% across the board reduction in fees and reduced appropriation by $352,000 \n• Provided an indigency standard and required OES to modify and implement \neligibility criteria \n• Instituted a cap on the stacking of payments for defense on multiple counts of \nthe same offense \n• Requested an audit of indigent defense expenditures in the criminal fund  \n• Reviewed second report on areas where public defender offices would be more \ncost effective \n• Determined that information was inadequate to document savings or improved \nquality \n• Refused to approve establishment of offices in Richmond, Fairfax, and \nAlexandria \n \n●  1984 – General Assembly:  The General Assembly took the following actions:  \n• Continued appropriation level for criminal fund at level of previous biennium \nplus annual caseload increase \n• Removed 4% reduction on fee schedule \n• Adjusted cap on payment for defense of multiple counts from one to three \n• Allowed fees for defense of capital murder to be set at court’s discretion \n• Reviewed and approved income eligibility standard \n• Failed to approve a fifth public defender office in Richmond \n• Reduced appropriation level by $371,000, below the level of expenditures \n \n●  1985 – General Assembly:  Legislature appoints two joint subcommittees to study \n(i) alternative methods of providing criminal defense services to indigent persons and (ii) \n  10\n\nthe feasibility and desirability of expanding the public defender system beyond the then-\nauthorized four pilot programs. \n \n●  1988 – Joint House Resolution No. 141 finds it necessary to request continuation \nof the joint subcommittee study of indigent defense to await the results of the Bar \nAssociation project and The Spangenberg Group analysis regarding methods of providing \nindigent representation in post-conviction proceedings (under a Virginia Law Foundation \ngrant), as well as a decision in the systemic class action law suit challenging the indigent \ndefense system (Giarratano v. Sielaff, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia, Civil Action No. 85-0655-R).  \n \n●  1989 – General Assembly:  The public defender system was expanded to include \ncoverage of Page County and create offices in Suffolk, Danville, Bedford, City of \nFranklin, and Counties of Isle of Wight and Southampton.  The expansion was due to \nlocal initiatives not recommendations of the subcommittee.  \n \n●  1989 – General Assembly:  House Joint Resolution No. 279.  Upon \nrecommendation of the subcommittee, the General Assembly authorized the Department \nof Planning and Budget to conduct a multi-agency study of the cost and policy \nimplications of further expansion of the public defender system and modifications in the \ncourt-appointed counsel and public defender systems.  \n \n●  1989 - General Assembly:  The General Assembly enacts a 15% increase in \nmaximum allowable fees to court appointed counsel. \n \n●  1990 – General Assembly:  The General Assembly approved funding for 50 \nadditional positions in the public defender system, but because of budgetary constraints, \nin 1991 the positions were still not filled.  Upon recommendation of the subcommittee, \nthe General Assembly also removed the requirement that public defenders assist the \ncourts in indigency screening and authorized a $40 per diem compensation for Public \nDefender Commission members. \n \n●  1990 – General Assembly:  The subcommittee studying indigent defense \nrecommended:  \n• a 20 % increase in fees for juvenile court cases.  House Bill No. 211 was \ncarried-over by the House Appropriations Committee for consideration in the \n1991 session, but due to fiscal concerns it was not likely to pass.   \n• a 20 % increase in the maximum fees in criminal cases.  House Bill No. 212 was \ncarried over by the House Appropriations Committee \n \n●  1994 – General Assembly:  Senate Joint Resolution No. 186 was adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly, requesting the Committee on District Courts (CDC) study court \nappointed counsel fees in juvenile and domestic relations courts, inherent problems in the \ncurrent system, and alternative methods for providing adequate representation at a \nreasonable cost.  Later that year, at the request of the General Assembly, the study is \nexpanded to include all case types. \n  11\n\n \n●  1996 – General Assembly:  House Joint Resolution No. 79, directing the Virginia \nState Crime Commission to study the cost-effectiveness of public defender offices versus \ncourt-appointed counsel and the level of court-appointed counsel fees.  In support of the \nneed for the study, the resolution finds that “although the entire criminal justice system is \nsuffering from a lack of adequate resources, the current level of funding for indigent \ndefense has reached a crisis level” \n \n●  1999 – Special Committee on Court-Appointed Fees:  Following the 1998 session \nof the General Assembly, the Chief Justice appointed the Special Committee as part of an \neffort to address the issue of Virginia having the lowest court-appointed counsel fees in \nthe nation.  As a result of the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Supreme \nCourt budget requested a 20% increase in misdemeanor caps, from $100 to $120 in \ndistrict court and $132 to $158 in circuit court.  It was also requested that support be \ngiven for inclusion of language in the Budget Act which would require the administration \nto address the fees issue in the preparation of the next biennium budget.  The Judicial \nCouncil and the Crime Commission supported the proposal, but the efforts failed when \nthe bill (HB 1660) was voted down. \n \n●  1999 – Special Committee on Court-Appointed Fees.  For the next session of the \nGeneral Assembly, the Special Committee proposed fee cap increases of 20% in \nmisdemeanors (as previously requested), and 40% in Class II-VI felonies (from $318 to \n$445 and $882 to $1235) which would, at most, raise Virginia’s rates to the third lowest \nin the nation (not considering Mississippi’s reimbursement for expenses).  The Special \nCommittee requested and received information from The Spangenberg Group regarding \ncourt-appointed fees across the nation.  The proposal was endorsed by the Judicial \nCouncil, the Virginia Bar Association, and the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, and \nwas submitted as part of the proposed Supreme Court budget for the FY 2000-2002 \nbudgetary cycle.  The Governor did not support the proposal.  What passed was a 24% \nincrease in all non-capital felony and misdemeanor cases for the second half of the \nbiennium (beginning 7/1/01). \n \n●  2000 – General Assembly:  House Joint Resolution No. 178, directing the \nVirginia State Crime Commission to study existing methods for providing indigent \ndefense, covering quality of representation, efficiency of service, and cost effectiveness.  \nIt was resolved that quality of representation should include the impact of public defender \nworkloads and cost effectiveness should include the impact of the current fees on the \nquality of indigent defense.  \n \n●  2002 – General Assembly:  Senate Joint Resolution 43 and House Joint \nResolution 94 requested the Virginia State Crime Commission to study the potential use \nof an indigent defense commission to improve the quality and efficiency of Virginia’s \nindigent defense services.  Under the resolutions, the Crime Commission is to create an \nindigent defense study committee to consider the establishment of a statewide \ncommission and whether such a commission should have any of the following \nresponsibilities:  to determine the appropriate mechanism for delivering indigent defense \n  12\n\nservices within a given jurisdiction; to set training and other quality control standards for \nindigent defense counsel; to fund and provide specialized training for indigent defense \ncounsel; to set standards for court-appointed attorneys; to set caseload standards; and to \noversee Virginia’s expenditure of funds paid to private indigent defense counsel and to \nexpert witnesses.  Findings and recommendations are to be reported to the Governor and \nthe 2004 Session of the General Assembly. \n \n \nIII.  Other Action \n \n●  1964 – Governor:  The Governor commissioned a study to examine the need for a \npublic defender system and to generally review indigent defense services in Virginia.  A \npublic defender system was recommended but not implemented. \n \n●  1980 - Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia (OES):  \nOES asked The Spangenberg Group to provide specific information on various aspects of \nindigent defense systems in other states \n \n●  1983 – State Bar:  A letter to the Governor was sent laying out the developing \ncrisis in indigent defense in Virginia.  Reference is made to: \n  • The refusal of attorneys to accept court-appointments \n• A corresponding difficulty of the courts in finding competent counsel to handle \nmore complex indigent cases \n• Meritorious claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are felt to be on the rise \nfor reasons beyond the normal increase in cases being tried \n• A concern for the potential for litigation by parties who feel that the schedule of \nmaximum fees is inadequate \n \n●  1984 – OES:  Court-Appointed Counsel Procedures and Guidelines Manual \n \n●  1986-1987 – Virginia Bar Association:  The Defense of Indigents in Virginia \nrecommends that court-appointed fees be increased, beginning with a 15% increase. \n \n●   1989 – Virginia Bar Association:  With encouragement from the subcommittee \nstudying alternative indigent defense systems, the Virginia Bar Association (VBA) \nexplored the feasibility of creating a capital resource center.   President of VBA testified \nbefore the subcommittee that such as center is needed to ensure competent representation \nand to educate those handling capital cases in order to improve quality of representation.  \nVBA applied for and received temporary funding from the Virginia Law Foundation, \ncontingent upon federal funding, for a capital resource center with three or four full-time \nattorneys and at least one investigator.   \n \n●  1993 - Commission on Youth:  The Commission on Youth studies the \nappointment of GAL in juvenile cases and recommends establishment of specific \nstandards and training for lawyers who represent children in certain cases. \n \n  13\n\n●  1997-1998 – Virginia State Bar:  Ad Hoc Committee on Court-Appointed \nCounsel Fees steps up efforts before the legislature for fee increases.  The Bar’s efforts \nare supported by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and \nby information supplied by The Spangenberg Group.  A modest proposal was developed \nto raise misdemeanor fees from $130 to $172, felonies up to Class III from $265 to $345, \nand Class II felonies (20 years to life) to $1,500.  The Crime Commission, the Committee \non District Courts, and the Judicial Counsel, endorsed the proposal.  The 1998 General \nAssembly passed more modest increases.  Fees in Class III to Class VI felonies were \nraised to $305, in Class II felonies from $735 to $845, and in the second year of the \nbiennium the same fees were raised by another 5%, to $318 and $882 respectively.  \nDuring the legislative process, Co-Chair of the Senate Finance Committee commented \nthat this was an issue he knew would need to be addressed in coming years, and other \nlegislators suggested that the Bar plan to return to address the issue in the future.\n  14\n\nAppendix B: Tally of Interviewees by Judicial District and Type of Position \n23rd & \n24th:  27th & 29th: \n4th & 7th:  Roanoke/  26th & 31st:  Russell/ \nNorfolk &  10th:   15th:  Roanoke  Rockingham  Tazewell &  Total in \nNewport  Halifax &  13th:  Spotsylvania  18th:  19th:  City &  & Prince  Pulaski/  Each \n   News  Mecklenburg  Richmond  & Hanover  Alexandria  Fairfax  Lynchburg  William  Montgomery  Category \nCircuit Court Judges  6  3  5  1  1  2  3  1  3  25 \nGeneral District \nCourt Judges  3  1  3  2  1  2  9  7  2  30 \nJuvenile Judges  6  2  5  0  2  2  2  1  3  23 \nClerks   6  6  5  1  4  6  6  7  8  49 \nCourt Appointed \nAttorneys  21  4  10  11  7  9  21  11  18  112 \nChief Public \nDefenders  1  1  1  0  1  1  2  1  1  9 \nAssistant Public \nDefenders  7  5  9  5  10  8  8  3  1  56 \nCommonwealth’s \nAttorneys  1  1  1  2  1  1  1  1  3  12 \nAssistant \nCommonwealth’s \nAttorneys  1  0  0  0  0  2  3  0  1  7 \nAppellate Public \nDefenders  0  0  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  3 \nCapital Public \nDefenders  0  0  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  2 \nOther  5  1  7  1  10  9  5  2  2  42 \nTotal in Each Circuit  57  24  51  23  37  42  60  34  42  370 \n“Clerks” includes Assistant and Deputy Clerks                 \n“Other” includes Public Defender support staff, court support staff, probation officers, sheriffs, etc.   \nThere were 27 court observations conducted and 5 jails visited.             \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix C \nABA Letters to Site Work Interviewees \n \n\n                                 \n \n \n \n           \n              AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION \nStanding Committee on \nLegal Aid and Indigent  \nDefendants  \n \n        321 N.
