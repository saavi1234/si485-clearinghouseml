It is one of a number of cases across the country seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the federal government on a similar theory. Plaintiffs claimed their free exercise of religion and freedom of speech rights were violated by the portion of the interim final regulations adopted to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (\"the ACA\"), that would require them to cover contraception as part of their health insurance offerings.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2012, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing, among other things, that the regulations were in the process of being amended; that no part of the law had been enforced against any of Plaintiffs; and that Plaintiffs lacked standing.</p>\r\n<p>On July 17, 2012, in a 45-page opinion, the Court, (Senior Judge Warren K. Urbom) granted the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 2012, Plaintiffs appealed the decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the appeal on August 21, 2013.</p>",

No. 111-148, 124 Stat. \n119 (2010),1 and implementing regulations, require all group health plans and health insurance \nissuers that offer non-grandfathered group or individual health coverage to provide coverage for \ncertain recommended preventive services without cost-sharing (such as a copayment, \ncoinsurance, or a deductible).2  As relevant here, except as to group health plans of certain \nreligious employers (and group health insurance coverage sold in connection with those plans), \nthe preventive services that must be covered include all Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-\napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling \nfor women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider.  Plaintiffs – seven \nStates, three non-profit organizations, and two individuals – brought suit on February 23, 2012, \nseeking to have the Court declare the preventive services coverage regulations invalid and enjoin \ntheir implementation.  Plaintiffs claim the regulations violate their rights to free speech, free \nexercise of religion, and freedom of association protected by the First Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”).   \nOver the past few months, defendants have issued guidance on a temporary enforcement \nsafe harbor and initiated a rulemaking to further amend the preventive services coverage \nregulations to address religious concerns such as those raised by plaintiffs in this case.  The \nenforcement safe harbor provides that defendants will not bring any enforcement action against \nnon-profit organizations with religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage (and \n                                                 \n1 Amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. \n111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010). \n \n2 A grandfathered plan is one that was in existence on March 23, 2010 and that has not \nundergone any of a defined set of changes.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n1251; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140.   \n1 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 10 of 45 - Page ID # 101\nassociated plans and issuers) if they meet certain criteria.  The safe harbor protects such \norganizations until the first health plan year that begins on or after August 1, 2013.  Moreover, \ndefendants published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (“ANPRM”) in the Federal \nRegister that confirms defendants’ intent, before the expiration of the safe harbor period, to \npropose and finalize amendments to the preventive services coverage regulations to further \naccommodate non-exempt, non-grandfathered religious organizations’ religious objections to \ncovering contraceptive services.  The ANPRM suggests ideas and solicits public comment on \npotential accommodations, including, but not limited to, requiring health insurance issuers to \noffer health insurance coverage without contraceptive coverage to religious organizations that \nobject to such coverage and simultaneously to offer contraceptive coverage directly to such \norganizations’ plan participants, at no charge.   \nIn light of these actions, this Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs’ claims.  As \nan initial matter, the organization plaintiffs have not alleged any imminent injury from the \noperation of the regulations.  The organization plaintiffs sponsor group health plans for their \nemployees, but they have not made factual allegations that establish that those plans – which \naccording to the complaint do not cover contraceptive services – are ineligible for grandfather \nstatus.  Thus, the organization plaintiffs have not shown that they are under any current \nobligation to offer coverage for contraceptive services.  Moreover, even assuming the \norganization plaintiffs’ group health plans are not grandfathered, the organization plaintiffs \nappear to qualify for the temporary enforcement safe harbor, and, indeed, they do not allege \notherwise.  Pursuant to the safe harbor, defendants will not take any enforcement action against \nthe organization plaintiffs until at least August 1, 2013, by which time defendants will have \n2 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 11 of 45 - Page ID # 102\nfinalized amendments to the challenged regulations to accommodate the religious objections of \norganizations like the organization plaintiffs.    \nThe individual plaintiffs – who are employed by religious organizations and obtain their \nhealth coverage through those organizations – lack standing for similar reasons.  The individual \nplaintiffs currently have health coverage that does not cover contraception, and the allegations in \nthe complaint do not establish that they will be unable to maintain that coverage for the \nforeseeable future either because their plans are not grandfathered or because their employers \nwill not qualify for the temporary enforcement safe harbor.  Further, when the safe harbor \nexpires, the individual plaintiffs may well be able to continue receiving – through their religious \norganization employers – health coverage that does not cover contraceptive services in light of \nthe rulemaking that defendants have initiated.  The individual plaintiffs’ speculation to the \ncontrary – which relies on possible future events and potential future decisions made by parties \nthat are not before this Court (e.g., the individual plaintiff’s employers) – cannot establish \nstanding. \nThe State plaintiffs also lack standing – both now and after the challenged regulations are \nfinalized.  It is well-established that a state cannot bring a parens patriae action on behalf of its \ncitizens against federal defendants.  See, e.g., Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485-86 \n(1923).  It is, after all, “the United States, and not the state, which represents [its citizens] as \nparens patriae.”  Id. at 486.  In addition, the State plaintiffs have not established standing to \nbring this action on their own behalf.  The alleged threat to the States’ budgetary stability as a \nresult of increased enrollment in the States’ Medicaid programs is too speculative, remote, and \nindirect to support standing.  It rests on hypotheticals about what independent actors may do in \nthe future.  The Eighth Circuit has rejected similar allegations of injury to a state, see Iowa ex \n3 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 12 of 45 - Page ID # 103\nrel. Miller v. Block, 771 F.2d 347, 353-54 (8th Cir. 1985), and this Court should do the same \nhere.  Nor are the States the intended beneficiaries of the provisions on which their claims are \nbased, as required by prudential principles of standing and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).  The First Amendment and RFRA protect persons, not states.  Indeed, states are not \nallowed to establish, much less exercise, religious beliefs. \nLastly, the Court lacks jurisdiction because plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe.  Plaintiffs’ \nchallenge to the preventive services coverage regulations is not fit for judicial review because \ndefendants have initiated a rulemaking to amend the challenged regulations to further \naccommodate religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage.  In the meantime, the \ntemporary enforcement safe harbor will be in effect and plaintiffs will not suffer any hardship \nfrom the regulations they seek to challenge. \nBACKGROUND \n \nPrior to the enactment of the ACA, many Americans did not receive the preventive health \ncare they needed to stay healthy, avoid or delay the onset of disease, lead productive lives, and \nreduce health care costs.  Due in large part to cost, Americans used preventive services at about \nhalf the recommended rate.  See INST. OF MED., CLINICAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR WOMEN: \nCLOSING THE GAPS 19-20, 109 (2011) (“IOM REP.”).  Section 1001 of the ACA – which includes \nthe preventive services coverage provision that is relevant here – seeks to cure this problem by \nmaking recommended preventive care affordable and accessible for many more Americans. \nThe preventive services coverage provision requires all group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers that offer non-grandfathered group or individual health coverage to provide \n4 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 13 of 45 - Page ID # 104\ncoverage for certain preventive services without cost-sharing.3  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.  The \npreventive services that must be covered are: (1) evidence-based items or services that have in \neffect a rating of “A” or “B” from the United States Preventive Services Task Force \n(“USPSTF”); (2) immunizations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices; (3) for infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed preventive care and \nscreenings provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (“HRSA”)4; and (4) for women, such additional preventive care and \nscreenings not described by the USPSTF as provided in comprehensive guidelines supported by \nHRSA.  Id.     \nThe requirement to provide coverage for recommended preventive services for women, \nwithout cost-sharing, was added as an amendment to the ACA during the legislative process.  \nThe Women’s Health Amendment was intended to fill significant gaps relating to women’s \nhealth that existed in the other preventive care guidelines identified in section 1001 of the ACA.  \nSee 155 Cong. Rec. S12019, S12025 (daily ed. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Boxer) (“The \nunderlying bill introduced by Senator Reid already requires that preventive services \nrecommended by [USPSTF] be covered at little to no cost . . . .  But [those recommendations] do \nnot include certain recommendations that many women’s health advocates and medical \nprofessionals believe are critically important . . . .”); 155 Cong. Rec. S12261, S12271 (daily ed. \nDec. 3, 2009) (statement of Sen. Franken) (“The current bill relies solely on [USPSTF] to \n                                                 \n3 A group health plan includes a plan established or maintained by an employer that \nprovides medical care to employees.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).  Group health plans may be \ninsured (i.e., medical care underwritten through an insurance contract) or self-insured (i.e., \nmedical care funded directly by the employer).  The ACA does not require employers to provide \nhealth coverage for their employees, but, beginning in 2014, certain large employers may face \nassessable payments if they fail to do so under certain circumstances.  26 U.S.C. § 4980H. \n  \n4 HRSA is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. \n5 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 14 of 45 - Page ID # 105\ndetermine which services will be covered at no cost.  The problem is, several crucial women’s \nhealth services are omitted.  [The Women’s Health Amendment] closes this gap.”). \nResearch shows that cost-sharing requirements can pose barriers to preventive care and \nresult in reduced use of preventive services, particularly for women.  IOM REP. at 109; 155 \nCong. Rec. at S12026-27 (daily ed. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“We want to \neither eliminate or shrink those deductibles and eliminate that high barrier, that overwhelming \nhurdle that prevents women from having access to [preventive care].”).  Indeed, a 2010 survey \nshowed that less than half of women are up to date with recommended preventive care \nscreenings and services.  IOM REP. at 19.  By requiring coverage for recommended preventive \nservices and eliminating cost-sharing requirements, Congress sought to increase access to and \nutilization of recommended preventive services.  75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41728 (July 19, 2010).  \nIncreased use of preventive services will benefit the health of individual Americans and society \nat large: individuals will experience improved health as a result of reduced transmission, \nprevention or delayed onset, and earlier treatment of disease; healthier workers will be more \nproductive with fewer sick days; and increased utilization will result in savings due to lower \nhealth care costs.  75 Fed. Reg. at 41728, 41733; IOM REP. at 20.      \nDefendants issued interim final regulations implementing the preventive services \ncoverage provision on July 19, 2010.  75 Fed. Reg. 41726.  The interim final regulations provide, \namong other things, that a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering non-\ngrandfathered health coverage must provide coverage for newly recommended preventive \nservices, without cost-sharing, for plan years (or, in the individual market, policy years) that \nbegin on or after the date that is one year after the date on which the new recommendation is \n6 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 15 of 45 - Page ID # 106\nissued.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713T(b)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(b)(1); 45 C.F.R. § \n147.130(b)(1).   \nBecause there were no existing HRSA guidelines relating to preventive care and \nscreening for women, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) tasked the \nInstitute of Medicine (“IOM”)5 with “reviewing what preventive services are necessary for \nwomen’s health and well-being” and developing recommendations for comprehensive \nguidelines.  IOM REP. at 2.  IOM conducted an extensive science-based review and, on July 19, \n2011, published a report of its analysis and recommendations.  Id. at 20-26.  The report \nrecommended that HRSA guidelines include, among other things, well-woman visits, \nbreastfeeding support, domestic violence screening, and, as relevant here, “the full range of \n[FDA]-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and \ncounseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  Id. at 10-12.  FDA-approved \ncontraceptive methods include diaphragms, oral contraceptive pills, emergency contraceptives \n(such as Plan B and Ella), and intrauterine devices.  FDA, Birth Control Guide, available at \nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/ucm118465.htm (last visited Apr. 5, \n2012).   \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted IOM’s recommendations in full, subject to an \nexemption relating to certain religious employers authorized by an amendment to the interim \nfinal regulations.  See HRSA Guidelines, available at http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ \n(last visited Apr. 5, 2012).  The amendment to the interim final regulations, issued on the same \nday, authorized HRSA to exempt group health plans sponsored by certain religious employers \n                                                 \n5 IOM was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences and is funded by \nCongress.

Id.   \n7 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 16 of 45 - Page ID # 107\n(and associated group health insurance coverage) from any requirement to cover contraceptive \nservices under HRSA’s guidelines.  76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (Aug. 3, 2011); 45 C.F.R. § \n147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A).  To qualify for the exemption, an employer must meet all of the following \ncriteria: \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization. \n \n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization. \n \n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization. \n \n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) and \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n \n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B).  The sections of the Internal Revenue Code referenced in the \nfourth criterion refer to “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of \nchurches,” as well as “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order,” that are exempt \nfrom taxation under 26 U.S.C. § 501(a).  26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(1), (a)(3)(A)(i), (a)(3)(A)(iii).  \nThus, as relevant here, the amended interim final regulations required non-grandfathered plans \nthat do not qualify for the religious employer exemption to provide coverage for recommended \ncontraceptive services, without cost-sharing, for plan years (or, in the individual market, policy \nyears) beginning on or after August 1, 2012.       \n  Defendants requested comments on the amended interim final regulations and \nspecifically on the definition of religious employer contained in those regulations.  76 Fed. Reg. \nat 46623.  After carefully considering the more than 200,000 comments they received, \ndefendants decided to adopt in final regulations the definition of religious employer contained in \nthe amended interim final regulations while also creating a temporary enforcement safe harbor \nfor plans sponsored by certain non-profit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive \n8 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 17 of 45 - Page ID # 108\ncoverage that do not qualify for the religious employer exemption.  77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8727 \n(Feb. 15, 2012).   \nPursuant to the temporary enforcement safe harbor, defendants will not take any \nenforcement action against an employer, group health plan, or group health insurance issuer with \nrespect to a non-exempt, non-grandfathered group health plan that fails to cover some or all \nrecommended contraceptive services and that is sponsored by an organization that meets all of \nthe following criteria: \n(1) The organization is organized and operates as a non-profit entity. \n \n(2) From February 10, 2012 onward, contraceptive coverage has not been provided at any \npoint by the group health plan sponsored by the organization, consistent with any \napplicable state law, because of the religious beliefs of the organization. \n \n(3) The group health plan sponsored by the organization (or another entity on behalf of \nthe plan, such as a health insurance issuer or third-party administrator) provides to \nplan participants a prescribed notice indicating that the plan will not provide \ncontraceptive coverage for the first plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2012. \n \n(4) The organization self-certifies that it satisfies the three criteria above, and documents \nits self-certification in accordance with prescribed procedures.6   \n \nThe enforcement safe harbor will be in effect until the first plan year that begins on or after \nAugust 1, 2013.  Guidance at 3.  By that time, defendants expect that significant changes to the \npreventive services coverage regulations will have altered the landscape with respect to religious \naccommodations under the regulations by providing further relief to certain religious \norganizations.   \n  Those intended changes, which were first announced when defendants finalized the \nreligious employer exemption, will establish alternative means of providing contraceptive \n                                                 \n6 HHS, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor (“Guidance”), at 3 (Feb. \n10, 2012), available at http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-\nPreventive-Services-Bulletin.pdf (last visited Apr. 5, 2012); 75 Fed.

Reg. at \n8728.   Defendants began the process of amending the regulations on March 21, 2012, when they \npublished an ANPRM in the Federal Register.  77 Fed. Reg. 16501 (Mar. 21, 2012).  The \nANPRM “presents questions and ideas” on potential means of achieving the goals of providing \nwomen access to contraceptive services without cost-sharing and accommodating religious \norganizations’ liberty interests.  Id. at 16503.  The purpose of the ANPRM is to provide “an early \nopportunity for any interested stakeholder to provide advice and input into the policy \ndevelopment relating to the accommodation to be made” in the forthcoming amendments to the \nregulations.  Id.  Among other options, the ANPRM suggests requiring health insurance issuers \nto offer health insurance coverage without contraceptive coverage to religious organizations that \nobject to such coverage on religious grounds and simultaneously to offer contraceptive coverage \ndirectly to the organization’s plan participants, at no charge.  Id. at 16505.  The ANPRM also \nsuggests ideas and solicits comments on potential ways to accommodate religious organizations \nthat sponsor self-insured group health plans for their employees.  Id. at 16506-07.   \nAfter receiving comments on the ANPRM, defendants will publish a notice of proposed \nrulemaking, which will be subject to further public comment before defendants issue further \namendments to the preventive services coverage regulations.  Id. at 16501.  Defendants intend to \nfinalize the amendments to the regulations such that they are effective by the end of the \ntemporary enforcement safe harbor.  Id. at 16503. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nDefendants move to dismiss this case in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The party invoking federal \n10 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 19 of 45 - Page ID # 110\njurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, \n523 U.S. 83, 104 (1998); Wilkinson v. United States, 440 F.3d 970, 977 (8th Cir. 2006).  Where, \nas here, defendants challenge jurisdiction on the face of the complaint, the complaint must plead \nsufficient facts to establish that jurisdiction exists.  This Court must determine whether it has \nsubject matter jurisdiction before addressing the merits of the complaint.  See Steel Co., 523 U.S. \nat 94-95. \nDefendants also move to dismiss the State plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 12(b)(6) for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Under this Rule, “the tenet that a court \nmust accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal \nconclusions.  Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \nconclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THIS CASE FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION \nBECAUSE PLAINTIFFS LACK STANDING \n \n“[S]tanding is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of  \nArticle III [of the Constitution],” and it is fundamental to the court’s jurisdiction to hear a case.  \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The “irreducible constitutional \nminimum of standing” requires a plaintiff to demonstrate (1) it has suffered an injury in fact; (2) \nthe existence of a causal connection between the alleged injury and conduct that is fairly \ntraceable to the defendant; and (3) it is likely the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.  \nId. at 560–61.   \nAn injury in fact is “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Id. at 560 \n(quotations omitted).  The harm must be “direct and palpable.”  Carson v. Pierce, 719 F.2d 931, \n11 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 20 of 45 - Page ID # 111\n934 (8th Cir. 1983).  Allegations of possible future injury do not suffice; rather, “[a] threatened \ninjury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.”  Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. \n149, 158 (1990) (quotation omitted).  A plaintiff that “alleges only an injury at some indefinite \nfuture time” has not shown an injury in fact, particularly where “the acts necessary to make the \ninjury happen are at least partly within the plaintiff’s own control.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2.  \nIn these situations, “the injury [must] proceed with a high degree of immediacy, so as to reduce \nthe possibility of deciding a case in which no injury would have occurred at all.”  Id. \n  A.  The Organization Plaintiffs Lack Standing \n \nThere are three organization plaintiffs.  Catholic Social Services describes itself as a non-\nprofit corporation affiliated with the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska, that provides “faith-\nbased charity services” to persons in southern Nebraska.  Compl. ¶¶ 34-35.  It states that it has \n“more than 50 persons on staff.”  Id. ¶ 36.  Pius X Catholic High School describes itself as a non-\nprofit corporation with more than 70 faculty and staff and the “sole Catholic high school” for the \nCity of Lincoln, Nebraska.  Id. ¶¶ 44-45.  The Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America states \nthat it is “a non-profit religious 501(c)(3) organization with its principle place of business located \nin Omaha, Nebraska.”  Id. ¶ 51.  The organization plaintiffs allege that they currently make \navailable to their employees group health plans that do not cover contraception.  Id. ¶¶ 39, 41, \n47, 49, 52, 56.  They further allege that “[h]ealth insurance coverage of services for purposes of \ncontraception, abortifacients, or sterilization is in contravention with Catholic teaching and \ndoctrine adhered to and followed by [the organization plaintiffs].”  Id. ¶ 40; accord id. ¶¶ 48, 57.  \nCatholic Social Services and The Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America assert that they do \nnot qualify for the religious employer exemption because the inculcation of religious values is \n12 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 21 of 45 - Page ID # 112\nnot their primary purpose and they employ or serve persons who do not share their religious \ntenets.  Id. ¶¶ 37-38, 53, 55.         \n  These allegations do not establish standing because they fail to demonstrate a concrete \nand imminent injury resulting from the operation of the preventive services coverage regulations.  \nFirst, the organization plaintiffs have not made sufficient factual allegations to show that the \ngroup health plans they offer to their employees are not eligible for grandfather status.  The \npreventive services coverage regulations do not apply to grandfathered plans.  42 U.S.C. § \n18011(a)(2); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140.  A \ngrandfathered plan is a health plan in which at least one individual was enrolled on March 23, \n2010 and that has continuously covered at least one individual since that date.  42 U.S.C. § \n18011(a)(2); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a), (g)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a), (g)(1); 45 \nC.F.R. § 147.140(a), (g)(1).  A grandfathered plan may lose its grandfather status if, compared to \nits existence on March 23, 2010, it eliminates all or substantially all benefits to diagnose or treat \na particular condition, increases a percentage cost-sharing requirement, significantly increases a \nfixed-amount cost-sharing requirement, significantly reduces the employer’s contribution, or \nimposes or tightens an annual limit on the dollar value of any benefits.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n1251T(a), (g)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a), (g)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a), (g)(1).   \n  The Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America concedes that its group health plan is \ngrandfathered.

Catholic Social Services and Pius X Catholic High School assert \nthat their group health plans are not grandfathered, id. ¶¶ 43, 50, but they do not allege any facts \nto support this legal conclusion.  See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (observing that “naked assertion[s] \ndevoid of further factual enhancement” are insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss \n(quotations omitted)); Walker v. Barrett, 650 F.3d 1198, 1209 (8th Cir. 2011) (“[L]egal \n13 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 22 of 45 - Page ID # 113\nconclusions, without any supporting factual allegations, are insufficient to survive a motion to \ndismiss.”); United States v. Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d 829, 834 (8th Cir. 2009) (“[A] \nplaintiff must clearly allege facts showing an injury in fact[.]”).  Catholic Social Services and \nPius X Catholic High School do not allege that their group health plans were not in place on \nMarch 23, 2010, or that their plans have not continuously covered at least one individual since \nthat date, or that they have altered their plans in a way that would cause them to lose grandfather \nstatus.  Nor do they allege that they will alter their health plans in such a way in the imminent \nfuture.  Plaintiffs do contend that the loss of grandfather status “in the foreseeable future” is \n“inevitabl[e].”  Compl. ¶ 89.  But none of the organization plaintiffs alleges specific plans to \nalter their health plan in a substantial way.  “[A]ssumed future intent,” County of Mille Lacs v. \nBenjamin, 361 F.3d 460, 464 (8th Cir. 2004), and “‘some day’ intentions – without any \ndescription of concrete plans,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 – do not establish an injury in fact.  See \nalso id. at 564 n.2 (allegations of injury “at some indefinite future time” do not establish an \ninjury in fact, particularly where “the acts necessary to make the injury happen are at least partly \nwithin the plaintiff’s own control”).  Accordingly, the allegations in the complaint simply do not \nshow that the organization plaintiffs will be required by the preventive services coverage \nregulations to provide coverage for contraceptive services – as opposed to continuing to offer a \ngrandfathered plan that does not, and presumably would not, cover contraceptive services.7   \nSecond, even if the organization plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that their group health \nplans are not grandfathered, they still would not have alleged an injury in fact.  Under the \nenforcement safe harbor, defendants will not take any enforcement action against an organization \n                                                 \n7 Unlike the other two organization plaintiffs, Pius X Catholic High School does not \nallege that it is ineligible for the religious employer exemption.  For this additional reason, Pius \nX Catholic High School has not alleged an injury resulting from the challenged regulations. \n14 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 23 of 45 - Page ID # 114\nthat qualifies for the safe harbor until the first plan year that begins on or after August 1, 2013.  \nGuidance at 3.  The organization plaintiffs make no effort to show that they will not be protected \nby the enforcement safe harbor.  Indeed, the organization plaintiffs’ own description of \nthemselves – as non-profit organizations that do not provide contraception coverage in their \ngroup health plans (Compl. ¶¶ 34, 41, 44, 49, 51, 56) – strongly suggests that they do qualify for \nthe enforcement safe harbor.  See Guidance at 3.  Thus, the earliest the organization plaintiffs \ncould be subject to any enforcement action by defendants for failing to provide contraceptive \ncoverage is August 1, 2013.  With such a long time before the inception of any possible injury \nand the challenged regulations undergoing amendment before then, the organization plaintiffs \ncannot satisfy the imminence requirement for standing; the asserted injury is simply “too remote \ntemporally.”  See McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 226 (2003) (concluding Senator lacked \nstanding based on claimed desire to air advertisements five years in the future), overruled in part \non other grounds, Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010); Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 159-60.   \nThis defect in the organization plaintiffs’ suit does not implicate a mere technical issue of \ncounting intermediate days.  Nor does it rest on the truism that a final regulation is always \nsubject to change by the agency that promulgated it; the ANPRM goes much further than that by \npromising imminent regulatory amendments.  Thus, the defect in plaintiff’s case goes to the \nfundamental limitations on the role of federal courts.  The “underlying purpose of the imminence \nrequirement is to ensure that the court in which suit is brought does not render an advisory \nopinion in ‘a case in which no injury would have occurred at all.’”  Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. \nv. Espy, 23 F.3d 496, 500 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2).  The ANPRM \npublished in the Federal Register confirms, and seeks comment on, defendants’ intention to \npropose further amendments to the preventive services coverage regulations that will \n15 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 24 of 45 - Page ID # 115\naccommodate the concerns of religious organizations that object to providing contraceptive \ncoverage for religious reasons, like the organization plaintiffs.  77 Fed. Reg. at 16501.  The \nANPRM provides plaintiffs, and any other interested party, with the opportunity to, among other \nthings, comment on ideas suggested by defendants for accommodating religious organizations, \noffer new ideas to “enable religious organizations to avoid . . . objectionable cooperation when it \ncomes to the funding of contraceptive coverage,” and identify considerations defendants should \ntake into account when amending the regulations.  Id. at 16503, 16507.  Defendants, moreover, \nhave indicated that they intend to finalize the amendments to the regulations before the rolling \nexpiration of the temporary enforcement safe harbor starting on August 1, 2013.  Id. at 16503; \nsee also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728.  In light of the forthcoming amendments, and the opportunity the \nrulemaking process provides for plaintiffs to help shape those amendments, there is no reason to \nsuspect that the organization plaintiffs will be required to sponsor a health plan that covers \ncontraceptive services in contravention of their religious beliefs once the enforcement safe \nharbor expires.  At the very least, given the anticipated changes to the preventive services \ncoverage regulations, the organization plaintiffs’ claim of injury after the temporary enforcement \nsafe harbor expires, if any, would differ substantially from their current claim of injury.  And, \ngiven the existing enforcement safe harbor, there is no basis for this Court to consider the merits \nof plaintiffs’ complaint at this juncture.8 \n                                                 \n8 Plaintiffs maintain that nothing prevents defendants from “unilaterally withdrawing” the \ntemporary enforcement safe harbor at any time and thus there is no guarantee that the \norganization plaintiffs will be protected from enforcement action by defendants until August 1, \n2013.  Compl. ¶ 73.  Speculation that the defendants will take back the promised safe harbor – \nwhich was issued as formal guidance by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, see \nGuidance, and has been repeatedly referenced in the Federal Register, see, e.g., 77 Fed. Reg. \n8725, 8728 (Feb. 15, 2012); 77 Fed. Reg. at 16502-03 – is not only dubious, it is also insufficient \nto establish an injury.  Indeed, the Eighth Circuit rejected an argument similar to the one \nplaintiffs make here in Boyle v. Anderson, 68 F.3d 1093, 1100 (8th Cir. 1995).  In that case, the \n16 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 25 of 45 - Page ID # 116\nAccordingly, the Court should dismiss the organization plaintiffs’ claims for lack of \nstanding.  \n  B.  The Individual Plaintiffs Lack Standing \n \n  The two individual plaintiffs – who are employed by religious organizations and obtain \ntheir health coverage through those organizations – lack standing for reasons similar to those set \nforth above with respect to the organization plaintiffs.   \nSister Mary Catherine describes herself as a “Catholic nun affiliated with the School \nSisters of Christ the King.”  Compl. ¶ 16.  She states that she is currently covered by a non-\ngrandfathered health plan, which does not cover contraception, through the Catholic Diocese of \nLincoln, Nebraska.  Id. ¶¶ 17, 19, 21.  Stacy Molai describes herself as a “missionary employed \nby the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (“FOCUS”), a Catholic organization engaged \nin ministry and outreach on college campuses.”  Id. ¶ 23.  She states that she is currently covered \nby a grandfathered health plan, which does not cover contraception, through her employer, \nFOCUS.  Id. ¶¶ 24, 26, 31.  Both Sister Mary Catherine and Stacy Molai allege that health \ninsurance coverage for contraception is in contravention of their religious beliefs, id. ¶¶ 18, 25, \nand that they will drop such coverage if retaining it would result in the “subsidization” of \ncontraception, id. ¶¶ 20, 30.  Neither of the individual plaintiffs, however, allege that they pay \nany portion of the premium for their health coverage or that they will be required to do so in the \nfuture.  Stacy Molai further alleges that she suffers from an incurable chronic illness that requires \nsubstantial ongoing medical care.  Id. ¶¶ 27-29.       \n                                                                                                                                                             \nplaintiff sought to challenge state law reporting requirements that did not apply to it based on the \nsupposition that the state “might at some point in the future change its position and require \ncompliance with the data requirements.”  Id.  The court, however, refused to issue “an advisory \nopinion to deal with the possibility that at some point in the future the State” might “reverse [its] \nposition.”  Id.  “[C]onjectur[e] about “possible future injury,” the court explained, “does not meet \nthe requirements for an injury in fact.”  Id.   \n17 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 26 of 45 - Page ID # 117\nThe individual plaintiffs’ claims are premised on a possible future world in which the \nindividual plaintiffs will not be able to obtain health coverage without contraception coverage.  \nBut the individual plaintiffs currently have health coverage that does not cover contraception, \nand the allegations in the complaint do not show that they will be unable to maintain such \ncoverage for the foreseeable future or that they will somehow be required to “subsidize” \ncontraception coverage.  Further, any potential injury to the individual plaintiffs would be \nattributable to the currently unknown actions of the individual plaintiff’s employers.  And those \nemployers are not before the Court.  Thus, the individual plaintiffs have not alleged an imminent \nand concrete injury that is fairly traceable to the preventive services coverage regulations.   \nFirst, the individual plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that their current health plans, \nwhich do not cover contraception, are not grandfathered and thus excluded from the requirement \nto cover contraceptive services.  Indeed, Stacey Molai admits that her health plan is \ngrandfathered.  Compl. ¶ 31.  She speculates that her employer could change the health plan in \nthe future in a way that would cause it to lose grandfather status, id. ¶ 32, but such generalized \nconjecture about possible future events – particularly events that hinge on the independent \nactions of parties not before this Court – cannot establish standing.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, \n564; Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 158; County of Mille Lacs, 361 F.3d at 464.  Sister Mary Catherine \nalleges that her health insurance plan is not grandfathered, Compl. ¶ 21, but she does not provide \nany of the necessary factual allegations to support this legal conclusion.9  See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at \n1949; Walker, 650 F.3d at 1209; Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d at 834.  The individual \nplaintiffs, therefore, simply have not shown that the health plans under which they are currently \n                                                 \n9 In addition, neither Sister Mary Catherine nor Stacy Molai has alleged that her \nemployer is ineligible for the religious employer exemption.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv). \n \n18 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 27 of 45 - Page ID # 118\ncovered will be required to cover contraception as a result of the preventive services coverage \nregulations.   \n  Second, even if the individual plaintiffs’ health plans were not grandfathered, the \nindividual plaintiffs still would not have made sufficient allegations to establish standing.  The \nindividual plaintiffs make no effort to show that their employers will not be protected by the \ntemporary enforcement safe harbor, such that their employers can continue to offer a health plan \nthat does not cover contraception without fear of an enforcement action by defendants until at \nleast August 1, 2013.  Indeed, the individual plaintiffs’ description of their employers, see \nCompl. ¶¶ 16, 17, 19, 23, 26, strongly suggests that the employers do qualify for the enforcement \nsafe harbor.  See Guidance at 3.  There is, therefore, no reason to suspect that the individual \nplaintiffs will be unable to maintain – through their religious organization employers – health \ncoverage that does not cover contraceptive services until at least August 1, 2013.10   \nMoreover, by that time, defendants will have finalized amendments to the preventive \nservices coverage regulations that will accommodate additional religious organizations’ religious \nobjections to providing contraception coverage.  Those amendments are likely to affect the \nindividual plaintiffs as well, by providing them with a mechanism – through their religious \norganization employers – to obtain health coverage that does not cover contraception.  See 77 \nFed. Reg. at 16505 (suggesting, among other options, that amendments might require health \ninsurance issuers to offer health insurance coverage without contraceptive coverage to religious \norganizations that object to such coverage on religious grounds).  And any suggestion that the \nindividual plaintiffs will be unable to obtain such coverage through their employer after the \n                                                 \n10 Any decision by the individual plaintiffs’ employers to forego the benefit of the \ntemporary enforcement safe harbor is not only speculative at this point but also would not \nestablish an injury fairly traceable to the challenged regulations.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n19 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 28 of 45 - Page ID # 119\nenforcement safe harbor expires is entirely speculative at this point.  At the very least, given the \nanticipated amendments, the individual plaintiffs’ claim of injury after the temporary \nenforcement safe harbor expires, if any, would differ substantially from their current claim of \ninjury.  See Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d at 835-837; Johnson v. Missouri, 142 F.3d \n1087, 1089-90 (8th Cir. 1998) (rejecting standing where “a number of things [had to] occur \nbefore [plaintiffs would] suffer an actual or even an imminent injury” and, at the time the suit \nwas brought, “the timing and type of injury to the [plaintiffs could not] be determined”).  \nBecause the individual plaintiffs’ allegations of injury rest on possible future events and \ndecisions independent actors not before the Court may make in the future, the individual \nplaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for lack of standing. \n  C.  The State Plaintiffs Lack Standing11  \n \n  The States appear to pursue two theories of standing.  First, they seek to bring a parens \npatriae action on behalf of their citizens to protect their citizens’ rights under the First \nAmendment and RFRA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 9-15, 77.  Second, the States purport to sue on their own \nbehalf, alleging their budgetary stability will be adversely affected if more citizens enroll in \nMedicaid as a result of religious organizations dropping health coverage for their employees or \nreligious charities ceasing to serve persons who do not share their religious beliefs.  Id. ¶¶ 85-87.  \nNeither theory satisfies the States’ burden to demonstrate standing.  \n \n \n                                                 \n11 The Court should address the State plaintiffs’ standing even if it determines that one or \nmore of the organization or individual plaintiffs have standing.  See Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Block, \n771 F.2d 347, 354-55 (8th Cir. 1985) (dismissing State for lack of standing even though \ndefendant did not challenge standing of individual plaintiff); see also Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. \n737, 752 (1984) (Article III standing limitations are designed “to ascertain whether the particular \nplaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted” (emphasis added)).  \n20 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 29 of 45 - Page ID # 120\n1.  The States Cannot Bring a Parens Patriae Action  \nThe doctrine of parens patriae permits a state to sue to vindicate the interests of its \ncitizens in some instances.  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. \n592, 601 (1982).  The Supreme Court, however, made clear more than 80 years ago that a state \ncannot bring a parens patriae action against federal defendants.  See Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 U.S. at 485-86.  In dismissing an action brought by Massachusetts to exempt its citizens \nfrom a federal statute designed to “protect the health of mothers and infants,” the Court \nexplained that the citizens of a state “are also citizens of the United States,” and therefore “[i]t \ncannot be conceded that a state, as parens patriae, may institute judicial proceedings to protect \ncitizens of the United States from the operation of the statutes thereof.”  Id. at 478, 485.  The \nCourt stressed that “it is no part of [a state’s] duty or power to enforce [its citizens’] rights in \nrespect of their relations with the federal government;” “it is the United States, and not the state, \nwhich represents [its citizens] as parens patriae.”  Id. at 485-86.   \nThe Supreme Court has consistently applied this principle since Mellon to dismiss actions \nbrought by a state as parens patriae against federal defendants.  See Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S. \n12,18 (1927) (relying on Mellon to dismiss Florida’s challenge to a federal inheritance tax based \non alleged injury to its citizens); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 324 (1966) \n(concluding South Carolina lacked standing as parens patriae to invoke the Due Process Clause \nor the Bill of Attainder Clause against the federal government); see also Snapp, 458 U.S. at 610 \nn.16 (“A State does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal \nGovernment.”); Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 n.17 (2007) (observing that Mellon \n“prohibits” allowing a state “‘to protect her citizens from the operation of federal statutes’”).  \nAnd lower courts – including the Eighth Circuit – have done the same.  See Iowa ex rel. Miller, \n21 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 30 of 45 - Page ID # 121\n771 F.2d at 354-55 (concluding Iowa lacked standing as parens patriae to sue federal \ndefendants; “[to] allow the State to proceed as parens patriae” against federal defendants “would \nintrude on the sovereignty of the federal government and ignore important considerations of our \nfederalist system”); see also Virginia. ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 271 (4th Cir. \n2011); Wyoming ex rel. Sullivan v. Lujan, 969 F.2d 877, 883 (10th Cir. 1992); Pennsylvania v. \nKleppe, 533 F.2d 668, 676-77 (D.C. Cir. 1976); People ex. rel. Hartigan v. Cheney, 726 F. Supp. \n219, 222-23 (C.D. Ill. 1989).  \nBecause a state cannot bring a parens patriae suit against federal defendants, the State \nplaintiffs cannot pursue this action under a parens patriae theory.        \n2.  The States Cannot Sue On Their Own Behalf  \n \na.  The States Have Not Alleged an Imminent, Actual, and \nConcrete Injury to Their Own Interests \n \nIn some circumstances, a state may have standing to challenge federal action that \nthreatens its own distinct interests.  As with any other party, however, the harm to the state’s \ninterests must be “an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is “concrete and particularized” \nand “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  A state \nsuffers a cognizable injury when, for example, its physical territory such as its “coastal land” is \nharmed.  See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 522-23.  A state likewise may challenge a \nmeasure commanding the state itself to act, see New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992) \n(standing to challenge federal law requiring State to take title to nuclear waste or enact federally-\napproved regulations), or that prohibits it from acting, see Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 \n(1970) (standing to challenge federal law barring literacy-test or durational-residency \nrequirements in elections and requiring State to enfranchise 18-year-olds).   \n22 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 31 of 45 - Page ID # 122\nThe State plaintiffs’ allegations of harm to their own interests in this case are a far cry \nfrom the actual or imminent injuries alleged in the cases cited above.  The States allege that, if \nreligious organizations were to stop providing health coverage to their employees, those \nemployees would enroll in the States’ Medicaid programs.  Compl. ¶ 85.  They also assert that \nreligious organizations would stop providing charitable services to persons who do not share the \norganizations’ religious beliefs in an effort to qualify for the religious employer exemption and, \nas a result, the individuals previously served by these organizations would turn to the States’ \nMedicaid programs.  Id. ¶ 87.  The States claim this predicted increase in the number of \nindividuals enrolled in their Medicaid programs would threaten the States’ “budgetary stability.”  \nId. ¶¶ 86-87.   \nThese allegations amount to no more than “conjecture based on speculation that is \nbottomed on surmise,” and, thus, they do not establish standing.  Wyoming ex rel. Sullivan, 969 \nF.2d at 882.  Indeed, the Eighth Circuit rejected similar allegations of injury to a state in Iowa ex \nrel. Miller.  771 F.2d 347.  In that case, Iowa sued to compel the Secretary of Agriculture to \nimplement various federal agricultural disaster relief programs following a drought in the State.  \nId. at 348.  Like the State plaintiffs here, Iowa alleged that the Secretary’s failure to implement \nthe programs would adversely affect the State’s financial resources by imposing “increased \nresponsibility for the welfare and support of [] affected citizens” on the State while also causing \na decrease in the State’s tax revenues.  Id. at 353.  Iowa relied on speculative inferences – not \nunlike the leaps of logic the State plaintiffs make here – to contrive this speculative harm.  Iowa \nasserted that, without the federal disaster relief programs, agriculture production in the State \nwould decline and agriculturally-based industries would move out of State.  Id.  These \noccurrences, Iowa concluded, would “forc[e] unemployment up and state tax revenues down.”  \n23 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 32 of 45 - Page ID # 123\nId.  The Eighth Circuit rejected these allegations of injury, concluding they were far too \nspeculative, remote, and indirect to support standing.  Id. at 354.  See also Florida, 273 U.S. at \n17-18 (rejecting standing notwithstanding Florida’s allegation that challenged federal law would \ninduce citizens to remove property from the State thereby diminishing the State’s tax revenues); \nPeople ex. rel. Hartigan, 726 F. Supp. at 223 (concluding Illinois lacked standing despite claim \nthat challenged federal law would require “increased spending by the state on such programs as \nunemployment compensation benefits and public assistance”).  This Court should reach the same \nresult here. \nAs an initial matter, in light of the forthcoming amendments to the regulations that are \nintended to further accommodate religious objections to providing contraception coverage, it \nwould be speculative to suggest that religious organizations will stop providing health coverage \nto their employees because of the preventive services coverage regulations.  Indeed, the State \nplaintiffs do not even go so far as to make such a claim.  Their allegation instead is framed as a \n“what if.”  Compl. ¶ 85 (“If religious organization employers were to cease provision of health \ninsurance . . . .” (emphasis added)).  Such speculation about possible future events cannot \nconstitute an injury in fact.  Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 158; Metro. St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d at \n835-837 (concluding association did not have standing to intervene in lawsuit because alleged \ninjury – an increase in sewer rates – depended on a number of contingencies and thus constituted \nmere speculation); Nolles v. State Comm. for Reorganization of Sch. Dists., 524 F.3d 892, 901 \n(8th Cir. 2008) (no standing where “claimed injury” was “the potential for increased property \ntaxes without a hearing”). \nThe State plaintiffs’ allegation regarding the potential future decisions of religious \ncharities to cease serving certain individuals is similarly theoretical.  Conjecture about decisions \n24 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 33 of 45 - Page ID # 124\nindependent actors may make in the future is insufficient to support standing.  See County of \nMille Lacs, 361 F.3d at 464 (observing that “speculative harms based upon the assumed future \nintent” do not establish an injury in fact).12 \nFurthermore, even if the States’ hypotheticals were to come to pass someday, it is simply \nwrong to suggest – as the States appear to do – that the employees and beneficiaries of these \nreligious organizations would “invariably” enroll in Medicaid.  Compl. ¶ 85.  The eligibility \nrequirements for individuals that a state’s Medicaid program must cover – if the state elects to \nparticipate in Medicaid – are based on an individual’s income and physical condition, not \nwhether the individual has health insurance coverage.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i).  \nThus, an individual who is not otherwise eligible for Medicaid does not become eligible merely \nbecause she is no longer receiving health insurance through her employer.13  Because the States’ \nallegations of injury to their “budgetary stability,” Compl. ¶86, appears to be based on the false \npremise that individuals not otherwise eligible for Medicaid will become eligible for, and in fact \nenroll in, Medicaid if religious organizations stop providing health coverage or charitable \nservices (which is itself a highly speculative proposition), the States have not alleged a \n                                                 \n12 The State plaintiffs’ alleged injury also is not fairly traceable to the preventive services \ncoverage regulations.  It is based on the States’ predictions about the future decisions of \nemployers, charitable organizations, and individuals – decisions that will no doubt be based on \nfactors other than the existence of the preventive services coverage regulations.  See Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 562 (observing that standing is “substantially more difficult to establish” where the \nalleged injury “depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the \ncourt[] and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the court[] cannot presume either \nto control or to predict” (quotation omitted)).   \n \n13 Conversely, an individual who is eligible for Medicaid remains eligible even if she is \nprovided health coverage through her employer.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396e(c)(2) (“The fact that an \nindividual is enrolled in a group health plan under this section shall not change the individual's \neligibility for benefits under the State plan, except insofar as section 1396a(a)(25) of this title \nprovides that payment for such benefits shall first be made by such plan.”).   \n \n25 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 34 of 45 - Page ID # 125\ncognizable injury.14  In sum, the States’ allegations of possible second-order ricochet effects on \ntheir budgetary stability fail to establish standing.  \nb.  The States’ Alleged Injury Does Not Fall Within the Zone of \nInterests to be Protected by the First Amendment or RFRA   \n \nIn addition to the constitutional requirements for standing set forth in Lujan, courts also \nadhere to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.  Valley Forge \nChristian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474 \n(1982).  These prudential principles were developed by the judiciary to “avoid deciding \nquestions of broad social import where no individual rights would be vindicated and to limit \naccess to the federal courts to those litigants best suited to assert a particular claim.”  Gladstone \nRealtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99-100 (1979).  One such principle requires that \nthe plaintiff’s complaint fall within “the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the \nstatute or constitutional guarantee in question.”  Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. \nv. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970).  “[W]here the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the \ncontested regulatory action, the [zone-of-interest] test denies a right of review if the plaintiff’s \ninterests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes of the statute [or \nconstitutional provision] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress [or the Framers] \nintended to permit the suit.”  Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399-400 (1987). \n                                                 \n14 Even if the States did not have this apparent false premise problem, they still would \nlack standing.  State participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but, once states choose \nto participate, they must offer benefits to certain individuals as a condition of participation.  It is \ndifficult to see how a State can claim injury on the ground that its citizens will choose to accept \nbenefits the State has chosen to offer them under state law.  See Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 \nU.S. 660, 664 (1976) (concluding States that enacted tax credits for individuals’ taxes paid to \nother States did not have standing to sue other States for damages, because the “injuries to the \nplaintiffs’ fiscs were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by their respective state \nlegislatures”).   \n26 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 35 of 45 - Page ID # 126\nThe necessary link between the State plaintiffs and the provisions on which their claims \nrely – the First Amendment and RFRA – is absent here.  The First Amendment and RFRA are \nintended to protect individuals, not states.  See Rasul v. Myers, 563 F.3d 527, 532-33 (D.C. Cir. \n2009); Parker v. District of Columbia, 478 F.3d 370, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  The provisions, \nmoreover, are designed to ensure religious liberty, not state solvency.  The States’ asserted \ninterest in their budgetary stability simply does not fall within these zones of interest.  See South \nDakota v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 665 F.3d 986, 990-91 (8th Cir. 2012) (concluding that South \nDakota lacked prudential standing to challenge, under the Due Process Clause, a decision by the \nSecretary of the Interior to accept parcels of land within the State into trust for the benefit of an \nIndian tribe because the Due Process Clause protects individuals, not states); DKT Mem’l Fund \nv. Agency for Int’l Dev., 887 F.2d 275, 283-85 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (finding under a zone-of-\ninterests analysis that foreign non-governmental organizations did not have standing to challenge \nfederal government policy as a violation of the First Amendment because the First Amendment \naffords no protection to aliens beyond the borders of the United States).  Accordingly, the State \nplaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for the additional reason that the States lack prudential \nstanding. \n  D.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Ripe \n \nEven if the Court determines that one or more plaintiffs has standing, the Court \nnevertheless should dismiss this action because plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe.  “The ripeness \ndoctrine is drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons \nfor refusing to exercise jurisdiction.”  Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. Dep’t of the Interior, 538 \nU.S. 803, 808 (2003) (quotation omitted).  It “prevent[s] the courts, through avoidance of \npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over \n27 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 36 of 45 - Page ID # 127\nadministrative policies.”  Id. at 807.  It also “protect[s] the agencies from judicial interference \nuntil an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the \nchallenging parties.”  Id. at 807-08.   \nA case ripe for judicial review cannot be “nebulous or contingent but must have taken on \nfixed and final shape so that a court can see what legal issues it is deciding, what effect its \ndecision will have on the adversaries, and some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them.”  \nPublic Serv. Comm’n v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 244 (1952).  In assessing ripeness, courts \nevaluate both “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of \nwithholding court consideration.”  Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), overruled \non other grounds in Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977).   \nThe Supreme Court discussed these two prongs of the ripeness analysis in Abbott \nLaboratories, the seminal case on pre-enforcement review of agency action.  387 U.S. 136.  \nAbbott Laboratories involved a pre-enforcement challenge to Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \nAct regulations that required drug manufacturers to include a drug’s established name every time \nthe drug’s proprietary name appeared on a label.  Id. at 137-38.  The regulations required the \nplaintiff drug manufacturers to change all their labels, advertisements, and promotional materials \nat considerable burden and expense.  Id. at 152.  Noncompliance would have triggered \nsignificant civil and criminal penalties.  Id. at 153 & n.19.   \nThe Court determined the regulations were fit for judicial review because they were \n“quite clearly definitive,” id. at 151; the regulations “were made effective immediately upon \npublication,” id. at 152, and “[t]here [was] no hint that th[e] regulation[s] [were] informal . . . or \ntentative.”  Id. at 151.  Moreover, the Court noted that “the issue tendered [was] a purely legal \none” and there was no indication that “further administrative proceedings [were] contemplated.”  \n28 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 37 of 45 - Page ID # 128\nId. at 149.  The Court therefore was not concerned that judicial intervention would \ninappropriately interfere with further administrative action.     \nWith respect to the hardship prong, the Court determined that delayed review would \ncause sufficient hardship to the plaintiffs.  The impact of the regulations, the Court noted, was \n“sufficiently direct and immediate” because their promulgation put the drug manufacturers in a \n“dilemma” – “[e]ither they must comply with the every time requirement and incur the costs of \nchanging over their promotional material and labeling” or they must “risk serious criminal and \ncivil penalties for the unlawful distribution of misbranded drugs.”  Id. at 152-53 (quotation \nomitted).  In other words, the challenged regulations “require[d] an immediate and significant \nchange in the plaintiffs’ conduct of their affairs with serious penalties attached to \nnoncompliance.”  Id. at 153. \nNone of the indicia of ripeness discussed in Abbott Laboratories is present in this case.  \nDefendants have initiated a rulemaking to amend the challenged regulations to accommodate the \nconcerns expressed by plaintiffs and others that are similarly situated.  Defendants, moreover, \nhave made clear that the forthcoming amendments will be finalized well before the earliest date \non which the challenged regulations could be enforced by defendants against certain non-profit \norganizations with religious objections to covering contraception – like the organization \nplaintiffs and the employers of the individual plaintiffs.  77 Fed. Reg. at 8728-29.  Therefore, \nunlike in Abbott Laboratories – where the challenged regulations were definitive and no further \nadministrative proceedings were contemplated – the regulations challenged here will be \namended. \nFurthermore, the forthcoming amendments are intended to address the very issue that \nplaintiffs raise in this case by establishing alternative means of providing contraceptive coverage \n29 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 38 of 45 - Page ID # 129\nwithout cost-sharing while accommodating religious organizations’ religious objections to \ncovering contraceptive services.  And plaintiffs will have several opportunities to participate in \nthe rulemaking process and to provide comments and/or ideas regarding the proposed \naccommodations.  There is, therefore, a significant chance that the amendments will alleviate \naltogether the need for judicial review, or at least narrow and refine the scope of any actual \ncontroversy to more manageable proportions.  See Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 \n(1998) (“A claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not \noccur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” (quotations omitted)).  Once the \nforthcoming amendments are finalized, if plaintiffs’ concerns are not laid to rest, plaintiffs “will \nhave ample opportunity [] to bring [their] legal challenge at a time when harm is more imminent \nand more certain.”  Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 734 (1998); see also Texas \nIndep. Producers & Royalty Owners Ass’n v. EPA, 413 F.3d 479, 483-84 (5th Cir. 2005) \n(dismissing challenge to rule as unripe where agency deferred effective date of rule and \nannounced its intent to consider issues raised by plaintiff in new rulemaking during the deferral \nperiod); Wyoming Outdoor Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(“Prudence . . . restrains courts from hastily intervening into matters that may best be reviewed at \nanother time or another setting, especially when the uncertain nature of an issue might affect a \ncourt’s ability to decide intelligently.” (quotation omitted)); Lake Pilots Ass’n v. U.S. Coast \nGuard, 257 F. Supp. 2d 148, 160-162 (D.D.C. 2003) (holding challenge to rule was not ripe \nwhere agency undertook a new rulemaking to address issue raised by plaintiff in the lawsuit).   \nAdditionally, although plaintiffs’ complaint raises largely legal claims, those claims are \nleveled at regulations that, as related to the plaintiffs (and similarly-situated organizations and \nindividuals), have not “taken on fixed and final shape.”  Vorbeck v. Schnicker, 660 F.2d 1260, \n30 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 39 of 45 - Page ID # 130\n1266 (8th Cir. 1981).  Once defendants complete the rulemaking outlined in the ANPRM, \nplaintiffs’ challenge to the current regulations likely will be moot.  See The Toca Producers v. \nFERC, 411 F.3d 262, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (rejecting purely legal claim as unripe due to the \npossibility that it may not need to be resolved by the courts).  And judicial review now of any \nfuture amendments to the regulations that result from the pending rulemaking would be too \nspeculative to yield meaningful review.  The ANPRM offers ideas and solicits input on potential \nmeans of achieving the goals of providing women access to contraceptive services without cost-\nsharing and accommodating religious organizations’ religious liberty interests.  77 Fed. Reg. at \n16503.  It does not preordain what amendments to the preventive services coverage regulations \ndefendants will ultimately promulgate; nor does it foreclose the possibility that defendants will \nadopt alternative proposals not set out in the ANPRM.  Thus, review of any of the suggested \nproposals contained in the ANPRM would only entangle the Court “in abstract disagreements \nover administrative policies.”  Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 148; see also Minnesota Pub. Utils. \nComm’n. v. FCC, 483 F.3d 570, 582-83 (8th Cir. 2007) (concluding agency order that suggested \nagency would preempt certain state regulations in the future “if faced with the precise issue” was \nnot ripe because “the order [did] not purport to actually do so and until that day comes it is only a \nmere prediction”); Texas Indep. Producers, 413 F.3d at 484; Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. New \nYork State Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation, 79 F.3d 1298, 1306 (2d Cir. 1996) (concluding claims \nwere not ripe where “plaintiffs’ arguments depend upon the effects of regulatory choices to be \nmade by [state] in the future”); Lake Pilots Ass’n, 257 F. Supp. 2d at 162.  Because judicial \nreview at this time would inappropriately interfere with defendants’ pending rulemaking and \nmay result in the Court deciding issues that may never arise, this case is not fit for judicial \nreview. \n31 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 40 of 45 - Page ID # 131\nWithholding or delaying judicial review also would not result in any hardship for \nplaintiffs.  Unlike the plaintiffs in Abbott Laboratories, plaintiffs here are not being compelled to \nmake immediate and significant changes in their day-to-day operations under threat of serious \ncivil and criminal penalties.  As explained above, if the group health plans made available by the \norganization plaintiffs or by the employers of the individual plaintiffs are grandfathered – and \nthere are no factual allegations in the complaint to indicate that they are not – then the plans are \nnot required to cover contraceptive services.  Moreover, even if the group health plans are not \ngrandfathered, the organization plaintiffs and the employers of the individual plaintiffs can \nqualify for the temporary enforcement safe harbor, meaning defendants will not take any \nenforcement action against them for failure to cover contraceptive services until August 1, 2013, \nat the earliest.  See Guidance at 3.  And, by that time, defendants will have finalized amendments \nto the preventive services coverage regulations to further accommodate religious objections to \nproviding contraceptive coverage.  See 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728-29.  Therefore, this is simply not a \ncase where plaintiffs are forced to choose between foregoing lawful activity and risking \nsubstantial legal sanctions.  See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 153; see also Texas Indep. Producers, \n413 F.3d at 483 (finding no hardship where effective date of rule was one year away and agency \nhad announced its intention to initiate a new rulemaking to address plaintiff’s concerns).  Indeed, \n“[w]ere [this Court] to entertain [the] anticipatory challenge[] pressed by [plaintiffs]” – parties \n“facing no imminent threat of adverse agency action, no hard choice between compliance certain \nto be disadvantageous and a high probability of strong sanctions” – the Court “would venture \naway from the domain of judicial review into a realm more accurately described as judicial \npreview,” a realm into which courts should not tread.  Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 736 \nF.2d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (internal citation omitted); see also Missouri ex rel. Mo.  \n32 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 41 of 45 - Page ID # 132\nHighway &Transp. Comm’n v. Cuffley, 112 F.3d 1332, 1337 (8th  Cir. 1997) (“[Courts] may not \nrender an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” (quotation \nomitted)). \nBecause plaintiffs’ challenge to the preventive services coverage regulations is not fit for \njudicial decision and plaintiffs would not suffer substantial hardship if judicial review were \nwithheld or delayed, this case should be dismissed in its entirety as unripe.   \nII.  THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE STATE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS FOR \nFAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF MAY BE GRANTED \n \n  Even if the Court were to determine that it has jurisdiction over the claims asserted by the \nState plaintiffs on their own behalf, the Court nonetheless should dismiss those claims under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The States claim that the preventive services coverage \nregulations violate the States’ rights to free speech, free exercise of religion, and freedom of \nassociation under the First Amendment as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  But \nneither the First Amendment nor RFRA provides any protection to states.  Therefore, the State \nplaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.     \nThe First Amendment “exists to protect individuals, not government.”  Forbes v. \nArkansas Educ. Television Comm’n, 93 F.3d 497, 505 (8th Cir. 1996), rev’d on other grounds, \n523 U.S. 666 (1998), and subsequently vacated, 145 F.3d 1017 (8th Cir. 1998); see also Parker, \n478 F.3d at 383 (“Every other provision of the Bill of Rights, excepting the Tenth, which speaks \nexplicitly about the allocation of governmental power, protects rights enjoyed by citizens in their \nindividual capacity.”); Warner Cable Commc’ns, Inc. v. City of Niceville, 911 F.2d 634, 638 \n(11th Cir. 1990) (observing that the Free Speech Clause does not protect the government).  Cf. \nLyons v. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. 552, 560 (2011) (“[F]undamental rights protected by the \nfederal Bill of Rights . . . apply only to individual persons, not to the federal government.”); \n33 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 42 of 45 - Page ID # 133\nEEOC v. Mitsubishi Motor Mfg. of Am., Inc., 102 F.3d 869, 871 (7th Cir. 1996) (“The Executive \nBranch of the federal government does not have rights under the [F]irst [A]mendment.”).  The \nsame is true of RFRA.  RFRA prohibits the “government [from] substantially burden[ing] a \nperson’s exercise of religion” unless the government demonstrates that it is the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1 (emphasis \nadded).  Congress enacted RFRA with the express aim of restoring what, in Congress’s view, the \nFree Exercise Clause of the Constitution guaranteed prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in \nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990).  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb.  Accordingly, the \n“persons” to whom RFRA applies should be interpreted to be consistent with the reach of the \nFirst Amendment.  See Rasul, 563 F.3d at 532-33.  Because the First Amendment does not \nprotect states, neither does RFRA.15  \n  Indeed, it would be absurd to suggest that states have rights under the Free Exercise \nClause and RFRA.  Those provisions prohibit the government from imposing a substantial \nburden on a person’s exercise of religion (whether via a non-neutral, non-generally-applicable \nlaw or otherwise) absent a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring.  42 U.S.C. § \n2000bb-1; Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993).  \nStates, however, are prohibited from advancing, endorsing, or exercising any religion by another \n                                                 \n15 The term “person” as used in RFRA does not include states for the additional reason \nthat Congress included states within the definition of “government” under RFRA.  RFRA \nprohibits certain actions by “government” – a term that, prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in \nCity of Boerne v. Flores, included states.  521 U.S. 507, 516 (1997) (citing prior version of 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000bb-2(1) that defined “government” to include any “State”).  It would be \ninconsistent with principles of statutory construction to interpret “person” as used in RFRA to \ninclude states when Congress used a different term in the same provision, i.e., “government,” to \nrefer to states.  See Furnes v. Reeves, 362 F.3d 702, 713 (11th Cir. 2004) (“It is a fundamental \nrule of statutory interpretation that, within an act, the same words have the same meanings and \ndifferent words have different meanings.”); Lindsey v. Tacoma-Pierce Cnty. Health Dep’t, 195 \nF.3d 1065, 1074 (9th Cir. 1999) (recognizing “basic principle of statutory construction that \ndifferent words in the same statute must be given different meanings”).  \n34 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 43 of 45 - Page ID # 134\nconstitutional provision – the Establishment Clause.  See Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431 \n(1962) (“When the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a \nparticular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to \nthe prevailing officially approved religion is plain.”); Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. \n296, 303 (1940).  Thus, the State plaintiffs cannot show that their exercise of religion has been \nsubstantially burdened – as required by the First Amendment and RFRA – without purporting to \nendorse a religion – which would violate the Establishment Clause.  For these reasons, if the \nCourt determines it has jurisdiction over the claims that the State plaintiffs assert on their own \nbehalf, the Court should dismiss those claims under Rule 12(b)(6).   \nCONCLUSION \n  For all the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant defendants’ motion to dismiss. \n     \n   \n35 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 31   Filed: 04/30/12   Page 44 of 45 - Page ID # 135\nRespectfully submitted this 30th day of April, 2012, \n      STUART  F.

Now before me is the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nand 12(b)(6).  (See Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 30).  For the following reasons, the defendants’\nmotion will be granted.  \nI.     BACKGROUND\nA.     The Parties\nThe plaintiffs Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, Ohio, and Oklahoma are sovereign\nstates in the United States of America.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 9-10, 12-15, ECF No. 1.)  The plaintiff\nSchuette appears in this action for the people of Michigan.  (See id. ¶ 11.)  Collectively, these seven\nplaintiffs will be referred to as “the State plaintiffs.”  \nThe plaintiff Sister Mary Catherine is a Catholic nun affiliated with the School Sisters of\nChrist the King, which is a Catholic Order located in Lincoln, Nebraska.  (Compl. ¶ 16, ECF No. 1.)\nThe plaintiff Molai is a Catholic individual residing in Omaha, Nebraska, and a missionary employed\nby the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS), which is “a Catholic organization\nengaged in ministry and outreach on college campuses throughout the United States and around the\nworld.”  (Id. ¶¶ 22-23.)  Collectively, these two plaintiffs will be referred to as “the individual\nplaintiffs.”\n2\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 3 of 45 - Page ID # 206\nThe plaintiff Catholic Social Services is “a Nebraska non-profit corporation,” “a faith-based\ncharity services provider,” and “a Catholic religious organization employer.”  (Compl. ¶ 34, ECF No.\n1.)  It “is an affiliated entity of the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska[,] providing social charity\nto persons in southern Nebraska.”  (Id. ¶ 35.)  The plaintiff Pius X “is a Nebraska non-profit\ncorporation and is the sole Catholic high school for the City of Lincoln and the Diocese of Lincoln,\nNebraska.”  (Id. ¶ 44.)  The plaintiff Catholic Mutual “is a non-profit religious 501(c)(3) organization\nwith its princip[al] place of business located in Omaha, Nebraska.”  (Id. ¶ 51.)  Collectively, these\nthree plaintiffs will be referred to as “the organizational plaintiffs.”  \nThe defendants HHS, Treasury, and DOL (collectively, “the Departments”) are agencies of\nthe United States, and as noted previously, the defendants Sebelius, Geithner, and Solis are sued in\ntheir official capacities as the secretaries of those agencies.  (Compl. ¶¶ 63-68, ECF No. 1.)  \nB.     The Relevant Statutes and Regulations\nThe plaintiffs allege that certain “final rules” that were adopted by the defendants in order\nto implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119\n(2010), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-\n152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA), will “coerce” religious\nindividuals, “organizations, institutions, care providers, outreach groups, and social service agencies,\namong others, to directly subsidize contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services\nin contravention [of] their religious beliefs.”  (Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 1; see also id. ¶ 69.)  They add\nthat “Plaintiff States’ budgetary stability” will be threatened if “religious organization employers\n3\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 4 of 45 - Page ID # 207\nwere to cease [to provide] health insurance in order to avoid the requirements of the Rule.”  (Id. ¶¶\n85-86.)  A review of the relevant statutes, regulations, and rules is in order.\nSection 1001 of the ACA added section 2713 to the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.  In pertinent part, PHS Act section 2713, which is titled “coverage of\npreventive health services,” states, \n(a) In general\nA group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health\ninsurance coverage shall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose\nany cost sharing requirements for--\n(1) evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of “A” or “B”\nin the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task\nForce; [and]\n. . . . \n(4) with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings not\ndescribed in paragraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive guidelines\nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for purposes\nof this paragraph.  \n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(1), (4). \nOn July 19, 2010, the Departments issued interim final regulations implementing section\n2713.  See Interim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to\nCoverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 75 Fed. Reg.\n41726 (July 19, 2010).  The interim final regulations state that when new recommendations or\nguidelines for preventive health services are issued, coverage for those services “must be provided\nfor plan years (in the individual market, policy years) beginning . . . one year after the date the\nrecommendation or guideline is issued.”  75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41729.  They also state, “The\nrequirements to cover recommended preventive services without any cost-sharing requirements do\n4\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 5 of 45 - Page ID # 208\nnot apply to grandfathered health plans.”  Id. (citing 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R.\n2590.715-1251; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140).  Grandfathered health plans are defined as plans “in which\nan individual was enrolled on March 23, 2010,” and which are able to comply with certain\nregulations.  See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R. 2590.715-1251; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140.\nOn August 1, 2011, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) adopted\nrecommendations for preventive services for women that include certain services related to\ncontraception.    (See  Defs.’  Br.  at  7,  ECF  No.  31  (citing  HRSA  Guidelines,  available  at\nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/).)  The Departments then published amendments to the\ninterim final regulations that took effect on that same date (i.e., August 1, 2011).  See Group Health\nPlans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (Aug. 3, 2011).  The amendments to the\ninterim final regulations  note,\n[The interim final regulations state that], to the extent not described in the\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, HRSA was charged with\ndeveloping comprehensive guidelines for preventive care and screenings with respect\nto women . . . .  The interim final regulations also require that changes in the required\nitems and services be implemented no later than plan years (in the individual market,\npolicy years) beginning on or after the date that is one year from when the new\nrecommendation or guideline is issued.\nIn response to the request for comments on the interim final regulations, the\nDepartments received considerable feedback regarding which preventive services for\nwomen should be considered for coverage under PHS Act section 2713(a)(4).  Most\ncommenters, including some religious organizations, recommended that HRSA\nGuidelines include contraceptive services for all women and that this requirement be\nbinding on all group health plans and health insurance issuers with no religious\nexemption.  However, several commenters asserted that requiring group health plans\nsponsored by religious employers to cover contraceptive services that their faith\ndeems contrary to its religious tenets would impinge upon their religious freedom.\nOne commenter noted that some religious employers do not currently cover such\nbenefits under their group health plan due to their religious beliefs.\n5\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 6 of 45 - Page ID # 209\n. . . These HRSA Guidelines exist solely to bind non-grandfathered group\nhealth plans and health insurance issuers with respect to the extent of their coverage\nof certain preventive services for women.  In the Departments’ view, it is appropriate\nthat HRSA, in issuing these Guidelines, takes into account the effect on the religious\nbeliefs of certain religious employers if coverage of contraceptive services were\nrequired in the group health plans in which employees in certain religious positions\nparticipate.    Specifically,  the  Departments  seek  to  provide  for  a  religious\naccommodation that respects the unique relationship between a house of worship and\nits employees in ministerial positions. . . . \nIn light of the above, the Departments are amending the interim final rules to\nprovide HRSA additional discretion to exempt certain religious employers from the\nGuidelines where contraceptive services are concerned.  The amendment to the\ninterim final rules provides HRSA with the discretion to establish this exemption.\nConsistent with most States that have such exemptions, as described below, the\namended regulations specify that, for purposes of this policy, a religious employer\nis one that: (1) Has the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily\nemploys persons who share its religious tenets; (3) primarily serves persons who\nshare its religious tenets; and (4) is a non-profit organization under section 6033(a)(1)\nand section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code.  Section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii)\nrefer to churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of\nchurches, as well as to the exclusively religious activities of any religious order. . .\n. \n76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46623.  See also 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv).  (See also Compl. ¶ 78, ECF\nNo. 1 (describing the scope of the religious employer exemption).)  In short, the amended interim\nfinal regulations require non-grandfathered plans that do not fall within the exemption for “religious\nemployers”1 to provide coverage for the contraceptive services recommended by HRSA “for plan\nyears (in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after the date that is one year from\n1 I note in passing that although the amended interim final regulations state merely that\nthey grant HRSA discretion to exempt “religious employers” from the guidelines regarding\ncontraceptive services, later rules indicate that HRSA did, in fact, exercise this discretion in the\nguidelines published on August 1, 2011.  See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers\nRelating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct, 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726 (Feb. 15, 2012) (“In the HRSA Guidelines, HRSA exercised its\ndiscretion under the amended interim final regulations such that group health plans established\nand maintained by these religious employers (and any group health insurance coverage provided\nin connection with such plans) are not required to cover contraceptive services.”).  \n6\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 7 of 45 - Page ID # 210\nwhen the new [contraceptive services] recommendation or guideline [was] issued,” i.e.,  August 1,\n2012.  \nOn February 15, 2012, the Departments published rules that “finalize[d], without change,”\nthe amended interim final regulations discussed above.  Group Health Plans and Health Insurance\nIssuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012).  In their complaint, the plaintiffs refer to these rules\nas “the Rule” (e.g., Compl. ¶ 69, ECF No. 1); I shall do so as well.2  The Rule states,\nSection 2713 of the PHS Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act[,] . . .\nrequires that non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers\noffering group or individual health insurance coverage provide benefits for certain\npreventive health services without the imposition of cost sharing.  These preventive\nhealth services include, with respect to women, preventive care and screening\nprovided for in the comprehensive guidelines supported by [HRSA] that were issued\non August 1, 2011 (HRSA Guidelines).  As relevant here, the HRSA Guidelines\nrequire coverage, without cost sharing, for “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . .\n. approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and\ncounseling for all women with reproductive capacity,” as prescribed by a provider.\nExcept  as  discussed  below,  non-grandfathered  group  health  plans  and  health\ninsurance issuers are required to provide coverage consistent with the HRSA\nGuidelines, without cost sharing, in plan years (or, in the individual market, policy\nyears) beginning on or after August 1, 2012. . . . \n77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8725-8726 (footnotes omitted).  After reviewing the definition of “religious\nemployer” quoted above, see, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46623, and noting that the HRSA exercised\nits discretion to exempt “religious employers” from the contraceptive services coverage requirement,\n(see note 1, supra), the Rule summarizes comments that the Departments received about the\namended interim final regulations, see 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726-8727.  The Rule continues,\n2 In their brief in response to the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs refer to the\nRule as “the Final Rule.”  (Pls.’ Response Br. at 1, ECF No. 33.)  \n7\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 8 of 45 - Page ID # 211\nIn response to these comments, the Departments carefully considered whether\nto eliminate the religious employer exception or to adopt an alternative definition of\nreligious employer, including whether the exemption should be extended to a broader\nset of religiously-affiliated sponsors of group health plans and group health insurance\ncoverage.  For the reasons discussed below, the Departments are adopting the\ndefinition in the amended interim final regulations for purposes of these final\nregulations while also creating a temporary enforcement safe harbor, discussed\n below.  During the temporary enforcement safe harbor, the Departments plan to develop and\npropose  changes  to  these  final  regulations  that  would  meet  two  goals–providing\ncontraceptive coverage without cost-sharing to individuals who want it and accommodating\nnon-exempted, non-profit organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive\nservices . . . .\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8727.  \nWhen the Rule was posted, HSS issued a bulletin that established the aforementioned\n“temporary enforcement safe harbor.”  See Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care\nAct, 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16502 (Mar. 21, 2012) (citing HHS, Guidance on the Temporary\nEnforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans and Group Health Insurance\nIssuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing\nUnder Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (Feb. 10, 2012) (hereafter\n“the  Bulletin”)  available  at  http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-\nPreventive-Services-Bulletin.pdf).  (See also Compl. ¶ 71, ECF No. 1.)   “The bulletin confirmed\nthat all three Departments will not take any enforcement action against an employer, group health\nplan, or health insurance issuer that complies with the conditions of the temporary enforcement safe\nharbor described in the bulletin.”  77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503.  Generally, the temporary enforcement\nsafe harbor applies to “group health plans sponsored by non-profit organizations that, on and after\nFebruary 10, 2012, do not provide some or all of the contraceptive coverage otherwise required,\n8\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 9 of 45 - Page ID # 212\nconsistent with any applicable State law, because of the religious beliefs of the organization (and any\ngroup health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans).”  77 Fed. Reg. 16501,\n16502-16503.3  Also, the temporary enforcement safe harbor “is in effect until the first plan year that\nbegins on or after August 1, 2013.”  77 Fed. Reg.16501, 16503. \nThe Rule also states,\nBefore the end of the temporary enforcement safe harbor, the Departments\nwill work with stakeholders to develop alternative ways of providing contraceptive\ncoverage without cost sharing with respect to non-exempted, non-profit religious\norganizations  with  religious  objections  to  such  coverage.  Specifically,  the\nDepartments plan to initiate a rulemaking to require issuers to offer insurance without\ncontraception coverage to such an employer (or plan sponsor) and simultaneously to\noffer contraceptive coverage directly to the employer's plan participants (and their\nbeneficiaries) who desire it, with no cost-sharing. . . .  The Departments intend to\n3 More specifically, the bulletin extends the safe harbor to “employers,” “group health\nplans,” and “group health insurance issuers” that “fail[] to cover recommended contraceptive\nservices without cost sharing in non-exempted, non-grandfathered group health plans established\nor maintained by an organization” and that meet all of the following criteria: \n1. The organization is organized and operates as a non-profit entity.  \n2. From February 10, 2012 onward, contraceptive coverage has not been\nprovided at any point by the group health plan established or maintained\nby the organization, consistent with any applicable State law, because of\nthe religious beliefs of the organization.\n3. As detailed below, the group health plan established or maintained by the\norganization (or another entity on behalf of the plan, such as a health\ninsurance issuer or third-party administrator) must provide to participants\nthe attached notice, as described below, which states that contraceptive\ncoverage will not be provided under the plan for the first plan year\nbeginning on or after August 1, 2012.\n4. The organization self-certifies that it satisfies criteria 1-3 above, and\ndocuments its self-certification in accordance with the procedures detailed\nherein.\nBulletin at 3 (footnote omitted).\n9\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 10 of 45 - Page ID # 213\ndevelop policies to achieve the same goals for self-insured group health plans\nsponsored  by  non-exempted,  non-profit  religious  organizations  with  religious\nobjections to contraceptive coverage.\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8728.\nOn March 21, 2012, the Departments published an “advance notice of proposed rulemaking”\n(ANPRM).  77 Fed. Reg. 16501.  The ANPRM announces the intention of the Departments to\npropose amendments that “would establish alternative ways to fulfill the requirements of section\n2713 of the Public Health Service Act and companion provisions . . . when health coverage is\nsponsored or arranged by a religious organization that objects to the coverage of contraceptive\nservices for religious reasons and that is not exempt under the final regulations published February\n15, 2012 [(i.e., the Rule)].”  77 Fed. Reg. 16501.  The ANPRM notes that one of the Departments’\ngoals is “to protect . . . religious organizations from having to contract, arrange, or pay for\ncontraceptive coverage,” while also maintaining contraceptive coverage without cost sharing for\nindividuals who receive coverage through those organizations.  77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503.  It then\nsuggests “multiple options” for achieving these goals, and it states that “[t]he Departments seek input\non these options . . . as well as new ideas to inform the next stage of the rulemaking process.”  Id.\nSee also 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16504-16508.  In short, the ANPRM is “the first step toward\npromulgating . . . amended final regulations” prior to the end of the temporary enforcement safe\nharbor that will “accommodat[e] non-exempt, non-profit religious organizations’ religious objections\nto covering contraceptive services and assur[e] that participants and beneficiaries covered under such\norganizations’ plans receive contraceptive coverage without cost sharing.”  77 Fed. Reg. 16501,\n16503.  It provides “an early opportunity for any interested stakeholder to provide advice and input\ninto the policy development relating to the accommodation to be made” to organizations with\n10\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 11 of 45 - Page ID # 214\nreligious objections to contraceptive coverage.  Id.  Also, the ANPRM states, “Following the receipt\nof public comment, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will be published, which will permit\nadditional public comment, followed by amended final regulations.”  Id.    \nC.     The Plaintiffs’ Allegations\nAs noted above, the plaintiffs allege generally that the Rule “would coerce religious\norganizations, institutions, care providers, outreach groups, and social services agencies, among\nothers, to directly subsidize contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services in\ncontravention [of] their religious beliefs.”  (Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 1.)  They add that “[t]he Rule was\ndefinitively and formally promulgated by publication in the Federal Register as a ‘Final Rule,’” and\n“there is no hint that the Rule is informal, tentative, . . . [or] only the ruling of a subordinate official,\nor that full compliance with the Rule is not expected.”  (Id. ¶ 70 (citation omitted).)  Furthermore,\nthey allege that they are each at risk for irreparable injury, “[n]otwithstanding [their] ability or\ninability to qualify for” the temporary enforcement safe harbor, because “[n]o discernable statutory\nor regulatory obstacle exists barring the Federal Government from unilaterally withdrawing its\npromise of” the safe harbor, and because the “[p]laintiffs will absolutely be required to comply upon\nthe expiration of the safe harbor on August 1, 2013.”  (Id. ¶\\¶ 73-74 (emphasis omitted).)   \nThe specific injuries allegedly faced by each of the plaintiffs merit further discussion.  First,\nthe plaintiffs allege that Sister Mary Catherine is covered by a health insurance plan “through the\nCatholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska,” that “has been specifically contracted for to exclude\ncoverage for purposes of contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services”; that her\nhealth insurance plan “is not grandfathered from ACA requirements”;  that “[h]ealth [i]nsurance\ncoverage of . . . contraception, abortifacients, or sterilization [contravenes her] religious beliefs”; and\n11\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 12 of 45 - Page ID # 215\nthat she “will drop her private health insurance coverage if retaining such coverage would result in\nthe subsidization of contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 17-\n21, ECF No. 1.  See also id. ¶¶ 75-76 (alleging, inter alia, that Sister Mary Catherine “will be forced\nto pay civil penalties and forego health insurance altogether”).)  \nSimilarly, the plaintiffs allege that Molai is “covered by a health insurance plan” that “has\nbeen specifically contracted for to exclude coverage for purposes of contraception, abortifacients,\nsterilization, and related services”–all of which contravene Molai’s religious beliefs–and that Molai\nwill “drop [health] coverage if it would result in her subsidization” of those services.  (Id. ¶¶ 24-26,\n30, 75.)  In addition, the plaintiffs allege that “Molai suffers from an incurable chronic illness which\nrequires substantial ongoing care” and “occasionally necessitates hospitalization and surgery,” and\ntherefore “[h]ealth insurance coverage is critical to Molai in order to avoid financial ruin and\npossibly life threatening consequences.”  (Id. ¶¶ 27-30.)  Unlike Sister Mary Catherine’s plan,\n“Molai’s current health insurance plan is grandfathered from ACA requirements.”  (Id. ¶ 31\n(emphasis omitted).)  The plaintiffs allege, however, that “[u]pon [such] time Molai or her employer\n. . . substantially changes any aspect of Molai’s health insurance plan, Molai’s plan will immediately\nbecome subject to ACA requirements and the contraceptive coverage Rule promulgated pursuant\nthereto.”  (Id. ¶ 32.  See also id. ¶ 33 (“Since the ACA’s grandfathering exemption does not apply\nto health insurance plans which substantially change after March 23, 2010, Molai is trapped in her\ncurrent plan if she wishes to remain grandfathered from ACA requirements.”); id. ¶¶ 88-89.)   \nThe plaintiffs allege that Catholic Social Services “has more than 50 persons on staff,” and\nits “purpose is to serve persons of all religious and ethnic backgrounds.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 36-37, ECF No.\n1.)  “Though Catholic Social Services exists and conducts its ministry pursuant to a religiously-\n12\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 13 of 45 - Page ID # 216\nrooted sense of purpose, mission, and duty, its primary operational purpose is not the inculcation of\nreligious values.”  (Id. ¶ 38.)  “Catholic Social Services is covered by a health insurance plan” that\n“has  been  specifically  contracted  for  to  exclude  coverage  for  purposes  of  contraception,\nabortifacients, sterilization, and related services,” all of which contravene “Catholic teaching and\ndoctrine adhered to . . . by Catholic Social Services.”  (Id. ¶¶ 39-41.)  The plaintiffs allege that\n“Catholic  Social  Services’  current  health  insurance  plan  is  not  grandfathered  from  ACA\nrequirements,” and that Catholic Social Services will drop its plan if retaining it “would result in the\nsubsidization of” the aforementioned services.  (Id. ¶¶ 42-43 (emphasis omitted).)  \nPius X, which “employs more than 70 faculty and staff,” “is dedicated to [providing] a\nChrist-centered education that integrates Catholic values in all areas of life and [to] providing\nacademic preparation of the highest quality in a disciplined environment.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 45-46, ECF\nNo. 1.)  The plaintiffs allege that Pius X, like Catholic Social Services, “is covered by” a non-\ngrandfathered health insurance plan that excludes coverage for contraception, abortifacients,\nsterilization, and related services, all of which contravene “Catholic teaching and doctrine adhered\nto . . . by Pius X.”  (Id. ¶¶ 47-50.) \n“Catholic Mutual provides health coverage to its employees through a group health plan” that\n“is currently grandfathered from ACA’s requirements.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 52, 59, ECF No. 1.)  The\nplaintiffs allege, however, that “Catholic Mutual comprehensively evaluates its employee health plan\non an annual basis,” and “[i]f Catholic Mutual substantially changes certain aspects of its employee\nhealth  insurance  plan,  [it]  will  immediately  become  subject  to  ACA  requirements  and  the\ncontraceptive coverage Rule.”  (Id. ¶¶ 61-62.  See also id. ¶ 60 (alleging that “Catholic Mutual is\ntrapped in its current plan if it wishes to remain grandfathered from ACA requirements”).)  Catholic\n13\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 14 of 45 - Page ID # 217\nMutual “does not primarily employ persons who share [its] religious tenets,” and it “does not inquire\nas to the religious affiliation or beliefs of prospective employees.”  (Id. ¶¶ 53-54.)  Furthermore,\n“[a]lthough Catholic Mutual exists and conducts its operations pursuant to a religious-rooted sense\nof purpose, mission, and duty,” the plaintiffs allege that “Catholic Mutual’s primary operational\npurpose is not the inculcation of religious values.”  (Id. ¶ 55.)  “Coverage of services for purposes\nof contraception, abortifacients, or sterilization” contravenes “Catholic teaching and doctrine adhered\nto . . . by Catholic Mutual”; thus, it “does not include coverage of [those] services . . . in its\nemployees’ health insurance plans,” and its “employees are not offered supplemental insurance plans\nto cover [those services] . . . in connection with their primary employer-subsidized health care\nplans.”  (Id. ¶¶ 56-58.) \nThe plaintiffs allege that the Rule encroaches “on the liberty of the religious organization\nemployers . . . by mandating that [they] subsidize coverage for contraceptives, sterilization, and\nrelated patient education and counseling.”  (Compl. ¶ 77, ECF No. 1.)  They add that in the event\nthat the organizational plaintiffs’ health insurance plans “are no longer grandfathered plans,” there\nare “two ways in which [they] can circumvent the Rule’s requirements: declining to provide health\ninsurance altogether and fac[ing] a stiff per-employee penalty[,] or satisfying all of the criteria to\nqualify for  a  ‘religious employer’ exemption.”  (Id. ¶ 82.)   The plaintiffs allege that the\norganizational plaintiffs “are not eligible for the . . . narrow religious employer exemption to the\nRule, based on the Federal Government’s stated intent to exclude hospitals, schools, and universities\nand  because  [the  p]laintiffs  do  not  clearly  satisfy  all  of  the  exemptions  rigid  conjunctive\nrequirements.”  (Id. ¶ 83.)  They also claim that the Rule’s religious employer exemption will not\ncover the organizational plaintiffs unless “Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High School,\n14\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 15 of 45 - Page ID # 218\nand Catholic Mutual . . . begin inquiring into the religious affiliation and beliefs of prospective\nemployees–a practice in which Catholic Social Services and Catholic Mutual currently do not\nengage.”  (Id. ¶ 79.)  In addition, the plaintiffs allege that Pius X has “enjoyed the certainty of broad\nreligious employer exemptions” in other contexts, but “[d]ue to the insufficiently narrow nature of\nthe religious employer exemption to the Rule,” Pius X “face[s] great uncertainty in determining\nwhether [it] will enjoy the same religious employer exemptions from government mandates as they\nhave in the past.”  (Id. ¶¶ 80-81.)  \nAccording to the complaint, the State plaintiffs will be injured by the Rule in the following\nways.  First, the plaintiffs allege that because the Rule offends the religious beliefs of “religious\norganization employers,” those employers “may simply cease [to provide] health insurance coverage\nto their employees . . . rather than subsidize conduct and services in violation of their beliefs.”\n(Compl. ¶ 84, ECF No. 1.)  Then, “[i]f religious employers were to cease [to provide] health\ninsurance in order to avoid the requirements of the Rule, an immediate and substantial spike in the\nnumber of enrollments in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs would result, as many impacted\nemployees would invariably shift to Medicaid to remain in compliance with the ACA’s individual\ncoverage mandate.”  (Id. ¶ 85.)  The plaintiffs add that the State plaintiffs’ “Medicaid programs are\nalready facing the acute strain of dramatically increased enrollments due to the ACA’s individual\ncoverage mandate,” and “[f]orcing another round of enrollments will compound this problem and\nfurther threaten Plaintiff States’ budgetary stability.”  (Id. ¶ 86.)  “In addition, religious organization\nemployers operating in Plaintiff[] States will cease providing charitable services to persons who do\nnot share their religious tenets, in an effort to qualify under the Religious Employer Exemption.\nThose people no longer served by such charitable services will place further pressure on Plaintiff\n15\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 16 of 45 - Page ID # 219\nStates’ Medicaid programs as they inevitably increase reliance on public resources for support.”  (Id.\n¶ 87.)\nIn Count I of their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the Rule violates the Free Speech\nClause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because it compels them to\n“subsidize” beliefs and conduct that violate their moral and religious beliefs, and because it prohibits\nthem “from expressing a message in accordance with their beliefs.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 91-94, ECF No. 1.)\nIn Count II, the plaintiffs allege that the Rule violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause\n“by negating the right of Plaintiffs to act in accordance with their beliefs.”  (Id. ¶ 96.)  They add that\nthe Rule “imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise,” “coerces Plaintiffs to\nchange or violate their religious beliefs,” “chills Plaintiffs’ religious exercise,” “exposes Plaintiffs\nto substantial fines for [their] religious exercise,” and negates “the right of Plaintiffs to freely\npractice their religious beliefs without government interference.”  (Id. ¶¶ 100-104.  See also id. ¶¶\n95, 97-99 (alleging that “[t]he Rule furthers no compelling governmental interest” and “is not the\nleast restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated interests”).)  In Count III, the plaintiffs allege\nthat the Rule violates the First Amendment’s Freedom of Association Clause because it “negat[es]\nthe rights of Plaintiffs to organize voluntary religious associations by forcing Plaintiffs to associate\nwith an ideology that violates their religious beliefs” and “negat[es] the rights of Plaintiffs to\norganize voluntary religious associations that serve persons of other beliefs.”  (Id. ¶¶ 105-107.)  In\nCount IV, the plaintiffs allege that “[t]he Rule works a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’ ability\nto freely practice their religion” in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993\n(RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.  (Compl. ¶ 109, ECF No. 1.  See also id. ¶¶ 108,\n110-117 (alleging that the Rule “chills Plaintiffs’ religious exercise,” “exposes Plaintiffs to\n16\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 17 of 45 - Page ID # 220\nsubstantial fines for its [sic] religious exercise,” “furthers no compelling governmental interest and\nis not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental interest,” “is not the least restrictive means\nof furthering Defendants’ stated interests,” “puts substantial pressure on religious adherents to\nmodify religious beliefs and behavior in order to comply with the Rule’s mandates,” and “is a\nsubstantial burden on the rights of Plaintiffs to freely exercise religion because it forces them to\nsubsidize contraceptives in violation of their religious beliefs”; that the Rule’s exception for religious\nemployers  “violates  RFRA  because  [it]  would  require  the  government  to  troll  through  an\norganization’s religious beliefs to determine whether the organization is religious enough to be\nexempt from the Rule’s dictates,” and that “[t]he Rule’s compulsory funding of contraceptives is a\nsubstantial burden upon the Plaintiffs because it impermissibly interferes in matters of church faith\nand doctrine”).)  In Count V, the plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to relief under the Declaratory\nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, because “[t]here is an actual controversy of sufficient immediacy\nand concreteness relating to the legal rights and duties of the Plaintiffs and their legal relations with\nthe Defendants,” and “[t]he harm to the Plaintiffs as a direct result of the Rule is sufficiently real and\nimminent to warrant the issuance of a conclusive declaratory judgment clarifying the legal relations\nof the parties.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 118-120, ECF No. 1.)  \nBased on all of the foregoing allegations, the plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Rule\nviolates the First Amendment, RFRA, and “the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights”; an order that 1)\nenjoins the defendants “and any other agency or employee acting on behalf of the United States from\nenforcing the Rule against the Plaintiffs, their citizens and residents, and any of their agencies or\nofficials or employees” and 2) requires the defendants “to take such actions as are necessary and\n17\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 18 of 45 - Page ID # 221\nproper to remedy their violations”; and an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  (See\nCompl. at 21-22, 23, ECF No. 1.)  \nII.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA.     Rule 12(b)(6)\n“Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires that a complaint present ‘a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc., 588 F.3d 585, 594 (8th Cir. 2009).  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a\ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  It is important to note, however, that “the tenet that a court\nmust accept as true all of  the  allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal\nconclusions.”  Id.  “A pleading that offers ‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action will not do.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  “Nor does a\ncomplaint suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’”  Id.\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). \n “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court\nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id. (citation\nomitted).  “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more\nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n556).  “Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability, it\n‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’”  Id. (quoting\n18\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 19 of 45 - Page ID # 222\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, “where the well-\npleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the\ncomplaint has alleged–but it has not ‘shown’–‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Id. at 1950\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)) (brackets omitted).\nB.     Rule 12(b)(1) and Standing\nA plaintiff's standing to sue “is the threshold question in every federal case” because it\ndetermines “the power of the court to entertain the suit.”  McClain v. American Economy Ins. Co.,\n424 F.3d 728, 731 (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 892 (8th Cir.\n2000)).  The concept of standing is rooted in Article III, § 2, of the United States Constitution,\n“which limits the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts to actual cases and controversies.”  Id.\nThus, if standing is lacking, then this court has no subject matter jurisdiction.  E.g., Gray v. City of\nValley Park, Mo., 567 F.3d 976, 980 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Young America Corp. v. Affiliated\nComputer Services (ACS), Inc., 424 F.3d 840, 843 (8th Cir. 2005)).  See also Faibisch v. University\nof Minnesota, 304 F.3d 797, 801 (8th Cir. 2002) (“[A] standing argument implicates Rule\n12(b)(1).”).4  \nA motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may challenge\neither the factual truthfulness or the facial sufficiency of the plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations.  See,\ne.g., Stalley v. Catholic Health Initiatives, 509 F.3d 517, 520-21 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing Osborn v.\n4 As will be discussed below, some elements of the doctrine of standing “are prudential,\ninvolving self imposed limits on judicial power” that “may be ‘modified or abrogated by\nCongress.”  Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 588 F.3d 585, 591 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Bennett\nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997)).  “The heart of standing, however, is the principle that in\norder to invoke the power of a federal court, a plaintiff must present a ‘case’ or controversy’\nwithin the meaning of Article III of the Constitution.”  Id. \n19\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 20 of 45 - Page ID # 223\nUnited States, 918 F.2d 724, 729 n.6 (8th Cir. 1990)).  In a facial attack, the standard of review is\nthe same standard that applies to motions brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6), and which I have outlined above: I must “accept as true all factual allegations in the\ncomplaint, giving no effect to conclusory allegations of law,” and I must determine whether the\nplaintiff has asserted “facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that the pleader has the right he\nclaims (here, the right to jurisdiction), rather than facts that are merely consistent with such a right.”\nStalley, 509 F.3d at 521 (citing, inter alia, Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-57\n(2007)).  In contrast, “[w]hen a district court engages in a factual review, it inquires into and resolves\nfactual disputes.”  Faibisch, 304 F.3d at 801.  See also Titus v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 590, 593 & n.1 (8th\nCir. 1993).  In this case, the defendants have made a facial attack upon the plaintiffs’ jurisdictional\nallegations, (see Defs.’ Br. at 11, ECF No. 31), and their motion to dismiss will be analyzed\naccordingly.     \nIII.     ANALYSIS\nThe defendants argue that the complaint must be dismissed because the plaintiffs lack\nstanding and their claims are not ripe.  (See Defs.’s Br. at 11-33, ECF No. 31.)  The defendants add\nthat the State plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6).  (See id. at 33-35.)  I shall analyze each of the defendants’ arguments in turn.\nA.     Whether the Organizational Plaintiffs Lack Standing\nThe defendants argue first that the claims of the organizational plaintiffs (i.e., Catholic Social\nServices, Pius X, and Catholic Mutual) must be dismissed because those plaintiffs have not\n20\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 21 of 45 - Page ID # 224\nestablished that they have standing to sue.  (Defs. Br. at 12-17, ECF No. 31.)  I agree with the\ndefendants. \n“[T]o satisfy Article III's standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an\n‘injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is\nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”\nMcClain v. American Economy Ins. Co., 424 F.3d 728, 731 (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000)).  “The\npurpose of the imminence requirement is ‘to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative .\n. . [and] that the injury is certainly impending.”  United States v. Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer Dist.,\n569 F.3d 829, 834 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2\n(1992)).  “The part[ies] invoking federal jurisdiction”–here, the plaintiffs–“bear[] the burden of\nestablishing these elements.”  Young America Corp., 424 F.3d at 843 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).\nThe defendants claim that the organizational plaintiffs “fail[ed] to demonstrate a concrete and\nimminent injury resulting from the operation of the preventive service coverage regulations.”  (Id.\nat 13.)  In support of this argument, the defendants submit that the organizational plaintiffs “have\nnot made sufficient factual allegations to show that the group health plans they offer to their\nemployees are not eligible for grandfather status.”  (Id.)5  \n5 As noted previously, the preventive health service coverage regulations–including the\nRule–do not apply to grandfathered plans.  See, e.g., 77 Fed. Reg. 8725; 75 Fed. Reg. 41726; 26\nC.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R. 2590.715-1251; 45 C.F.R. § 147.140.  Thus, if a plan is\ngrandfathered within the meaning of the regulations, it will not be required to provide coverage\nfor contraceptive services.\n21\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 22 of 45 - Page ID # 225\nPius X and Catholic Social Services allege that their group health plans are not grandfathered.\n(See Compl. ¶¶ 43, 50, ECF No. 1; Pls.’ Response Br. at 6-7, ECF No. 33.)  Although the plaintiffs\nargue that this allegation “must be accepted as true,” (Pls.’ Response Br. at 25, ECF No. 33), a\n“naked assertion” that a plan does not satisfy the legal definition of “grandfathered health plans” is\nnot sufficient.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\n550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007).  As explained above, legal conclusions are not entitled to the benefit of\n“the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint.”  Id.\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  To meet their burden, the plaintiffs must plead facts showing\nthat the Pius X and Catholic Social Services plans are not grandfathered.  E.g., Metropolitan St.\nLouis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d at 834 (“To demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must clearly allege facts\nshowing an injury in fact . . . .”).  By way of example, if a plaintiff were to allege that its plan has\nnot “continuously covered someone since March 23, 2010,” that factual allegation would be entitled\nto deference, and it would render plausible the legal conclusion that the plan was not grandfathered.\nSee  26  C.F.R.  §  54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i);  29  C.F.R.  2590.715-1251(a)(1)(i);  45  C.F.R.  §\n147.140(a)(1)(i).  See also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(g)(1) (“Maintenance of grandfather status”);\n29 C.F.R. 2590.715-1251(g)(1) (same); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g)(1) (same).6  Here, however, the\nplaintiffs have failed to plead specific facts showing that the Pius X and Catholic Social Services\n6 As an alternate example, I note that the complaint alleges that Catholic Social Services\ndoes not limit “its provision of services to person[s] who share its religious tenets,” and “its\nprimary operational purpose is not the inculcation of religious values.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 37-38, ECF\nNo. 1.)  These are factual allegations which must be taken as true, and they show that it is\nplausible that Catholic Mutual cannot satisfy the legal definition of “religious employer” for\npurposes of the Rule’s exemption.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B)(1), (3) (stating that an\norganization is a “religious employer” if “[t]he inculcation of religious values is the purpose of\nthe organization” and if it “serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the\norganization”).\n22\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 23 of 45 - Page ID # 226\nplans are not grandfathered.  As a result, they have not shown that they are subject to the Rule’s\ncontraceptive, sterilization, and related preventive service coverage requirements, and I must dismiss\ntheir claims for lack of standing.   \nCatholic Mutual admits that its group health plan is grandfathered.  (Defs.’ Br. at 13, ECF\nNo. 31 (citing Compl. ¶ 59, ECF No. 1).)  The plaintiffs allege, however, that “Catholic Mutual is\ntrapped in its current plan if it wishes to remain grandfathered from ACA requirements.”  (Compl.\n¶ 60, ECF No. 1.  See also id. ¶ 88.)  They add, “Given that the Federal Government itself has\nconceded that employers and individuals will inevitably find it necessary to make substantial\nmodifications to health insurance plans, particularly in light of spiraling costs and a fluctuating\nregulatory environment, it is readily apparent that currently-grandfathered Plaintiffs will lose their\nexemption from ACA requirements in the foreseeable future; it is unrealistic to presume they can\nremain grandfathered in perpetuity.”  (Id. ¶ 89.)  Notably, the plaintiffs do not allege that Catholic\nMutual intends to make–or is even contemplating–specific changes to its plan that would end its\ngrandfathered status.  Instead, the plaintiffs merely speculate and/or assume that Catholic Mutual will\nlose grandfathered status sometime in the future.  This is insufficient to establish Catholic Mutual’s\nstanding to sue.  See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992) (“Although\n‘imminence’ is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched beyond its purpose,\nwhich is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes . . . .  It has\nbeen stretched beyond the breaking point when, as here, the plaintiff alleges only an injury at some\nindefinite future time, and the acts necessary to make the injury happen are at least partly within the\nplaintiff’s own control.”). \n23\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 24 of 45 - Page ID # 227\nIn a similar vein, the plaintiffs argue that substantial modifications to Catholic Mutual’s\ngrandfathered plan are “bound to occur” because projections indicate that “only 55% of large\nemployer and 34% of small employer plans would remain grandfathered by 2013.”  (Pl.’s Response\nBr. at 7-8, ECF No. 33.)  These projections do not avail the plaintiffs; indeed, I do not see that they\nare relevant.  It is the plaintiffs’ burden to allege facts showing that they lack (or will soon lose)\ngrandfather status, and thereby establish that it is plausible that they will be subject to the\nrequirements of the Rule.  They have failed to do so, and references to data showing that many plans\nmight lose grandfathered status by 2013 do not cure this failure.  \nThe plaintiffs also argue that “the organizational . . . Plaintiffs face an imminent decision to\neither compromise their religious beliefs or violate the law,” and therefore they “have standing to\npursue their claim.”  (Pls.’ Response Br. at 5, ECF No. 33.)   More specifically, they state that the\norganizational plaintiffs’ “plans have been specifically contracted to exclude coverage for . . .\ncontraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services,” and they “will be coerced into\npurchasing or subsidizing coverage in direct contravention of their beliefs or dropping coverage\noutright if the Final Rule is upheld.”  (Id. at 6.)  This coercion, they argue, “constitutes an injury-in-\nfact.”  (Id.)  Because the Rule does not apply to grandfathered plans, however, the organizational\nplaintiffs face no “coercion” (or any other imminent injury traceable to the Rule) unless their current\nplans are not grandfathered.  The complaint does not allege facts showing that the organizational\nplaintiffs’ plans are not grandfathered, and therefore those plaintiffs have not established their\nstanding to sue.  \nI note in passing that the defendants have submitted an alternate argument in support of their\nposition that the organizational plaintiffs lack standing.  (See Defs.’ Br. at 14-16, ECF No. 31.)\n24\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 25 of 45 - Page ID # 228\nSpecifically, the defendants argue that “even if the organization[al] plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged\nthat their group health plans are not grandfathered, they still would not have alleged an injury in fact”\nbecause the temporary enforcement safe harbor will protect them until August 1, 2013, and the Rule\nis “undergoing amendment” during the meantime.  (See Defs.’ Br. at 14, ECF No. 31; see also id.\nat 15-16.)  It seems to me that this argument implicates the doctrine of ripeness more so than\nstanding, and therefore I shall revisit it briefly in a later section of this memorandum. \nB.     Whether the Individual Plaintiffs Lack Standing\nThe defendants argue that the individual plaintiffs (i.e., Sister Mary Catherine and Molai)\nlack standing for the same reason that the organizational plaintiffs lack standing–i.e., they have failed\nto allege facts showing that “their current health plans, which do not offer contraception, are not\ngrandfathered and thus excluded from the requirement to cover contraceptive services.”  (Defs.’ Br.\nat 18, ECF No. 31.)  Again, I agree with the defendants.\nSister Mary Catherine alleges that she “is covered by a health insurance plan with Blue Cross\nBlue Shield of Nebraska through the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska,” and that this plan “is\nnot grandfathered from ACA requirements.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 17, 21, ECF No. 1 (emphasis omitted).)\nAs explained in Part III.A, the plaintiffs’ allegation that Sister Mary Catherine’s plan is not\ngrandfathered cannot be accepted as true because it is a legal conclusion, and “[a] pleading that\noffers ‘labels and conclusions’ . . . will not do.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)\n(quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  The plaintiffs have not\npleaded specific facts showing that Sister Mary Catherine’s plan is not grandfathered, and therefore\nthey have not shown that it is plausible that Sister Mary Catherine will be subject to the requirements\n25\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 26 of 45 - Page ID # 229\nof the Rule.  Thus, she has not shown that she faces imminent injury, and her standing is not\nestablished.   \nLike Catholic Mutual, Molai admits that her health plan is grandfathered.  (Compl. ¶ 31, ECF\nNo. 1.)  Also like Catholic Mutual, Molai alleges that she “is trapped in her current plan if she\nwishes to remain grandfathered from ACA requirements”; that her “plan will immediately become\nsubject to ACA requirements and the contraceptive coverage Rule” when “her employer, FOCUS,\nsubstantially changes any aspect of” the plan; and “it is unrealistic to presume” that her plan “can\nremain grandfathered in perpetuity.”  (Id. ¶¶ 32-33, 89.)  As explained in Part III.A above, however,\nspeculation that Molai’s plan may change “at some indefinite future time” is insufficient to establish\nher standing to sue.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992).\nFurthermore, neither Sister Mary Catherine nor Molai have alleged facts indicating that their\nemployers do not qualify for the Rule’s religious employers exception.  As noted previously, the\nRule does not apply to a “religious employer,” which is defined as an organization that meets the\nfollowing criteria: (1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization; (2) The\norganization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the organization; (3) The\norganization serves primarily persons who share the  religious tenets of the organization; and (4) The\norganization  is  a  nonprofit  organization  as  described  in  section  6033(a)(1)  and  section\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.

The\n26\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 27 of 45 - Page ID # 230\nplaintiffs allege that the “Rule’s religious employer exemption is insufficiently narrow [sic]” because\n“it fails to cover a significant number of organizations.”  (Compl. ¶ 78, ECF No. 1.)  They also allege\nthat Catholic Social Services and Catholic Mutual do not qualify for the exemption because they do\nnot “inquir[e] into the religious affiliation and beliefs of prospective employees,” and they allege that\nPius X (and other plaintiffs) “are not eligible for the . . . religious employer exemption . . . based on\nthe Federal Government’s stated intent to exclude hospitals, schools, and universities.”  (Id. ¶¶ 79,\n83.)7  The plaintiffs allege no facts, however, showing that Sister Mary Catherine’s employer (i.e.,\neither School Sisters of Christ the King or the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska) or Molai’s\nemployer (i.e., FOCUS) do not qualify for the religious employer’s exemption.  Thus, for this\nadditional reason, the plaintiffs have failed to establish that Sister Mary Catherine and Molai have\nstanding to sue.  \nIn short, the individual plaintiffs have not shown that their current health plans will be\nrequired to cover contraception-related services under the Rule, and therefore their claims must be\ndismissed for lack of standing.8\n7 I note in passing that the plaintiffs have referred me to no authority indicating that\n“hospitals, schools, and universities” are categorically excluded–or intended to be excluded–from\nthe religious employer exception even if they satisfy all of the criteria listed in the regulation.\n8 The defendants repeat their alternative argument that the individual plaintiffs lack\nstanding because the temporary enforcement safe harbor will protect them until August 1, 2013,\nand the Rule will be amended before the safe harbor expires.  (See Defs.’ Br. at 19-20, ECF No.\n31.)  I shall briefly address this argument below when reviewing the issue of ripeness. \n27\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 28 of 45 - Page ID # 231\nC.     Whether the State Plaintiffs Lack Standing\n1.     Article III Standing\nThe State plaintiffs allege that they have standing to sue in their own right9 because, “[a]s a\nresult of the Rule’s compulsory violation of religious organization employers’ religious beliefs,\nreligious organization employers in Plaintiff States, such as Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services and\nCatholic Mutual, may simply cease the provision of health insurance coverage to their employees,\nrather than subsidize conduct and services in violation of their beliefs.” (Compl. ¶ 84, ECF No. 1.)\nThey continue, “If religious organization employers were to cease provision of health insurance in\norder to avoid the requirements of the Rule, an immediate and substantial spike in the number of\nenrollments in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs would result, as many impacted employees would\ninvariably shift to Medicaid to remain in compliance with the ACA’s individual coverage mandate.”\n(Id. ¶ 85.)  Also, the plaintiffs allege that “religious organization employers operating in Plaintiff\nStates will cease providing charitable services to persons who do not share their religious tenets, in\nan effort to qualify under the Religious Employer Exemption.  Those people no longer served by\nsuch charitable services will place further pressure on Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs as they\ninevitably increase reliance on public resources for support.”  (Id. ¶ 87.)  \nThe defendants argue that the State plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to establish their\nstanding to sue.  (Defs.’ Br. at 22-26, ECF No. 31.)  The defendants are correct.\nAs noted previously, in order to satisfy the standing requirements of Article III of the United\nStates Constitution, a plaintiff must show that “it has suffered an ‘injury in fact’ that is (a) concrete\n9 The State plaintiffs state that they are “are not bringing this suit as a parens patriae\naction.”  (Pl.’s Response Br. at 17, ECF No. 33; see also id. at 17-18; Defs.’ Br. at 21-22, ECF\nNo. 31.)  \n28\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 29 of 45 - Page ID # 232\nand particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” McClain v. American\nEconomy Ins. Co., 424 F.3d 728, 731 (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\nEnvironmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000)) (emphasis added).  A plaintiff\nmust also show that “the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,” and that\n“it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\ndecision.”  Id.  Moreover, “[w]hen the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action\nor inaction he challenges,” as is the case here insofar as the State plaintiffs are concerned, “standing\nis not precluded, but it is ordinarily ‘substantially more difficult to establish.’”  Summers v. Earth\nIsland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 493-94 (2009) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n562 (1992)).  The Supreme Court has explained, \n[When a plaintiff’s alleged injury arises from the government’s allegedly unlawful\nregulation of someone else], causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the\nresponse of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or\ninaction–and perhaps on the response of others as well.  The existence of one or more\nof the essential elements of standing “depends on the unfettered choices made by\nindependent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate\ndiscretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,” and it becomes\nthe burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or\nwill be made in such a manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of\ninjury.\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (citations omitted).10\n10 It merits emphasis that at this stage of the proceeding, the plaintiffs are not required to\n“adduce facts” showing that third parties will react in such a way that the causation and\nredressability elements of standing are met; rather, they need only allege facts that are sufficient\nto state plausibly that third parties will act in such a way that the elements of standing are met. \nSee, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (explaining that the degree of support required for each element\nof standing differs at each successive stage of the case).  \n29\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 30 of 45 - Page ID # 233\nThe complaint does not allege that the State plaintiffs will suffer “‘direct injur[ies]’ resulting\nfrom the [defendants’] challenged conduct.”  McClain, 424 F.3d at 731.  Instead, the State plaintiffs’\ntheory of standing is based on layers of conjecture.  First, the plaintiffs speculate that there are\nreligious employers who are subject to the Rule’s requirements and who will cease to provide health\ncoverage to their employees in order to avoid subsidizing contraceptive services that conflict with\ntheir religious beliefs.  Then, the plaintiffs speculate that if those employers do elect to cease\nproviding coverage, the employees of those organizations will seek (and obtain) Medicaid coverage\nfrom the States,11 which will cause the States to suffer budgetary strain.  Alternately, the plaintiffs\nspeculate that religious organization employers who do continue to provide health coverage to their\nemployees will attempt to qualify for the Rule’s religious employer exemption by ceasing to provide\ncharitable services to persons who do not share the organizations’ religious views, and this in turn\nwill cause those unserved persons to rely on State resources.  Both alternatives allege hypothetical\ninjuries to the States based on conjecture about the reactions of third parties, and the complaint\nsimply does not allege facts showing that it is plausible–and not merely possible–that those reactions\n“have been or will be made” in the manner that the plaintiffs suggest.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  \nIn short, because the State plaintiffs’ alleged injuries depend upon “the unfettered choices\nmade by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate\ndiscretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,” the plaintiffs have the\n“substantially more difficult” burden of alleging facts showing plausibly that the independent actors\nwill behave in such a way that the elements of standing can be met.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (citation\n11 The defendants correctly note that the plaintiffs’ theory ignores–and likely conflicts\nwith–the eligibility requirements for Medicaid.  (See Defs.’ Br. at 25 & n.13, ECF No. 31 (citing\n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i); 1396e(c)(2).)  \n30\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 31 of 45 - Page ID # 234\nomitted).  The complaint does not allege such facts; rather, it merely offers guesses about how\nindependent actors will respond to the Rule and speculation that these responses could cause people\nto qualify for, and obtain, state benefits that they would not otherwise seek, which will then strain\nthe States’s budgets.12  This is not sufficient to establish standing.  Cf. County of Mille Lacs v.\nBenjamin, 361 F.3d 460, 464 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that “speculative harms based on the assumed\nfuture intent” of others do not establish injury in fact).\nIn opposition to the defendants’ motion, the State plaintiffs repeat their claims that the Rule\nwill threaten their budgetary stability when religious organization employers drop coverage for their\nemployees (and thereby shift costs to the States).  (See Pl.’s Response Br. at 14, ECF No. 33.)  In\nsupport of their position, they refer me to data indicating that Medicaid spending “has expanded\nexponentially” and will continue to expand under the ACA generally.  (Pls.’ Response Br. at 14-16,\nECF No. 33.  See also id. at 25-26.)  They add that “Plaintiff States have already demonstrated an\ninterest in opposing the ACA as a whole due, in part, to the law’s massive effect on the States’\nMedicaid program,” and that their “interest in opposing the Final Rule . . . rests in part on related\ngrounds.”  (Id. at 16.  See also id. at 15 (discussing Medicaid spending attributable to “the ACA’s\nother requirements” in combination with the speculated increases stemming from the Rule); id. at\n26-27 (discussing the anticipated costs of ACA section 1311 and “the ACA’s individual coverage\nmandate”).)  It is irrelevant, however, whether the State plaintiffs might have some interest in\nopposing the ACA apart from the Rule, or that the ACA–taken as a whole–is expected to strain the\n12 It should be noted that the complaint does not show that it is plausible that any of the\norganizations or individuals who are participating in this case as plaintiffs will respond to the\nRule in such a way that the State plaintiffs’ budgets will be strained; indeed, the complaint does\nnot properly allege that any of the individual or organizational plaintiffs will be subject to the\nRule at all.  (See supra Parts III.A-B.)  \n31\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 32 of 45 - Page ID # 235\nState plaintiffs’ budgets.  To demonstrate standing to challenge the Rule, the State plaintiffs must\nestablish an injury in fact that is traceable to the Rule.  See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6\n(1996) (“If the right to complain of one administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right\nto complain of all administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the\nwhole structure of state administration before the courts for review.  That is of course not the law.\nAs we have said, “[n]or does a plaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one kind\npossess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating conduct of another kind, although\nsimilar, to which he has not been subject.” (quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 999 (1982)).\nThe State plaintiffs cannot rely on unrelated claims concerning different aspects of the ACA to\nestablish standing in this action.\nThe State plaintiffs also argue that “[c]ourts have recognized states’ economic interests [are]\nadequate to support a claim.”  (Pls.’ Response Br. at 26, ECF No. 33.)  In support of their argument,\nthe State plaintiffs cite Dixon v. Heckler, 589 F. Supp. 1512 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), and Avery v. Heckler,\n584 F. Supp. 312 (D. Mass. 1984).  I find, however, that these cases are each distinguishable from\nthe instant one.  \nIn Dixon, the State of New York was permitted to intervene in an action challenging “the\nlegality of the standards by which claims for [federal] disability benefits are evaluated.”  589 F.\nSupp. at 1513.  The State was allowed to intervene “as of right” pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 24(a)(2) for two separate reasons.  First, intervention was in order because there was a\n“threat of a possible federal take-over of the State’s program if it refuse[d] to follow regulations it\nbelieve[d] to be illegal.”  Id. at 1515.  Second–and for present purposes, more importantly–the State\ncould intervene because it had an “economic interest in the proper administration of the federal\n32\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 33 of 45 - Page ID # 236\ndisability programs.”  Id. at 1516.  The State argued that “disabled individuals who are denied\nbenefits because of the Secretary’s unlawful regulations are compelled to turn to state and local\npublic assistance programs upon which they would otherwise not have to depend,” which in turn\nincreases the costs of the state and local programs.  Id.  In response, the Secretary of the Department\nof Health and Human Services argued that this was “not a legally cognizable interest because the\nfederal disability programs are intended only to benefit disabled individuals, not to ease the state’s\npublic assistance costs.”  Id.  The court rejected the Secretary’s argument, noting that “the legislative\nhistory of the [federal] programs shows that one of Congress’ express purposes in establishing the\nprograms was in fact ‘to relieve state and local governments of the soaring costs of the existing\nprograms.’”  Id. (quoting City of New York v. Heckler, 578 F. Supp. 1109, 1121 (E.D.N.Y. 1984)).\nThus, “the State’s economic interest in the proper administration of federal disability benefits [was]\nadequate to support intervention.”  Id.  \nAlthough Dixon concerns intervention under Rule 24(a)(2), I shall assume, for the purposes\nof argument, that “the same reasons that support[ed] the State’s right to intervene” in Dixon would\nalso establish the State’s “standing to challenge the Secretary’s policies.”  Dixon, 589 F. Supp. at\n1516 n.7.13  Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that the court’s holding in Dixon should be applied\nhere.  Indeed, it seems to me that the connection between the Secretary’s actions and the alleged\neconomic injury to the State in Dixon is much more direct than the connection between the Rule and\nthe alleged threats to the State plaintiffs’ budgetary stability.  The court found in Dixon that the\nfederal programs at issue were intended to provide economic relief to state and local governments,\n13 But see Avery v. Heckler, 584 F. Supp. 3121, 316 n.3 (D. Mass. 1984) (“An intervenor\nneed not have the standing necessary to initiate the lawsuit.”)\n33\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 34 of 45 - Page ID # 237\nand therefore the State of New York’s interest in the proper administration of the federal disability\nbenefits program supported its intervention (and presumably its standing).  In contrast, here the State\nplaintiffs are not challenging a rule, regulation, program, or statute that is intended to provide states\nwith economic relief, or is otherwise concerned with states’ well-being.  Rather, they are challenging\na rule that may require non-grandfathered, non-exempted health plans to provide coverage for certain\ncontraceptive services for women, despite some employers’ and employees’ religious objections to\nsuch services.  Unlike the federal disability programs in Dixon, the Rule has no direct economic\nconnection with the State plaintiffs.  As explained above, a series of assumptions about third parties’\npossible responses to the Rule must be made before any connection can be drawn between the Rule\nand the State plaintiffs’ budgetary stability, and this connection is too attenuated and speculative to\nestablish standing.  \n   Like Dixon, Avery also involved a State’s attempt to intervene in a suit challenging the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services’ decisions to terminate individuals’ disability benefits.  See\n584 F. Supp. at 315.  In Avery, the court granted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ motion to\nintervene because the Commonwealth had an interest “in minimizing the number of terminated\nsocial security beneficiaries on its welfare rolls.”  584 F. Supp. at 316.  In so doing, the court noted\nthat the case involved challenges to “Title XVI (SSI),” which “replaced state-administered welfare\nprograms providing the same coverage” and was “inten[ded] to provide fiscal relief for state and\nlocal governments.”  Id.  The court also rejected the Secretary’s argument that the Commonwealth\n“has  not  demonstrated  that  its  injury  is  fairly  traceable  to  the  Secretary’s  allegedly  illegal\nterminations,” stating, \n34\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 35 of 45 - Page ID # 238\nThe chain of causation alleged by the Commonwealth . . . is not interrupted by “the\nindependent action of some third party not before the court.”  All the links of the\nchain  are  before  court:  the  Secretary  promulgates  regulations,  which  the\nCommonwealth implements, and which require the termination of benefits to some\nclaimants, some of whom turn to the Commonwealth for financial support.\nId. (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 42 (1976)) (citation\nomitted).  The court also distinguished Avery from Pennsylvania v. Kleppe, 533 F.2d 668 (D.C. Cir.\n1976), wherein a state was denied standing to sue in part because “nothing in the legislative history\nof the relevant statute indicated any concern for the well-being of states.”  548 F. Supp. at 316.  The\nreasons I have cited for distinguishing Dixon from the instant case are equally applicable to Avery.\nI agree with the defendants that Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Block, 771 F.2d 347 (8th Cir. 1985),\nis more instructive.  In Block, the State of Iowa sought to compel the Secretary of the Department\nof Agriculture “to implement three federal agricultural disaster relief programs.”  Id. at 348.  “In\nattempting to establish that it sustained an injury in fact,” Iowa alleged “that, but for the Secretary’s\nimplementation of these disaster relief programs, agriculture production will suffer, which will\ndislocate agriculturally-based industries, forcing unemployment up and state tax revenues down.  As\na result, the State will face increased responsibility for the welfare and support of its affected citizens\nwhile its available tax revenues are declining.”  Id. at 353.  The Eighth Circuit found that Iowa’s\n“alleged injury is insufficiently proximate to the actions at issue and the remedy to be offered by this\naction an insufficient guarantee of solvency to warrant state standing in this case.”  Id. at 354.  It\nseems to me that the connection between the Rule and the threat of budgetary strain for the State\nplaintiffs is at least as attenuated, if not more so, than the connection between Iowa’s alleged injury\nand the defendant’s actions in Block.  \n35\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 36 of 45 - Page ID # 239\nFinally, the plaintiffs argue that if I “first find[] that any of the individual or organization[al]\nPlaintiffs has standing, [I] need not determine whether Plaintiff States likewise have standing.”\n(Pls.’ Response Br. at 17, ECF No. 33.)  Because all of the other plaintiffs lack standing, this\nargument is moot.\nIn summary, I find that the plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to establish that the State\nplaintiffs have standing to sue in their own right.  There are no allegations of direct injuries resulting\nfrom the Rule; instead, the State plaintiffs only speculate that third parties will respond to the Rule\nin such a way that the States’ budgets will ultimately be strained.  As a result, the State plaintiffs\nmust be dismissed for lack of standing.\n2.     Prudential Standing Principles\nEven if the State plaintiffs were able to establish Article III standing, I would dismiss their\nclaims on the ground that they do not fall within the zone of interests protected by the First\nAmendment or RFRA.  \nApart from the constitutional requirements of standing, “the federal judiciary has also\nadhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.”  Valley Forge\nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474\n(1982).  For example, the Supreme Court “has required that the plaintiff’s complaint fall within ‘the\nzone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.’”\nId. at 475 (quoting Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S.\n150, 153, 1970)).  The Court has explained,\nAlthough standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff’s\ncontention that particular conduct is illegal, it often turns on the nature and source of\nthe claim asserted.  The actual or threatened injury required by Art. III may exist\n36\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 37 of 45 - Page ID # 240\nsolely by virtue of “statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates\nstanding . . . .”  Moreover, the source of the plaintiff’s claim to relief assumes critical\nimportance with respect to the prudential rules of standing that, apart from Art. III’s\nminimum requirements, serve to limit the role of the courts in resolving public\ndisputes.    Essentially,  the  standing  question  in  such  cases  is  whether  the\nconstitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be\nunderstood as granting persons in the plaintiff's position a right to judicial relief.\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975) (citations and footnote omitted).\nThe State plaintiffs claim to have standing to bring claims, in their own right, under the First\nAmendment’s  Free  Speech  Clause,  the  First  Amendment’s  Free  Exercise  Clause,  the  First\nAmendment’s Freedom of Association Clause, and RFRA.  The defendants argue persuasively that\nthese clauses and RFRA protect individual rights, not states’s rights, (see Defs.’ Br. at 26-27, 33-35,\nECF No. 31), and the plaintiffs have offered no resistance to the defendants’ argument, (see generally\nPls.’ Response Br., ECF No. 33.)  I take it that the point is conceded, and therefore the State\nplaintiffs’ claims are subject to dismissal on the alternate ground that they do not fall within the zone\nof interests protected by the relevant portions of the First Amendment and by RFRA.14\nD.     Whether the Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Ripe\nNone of the plaintiffs have established that Article III’s standing requirements have been met.\nTherefore, there is no case or controversy before me, and the remaining issues raised by the\ndefendants in support of their  motion to dismiss are moot.  Nevertheless, it merits mention that even\nif the plaintiffs were able to establish standing to sue, their claims are not ripe. \n14 The defendants argue that the State plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed pursuant to\nRule 12(b)(6) for the same reasons.  (See Defs.’ Br. at 33-35, ECF No. 31 (arguing that the State\nplaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because RFRA and the\nrelevant clauses of the First Amendment do not protect states).)  Although the State plaintiffs’\nlack of standing renders the defendants’ argument moot, I agree with the defendants that the State\nplaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n37\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 38 of 45 - Page ID # 241\nRipeness, or the question “whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to warrant\njudicial intervention,” “bears close affinity” to the issue of standing.  Warth, v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n499 n.10 (1975).  See also National Park Hospitality Association v. Dept. of Interior, 538 U.S. 803,\n808 (2003) (“The ripeness doctrine is ‘drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and\nfrom prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction . . . .” (citation omitted)).  Ripeness “is\na justiciability doctrine designed ‘to prevent courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication,\nfrom entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to\nprotect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized\nand its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.’”  National Park Hospitality\nAssociation, 538 U.S. at 807-08 (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49\n(1967), overruled on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977)).  To assess ripeness,\ncourts must “evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the\nparties of withholding court consideration.”  Id. at 808 (citing Abbot Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149).\nSee also Missouri Roundtable for Life v. Carnahan, 676 F.3d 665, 674 (8th Cir. 2012) (“In assessing\nripeness, we focus on whether the case involves ‘contingent future events that may not occur as\nanticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” (quoting 281 Care Committee v. Arneson, 638 F.3d\n621, 631 (8th Cir. 2011))).  \n“The fitness requirement is primarily meant to protect ‘the agency’s interest in crystalizing\nits policy before that policy is subjected to judicial review and the court’s interests in avoiding\nunnecessary adjudication and in deciding issues in a concrete setting.’” American Petroleum Institute\nv. EPA, No. 09-1038, 2012 WL 2053572, at *4 (D.C. Cir. June 8, 2012) (quoting Wyoming Outdoor\nCouncil v. U.S. Forest Service, 165 F.3d 43, 49 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).  “Among other things, then, the\n38\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 39 of 45 - Page ID # 242\nfitness issue ‘depends on whether it is purely legal, whether consideration of the issue would benefit\nfrom a more concrete setting, and whether the agency’s action is sufficiently final.”  Id. (quoting\nAtlantic States Legal Foundation v. EPA, 325 F.3d 281, 284 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).  “Courts decline to\nreview ‘tentative’ agency positions because doing so ‘severely compromises the interests the ripeness\ndoctrine protects: ‘The agency is denied the full opportunity to apply its expertise and to correct\nerrors or modify positions in the course of a proceeding, the integrity of the administrative process\nis threatened by piecemeal review of the substantive underpinnings of a rule, and judicial economy\nis disserved because judicial review might prove unnecessary if persons seeking such review are able\nto convince the agency to alter a tentative position.’”  Id. (citing Public Citizen Health Research\nGroup v. Commissioner, Food & Drug Administration, 740 F.2d 21, 31 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).  \nThe foregoing “institutional interests in the deferral of review” can be outweighed, however,\nif the deferral causes “immediate and significant” hardship.  American Petroleum Institute, 2012 WL\n2503572, at *6 (quoting Devia v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 492 F.3d 421, 427 (D.C. Cir.\n2007)).  However, “[c]onsiderations of hardship that might result from delaying review ‘will rarely\novercome the finality and fitness problems inherent in attempts to review tentative positions.’”  Id.\n(quoting Public Citizen Health Research Group, 740 F.2d at 31).  \nThe plaintiffs and defendants each argue that Abbot Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136\n(1967), overruled on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1997), supports their\nposition on the ripeness issue.  In Abbott Laboratories, the Supreme Court determined that a pre-\nenforcement challenge to Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulations was fit for judicial\ndetermination because the challenged regulation was “quite clearly definitive”; there was “no hint\nthat [the] regulation [was] informal, or only the ruling of a subordinate official, or tentative”; and\n39\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 40 of 45 - Page ID # 243\nthe regulation “was made effective upon publication.”  387 U.S. at 151.  As to the second prong of\nthe ripeness inquiry, the Court found that judicial consideration was warranted because, in addition\nto the foregoing factors, “compliance [with the regulations] was expected,” id. at 152, which “put[]\npetitioners in a dilemma”:\nIf petitioners wish to comply they must change all their labels, advertisements, and\npromotional materials; they must destroy stocks of printed matter; and they must\ninvest  heavily  in  new  printing  type  and  new  supplies.    The  alternative  to\ncompliance–continued use of material which they believe in good faith meets the\nstatutory requirements, but which clearly does not meet the regulation of the\nCommissioner–may be even more costly.  That course would risk serious criminal\nand civil penalties for the unlawful distribution of “misbranded” drugs.\nId. at 152-53.\nAs the plaintiffs correctly note, the fact that the complaint presents concrete legal questions\nfor review weighs in favor of justiciability.  See Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149.  In addition,\nI agree with the plaintiffs that the Rule should be considered “definitive” by virtue of its formal\npromulgation.  This fact carries limited significance, however, given the tentative nature of the\nDepartments’  position  on  religious  accommodations  to  the  ACA’s  contraceptive  coverage\nrequirements.  In other words, although the Rule does settle the definition of “religious employer”\nfor the purposes of the contraceptive coverage exemption, it also states that the contraceptive\ncoverage requirements will not be enforced until the Departments consider whether to adopt\nadditional, broader religious accommodations.  It seems to me that under these circumstances I\nshould decline to review the defendants’ tentative position on the scope of religious exemptions to\nthe contraceptive coverage requirements.  Adjudicating the plaintiffs’ claims now would deny the\nDepartments a full opportunity to modify their positions and undermine the interests of judicial\neconomy.  \n40\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 41 of 45 - Page ID # 244\nThis case is clearly distinguishable from Abbott Laboratories in important respects.  In\nAbbott Laboratories (and in other cases upon which the plaintiffs rely), there was a clear expectation\nof conformity with the challenged regulation.  See 387 U.S. at 151-52.  (See also Pls.’ Br. at 19, ECF\nNo. 33 (“When, as here, [regulations are promulgated . . . and the expected conformity to them\ncauses injury cognizable by a court of equity, they are appropriately the subject of attack.” (quoting\nAbbot Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 150 (emphasis added))); (“If ‘the enforcement of a statute is certain,\na pre-enforcement challenge will not be rejected on ripeness grounds.” (quoting Florida State\nConference of the NAACP v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1164 (11th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added))).)\nIn the instant case, in contrast, a temporary enforcement safe harbor prevents the Rule from being\nenforced against the plaintiffs until August 1, 2013.  Although the plaintiffs allege that the Rule will\n“absolutely” be enforced against them on that date, (see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 74, ECF No. 1; Pls.’ Br. at\n19, ECF No. 33), the Rule itself states that it will be amended during the safe harbor period to\naccommodate  religious  objections  to  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirements.    Indeed,  the\namendment process has already begun.  In other words, although the definition of “religious\nemployer” has been settled definitively, the contraceptive coverage requirements are not being\nenforced against non-grandfathered religious organizations that fail to satisfy that definition, and new\nmeans of accommodating the organizations are being contemplated.  Thus, the Rule’s impact upon\nthe plaintiffs is not “sufficiently direct and immediate” to warrant judicial intervention.  Abbott\nLaboratories, 387 U.S. at 152.\nThe plaintiffs argue that delaying judicial review would harm them because they must either\n“make  immediate  and  significant  changes  to  their  health  care  coverage  arrangements  in\ncontravention of their religious and moral beliefs” or “forgo health insurance altogether and face a\n41\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 42 of 45 - Page ID # 245\nsteep civil penalty in doing so.”  (Pls.’ Br. at 19, ECF No. 33.)  In fact, however, this forced choice\nis neither imminent nor inevitable in light of the temporary enforcement safe harbor and the\nANPRM.  \nRelatedly, the plaintiffs argue that the effects of the Rule are reaching them “now or in the\nimmediate or near future” because they “must start making plans now to comply with the Final Rule\nand any inability to offer health insurance coverage will have a severe impact on [the organizational\nplaintiffs’] ability to retain and recruit employees.”  (Pls.’ Response Br. at 20, ECF No. 33.)  The\ncomplaint includes no allegations stating that the plaintiffs must begin planning now to comply with\nthe Rule or that the Rule will affect the organizational plaintiffs’ employee retention and recruitment\nefforts.  Moreover, the plaintiffs’ desire to plan for future contingencies that may never arise does\nnot constitute the sort of hardship that can establish the ripeness of their claims,15 particularly given\nthe strength of the “institutional interests in the deferral of review” described above.  American\nPetroleum Institute, 2012 WL 2053572, at *6.  The complaint simply does not establish that the Rule\n15 The plaintiffs’ “hardship” argument is analogous to one rejected by the Seventh Circuit\nin Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. EPA, 536 F.2d 156, 162 (7th Cir. 1976).  There, petitioners argued\nthat the EPA’s designations of certain areas for pollution studies caused them “uncertainty in\ntheir business operations” for a number of reasons.  For instance, some petitioners argued that\nthey would have to maintain capital “to cover the possible expenditure of funds for pollution\ncontrol equipment” if the EPA issued more restrictive pollution requirements for the studied\nareas.  The Seventh Circuit distinguished these claims of uncertainty from the harms discussed in\nAbbott Laboratories, noting that the petitioners “need not expend any funds at this time since\nthere is no administrative directive to which they must comply,” the petitioners did not “face any\nsanctions for noncompliance,” and the alleged hardship did not have “the ‘direct effect on the\nday-to-day business’ of the petitioners which the Supreme Court found present in Abbott\nLaboratories.”  Bethlehem Steel Corp., 536 F.3d at 163.  Here, as in Bethlehem Steel Corp., the\nplaintiffs are not asked to comply with any contraception coverage requirements while\nrulemaking process continues, the plaintiffs face no sanctions for noncompliance with the\ncontraception coverage requirements, and their alleged planning hardship is neither alleged in the\ncomplaint nor as palpable as the dilemma described in Abbott Laboratories.   \n42\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 43 of 45 - Page ID # 246\nhas created the same sort of “direct and immediate” dilemma that confronted the petitioners in\nAbbott Laboratories. \nThe plaintiffs also argue that “the mere promise to take future action” to accommodate\nreligious objections to the contraceptive coverage requirements“ in “future rulemaking” cannot\ndefeat standing.  (Pls.’ Response Br. at 21, ECF No. 33.  See also id. at 20-22.)  I agree with the\nplaintiffs that the defendants cannot “stave off judicial review of a challenged rule simply by\ninitiating a new proposed rulemaking that would amend the rule in a significant way.”  American\nPetroleum Institute, 2012 WL 2503572, at *5.  “If that were true, a savvy agency could perpetually\ndodge review.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Here, however, the fact that the Rule itself describes the\ntemporary enforcement safe harbor and the new proposed rulemaking dispels the notion that the\ndefendants are engaged in review-evading gamesmanship.  The “definite end date” to the amendment\nprocess (i.e., August 1, 2013), “further alleviates any concern that [the defendants are] using a new\nrulemaking to evade review.”  American Petroleum Institute, 2012 WL 2503572, at *5.\nFinally, the plaintiffs argue that “the harms alleged by the individual and [organizational]\nPlaintiffs here are of a sort to which ripeness analysis is especially sensitive.”  (Pls.’ Response Br.\nat 23, ECF No. 33.)  More specifically, they argue that the ripeness analysis is “relaxed” in First\nAmendment cases.  (Id. (citing Kansas Judicial Review v. Stout, 519 F.3d 1107, 1116 (10th Cir.\n2008); Currence v. Cincinnati, 28 F. App’x 438, 441 (6th Cir. 2002)).)  It is true that “the chilling\neffect the challenged law may have on First Amendment liberties” merits consideration when a court\nassesses the ripeness of a claim.  Stout, 519 F.3d at 1116.  As explained previously, however, the\nplaintiffs in this case do not face a direct and immediate dilemma that involves the sacrifice of their\nFirst Amendment rights, and the defendants’ position on the scope of the exemptions to the\n43\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 44 of 45 - Page ID # 247\ncontraceptive coverage requirements is tentative–and under these circumstances, the plaintiffs cannot\nestablish ripeness even under a relaxed standard.16  \nIn summary, although the Rule that lies at the heart of the plaintiffs’ complaint establishes\na definitive, final definition of “religious employer,” the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirements\nare not being enforced against non-exempted religious organizations, and the Rule is currently\nundergoing a process of amendment to accommodate these organizations.  The plaintiffs face no\ndirect and immediate harm, and one can only speculate whether the plaintiffs will ever feel any\neffects from the Rule when the temporary enforcement safe harbor terminates.  This case clearly\ninvolves “contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,”\nMissouri Roundtable for Life v. Carnahan, 676 F.3d 665, 674 (8th Cir. 2012) (quoting 281 Care\nCommittee v. Arneson, 638 F.3d 621, 631 (8th Cir. 2011)), and therefore it is not ripe for review.\nNone of the plaintiffs have established that they have standing to challenge the Rule, and\neven if I were to assume that they did have standing, their claims are not ripe.  \n16 In Stout, the plaintiffs had a legitimate fear of sanctions for their political actions\nbecause the Kansas Commission on Judicial Qualifications did not “affirmative[ly] disavow . . .\nan intention to prosecute” candidates for state judicial office for taking certain actions prohibited\nunder the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct.  See 519 F.3d at 1118.  In Currence the court\ndetermined that it was likely that the plaintiff would be injured by the city’s nudity ban, that the\nissue of whether the nudity ban violated the First Amendment was ready for judicial\ndetermination, and that the plaintiff faced a “direct and immediate dilemma in how to conduct his\ndance routine within the boundaries of the law.”  28 F. App’x at 441-42.  Here, in contrast, the\ndefendants have declared that religious employers will not be required to provide contraceptive\ncoverage during the temporary enforcement safe harbor; new religious accommodations are\nbeing considered; and the plaintiffs are not facing a direct and immediate dilemma about whether\nto sacrifice their First Amendment rights in order to conform with the contraceptive coverage\nrequirements.\n44\n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 38   Filed: 07/17/12   Page 45 of 45 - Page ID # 248\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the defendants’ motion to dismiss, ECF No. 30, is\ngranted, and the plaintiffs’ complaint is dismissed without prejudice.  \nDated July 17, 2012.\nBY THE COURT\n____________________________________________\nWarren K.

GEITHNER, in his official capacity as the Secretary of the Treasury; \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (“DOL”); and HILDA L. SOLIS, in her \nofficial capacity as the Secretary of DOL (collectively, the “Federal Government”), and \nstate: \nBACKGROUND \n \n1.  In this action, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of a regulation \npromulgated by the Federal Government which would coerce religious organizations, \ninstitutions, care providers, outreach groups, and social service agencies, among others, \nto directly subsidize contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services in \ncontravention with their religious beliefs. \n3 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 4 of 27 - Page ID # 4\n2.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the free \nexercise of religion and the freedom of speech by forbidding the Federal Government \nfrom directing individuals and organizations to subsidize, promote, or affirm products, \nservices, and activity in direct contravention with the tenets of their religious faith. \n3.  The  First  Amendment  has,  for  centuries,  served  as  a  rampart  against \ngovernment interference with religious liberty.   \n4.  The Federal Government’s regulation, which Plaintiffs challenge herein, \nwould  break  through  that  rampart  and  leave  countless  additional  religious  freedoms \nvulnerable to government intrusion and negation through coercion. \n5.  The Federal Government’s regulation is an unprecedented invasion of the \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to free speech, free exercise of religion, and free \nassociation. \n6.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs ask this Court to find the Federal Government’s \nregulation unconstitutional as a direct violation of the First Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nand § 1361 because this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates.  This Court has jurisdiction to render declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201 and §2202 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb. \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(c) \nbecause no real property is involved, Plaintiffs State of Nebraska, Sister Mary Catherine, \n4 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 5 of 27 - Page ID # 5\nCK,  Stacy  Molai,  Catholic  Social  Services,  Pius  X  High  School,  and  The  Catholic \nMutual  Relief  Society  of  America  are  located  in  Nebraska  and  the  defendants  are \nagencies of the United States or officers thereof acting in their official capacity.  \nPARTIES \n \n9.  The State of Nebraska is a sovereign state and protector of the individual \nfreedom, public health, and welfare of its citizens and residents.  Jon Bruning, Attorney \nGeneral of Nebraska, has been directly elected by the people of Nebraska to serve as their \nchief legal officer and exercises broad statutory and common law authority to protect the \nrights of the State of Nebraska and its people.  The State, by and through the Attorney \nGeneral, has standing to assert the unconstitutionality of the Rule.  He is authorized to \nappear for the State and prosecute and defend any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in \nwhich the State may be a party or interested.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 84-203.  \n10.  The  State  of  South  Carolina,  by  and  through  Alan  Wilson,  Attorney \nGeneral of South Carolina, is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \n11.  Bill Schuette, Attorney General of Michigan, is bringing this action on \nbehalf of the People of Michigan under Mich. Comp. Law § 14.28, which provides that \nthe Michigan Attorney General may “appear for the people of [Michigan] in any other \ncourt or tribunal,  in  any  cause or matter, civil  or criminal,  in  which  the people of \n[Michigan] may be a party or interested.” Under Michigan’s constitution, the people are \nsovereign.  Mich.  Const.  art.  I,  §  1  (“All  political  power  is  inherent  in  the  people. \nGovernment is instituted for their equal benefit, security, and protection.”). \n5 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 6 of 27 - Page ID # 6\n12.  The State of Texas, by and through Greg Abbott, Attorney General of \nTexas, is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \n13.  The State of Florida, by and through Pam Bondi, Attorney General of \nFlorida, is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \n14.  The State of Ohio, by and through Michael DeWine, Attorney General of \nOhio, is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \n15.  The State of Oklahoma, by and through Scott Pruitt, Attorney General of \nOklahoma, is a sovereign state in the United States of America. \n16.   Plaintiff  Sister  Mary  Catherine,  CK  is  an  individual  Catholic  nun \naffiliated with the School Sisters of Christ the King, a Catholic order located in Lincoln, \nNebraska. \n17.  Sister Mary Catherine is covered by a health insurance plan with Blue \nCross Blue Shield of Nebraska through the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska. \n18.  Health  Insurance  coverage  of  services  for  purposes  of  contraception, \nabortifacients, or sterilization is in contravention with Sister Mary Catherine’s religious \nbeliefs. \n19.  Sister  Mary  Catherine’s  health  insurance  plan  has  been  specifically \ncontracted  for  to  exclude  coverage  for  purposes  of  contraception,  abortifacients, \nsterilization, and related services. \n20.  Sister Mary Catherine will drop her private health insurance coverage if \nretaining such coverage would result in the subsidization of contraception, abortifacients, \nsterilization, and related services. \n6 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 7 of 27 - Page ID # 7\n21.  Sister Mary Catherine’s current health insurance plan is not grandfathered \nfrom ACA requirements; accordingly, her plan is subject to the Rule’s contraceptive \ncoverage requirements immediately upon the Rule taking effect. \n22.  Plaintiff  Stacy  Molai  is  a  Catholic  individual  residing  in  Omaha, \nNebraska. \n23.  Molai is a Catholic missionary employed by the Fellowship of Catholic \nUniversity  Students  (“FOCUS”),  a  Catholic  organization  engaged  in  ministry  and \noutreach on college campuses throughout the United States and around the world. \n24.  Molai is covered by a health insurance plan with Cigna through FOCUS. \n25.  Coverage  of  services  for  purposes  of  contraception,  abortifacients, or \nsterilization is in contravention with Molai’s religious beliefs. \n26.  Molai’s  health  insurance  plan  has  been  specifically  contracted  for  to \nexclude coverage for purposes of contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related \nservices. \n27.  Molai suffers from an incurable chronic illness which requires substantial \nongoing care. \n28.  Molai’s condition requires her to incur medical care and supply costs of \n$300 to $400 per month. \n29.  Molai’s condition occasionally necessitates hospitalization and surgery.  \nEach such occurrence incurs costs of $3,000 to $5,000 per event. \n30.  Health insurance coverage is critical to Molai in order to avoid financial \nruin and possibly life threatening consequences.  However, she would drop such coverage \n7 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 8 of 27 - Page ID # 8\nif it would result in her subsidization of contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and \nrelated services. \n31.  Molai’s  current  health  insurance  plan  is  grandfathered  from  ACA \nrequirements. \n32.  Upon which time Molai or her employer, FOCUS, substantially changes \nany aspect of Molai’s health insurance plan, Molai’s plan will immediately become \nsubject to ACA requirements and the contraceptive coverage Rule promulgated pursuant \nthereto. \n33.  Since  the  ACA’s  grandfathering  exemption  does  not  apply  to  health \ninsurance plans which substantially change after March 23, 2010, Molai is trapped in her \ncurrent plan if she wishes to remain grandfathered from ACA requirements. \n34.  Plaintiff Catholic Social Services, a Nebraska non-profit corporation, is a \nfaith-based charity services provider and is a Catholic religious organization employer \nlocated in Lincoln, Nebraska, Hastings, Nebraska, and other cities. \n35.  Catholic Social Services is an affiliated entity of the Catholic Diocese of \nLincoln, Nebraska providing social charity to persons in southern Nebraska including \nhousing, food, clothing, financial, refugee, emergency, and other services. \n36.  Catholic  Social  Services  employs  individuals  who  seek  a  structured, \nsystematic  formation  program  centered  on  the  Catholic  faith  and  has more  than  50 \npersons on staff.  \n8 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 9 of 27 - Page ID # 9\n37.  Catholic Social Services’ purpose is to serve persons of all religious and \nethnic backgrounds and is not limited in its provision of services to person who share its \nreligious tenets.  \n38.  Though Catholic Social Services exists and conducts its ministry pursuant \nto  a  religiously-rooted  sense  of  purpose,  mission,  and  duty,  its  primary  operational \npurpose is not the inculcation of religious values.  \n39.  Catholic Social Services is covered by a health insurance plan with Blue \nCross Blue Shield of Nebraska through the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska.  \n40.  Health  insurance  coverage  of  services  for  purposes  of  contraception, \nabortifacients, or sterilization is in contravention with Catholic teaching and doctrine \nadhered to and followed by Catholic Social Services. \n41.  Catholic  Social  Services’  health  insurance  plan  has  been  specifically \ncontracted  for  to  exclude  coverage  for  purposes  of  contraception,  abortifacients, \nsterilization, and related services.  \n42.  Catholic Social Services will drop its private health insurance coverage if \nretaining such coverage would result in its subsidization of services for purposes of \ncontraception, abortifacients, sterilization, or related services. \n43.  Catholic  Social  Services’  current  health  insurance  plan  is  not \ngrandfathered from ACA requirements; accordingly, its plan is subject to the Rule’s \ncontraceptive coverage requirements immediately upon the Rule taking effect.  \n9 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 10 of 27 - Page ID # 10\n44.  Plaintiff Pius X Catholic High School (“Pius X”) is a Nebraska non-profit \ncorporation and is the sole Catholic high school for the City of Lincoln and the Diocese \nof Lincoln, Nebraska with an enrollment of more than 1,000 students in grades 9-12. \n45.  Pius X employs more than 70 faculty and staff. \n46.  Pius X is dedicated to a Christ-centered education that integrates Catholic \nvalues in all areas of life and providing academic preparation of the highest quality in a \ndisciplined environment.  \n47.  Pius X is covered by a health insurance plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield \nof Nebraska through the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska.  \n48.  Health insurance coverage for purposes of contraception, abortifacients, \nsterilization, or other services is in contravention with Catholic teaching and doctrine \nadhered to and followed by Pius X. \n49.  Pius X’s health insurance plan has been specifically contracted for to \nexclude coverage for purposes of contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related \nservices.  \n50.  Pius X’s current health insurance plan is not grandfathered from ACA \nrequirements;  accordingly,  its  plan  is  subject  to  the  Rule’s  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirements immediately upon the Rule taking effect.  \n51.  Plaintiff  The  Catholic  Mutual  Relief  Society  of  America  (“Catholic \nMutual”) is a non-profit religious 501 (c)(3) organization with its principle place of \nbusiness located in Omaha, Nebraska. \n10 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 11 of 27 - Page ID # 11\n52.  Catholic  Mutual  provides  health  coverage  to  its  employees  through  a \ngroup health plan. \n53.  Catholic  Mutual  is  an  equal  opportunity  employer  who  seeks  highly-\nqualified  and  driven  employees  and  does  not  primarily  employ  persons  who  share \nCatholic Mutual’s religious tenets. \n54.  Catholic Mutual does not inquire as to the religious affiliation or beliefs of \nprospective employees. \n55.  Although Catholic Mutual exists and conducts its operations pursuant to a \nreligious-rooted  sense  of  purpose,  mission,  and  duty,  Catholic  Mutual’s  primary \noperational purpose is not the inculcation of religious values. \n56.  Catholic Mutual does not include coverage of services for purposes of \ncontraception, abortifacients, or sterilization in its employees’ health insurance plans. \n57.  Coverage  of  services  for  purposes  of  contraception,  abortifacients, or \nsterilization  is  in  contravention  with  Catholic  teaching  and  doctrine  adhered  to  and \nfollowed by Catholic Mutual. \n58.  Catholic Mutual’s employees are not offered supplemental insurance plans \nto cover contraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services in connection \nwith their primary employer-subsidized health care plans. \n59.  Catholic Mutual’s health insurance plan for its own employees is currently \ngrandfathered from ACA’s requirements.   \n11 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 12 of 27 - Page ID # 12\n60.  Since  the  ACA’s  grandfathering  exemption  does  not  apply  to  health \ninsurance plans which substantially change after March 23, 2010, Catholic Mutual is \ntrapped in its current plan if it wishes to remain grandfathered from ACA requirements. \n61.  Catholic Mutual comprehensively evaluates its employee health plan on \nan annual basis. \n62.  If Catholic Mutual substantially changes certain aspects of its employee \nhealth  insurance  plan,  Catholic  Mutual  will  immediately  become  subject  to  ACA \nrequirements and the contraceptive coverage Rule promulgated pursuant thereto. \n63.  Defendant HHS is an agency of the United States, and is responsible for \nadministration and enforcement of the Rule. \n64.  Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is Secretary of HHS, and is named as a party \nin her official capacity. \n65.  Defendant Treasury is an agency of the United States, and is responsible \nfor administration and enforcement of the Rule. \n66.  Defendant Timothy F. Geithner is Secretary of the Treasury, and is named \nas a party in his official capacity. \n67.  Defendant DOL is an agency of the United States, and is responsible for \nadministration and enforcement of the Rule. \n68.  Defendant Hilda L. Solis is Secretary of DOL, and is named as a party in \nher official capacity. \n \n \n12 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 13 of 27 - Page ID # 13\nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n69.  On February 15, 2012, final rules under a heading titled “Group Health \nPlans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services under the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (collectively, the “Rule”) were promulgated \nby  the  Federal  Government,  ostensibly  pursuant  to  its  statutory  authority  under  the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, as amended by the \nHealth Care and Education Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152 (ACA).  77 Fed. Reg. 31, \n8725. \n70.  The Rule was definitively and formally promulgated by publication in the \nFederal Register as a “Final Rule;” there is no hint that the Rule is informal, tentative, \nthat it is only the ruling of a subordinate official, or that full compliance with the Rule is \nnot expected.  77 Fed. Reg. 31, 8725. \n71.  Five days prior to formal publication of the Rule in the Federal Register, \nHHS  unilaterally  issued  non-regulatory  Guidance  ostensibly  claiming  the  Federal \nGovernment will abide by a “temporary enforcement safe harbor” for the Rule until the \nfirst plan year that begins on or after August 1, 2013.  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices,  U.S.  Dept.  of  Health  &  Human  Services,  Guidance  on  the  Temporary \nEnforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans and Group Health \nInsurance Issuers  with Respect  to  the Requirement  to  Cover Contraceptive Services \nWithout Cost Sharing Under Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section \n715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the \nInternal  Revenue  Code,  Feb.  10,  2012  (the  “Guidance”)  (available  at \n13 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 14 of 27 - Page ID # 14\nhttp://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/Files2/02102012/20120210-Preventive-Services-\nBulletin.pdf). \n72.  Notwithstanding  the  Federal  Government’s  unilateral  imposition  of  a \n“one-year safe harbor from enforcement” of the Rule, Plaintiffs are at risk of imminent \nand irreparable injury from the operation of the Rule upon its effective date of April 16, \n2012.   \n73.  No discernible statutory or regulatory obstacle exists barring the Federal \nGovernment from unilaterally withdrawing its promise of a “one-year safe harbor from \nenforcement” of the Rule, upon which time Plaintiffs would suffer immediate irreparable \nharm; accordingly, this Court enjoys the authority to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ claims now. \n74.  Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ ability or inability to qualify for the Federal \nGovernment’s unilateral promise of a “one-year safe harbor from enforcement” of the \nRule, Plaintiffs will absolutely be required to comply upon the expiration of the safe \nharbor on August 1, 2013. \n75.  The Rule represents  an unprecedented encroachment on the liberty of \nindividuals, like Plaintiffs Sister Mary Catherine, CK, and Molai, residing in Plaintiffs’ \nStates, by mandating  that all  non-exempt religious  organization employers subsidize \ncoverage for contraceptives, sterilization, and related patient education and counseling.  \nThe subsidization of such services is contrary to Plaintiffs Sister Mary Catherine, CK’s  \nand Molai’s religious beliefs.   \n76.  As a result of the Rule’s compulsory violation of Plaintiff Sister Mary \nCatherine, CK’s religious beliefs, Plaintiff Sister Mary Catherine, CK, who has health \n14 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 15 of 27 - Page ID # 15\ninsurance, will opt out for moral and religious reasons. Provided no other options than \nMedicaid or the state-based health insurance exchange, which also will provide coverage \nconflicting with her beliefs, Plaintiff Sister Mary Catherine, CK will be forced to pay \ncivil penalties and forego health insurance altogether.  \n77.  The Rule represents  an unprecedented encroachment on the liberty of \nreligious organization employers, including Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X \nCatholic High School, and Catholic Mutual, operating in Plaintiffs’ States, by mandating \nthat  Plaintiffs  Catholic  Social  Services,  Pius  X  High  School,  and  Catholic  Mutual \nsubsidize coverage for contraceptives, sterilization, and related patient education and \ncounseling.   \n78.  The Rule’s religious employer exemption is insufficiently narrow as it \nfails to cover a significant number of religious organizations who do not “primarily \nserve… persons who share [their] religious tenets”, do not “primarily employ persons \nwho share their religious tenets”, or do not have “the inculcation of religious values” as \ntheir primary operational purpose.   \n79.  Were Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High School, \nand Catholic Mutual to attempt to gain the religious employer exemption, it would be \nnecessary  for  Catholic  Social  Services,  Pius  X  Catholic  High  School,  and  Catholic \nMutual  to  begin  inquiring  into  the  religious  affiliation  and  beliefs  of  prospective \nemployees – a practice in which Catholic Social Services and Catholic Mutual currently \ndo not currently engage. \n15 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 16 of 27 - Page ID # 16\n80.  Plaintiff Pius X Catholic High School has previously, in the context of \ncertain generally applicable employer mandates promulgated by the Federal Government, \nenjoyed the certainty of broad religious employer exemptions which protected Pius X \nCatholic High School from being directed to take or subsidize action in contravention \nwith Catholic teaching and doctrine adhered to and followed by Pius X Catholic High \nSchool. \n81.  Due  to  the  insufficiently  narrow  nature  of  the  religious  employer \nexemption to the Rule challenged herein, Plaintiffs, including Pius X  Catholic High \nSchool, face great uncertainty in determining whether they will enjoy the same religious \nemployer exemptions from government mandates as they have in the past. \n82.  In the event Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High \nSchool, and Catholic Mutual’s health insurance plans are no longer grandfathered plans, \nthe Federal Government has provided two ways in which Plaintiffs can circumvent the \nRule’s requirements: declining to provide health insurance altogether and face a stiff per-\nemployee penalty or satisfying all of the criteria to qualify for a “religious employer” \nexemption. \n83.  Plaintiffs  are  not  eligible  for  the  Federal  Government’s  insufficiently \nnarrow religious employer exemption to the Rule, based on the Federal Government’s \nstated intent to exclude hospitals, schools, and universities and because Plaintiffs do not \nclearly satisfy all of the exemption’s rigid conjunctive requirements. \n84.  As a result of the Rule’s compulsory violation of religious organization \nemployers’ religious beliefs, religious organization employers in Plaintiff States, such as \n16 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 17 of 27 - Page ID # 17\nPlaintiffs Catholic Social Services and Catholic Mutual, may simply cease the provision \nof  health  insurance  coverage  to  their  employees,  rather  than  subsidize  conduct  and \nservices in violation of their beliefs. \n85.  If  religious  organization  employers  were  to  cease  provision  of  health \ninsurance in order to avoid the requirements of the Rule, an immediate and substantial \nspike in the number of enrollments in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs would result, \nas many impacted employees would invariably shift to Medicaid to remain in compliance \nwith the ACA’s individual coverage mandate. \n86.  Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs are already facing the acute strain of \ndramatically  increased  enrollments  due  to  the  ACA’s  individual  coverage  mandate.  \nForcing another round of enrollments will compound this problem and further threaten \nPlaintiff States’ budgetary stability.   \n87.  In addition, religious organization employers operating in Plaintiffs States \nwill cease providing charitable services to persons who do not share their religious tenets, \nin an effort to qualify under the Religious Employer Exemption.  Those people no longer \nserved  by  such  charitable  services  will  place  further  pressure  on  Plaintiff  States’ \nMedicaid programs as they inevitably increase reliance on public resources for support.   \n88.  To  the  extent  Plaintiffs  are  currently  grandfathered  from  ACA \nrequirements and the contraceptive coverage Rule promulgated pursuant thereto, those \nPlaintiffs  are  effectively  trapped  in  their  current  plans  if  they  wish  to  remain \ngrandfathered; any substantial modification of their health insurance plans will bring \nthem under the ACA’s requirements and the Rule’s contraceptive coverage coercion. \n17 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 18 of 27 - Page ID # 18\n89.  Given that the Federal Government itself has conceded that employers and \nindividuals will inevitably find it necessary to make substantial modifications to health \ninsurance  plans,  particularly  in  light  of  spiraling  costs  and  a  fluctuating  regulatory \nenvironment, it is readily apparent that currently-grandfathered Plaintiffs will lose their \nexemption from ACA requirements in the foreseeable future; it is unrealistic to presume \nthey can remain grandfathered in perpetuity. \n90.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT ONE \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT  \nFREE SPEECH CLAUSE \n(First Amendment to the United States Constitution)  \n91.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt,  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  preceding \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n92.  The compelled subsidization of beliefs, with which Plaintiffs do not agree, \nviolates the freedom of speech provided by the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n93.  The  Rule  further  violates  the  First  Amendment  because  it  compels \nPlaintiffs to subsidize conduct in violation of their moral and religious beliefs. \n94.  The Rule also violates the First Amendment by prohibiting Plaintiffs from \nexpressing a message in accordance with their beliefs. \n \n \n18 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 19 of 27 - Page ID # 19\nCOUNT TWO \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT  \nFREE EXERCISE CLAUSE \n(First Amendment to the United States Constitution) \n \n95.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt,  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  preceding \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n96.  The Rule violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by \nnegating the right of Plaintiffs to act in accordance with their beliefs. \n97.  Defendants  have  created  categorical  exemptions  and  individualized \nexemptions to the Rule. \n98.  The Rule furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n99.  The Rule is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n100.  The Rule imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n101.  The Rule coerces Plaintiffs to change or violate their religious beliefs. \n102.  The Rule chills Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.  \n103.  The Rule exposes Plaintiffs to substantial fines for its religious exercise. \n104.  The Rule violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by \nnegating  the  right  of  Plaintiffs  to  freely  practice  their  religious  beliefs  without \ngovernment interference. \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 20 of 27 - Page ID # 20\nCOUNT THREE \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT  \nFREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION CLAUSE \n(First Amendment to the United States Constitution) \n \n105.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  preceding \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n106.  The  Rule  violates  the  Freedom  of  Association  Clause  of  the  First \nAmendment  by  negating  the  rights  of  Plaintiffs  to  organize  voluntary  religious \nassociations by forcing Plaintiffs to associate with an ideology that violates their religious \nbeliefs.  \n107.  The  Rule  violates  the  Freedom  of  Association  Clause  of  the  First \nAmendment  by  negating  the  rights  of  Plaintiffs  to  organize  voluntary  religious \nassociations that serve persons of other beliefs.  \nCOUNT FOUR \n \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT \n(42 U.S.C. § 2000bb)  \n108.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt,  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  preceding \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n109.  The Rule works a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’ ability to freely \npractice their religion, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”).  \n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb. \n110.  The Rule chills Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n111.  The Rule exposes Plaintiffs to substantial fines for its religious exercise. \n20 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 21 of 27 - Page ID # 21\n112.  The Rule’s “religious employer” exemption violates RFRA because the \nexemption would require the government to troll through an organization’s religious \nbeliefs to determine whether the organization is religious enough to be exempt from the \nRule’s dictates. \n113.  The Rule furthers no compelling governmental interest and is not narrowly \ntailored to any compelling governmental interest. \n114.  The Rule is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ stated \ninterests. \n115.  The Rule’s compulsory funding of contraceptives is a substantial burden \nupon the Plaintiffs because it impermissibly interferes in matters of church faith and \ndoctrine. \n116.  The  Rule  puts  substantial  pressure  on  religious  adherents  to  modify \nreligious beliefs and behavior in order to comply with the Rule’s mandates. \n117.  The  Rule  is  a  substantial  burden  on  the  rights  of  Plaintiffs  to  freely \nexercise religion because it forces them to subsidize contraceptives in violation of their \nreligious beliefs. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \nA.  Declare  the  Rule  to  be  in  violation  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the \nConstitution of the United States; \nB.  Declare  the  Rule  to  be  unlawful  pursuant  to  the  Religious  Freedom \nRestoration Act; \n21 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 22 of 27 - Page ID # 22\nC.  Declare Defendants to have violated the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, as \naforesaid; \nD.  Enjoin Defendants and any other agency or employee acting on behalf of \nthe  United  States  from  enforcing  the  Rule  against  the  Plaintiffs,  their  citizens  and \nresidents, and any of their agencies or officials or employees, and to take such actions as \nare necessary and proper to remedy their violations deriving from any such actual or \nattempted enforcement; and \nE.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, and grant such \nother relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nCOUNT FIVE \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n(28 U.S.C. § 2201) \n118.  Plaintiffs,  including  State  Plaintiffs  whose  Medicaid  and  regulatory \nresponsibilities will be severely affected by the Rule,  reallege, adopt, and incorporate by \nreference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n119.  There is an actual controversy of sufficient immediacy and concreteness \nrelating to the legal rights and duties of the Plaintiffs and their legal relations with the \nDefendants to warrant relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  \n120.  The harm to the Plaintiffs as a direct result of the Rule is sufficiently real \nand imminent to warrant the issuance of a conclusive declaratory judgment clarifying the \nlegal relations of the parties.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n22 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-CRZ   Doc # 1   Filed: 02/23/12   Page 23 of 27 - Page ID # 23\nA.

Plaintiffs’ Complaint (“Compl.”), at \n¶¶ 1, 70 (doc. 1).  By its  explicit terms, the Final Rule  does not accommodate the religious \nbeliefs of religious organizations that do not restrict their services primarily to people who share \ntheir religious tenets, or that do not restrict employment primarily to people who share their \nreligious  tenets, or that do not  have  “the inculcation of reli gious  values” as th eir  primary \noperational purpose. Id. at 78.  The Final Rule is unconstitutional and also violates the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act.  See U.S. Constitution, Amend. 1; 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb.  It also will \nhave the effect of causing individua ls and institutions to drop their health care coverage, and of \ncausing religious organization employers to restrict services to people who share their religious \nfaith.  See, e.g., Compl. at ¶¶ 20, 30, 41, 76. \nIn response to P laintiffs’ Complaint,  Defendants have brought  a Motion to Dism iss \npursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, accompanied by \na Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (“Def. Mem.”), at 32 (doc. \n31).  Defendants make no effort in these filings to defend the constitutionality of their Final Rule. \nRather, starting on page 1 of their Mem orandum, and continuing for some 30 pages, they center \ntheir defense on an ethereal and undefined promise of some future action to reform their conduct \nto “address religious concerns such as those raised by plaintiffs in this case.”  Def. Mem . at 1.  \nAmong other things, Defendants argue that their “Final Rule” is not all that final; that the federal \ngovernment will correct its positio n at some future point; that  having failed appropriately to \n1 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 10 of 37 - Page ID # 147\naccommodate the religious beliefs of the non-State Plaintiffs in their Final Rule, their promise to \ndo so by means of some unspecified future action should be viewed nonetheless as dispositive of \nand fatal to Plaintiffs’ case; and th at these Plaintiffs should not at th is stage be permitted to \nadvance the important religious liberty issues impli cated here.  In the course of th at argument, \nDefendants  stand ripeness analysis on its h ead  by arguing that undefined and conjectural \ncontingencies posited as a defense can render a claim  nonjusticiable, while also seeking to alter \npleading standards by disputing (without cited founda tion) factual allegations of the Complaint.  \nDefendants’ analysis also ignores the particular First Amendment context of this case.  For the \nfollowing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \nBACKGROUND \nIn this action, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of a regulation promulgated by the \nU.S. Departments of Health and H uman Services, Labor, and the Treasu ry (collectively, the \n“Federal Government”) that would coerce relig ious organizations, institutions, care providers, \noutreach groups, and social service agencies, am ong others, to directly subsidize contraception, \nabortifacients, sterilization, and  related services in contraventi on with their relig ious beliefs. \nSuch coercion – which would direct individuals  and organizations to subsidize, prom ote, or \naffirm products, services, and activ ity in direct contravention with  the tenets of  their religious \nfaith – is forbidden by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects the \nfree exercise of religion and the freedom of speech. \n Important and venerable constitutional principles protecting religious liberty are at stake \nin  this case. Should the Fede ral  Government’s  Final Rule  be  upheld, countle ss  additional \nreligious freedoms would be vulnerable to government intrusion and negation through coercion. \n2 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 11 of 37 - Page ID # 148\nIt is in that context that Plaintiffs object to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and ask this Court to \noverrule it. \nThe  Final Rules on Group Health Plans and  Health  Insurance Is suers  Relating to \nCoverage of Preventive Services U nder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \n“Final Rule”), 77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012) (to  be codified at 26 C.F.R. Pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. \nPt. 2590; 45 C.F.R. Pt. 147 and the a mendments thereto), promulgated pursuant to the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care  Act (“ACA”), are federal m andates that require all em ployers \nthat  provide  health in surance  to  their em ployees  to include   coverage for contracep tives, \nsterilization,  and related pa tient  education and counseling. 1  However, the provision of \ncontraceptives, sterilization, and  related patient education and couns eling is in direct conflict \nwith  the  religious  beliefs  of  certain  religious  organization employers  and individuals.   See \nCompl. at ¶¶ 18, 25, 40, 48, 57. The Final Rule for ces organization Plaintiffs Catholic Social \nServices, Pius X Catholic High School, and Cathol ic Mutual and individual Plaintiffs Sister \nMary Catherine and Stacy Molai to choose between  religious observance and the violation of a  \nregulatory mandate.  \nUnder the Final Rule, there are two ways in which religious organization employers may \ncircumvent the requirement to cover contracep tives: by declining to provide health insurance \naltogether  (and  incurring  substantial civ il  penalties  as a result) or b y  satisfying  all  of the \nfollowing criteria to qualify for the “religious employer” exemption: \n(1) The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization. \n(2) The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of \nthe organization. \n(3) The organization serves primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the \norganization. \n                                                            \n1 “Final Rule” refers only to the requirement to cover contraceptives, abortifacients, sterilization, and related patient \neducation and counseling; not the entire list of preventive services for women.  Additionally, the relief requested \nfrom HHS applies to all three departments that issued the interim final rule.  \n3 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 12 of 37 - Page ID # 149\n(4) The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(1) \nand section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended. \n \n76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46626 (Aug. 3, 2011) (“Religious Employer Exemption”).   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW, AND DEFENDANTS’ ASSERTION OF UNSPECIFIED \nPLANNED CORRECTIVE ACTION \n \n  In assessing Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court must “accept as true the factual \nallegations” of the Complaint.  Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York , 130 S. Ct. 983, 986-87 \n(2010), citing Leatherman v. Tarrant Co. Na rcotics Intell. & Coord. U nit, 507 U.S. 163, 164 \n(1993).  A com plaint that states  “a plausible claim for relief su rvives a motion to dismiss.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  A com plaint need not set forth detailed factual \nallegations, but must make a ‘“showing,’ rather than a blanket assertion, of entitlement to relief;” \nit must provide “some factual allegation” to provide “fair notice” of the claim and the “grounds” \non which it rests.   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544, 555, n. 3 (2009).  And o f \ncourse, “Rule 12(b)(6) does not co untenance … dismissals based on a judge’s disbelief of a  \ncomplaint’s factual allegations.”  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989). \nIn this case, it should be noted from the st art that Defendants purport not only to be on \nnotice of and to understand Plaintiffs’ claims, they also assert that they will take future action “to \naddress religious concerns such as  those raised by plaintiffs in  this case,” and they promise to \nundertake “amendments to the challenged regulations to accommodate the religious objections of \norganizations like the organization  plaintiffs.”  Def. Me m. at 1, 2-3.   The gravam en of this \ndefense is that Defendants appreciate and understa nd Plaintiffs’ claims so well that they can be  \nrelied upon to remedy the problem even absent further Court proceedings.  Because Defendants \nhave not specified or committed to any particular such amendment, however, there exists no \nstandard against which to judge this formless defense representation.  The rule now on the books \n4 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 13 of 37 - Page ID # 150\nis the Final Rule, and it is tha t Rule that the allegations in the Complaint address.  Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss the Complaint should be asse ssed under a standard recognizing that:  “A \nclaim has facial plau sibility when the plaintiff pleads factual c ontent that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678.  It will be for the Court to judge whether that plausibility exists in this context where \nDefendants aver by way of defense that they “inte nd[ ] to address the very  issue that plaintiffs \nraise in this case” through “forthcoming” remedial activity.  See Def. Mem. at 29. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE ORGANIZATION AND INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING \nTO PURSUE THEIR CLAIMS. \n \nDefendants have argued Plaintiffs lack st anding because they do not face immi nent \ninjury. However, the organizational and individual Plaintiffs face an imminent decision to either \ncompromise their religious beliefs or violate th e law. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have standing to \npursue their claim. Moreover, and because Defendants merge ripeness arguments into their \nattack  on standing,  see,  e.g.,  Def.  Mem.  at 16 (“In light of   the forthcom ing  [unspecified] \namendments, … there is  no reason to suspect th at the organization plaintiffs will be required \n[after those unspecified changes] to sponsor a hea lth plan that covers contraceptive services in \ncontravention  of their religious beliefs”), 19 (“ by  that time,  defendants  will have finalized \namendments … that will accommodate … religious objections. …  Those amendments are likely \nto affect the individual plaintiffs as well, by  providing them with a mechanism ….”), Plaintiffs \nare constrained to note here that Defendants agai n fail to account for the special nature of the \nFirst Amendment rights advanced in this ca se.  See, e.g., New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v. \nGonzales, 64 F.3d 1495, 1500 (10th Cir. 1995) (“First  Amendment rights of free expression and \nassociation are particularly apt to be found ripe for immediate protection, because of the fear of \n5 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 14 of 37 - Page ID # 151\nirretrievable loss.  In a wide variety of settings, courts have found First Amendment claims ripe, \noften commenting directly on the special need to  protect against any inhibiting chill;” ripeness  \ndismissal reversed). \n \nA.  The Organization and Individual Plaintiffs have Stated a Concrete and \nImminent Injury in Fact Resulting from the Operation of the Final Rule. \n \nPlaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High School, Catholic Mutual, Sister \nMary  Catherine and Stacy Molai are at imminent   risk  of  injury. Plaintif f  Catholic Socia l \nServices’, Pius X Catholic High School’s, Catholic Mutual’s, Sister Mary Catherine’s and Stacy \nMolai’s  plans  have b een  specifically  contracted  to exclude coverage for purposes of \ncontraception, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services. Compl. at ¶¶ 19, 26, 41, 49, 56. \nPlaintiffs will be coerced into purchasing or subsidizing coverage in direct contravention of their \nbeliefs or dropping coverage outrigh t if the Final Rule is upheld. This coercion constitutes an \ninjury-in-fact. \nTo establish standing, a “plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact, m eaning that the \ninjury  is (a )  concrete  and par ticularized  and  (b) actual or imm inent,  not conjectural or \nhypothetical.  Second, the injury must be traceable to the defendant’s challenged action. Third, it \nmust be ‘likely’ rather than ‘speculative’ that a favorable decision will redress the injury.” South \nDakota Farm Bureau, Inc. v. Hazeltine , 340 F.3d 583, 591 (8th  Cir. 2003) (quoting  Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130 ( 1992)). Plaintiffs meet all three \nrequirements.  As a res ult  of the Final Rule,   each  and every Plaintiff has suffered or will  \nimminently suffer injury-in-fact. \nAs a component of establishing standing to bring such a claim, Plaintiffs must show they \nhave been or are at im minent risk of being act ually injured by the operation of the Final Rule. \n6 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 15 of 37 - Page ID # 152\nToward that end, at least several of the individu al and organization Plaintiffs have alleged the \nfact that they do not meet the criteria to be  grandfathered (i.e., exempt) from the Final Rule’s \nRequirements and, thus, are at especially imminent risk of injury by the Final Rule’s operation.  \nThe health plans of Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High School and \nSister Mary Catherine do not qualify to be grandfathered from the ACA requirements. Compl. at \n¶¶ 21, 43, 50.  And even a grandfathered plan loses its grandfather status if it significantly cuts or \nreduces  benefits, rais es  co-insurance  charges,  significantly  raises  co-payment  charges, \nsignificantly  raises ded uctibles,  significantly  lowers  employer  contributions, or im poses  or \ntightens an annual lim it on the dollar value  of any benefits. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a), \n(g)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a), (g)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a), (g)(1).  \nPlaintiffs’ non-grandfathered health plans ar e immediately and direc tly affected by the \noperation of the Final Rule. These plans  must comply with the Final Rule on April 16, 2012. \nThat date is fixed definitively in the law.  Even  if Plaintiffs Catholic Social Serv ices, Pius X \nCatholic High School and Catholic  Mutual qualify for the tem porary enforcement safe harbor, \nthey must comply with the Final R ule upon the expira tion of the temporary enforcem ent safe \nharbor on August 1, 2013.  \nTo the extent Plaintiff Catholic Mutual is providing a health insurance plan and Plaintiff \nMolai is purchasing health insurance that are grandfathered by the A CA, they are required to \nretain such plans precis ely as they were at  their inception to avoid lo sing grandfather status. \nCompl. at ¶¶ 31, 59. Upon which tim e such plans are substantially modified, they becom e a \n“new plan” subject to the full gamut of ACA requirements, including the Final Rule itself.  By \nthe Federal Government’s own admission, this is bound to occur. \n7 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 16 of 37 - Page ID # 153\nHHS acknowledges there is “considerable  uncertainty” surrounding employer plans and \ntheir grandfather status beginning in 2011. U.S.  Department of Health and Hum an Services \n(“HHS”), Keeping the Health Plan You Have: The  Affordable Care Act and “Grandfathered”  \nHealth Plans. (accessed Feb. 20, 2012) < http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2010/06/keeping-the-\nhealth-plan-you-have-grandfathered.html>.  In fact, based on HHS “ mid-range”  assumptions  of the  \nnumber of plans that would remain grandfathered if they made changes consistent with changes \nmade in 2008 and 2009, only 55% of large em ployer and 34% of sm all employer plans would \nremain grandfathered by 2013. Id.  To this extent, for plans that currently qualify for grandfather \nstatus, HHS recognizes that loss of that status is imminent.  \n1.  Defendants’ “Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor” and “Promise of Futur e \nRulemaking” Do Not Deprive Plaintiffs of Standing to Bring Their Claims. \n \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs lack standing due to the Defendants having imposed a \n“temporary enforcement safe harbor” during wh ich limited time the Federal Gover nment has \nunilaterally promised to “not  take any enforcement action.” Def. Mem. at 14-15, 19. By the \nexpiration of the safe harbor on the fixed date  of August 1, 2013, De fendants, pursuant to an \nAdvance  Notice of Proposed Rulem aking,  promise  they  will have prom ulgated  unspecified \n“regulatory amendments” that will “accomm odate additional religious organizations’ religious \nobjections”  to subsidizing products and servi ces  violative of orga nization  and individual  \nPlaintiffs’  religious beliefs. Def. Mem .  at  15-16,  19-20. Neither of these factors deprives  \nPlaintiffs of standing to bring their claims. \nCourts  repeatedly have found standing to  pursue  a pre-enforcem ent  constitutional \nchallenge where the alleged harm will occur in the future. See, e.g., Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 \nU.S. 497, 521-23, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007) (standi ng based on rise in sea levels  by the end of this \ncentury);  Pierce  v. Soc’y of Sister s,  268 U.S. 510, 536, 45 S.Ct. 571 (1925) (standing to \n8 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 17 of 37 - Page ID # 154\nchallenge education act at leas t two years and five months before effective date);  Dep’t of \nCommerce  v. U.S. House of Reps. ,  525 U.S. 316, 332, 119 S.Ct.  765 (1999) (standing in \nFebruary 1998 to challenge sampling method for 2000 Census); Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 376 \nF.3d 1114, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (standing to contest fees not collectible for 13 years). Standing \n“depends on the probability of harm, not its temporal proximity.” See 520 S. Mich. Ave. Assocs. \nv. Devine, 433 F.3d 961, 962 (7th Cir. 2006).  \n“[I]mmediacy requires only that the anticipated injury occur with some fixed period of \ntime in the future, not that it ha ppen in the colloquial sense of soon or precisely within a certain \nnumber of days, weeks, or months.” Fla. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, \n1161 (11th Cir. 2008).  Given that standing “depends on the probability of harm, not its temporal \nproximity,” Devine, 433 F.3d at 962, Plaintiffs’ standing is not undermined by the imposition of \nthe temporary enforcement safe harbor. \nThis analysis and the imminence of the injury  faced by Plaintiffs is not m itigated by \neither Defendants’ temporary enforcement safe harbor or the March 21, 2012 release of the \ninformation gathering Advance Notice of Propo sed Rulemaking Regarding Certain Preventive \nServices Under the Affordable Care Ac t (“ANPRM”). 77 Fed. Reg. 16503 (Mar. 21, 2012). \nDefendants  contend that Plaintiffs’ injuries ,  though stemm ing  from wh at  they them selves \npromulgated as a Final Rule, are speculative and conjectural, depriving Plaintiffs of standing to \npursue their claims.  In support of this position, Defendants cite their “promises” of some future \nregulatory relief, despite there being no rulemaking process currently underway. It is upon these \npromises Defendants would have Plaintiffs rely to  their inevitable detriment. This sort of  ‘we \nreally didn’t mean it, and please trust us’ defense, however, has no basis in law or applicable \nprecedent. Defendants would have this Court turn  away Plaintiffs’ claims, forcing Plaintiffs to \n9 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 18 of 37 - Page ID # 155\nwatch the clock run out on Defenda nts’ self-imposed “temporary enforcement safe harbor” (the \nexpiration of which will imm ediately subject non-grandfathered individual and organizational \nPlaintiffs to a mandate in violation of their religious beliefs at a fixed and certain date), all on the \nbasis of hypothetical  speculati on about the possible outcom e of a potential future NPRM-\ninitiated rulemaking process – a process th at holds out n o assurance of mitigating the harm \nDefendants’ current and Final Rule poses.  \nIt  is im possible  for Plain tiffs  to discern whether th e  “anticipated  changes to the  \npreventive services coverage regulations,” Def. Mem. at 16, will ever materialize, let alone what \nthey may be. The only regulatory language currently operational and carrying the force of law is \nthat of the Final Rule, which Defendants them selves promulgated. Any reference Defendants \nmake to future changes to the Final Rule, in cluding changes that coul d hypothetically lead to \n“plaintiffs’ claim of injury . . . differ[ing] substantially from their current claim of injury,” id., is \na reference to something that exists only in the realm of speculative possibility. \nIndeed, Defendants themselves discuss these possible future amendments in speculative \nterms. They can do no more than d escribe the changes as having been  “promis[ed],” Id. at 15, \n“anticipated,” Id. at 16, and “forthcoming.” Id. Unlike the Final Rule, of course, such prom ised \naccommodations do not yet exist. The proposed language of such accom modations has not yet \neven been released. It was certainly not included in Defendants’ much-hyped ANPRM which, as \nDefendants themselves concede, is merely an “opportunity to, among other things, comment on \nideas suggested by defendants for accomm odating religious organizations, offer new ideas to \n‘enable religious organizations to avoid . .  . objectionable cooperation when it com es to the \nfunding of contraceptive coverage,’  and identify considerations  defendants should take into \naccount when amending the regulations.” Id.; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 16503, 16507. \n10 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 19 of 37 - Page ID # 156\nThe case of Boyle v. Anderson, 68 F.3d 1093 (8th Cir. 1995), advanced by Defendants to \nsupport their contention that this  Court should refrain from considering the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint, Def. Mem. at 16 n. 8, cuts directly against Defendants and exposes the critical flaws \nof  their defense by speculation approach. The  Boyle  decision is categorically unhelpful to \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss. The Boyle plaintiffs were found to lack standing to challenge \ncertain data collection regulations promulgated by the Minnesota Department of Health because, \nthough they were of a class of en tities “encouraged” to comply w ith the data collection, they \nwere expressly excluded from  the requirement. Boyle,  68 F.3d at 1100. The plaintiffs had \ncontended “that the State of Minnesota might at some point in the future change its position and \nrequire compliance with the data requirements” but the court rejected this hypothetical posture as \ninsufficient for establishing standing.  Id (emphasis added).  To quote Defendants them selves:  \n“The court … refused to issue ‘an advisory opinion to deal with the possibility that at some point \nin the future the State’ m ight ‘reverse [its] position’.”  Def. Mem. at 17, n.8, quoting  Boyle, 68 \nF.3d at 1100.  There, it was the  Boyle plaintiffs whose case was predicated on th e uncertain \npotential of future chan ge, whereas here, it is the  Defendants who seek to hide behind vague \npromises of future remedies for the current unconstitutional Final Rule.  The conjecture in which \nthey seek to engage does not warrant dismissal.  \nHere,  Plaintiffs have su fficiently  pleaded  that at least several of the individual and \norganization Plaintiffs are subject to the operation of the Final Rule. Com pl. at ¶¶ 21, 43, 50. \nThis, unlike the status of the Boyle plaintiffs, is hardly conject ure about a “possible” future \ninjury. Moreover, Plaintiffs are not alleging that Defendants “might at some point in the future \nchange [their] position and require compliance.” Rather, Plaintiffs  have been guaranteed a \nrequirement to comply with the Final Rule by virtue of the fact that the temporary enforcement \n11 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 20 of 37 - Page ID # 157\nsafe harbor expires on a fixed date: August 1, 2013. W hereas the Boyle plaintiffs claimed they \nwould only be harmed if the state changed its mind regarding a regulatory requirement, here, the \nFederal Government has already specified its Final Rule an d Plaintiffs are at imminent risk of \ninjury as a result. \nSimilarly unhelpful to Defendants are  the Eighth Circuit’s decisions in United States v. \nMetro St. Louis Sewer Dist., 569 F.3d 829 (8th Cir. 2009) and  Johnson v. Missouri, 142 F.3d \n1087  (8th Cir. 1998), which Defendants offer to  buttress  their contenti on  that the injuries \nPlaintiffs complain of are somehow speculative or conjectural. In those cases, standing was not \nestablished because litigants cou ld not sufficiently allege a current or imm inent concrete and \nparticularized injury unless a certain series of events occurred first. In each case, the occurrence \nof such events was found to be too speculative to justify standing.  \nHere, no such serie s of events must take place for Plaintiffs’ complained of injury to \noccur. All that must occur is the expiration of the temporary enforcement safe harbor, which is \nguaranteed to occur on August 1, 2013. Again, the occurrence of this event is not conjectural or \nspeculative. No operational regulatory language currently exists upon which Plaintiffs could rely \nfor the notion that such injuries will not occur.  The only speculation  at issue is the speculation \nadvanced by Defendants that they somehow will remedy the wrongs through amendments that \nthey cannot or will not now recite and that they assert are to be based on “ideas” not yet offered \nand on “considerations” not yet taken into account.  Def. Mem. at 16. \nDefendants make a number of speculative a nd hypothetical representations to cloud the \nactual and imminent injury posed by Defendants’ already promulgated Final Rule. Def. Mem. at \n15-16, 19-20. Defendants claim that by the expiration of the temporary enforcement safe harbor, \nthey “will have finalized am endments to the [Final Rule] that will accommodate additional \n12 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 21 of 37 - Page ID # 158\nreligious organizations’ religious objections to providing contraception coverage.” Def. Mem. at \n19. They go on to note that the “amendments are likely to affect the individual plaintiffs as well” \nand that the ANPRM s uggests, among other opti ons, “that amendments might require health \ninsurance issuers to offer health insurance coverage without contraceptive coverage to religious \norganizations that object to such coverage on religious grounds.” Id.  \nIt is difficult to conceive of  language more speculative than this. Of course, it is these \nvague assurances, about a future rulemaking that may or may not occur, upon which Defendants \nclaim  Plaintiffs  must  rely  for fut ure  relief,  while sim ultaneously  claiming  that, som ehow, \nDefendants’ Final Rule is apparently not  actually final.   Not surprisingly, Defendants offer no \nlegal basis for their conclusion that their “Final Rule” is not to be analyzed as a final rule.  And \nDefendants’ implicit proposition that Plaintiff religious organizations and their employees can \ndefer all thought, work, and planning now on their 2013 insurance needs, despite the existence of \nan unamended Final Rule that Plaintiffs promulgated and have not rescinded, is as remarkable as \ntheir legal analysis.  One certa inly could imagine a revamped rule alo ng the lines at which \nDefendants hint that would maintain all the constitutional infirmities of the current Final Rule \nand that in no way would am eliorate the constitutional problems that Defendants impose.  To \nundertake a constitutional analysis of such a hypothetical amendment, however, is worse than a \nmug’s game – it is an impossibility, for no one can analyze language that has not been specified.  \nWhat has been specified, and published by Defendants, is their indefensible Final Rule.  Having \nput forth their Final Rule, Defendants cannot now be heard to argue that it can evade review . \nPlaintiffs have established they will suffer a concrete injury to core First Amendment and RFRA-\nprotected  rights at a s pecified  time in th e  near  future.  Defendants’ argum ents  regarding \n13 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 22 of 37 - Page ID # 159\nspeculative remedies are simply without merit and accordingly their Motion to Dismiss should \nbe denied. \nII.  THE STATE PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING \nA.  Plaintiff States Face an  Actual, Imminent, and Concrete Injury Because the \nFinal Rule Will Result in a Substantial  Enrollment Increase in Plaintiff States’ \nMedicaid Programs. \n \nPlaintiff States have standing to bring suit because the Final Rule will force the reduction \nof  private health in surance  enrollment  among or ganizations  and individua ls  like Plaintif fs \nCatholic Social Services, Pius X C atholic High School, Catholic Mutual, Sister Mary Catherine \nand Stacy Molai, thereby substantially increasing the burden imposed on Plaintiff States’ budgets \nvia enrollment in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid Programs.  Though the Federal Government’s stated \npurpose for the Final R ule is to expand access to coverage, see generally, U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, A statement by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretary  Kathleen Sebelius  (last  modified  Jan.  20,  2012)      \n<http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html>, its practical effect is to induce individuals \nand organizations to drop coverage, either for them selves or for their employees, respectively.  \nWithout an exemption for Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services and Pius X Catholic High School, \nwhose religious beliefs forbid th e subsidization of contraceptives through their employer-based \nhealth plans, such organizations will sim ply drop coverage for their empl oyees rather than pay \nfor services which are antithetical to their moral beliefs. Compl. at ¶ 42. \nThe effect of religious organization employers, like Catholic Social Services and Pius X \nCatholic  High School, dropping coverage for th eir  employees  will be an i mmediate  and \nsubstantial spike in the number of enrollments in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs, as many of \nthe  employees  will in variably  shift  to Medic aid  to rem ain  in com pliance  with the ACA’s \n14 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 23 of 37 - Page ID # 160\nindividual coverage mandate. Compl. at ¶ 85.  In creased Medicaid enrollment as a result of the \nACA’s overall mandate already threatens the States’ budgetary stability. Compl. at ¶ 86.  Forcing \nanother round of enrollment resulting from religious organization employers dropping coverage \nwill magnify this concern substantially. Id.  \n  Through  a com bination  of m andatory  and  voluntary  expansions to eligibility and \ncoverage, as well as demographic and econom ic changes over the past ha lf-century, Medicaid \nhas expanded exponentially and is now the single  largest federal grant-in-aid program to the \nstates.  Medicaid presently accounts  for more than 40% of a ll federal funds dispersed to states \nand approximately 7% of all federal spending. See Florida v. United States HHS, 780 F.Supp.2d \n1256 (N.D. Fla. 2011). In 2009 alone, states received more than $250 billion in federal Medicaid \nspending,  with the av erage  State receiv ing  at  least  $1  billion, an d  many  states receiv ing \nsignificantly more.  The ACA envisions expand ing Medicaid spending s ubstantially.  Federal \nfunding continues to cover no less than 50% and as much as 83% of each state’s Medicaid costs, \n42 U.S.C. § 1396d(b), and combined state and fede ral Medicaid spending is the equivalent of  \n20% of an average State’s  total annual spending.  Nat’l Ass’n  of State Budget Officers,  2008 \nState Expenditure Report (“NASBO Report”), Table 5 (State Spending by Function as a Percent \nof Total State Expenditures, Fiscal 2008 ) (Fall 2009).  Moreover, all  of those numbers reflect \nfederal and state spending before the significant increases envisioned by the ACA. Accordingly, \nincreases in Medicaid enrollment resulting from the Final Rule would drive spending higher \neven than that resulting from the ACA’s other requirements.  \n  Medicaid  spending  has  become  such a cost  to  the  states  that,  concurrent  with its  \nmandating  a significant  increase  in  state Medicaid spending, th e  Federal Governm ent  has \nrecognized that the fiscal stability of states ov er the next decade will largely depend on their \n15 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 24 of 37 - Page ID # 161\nability to reduce the seemingly ever-increasing costs of the program.  See Cong. Budget Office, \nThe Long-Term Budget Outlook (June 2010) 27 (“state governments—which pay a large share of \nMedicaid’s costs and have considerable influence on those costs—will need to reduce spending \ngrowth in order to balance their budgets”); U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office,  State and Local \nGovernments:  Fiscal  Pressures  Could Have  Implications  for  Future  Delivery  of \nIntergovernmental  Programs  (GAO-10-899) 6 (July 2010)  (recommending  that States \nimmediately and persistently cu t Medicaid costs “for each a nd every year going forward [to \nachieve]  equivalent to a 12.3 percent reduc tion  in state and local   government  current \nexpenditures”). \nAccordingly,  the fiscal im pact  of increa sed  Medicaid  enrollments  on state budgets \nbrought about by  any reason is beyond doubt. Plaintiff States  have already dem onstrated an \ninterest in opposing the ACA as  a whole due, in part, to the law’ s massive effect on the States’ \nMedicaid program. An interest in opposing th e Final Rule, prom ulgated pursuant to the ACA \nitself, rests in part on re lated grounds. The States have alleged  a “concrete and particularized” \ninjury that is “fairly traceable” to the Final Rule and redressed by the relief requested. Summers \nv. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493, 129 S.Ct. 1142 (2009).  \nFinally,  Plaintiffs’  injuries  can  be  redressed  by a decision holdi ng  the Final Rule \nunconstitutional  and unlawful, thereby preven ting  unnecessary interference with Plaintiff \nCatholic  Social Services’, Pi us  X Catholic High School’s, Cat holic  Mutual’s, S ister  Mary \nCatherine’s and Stacy Molai’s re ligious liberty and substantial increases to Plaintiff States’ \nbudgets via enrollment in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid Programs. \n \n \n16 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 25 of 37 - Page ID # 162\nB.  Plaintiff States Will Suffer an Actual Injury by Imposition of the Final Rule and \nAre Not Bringing this Suit as a Parens Patriae Action. \n \nDefendants assert that State Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Final Rule because \nthey are impermissibly suing the federal government in a parens patriae action in violation of \nthe rule articulated in Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597 (1923). Def. Mem. at \n21. In Mellon, the Supreme Court held th at states cannot sue the federal gov ernment in a \nrepresentative  capacity  to protec t  their  citizens  from  the oper ation  of  an  allegedly \nunconstitutional federal law. 262 U.S. at 485–86. \nDespite Defendants’ claims to the contrary, St ate Plaintiffs are not in violation of the \nMellon rule. Rather, the States have standing to challenge the Final Rule because th e increased \nenrollment in state Medicaid programs spurred by the Final Rule will f urther threaten Plaintiff \nStates’ already strained budgetary stability. Compl. at ¶¶ 84-87. This allegation of fiscal injury to \nState Plaintiffs, described in greater detail in Section A, infra, of this Part should be accepted as \ntrue by this Court and utilized to draw the reasonable inference that Defendants are liable for the \nmisconduct alleged to cause State  Plaintiffs’ imminent injury. Hamilton v. Palm, 621 F.3d 816, \n817 (8th Cir. 2010).  Accordingly, State Plaintiffs are not bringing this action under the doctrine \nof parens patriae.  \nAlternatively, if the Court first finds that any of the individual or organization Plaintiffs \nhas standing, it need not determ ine whether Plaintiff States likewise  have standing. As the  \nEleventh Circuit recognized in a challenge to the same statute from which the Final Rule sprung, \nin the event a particular Plaintiff may not have standing, the law is abundantly clear that “so long \nas at least one plaintiff has standing to raise each claim—as is the case here—[the c ourt] need \nnot address whether the remaining plaintiffs have standing.” Florida v. United States HHS, 648 \nF.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2011); See, also, Watt v. Energy Action Educ. Found., 454 U.S. 151, \n17 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 26 of 37 - Page ID # 163\n160, 102 S. Ct. 205 (1981) (\"Because  we find California has standi ng, we do not consider the \nstanding of the other plaintiffs.\"); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n252, 264, 97 S. Ct. 555 (1977) (\"Because  of the presence of this plaintiff, we need not consider \nwhether the other individual and corporate plaintiffs have standing to maintain suit.\"); ACLU of \nFla., Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty. Sch. Bd., 557 F.3d 1177, 1195 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"Because Balzli \nhas standing to raise those claim s, we need not  decide whether either  of the organizational \nplaintiffs also has standing to do so.\"); Jackson v. Okaloosa Cnty., 21 F.3d 1531, 1536 (11th Cir. \n1994) (\"In order for this court to have jurisdicti on over the claims before us, at least one na med \nplaintiff  must  have standing  for  each of the claim s.\");  Mountain  States Legal Found. v. \nGlickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1232, 320 U.S. App. D.C. 87 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (\"For each claim , if \nconstitutional and prudential st anding can be shown for at leas t one plaintiff, we need not \nconsider the standing of the other plaintiffs to raise that claim.\").   \nAs Plaintiff States have articulated a concrete injury that will be redressed by the Court’s \nreview of the unconstitutionality of the Final Rule, Plaintiffs States have standing to bring their \nclaims and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be denied. \nIII.  THE RULE IS FINAL AGENCY ACTION AND RIPE FOR REVIEW \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss should further be denied because the Final Rule is final \nagency action and ripe for judicial resolution. Ripeness turns on two factors: “the fitness of the \nissues for judicial decision and  the hardship to the parties of  withholding court consideration.” \nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507 (1967), overruled on other grounds in \nCalifano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S.Ct. 980 (1997).  \nIn Abbott, the Court determined a pre-enforcement challenge to Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act regulations was ripe because the regulations were “quite clearly definitive,” Abbott \n18 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 27 of 37 - Page ID # 164\nLabs., 387 U.S. at 151; the regulations “were m ade effective upon publication,” id. at 152; and \n“[t]here [was] no hint that th [e] regulation [was] informal. Id. at 151. Like the regulations in \nAbbott, the Rule is a “Final Rule.” 77 Fed. Reg. 8725.  There is no indication that the Final Rule \nis  informal.  In determ ining  finality, “[s]uch re gulations  have the for ce  of law before their \nsanctions are invoked as well as after.” Abbott, 387 U.S. at 150 (quoting Columbia Broadcasting \nSystem  v. United States ,  316 U.S. 407, 418-19, 62 S.Ct. 1194 (1942)). “When, as here, \n[regulations] are promulgated . . . and the expected conformity to them causes injury cognizable \nby a court of equity, they are appropriately the subject of attack . . .” Id.  Plaintiffs’ injury in this \ncase is imminent and actual a nd enforceable as the Final Rule  against the non-g randfathered \nPlaintiffs on August 1, 2013. If “t he enforcement of a statute is certain, a pre-enforcem ent \nchallenge will not be rejected on ripeness grounds.” Browning, 522 F.3d at 1164 (em phasis \nadded). \nPlaintiffs’ claims are also ripe for review because delaying judicial review will result in \nhardship for Plaintiffs. “The plaintif fs need not wait until the threatened injury occurs, but the \ninjury must be certainly impending.” Public Water Supply Dist. No. 10 v. City of Peculiar,  345 \nF.3d 570, 573 (8th Cir. 2003) (remanding the case with instructions to dismiss  as not impending \nbecause the city’s invo lvement in a hypothetica l dissolution could only occur after a citizen  \npetition drive that had no indication of occurring).  Plaintiffs’ injury is certainly imminent, and \nthey must take immediate account of the Final Rule and its coercive impact on religious liberties.  \nThe Final Rule requires Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High School, \nCatholic Mutual, Sister Mary Catherine and Stacy Molai to make immediate and significant \nchanges to their health care coverage arrangements in contravention of their religious and moral \nbeliefs, or forego health insurance altogether and face a steep civil penalty in doing so.  Injury to \n19 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 28 of 37 - Page ID # 165\nPlaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X Catholic High School,  Catholic Mutual, Sister Mary \nCatherine and Stacy Molai is inev itable and, “[w]here the inevita bility of the operation of a \nstatute against certain individu als is patent, it is ir relevant to the e xistence of a justiciable \ncontroversy that there will be a tim e delay before the disputed provisions come into effect.” \nBlanchette v. Ct. Gen. Ins. Corps., 419 U.S. 102, 143, 95 S.Ct. 335 (1974).   \nThe Defendants suggest that the Plaintiffs m ay not have to be forced to com ply with the \nFinal  Rule until Augus t  1, 2013. Def. Me m.  at 32. They contend   that the P laintiffs  are \ngrandfathered, and “even if [Plaintiffs ] are not grandfathered, [Plaintiffs] can qualify for the  \ntemporary enforcement safe harbor . . .” Id. This argument presupposes that the Plaintiffs object \nto the Final Rule solely on the grounds of possible enforcement before August 1, 2013. The fact \nthat the Final Rule will not be enforced agai nst religious organization  employers that qualify \nunder the guidelines until August 1, 2013 does not mean that the Final Rule will not be felt now \nor in the immediate or near future. Plaintiffs must start making plans now to comply with the \nFinal Rule and any ina bility to offer health insurance coverage will have severe im pact on \nPlaintiff religious organization employers’ ability to re tain and recruit em ployees. See, e.g., \nRetail Indus. Leaders Ass'n v. Fielder, 475 F.3d 180, 188 (4th Cir. 2007) (finding ripeness where \nplaintiff  had to alter  “accounting  procedures and healthcare spending  now”  in planning to \ncomply with new act) (emphasis in original).  \nWhile Defendants repeatedly deride Plaintiffs’ claims as speculative, they assert that \nPlaintiffs should rely on the prom ise of future rulemaking they concede is “too speculative for \nreview.” Def. Mem. at 31. After all, the Federa l Government admits that the ANPRM is m eant \nonly to “offer id eas and solicit input.” Def. Mem. at 2, 31. The ANPRM ostensibly prom ises \nfuture rulemaking but this mere promise does not affect the finality of the current Final Rule and \n20 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 29 of 37 - Page ID # 166\nits current applicability to  Plaintiffs. 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8728;  See Columbia Broadcasting \nSystem, 316 U.S. at 420 (“The regulations’ applicabil ity to all who are within their term s does \nnot depend upon future administrative action.”). Similar to the agency order in  Minnesota Pub. \nUtils. Comm’n v. FCC, 483 F.3d 570, 582-83 (8th Cir. 2007),  the speculative promises in the \nANPRM to possibly take some future action do “not purport to actually do so and until that day \ncomes it is only a m ere prediction.” See also U.S. Telecom Ass'n v. FCC , 359 F.3d 554, 594 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (holding a general prediction set forth in order does not constitute final agency \naction). \nFurther, Defendants’ contention that the  “promises and ideas” solicited by the ANPRM \n“will likely moot” Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Final Rule, is not supported in the authorities cited \nby Defendants. Def. Mem . at 31. In  Vorbeck v. Schnicker, 660 F.2d 1260 (8th Cir. 1981), \nplaintiffs’  claims  were dism issed  on ripeness grounds w here  the  plaintiffs were unable to \n“articulate any protected activities from which they had been deterred under the regulations” or \nspecify “the kinds of activity that  they desire to engage in.”  Id. at 1264-65. In contrast with the \nVorbeck plaintiffs, Plaintiffs Catholic Social Services, Pius X  Catholic High School, Catholic \nMutual, Sister Mary Catherine and  Stacy Molai ha ve specifically articulated such activities. \nCompl. at ¶¶ 92-94, 96-104, 106- 107, 109-117. Despite Defendants’ contention to the contrary, \nthe mere promise to take future action has no impact on the finality of the current Final Rule. \nIn addition, Defendants advance Lake Pilots Ass'n v. United States Coast Guard,  257 F. \nSupp. 2d 148 (D.D.C. 2003) to support their position that a challenged rule is “not ripe where the \nagency undertook a new rulemaking to address [the] issue raised.” Def. Mem. at 30. However, \nDefendants fail to point out that the court in  Lake Pilots Ass’n dismissed the claim because the \nCoast Guard had “admitted its error” and is sued a “temporary final rule” that withdrew th e \n21 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 30 of 37 - Page ID # 167\nchallenged rule for the tim e period at issue.  Id. at 154, 161. Here, sadly, perhaps inexplicably, \nbut tellingly, Defendants have taken no such action.  See, e.g., Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. \n296,  300, 118 S.Ct. 1257 (1998) (denying review wh ere  plaintiff has “ not  pointed to any \nparticular” application of the law that wa s “currently foreseen or even likely.”); Pub. Serv. \nComm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., Inc., 344 U.S. 237, 244, 73 S.Ct. 236 (1952) (dism issing claims \nwhere plaintiff did not seek a judgment or specific order but merely a declaration that its conduct \nconstituted interstate commerce); Wyoming Outdoor Council v. United States Forest Serv.,  165 \nF.3d 43, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (dism issing claim on ripeness grounds where action was brought \nbefore leases subject to the regulation had even been issued); Missouri ex rel. Missouri Highway \n& Transp. Comm'n v. Cuffley, 112 F.3d 1332 (8th Cir. 1997) (dismissing the claim as premature \nwhere certain “what-ifs” had to occur before plaintiff would suffer any injury); Toca Producers \nv.  FERC,  411 F.3d 262, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (dis missing  claims  where “in the peculiar \ncircumstances of this case” the agen cy action was “not sufficiently final” because  both parties \nagreed the dispute was the subject of an ongoing agency proceeding) (emphasis added).   \nDefendants would have the Court believe that this is a case like  Texas Independent \nProducers v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , 413 F.3d 479, 484 (5th Cir. 2005), which \ninvolved future actions regarding matters as to which the plaintiffs there were “unable to plan far \nin  advance,”  and where the partial regulatio ns  provided “no sense of what oil and gas \nconstruction  activities  would fall under EPA’ s  permitting  requirements.”  Here, however, \nDefendants frankly acknowledge th e sweep of the Final R ules as “against certain non-profit \norganizations  with religious objections to  covering  contraception  –  like the o rganization \nplaintiffs and the employers of the individual plaintiffs,” Def. Mem. at 29, and any im plication \nby these Defendants that em ployer-based insurance does not require prior planning (with or \n22 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 31 of 37 - Page ID # 168\nwithout mandates) seems passing strange for them.  By the same token, Defendants invoke Ohio \nForestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733, 734 (1998) – a cas e in which the Sierra Club \nwas not able to identify how the generalized “p lan” it challenged inflicted any “significant \npractical harm” on its interests, or point “to any other way in which the Plan could now force it \nto modify its behavior in order to avoid future  adverse consequences ….”   In that context, the \nCourt noted that:  “the provision s of the Plan  that the Sierra  Club challenges do not create \nadverse effects of a strictly lega l kind, that is, effects of a sort  that traditionally would have \nqualified as harm.”  Id. at 733.  Here, by contrast, the injuries alleged qualify as harm under any \nstandard (to the point w here Defendants concede that “plaintiffs’ complaint raises largely legal \nclaims,” Def.Mem. at 30, and express the intent to adopt undefined remedial measures). And the \nharms alleged by the individua l and institutional Plaintiffs here are of a sort to which ripene ss \nanalysis is especially sensitive.  See, e.g., Kansas Judicial Review v. Stout, 519 F.3d 1107, 1116 \n(10th Cir. 2008) (“ripeness analysis is ‘relaxed  somewhat’ in the context of a First Am endment \nfacial challenge”); Greyson Currence v. City of Cincinnati , 28 Fed. A ppx. 438, 441 (6th C ir. \n2002) (“Ripeness analysis is relaxed for First Amendment cases involving a facial challenge to a \nregulation because courts see a need to prevent the chilling of expressive activity”). \nIn sum, Plaintiffs seek review of a Final Rule. Any delay will result in imminent hardship \nfor Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the Final Rule is ripe for judicial resolution.  \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE MADE S UFFICIENT FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS TO \nSHOW THEY WILL BE INJURED BY TH E OPERATION OF THE FINAL \nRULE. \n \nPlaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show they will be injured by the operation of the \nFinal Rule. The allegations set forth in Plaintiffs’ Complaint are neither “naked assertions” nor \n“devoid of further factual enhanc ement.” Def. Mem. at 13. Consis tent with the principles of \n23 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 32 of 37 - Page ID # 169\nnotice pleading, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations are more than sufficient to overcome Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss. \nIn considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court assumes that all facts \nalleged in the complaint are true, construes the complaint liberally in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff, and grants dismissal only if “it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove  \nno set of facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief.” Coleman v. Watt, 40 F.3d 255, 258 (8th \nCir. 1994); Scheuer v. Rhodes,  416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683 (1974), overruled on other \ngrounds by Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 191, 104 S. Ct. 3012 (1984).  \nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a “short and plain statement \nof the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Hamilton v. Palm, 621 F.3d 816, 817 \n(8th Cir. 2010). The U.S. Supreme Court’s Twombly and Iqbal decisions clarified  the “short and \nplain statement of the claim” that a plaintiff must set forth in a complaint, but it did not abrogate \nthe notice pleading standard of Rule 8(a)(2).  Id.; see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,  550 \nU.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007) (regarding pleadi ng standards for antit rust parallel conduct \nviolations) ; Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (2009)  (arising from pleadings in \nBivens action). Rule 8(a)(2) is satisfied “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that th e defendant is liable for the m isconduct alleged.” \nId., quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. However, “to survive a motion to \ndismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for \nrelief that is plausible on its face.” Id. Determining whether a claim is plausible is a “context-\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its  judicial experience and common \nsense.” Hamilton, 621 F.3d at 818, quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. \n24 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 33 of 37 - Page ID # 170\nIn the context of the instant case and pursuant to even the minimum application of \ncommon sense, Plaintiffs have satisfied this heightened pleading standard. The legal conclusion \nthat individual and organization Pl aintiffs advance is that the operation of the Final Rule will  \nforce them to subsidize activity in contravention with their religious beliefs. Compl. at ¶¶ 18-21, \n25-26, 31-33, 39-43, 48-50, 56-60.  Th e facts of the promulgation and existence of the Final \nRule, the purpose and principles of the individua l and organization Plaintiffs, and the nature of \ntheir beliefs all are explicitly alleged.  Again, Defendants themselves purport to understand the \nconflict between the Final Rule and those beliefs full well, and say they will plan at some future \npoint  “to accommodate the c oncerns  expressed by Plainti ffs”  and by other “non-profit \norganizations  with religious objections to  covering  contraception  –  like the o rganization \nplaintiffs and the employers of the individual plaintiffs.”  Def. Mem. at 29.   Thus not only are \nthe requisite facts alleged, they are to that extent conceded by the Defendants. \nThe principles of notice pleading require no further detail be set forth in the Complaint on \nthis  point.  The alleg ation  that sev eral  of  the  individual and organi zation  Plaintiffs are  not \ngrandfathered and, thus, subject to the Final Rule’s requirements upon its taken effect, m ust be \naccepted as true by the Court. Hamilton, supra, 621 F.3d at 817, quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556. Plaintiffs’ allegations are  more than sufficient to permit the Court to \ndraw  the reasonable inference that Defenda nts  are liable for the m isconduct  alleged.  Id. \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint sets forth a claim for relief which is plausible on its face, consistent with \nthe Twombly-Iqbal pleading standard. Accordingly, Defendants’ contentions that Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege sufficient factual material to support Plaintiffs’ legal conclusions is without merit. \nLikewise, Plaintiff States have alleged sufficient facts to entitle them to relief.  As a result \nof the Final Rule’s compulsory  violation of Plaintiff individuals’ religious  beliefs, Plaintiff \n25 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 34 of 37 - Page ID # 171\nindividuals will drop their private health insurance coverage. Compl. at ¶¶ 20, 30, 76. The only  \nhealth insurance coverage options for Plaintiff individuals will be to enroll in Medicaid or enroll \nin state-based health insurance exchanges. Comp l. at ¶ 76. “[T]he deci sion by the uninsured to \nforego insurance results in a cost-shifting scenario.” Florida ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. U.S. Dept. of \nHealth and Human Services, 648 F.3d 1235, 1244 (11th Cir. 2011).  \nWhen religious organization em ployers cease provision of health insurance in P laintiff \nStates in order to avoid the requirements of the Final Rule, an immediate and substantial spike in \nthe number of enrollments in Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs will result, as many affected \nemployees will invariably shift to Medicaid to remain in compliance with the ACA’s individual \ncoverage mandate. Compl. at ¶  85. In addition, religious organi zation employers operating in \nPlaintiffs States will cease provid ing charitable services to persons who do not  share their \nreligious tenets, in an effort to qualify under the Religious Employer Exemption. Those people \nno longer served by such charitable services w ill place further p ressure on Plaintiff States’ \nMedicaid programs as they inevitably increase reliance on public resources for support. Compl. \nat ¶ 87. Courts have recognized states’ economic  interests as adequate to support a claim . See \nDixon v. Heckler, 589 F.Supp. 1512 (D.C.N.Y. 1984);  Avery v. Heckler, 584 F.Supp. 312 (D. \nMass. 1984) (holding that Massachusetts could intervene to challenge regulations where the state \npossesses a proprietary interest in minimizing the number of beneficiaries on its welfare rolls).  \nSection 1311 of the ACA requires that “each St ate shall, not later than January 1, 2 014, \nestablish an American Health Benefit Exchange (“Exchange”) that facilitates the purchase of \nqualified health plans . . .” 42 U.S.C. 18031. Cons equently, many Plaintiff States are currently \ncontemplating and researching state-based heal th care exchanges based on current projections. \nAny addition to these projections will harm Plaintiff States’ economic interest.  \n26 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 35 of 37 - Page ID # 172\nAt the same time, Plaintiff States’ Medica id programs are facing the acute strain of \ndramatically increased enrollments due to the ACA’s individual coverage mandate. Compl. at ¶ \n86.  The ACA envisions expanding Medicaid spendi ng  substantially. Increases in Medicaid \nenrollment resulting from the Final Rule would  drive spending higher even than that resulting \nfrom the ACA’s other requirem ents. Quite simply, any increase in the num ber of citizens who \nare no longer insured by their employer, as a result of the Final Rule, will harm Plaintiff States’ \neconomic interest. Accordingly, State Plaintiffs  have stated a claim upon which relief m ay be \ngranted by this Court. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, this Court should reject Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \nDefendants’ promises of unspecified future remedial action to address the wrongs done by their \nrulemaking cannot shield them from answering the constitutional and statutory challenges to the \nFinal Rule that they themselves promulgated and that – to this day – remains the unaltered, if \nindefensible, Final Rule at issue. \n \nDated: May 24, 2012 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSTATE OF NEBRASKA, JON BRUNING \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEBRASKA \n \nALAN WILSON,  \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n \nBILL SCHUETTE \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF MICHIGAN \n \nGREG ABBOTT \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS \n \n27 \n \n\n4:12-cv-03035-WKU-CRZ   Doc # 33   Filed: 05/24/12   Page 36 of 37 - Page ID # 173\nPAMELA JO BONDI \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA \n \nMICHAEL DeWINE \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF OHIO \n \nSCOTT PRUITT,  \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF OKLAHOMA \n \nSISTER MARY CATHERINE, CK,  \n \nSTACY MOLAI,  \n \nCATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES,  \n \nPIUS X CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL, and  \n \nTHE CATHOLIC MUTUAL RELIEF SOCIETY OF \nAMERICA,   \n \nPlaintiffs.    \n \n     BY:  JON BRUNING, #20351 \n            Attorney General \n \n \n        BY:  s/ Katherine J.

WEST, MD, in his \nofficial capacity as Chairman of the Medical \nLicensure Commission of Alabama; and \nMARTHA LAVENDER, DSN, RN, in her official \ncapacity as President of the Alabama Board of \nNursing, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nPlaintiffs, by and through their undersigned attorneys, bring this Complaint against the \nabove-named Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in office, and in support \nthereof allege the following: \n  1 \n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Plaintiffs, who operate the only licensed facilities in Montgomery, Birmingham, \nand Mobile where abortions are performed, bring this civil rights action, on behalf of themselves, \ntheir  patients,  physicians,  and  staff,  under  the  U.S.  Constitution  and  42  U.S.C.  § 1983,  to \nchallenge § 4(c) of Alabama House Bill 57, Reg. Sess. (2013) (“HB 57”).1  That provision will \nunconstitutionally  restrict  the  availability  of  abortion  services  in  Alabama  by  imposing  a \nmedically  unnecessary  requirement  that  all  physicians  who  perform  abortions  have  staff \nprivileges at a local hospital (“staff privileges requirement” or “requirement”).  Plaintiffs and \ntheir physicians cannot comply with the staff privileges requirement, and, unless it is enjoined, \nwill be unable to provide abortions after that requirement goes into effect on July 1, 2013. \n2.  By making Plaintiffs’ clinic licenses contingent on their physicians obtaining staff \nprivileges  at  local  hospitals,  Alabama  has  unconstitutionally  delegated  standardless  and \nunreviewable licensing authority to private parties – the hospitals – in violation of Plaintiffs’ due \nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  In violation of the rights of Plaintiffs’ patients, \nmoreover, the requirement will shut down three-fifths of the abortion providers in the state, with \nno health benefit.  The purpose and effect of the requirement, which is wholly unnecessary and \nunreasonable, is to impose a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking abortion prior to \nviability, in violation of their constitutional right to privacy. \n3.  If  Plaintiffs  continue  to  provide  abortions  without  complying  with  the  staff \nprivileges requirement, they would put their clinic licenses at risk, and if their physicians do so, \nthey would jeopardize their medical licenses.  In addition, any clinic administrator, such as \n                                                        \n1 A copy of the HB 57 is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n  2 \n\nPlaintiff Ayers, who “knowingly and willfully permits the facility” to operate without complying \nwith the staff privileges requirement is guilty of a Class C felony and subject to imprisonment. \n4.  The staff privileges requirement threatens irreparable injury to Plaintiffs, their \nphysicians, staff, and their patients.  Plaintiffs Reproductive Health Services and Ayers will be \nforced to close the clinic and Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. will be forced to cut \nstaff, services, and hours.  No remedy is available to them at law.  The requirement, moreover, \nwill threaten the health of Alabama women seeking abortions; and deprive women of their \nconstitutionally protected right to obtain a pre-viability abortion. \n5.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  from  those  constitutional \ndeprivations. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ federal claims under \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343(a)(3)-(4). \n7.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202 and by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n8.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to this action occurred in this district and the majority of Defendants are \nlocated in this district. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n9.  Plaintiff  Planned  Parenthood  Southeast,  Inc.  (“PPSE”)  is  a  not-for-profit \ncorporation, organized under the laws of Georgia.

Through one of its corporate predecessors, PPSE has provided care in \nAlabama since 1930.  PPSE operates two health centers in Alabama, one in Birmingham and one \nin Mobile, and is the only licensed abortion provider in those communities.  In its Alabama \nhealth centers, PPSE provides medication abortion up to 9 weeks of pregnancy, as measured \nfrom the woman’s last menstrual period (“LMP”) and surgical abortion through 14 weeks LMP.  \nPPSE sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its patients, physicians, and staff. \n10.  Plaintiff Reproductive Health Services (“RHS”) is a licensed abortion facility, \nlocated in Montgomery, Alabama, that has provided safe and legal abortion services to women \nfrom Alabama and neighboring states for more than 35 years.  RHS provides a range of high-\nquality reproductive health care services, including routine pap smears and well-woman exams; \ntesting for sexually transmitted infections; contraceptive counseling and care, including Depo \nProvera shots; pregnancy testing and all options counseling; abortion services; and referrals for \npre-natal  care  and/or  adoption  services.

Defendant \nLavender is sued in her official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Abortion in Alabama \n21.  Legal abortion is one of the safest procedures in contemporary medical practice.   \nThe risk of abortion complications is minimal: nationwide, less than 0.3% of abortion patients \nexperience a complication that requires hospitalization.  Plaintiffs’ hospitalization rates are even \nlower. \n22.  Plaintiffs operate three of the five licensed abortion clinics in the state.  (The only \nother licensed abortion clinics in the state are located in Tuscaloosa and Huntsville.)  \n23.  Women  seek  abortions  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  familial,  medical, \nfinancial, and personal reasons.  Approximately one in three women in this country will have an \nabortion by age 45.  Most women having abortions (61%) already have at least one child, and \n66% plan to have children when they are older, financially able to provide necessities for them, \nand/or in a supportive relationship with a partner so their children will have two parents. \n24.  Plaintiffs’ health centers are licensed as “abortion or reproductive health centers” \nby the Alabama Department of Public Health (“DPH”), and even before the events giving rise to \nthis lawsuit, were subject to and in compliance with extensive regulations, including but not \nlimited to those relating to patient care, infection control, personnel, physician qualifications, fire \n  7 \n\nevacuation plans, emergency communications, recordkeeping, and physical plant requirements \n(such as minimum doorway sizes and room sizes, interior finishes and flooring material, and \nemergency exits).  See Ala. Admin. Code r. 420-5-1-.01 et seq.  DPH conducts extensive annual \nsurveys of Plaintiffs’ health centers to ensure compliance with the regulations.   \n25.  As required by those regulations, Plaintiffs also maintain contracts with outside \ncovering physicians with “staff privileges at a hospital within the same standard metropolitan \nstatistical area [as the clinic] that permit him or her to perform dilation and curettage, laparotomy \nprocedures,  hysterectomy,  and  any  other  procedures  necessary  to  treat  abortion-related \ncomplications.”  Ala. Admin. Code r. 420-5-1-.03(6)(b)(4).  The covering physicians, or  a \nqualified substitute, must be available to provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Id. r. \n420-5-1-.03(6)(b).  \n26.  Even though abortion is extremely safe, particularly at the gestational ages at \nwhich Plaintiffs provide abortions, Plaintiffs are prepared to provide high quality care in the rare \nevent  of  complications.    In  fact,  most  complications  related  to  abortion  are  safely  and \nappropriately managed in the clinic setting.   \n27.  In the exceedingly rare event that a patient needs to be transferred via ambulance \nfrom an abortion clinic to a hospital, the EMTs will take the patient to the closest hospital, at \ntheir discretion.  To ensure continuity of care, Plaintiffs’ physicians will communicate with their \noutside covering physician as well as with the emergency room physician treating the patient.  \nThe ER physician will involve Plaintiffs’ covering physician or the on-call physicians at the \nhospital as is necessary and appropriate.  This is consistent with the standard of care. \n28.  Complications from abortion are not only rare, but the few complications that do \noccur may not present until after a patient has left the clinic.  Plaintiffs provide their patients \n  8 \n\nupon discharge with phone numbers to call if they experience complications or have concerns at \nany time, day or night, after they have left the clinic.  In most cases, the patients’ concerns or \ncomplications can be addressed over the phone, by a qualified health care professional, or \nthrough a return visit to the clinic.  In the rare instances where additional or after hours care is \nrequired, Plaintiffs’ staff will refer the patient to a local emergency room, as is also consistent \nwith the standard of care.   \n29.  Between 40-60% of Plaintiffs’ patients  (depending on the  clinic) come from \noutside the clinic’s local area.  In the rare event of a complication that occurs after the patient has \nleft the clinic, the patient will be referred, consistent with the standard of care, to a hospital in her \narea, rather than a hospital near the clinic, making whether the abortion provider has staff \nprivileges at a hospital close to the clinic completely irrelevant. \n30.  There  is  an  increasing  divide  between  inpatient  and  outpatient  medicine  in \ncontemporary practice, with inpatient care handled more and more often by physicians who \nregularly or even exclusively provide care in hospital settings.  In the exceedingly rare event of \nan abortion complication that requires hospitalization, the physician who provides the abortion \nmay not in fact be the appropriate physician to manage her care in the hospital. \n31.  Requiring abortion providers to have hospital staff privileges, therefore, does not \nincrease patient safety and is medically unnecessary. \n32.  Medical evidence has shown that physicians with specialties other than obstetrics \nand gynecology, and in particular family medicine, can safely provide abortions. \nB.  The Staff Privileges Requirement and Its Impact \n33.  Despite  the  lack  of  medical  necessity  for  an  abortion  provider  to  have  staff \nprivileges at a local hospital, on April 9, 2013, Defendant Bentley signed HB 57 into law.  \n  9 \n\nSection 4(c) of HB 57 requires that every physician who provides abortion “shall have staff \nprivileges at an acute care hospital within the same standard metropolitan statistical area as the \nfacility  is  located  that  permit  him  or  her  to  perform  dilation  and  curettage,  laparotomy \nprocedures, hysterectomy, and any other procedures reasonably necessary to  treat  abortion-\nrelated complications.”   \n34.  HB 57 specifically states that it will become effective on the “first day of the third \nmonth following its passage and approval by the Governor.”  HB 57, § 20.  Thus, the staff \nprivileges requirement will become effective on July 1, 2013. \n35.  Violation of the staff privileges requirement carries significant criminal and civil \npenalties.  Any clinic “administrator” who “knowingly and willfully permits the facility to be \noperated in a manner” that violates the requirement is guilty of a Class C felony, punishable by \nimprisonment of between 1 and 10 years.  Id. § 12(c); Ala. Code. § 13A-5-6. \n36.  Violation of the requirement by Plaintiffs is “grounds for adverse licensure action, \nup to and including [clinic] license revocation,” HB 57 § 14(a), and violation of the requirement \nby any of their physicians, physician assistants, or nurses would subject those professionals to \nadverse consequences for their professional licenses.  Id. § 14(b). \n37.  In addition, Plaintiffs could be subject to civil suits for damages for failure to \ncomply with the requirement by “[a]ny person who can demonstrate personal injury, including \nphysical injury, emotional distress, or mental anguish.”  Id. § 13. \n38.  HB 57 was championed by anti-abortion politicians as a means to end abortion in \nAlabama. \n39.  Plaintiffs cannot comply with the staff privileges requirement.  For a variety of \nreasons that differ depending on the hospital, they cannot obtain local privileges.  Those reasons \n  10 \n\ninclude:  the  hospitals’  religious  opposition  to  abortion,  and  various  hospital  requirements \nunrelated to the ability of Plaintiffs’ physicians to provide safe abortion including, but not \nlimited to, minimum number of hospital admissions per year (which Plaintiffs’ physicians cannot \nsatisfy because the abortion complication rate is so low), requirements that all doctors with \nprivileges reside close enough to the hospital to be available for call (which Plaintiffs cannot \nsatisfy because none of their physicians live nearby, and no local physicians are willing to \nprovide abortions), and requirements at university hospitals that physicians obtain a faculty \nappointment first. \n40.  Also, one of PPSE’s physicians is a board-certified family practice physician.  In \naddition to the reasons stated above, that physician cannot comply with HB 57 because it \nrequires staff privileges to provide certain gynecological procedures that are not within a family \npractice physician’s scope of practice. \n41.  If  the  staff  privileges  requirement  takes  effect,  all  three  of  Plaintiffs’  health \ncenters will stop providing abortions as of July 1, 2013.  This will leave the Birmingham, \nMontgomery, and Mobile areas without a licensed abortion provider, and will leave only two \nremaining licensed abortion clinics in Alabama:  one in Huntsville and one in Tuscaloosa. \n42.  If  the  staff  privileges  requirement  takes  effect,  women  in  Montgomery, \nBirmingham, and all points south would be forced to travel at least 100 miles, and some more \nthan 200 miles – and most women must make that trip two times (the first for counseling and \nthen a second visit, at least 24 hours later, for the abortion) – to obtain an abortion in the state. \n43.  Alabama does not require other similarly situated health care providers to have \nstaff  privileges  at  a  local  hospital.    The  regulations  that  govern  physicians  who  provide \noutpatient procedures in their offices, including those that use general anesthesia, do not require \n  11 \n\nthem  to  have  admitting  privileges.    Ala.  Admin.  Code  r.  540-X-10-.01  et  seq.    Nor  are \nambulatory surgery centers, in which more complicated and riskier procedures are regularly \nperformed, required to have them for their physicians.  Id. r. 420-5-2-.01 et seq. \nC.  Irreparable Injury \n44.  Plaintiffs and their patients will suffer irreparable harm from the violation of their \nconstitutional rights if the staff privileges requirement goes into effect.  The staff privileges \nrequirement will force both Plaintiffs to cease to provide abortion as of July 1, 2013.   \n45.  RHS will be forced to close, causing Plaintiff Ayers to lose her business of more \nthan thirty years.  PPSE will be forced to cut back on staff and hours, and will be unable to \nprovide a critical service, causing them to lose patients and patient trust.  Plaintiffs have no \nadequate remedy at law. \n46.  The staff privileges requirement will jeopardize women’s health, shutting down \nthree-fifths  of  the  clinics  that  provide  abortions  without  medical  justification,  and  severely \nlimiting the availability of abortions in the state. \n47.  In some cases, women will be unable to obtain abortions altogether because of the \nloss of abortion services.  For other women, the additional travel required to the remaining \nlicensed providers in Tuscaloosa or Huntsville will increase the costs and delay the abortion.  \nAlthough abortion is one of the safest surgical procedures, the risk of complications (as well as \nthe cost of the procedure) increases as the pregnancy advances.  Given that the majority of \nPlaintiffs’ patients are low-income, the increased costs alone will make it impossible for some \nwomen to obtain an abortion. \n  12 \n\n48.  The  staff  privileges  requirement  will,  therefore,  irreparably  harm  Plaintiffs’ \npatients in two ways: threatening the health of women seeking abortions, and depriving women \nof their constitutionally protected right to obtain a pre-viability abortion. \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Plaintiffs’ Right to Due Process) \n49.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 48 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n50.  The staff privileges requirement of HB 57 violates the rights of Plaintiffs to due \nprocess  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution.    The  staff  privileges \nrequirement  makes  Plaintiffs’  clinic  licenses  contingent  on  their  physicians’  obtaining  staff \nprivileges  at  local  hospitals,  and  thereby  unconstitutionally  delegates  standardless  and \nunreviewable licensing authority to private parties.  \nCOUNT II \n(Substantive Due Process – Patients’ Right to Privacy) \n51.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 48 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n52.  The staff privileges requirement violates Plaintiffs’ patients’ right to liberty and \nprivacy as guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.  It is an unreasonable health regulation, and it has the unlawful purpose and \neffect of imposing an undue burden on women’s right to choose abortion. \n  13 \n\nCOUNT III \n(Substantive Due Process) \n53.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 48 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n54.  The staff privileges requirement violates the due process rights of Plaintiffs, their \nphysicians, staff members, and patients by requiring them to comply with the staff privileges \nrequirement, which is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest. \nCOUNT IV \n(Equal Protection) \n55.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 48 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n56.  The staff privileges requirement violates equal protection by treating Plaintiffs \ndifferently from other similarly situated health care providers without a sufficient state interest. \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n1.  declare  Section  4(c)  of  HB  57,  to  be  codified  at  Ala.  Code  § 26-23E-4(c), \nunconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n2.  enjoin Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in office from enforcing \nAla. Code § 26-23E-4(c) without bond; \n3.  award Plaintiffs costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n4.  grant Plaintiffs such other, further, and different relief as the Court may deem just and \nproper.  \n  14 \n\nDate: June 11, 2013 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n_______________________________ \nM.
