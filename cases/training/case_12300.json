It was filed on April 2, 2012, by five such couples, each lawfully married in South Africa, Vermont, New York, or Connecticut, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Represented by Immigration Equality and private pro bono counsel, plaintiffs sued the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS -- a component agency of DHS), seeking to compel recognition of their same-sex marriages and non-discriminatory adjudication of marriage-based immigrant benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Under DOMA, marriage \"means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.\" 1 U.S.C. &sect; 7. In each of the plaintiff couples, one spouse is American and the other foreign; if the marriage were not same-sex, the American spouse could petition for an immigrant visa for the foreign spouse and place the foreign spouse on the path to lawful permanent residence and citizenship. However, following DOMA's direction, USCIS has denied plaintiffs those immigration benefits. Plaintiffs argue that this denial is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, constituting discrimination on account of both sexual orientation and sex.</p>\r\n<p>The Obama administration has announced that in its view, DOMA is unconstitutional and has therefore declined to defend it in court (although the federal government continues to enforce the statute). Accordingly, a \"Bipartizan Legal Advisory Group\" (BLAG) has been appointed by the (Republican) House of Representatives to appear in cases like this one and defend the constitutionality of DOMA. BLAG filed papers in this case on May 31, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2012, the district court (Judge Amon) stayed proceedings in the case--including immigration enforcement against any of the plaintiffs--pending the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windsor v. United States</a>, No. 12 CV 2335 (2d Cir), a case already pending on appeal similarly challenging the constitutionality of DOMA.&nbsp;Since the government had declined to stay immigration enforcement, this was reported as a small victory by the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On July 8, 2013, following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windsor</a>, BLAG withdrew as intevenor-defendant. On August 26, 2013, after the Plaintiffs' notice of voluntary dismissal, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice.</p>",

RENAUD, Director, Vermont Service \nCenter, United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, \nDefendants. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nThis is a constitutional challenge to the so-called Defense of Marriage Act \n(\"DOMA\"), 1 U.S.C. § 7, as it applies to the immigration rights of lesbian and gay \nbi-national couples. \n1.  Plaintiffs are five committed, loving couples, lawfully married by the \ngovernment of South Africa and the States of Vermont, Connecticut, and New York.  In \neach couple, one spouse is an American citizen and the other spouse a foreign national. \nIf they were different-sex couples, the federal government would recognize the foreign \nspouse as an \"immediate relative\" of a United States citizen, thereby allowing the \n\nAmerican spouse to petition for an immigrant visa for the foreign spouse and place the \nforeign spouse on the path to lawful permanent residence and citizenship.  Solely because \nof DOMA and its unconstitutional discrimination against same-sex couples, however, \nthese Plaintiffs are being denied the immigration rights afforded to other similarly \nsituated bi-national couples.  This is an action to remedy that hateful, harmful, and \nunlawful discrimination. \n2.  Each of the Plaintiff couples were legally married, and there is no question \nthat each couple's marriage is recognized in the jurisdiction in which the American \nspouse resides.  For example, Frances Herbert and Takako Ueda were lawfully married in \n2011 in Vermont.  Thus, if Takako were a man instead of a woman, she would have \nalready been recognized as an \"immediate relative,\" allowing her to attain lawful \npermanent residence and to remain in the United States. \n3.  Section 3 of DOMA, however, upends that normal operation of the law. \nDOMA creates, for the first time in our nation's history, a federal definition of marriage \nthat excludes same-sex couples.  While DOMA is not an immigration statute, its \nrestrictive definition of marriage affects over 1,000 federal laws, including laws relating \nto immigration.  Thus, although federal immigration laws apply on their face to all \nlawfully married couples, same-sex couples, such as Frances and Takako, are denied their \nrights by operation of DOMA. \n4.  The discriminatory impact of DOMA is particularly acute in the \nimmigration context.  For immigration purposes, whether the federal government \nrecognizes a couple's marriage can determine whether a family may remain in the United \nStates and live together, or may be torn apart. \n\n5.  The ability to maintain their families together is, of course, of the highest \nconcern for the Plaintiff couples and for thousands of other bi-national couples in this \ncountry.  But the federal government also has set the preservation of families as a \nnational priority.  That is why the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") allows a \nUnited States citizen to file a petition with United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (\"USCIS\") on behalf of a foreign national spouse for classification as an \nimmediate relative and allows immediate relatives to apply for lawful permanent resident \nstatus and to remain lawfully in the United States.  There is no annual limit on the \nnumber of visas available to foreign national spouses of American citizens.  As a nation, \nwe want to keep families together, not rip them apart. \n6.  Those values have been reaffirmed repeatedly in federal laws and policies \nand in statements by members of Congress (Democrats and Republicans alike): \nFamily unification is the cornerstone of immigration to the \nUnited States.  Prolonging the separation of spouses  from \neach other, and from their children, is inconsistent with the \nprinciples  on which this nation  was founded.  .  .  .  The \nfamily  structure  is  one  of  our  great  Nation's  strongest \nassets. \n136 Cong. Rec. H8631 (daily ed. Oct. 2, 1990) (statement of Rep. McGrath (R)). \nThe reunification of families serves the national interest not \nonly through the humaneness of the policy itself, but also \nthrough the promotion of the public order and well-being of \nthe nation.  Psychologically  and  socially,  the  reunion  of \nfamily  members  with  their  close  relatives  promotes  the \nhealth and welfare of the United States. \nU.S. Select Comm'n on Immigr. and Refugee Pol'y, U.S. Immigration Policy and the \nNational Interest 112-13 (1981). \n7.  Ironically, it is the federal government that threatens to tear bi-national \nfamilies apart.  Because of DOMA, the federal government does not recognize the \n\nmarriages of same-sex couples and, therefore, denies them the immigration rights \nafforded to other married couples.  As a result, these couples live their lives at constant \nrisk of separation. \n8.  As described below, the five Plaintiff couples are like other married \ncouples.  They met, fell in love, and chose to build a life together.  They too committed \nthemselves to one another in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.  They have \nhonored and kept that commitment to one another.  They have chosen to be together and \nto make the United States their family's home.  However, because they are married to \nsomeone of the same sex, they are denied the federal immigration benefits to which \ndifferent-sex married couples are entitled.  They are at constant risk of being forced apart \nor forced to leave the United States to stay together. \n9.  Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to immigration laws, is unconstitutional. \nJURISDICTION \n10.  This action arises under the Constitution of the United States and the laws \nof the United States.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  This Court has authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and to grant mandamus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§1361. \nVENUE \n11.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (e) because \nthe defendants are officers and employees of the United States of America, and because \nPlaintiffs Edwin Blesch, Timothy Smulian, Santiago Ortiz and Pablo Garcia reside in this \njudicial district.  There is no real property involved in the action. \n\nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Edwin Blesch is a United States citizen.  He is married to Plaintiff \nTimothy Smulian, a native of South Africa.  They live together in Orient, New York. \n13.  Plaintiff Frances Herbert is a United States citizen.  She is married to \nPlaintiff Takako Ueda, a native of Japan.

They live together in New York, \nNew York. \n15.  Plaintiff Santiago Ortiz is a United States citizen.  He is married to \nPlaintiff Pablo Garcia, a native of Venezuela.  They live together in Elmhurst, New York. \n16.  Plaintiff Kelli Ryan is a United States citizen.  She is married to Plaintiff \nLucy Truman, a native of the United Kingdom.  They live together in Sandy Hook, \nConnecticut. \n17.  Defendant Eric H. Holder, Jr. is currently the Attorney General of the \nUnited States.  The Attorney General is the chief federal officer responsible for the \nenforcement of all federal statutes in accordance with the Constitution of the United \nStates. He is sued in his official capacity. \n18.  Defendant Janet Napolitano is currently the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is charged with the administration and \nenforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n19.  Defendant Alejandro Mayorkas is currently the Director of the United \nStates Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Director of the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services is charged with operating the immigration system \n\nand is ultimately responsible for granting immigration and citizenship benefits.  He is \nsued in his official capacity. \n20.  Defendant Robert M. Cowan is currently the Center Director of the United \nStates Citizenship and Immigration Services National Benefits Center.  Defendant Cowan \ndenied Plaintiff Frances Herbert's 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative and Plaintiff Takako \nUeda's 1-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.  He is sued \nin his official capacity. \n21.  Defendant Daniel M. Renaud is currently the Director of the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services Vermont Service Center.  Defendant Renaud \ndenied Plaintiff Edwin Blesch's 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative and Plaintiff Kelli \nRyan's 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTS PARTICULAR TO INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n22.  Plaintiffs are all U.S. citizens or the legal spouses of U.S. citizens, residing \nin New York, Connecticut, or Vermont.  Each of the Plaintiff couples is made up of one \nspouse who is a United States citizen and one spouse who is a foreign national.  All of the \nPlaintiff couples were legally married and are recognized as lawfully married spouses \nunder the laws of the state in which they live. \n23.  For each of the Plaintiff couples, the citizen spouse has petitioned for an \nimmigrant visa so that the foreign national spouse might become a lawful permanent \nresident of the United States.  These petitions would be considered on the merits if the \nspouses were of a different sex.  However, all of Plaintiffs' petitions have been or will be \ndenied solely by operation of Section 3 of DOMA because they are the same sex as their \nspouse. \n\nPlaintiffs Edwin Blesch and Timothy Smulian \n24.  Edwin and Tim are a dedicated and loving couple. They have been \ntogether for nearly thirteen years. They live together in Orient, New York. \n25.  Edwin, who was bom in 1940 in New York, worked as a professor of \nEnglish at Nassau Community College in Garden City, New York for more than thirty \nyears until he retired.  Tim, a citizen of South Africa and Great Britain, born in 1946, also \nis retired after working as an architectural designer, a film and television make-up artist \nand an environmental education officer. \n26.  Edwin and Tim met in Cape Town, South Africa on August 13, 1999. \nEdwin, who was 58 at the time, had been traveling in South Africa with friends.  When \nEdwin's friends had to leave unexpectedly, he decided to stay in South Africa and \nexplore Cape Town. He met Tim when he walked into a British tea and coffee emporium \nwhere Tim was working. They felt an immediate connection; after talking for hours, they \nmade plans to meet the following day. They spent the remainder of Edwin's stay \ntogether. \n27.  Edwin learned that he was HIV-positive in 1987 and discussed his status \nwith Tim the first time they met. Tim, himself HI V-negative, had been working as an \nAIDS counselor for a number of years before he met Edwin. Edwin's HIV status did not \nchange the way Tim felt for Edwin. \n28.  Before he met Tim, Edwin had never had a relationship where he lived \nwith anyone, though he had longed for a committed relationship all of his life.  When he \nretired, he resigned himself to being single. But when Edwin met Tim, he knew that his \nlife had changed. Tim had also believed he would not meet anyone with whom he would \nwant to share his life. He was in the process of buying a house in the country in South \n\nAfrica and planned to live out his retirement there alone.  When he met Edwin, he knew \nhis life had changed as well. \n29.  Unfortunately, Edwin had to leave South Africa soon after he and Tim \nmet.  When Edwin returned to the United States, he contacted Tim immediately and \ninvited him to visit.  Having shared briefly in Tim's life in South Africa, Edwin wanted to \nshare his own life in the United States with Tim.  Tim came for a visit and stayed for ten \ndays. \n30.  After Tim's visit, Edwin knew that he had to find a way to be with Tim, \nbut they did not want to violate any of the United States' immigration laws.  Therefore, \nfor each of the next eleven years, Tim and Edwin spent six months in the United States \nand then six months abroad. \n31.  After successfully petitioning their town on Long Island to recognize \ndomestic partnerships, Edwin and Tim proudly became one of the first couples in the \ntown to register as domestic partners on June 13, 2005. Then when Suffolk County \nbegan registering domestic partnerships two years later, Edwin and Tim were, again, one \nof the first couples in line.  They married in South Africa on August 13, 2007, shortly \nafter marriage equality passed in that country and on the eighth anniversary of the day \nthey met.  Their South African marriage is legally recognized in their home state of New \nYork, and would be recognized by the United States but for DOMA. \n32.  A few years ago, multiple health conditions including HIV/AIDS, \ncomplications of HIV therapies, cardiac conditions and degenerative spine disease began \nto take a toll on Edwin's health.  He was no longer able to spend six months in South \nAfrica because it was too far from his doctors.  To continue to comply with United States \n\nimmigration law, Edwin and Tim began to spend much of each year in Canada.  Because \nEdwin's Medicare does not cover him in Canada, however, he was twice forced to return \nto the United States for necessary medical care. Tim, heartbroken, could not accompany \nEdwin to his doctors (as he always does), fearful he would be denied entry to the United \nStates during those six-month periods. \n33.  On March 29,2011, Edwin filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative with \nUSCIS on behalf of Tim, his legal spouse.  On March 14, 2012, USCIS notified Edwin \nthat his petition was denied, stating:  \"DOMA applies as a matter of federal law whether \nor not your marriage is recognized under state law. Your spouse is not a person of the \nopposite sex.  Therefore, under the DOMA, your petition must be denied.\" \nPlaintiffs Frances Herbert and Takako Ueda \n34.  Frances and Takako are a loving and committed married couple who live \ntogether in the Dummerston, Vermont home that they have shared for eleven years. \n35.  Frances was bom in Michigan in 1960 and has been living in Vermont for \nthe past twenty-two years.  She works as an in-home elder-care provider. \n36.  Takako was bom in Japan in 1955. In 1979, Takako left Japan to come to \nthe United States to study at Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  It was during \nher first Fall semester at Aquinas College that Takako met Frances, and their lives \nchanged forever. \n37.  Frances and Takako shared a strong bond from the moment they met. \nSince Takako was far from home, Frances welcomed Takako into her own family, \ninviting her to family events and holidays.  Their relationship grew stronger as time \npassed. \n\n38.  Sadly, when Takako graduated from college in 1983, she was forced to \nreturn to Japan and leave Frances. Although they were far apart, Frances and Takako did \nnot forget about each other. Upon Takako's departure, Frances began writing Takako \nletters. She would continue to write until she and Takako were reunited in the United \nStates years later. \n39.  Upon returning to Japan, Takako, bound to family and societal pressure, \nmarried a man. But she never stopped thinking of Frances; she never stopped loving her. \n40.  Frances, too, could not stop thinking of Takako. In 1996, when Frances \nwas about to undergo open heart surgery, Frances realized that she longed to have \nTakako in her life and started writing to Takako more fervently.  In 1999, Frances went to' \nJapan to visit Takako, needing to see the woman she loved. \n41.  During the three weeks Frances was in Japan, the connection that the two \nwomen felt toward one another was rekindled. Those three weeks changed how they \nwould live the next twelve years. \n42.  Takako divorced her husband to be with Frances. In 2000, twenty years \nafter they first met, Takako left her family, friends, country and culture behind and came \nto the United States on a B1/B2 visitor visa. \n43.  In 2001, Takako was granted Fl student status, and she began nine years \nof college study.  She graduated with an associate's degree with honors in 2004 and \ngraduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree from Keene State College in May \n2010.  She then entered a twelve-month period of Optional Practical Training (\"OPT\"). \n44.  The couple held a commitment ceremony on September 30, 2000, \nsurrounded by family and friends.  Among those participating were Frances's parents and \n10 \n\nsister, who traveled from Michigan. The ceremony was filled with joy and love. On \nApril 26, 2011, Frances and Takako legally married each other in their home in \nDummerston, Vermont. This simple ceremony, too, was deeply meaningful, celebrating \nFrances and Takako's eleven years together as a family. \n45.  On September 2, 2011, Frances filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative \nwith USCIS on behalf of Takako. That same day, Takako filed an 1-485 Application to \nRegister Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The Petition and Application were both \nfiled within the grace period following the expiration of Takako's OPT status. \n46.  On December 1, 2011, USCIS notified Frances that her petition was \ndenied, stating: \"DOMA applies as a matter of federal law whether or not your marriage \nis recognized under state law. Your spouse is not a person of the opposite sex. \nTherefore, under the DOMA your petition must be denied.\" Because it was predicated \nupon approval of the 1-130 Petition, Takako's 1-485 Application was also denied. \nPlaintiffs Heather Morgan and Maria del Mar Verdguo \n47.  Heather and Maria del Mar (\"Mar\") are a devoted and loving couple. \nThey are newly weds, but have known each other for fourteen years. \n48.  Heather was bom in 1976 and raised in New Jersey.  She holds a \nbachelor's degree in psychology from Cornell University, graduating in 1998. She is a \nmarketing director for a global non-profit organization in New York. \n49.  Mar is a native of Madrid, Spain, where she was bom in 1969. In Madrid, \nshe worked for a Spanish newspaper company for sixteen years, then for Spain's leading \nbusiness school and for the American company, General Electric. Mar currently works in \nmarketing for a Spanish-language newspaper in New York. \n11 \n\n50.  Heather and Mar met in 1998, when Heather moved to Madrid to teach \nEnglish after college.  They met through a mutual friend who asked Mar to look after \nHeather.  Mar and her friends immediately accepted Heather and treated her like an old \nfriend.  Mar in particular took a special interest in Heather.  Mar would often invite \nHeather to stay with her and her family for weekends. \n51.  After Heather left Spain and moved back to New Jersey, she and Mar \nstayed in touch and remained close. That following summer, in 1999, Mar came to visit \nHeather and her family in New Jersey for three weeks.  Heather's family immediately \nwelcomed Mar, just as Mar's family had welcomed Heather.  During the ensuing years, \nHeather always took her vacations with Mar and their friends.  Although separated by \ndistance and circumstance, the two remained incredibly close. \n52.  In January 2007, Mar came to the United States to study English.  For the \nfirst time, she and Heather were able to spend time together on a day-to-day basis while \nHeather worked and Mar studied.  Although at this time they were still just friends, it was \nclear that their relationship was far more intimate than just friendship.  Heather and Mar \nspent all of their significant moments together, talked regularly, and took care of each \nother.  Simply, they loved each other. \n53.  In May 2007, Mar returned to Spain to start a new job.  The following \nsummer—as she always did when she had time for vacation—Heather returned to Spain \nto see Mar.  The two shared a wonderful few weeks together. \n54.  After Heather returned to the United States, though, she felt differently \nthan she usually did after visiting Spain.  While she usually was energized and upbeat, \n12 \n\nthis time she felt a profound longing to go back. In October 2008, Heather returned to \nMadrid and to Mar.  It was on this trip that Heather and Mar realized they were in love. \n55.  In November 2008, anxious to see Heather, Mar came to New York and \nthe two were able to spend time together as a couple for the first time. In February 2009, \nMar returned to the United States on a tourist visa and then decided to stay and go to \nschool. In February 2011, Mar was fortunate to find an employer to sponsor her for a \ntemporary Hl-B skilled worker visa, which she currently holds. \n56.  With Mar in New York, their relationship blossomed. All of their friends \nand family observed how they lit up when they were together. Everyone immediately \nknew what had taken Heather and Mar ten years to discover—that they are soul-mates. \n57.  Heather could not wait to propose to Mar, which she did in November \n2009. On August 19, 2011, in front of forty of their closest friends and family, Heather \nand Mar were married in New York City by a Rabbi. It was one of the best days of their \nlives. \n58.  For Mar, Heather is her dream come true. She is \"home\" to her. Heather \nconsiders herself the luckiest person in the world to have Mar in her life. Now married, \nthey are longing to grow their family.  As Heather says, \"Mar is magical with children \nand it would be an injustice for Mar not to have kids.\" Unfortunately, Heather and Mar \nhave been forced to put those plans on hold because they are not sure whether they will \nbe able to raise their children together in the United States. \n59.  On March 28, 2012, Heather filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative \nwith USCIS on behalf of Mar, her legal spouse. Because of DOMA, this Petition is \ncertain to be denied. \n13 \n\nPlaintiffs Santiago Ortiz and Pablo Garcia \n60.  Santiago and Pablo have maintained a loving and committed relationship \nfor over twenty years. \n61.  Santiago is a Puerto Rican American who was born in New York City in \n1955. He worked as a school psychologist with the Rochester City School District, the \nNew York City School District and for a time at Island Academy at Rikers Island. He \nholds a bachelor's degree from the University of Puerto Rico and a master's degree in \nschool psychology from Alfred University.  Santiago retired in 1995. \n62.  Pablo was bom in 1960 in Venezuela. In Caracas, he worked as a \ncopywriter in an advertising agency and as a playwright.  In New York, he writes \nSpanish-language plays for local theaters. He has an associate's degree, a bachelor's \ndegree and a master's degree and is currently in his second year at the Graduate Center of \nthe City University of New York working toward his Ph.D. He volunteers teaching a \nSpanish GED class at Columbia University and volunteers with a number of arts \nprograms targeting youth. \n63.  Pablo and Santiago met in 1991 in Caracas. They became enamored with \neach other immediately. \n64.  Soon after meeting, Pablo accompanied Santiago to Puerto Rico to meet \nSantiago's family.  Santiago then returned to Caracas with his mother to meet Pablo's \nfamily.  Although they were both afraid of how their families would react to their \nrelationship, all agreed that the two men were made for each other and accepted them \nimmediately. \n65.  Santiago learned that he was living with HIV in 1987. Pablo is HIV-\nnegative. At the time they met, no effective treatments were available for HIV. \n14 \n\nSantiago, therefore, knew that he could die, and he wanted more than anything for Pablo \nto be with him during the rest of his life.  Santiago asked Pablo to come to New York, \npromising Pablo's mother that he would take care of him. To be with the man he loved, \nPablo left his family, friends and culture behind. \n66.  Living together as a couple, their romance blossomed, and Pablo extended \nhis lawful stay in the United States. After that time expired, the couple made the difficult \ndecision to have Pablo remain in the United States without an authorized immigration \nstatus. That means, for Pablo, that he cannot go to Venezuela and visit his mother or the \nrest of his family.  He could not attend his father's funeral, or visit his grave. He has \ngiven that up out of love for his spouse. Santiago, in return, has made the trip to \nVenezuela on Pablo's behalf, bringing Pablo's love and respect to his family from whom \nhe is separated because of DOMA. \n67.  In 1993, they registered as domestic partners in New York City. They \nwere legally married in Stamford, Connecticut on May 2, 2011. \n68.  On March 29, 2012, Santiago filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative \nwith USCIS on behalf of Pablo, his legal spouse. That same day, Pablo filed an 1-485 \nApplication to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. Because of DOMA, the \nPetition and Application are certain to be denied. \nPlaintiffs Kelli Ryan and Lucy Truman \n69.  Kelli and Lucy have been a couple for over eleven years. They are both \nhighly educated, talented and respected immunologists. \n70.  Kelli was bom in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1972. She holds a bachelor of \nscience from Marquette University and a doctorate in immunology from the Department \nof Microbiology and Immunology at Emory University. After obtaining her doctorate, \n15 \n\nKelli relocated to the United Kingdom for postdoctoral training at the University of \nEdinburgh and later for further training at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, \nUnited Kingdom.  She is currently a Senior Scientist at Boehringer Ingelheim \nPharmaceuticals in Ridgefield, Connecticut. \n71.  Lucy was bom in the United Kingdom in 1968.  She holds a bachelor of \nscience in biochemistry and physiology from the University of London, a bachelor of \nmedicine from the University of Southampton (UK), and a doctorate in philosophy in \nimmunology from the University of Edinburgh.  Currently, Lucy is a Postdoctoral Fellow \nin Human Translational Immunology at Yale University, where she is the recipient of an \nInternational Fellowship from the UK charity, Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research. \n72.  Kelli and Lucy first met in Edinburgh, Scotland in 2000 when Kelli was \ncompleting her postdoctoral training and Lucy was training as an ear, nose and throat \nsurgeon. As fate would have it, they started working in the same lab on the same day, \nwhere they shared a very small office with two other researchers. They quickly \ndeveloped a friendship, which over time evolved into a romantic relationship. By 2001, \nthey were a couple. \n73.  In 2004, Kelli and Lucy moved to Newcastle, United Kingdom. Eager to \nformalize their already strong commitment to each other, they entered into a civil \npartnership on July 20, 2006. For Kelli, Lucy and their friends and family, this was a \ncelebration filled with happiness and love. It was held in an old maritime building in \nTynemouth, England.  Lucy's nephews were the ring bearers and Lucy's sister helped \norganize the flowers.  They continued their celebration into the weekend at Alnmouth, a \n16 \n\nsmall town on the Northumberland coast, where they danced and enjoyed the company of \ntheir loved ones. \n74.  In 2007, Kelli was offered a job in Connecticut.  Lucy decided to remain \nin the United Kingdom to finish her studies and training.  Samson, their brown-spotted \ncat, went with Kelli to Connecticut, but not before Kelli and Lucy obtained a European \nUnion pet passport for him, listing both of them as his owners. \n75.  During their time apart, Lucy visited Kelli often.  With Lucy's frequent \ntravels to the United States, she feared each time that she would not be allowed entry to \nbe with her partner. \n76.  In May 2009, Lucy came to the United States with a B1/B2 visitor visa. \nShe then received a post-doctoral fellowship at Yale and was granted a temporary H1B \nskilled worker visa in July 2009. \n77.  On March 18, 2010, Lucy and Kelli were legally married in Newtown, \nConnecticut. \n78.  Throughout their friendship, courtship, civil union and marriage, Kelli and \nLucy have lived their lives as any other loving, committed couple.  They have enjoyed \neach other in good times—^vacations in Belgium, Switzerland and Spain—and supported \neach other in bad times—the loss of Kelli's mother following a long fight with cancer. \nThey have become a part of each other's families and have been embraced by each \nother's friends. \n79.  Lucy's buoyant exuberance perfectly complements Kelli's calm, gentle \nnature.  Their friends say that they are perfect for each other.  Now, they seek only to \nremain together, legally, in the United States. \n17 \n\n80.  On November 14, 2011, Kelli filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative \nwith USCIS on Lucy's behalf. On March 27,2012, USCIS notified Kelli that her petition \nwas denied, stating: \"DOMA applies as a matter of federal law whether or not your \nmarriage is recognized under state law. Your spouse is not a person of the opposite sex. \nTherefore, under the DOMA your petition must be denied.\" \n*  *  * \n81.  As couples, Kelli and Lucy, Edwin and Tim, Frances and Takako, \nSantiago and Pablo, and Heather and Mar are as different from each other as are any \ncouples. And they are as similar to each other as are all couples. They love each other, \nwith all the joy and pain that love encompasses. They are married, with all of the \npromise that marriage brings. Unlike married, different-sex couples, however, they face \na risk of being torn apart by the United States government, perhaps forced to live \nseparately or to leave the country. DOMA threatens their marriages while purporting to \n\"defend\" marriage.  It does violence not only to these five couples, not only to the \ninstitution of marriage, but to the Constitution of the United States. \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \nThe Relevant Immigration Framework \n82.  Under the INA, United States citizens may petition for their \"children, \nspouses, and parents\" to be classified as \"immediate relatives,\" who are therefore eligible \nfor an immigrant visa and lawful permanent residence in the United States.  8 U.S.C. §§ \n1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1154. \n83.  To petition for an immigrant visa on behalf of his or her spouse, the \nUnited States citizen must file an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative with USCIS. 8 C.F.R. \n§ 204.1(a)(1) (2009). If the adjudicator \"determines that the facts stated in the petition \n18 \n\nare true and that the alien in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate \nrelative,\" then the adjudicator \"shall.. . approve the petition.\"  8 U.S.C. §1154(b). \nTherefore, an 1-130 is approved where the foreign national is a bona fide \"spouse\" of an \nAmerican citizen under the INA.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b), 1154(b), (c). \n84.  The INA does not define the term \"spouse.\"  Rather, an individual's \nmarital status typically is governed by the law where the marriage was celebrated.  See \nMatter ofDela  Cruz, 141. & N. Dec. 686 (BIA 1974) (\"the law is clear .. . [t]he validity \nof a marriage is generally governed by the law of the place of celebration\"). \n85.  At the same time or after the citizen spouse files the Form 1-130 Petition, \nthe foreign national spouse may file a Form 1-485 Application to Register Permanent \nResidence or Adjust Status in order to gain status as a lawful permanent resident of the \nUnited States. See 8 C.F.R. § 245.2. The foreign national's status may be adjusted if: \n\"(1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive \nan immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) \nan immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\" 8 \nU.S.C. § 1255(a); see also 8 C.F.R. § 245.1. \n86.  Lawful permanent residency allows a foreign national to reside in the \nUnited States, to work here, and to travel in and out of the country with limited \nrestrictions.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(20); 8 C.F.R. §§ 274a. 12(a)(1), 316.5(c)(1).  As the \nname implies, that status is permanent—a lawful permanent resident may remain in the \nUnited States indefinitely, so long as the person abides by the nation's immigration laws. \n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(20).  Three years after obtaining lawful permanent residence, the \nspouse of a United States citizen may apply to naturalize to become a United States \n19 \n\ncitizen.  8 U.S.C. § 1430(a). The naturalization statute again recognizes the primacy of \nthe marital relationship by reducing the time to apply from five years to three for spouses \nof United States citizens. 8 U.S.C. § 1427(a); 8 U.S.C. § 1430(a). \nThe Defense of Marriage Act \n87.  The federal government defers to the states' determinations of whether a \ncouple is validly married, because marriage is within the states' core powers. See Elk \nGrove Unified Sch Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1,12 (2004); Ankenbrandt v. Richards, \n504 U.S. 689, 716 (1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring). \n88.  When DOMA was enacted in 1996, it changed that longstanding practice, \nbut only for same-sex couples.  Specifically, Section 3 of DOMA provides that \"[i]n \ndetermining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or \ninterpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \nword 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband \nand wife, and the word 'spouse5 refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a \nhusband or a wife.\"  1 U.S.C. § 7. \n89.  When DOMA was enacted, six justifications were given for this unequal \ntreatment of gay men and lesbians: (1) defending and nurturing the institution of \nheterosexual marriage; (2) promoting and encouraging heterosexuality; (3) protecting \n\"democratic self-governance\"; (4) preserving government resources; (5) promoting moral \ndisapproval of homosexuality; and (6) encouraging \"responsible procreation\" and child-\nrearing.  H.R. Rep. No. 104-664(1996). None of these purported justifications provides \neven a rational basis for DOMA, nor is there any other rational basis for the law. \n90.  Congress's proffered interests in defending heterosexual marriage and \npromoting heterosexuality are both invalid and illogical. Tradition alone cannot provide \n20 \n\na legitimate basis for a discriminatory law. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 326 (1993). \nEven if it could, DOMA does not promote heterosexuality or \"heterosexual marriage,\" as \nDOMA confers no rights on different-sex couples.  It gives them nothing.  It just denies \nrights to same-sex couples. \n91.  DOMA likewise cannot be justified by claims that it protects state \nsovereignty or preserves scarce resources.  DOMA does just the opposite.  It eliminates \nstates' longstanding sovereign power to define marriage, and creates inconsistency \nbetween the federal and state definitions of marriage.  The Congressional Budget Office \nalso has recognized that DOMA does not save the federal government even one penny. \nInstead, DOMA costs the federal government billions of dollars.  Cong. Budget Office, \nU.S. Cong., The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages  1 (June \n21,2004),  http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/55xx/ \ndoc5 5 59/06-2 l-samesexmarriage.pdf. \n92.  Moral disapproval of homosexuality—though surely the real motive \nbehind DOMA—cannot serve as a legitimate basis for a discriminatory law.  See \nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 577-78 (2003); Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631-35 \n(1996).  As the Supreme Court explained in Romer, \"if the constitutional conception of \n'equal protection of the laws' means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare .. \n.  desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate \ngovernmental interest.\"  517 U.S. at 634-35 (quoting Dep 't ofAgric.  v. Moreno, 413 U.S. \n528,534(1973)). \n93.  Finally, DOMA does nothing to promote either \"responsible procreation\" \nor responsible child-rearing.  To the contrary, DOMA injures children by denying them \n21 \n\nthe safety and security of having the marriages of their parents federally recognized, and, \nfor bi-national couples, possibly forcing their parents apart. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n94.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n95.  As a direct result of DOMA, USCIS treats legally married same-sex \ncouples differently than legally married different-sex couples.  Solely because theirs are \nmarriages between two people of the same sex, the United States citizen Plaintiffs were \nor will be denied the 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative they filed on behalf of their same-\nsex, foreign-national spouses. In addition, solely because theirs are marriages between \ntwo people of the same sex, the foreign-national Plaintiffs were or will be denied a Form \n1-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. Had they been \ndifferent-sex couples, Plaintiffs' 1-130 Petitions and 1-485 Applications would have been \nconsidered on the merits and would have been granted. Accordingly, DOMA \ndiscriminates on the basis of sexual orientation. \n96.  Because DOMA, as applied by USCIS, requires this disparity of treatment \nwith regard to the adjudication of Plaintiffs' Petitions for Alien Relative and, ultimately, \nApplications for Lawful Permanent Residence Status for the foreign-national Plaintiffs, it \ncreates a classification that singles out one class of valid marriages—those of same-sex \ncouples—and subjects persons in those marriages to differential treatment compared to \nother similarly situated couples. This disparate treatment is without justification and in \nviolation of the right of equal protection secured by the Fifth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. \n22 \n\n97.  Additionally, DOMA violates the right of equal protection secured by the \nFifth Amendment to the Constitution because it discriminates on the basis of sex. \nDOMA recognizes marriages where one spouse is a man and the other spouse is a \nwoman. But where both spouses are women, or both spouses are men, DOMA prevents \nfederal recognition of these valid marriages. For example, if Edwin were female instead \nof male, he would have had his 1-130 petition for his spouse Tim granted.  Because the \nonly difference between different-sex and same-sex bi-national spouses is the sex of the \nspouses, DOMA unlawfully discriminates on the basis of an individual's sex. \nPRAYERS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n1.  Declare DOMA, 1 U.S.C. § 7, unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs. \n2.  Enjoin the Defendants from continuing to discriminate against Plaintiffs \nby treating them differently based on their sexual orientation and sex. \n3.  Compel USCIS to adjudicate the 1-130 petition of Santiago Ortiz on behalf \nof his spouse, Pablo Garcia, on the merits, without regard to sex or sexual orientation. \n4.  Compel USCIS to adjudicate the 1-130 petition of Heather Morgan on \nbehalf of her spouse, Maria del Mar Verdugo, on the merits, without regard to sex or \nsexual orientation. \n5.  Compel USCIS to reopen and re-adjudicate the 1-130 petition of Edwin \nBlesch on behalf of his spouse, Timothy Smulian, on the merits, without regard to sex or \nsexual orientation. \n23 \n\n6.  Compel USCIS to reopen and re-adjudicate the 1-130 petition of Frances \nHerbert on behalf of her spouse, Takako Ueda, on the merits, without regard to sex or \nsexual orientation. \n7.  Compel USCIS to reopen and re-adjudicate the 1-130 petition of Kelli \nRyan on behalf of her spouse, Lucy Truman, on the merits, without regard to sex or \nsexual orientation. \n8.  Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable and \nproper. \n9.
