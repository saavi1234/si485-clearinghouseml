    "summary": "<p>On February 8, 1980, prisoners at the Sonoma County Jail in Santa Rosa filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, against the County of Sonoma. The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the constitutionality of their conditions of confinement. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  We have limited documentation of this case - only the docket is available to us, and it does not include entries for the first decade of litigation -- but we do have the following information:</p><p>The District Court appointed Thomas Lonergan as a monitor for this case in December 1982 and he served in that capacity until the Court dismissed the case in June 1994. <i>Madrid v. Gomez</i>, 889 F. Supp. 1146, 1282 n.231 (N.D. Cal. 1995).</p><p>In 1985, the parties reached a settlement. Lynn J. Lund, Mark J. Morrise & Alton Jordan, Nat'l Inst. of Corr., 136 Nebraska Jail Bulletin 9 (1997), <i>available at</i> http://www.ncc.ne.gov/pdf/jail_standards/jail_bulletins/136.pdf. It covered, among other things, disciplinary actions, classification decisions, medical treatment, mental health services (including use of force by staff, suicides, attempt suicides, and in-custody deaths), recreation, general living conditions, and adequacy of food, with the monitor tasked with ensuring compliance. Curricula Vitae of Patrick T. Maher, <i>available at</i> http://ca-sanbernardinoschools.civicplus.com/archives/152/June%2008%202011%20Agenda%20package.pdf. The Court also awarded the plaintiffs $2,000,000 in attorneys' fees. Lund et al., <i>supra</i>, at 9.</p><p>The docket informs us that construction of a new jail was also a part of the litigation: on August 14, 1991, the Court (Judge Thelton E. Henderson) ordered the County to complete occupation of the new jail by October 18 of that year or be fined $8,000 per day of lateness. The Court also issued an order regarding double celling, but the exact content of that order is unclear from the docket.</p><p>On June 22, 1994, the Court (Judge Henderson) dismissed the case with prejudice and declared all prior orders and judgments to be of no further effect, presumably because a new jail had been constructed and occupied.</p>",
