    "summary": "<p>On October 23, 1990, several prisoners at the Tuolumne County Jail filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California against the County of Tuolumne. The plaintiffs, represented by the Prisoner Rights Union and private counsel, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, challenging the constitutionality of their conditions of confinement. Specifically, they alleged problems with overcrowding, cleanliness, ventilation, heating and cooling, exercise, the law library, prompt determination of probable cause, and equal access to programs for female prisoners. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and on October 29, 1990, also applied for a temporary restraining order.</p><p>On December 18, 1990, the District Court (Magistrate Judge John F. Moulds) directed the County to submit a plan within 10 days to ensure effective communication between prisoners and correctional officers and to submit a proposed order allowing prisoners adequate access to law library. </p><p>On the same day, Magistrate Judge Moulds submitted a report recommending that the Court certify the plaintiffs' proposed class, enjoin the County from bedding prisoners on the floor or adding additional beds to the jail pending the outcome of the case, and authorize the sheriff to release prisoners when the jail is within 10 beds of being filled and not to accept new prisoners when all beds are filled. In all other respects, he recommended that preliminary relief be denied. The Court (Senior Judge Edward D. Price) adopted the report in full on January 16, 1991.</p><p>On December 26, 1990, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Later, on July 9, 1991, the County filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  On February 25, 1992, the Court (Magistrate Judge Moulds) issued an order on the motions pending before it. It ordered that the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on the issue of the law library be granted in part but that their motion for a temporary restraining order be denied. It also ordered that the County's motion for partial summary judgment on the issues of general jail population, exercise, and prompt determination of probable cause be granted, but that the motion be otherwise denied.</p><p>On March 6, 1992, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's grant of summary judgment to the County on the issue of exercise, and on April 21, the Court (Magistrate Judge Moulds) granted that motion, leaving that issue for trial.  The trial began on May 4, 1992, and lasted twelve days.</p><p>A letter to the Court from the County on September 10, 1992, indicates that ventilation and heating and cooling systems in the jail had been improved.</p><p>Meanwhile, the parties had begun negotiations to settle in March 1992, and they lodged a settlement agreement with the Court on December 8, 1994. The Court (Magistrate Judge Moulds) approved the settlement (the content of which is unfortunately unclear from the docket) on March 22, 1995,  dismissed the case on April 5, and ordered the County to pay plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $167,437.19 on March 27, 1996.</p><p>The Court (Magistrate Judge Moulds) had also issued an order directing the County to make certain additions to the law library at the jail on December 21, 1994. The County appealed this order, and on March 27, 1997, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit (Judge James R. Browning, Judge William C. Canby, Jr., and Judge Cynthia H. Hall) vacated the decision and remanded to the District Court to determine whether there was actual injury to the plaintiffs and to limit the scope of its relief to that injury. <i>Ercoli v. Cnty. of Tuolumne</i>, 110 F.3d 68 (9th Cir. 1997).</p><p>In response, the parties reached a settlement on the issue of the law library, and the Court (Magistrate Judge Moulds) approved it on November 26, 1997, awarding a further $130,000 to plaintiffs in attorneys' fees.  The case was definitively closed on February 6, 1998.</p>",

Try out the HTML to PDF API pdfcrowd.com\n\n2 Plaintiffs, Donald Ercoli and other prisoners at the Tuolumne County Jail (the\n\"Jail\"), filed a class action that alleged, among other things, that Tuolumne\ninterfered with Plaintiffs' right of access to court by not providing an adequate law\nlibrary at the Jail. Tuolumne appeals the district court's order that directed it to\nimprove the law library, contending that the order is overly broad. Plaintiffs cross-\nappeal, contending that the order is too limited to redress the law library's deficits.\nWe remand for reconsideration in light of Lewis v. Casey, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (1996),\nand for such further proceedings as the district court deems appropriate.\n3 We need not set forth the facts because the parties are familiar with them.\nANALYSIS\n4 We review the scope of the district court's grant of injunctive relief for an abuse\nof discretion or an application of erroneous legal principles. Securities & Exch.\nComm'n v. Interlink Data Network, 77 F.3d 1201, 1204 (9th Cir.1996).\n5 Pursuant to our request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on the\nimpact of Lewis v. Casey, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (1996). Casey affects Plaintiffs' requisite\nshowing of \"actual injury\" and the permissible scope of the district court's order.\nSee id. at 2180, 2183.\nActual Injury\n6 Under Casey, a prisoner plaintiff must now show actual injury in order to have\nstanding to assert a claim even if it involves a \"core\" Bounds requirement. Id. at\n2180; see Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 827-28 (1977). The Court in Casey\nindicated that, in order to show such actual injury, a plaintiff must demonstrate that\n\"the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his\nefforts to pursue a legal claim.\" Casey, 116 S.Ct. at 2180. The Court further clarified\nthat the frustrated legal claim must be one that attacks the plaintiff's sentence\n(directly or collaterally) or challenges the conditions of confinement. Id. at 2182.\n7 Plaintiffs here have not shown actual injury under Casey. Plaintiffs principally\nhave relied on affidavits stating that inmates did not receive requested materials,\nopen in browser PRO version Are you a developer? Try out the HTML to PDF API pdfcrowd.com\n\nnot stating that specific legal claims have been frustrated. See id. at 2180. This\ndeficiency is understandable, however, in light of the litigating posture of this case;\nPlaintiffs could not have known, pre-Casey, that they would need to make such a\nshowing. The district court's decision was rendered on the basis that no showing of\ndirect injury was required. We therefore remand to the district court for further\nproceedings as it deems appropriate in light of Casey 's actual injury requirements.\nScope of the District Court's Order\n8 The Court in Casey also indicated the appropriate scope of injunctive relief in\naccess-to-court cases. Id. at 2183. The Court asserted that \"[t]he remedy must of\ncourse be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury-in-fact that the\nplaintiff has established.\" Id. Therefore, the district court should, if Plaintiffs on\nremand make the requisite showing of actual injury, limit its order specifically to\nthe redress of that injury.\n9 ORDER VACATED; REMANDED.\n10 The parties will bear their own costs on appeal.\n11 CYNTHIA HOLCOMB HALL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n12 Because I do not believe the plaintiffs here have standing to bring this suit, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n13 Lewis v. Casey, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (1996), clarifies the standing requirements for a\nconstitutional challenge such as the one here. In Casey, the Supreme Court held\nthat a prisoner alleging constitutional deprivation of access to the courts must\ndemonstrate actual injury, and that the remedy ordered must be limited to\nrectifying the actual injury demonstrated.\n14 In Casey, the Court disclaims those statements in Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817\n(1977), that suggest that prisoners have a general right to discover grievances and\nlitigate effectively. Casey, 116 S.Ct. at 2181. An inmate claiming a constitutionally\ndeficient law library \"cannot establish relevant actual injury simply by establishing\nopen in browser PRO version Are you a developer? Try out the HTML to PDF API pdfcrowd.com\n\nthat his prison's law library or legal assistance program is sub-par in some\ntheoretical sense.\" Rather, he must \"demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in\nthe library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\"\nId. at 2180. I agree with the majority's conclusion that the plaintiffs here have not\nshown \"actual injury\" under Casey. I disagree, however, with the conclusion that\nthis deficiency in the plaintiffs' suit warrants remand.\n15 Casey makes clear that its \"actual injury\" requirement derives from the \"case or\ncontroversy\" standing requirement. 116 S.Ct. at 2179. Thus, I disagree with the\nmajority's statement that the plaintiff's deficiency is \"understandable\" because they\n\"could not have known, pre-Casey, that they would need to make such a showing.\"\nIn fact, both plaintiffs and defendants did address the issue of actual injury in their\nbriefs to both the district court and this court. In doing so, the plaintiffs made clear\nthat they base their suit only on generalized inadequacies. When plaintiffs argued to\nthe district court that they had demonstrated actual injury, they offered no\nevidence of specific instances of denial to the courts, but only referred to the\ngeneral inadequacy of the law library and of access to it. Moreover, the relief the\ndistrict court ordered deals entirely with the general \"constitutional adequacy\" of\nthe law library. Casey mandates that any relief must \"be limited to the inadequacy\nthat produced the injury-in-fact that the plaintiff has established. 116 S.Ct. at 2183.\nNone of the relief ordered by the district court redresses an injury-in-fact because\nno injury-in-fact was shown.\n16 Nothing in the record of this case supports the contention that plaintiffs have the\nrequisite standing to bring this case under Casey. Therefore, I believe reversal of\nthe district court and judgment for defendants is appropriate, and I dissent from the\ndecision to remand.\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by\nthe courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.R. 36-3\nCCโ | PHONEBOOK.COM\nopen in browser PRO version Are you a developer?
