    "summary": "<p>On August 15, 2012, a mother and her three minor daughters filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 against the Wood County Board of Education and Van Devender Middle School. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. They alleged that the School's single-sex education program approved by the Board violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. </p><p>The three daughters were students who were subject to a program dividing boys and girls into separate classrooms for certain subjects and educated them with distinct teaching methods. The plaintiffs claimed that their school experiences were adversely affected by the physical differences between the boys' and girls' classrooms and the gender-differentiated teaching techniques. </p><p>On August 20, 2012, the District Court (Judge Joseph R. Goodwin) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. The Court noted that two important issues needed further development in this case, which were the voluntariness of the single-sex classes and the availability of substantially equal coeducational alternatives at the School. </p><p>Judge Goodwin held a preliminary injunction hearing on August 27, 2012, and on August 29, 2012, granted a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs. The injunction banned single-sex classes at the School for the remainder of the 2012-2013 school year and until the school's program met the requirements of the Constitution and Title IX. Particularly, the school was forced to comply with the requirement of complete voluntariness under the Department of Education regulations. 888 F. Supp. 2d 771 (S.D.W. Va. 2012). Evidence showed that the students were involuntarily placed in the relevant school program and could only opt out, but the School failed to provide parents and guardians with timely notice and procedural instructions about the opt-out option.  </p><p>On October 15, 2012, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss the case. The Court dismissed all plaintiffs' claims against the individual defendants in light of their entitlement to qualified immunity and the redundancy of the claims. Hence, the Board remained as the only defendant in the case. </p><p>On July 3, 2013, the parties entered a Consent Decree, with defendant denying any liability for sex discrimination in violation of federal law. The Consent Decree prohibited the Defendant from providing any Single-Sex Activity not in accordance with the Court’s interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and Title IX requirements, as presented in the Opinion and Order on August 29, 2012, for the remainder of the 2012-2013 school year, as well as the school years through 2015. If the defendant sought to initiate a Single-Sex Activity not exempted in the Decree at any public school during the school years between 2015 and 2018, the Defendant would be forced to provide the plaintiff with at least 120 days notice prior to initiating the Activity. The plaintiff retained the right to visit the School, so long as she provided 5 days notice, to ensure the school was acting in accordance with federal law and the Consent Decree, for the five year duration the Decree was in effect. The Consent Decree awarded the plaintiff $65,000 in attorneys fees and an undisclosed sum of damages. </p><p>In accordance with the Consent Decree, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the case with prejudice on July 29, 2013. On August 6, 2013, the judge granted the motion, incorporating the consent decree.</p><p>The Court’s jurisdiction over the Consent Decree, as well as the Court’s Permanent Injunction was to terminate on July 4, 2018. The case is presumed closed. </p>",

PATRICK LAW, Superintendent, in his Official  : \nCapacity, STEPHEN TAYLOR, Principal, Van  : \nDevender Middle School, in his Official and Individual  : \nCapacity, and PENNY TONELLI COLEMAN, Former  : \nAssistant Principal of Van Devender Middle School,  : \nin her Individual Capacity,  : \n  : \n  Defendants.  : \n: \n: \n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –– – – – – – – – – – – – –  X   \n \nCOMPLAINT \n1.  This is an action under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal \nProtection Clause (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983), Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 (“Title IX”) and the Title IX implementing regulations of the United States \nDepartments of Education and Agriculture challenging unlawful sex discrimination at the \nVan Devender Middle School (“Van Devender”) in Parkersburg, West Virginia.   \n2.  The Plaintiffs are a mother and her three daughters.  The daughters \nare rising seventh grade students at Van Devender Middle School in Parkersburg, West \nVirginia.  The three minors are acting by and through their mother.  Plaintiffs bring this \n \n \n \n\n \n \naction because the Defendants, from 2010 through 2012, have unlawfully separated girls \nand boys attending Van Devender for reading, math, social studies and science in certain \ngrades.  \n3.  Defendants implemented the sex separation program at Van \nDevender based on impermissible and inaccurate stereotypes about purportedly different \nlearning capacities and preferences of boys and girls, and, specifically, the theory that \nboys’ and girls’ brains develop so differently that they are best taught separately, using \nteaching methods that are tailored to those presumed differences. \n4.  Upon information and belief, Defendants intend to continue to \nseparate students on the basis of sex in core subjects and to expand the scope of the sex \nseparation during the 2012-2013 school year, which begins on August 29, 2012. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343 because this action raises federal questions and seeks to redress the deprivation \nof rights under Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims took place in this \ndistrict and because some of the Defendants reside in this district. \n7.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  A \ndeclaration of the law is necessary and appropriate to determine the parties’ respective \nrights and duties. \n2 \n\n \n \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff JANE DOE is a Resident of Parkersburg, West Virginia.  \nDoe is the mother of five children who have attended, currently attend, or will in the \nfuture attend Van Devender Middle School.  Plaintiff Jane Doe will have at least one \nchild attending Van Devender until 2014.  As a result of the sex separation policies \nimplemented at Van Devender, three of her daughters have already been discriminated \nagainst on the basis of sex and have been denied educational opportunities, in violation of \nthe law.   \n9.  Based on the Wood County School Board’s past actions and its \nmembers’ stated intention to continue sex separation in the future, Jane Doe expects that \nher three daughters who are currently enrolled at Van Devender as well as her youngest \nchild who will attend Van Devender in the future will face discrimination on the basis of \nsex and the denial of educational opportunities, in violation of the law, unless the sex \nseparation policies at Van Devender are permanently enjoined.   \n10.  Jane Doe has no intention of moving to another home outside of \nParkersburg prior to all of her children graduating from Van Devender. \n11.  Plaintiff ANNE DOE is a minor child who attended the sixth grade \nat Van Devender for the 2011-2012 school year.  Because she is a minor, Anne Doe \nappears through her mother Jane Doe.  Plaintiff Anne Doe intends to enter the seventh \ngrade at Van Devender for the 2012-2013 school year, which commences on August 23, \n2012. \n12.  Plaintiff BETH DOE is a minor child who attended the sixth grade \nat Van Devender for the 2011-2012 school year.  Because she is a minor, Beth Doe \nappears through her mother Jane Doe.  Plaintiff Beth Doe intends to enter the seventh \n3 \n\n \n \ngrade at Van Devender for the 2012-2013 school year, which commences on August 23, \n2012. \n13.  Plaintiff CAROL DOE is a minor child who attended the sixth \ngrade at Van Devender for the 2011-2012 school year.  Because she is a minor, Carol \nDoe appears through her mother Jane Doe.  Plaintiff Carol Doe intends to enter the \nseventh grade at Van Devender for the 2012-2013 school year, which commences on \nAugust 23, 2012.     \n14.  Defendant WOOD COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION \n(“WCBE”) is the entity responsible for the administration of public schools within Wood \nCounty, West Virginia, including Van Devender, the school which the WCBE has \ndesignated as the middle school for the Doe family based on the location of their home.  \nAt all relevant times, the WCBE has overseen and approved the implementation of sex \nseparated classes at Van Devender.  The WCBE is a political entity capable of suing and \nbeing sued. \n15.  DEFENDANT J. PATRICK LAW is Superintendent of the Wood \nCounty Schools.  Defendant Law is responsible for administration of all schools within \nthe Wood County School District, including Van Devender.  He is sued in his official \ncapacity.   \n16.  DEFENDANT STEPHEN TAYLOR is the Principal of Van \nDevender.  He reports directly to Superintendent Law.  At all relevant times, Defendant \nTaylor has directly overseen and implemented sex separated classes at Van Devender.  \nHe is sued in his individual and official capacity. \n4 \n\n \n \n17.  DEFENDANT PENNY TONELLI COLEMAN was the Assistant \nPrincipal of Curriculum and Instruction of Van Devender at the time the single-sex \nprogram was conceived and planned.  At the time she was known as Penny Tonelli.  She \nreported directly to Principal Taylor.  She is sued in her individual capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The WCBE’s Approval of Single-Sex Classes at Van Devender \n18.  Van Devender is one of five public middle schools in Parkersburg, \nWest Virginia.  Students attend Van Devender for grades six through eight.  Students are \nassigned to middle schools by WCBE based on the location of their residence.  \n19.  The separation of students on the basis of sex at Van Devender \nMiddle School was first proposed in 2008, when the school received a private grant for \n“Student Educational and Economic Development Success.” \n20.  Defendants Taylor and Tonelli Coleman worked together on \nplanning the single-sex program through the course of the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 \nschool years. \n21.  In January 2009, Defendant Tonelli Coleman invited Leonard Sax, \na private consultant and nationally known proponent of single-sex education, to submit a \nproposal for a two-day workshop for teachers who were or soon would be leading single-\nsex middle school classrooms.   \n22.  Sax is an author and former family physician, and is the founder \nand Executive Director of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education \n(“NASSPE”). \n23.  On March 5, 2009, in response to a phone call from Defendant \nTonelli Coleman, Sax sent an email to Defendant Tonelli Coleman with the subject \n5 \n\n \n \n“checklist for LAUNCHING a gender-separate program” in which he advised that \nTonelli Coleman arrange for a two-day workshop to train teachers and warned that “[i]f \nteachers don’t have this training or comparable training, then the success of your program \nis just a roll of the dice, and you’re building on sand.” \n24.  On June 16, 2009, Sax sent an email to Defendant Tonelli \nColeman regarding upcoming plans for a two-day workshop to be held on August 17 and \n18, including a training session for teachers and a parent information session, and \nattaching a “checklist” for public schools preparing to launch single-sex classrooms. \n25.  On August 17 and 18, 2009, the school held two days of training \nand information sessions for teachers, administrators, and parents with Sax. \n26.  In March 2010, Defendants Tonelli Coleman and Taylor prepared \nto present a proposal to the WCBE seeking approval to institute single-sex classes for all \nincoming sixth graders at Van Devender Middle School for reading, math, social studies \nand science starting at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year.  \n27.  The WCBE formally approved the proposal at its regularly \nscheduled meeting on or around March 9, 2010.  \n28.  The program was initiated at the start of the 2010-2011 school year \nfor all incoming sixth graders for reading, math, social studies and science. \nB.  The Lack of an Adequate Justification for the Single-Sex Education Program \nat Van Devender \n29.  The stated justification for the single-sex education program at \nVan Devender, as presented to the WCBE, was that students of both sexes were lagging \nbehind their peers in Wood County based on the percentage of boys and girls testing as \n6 \n\n \n \n“proficient” on the state standardized WESTEST assessment exam.  The program’s stated \n“mission” was to “deliver a learning experience based on gender diversity.”   \n30.  The sex separation at Van Devender was explicitly premised on \ngeneralizations about the supposedly different brains and learning styles of boys and girls.  \n31.  In the March 2010 presentation to the WCBE seeking approval for \nthe single-sex program in the sixth grade for the 2010-2011 school year, Van Devender \nofficials presented PowerPoint slides including claims that “[r]esearchers at the National \nInstitute of Mental Health found that the various regions of the brain develop in a \ndifferent sequence and tempo in girls compared with boys” and that “[t]he areas of the \nbrain involved in language, spatial memory, motor coordination, and in getting along \nwith other people, develop in a different time, order, and rate in girls compared with \nboys.” \n32.  Defendants Tonelli Coleman and Taylor presented information to \nthe WCBE stating that boys’ and girls’ brains were “hard-wired” to learn and develop \ndifferently, and that different teaching strategies worked better for boys than for girls, and \nvice versa.  \n33.  The WCBE was informed that Van Devender teachers and \nadministrators intended to tailor the teaching methods used in the boys’ and girls’ classes \nto these purportedly different learning capacities through the use of gender-differentiated \ninstructional techniques.    \n34.  Professional development for teachers on gender-differentiated \ninstruction was a central feature of the “Business Plan” Defendants Tonelli Coleman and \n7 \n\n \n \nTaylor presented to the WCBE on the proposed roll-out of the single-sex education \nprogram at Van Devender. \n35.  Defendants Tonelli Coleman and Taylor did not present, and the \nWCBE did not consider, any valid evidence demonstrating a relationship between the \ngoal of raising student achievement and the proposed separation of students on the basis \nof sex at Van Devender. \n36.  In instituting the single-sex classes at Van Devender, Defendants \nTonelli Coleman and Taylor and the WCBE relied on faulty research, including \nnumerous articles espousing the view that hard-wired differences between boys and girls \nnecessitate the use of different teaching methods in single-sex classrooms. \n37.  These materials included the writings of Leonard Sax, numerous \narticles printed on the NASSPE website, and materials generated by David Chadwell, a \nmember of the NASSPE Advisory Board.  Both Sax and Chadwell offer their services for \na fee to consult with school districts regarding single-sex education.  \n38.  For example, in one article from the NASSPE website on which \nDefendants relied, Sax claims that: \n  “Sex differences in learning may derive in part from basic \nphysiological differences, such as differences in the ability to hear, \nand also from differences in higher-level cortical functions.”   \n  These differences have “major implications for best practices for \nteaching girls vs. teaching boys.”  For example, “you want to \nencourage the girls, build them up, while you give the boys a reality \ncheck: make them realize they’re not as brilliant as they think they \nare, and challenge them to do better.” \n  “A girl-friendly classroom is a safe, comfortable, welcoming place.  \nForget hard plastic chairs: put in a sofa and some comfortable bean \nbags.  Let the girls address their teacher by her (or his) first name.”  \n  Use story problems and concrete object examples, like pine cones, \nfor girls, but not boys when teaching Mathematics. “’Story problems’ \n8 \n\n \n \nare a complete flop with boys,” and “if you bring in pinecones for \nthe boys, many of the boys will snicker and start throwing the \npinecones around like hand grenades.” \n  “‘Gross,’ slimy, dangerous or poisonous things are also a hit with \nmost boys, especially younger boys.  Girls, on the other hand, \nusually prefer books which focus on dyadic or triadic \nrelationships. . . .  ‘Girls like stories about experiences that might \nhappen over one summer and the emotional agonies that a character \nendures.  Boys want stories with male protagonists that are \nexciting.’” \n  Consider role-playing for girls (e.g. acting out “Are You There, God?  \nIt’s Me Margaret”) and “objective and fact-oriented” assignments \nfor boys. \n39.  In another published article that was relied upon in the \ndevelopment and implementation of sex separation at Van Devender, Sax claims that: \nFor  the single -sex  format  to lead to im provements  in academ ic \nperformance, teachers must understand the hard -wired differences in how \ngirls  and  boys  learn. In particular ,  teachers need to   understand  the \nimportance of differences in how girls and boys hear, see, and respond to \ndifferent  learning styles, as well  as  the differences in autonom ic \nfunction….  \n \nLeonard Sax, Six Degrees of Separation: What Teachers Need to Know about the \nEmerging Science of Sex Differences, Educational Horizons, Spring 2006, at 190, 195. \nIn this article, Sax recommends that “ambient room temperature” should be six degrees \ncolder in boys’ classrooms, and that teachers in boys’ classrooms should “speak loudly \nand in short, direct sentences with clear instructions:  ‘Put down your papers.  Open your \nbooks.  Let’s get to work!  Mr. Jefferson, that includes you,’” while in the girls’ \nclassrooms, they should “speak much more softly, using more first names with more \nterms of endearment and fewer direct commands:  ‘Lisa, sweetie, it’s time to open your \nbook. Emily, darling, would you please sit down for me and join this exercise?’”  \n40.  These claims are consistent with those Sax makes in his book, Why \nGender Matters:  What Parents and Teachers Need to Know About the Emerging Science \n9 \n\n \n \nof Sex Differences (2005), which is referenced in the school’s presentations and on which \nDefendants relied in the formation and execution of the program.   \n41.  In Why Gender Matters, Sax asserts, for example, that because of \ndifferences in the ways boys and girls process emotion, teachers of literature should not \nask boys about characters’ emotions, but should only focus on objective facts in the text, \nwhile they should focus on characters’ relationships and emotions when teaching girls; \nand that boys do well under stress and girls do badly, so girls should not be given time \nlimits on tests; and that boys are engaged by abstract mathematics while girls need to be \ngiven tactile objects or word problems.   \n42.  Defendants fully embraced the theory of gender-differentiated \nteaching set forth in paragraphs 37 – 41, and made it central to their proposals, \npromotional materials, and communications with parents and the public.  \n43.  The single-sex education program is referred to as “gender-based,” \nand the motto of the school, reflected in presentations to the public and to various \noversight bodies was “Van Devender Middle School:  Where Gender Matters.”   \nC.  Teacher Training on Gender-Differentiated Teaching Methods at Van \nDevender \n44.  In preparation for the proposal and launch of the program, from \n2009 through the initiation of the single-sex classes at Van Devender at the beginning of \nthe 2010-2011 school year, Defendants Tonelli Coleman and Taylor began training \nteachers on gender-differentiated instruction techniques. \n45.  From 2009 through at least 2011, Defendants Tonelli Coleman and \nTaylor arranged for Van Devender teaching staff to attend training sessions conducted by \n10 \n\n \n \nproponents of gender-differentiated teaching, including the national conference of \nNASSPE.   \n46.  At those training sessions, attendees were advised to use “gender \nspecific strategies” in their teaching.   \n47.  For example, one presentation at the 2009 NASSPE conference, \nwhich was attended by Van Devender staff, covered “Essential teaching for Boys” \nadvising teachers to: \n  Use cool colors . . . \n  Go down with your tone \n  Provide movement to keep attention . . . \n  Use surname \n  Be clear and direct with rules and consequences \n  No second chances (do not argue) \n  Do and then talk! \n  In rows or stations \n  Ideal temperature 69°F \n  Whole to parts \n \nThe parallel “Essentials for teaching Girls” advised teachers to:  \n  Use warm colors . . . \n  Interpret loud or deep voices as “yelling” at them \n  Illustrations are colored (do not emphasize color over content) \n  Use surname \n  More time for activities . . . \n  Build Community \n  Bond through face-to-face communication \n  Warmer room \n  Parts to whole \n \n48.  The presentation instructed that boys were to be taught “[i]n pairs \n(side by side)” and girls “[i]n pairs (face-to-face)”; boys were to be allowed to stand \nwhile girls’ movement was to be limited, with “noise distractions [kept] to a minimum.” \n11 \n\n \n \n49.  PowerPoint presentations used at the training contain numerous \ngeneralizations about boys’ and girls’ purportedly different capacities in the areas of \nperception, learning and development.  For example, another presentation at the 2009 \nNASSPE conference, given by Skyles Calhoun, a member of the Advisory Board of \nNASSPE, included slides containing the following claims:  \nThe Brain Develops Differently \nGIRLS—the language areas of the brain develop before the areas used for \nspatial relations and for geometry. \nBOYS—it is the other way around. \nTeaching that ignores this difference will produce boys who can’t write and \ngirls who think they’re “dumb at math”. \n \nThe Brain is Wired Differently \nGIRLS—emotion is processed in the same area of the brain that possesses \nlanguage. So, it’s easier for most girls to talk about their emotions. \nBOYS—The brain regions involved in talking are separate from the regions \ninvolved in feeling. The hardest question for a boy to answer is, “Tell me \nhow you feel.” \n \nGirls Hear Better \nThe typical teenage girl has a sense of hearing seven times more acute than \na teenage boy \nThat’s why daughters complain that their fathers are shouting at them. \nThat’s why the boy in the back of the classroom whose soft-spoken teacher \ncalls on him responds by saying, “Huh?”. \n \nGirls and Boys Respond Differently to Stress \nGIRLS—Stress impairs learning \nBOYS—Stress enhances learning. This is true in every mammal that \nscientists have studied.   \n  \n50.  Training on gender-differentiated instruction continued during the \n2011-2012 school year. \n51.  In January 2011, Defendant Taylor hired David Chadwell to \nconduct classroom visits and a parent workshop, and provide training sessions to teachers \nand administrators at Van Devender. \n12 \n\n \n \n52.  Chadwell held a teacher training and parent workshop on \nJanuary 19 and 20, 2011. \n53.  Chadwell’s training sessions included generalizations about boys’ \nand girls’ purportedly different brains and learning styles. \n54.  For example, a Chadwell presentation provided to Van Devender \nteachers includes the claim that boys and girls “deal with stress differently,” and goes on \nto assert:  “Stress tends to decrease the blood flow to the brain of a girl.  It goes to the \n‘gut.’  Stress tends to increase the blood flow to the brain of a male and helps him remain \nalert and focused.” \n55.  Chadwell’s presentation also contained tips for tailoring \ninstructional techniques to these presumed differences, advising, for example, that \n“Teachers may use rapid-fire questions with the boys.  Teachers will take time to answer \nquestions of the girls and explain directions upfront.  Activities may be broken into timed \nsegments for the boys.  Girls may participate in partner or group reviews and discussion \noften.” \nD.  Assignment of Students to Single-Sex Classes at Van Devender \n56.  Van Devender has assigned all students in the relevant grades to \nsingle-sex classes for reading, math, social studies and science. \n57.  At no time were parents of students assigned to the Van Devender \nsingle-sex classes asked to choose whether or not to enroll their children in a single-sex \nor a coeducational class for each of the core subjects of reading, math, social studies and \nscience. \n13 \n\n \n \n58.  Defendants Tonelli Coleman and Taylor and members of the \nWCBE were aware of the legal requirement that participation in the single-sex classes be \nvoluntary. \n59.  Nonetheless, Defendants did not provide the opportunity to \nparticipate in coeducational classes at Van Devender Middle School as an alternative to \nthe single-sex classes.  \n60.  Van Devender is not a school in which enrollment was optional \nfrom the outset, but, rather, a school to which students are automatically assigned based \non their residence in a particular geographic area.  \nE.  Expansion of the Single-Sex Education Program at Van Devender \n61.  At a WCBE meeting in March 2011, WCBE voted to continue the \nsex separation of the sixth-grade class of Van Devender students as they rose into the \nseventh grade and to continue to mandate it for the incoming sixth-grade class of Van \nDevender students for the 2011-2012 school year.  \nF.  Gender-Differentiated Teaching at Van Devender \n62.  The gender-differentiated teaching techniques on which the single-\nsex program at Van Devender was premised, and on which Van Devender teachers and \nadministrators had been trained, were employed in the boys’ and the girls’ classrooms at \nVan Devender once the program commenced.  \n63.  The boys’ and girls’ classrooms differ in their physical \nconfiguration in numerous ways. \n64.  In the boys’ classrooms, the lights are brighter, the rooms are kept \ncooler, the desks are arranged side-by side, and the boys have bean bag chairs in which \nthey are allowed to sit during classes. \n14 \n\n \n \n65.  The girls’ classrooms are more dimly lit, the rooms are kept \nwarmer, the desks are arranged face-to-face, and the girls do not have bean bag chairs. \n66.  In the boys’ classes, students are allowed to move around during \nclass.  The girls are expected to sit still during class. \n67.  On occasion, teachers have conducted the boys’ classes outdoors \nso the students can be permitted to exercise and blow off steam.  The girls’ classes have \nnot been provided with this opportunity. \n68.  Defendant Taylor described some of the reasoning behind the \ndifferent techniques used for boys and girls in a YouTube video:  \n[A]nyone who’s had children, both a boy  and a girl, know that they’re \ndifferent.  And so what we’ve done is  we’ve done a lot of research in the \ndifferences of how boys’ and girls’ brains are made up, what their interests \nare, what motivates them.  So what  we did was, we have taken those \nstrategies and we have developed th em into boys’ classes and to girls’ \nclasses.  We know that boys have a much shorter attention span than girls \nhave so we have set the boys’ classrooms up so they can get up and move \naround and lay on the floor if they want, whatever, while girls are m uch \nmore organized; they sit at . . . rou nd tables, facing each other, sharing \nthings, doing that sort of thing.  We know that boys like brighter lights, so \nwe have the boys’ rooms lit a little differently than we do the girls’ rooms.  \nBoys, we sit them side-by-side, because when they look each other in the \neye it becomes more of a confront ational type thing.  Girls, again, sit \naround tables, where they can m ake eye contact, where they can m ake \nrelationships, and that sort of thing. \n \nG.  The Does’ Experience in Single-Sex Classes at Van Devender \n69.  As of the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year, Anne, Beth and \nCarol Doe were assigned to Van Devender based on the location of their residence in \nWood County and automatically enrolled in the incoming sixth-grade class. \n70.  Jane Doe never received any notification informing her of the \nopportunity for her children to participate in any coeducational classes at Van Devender \nfor the 2011-2012 school year.   \n15 \n\n \n \n71.  Jane Doe never received any notification that her daughters would \nbe placed in single-sex classes in the sixth grade at Van Devender prior to the \ncommencement of the 2011-2012 school year. \n72.  Jane Doe believes that sending her children to a different school at \nthis point in time would be academically and psychologically detrimental.  Jane Doe and \nher children moved to a new home with a new school during the summer when the girls \nwere between third and fourth grade, which was hard on them.  Furthermore, Anne and \nCarol are involved in many extracurricular activities and, upon information and belief, \nPlaintiff’s daughters would be ineligible to participate in athletic activities for one year \nafter transferring to another school. \n73.  Beth Doe has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder and sometimes has trouble sitting still in class.  She is not permitted to move \naround freely during classes in the girls’ classrooms to which she is assigned, and as a \nresult, she is frequently reprimanded in class.  Upon information and belief, similar \nmovement in the boys’ classroom is tolerated and not reprimanded.  \n74.  On numerous occasions, Beth has been sent to the boys’ classroom \nbecause she was “acting up.”  As the only girl in the class, and deprived of the \ncompanionship of her regular classmates, she felt intimidated.  She experienced this as a \nform of punishment, and upon information and belief, it was intended as a punishment.  \nWhen Beth was sent to the boys’ classroom, she missed out on the lessons being \nconducted in the girls’ classroom, and she was not allowed to participate in the physical \nlearning activities that were part of the boys’ curriculum; instead, she was required to sit \n16 \n\n \n \nat a desk facing the wall.  Beth’s grades have dropped substantially since she entered \ngender-based classes. \n75.  Beth Doe has experienced difficulty learning in the girls’ classes, \nas she learns best through the type of visual and physical learning activities she witnessed \nin the boys’ classes. \n76.  Anne Doe is legally blind and has difficulty reading in the girls’ \nclassroom, which is kept dimmer than the boys’ classroom.  Anne would benefit from \nbrighter lights to enable her to read more easily during class, but she has not been \npermitted that option.  When Anne asked her teachers to brighten the lights to \naccommodate her vision problems, her teachers refused and told her to move closer to the \nwindow.   \n77.  Carol Doe also has poor eyesight and requires strong contact lenses \nand prescription glasses.  Carol has difficulty reading her assignments in the all girls’ \nclasses at Van Devender Middle School, because she cannot see well in the dimly lit girls’ \nclassrooms.  When she has requested brighter lighting in the classroom, teachers \ninstructed her to sit near the window.  After spending a year in the dimmer girls’ \nclassrooms, Carol required stronger prescriptions for glasses and contact lenses.  Carol \nfeels uncomfortable and experiences headaches in her classrooms because her teachers \nmaintain a warm temperature and dim lights in the girls’ classrooms as part of the \ngender-based program.   \n78.  Carol Doe learns and retains information most effectively when \nshe takes notes during teachers’ visual presentations.  When Carol requested more time to \ntake notes on individual slides during her teachers’ PowerPoint presentations, her \n17 \n\n \n \nrequests were denied based on the theory that girls learn better from auditory rather than \nvisual input.   \n79.  In addition, Anne often studies by reading and repeating her work \nout loud.  This can be disruptive to other students because the desks in the girls’ \nclassrooms are positioned face-to-face, and Anne’s voice sometimes disturbs the student \nat the desk opposite her.  In some of her classes, when Anne has asked to study in a \ndifferent part of the classroom so she would not disturb her classmates, the teacher has \ndenied her request and forced her to continue sitting in the face-to-face configuration, \nwhich has hampered her ability to study and learn.  Upon information and belief, in the \nboys’ classroom a similarly situated student would be seated beside, not facing, other \nstudents and would be allowed to move away and sit on a beanbag or elsewhere in the \nclassroom to work.  Anne has received lower grades in English this year because she has \nnot been able to study in the way that teachers in mixed gender classrooms had \npreviously accommodated. \nH.  The Harms of Sex Separated Classes  \n80.  Not all girls are alike.  Research demonstrates that the \npsychological and learning differences between individual girls are far larger than the \naverage psychological or learning differences between girls and boys. \n81.  Not all boys are alike.  Research demonstrates that the \npsychological and learning differences between individual boys are far larger than the \naverage psychological or learning differences between boys and girls. \n82.  Sex is an imprecise proxy for psychological, learning, emotional \nand developmental differences in adolescents.  Psychological research demonstrates that, \non average, boys and girls are psychologically more alike than different.  \n18 \n\n \n \n83.  Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer concrete and \nirreparable injury as a result of Defendants’ illegal conduct.   \n84.  For example, Plaintiffs are subjected to increased sex role \nstereotyping, which psychological research demonstrates results in anxiety that impairs \nfunctioning on tests.   \n85.  Sex separation and gender-differentiated teaching methods like \nthose employed at Van Devender also harm children who do not conform to the gender \nstereotypes advanced in these classes, such as boys who would happily engage in a \nconversation about literary characters’ emotions or girls who need to move around. \nSeparation and different teaching methods tells these children that they are not “normal.”  \n86.  Monetary damages cannot remedy the irreparable injury suffered \nby Plaintiffs.   \n87.  The Defendants’ discriminatory policies and practices threaten \nharm to the dignity interests of Plaintiffs. \n88.  The Defendants’ discriminatory policies and practices have \ndeprived and continue to threaten to deprive Plaintiffs of unique educational \nopportunities – including the benefits of a fully coeducational school, and of a school free \nfrom stereotypes about the way boys and girls learn and behave.  The girls have been \ndenied opportunities available only to the boys.  For example, the girls are obligated to sit \nstill in class while the boys are not and the girls are punished by reprimand or temporary \nexpulsion from the classroom for behaving in a manner for which the boys are not \npunished. \n19 \n\n \n \n89.  These policies and practices have also deprived and threaten to \ncontinue to deprive Plaintiffs of the unique educational experiences and opportunities \nafforded in the single-sex classes from which they are excluded on the basis of their sex. \nI.  Continued Expansion of the Single-Sex Education Program at Van Devender \nin 2012-2013 \n90.  On December 2, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of West \nVirginia sent a request under the West Virginia Freedom of Information Law seeking \ndocuments and records related to the single-sex education program operated at Van \nDevender Middle School. \n91.  On May 21, 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union of West \nVirginia sent a letter to the WCBE identifying legal violations relating to the single-sex \neducation program at Van Devender Middle School and requesting that the program be \nterminated as of the start of the 2012-2013 school year.   \n92.  At a school board meeting on July 2, 2012, the WCBE voted to \ncontinue the single-sex education program in the sixth and seventh grades, and to expand \nit into the eighth grade, for the 2012-2013 school year.    \nJ.  Federal Funding  \n93.  Wood County Schools, including Van Devender, receive federal \nfunding and are subject to the requirements of Title IX.   \n94.  The federal funding received by the WCBE consists of funding \nfrom the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture. \n95.  The WCBE and all of its operations, including Van Devender are, \ntherefore, subject to the Title IX regulations promulgated by the U.S. Departments of \n20 \n\n \n \nEducation and Agriculture.  Upon information and belief, the WCBE has specifically \nagreed to comply with those regulations.  \nK.  Defendants’ Conduct   \n96.  Defendants have acted and engaged in conduct as set forth in \nparagraphs 1 through 95 above intentionally, willfully, and in disregard of the rights of \nPlaintiffs.   \n97.  Defendants have acted and engaged in conduct as set forth in \nparagraphs 1 through 95 above with actual notice of and deliberate indifference to the \nrights of Plaintiffs.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:  Equal Protection \n(against WCBE and Defendant Law in his Official Capacity, \nDefendant Taylor in his Individual and Official Capacity, and \nDefendant Tonelli Coleman in her Individual Capacity) \n98.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1 through 97 above. \n99.  By separating classes at Van Devender by sex, Defendants have \nintentionally classified students by sex and discriminated amongst them on the basis of \nsex in violation of Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection of the laws, secured (pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983) by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:  Title IX, against WCBE \n100.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1 through 97 above. \n21 \n\n \n \n101.  By instituting sex separated classes at Van Devender, Defendant \nWCBE (i) has excluded Plaintiffs from educational programs and activities on the basis \nof their sex, (ii) has denied Plaintiffs the benefits of educational programs and activities \non the basis of their sex; and (iii) has subjected Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of \ntheir sex, in violation of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n102.  By providing classes separately at Van Devender on the basis of \nsex, requiring or refusing student participation in classes on the basis of the students’ sex, \nand subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of their sex, Defendant WCBE has \nviolated Title IX as interpreted by the implementing regulations of the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, 7 C.F.R. §§ 15a.31, 15a.34.   \n103.  By providing different educational aid, benefits or services on the \nbasis of sex, and/or providing aid, benefits or services in a different manner on the basis \nof sex, Defendant WCBE has violated Title IX as interpreted by the implementing \nregulations of the U.S. Department of Education in 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(2). \n104.  By denying educational aid, benefits or services on the basis of sex, \nDefendant WCBE has violated Title IX as interpreted by the U.S. Department of \nEducation in 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b)(3). \n105.  By providing classes separately at Van Devender on the basis of \nsex, requiring or refusing student participation in classes on the basis of the students’ sex, \nand subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of their sex, Defendant WCBE has \nviolated Title IX as interpreted by the Department of Education in 34 C.F.R. § 106.34 \n(1)   By failing to ensure that enrollment in any sex separated course at \nVan Devender is substantially related to either of two objectives specified \n22 \n\n \n \nby the U.S. Department of Education’s regulations, Defendant WCBE has \nviolated the requirements of 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(i). \n(2)    By failing to ensure that enrollment in any sex separated course at \nVan Devender is completely voluntary, Defendant WCBE has violated 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(iii).   \n(3)    By failing to provide all students, including students of the \nexcluded sex, substantially equal coeducational classes in the same \nsubjects as the sex separated classes, Defendant WCBE has violated 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(iv). \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n(1)  Permanently enjoin Defendants from separating any class or \neducational program by sex; \n(2)  Permanently enjoin all Defendants, their agents and employees, \nand all persons acting in concert or participation with them, including any \nsuccessors and assigns, to take all affirmative steps necessary to remedy \nthe effects of the illegal, discriminatory conduct described in this \ncomplaint and to prevent similar future occurrences; \n(3)  Declare that the actions of Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder \n(i)  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution; and \n(ii)  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; \n23 \n\n \n \n(4)  Award Plaintiffs monetary and nominal damages to fairly and \nreasonably compensate Plaintiffs for any deprivation of their rights; \n(5)  Award Plaintiffs their expenses, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ \nfees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and any other applicable provision of law; \nand \n(6)  Award other equitable and monetary relief as the Court deems just \nand proper. \nDated:  August 15, 2012  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \n   \n  /s/             \nSarah Rogers (pro hac vice pending)  Roger D.

CIVIL  ACTION NO.  6:12-cv-04355 \n \nWOOD COUNTY BOARD OF \nEDUCATION, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n  Pending before the court is the Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss [Docket 52]. A response \nand reply have been filed, and the motion is ripe for review. For the reasons set forth below, the \ncourt GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The motion is \nGRANTED  as to the claim s  against defendants Ta ylor  and Colem an  in their individual \ncapacities and defendants Law and Taylor  in their official capacities, and  DENIED as to the  \nremaining claims. Accordingly, the court  ORDERS that the claims against defendants Taylor \nand Coleman in their individual  capacities and defendants Law a nd Taylor in their official \ncapacities be DISMISSED. \nI.  Background and Procedural History \n \nThis  case arises from   the single-sex cl assroom  program  adopted  by Van Devender \nMiddle School (“VDMS”) in a commendable attem pt to improve the education of its students. \nThe plaintiffs are a mother, Jane Doe, and her three daughters, Anne Doe, Beth Doe, and Carol \n1 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 1079\nDoe.1 The daughters all attended the sixth grade  at VDMS for the 2011-12 school year, and are \ncurrently attending the seventh grade for th e 2012-13 school year.  Defendant Wood County \nBoard of Education (“WCBE”) is the entity responsible for the administration of public schools \nwithin Wood County, West Virginia, includi ng VDMS, and has overseen and approved the  \nimplementation  of sex-separated classes at   VDMS. Def endant  J.  Patrick  Law  is th e \nsuperintendent of the Wood County Schools, and  is responsible for the adm inistration of all \nschools within the Wood County School District, including VDMS. Defendants Stephen Taylor \nand Penny Coleman are the Principal and Vice Principal, respectively, of VDMS, and have both \noverseen and implemented the sex-separated classes at VDMS. \nVDMS is one of five public middle schools in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Students from \ngrades six through eight are assigned to middle schools by WCBE based on the location of their \nresidence.  In 2010, the WCBE  approved  the single-sex educa tion  program  at VDMS. The \nprogram was adopted for sixth grade classes in the 2010-11 school year, expanded to the seventh \ngrade in 2011-12, and expanded to the eighth  grade for the 2012-13 school year. Classes for  \nreading, math, social studies, and science are separated by gender, while classes in other subjects \nare coeducational.  \nOn August 15, 2012, the plaintiffs filed the in stant lawsuit alleging  that the single-sex \nclasses at VDMS violated the E qual Protection Clause of the F ourteenth Amendment and Title \nIX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, as interpreted by the Depa rtment of Agriculture and Departm ent of \nEducation in their respective regulations, 7 C.F.R. § 15a.34 and 34 C.F.R. § 106.34. On the same \nday, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. \nThe  court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a  temporary  restraining order, but granted the  \n                                                 \n1   The plaintiffs are proceeding under pseudonym. \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 1080\nplaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction in its Memorandum Opinion and Order on August \n29, 2012 [Docket 51]. \nThe defendants subsequently filed the instan t motion to dismiss, arguing that (1) the \nplaintiffs’ § 1983 action should be dism issed in light of the court’s  Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder;  (2) the plaintiffs’ §  1983  claims  against defendants  Taylor  and Coleman in their \nindividual capacities should be dismissed because these defendants are entitled to qualified  \nimmunity; (3) the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim s against defendants Law and Taylor in their official \ncapacities should be dismissed because they are redundant to the claim against the WCBE; and \n(4) the plaintiffs’ claims for dam ages against the individual defendants should be dism issed \npursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. \nII.  Legal Standard for Motions to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \n \nA motion to dismiss filed under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint or \npleading. Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir. 2008). Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 8 requires that a pleading contain a  Ashort and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief. @ FED. R. CIV. P. 8. As the Suprem e Court reiterated in \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, that standard  Adoes not require  >detailed factual allegations= but >it demands \nmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.=@ 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 ( 2007)). A[A] plaintiff=s \nobligation to provide the  >grounds= of his >entitle[ment] to relief= requires more than labels and \nconclusions,  and a formulaic recitation of the  elements  of a cause o f  action will not do. @ \nTwombly,  550 U.S. at   555 (citin g  Papasan  v. Allain ,  478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986) for the \nproposition  that  Aon  a motion to dism iss,  courts  >are  not  bound to   accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation=@). A court cannot accept as true legal conclusions in a \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 1081\ncomplaint  that m erely  recite the elem ents  of a cause of action supported by conclusory \nstatements. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 677-78. ATo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to >state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.=@ \nId. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). To achieve facial  plausibility, the plaintiff must \nplead facts that allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable, and \nthose facts must be more than merely consistent with the defendant=s liability to raise the claim \nfrom merely possible to probable. Id. \nIn determining whether a plausible claim  exists, the court m ust undertake a context-\nspecific inquiry, A[b]ut where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to inf er more than \nthe mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not >show[n]=—>that the \npleader is entitled to re lief.=@ Id. at 679 (quoting F ED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2)). A complain t must \ncontain  enough facts to  Anudge[]  [a] claim   cross  the line fr om  conceivable to plausible. @  \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570. \nIII.  The Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss th e Plaintiffs’ § 1983 Claim in Light of the \nCourt’s Memorandum Opinion and Order \n \n  The defendants argue that the court shoul d dismiss the plaintiffs’ § 1983 action. The  \ndefendants contend that “Plaintiffs’ sole allegation with respect to the basis for their First Cause \nof Action is that the classifica tion of students by sex is uncons titutional.” (Mem. in Supp. of \nDefs.’ Mot. to Dismiss [Docket 53], at 6). Ther efore, according to the defendants, because the \ncourt ruled that the separation of students by sex does not violate the Constitution per se, the \nplaintiffs’ § 1983 claim necessarily fails. (See id. at 5-6). \n  The plaintiffs respond by arguing that their  Equal Protection claim was properly pleaded \nby alleging discriminatory treatment, and by alleging “not merely that Defendants violated the \nPlaintiffs’ rights to equal protection ‘by separating the classes at Van Devender by sex,’ but also \n4 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 1082\nthat they failed to comply with constitutional standards in doing so.” (Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. \nto Dismiss [Docket 58], at 2). \n  To state a claim under § 1983, “a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States,  and must show that the alleged deprivation was \ncommitted by a person acting under color of state law.”  West v. Adkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988); \nsee also Crosby v. City of Gastonia, 635 F.3d 634, 639 (4th Cir. 2011). To allege a “prim a facie \nequal protection violation, it is enough that a pl aintiff complains of governm ental treatment \ndissimilar to that received by others similarly situated.” Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 \nF.2d 943, 953 (4th Cir. 1992). Once the plaintiff ha s sufficiently alleged this violation, the \nburden then shifts to the defendants to show th at the classification does not violate the Equal \nProtection  Clause.  United  States v. Virginia ,  518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). For gender-based \nclassifications, “the burden of justification is  demanding and it rests en tirely on the State.” \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; see also Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan , 458 \nU.S. 718, 724 (1982). \n  The defendants’ argument fails because it confuses the extent of the court’s ruling. To put \nthe ruling in context, at the hearings for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, \nthe plaintiffs had, at one point,  taken the position that single-sex  classes could never withstand \nscrutiny under the Constitution and Title IX. The  court simply rejected this position and ruled \nthat single-sex classes are not unconstitutional per se, because it is entire ly possible for such \nclasses to be constitutional if the school meets the heightened scrutiny set forth in United States \nv. Virginia. (Mem. Op. & Order [Docket 51], at 10). However, the plaintiffs’ complaint alleges: \n99.  By  separating classes at Van  Devender  by sex, D efendants  have \nintentionally classified students by se x and discriminated amongst them on the  \nbasis of sex in violation of Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection of the laws, secured \n5 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 1083\n(pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983) by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n \n(Compl. ¶ 99). In several earlier  paragraphs of the complaint, incorporated by reference in the \nplaintiffs’ First Cause of Action, the plaintiffs  allege that VDMS assi gned students in certain \ngrades to single-sex classes in certain subjects. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 2, 56).2 To survive a motion \nto  dismiss  on the  equal  protection  claim,  the  plaintiffs’  burden is to   show a gender-based \nclassification by the defendants, and the plain tiffs have done so here . Paragraph 99 of the \ncomplaint,  combined  with the ea rlier  incorporated  paragraphs, sufficiently alleges an equal \nprotection violation to survive the  motion to dismiss. Accordingly, I  DENY the defendants’ \nMotion  to Dism iss  the § 1983 claim   under Rule  12(b)(6).  The burden now shifts to the \ndefendants to show an “exceeding ly persuasive justification” for the single-sex classes because \nthese classes are separated by gender. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533;  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724. \nThus, the defendants now carry the burden of show ing “at least th at the classification serves \nimportant governmental objectives” and that it is “subs tantially related to the achievement of \nthose objectives.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724.  \nIV.  The  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss  the  Plaintiffs’  § 1983 Claim Against the  \nIndividual Defendants \n \n  With respect to the individual defendants, the defendants first  argue that defendants \nTaylor and Coleman are entitled to qualified immun ity with respect to the plain tiffs’ claims \nagainst them in their individual capacities. Th e defendants then argue that the p laintiffs’ claims \nagainst defendants Law and Taylor in their offi cial capacities should be dism issed, as these \n                                                 \n2   I note that th e plaintiffs have further alleged that this gender cl assification does not  meet the \nheightened scrutiny in United States v. Virginia. The complaint extensively alleges, for example, that the \nsingle-sex classes were based on the exact type of stereotypes ruled im permissible by the United States \nSupreme Court. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 2, 30-32, 36, 38). \n6 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 1084\nclaims are redundant because the W CBE is also a defendant to the lawsuit. I address these two \narguments in turn below. \n  A.  Defendants Taylor and Coleman are Entitled to Qualified Immunity \n \n  The  defendants assert that defendants Ta ylor  and Colem an  are entitled to qu alified \nimmunity.  The defense of qualified imm unity  “shields  government  officials perform ing \ndiscretionary functions from personal-capacity liability for civil dam ages under § 1983, insofar  \nas their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a \nreasonable person would have known.”  Brockington v. Boykins, 637 F.3d 503, 506 (4th Cir. \n2011) (quoting Ridpath v. Bd. of Governors Marshall Univ., 447 F.3d 292, 306 (4th Cir. 2006)); \nsee also Pearson v. Callahan , 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009). Governm ent officials are entitled to \nqualified immunity “unless the § 1983 claim satisfies a two-prong test: (1) the allegations, if true, \nsubstantiate a violation of a federal statutory or constitutional right and (2) the right was clearly \nestablished such that a reasonable person would have known his acts or omissions violated that \nright.” Brockington, 637 F.3d at 506 (internal qu otation marks omitted). The court may address \nthese two elements in any order,  and will first assess whether the rights at issue were clearly \nestablished. See Merchant v. Bauer, 677 F.3d 656, 661 (4th Cir. 2012). \nA constitutional right is “clearly established when its contours are sufficiently clear that a \nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.” Ridpath, 447 F.3d \nat 313 (quoting  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002)). W hile the unlawfulness m ust be \napparent in light of pre-existing law, “the very action in question need not have previously been \nheld unlawful.” Ridpath, 447 F.3d at 313 (in ternal quotations omitted). “[O]fficials can still be \non notice that their conduct violates establishe d law even in novel factual circum stances. The \nsalient question is whether the state  of the law at  the time of the events in questio n gave the \n7 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 1085\nofficials  fair warning that their conduct was unconstitutional.”  Id.  (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted).  \n  The defendants focus solely on their argum ent that the right was not clearly established. \nThe defendants discuss Doe ex rel. Doe v. Vermillion Parish Sch. Bd., 421 F. App’x 366 (5th \nCir. 2011) and  A.N.A. ex rel. S.F.A. v. Breckinr idge Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 833 F. Supp. 2d 673 \n(W.D. Ky. 2011), the only two published legal opin ions directly discussing single-sex education \nprior to the instant action, and as sert that neither case clearly es tablishes that the defendants’ \nalleged acts would be unconstitutional or contrary  to federal statute. T he plaintiffs respond by \nasserting that United States v. Virginia and Hogan clearly established rights that a reason able \neducator in defendants Taylor and Coleman’s position would have been aware of.  \n  The court has reviewed the applicable legal authorities, and recognizes that this is a close \nquestion.  It seem s  that the defend ants  failed to recognize that  United  States v. Virginia  \nestablishes standards as to the issu e of gender classifi cations generally.3 However, the Fourth \nCircuit has instructed courts to identify the specific right that the plaintiffs assert at a high level \nof particularity, in the context of the specific facts of the case. See Merchant, 677 F.3d at 665; \nSwanson v. Powers, 937 F.2d 965, 969 (4th Cir. 1991). Assessing the right at the proper level of \nparticularity, it is clear that no prior case law ha s directly addressed many of the specific issues \nprevalent in this case, involving  a school’s implementation of single-sex classes pursuant to the \nDepartment of Education regulations, 34 C.F. R. § 106.34(b), which “provide som e foundation \nfor a public school’s attempt to experiment with single-sex education.” Vermillion, 421 F. App’x \nat  369. W hile  United  States v. V irginia  and  Hogan  addressed the standards that gender \n                                                 \n3   Indeed, the defendants argue merely that the plaintiffs’ “reliance on Hogan and Virginia, with \nrespect to any Qualified Immunity argument, is perplexing” because “neither case addresses efforts by a \nSchool Board to implement Single Sex Education Classes pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 106.3 4(b).” (Defs.’ \nReply to Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss [Docket 61], at 6). \n8 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 1086\nclassifications must meet, these cases do not put a reasonable educator in defendants Taylor and \nColeman’s positions on notice as to whether the specific single-sex classroom program adopted \nat VDMS would violate those standards.4 Similarly, while the Department of Education provided \nsimilar standards in its regulations, neither these standards nor any case law since the adoption of \nthese regulations provide defendants in Taylor and Coleman’s positions on notice as to whether \nthe single-sex classes at VDMS would violate the standards.5 \nIn addition, while Vermillion and Breckinridge dealt directly with single-sex classrooms \nat schools, neither case would put the defendants  on notice that the single-sex classes at VDMS \nwould violate the plaintiffs’ rights.  Vermillion and Breckinridge both largely passed on the \nConstitutional question. Neither case addressed the issues in the instant case on their substantive \nmerits.  “When determ ining  whether a reasona ble  officer would have been aware of a  \nconstitutional right, we do not impose on the official a duty to sort out conflicting decisions or to \nresolve subtle or open issues.”  Campbell v. Galloway, 483 F.3d 258, 271 (4th Cir. 2007). \nMoreover, “[i]n determining whether a right was clearly established at the time of the claimed \nviolation, ‘courts in this circuit [ordinarily] need not look be yond the decisions of the Suprem e \nCourt, this court of appeals, and the highest court of the state in which the case arose.’” Edwards \nv. City of Goldsboro , 178 F.3d 231, 251 (4th Cir. 1999). Given the lack of cases on point, \naddressing the specific issues presented in the in stant case, I cannot conclude that the law was  \n                                                 \n4   United States v. Virginia did not involve single-sex classrooms; instead, it involved the exclusion \nof women from the  Virginia Military Institute (“VMI”). Virginia established a separate program  for \nwomen,  which the Supre me  Court co mpared  with  VMI and found significant differences which  \n“afford[ed] women no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which VMI is famed.” \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 548. \n5   The commentary regarding the regulations discu sses at length, and cites, the  Supreme Court’s \nholdings in United States v. Virginia. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs \nor Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assist ance, 71 Fed. Reg. 62530, 62533.  The language in the \nregulations ultimately adopted closely tracks the standards set forth in United States v. Virginia. Compare \n34 C.F.R. §§ 106.34(b)(1)(i) & (4)(i) with Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. \n9 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 1087\n“clearly established” such that defendants Tayl or and Coleman had sufficient notice that the \nsingle-sex classroom program at VDMS would violate the Equal Protection Clause or Title IX. \nAccordingly, defendants Taylor and Coleman are entitled to qualified immunity, and the \nmotion to dismiss on this ground is GRANTED. \nB.  The Claims Against Defendants Law and Taylor in their Official Capacities \nare Redundant \n \n  The defendants maintain that the plaintiffs’ claims against defendants Law and Taylor in \ntheir official capacities are re dundant to the plaintiffs’ claim s against the WCBE, and should \ntherefore be dismissed. The plaintiffs admit that “[b]oth the Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit \nhave held that official capacity claims are essentially redundant of claims against a governmental \nentity,” but argue th at dismissal is not  required and asks the cour t to allow these claims to \nproceed. (Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dism iss [Docket 58], at 14). Indeed, the United States \nSupreme Court has explained that: \nOfficial-capacity suits . . . gen erally represent only another  way of pleading an \naction against an entity of which an officer is an agent. As long as the government \nentity receives notice and an opportunity to respond, an official-capacity suit is, in \nall respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.  \n \nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985)  (internal citations omitted). And the Fourth \nCircuit has held that a § 1983 cla im against a school-board official  “in his official capacity as \nSuperintendent  is essentially a claim   against  the Board and thus s hould  be dism issed  as \nduplicative.” Love-Lane v. Martin, 355 F.3d 766, 783 (4th Cir. 2004);  see also Cline v. Auville, \nNo. 1:09-0301, 2010 WL 1380140, at *4 (S .D. W. Va. Mar. 30, 2010);  Lee v. City of South \nCharleston, No. 2:08-0289, 2009 WL 2602378, at *10 (S.D . W. Va. Aug. 21, 2009). W hile the \ncourt may not be  required to dismiss the claims agains t defendants Law and Taylor in their \nofficial capacities, the court nonetheless does so  because it FINDS that there is little benef it in \n10 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 11 of 12 PageID #: 1088\nretaining these officials as named defendants. See Chase v. City of Portsmouth, 428 F. Supp. 2d \n487, 488-89 (E.D. Va. 2006).  \nAccordingly, I GRANT defendants Law and Ta ylor’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ \nclaims against them in their official capacities. \nV.  The Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss any Claims for Damages against the Individual \nDefendants Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment \n \n  The defendants argue that, to any extent th at the plaintiffs brin g a claim for damages \nagainst the individual defenda nts Law, Taylor, and Colem an, the claim should be dism issed \nunder  the Eleventh A mendment.  The plaintiffs   respond by asserting that the Eleventh \nAmendment does not extend to counties and sim ilar municipal corporations, including county \nschool boards such as the WCBE. (Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss [Docket 58], at 16-19). \nAs discussed above, I granted th e motion to dismiss the claims against defendants Taylor and \nColeman in their individual capacities and the claims against defendants Taylor and Law in their \nofficial capacities. Since the only rem aining defendant is the WCBE, the Eleventh Amendment \nissue regarding the individual defendants is moot and I do not reach this question. \nVI.  Conclusion \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, the court  GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Docket 52]. The motion is GRANTED as to the claims against \ndefendants Taylor and Coleman in their individual capacities and defendants Law and Taylor in \ntheir  official capacities,   and  DENIED  as to the rem aining  claims.  Accordingly,  the court \nORDERS that the claims against defendants Taylor and Coleman in their individual capacities \nand defendants Law and Taylor in their official capacities be DISMISSED. \nThe court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any \nunrepresented party.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 66   Filed 10/15/12   Page 12 of 12 PageID #: 1089\nENTER:  October 15, 2012 \n12 ",

      "text": "  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA \n   \n  PARKERSBURG DIVISION \n \n \nJANE DOE, et al., \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv.         CIVIL  ACTION NO.  6:12-cv-04355 \n \nWOOD COUNTY BOARD OF \nEDUCATION, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \nPending before the court is the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction [Docket 4]. A \nhearing was held on A ugust 27, 2012. The court ho lds today that the option to opt out of a \nsingle-sex education program does not satisfy the requirement under the 2006 United States \nDepartment of Education regulations that sing le-sex programs be “completely voluntary.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(iii). However, the court also finds that the preliminary relief requested by \nthe  plaintiffs is overly broad. Accordingly a nd  for the reasons set forth below, the court \nGRANTS in part and DENIES in part the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \nI.  Background and Procedural History \n \n  This case arises from the single-sex program adopted by Van Devender Middle School  \n(“VDMS”) in a commendable attempt to improve the education of its students. The plaintiffs are \na  mother,  Jane Doe, and her three daughters, Anne Doe, Beth Doe, and Carol Doe. 1  The \ndaughters all attended the sixth grade at VDMS  for the 2011-12 school year, and are currently \nattending the seventh grade for the 2012-13 sc hool year. Defendant W ood County Board of \n                                                 \n1 The plaintiffs are proceeding under pseudonym. \n1 \n \n\nEducation (“WCBE”) is the enti ty responsible for the administ ration of public  schools within \nWood  County, W est  Virginia, including V DMS,  and has overseen and approved the  \nimplementation  of sex-separated classes at   VDMS. Def endant  J.  Patrick  Law  is th e \nsuperintendent of the Wood County Schools, and  is responsible for the adm inistration of all \nschools within the Wood County School District, including VDMS. Defendants Stephen Taylor \nand Penny Coleman are the Principal and Vice Principal, respectively, of VDMS, and have both \noverseen and implemented the sex-separated classes at VDMS. \nVDMS is one of five public middle schools in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Students from \ngrades six through eight are assigned to middle schools by WCBE based on the location of their \nresidence.  In 2010, the WCBE  approved  the single-sex educa tion  program  at VDMS. The \nprogram was adopted for sixth grade classes in the 2010-11 school year, expanded to the seventh \ngrade in 2011-12, and expanded to the eighth  grade for the 2012-13 school year. Classes for  \nreading, math, social studies, and science are separated by gender, while classes in other subjects \nare coeducational.  \nIn May 2012, the Am erican Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to J. Patrick Law of the \nWCBE regarding its opinion that the single-sex program at VDMS violates the Constitution and \nTitle IX. In July 2012, the ACLU followed up on the  letter, stating its intention to bring suit on \nbehalf of the plaintiffs. On August 15, 2012, t he plaintiffs filed this action alleging that the \nsingle-sex classes at VDMS violated the Equal Pr otection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nand Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, as interpreted by  the United States Department of Agriculture \nand Department of Education in their respective regulations, 7 C.F.R. § 15a.34 and 34 C.F.R. § \n106.34. On the same day, the plaintiffs filed a  Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction. \n2 \n \n\n  On August 19, 2012, the court held a hearing  on the motion for a temporary restraining \norder. During that hearing, significant questions  were raised regarding whether the single-sex \nclasses at VDMS were voluntary,  and whether substantially equa l coeducational classes were \noffered at the school. The court denied the plaint iffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, \nholding that the plaintiffs had not made a “clear showing” that they were likely to succeed on the \nmerits. The court noted that the  issues of voluntariness and subs tantial equality needed further \ndevelopment. The court also held that the public  interest would not be furthered by granting a \ntemporary restraining order at the time due to the disruption that it would cause to the students at \nVDMS if the school was forced to m ake a last-minute shift to coeducational classes. However, \nthe court further noted that: \nIf the record developed [at the August  27, 2012 preliminary injunction hearing] \nshows  that the plaintiffs are in fact   likely  to succe ed  on the merits, the \nConstitution and civil rights law will require [the altering of VDMS’s scheduling \nto make it coeducational]. Teachers and schools should be innovative, and should \nbe encouraged to experiment in their attempts to improve the education; however, \nthey must do so within the lines drawn by the Constitution and by the law.  \n \n[Docket 24, at 2.] On August 27, 2012, the court  held a hearing on the instant m otion for \npreliminary injunction.  \nII.  Preliminary Injunction \n \n  The United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit have provided district courts with a precise analytical framework for determining whether \nto grant preliminary relief. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); The \nReal Truth About Obama, Inc. v. FEC , 575 F.3d 342, 346-47 (4th Cir. 2009),  vacated on other \ngrounds, 130 S.Ct. 2371 (2010). First, the plaintiffs m ust make a clear showing that they will \nlikely succeed on the merits.  The Real Truth About Obama, Inc. , 575 F.3d at 346. Second, the \nplaintiffs  must m ake  a clear show ing  that they   are like ly  to be ir reparably  harmed  absent \n3 \n \n\npreliminary relief. Id. Third, the plaintiffs must show that  the balance of equities tips in the ir \nfavor. Id. Finally, the plaintiffs must show that an injunction is in the public interest. Id. All four \nrequirements must be satisfied. Id.  \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n   \nThe plaintiffs assert that the single-sex  classes at VDMS violate the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681. In 2006, the United States \nDepartment of Education (“Departm ent of Education”) issued regulations authorizing public \nschools to offer single-sex education options under certain, specific conditions: \n(i) Each single-sex class or extracurricular activity is ba sed on the re cipient’s \nimportant objective— \n(A)  To i mprove  educational achievem ent  of its students, through a \nrecipient’s  overall established poli cy  to pro vide  diverse  educational \nopportunities,  provided that the singl e-sex  nature of the class or \nextracurricular activity is substantially related to achieving that objective; \nor \n(B) To meet the particular, identified  educational needs  of its students, \nprovided that the single-sex nature of the class or extracurricular activity is \nsubstantially related to achieving that objective; \n(ii) The recipient implements its objective in an evenhanded manner; \n(iii)  Student  enrollment  in a sin gle-sex  class  or extracurricu lar  activity  is \ncompletely voluntary; and \n(iv)  The  recipient  provides  to  all ot her  students, includ ing  students of the \nexcluded sex, a substantially equal coeducational class or extracurricular activity \nin the same subject or activity. \n \n34 C.F.R. §§ 106.34(b)(1)(i)-(iv) (emphasis added). 2 Moreover, the regulations provide several \nfactors  that  the Departm ent  considers when de termining  whether c lasses  or ex tracurricular \nactivities are substantially equal. 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(b)(3).  Finally, the regulations provide for \nperiodic  evaluations by the sc hool  every two years “to ensure   that  single-sex  classes or \nextracurricular activities are based upon genuine justifications and do not rely on overly broad \n                                                 \n2 The language in the regulations refers to “the recipient,” which is “any educational program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance” in Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1681. The WCBE and its schools, \nincluding VDMS, receive federal funds from, inter alia, the Department of Education, and are thus \nrecipients subject to the Department of Education regulations. \n4 \n \n\ngeneralizations about the different  talents, capacities, or prefer ences of either sex.” 34 C.F.R.  \n§ 106.34(b)(4).  The D epartment  of Education re gulations  thus establish some authority \npermitting a narrow exception to the general rule of coeducation, to allow schools to experiment \nwith single-sex programs to improve educational achievement. See Doe ex rel. Doe v. Vermilion \nParish Sch. Bd., 421 F. App’x 366, 369 (5th Cir. 2011) (“Th e Department of Education and the \nDepartment of Justice have filed an amicus brief . . . describing these regulations as permitting a \nnarrow exception to the general rule of coeducation.”). The language in these regulations closely \ntracks the legal standards established by the United States Suprem e Court in  United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996).  \ni.  The Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on Their Title IX Claim Because \nRequiring Parents to Opt Out of Single-Sex Classes does not Make the \nProgram Completely Voluntary. Rather, Affirmative Assent by the \nParents is Required. \n \n  The Department of Education did not define th e phrase “completely voluntary” when it \nadopted  the 2006 regulations. Howe ver,  the discussion leading  up  to the adoption of the \nregulation, particularly subsection (iii), provides some insight on the meaning of the phrase. The \ndiscussion first states that: \nThe proposed regulations in § 106.34(b)(1)(ii) were intended to require recipients \nto offer single-sex classes only on a completely voluntary basis, by requiring a \nrecipient to provide a coeducational class in the same subject, in conjunction with \nthe requirement in § 106.34(a) that a reci pient may not require participation in \nclasses on the basis of sex. \n \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Educa tion Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 71 Fed. Reg. 62530, 62537 (Oct. 25, 2006). The discussion then states: \nIn  order to   ensure tha t  participation  in any single -sex  class  is co mpletely \nvoluntary, if a single-sex class is of fered, the recipient is strongly encouraged to \nnotify parents, guardians, and students about  their option to enroll in either a \nsingle-sex  or coeducational class   and receive authorization from parents or \nguardians to enroll their children in a single-sex class. \n5 \n \n\n \nId. (emphasis added). The court holds today that the Department of Education regulations require \nan affirmative assent by parents or guardians  before placing children in single-sex classrooms. \nSuch affirmative assent would preferably come in the form of a written, signed agreement by the \nparent explicitly opting into a single-sex program. An opt-out pr ovision is insufficient to meet \nthe requirement that single-sex classes be “completely voluntary” for several reasons. First, the \nabove  discussion  leading  to the ad dition  of th e  “completely  voluntary” language strongly \nsuggests that this outcome is proper. The regulations closely track the language of United States \nv. Virginia, yet the co mmentators and drafters ultimately felt the need to add a n additional \nelement of voluntariness, “clearly requiring that student participation in a single-sex class m ust \nbe completely voluntary.” 71 Fed. Reg. at 62537. \nMoreover, because single-sex classes are, by their very nature, a gender classification, it \nmakes perfect sense to require  the parent or guardian’s  clear and affirmative assent. While a \nfailure to opt out may be a legal substitute for agreement in some other areas of the law, such as \nmembership in class actions,3 presuming that parents or guardians have enrolled their child in a \nsingle-sex class completely voluntarily because they failed to opt out would undermine the \npurpose of Title IX to prevent discrimination based on gender. \nFinally, this reading of the Departm ent of Education regulations is supported by the \nmeaning of the word “voluntary.” Black’s Law Di ctionary defines “voluntary” as “[d]one by \ndesign or intention.” B LACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1569 (7th ed. 1999). The first word in the \ndefinition, “done,” indicates that the actor must do something—in other words, an affir mative \nact. The phrase “by design or intent ion” indicates that the actor must have decided upon the act \n                                                 \n3 See, e.g., Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (“We reject petitioner’s contention that the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that absent plaintiffs affirmatively ‘opt in’ to \nthe class, rather than be deemed members of the class if they do not ‘opt out.’”). \n6 \n \n\nthat was taken. In other words, the definition of the word “voluntary” suggests that one cannot be \nsaid to have agreed to something voluntarily if they have not taken an affirmative act to agree to \nit. \n  The evidence, even as presented by the defendants, shows that the single-sex program at \nVDMS was presented solely in an opt-out m anner to parents and guardians of the children \nattending VDMS. Counsel for the defendants referenced the opt-out form sent to the parents via \nmail  this year and the opt-out script sent to   the parents via telephone this year. Cross-\nexamination of Jane Doe focused in part on her  ability to opt out.  Direct examination of the \ndefendant Stephen Taylor focused in part on th e opt-out forms sent to parents for the 2010-11, \n2011-12, and 2012-13 school years. The defense o ffered an exhibit entitled “Van Devender \nMiddle School Opt-out form,” which states, in part: “My signature  on this form indicates that I \nam requesting that my child be placed in a coed class.” [Def. Ex. 6 (emphasis added).] At no \npoint do the defendants dispute th at the form of notice given to  the parents was that of opting \nout, rather than opting in. \n   The court also finds significant the tim ing of the opt-out notices sent to the parents and \nguardians. The record reflects that letters suggesting that parent s may opt out of the single-sex \nprogram, and the opt-out forms, were not made available to the parents and guardians until very \nclose to the beginning of each school year. For the 2012-1 3 school year, the record establishes \nthat a meeting was held on August 16, 2012 with a  form giving parents the option to opt-out. A  \nphone recording was sent to pare nts the night before school bega n, and a letter was sent on the \nday that school began on August 23, 2012. For th e 2011-12 school year, th e record shows that \nforms were mailed out on or about August 18,  2011, while the school year was scheduled to \nbegin approximately a week later. Testimony from Carol Doe reveals that she had already made \n7 \n \n\nthe cheerleading team before any option to opt  out was presented to the parents. The close \nproximity of the notices to the beginning of the school year, after students have already enrolled, \nsuggest that their choice was not  fully voluntary. As the record  reflects, students opting out of \nsingle-sex classes would be sent to a different school if not  enough students at VDMS opted to \ntake a coeducational class. \nThe court does not decide the question of wh ether single-sex classes violate the E qual \nProtection Clause. Rather, the cou rt finds, as discussed, that th e defendants have not m et their \nburden  to ensure that single-sex classes  at  VDMS are “com pletely  voluntary” under the \nDepartment  of Education regulations. Thus, the c ourt  finds that the plai ntiffs  are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their Title IX claim. \nB.  The Plaintiffs are Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent Preliminary \nRelief \n \n  The court finds that the plaintiffs’ continue d participation in single-sex classes without \nhaving completely voluntarily chosen that option constitutes irreparable harm. Other courts have \nfound that a violation o f Title IX m ay constitute irreparable harm, and this court agrees.  See \nMcCormick ex rel. McCormick v. Sch. Dist. of Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 301-02 n.25 (2d Cir. \n2004); Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric. , 998 F.2d 824, 833 (10th Cir. 1993). Here, the \nplaintiffs have shown that their participation in single-sex classes was not completely voluntary, \nand having them remain in single-sex classes would be a continuing violation of Title IX. See id.  \n  The court does recognize the conflicting testimony between the plaintiffs and Ms. Hahn, \none of the teachers that testified for the defense. Ms. Hahn’s testimony indicated that she did not \nengage in gender stereotyping, but instead taught her classes according to the individual needs of \nthe children. The court does not su ggest that teachers should teach in any particular way, and \nappreciates the teachers’ attempts to find new ways to teach and engage their students. The court \n8 \n \n\nemphasizes that the ir reparable harm in this  case is not the way the child ren at VDMS are  \ntaught—the  court does not decide that issue—but  rather the lack of   a voluntary choice to \nparticipate in single-sex classes as required under the Department of Education regulations. \nC.  The Balance of Equities Tips in the Plaintiffs’ Favor \n \n  The court finds that the injury to the plaintiffs outweighs the harm to the defendants in \ngranting a preliminary injunction. The defendants would suffer the administrative inconvenience \nof revising course schedules after the school year has already begun to provide for coeducational \nclasses. This inconvenience will not be a grea t burden to the defendants. The Principal of  \nVDMS, Stephen Taylor, testified during the August 18, 2012 hearing that the school already has \na coeducational program ready to be implemented. Furthermore, the WCBE and VDMS certainly \nhave the experience and ability to run coeducational classes, as they have done for years prior to \nthe implementation of the single-sex program in 2010. On the other hand, absent a prelim inary \ninjunction, the plaintiffs would continue to suffer from their involuntary placement in single-sex \nclassrooms. Moreover, the plaintiffs Anne Doe, Beth Doe, and Carol Doe will experience their \nmiddle school years only once during their life. \nD.  The Public Interest Favors a Preliminary Injunction \n \n  The  court finds that a prelim inary  injunction  would be in the p ublic  interest.  A \npreliminary injunction would preven t the continued violation of th e plaintiffs’ Title IX rights, \nand that of any other parent who m ay not have opted out, but would not have opted in if they \nwere properly presented with that option. The pub lic interest is certainly served by promoting \ncompliance with Title IX. See Barrett v. West Chester Univ. of Pa. of State Sys. of Higher Educ., \nNo. 03-cv-4978, 2003 WL 22803477, at  *15 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2003);  Cohen v. Brown Univ., \n809 F. Supp. 978, 1001 (D.R.I. 1992). \n9 \n \n\nThe rationale behind a grant of a preliminary injunction has been explained as preserving \nthe status quo so that the court can render a m eaningful decision after a trial on the merits. Rum \nCreek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 926 F.2d 353, 359 (4th Cir. 1991); Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d \n722,  727 (4th Cir. 1986). The status quo, however, does “not consist of a photographic  \nreplication  of the circu mstances  existing  at the  moment  suit was f iled,  but ra ther  the  last \npeaceable uncontested status that existed before the dispute arose.”  Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d \n226,  237-38 (4th Cir. 1993) (Ham ilton,  J. dissenti ng).  Here, the court finds that the “las t \npeaceable uncontested status” was when VDMS offe red coeducational classrooms, particularly \nas coeducational education is still the general rule. \nIII.  Scope of the Preliminary Injunction \n \n  The  plaintiffs,  in essen ce,  take th e  position  that no single-sex classes would ever \nwithstand  scrutiny  under the Con stitution  or  Title IX.   The court finds this   argument \nunpersuasive. Specifically, the court notes that: \nNo legal authority supports the conclusi on that optional single-sex program s in \npublic  schools are  ipso  facto  injurious to the school s’  students. Unlike the \nseparation of public school students by race, th e separation of students by sex \ndoes not give rise to a finding of constitutional injury as a matter of law. \n \nA.N.A. ex rel. S.F.A. v. Breckinr idge Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 833 F. Supp. 2d 673, 678 ( W.D. Ky. \n2011). In fact, the United States S upreme Court has found exactly the opposite of what the \nplaintiffs suggest. See United States v. Virginia , 518 U.S. at 533 & n.7 (stating that “[t]he  \nheightened  review s tandard  our p recedent  establishes  does  not make sex   a proscribed \nclassification,” and not questioning Virginia’s  “prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse \neducational opportunities.”). Rather, if the school  meets the heightened scrutiny set forth in \nUnited  States v. Virginia ,  single-sex  classes  can certainly be constitu tional.  Similarly,  the \nDepartment of Education also disagrees with this view: the 2006 regulations explicitly allow for \n10 \n \n\na narrow exception to the general rule of co educational classes, and schools can certainly avoid \nviolating Title IX in implementing single-sex classes by complying with these regulations. \n  Based on this position, the plaintiffs ask fo r preliminary relief not only to enjoin the \ndefendants from segregating VDMS based on sex,  but also to enjoin the implementation of any \ngender-based training techniques at the school. The  court is not willing to go this far. The court \nsees no reason to enjoin the defendants from implementing single-sex education programs and \nsingle-sex classrooms as long as they are acting within the boundaries set by the Constitution and \nTitle IX; it is only to the extent that VDMS’s current single-sex program violates the law that the \ndefendants must be enjoined.  \nIV.  Conclusion \n \n  The  court again em phasizes  that its deci sion  today rests on the  requirement  of  the \nDepartment of Education regulations that sing le-sex programs be “completely voluntary.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(iii). The court does not subs titute its judgment for that of local school \nadministrators  and teachers regarding the bene fits  or drawbacks of single-sex education. \nHowever, the court does note that the science behi nd single-sex education appears to be, at best, \ninconclusive, and certain gender-based teaching techniques based on stereotypes and lacking any \nscientific basis may very well be harmful to students. Eve n Professor Salomone, the expert \nwitness called by the d efense, agreed with the  ACLU on the issue of brain research—that it’s \nbased on the rationale of pseudoscience—and suggested that many schools were “led astray” by \nthe teachings of Dr. Le onard Sax. Professor Salo mone served as an expert witn ess for the \ndefense not because she agreed with the gender-based teaching techniques, but because she felt \nthat the individual teachers at VDMS were, in fact,  not teaching students based on gender \nstereotype, despite the training given by Dr. Sax and David Chadwell.  \n11 \n \n\n  The court strongly believes that educators should be in charge of educating, and strongly \nencourages  teachers an d  schools to adopt i nnovative  learning tech niques  to improve our  \nstruggling education system. No one is better suited to develop effective teaching methods than \nour  public school teachers. Th e  teachers, through their under appreciated  service in the \nclassroom, are in the best position to determine what it takes to reach their students in ways that \nno laws or regulations can anticipate. It is admirable that the teachers at VDMS are attempting to \nfind different ways to connect with their students. \n  Thus, the court does not wish to interfere  with or stifle innova tion in our education \nsystem. However, it is the court’s duty to ensu re that the governm ent complies with the law. \nWithout making any findings regarding the evidence heard on the merits of VDMS’s single-sex \nclasses, or single-sex curricula generally, the co urt finds that the requirem ents set forth by the \nDepartment of Education under Title IX that  single-sex programs be “completely voluntary” \nmeans that there m ust be unequivocal assent to participation given by  parents of all students \ninvolved. Lacking that assent, a student must have the “substantially equal” alternative promised \nby the regulations, although this court declines to define today what that alternative must entail.  \nBecause the court FINDS, for the reasons stated above , that VDMS’s program was not \ncompletely voluntary, the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction [Docket 4] is GRANTED \nin part and DENI ED in part. The court hereby  ENJOINS the defendants from  separating \nstudents into single-sex classes at Van Devender Middle School for the remainder of the 2012-13 \nschool year, and unless and until  any single-sex program offered meets the requirements of the \nConstitution and Title IX, in particular the Department of Education regulations as interpreted by \nthe court today. This injunction will take eff ect at the beginning of the school day on Monday, \nSeptember 3, 2012. \n12 \n \n\nThe court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Or der to counsel of record and any \nunrepresented party. The court further  DIRECTS the Clerk to post a copy of this published \nopinion on the court’s website, www.wvsd.uscourts.gov. \nENTER:  August 29, 2012 \n13 ",

CIVIL  ACTION NO.  6:12-cv-04355 \n \nWOOD COUNTY BOARD OF  \nEDUCATION, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nORDER \n \n  A hearing was held o n the plaintiffs’ motion for a tem porary restraining order. The \nplaintiffs, Jane Doe, Anne Doe, Beth Doe,  and Carol Doe filed a Motion for a Tem porary \nRestraining Order and Preliminary Injunction [Docket 4] against the defendants Wood County \nBoard of Education, J. Patrick Law, Stephen Taylor, and Penny Tonelli Coleman, to restrain and \nenjoin the defendants from implementing single-sex instruction at Van Devender Middle School.  \nBased on the record before the Court on the motion for a temporary restraining order, the \nCourt FINDS that the plaintiff has not made a “clear showing” that they are likely to succeed on \nthe merits. See The Real Truth About Obama, Inc. v. FEC, 575 F.3d 342, 346-47 (4th Cir. 2009), \nvacated  on other grounds ,  130 S.Ct. 2371 (2010). T wo  significant  issues require further \ndevelopment before the legal questions presented can be resolved.  The first is the voluntariness \nof  the single-sex classes offered at the school .  The second is whether substantially equal \ncoeducational classes are offered at the school.  \n\nCase 6:12-cv-04355   Document 24   Filed 08/21/12   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 518\nFurthermore, the Court FINDS that the public interest would not be furthered by granting \na temporary restraining order. Van Devender Middle School has  had its single-sex program for \ntwo years, and to alter the school’s scheduling when classes begin later this week would disrupt \nthe lives of the young children attending the school. \n  If the record developed next week shows that the plaintiffs are in fact likely to succeed on \nthe merits, the Constitution and civil rights law will requir e this disruption to Van Devende r \nMiddle  School.  Teachers and schools should be  innovative,  and should be encouraged to  \nexperiment in their attempts to improve the education of children; however, they m ust do so \nwithin the lines drawn by the Constitution and by the law. \nThe Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary  restraining order [Docket 4]. A \npreliminary injunction hearing will be held in this m atter on August 27, 2012, at 1:30 p.m. in \nCharleston, West Virginia. Also before the Court is Pla intiffs’ Motion for Leave to Proceed \nUnder Pseudonym [Docket 16], which is unopposed, and for reasons  appearing to the Court, is \nGRANTED. \nThe court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Or der to counsel of record and any \nunrepresented party. \nENTER:  August 20, 2012 \n \n ",
