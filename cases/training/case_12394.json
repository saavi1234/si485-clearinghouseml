    "summary": "<p>Plaintiffs, thirteen current and former foster children, brought suit against the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) in the Washington state Whatcom County Superior Court in August 1998. The plaintiffs brought claims under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, 42 U.S. C. §§ 671 et seq, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and numerous state statutes and regulations. We have some documents related to this case, but much of our information is from the relevant National Center for Youth Law <a href=\"http://www.youthlaw.org/litigation/ncyl_cases/child_welfare/5/\">webpage</a>, and from a <a href=\"http://braampanel.org/\">website</a> set up by the oversight panel that implemented the settlement agreement.</p><p>In July 2000, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class of all children who are now or will be in the custody of DSHS foster care system and who were placed in three or more placements. In June 2001, Judge Nichols certified the class. Defendant DSHS moved for summary judgment. As a result, the trial court dismissed all claims based on procedural due process, the Washington State Constitution, and most claims based on state and federal child welfare and disability statutes.</p><p>The parties agreed to try the case before a jury, and following a seven week trial in October 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs. The trial court entered a broad injunction, mandating the recruitment of new foster parents, notification prior to placement changes, arrangements to improve education, additional training and institutional support of foster parents, and increased emphasis on the preservation of sibling relationships. The trial court ordered the plaintiffs to monitor compliance.</p><p>The State appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case for appeal to the Washington Supreme Court. See Braam v. State, 81 P.3d 851 (Wash. 2003). Judge Chambers for the Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that foster children possessed substantive due process rights that the State was required to respect, but there was erroneous jury instruction on the State's culpability.</p><p>Upon remand, the trial court ordered the parties to mediation. The parties reached a settlement in July 2004. The settlement provided for an independent panel to collaborate with DSHS to establish benchmarks for in six identified areas. The panel released an implementation plan in February 2006. Additionally, the panel issued monitoring reports every six months. </p><p>In January 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, based on the State's failures to complete steps in the implementation plan. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on June 30, 2008, finding the State had failed to comply with the plan. In June 2009, the parties reached an agreement to provide for fees and costs for the remainder of the settlement agreement.</p><p>In 2011, DSHS and the plaintiffs modified the settlement agreement and extended the agreement until December 31, 2013. The revised agreement provides for the oversight panel to continue monitoring through 2012, and provide annual monitor reports.  The agreement remains in effect after this monitoring ceases, however.  </p>",

(JUDGE DAVID A. NICHOLS) \n14   \n  Defendants. \n15   \n \n16 \n17   \nCOME NOW Plaintiffs, by and through their attorneys, Brett & Daugert, Timothy C. \n18 \nFarris of counsel, and as for their cause of action allege as follows: \n19 \n20  I.  PARTIES \n21  1.1  J.B. is a minor child and a resident of Whatcom County, Washington.  She brings \n22 \nthis lawsuit by and through her guardians, Dale and Vickie Braam.  The Department placed J.B. \n23 \nin at least 15 different placements across the State of Washington during a ten-year period.  The \n24 \nState placed J.B. with the Braam family, who had inadequate training to parent a child with \n25 \n26  Page 1 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O. BOX 5008 \nBELLINGHAM, WA 98227-5008 \nTELEPHONE: (360) 733-0212 (cid:1) FAX: (360) 647-1902 \nwww. brettlaw.com \n \n \n \n\n \n1  J.B.’s problems.  The Defendant did not offer the Braam family training to adequately care for \n2 \nJ.B.’s needs.  J.B. is a brittle diabetic, and the Defendant placed her into a foster home that had \n3 \nno training whatsoever in the management of diabetes.  As a result of the lack of training, J.B.’s \n4 \nhealth was significantly endangered within days of her placement in this foster home.  The State \n5 \nunnecessarily separated J.B. from her three brothers and her sister.  The Defendant did not \n6 \nprovide J.B. with adequate and appropriate mental health therapy.  J.B. is representative of the \n7 \nclass because she has experienced multiple placements, was separated from siblings, was placed \n8 \n9  with foster parents who were untrained to care for her, and was denied necessary mental health \n10  treatment. \n11 \n1.2  T.O. is a minor child and a resident of Pierce County, Washington.  He brings this \n12 \nlawsuit by and through his guardians, David and Diane Olson.  T.O. entered foster care when he \n13 \nwas six months old, and the State placed T.O. in at least ten placements during his first three \n14 \nyears in foster care.  When T.O. was two years old, the State separated him from his older \n15 \nbrother.  When T.O. was three years old, he was found to be high priority for mental health care.  \n16 \nThe State placed his name on a waiting list and wrote that unless there is a crisis, he would have \n17 \n18  to wait for an opening.  This child is representative of the class because he has experienced \n19  multiple placements, was unnecessarily separated from his sibling, and was denied necessary \n20 \nmental health treatment. \n21 \n1.3  S.S. is a minor child and a resident of King County, Washington.  He brings this \n22 \nlawsuit by and through his court-appointed guardian ad litem, Cat Zavis.  S.S. entered foster care \n23 \nwhen he was four years old and lived in at least 12 foster placements by the time he was nine \n24 \nyears old.  The State separated S.S. from his four siblings and placed him in unsafe/inappropriate \n25 \n26  Page 2 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O. BOX 5008 \nBELLINGHAM, WA 98227-5008 \nTELEPHONE: (360) 733-0212 (cid:1) FAX: (360) 647-1902 \nwww. brettlaw.com \n \n \n \n\n \n1  placements where the foster parents were not trained in how to deal with his behavior.  One \n2 \nuntrained foster parent disciplined him by twisting his nipples until they bled, and another made \n3 \nhim eat hot peppers when she suspected he was lying.  This child is representative of the class \n4 \nbecause he has experienced multiple placements, separation from siblings, was placed with foster \n5 \nparents who were untrained to care for him, and was placed in unsafe/inappropriate placements. \n6 \n1.4  I.H. is a minor child and a resident of King County, Washington.  She brings this \n7 \nlawsuit by and through her guardians, David and Mary Hardin.  I.H. lived in no less than 45 \n8 \n9  placements during the time she was in foster care.  When I.H. was four years old, the State \n10  separated her from her sisters and brother.  The State did not approve the type or amount of \n11 \ntherapy that was recommended for I.H. and did not provide her with therapy when she first \n12 \nentered foster care, despite allegations that her biological father sexually abused her.  Many of \n13 \nthe foster homes the State placed I.H. in were not trained to handle I.H.’s behaviors.  When the \n14 \nState had no placement options available for her, she had to sleep on the floor in the DSHS \n15 \noffices or had to remain in detention until a placement was found.  I.H. was raped while living in \n16 \na foster home by a boy who lived in the foster home.  This child is representative of the class \n17 \n18  because she has experienced multiple placements, was separated from her siblings, was denied \n19  necessary mental health treatment, was placed with foster parents who were untrained to care for \n20 \nher, was placed with foster parents who were not informed of her history, and was placed in \n21 \nunsafe placements. \n22 \n1.5  E.H. is a minor child and a resident of King County, Washington.  E.H. lived in \n23 \nno less than 24 placements during the time she was in foster care.  When E.H. was three years \n24 \nold, the State separated her from her sisters and brother.  The State did not provide her with \n25 \n26  Page 3 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O. BOX 5008 \nBELLINGHAM, WA 98227-5008 \nTELEPHONE: (360) 733-0212 (cid:1) FAX: (360) 647-1902 \nwww. brettlaw.com \n \n \n \n\n \n1  therapy when she first entered foster care, despite physical evidence that her biological father \n2 \nsexually abused her, and provided her with inadequate mental health therapy while in foster care.  \n3 \nE.H. brings this lawsuit by and through her guardians, David and Mary Hardin.  This child is \n4 \nrepresentative of the class because she has experienced multiple placements, was separated from \n5 \nher siblings, was denied necessary mental health treatment. \n6 \n1.6  T.C. is a minor child and a resident of Island County, Washington.  He brings this \n7 \nlawsuit by and through his guardians, Kevin and Traci Christensen.  T.C. was placed in one \n8 \n9  foster home after another who were untrained to care for him.  When DSHS placed him in the \n10  home of Kevin Christensen, DSHS failed to provide the Christensens with the child’s Health and \n11 \nEducation Record, Passport or the Child and Family Medical Report.  Despite the fact that \n12 \napproximately ten previous foster homes were unable to care for T.C., DSHS placed T.C. in the \n13 \nChristensen home where the parents had no training on how to care for a special-needs child, no \n14 \nexperience and where one had a high school degree and the other was a high school dropout.  \n15 \nThe Christensens were deceived into adopting T.C..  Like many other children in the class who \n16 \nare adopted, the adoption disrupted and T.C. is back in foster care where his parents have had to \n17 \n18  fight DSHS to get adequate care and mental health care for him.  This child is representative of \n19  the class because he has experienced multiple placements, was placed with foster parents who \n20 \nwere untrained to care for him, was placed with foster parents who were not informed of his \n21 \nhistory, was separated from his siblings, and was denied necessary mental health care.   \n22 \n1.7  S.T. is a minor child and is represented by her adoptive parents Janie and Larry \n23 \nReynolds.  S.T. was two years of age when she was placed in foster care.  Defendant moved her \n24 \napproximately 20 times in about two and a half years.  As a little girl, her only remaining family \n25 \n26  Page 4 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O. BOX 5008 \nBELLINGHAM, WA 98227-5008 \nTELEPHONE: (360) 733-0212 (cid:1) FAX: (360) 647-1902 \nwww. brettlaw.com \n \n \n \n\n \n1  was a sibling, but Defendant separated S.T. from her brother and forced her to live alone.  S.T. \n2 \ndeveloped health and mental health issues and was placed in foster homes that were inadequately \n3 \ntrained/informed to care for her, resulting in the removal of her from these homes.  This child is \n4 \nrepresentative of the class because she has experienced multiple placements, was placed with \n5 \nfoster parents who were untrained to care for her, was unnecessarily separated from her sibling, \n6 \nwas denied necessary mental health treatment and was placed in unsafe placements.   \n7 \n1.8  M.J. is a minor child who brings this action through his guardian ad litem, Cat \n8 \n9  Zavis.  M.J. is a resident of the Epic Crisis Residential Center in Yakima County, Washington.  \n10  He has been in over seven placements since November 2003.  Twice, he was placed in foster \n11 \nhomes where the caregiver did not speak English, the only language M.J. speaks.  He requested \n12 \nmental health treatment, and Defendant told him to go to a Regional Support Network – although \n13 \nM.J. had no car and could not drive.  He has been placed in a secure CRC for over a month even \n14 \nthough by law this type of placement is only an emergency, temporary residence.  M.J. was \n15 \nseparated from his siblings.   He is  representative of the class because he has experienced \n16 \nmultiple placements, has been denied/delayed inadequate mental health care, has been placed in \n17 \n18  inappropriate placements, and has been unnecessarily separated from his siblings. \n19  1.9  H.C.J.D. is a 14-year-old male who brings this action through his guardian ad \n20 \nlitem, Cat Zavis.  H.C.J.D. is currently a resident of Spokane County.  H.C.J.D. has been \n21 \nsubjected to over 20 different placements.  He has developmental delays and significant mental \n22 \nhealth issues.  DCFS put him in inpatient treatment at an adult psychiatric hospital and left him \n23 \nthere  for  over  two  months  because  the  Defendant  couldn’t  find  him  a  “more  appropriate” \n24 \n(DCFS’ statement) placement.  The doctors notified DSHS that the placement was “extremely \n25 \n26  Page 5 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O. BOX 5008 \nBELLINGHAM, WA 98227-5008 \nTELEPHONE: (360) 733-0212 (cid:1) FAX: (360) 647-1902 \nwww. brettlaw.com \n \n \n \n\n \n1  inappropriate” and “counter-therapeutic” and asked that he be transferred after a few weeks \n2 \nbecause his mental health was stabilized. The hospital has no programs for adolescents.   The \n3 \ncourt-appointed social worker indicated that the facility was “being inappropriately used as a \n4 \nhousing resource,” and that “it appears necessary to have the Department court ordered to find \n5 \nemergency shelter, as they exhibit no urgency while he is securely confined in the current \n6 \nfacility.”  He has been separated from his siblings. He is representative of the class because he \n7 \nhas been subjected to multiple placements, denial of adequate mental health care, placements in \n8 \n9  an inappropriate and unsafe placement and unnecessary separation from his siblings. \n10  1.10  M.L. is a minor child who brings this action through his guardian ad litem, Cat \n11 \nZavis.  M.L. is a resident of Yakima County.  M.L. has been subjected to ten or more placements \n12 \nand was inappropriately placed in the Yakima detox facility for three days and commingled with \n13 \nadult substance abusers.  M.L. is representative of the class because he has been subjected to \n14 \nmultiple placements and placement in an inappropriate/unsafe placement. \n15 \n1.11  J.S. is a minor child who brings this action through his guardian ad litem, Cat \n16 \nZavis.  J.S. is a resident of King County.  J.S. has been subjected to more than ten placements.  \n17 \n18  J.S. had orthodontia braces put on to correct his teeth.  He had braces on for over three years, and \n19  for at least one year after they were ready to be removed, because Defendant refused to pay to \n20 \nremove the braces.  J.S.’s teeth were significantly damaged as a result.  He is representative of \n21 \nthe class because he has been subjected to multiple placements and has been denied adequate \n22 \nhealth care. \n23 \n1.12  D.K.A. is a 14-year-old minor who brings this action through his parent, Derick \n24 \nD. Allen.  D.K.A. is a resident of King County.  D.K.A. has been in three or more placements \n25 \n26  Page 6 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O.

D.K.A. was moved out of an appropriate foster home because the State \n2 \nwanted to pay a lower rate to his foster parents.  D.K.A.’s move to a stable placement with his \n3 \nfather was delayed for almost a year solely because of errors by the Defendant.

CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN \n8 \n9  2.1  Plaintiffs are children who are now (or who in the future will be) in the custody of \n10  the Department of Social & Health Services foster care system and who while in DSHS custody \n11 \nare placed by the defendants in three or more placements.  \n12 \n2.2  The children have a “substantive due process right to be free from unreasonable \n13 \nrisk of harm, including a risk flowing from the lack of basic services, and a right to reasonable \n14 \nsafety…the State, as custodian and caretaker of foster children must provide conditions free of \n15 \nunreasonable risk of danger, harm, or pain, and must include adequate services to meet the basic \n16 \nneeds of the child.”   Braam v. State of Washington, 150 Wn.2d 689, 699-700 (2004).  This is a \n17 \n18  “broad” right that encompasses all services “reasonably necessary in protecting the child from \n19  harm,” Id. at 699, n.4, and “harm” must be “given its ordinary meaning of physical or mental \n20 \ndamage,” Id. at 700.   \n21 \n2.3  The Defendants violate the substantive due process rights of the children by the \n22 \nfollowing actions, failures to act, and practices, among others.  These actions, failures to act, and \n23 \npractices,  among  others,  individually  and  collectively,  substantially  depart  from  accepted \n24 \nprofessional standards and practices and subject the children to danger, harm, and pain, and to \n25 \n26  Page 9 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O.

These unnecessary and avoidable placements changes are proximately \n15 \ncaused by the defendants’ failures to provide adequate basic services and safety to \n16  children in the class as described above;  \n•  The Defendants fail to provide reasonably safe and secure homes which result in \n17  children leaving foster care without an adequate education or independent living \nskills and forcing them into homelessness, thus subjecting the children to harm \n18 \nand an unreasonable risk of harm; \n•  The Defendants subject children in the class to harm and an unreasonable risk of \n19 \nharm by failing to search for children who run away from the state foster care \n20  system  and  allowing  foster  children  to  be  homeless  (or  in  other  non-state \nsanctioned placements) to avoid having to provide services to children; \n21  •  The Defendants fail to regularly and frequently visit children in the class and as \ndirect and proximate result fail to determine and provide for the special needs of \n22 \nchildren,  fail  to  provide  adequate  support  to  foster  parents,  fail  to  prevent \nbreakdowns  in  placements,  fail  to  uncover  unsafe  and/or  in  appropriate \n23 \nplacements; and \n24  •  When adolescent foster children run away from a foster care placement (because \nof the harsh conditions) DSHS does not actively search for those children and \n25 \n26  Page 10 – FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT  BRETT & DAUGERT, PLLC \n \n  A T T O R N E Y S   A T   L A W  \n  300 NORTH COMMERCIAL (cid:1) P.O.

The Defendants’ actions and failures to act described above violate the children’s \n3 \nsubstantive due process rights and subject the children the unreasonable ongoing risk of danger, \n4 \n5  and harm, and to that physical and mental harm and damage as set forth herein.   \n6  III.  CLASS ACTION \n7 \n3.1  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  as  a  class  action  with  respect  to  particular  issues \n8 \npursuant to Washington Court Rules, Rule 23 (a), (b)(1), (b)(2). The plaintiff class includes “all \n9 \nchildren who are now (or who in the future will be) in the custody of the Department of Social \n10 \nand Health Services foster care system and who while in DSHS custody are placed by Defendant \n11 \nin three or more placements. (Court’s Order Granting Class Certification, July 30, 2001) \n12 \n3.2  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Currently, \n13 \n14  there are approximately 10,000 children in DCFS custody.  Almost one-third of the current \n15  population  of  children  in  custody  have  been  in  three  or  more  placements  while  in  the \n16 \nDefendants’ custody. \n17 \n3.3  There are questions of law and fact common to the class which include whether \n18 \nspecific decisions of DSHS violated the foster children's right to be free from unreasonable risk \n19 \nof harm or violated their right to reasonable safety and whether the decisions substantially \n20 \ndeparted from accepted professional judgment, standards, or practice.  \n21 \n22  3.4  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class. \n23  3.5  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class as to the \n24 \nparticular issues for which the action is maintained as a class action.

BREACH OF DUTY \n7 \n4.1  The State of Washington violates the Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Rights through one \n8 \n9  or more of the decisions identified herein which result in one or more of the actions and practices \n10  identified in 2.3. \n11  V.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n12 \n5.1  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief enjoining the State from further use of the actions \n13 \nand practices which violate the Constitutional rights of children in foster care and for such \n14 \nfurther injunctive relief as may be necessary to protect the constitutional rights of children in the \n15 \nState foster care system.   \n16 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment as follows: \n17 \n18  1.

Among other things, the respondents seek to force\nDSHS through a variety of legal claims to drastically reduce the number of times foster children are moved while\nin the State's care. Most of the claims were dismissed before or during trial, and the case went to the jury on\nwhether the class's claimed substantive due process right to \"the exercise of professional judgment, standards or\npractices\" had been violated. The jury made two findings: (1) that the class's constitutional rights, as defined in\nthe jury instructions, had been violated, and (2) that the violation had harmed the class. Based on that verdict and\nadditional findings made by the trial judge, a broad injunction substantially governing the State's foster care\nsystem was entered.\nToday we must decide whether the court below mistook the appropriate substantive due process standard of care\nfor the right itself. We are also asked to decide whether the trial court properly dismissed certain state and federal\nstatutory claims, whether the injunction was overly broad, whether the class should be judicially estopped from\n\nchanging its articulation of the alleged substantive due process right, and to resolve several procedural and\nevidentiary issues.\nWe hold that the jury was incorrectly instructed on the foster children's substantive due process rights. We\nreverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nFACTS\nWashington's foster care system is charged with the sad duty of caring for children whose families are unable to\ndo so. Ch. 13.34 RCW; ch. 74.13 RCW; see generally Report of Proceedings (RP) at 1580-82, 2054-55. Many of\nthe children entering into foster care have been severely abused. Many have been physically or emotionally\nneglected. Some children in foster care are moved frequently, which may create or exacerbate existing\n[1]\npsychological conditions, notably reactive attachment disorder.  The Washington State Legislature has\nspecifically recognized that \"[p]lacement disruptions can be harmful to children by denying them consistent and\nnurturing support.\" RCW 74.13.310.\nChildren's advocates across the nation began bringing litigation decades ago in an attempt to force states to\n855 improve their foster care systems.[2] In August 1998, respondents *855 joined the fray, filing this lawsuit in\nWhatcom County Superior Court, originally seeking money damages in tort for injuries to foster children. Two\nyears later, the plaintiffs added a claim for injunctive relief and sought certification as a class action. The class\neventually certified included \"[a]ll children who are now (or who in the future will be) in the custody of the\nDepartment of Health and Social Services foster care system and who while in DSHS custody are placed by the\nDefendants in three or more placements.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 275. The tort claims of the named plaintiffs\nwere settled before trial. Ultimately, only injunctive relief was sought.\nThe trial court dismissed all claims based on procedural due process, 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(C) and the Washington\nState Constitution. It also dismissed most of the claims based on state and federal child welfare and disability\nstatutes. However, the trial judge denied the State's motion for summary judgment on the class's substantive due\nprocess claim. The trial court also made several evidentiary rulings before trial, limiting the State's use of\nevidence of fiscal constraints, and denying the State's motion to exclude three named plaintiffs who had \"aged\nout\" of the class.\n[3]\nThe parties agreed to try this case to a jury and to be bound by its verdict.  During trial, the court denied a\nmotion to decertify the class and dismissed most of the plaintiffs' remaining statutory claims. Over the State's\nobjection, the court allowed the plaintiffs to refer to those and other statutes and to state regulations during the\ntrial as evidence of the State's duties.\nAfter the plaintiffs rested, the court dismissed the remaining statutory claims, the three named plaintiffs about\nwhom no testimony was presented, and all claims against former DSHS Secretary Lyle Quasim. The court denied\na motion to restrict the class to children with at least five placements.\nMeanwhile, characterization of the substantive due process right at issue had changed. The plaintiffs' first clear\narticulation of the right came in opposition to the State's summary judgment motion on the substantive due\nprocess claims:\nThe first [substantive due process] claim alleges that child abuse and neglect victims placed in the\nstate's custody are entitled to be free from harm and that such harm encompasses both physical\ninjury and mental and/or psychological harm. The injury of which plaintiff's [sic] complain is caused\nprimarily by defendants' pattern and practice of indiscriminately moving children from one\nplacement to another like so much chattel. The second claim asserts that foster children must be\nprovided with health care while in state custody and that their entitlement to such treatment\nincludes a right to care for their serious mental health problems.\n\nCP at 2256-57 (Pls.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss Substantive Due Process Claims) (emphasis added)\n(footnotes omitted). At that point, it appears that the State and the trial court both understood the class's theory\nwas that substantive due process prohibited frequent placement changes. See, e.g., RP at 3073-74.\nIn court before the jury on October 29, 2001, the plaintiffs argued \"the right of children to a safe, stable and\npermanent home and the constitutional right to be free from harm.\" RP at 775. The trial court and the State both\nbelieved that was a correct description of the class's substantive due process theory. See, e.g., RP at 3072-740.\nWhen all the evidence was in and both sides had rested, the plaintiffs informed the court they had concluded it\nwould be error to instruct on the constitutional right to \"safe, stable, and permanent homes.\" RP at 3072. Instead,\nthe plaintiffs suggested instructing on the right to \"adequate treatment ... substantially comporting to professional\n856 standards.\" Id. (citing Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 *856 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982)). Both\nthe State and the court expressed surprise. The court said, \"I have had in my mind all along that [the right to safe,\nstable, and permanent homes] is what we have been talking about.\" RP at 3073. The State excepted to the\ninstruction, arguing \"Youngberg ... is the burden ... not... the right.\" RP at 3079. The trial court substantially\nadopted the plaintiffs' position and issued its final jury instructions, defining the liberty interest as follows:\nThe plaintiff class claims that the defendants violated, or will violate, their constitutional rights to\nsubstantive due process to be treated in a manner which does not substantially depart from\nprofessional judgment, standards or practice.\nCP at 751 (Jury Instruction 7). The jury was ultimately asked to render a verdict on two questions: whether the\nconstitutional rights of the plaintiff class were violated, and, if so, whether the violation was the proximate cause\nof the harm claimed by the class. After a day of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs. Id. Later,\nthe trial court made five additional findings of fact:\n1. Children are harmed by being subjected to unnecessary multiple placements.\n2. Foster parents are inadequately trained, informed and supported to provide proper care for\nchildren in the class.\n3. Children are denied necessary mental health care (assessments and treatment).\n4. Children are placed in unsafe placements (DSHS offices, homes of sexual offenders, violent\noffenders and held in detention/jails).\n5. Children are separated from their siblings.\nCP at 143.\nBased on the jury's verdict and the additional findings, the trial court entered a broad injunction, mandating the\nrecruitment of new foster parents, notification prior to placement changes, arrangements to improve education,\nadditional training and institutional support of foster parents, and increased emphasis on the preservation of\nsibling relationships. The court further ordered DSHS to desist immediately from holding foster children in unsafe\nplacements. The court ordered plaintiffs' counsel to monitor compliance and retained jurisdiction until satisfied\nthat \"there is no reasonable possibility of recurrence of the unconstitutional conditions identified.\" CP at 153.\nDSHS estimates that implementation of the injunction would cost $60,408,400. App. to Br. of Appellants, A-41.\nThe State appealed and moved for an emergency stay of the injunction. The Court of Appeals stayed\nimplementation of most of the injunction, leaving in place some orders relating to unsafe placements, and\ncertified the appeal to this court. We accepted review.\nANALYSIS\nI. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS\n\nA. The Right\nFirst, we must decide whether foster children possess substantive due process rights that the State, in its\nexercise of executive authority, is bound to respect. We hold that they do.\nIn this, we do no more than follow the weight of authority among our sister courts. See, e.g., Roska v. Peterson,\n304 F.3d 982, 994 (10th Cir.2002); Charlie H. v.

Walker v.\nLedbetter, 818 F.2d 791, 795 (11th Cir.1987) (declaring that like the plaintiff in Youngberg, foster children are\n\"involuntarily placed ... in a custodial environment, and... unable to seek alternative living arrangements.\"); Doe v.\nN.Y.

DeShaney v. Winnebago\nCounty Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 201, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989).\nWe must harmonize these positive articulations of constitutionally protected rights of foster children with the fact\nthat \"the Constitution does not guarantee due care on the part of state officials; liability for negligently inflicted\nharm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.\" County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523\nU.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998).\nModern substantive due process jurisprudence requires a \"`careful description' of the asserted fundamental\nliberty interest.\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997). We\nconclude that at its core, foster children have a substantive due process right to be free from unreasonable risk of\nharm, including a risk flowing from the lack of basic services, and a right to reasonable safety. Roska, 304 F.3d at\n[4]\n994 ; see also K.H., 914 F.2d at 852 (due process right \"not to be handed over by state officers to a foster\nparent or other custodian, private or public, whom the state knows or suspects to be a child abuser.\"); Kara B. v.\nDane County, 205 Wis.2d 140, 152, 555 N.W.2d 630 (1996) (right to a \"reasonably safe and secure placement\"); \nMeador v. Cabinet for Human Res., 902 F.2d 474, 476 (6th Cir.1990) (substantive due process right to be free\nfrom unreasonable harm); cf. BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1336, 398-99 (7th ed.1999) (defining \"safe\" and\n\"danger\"); but cf. Mark G. v. Sabol, 93 N.Y.2d 710, 726, 717 N.E.2d 1067, 695 N.Y.S.2d 730 (1999) (no\nsubstantive due process right to family social services before placement or during placements). Exposure of the\nchild to an unreasonable risk of harm violates the substantive due process clause. \"Harm\" is to be given its\nordinary meaning of physical or mental damage. WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY\n1034 (1993); cf. BLACK'S, supra, at 722.\nThe State has given us no compelling reason to part company with our brethren courts, and we accordingly\nrecognize and adhere to the weight of authority that foster children have substantive due process rights the State\nis bound to respect. We hold that foster children have a constitutional substantive due process right to be free\nfrom unreasonable risks of harm and a right to reasonable safety. To be reasonably safe, the State, as custodian\nand caretaker of foster children must provide conditions free of unreasonable risk of danger, harm, or pain, and\nmust include adequate services to meet the basic needs of the child.\n\nB. Culpability Standard\nNext, we must decide the appropriate culpability standard for measuring alleged violations of the substantive due\nprocess rights of foster children. The United States Supreme Court has articulated two standards that have been\napplied by lower courts: deliberate indifference and professional judgment. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708,\n140 L.Ed.2d 1043; Youngberg, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28; see generally Matthew D. Umhofer,\nConfusing Pursuits: Sacramento v. Lewis and the Future of Substantive Due Process in the Executive Setting, 41\n858 SANTA CLARA L.REV. *858 437 (2001). Something more than negligence is required. Ultimately, substantive\ndue process is violated if the executive action shocks the court's conscience; both standards are tailored to assist\ncourts in evaluating executive action in specific factual contexts. E.g., Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n. 8, 118 S.Ct. 1708\n.\nDSHS argues that plaintiffs are required to show that the State's conduct either shocks the conscience or was\ndeliberately indifferent to their rights. It asks for remand for reconsideration under one of those standards. The\nclass argues that the trial judge was correct and the professional judgment standard is appropriate. Under the\nprofessional judgment standard, plaintiffs must prove that the action was such a \"substantial departure from\naccepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually\ndid not base the decision on such a judgment.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. 2452.\nNo contemporary court has attempted to determine whether state conduct toward those in the State's custody is\nconstitutionally \"conscience shocking\" without recourse to either the deliberative indifference standard or the\nexercise of professional judgment standard. We conclude that the proper inquiry is whether the State's conduct\nfalls substantially short of the exercise of professional judgment, standards, or practices. See Brian A. v.\n[5]\nSundquist, 149 F.Supp.2d 941, 953-54 (M.D.Tenn.2000) ; Jordan, 66 F.Supp.2d at 646 (extending professional\njudgment standard to foster children); Charlie H., 83 F.Supp.2d at 507 (same); cf. 53 AM.JUR.2D Mentally\nImpaired Persons § 103, at 555 (1996). However, we will briefly survey the arguments for both approaches.\nFirst, we consider the State's contention that Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043, governs. \nLewis considered the substantive due process implications of a police chase that ended in the death of a\nmotorcycle passenger. The Supreme Court found a colorable claim, but found no substantive due process\nviolation because the officer's conduct was not so egregious as to be constitutionally conscience shocking. Id. at\n847, 118 S.Ct. 1708. Lewis held that the appropriate standard to be applied would depend in part on history,\ncontemporary practice, due respect for the executive, and the general standards of blame. Lewis, 523 U.S. at\n847 n. 8, 118 S.Ct. 1708.\nApplying similar principles, federal appellate courts have consistently held that conduct deliberately indifferent to\nthe substantive due process rights of detainees violates the constitution. See, e.g., Roska, 304 F.3d at 994; Nicini\nv. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 811 (3d Cir.2000); Kitzman-Kelley v. Warner, 203 F.3d 454, 458 (7th Cir.2000); White v.\nChambliss, 112 F.3d 731, 737 (4th Cir.1997); Meador, 902 F.2d at 476; Taylor v. Ledbetter, 818 F.2d 791, 796\n(11th Cir.1987); Doe, 649 F.2d at 141. Put another way, the \"deliberate indifference\" standard is the minimum\nstandard of care required to meet the State's substantive due process duties toward those it has placed in its\ncustody.\nMore relevant to the case at bar, many courts applying these principles have concluded that the deliberate\nindifference test is not well calibrated to the substantive due process claims of foster children. We find compelling\nthe reasons advanced by these courts.\nFirst, the federal cases that have applied the \"deliberate indifference\" standard to the substantive due process\nrights of foster children have been in the context of the limited question of whether individual state actors were\n859 entitled to qualified immunity in a 42 *859 U.S.C. § 1983 suit. Whether and when qualified immunity is available\nto state actors triggers a consideration of issues not before us.\nSecondly, and more importantly, we note that none of the appellate courts cited by the State held that \"deliberate\nindifference\" was the appropriate standard. Instead, those courts applied the standard presented to them by the\n\nparties. Several of the federal courts explicitly qualified that they were not deciding the standard for injunctive\nrelief, or that they had not been asked to consider a professional judgment standard. See, e.g., Nicini, 212 F.3d at\n811 n. 9; K.H., 914 F.2d at 854. And in fact, outside of the § 1983 context, the culpability standard has been more\nprecisely calibrated in cases involving foster children. See, e.g., Kara B., 205 Wis.2d at 158, 555 N.W.2d 630; cf. \nLewis, 523 U.S. at 834, 847 n. 8, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (appropriate standard will vary by context).\nFinally, we note that most cases that have specifically addressed the issue have applied the professional\njudgment standard. Kara B., 205 Wis.2d at 158, 555 N.W.2d 630; LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F.Supp. 959, 996\n(D.D.C.1991); accord Neiberger v. Hawkins, 239 F.Supp.2d 1140, 1149 (D.Colo.2002).\nAccordingly, we hold that \"deliberate indifference\" is not well suited for analyzing the claims of the class. Foster\nchildren are entitled to a high standard. Accord Brian A., 149 F.Supp.2d at 953-54. Something more than\nrefraining from indifferent action is required to protect these innocents.\nThe plaintiffs argue for the professional judgment standard of Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. 2452. That\nwould allow them to present proof that the decisions they complain of, while not deliberately indifferent to their\nsubstantive due process rights, were not the product of professional judgment. We find compelling the reasoning\nof the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which found \"that those entrusted with the task of ensuring that children are\nplaced in a safe and secure foster home owe a constitutional duty that is determined by a professional judgment\nstandard.\" Kara B., 205 Wis.2d at 158, 555 N.W.2d 630 (emphasis added). We agree. Foster children, because\nof circumstances usually far beyond their control, have been removed from their parents by the State for the\nchild's own best interest. More often these children are victims, not perpetrators. Foster children need both care\nand protection. The State owes these children more than benign indifference and must affirmatively take\nreasonable steps to provide for their care and safety. See, e.g., Sundquist, 149 F.Supp.2d at 953-54. As one\ncourt noted:\nThe foster children that make up the plaintiff class in this case have done society no wrong and ...\n[i]t would be inappropriate to force them to endure constitutional deprivations absent a showing of\n\"deliberate indifference\" by their caretakers. At the same time, it would be inappropriate to hold\ncaretakers liable for constitutional deprivations when those caretakers had exercised their\nprofessional judgment in determining the best course of conduct.\nLaShawn A., 762 F.Supp. at 996; accord In re Det. of J.S., 124 Wash.2d 689, 700, 880 P.2d 976 (1994) (applying\nthe professional judgment standard to alleged deprivations of substantive due process rights in the mental health\nsetting); Sundquist, 149 F.Supp.2d at 953-54. We concur.\nWe note that mechanical application of this test, however, is impracticable, and has been rejected by the United\nStates Supreme Court. The test for whether a particular action shocks the conscience must be appropriately\ntailored to the factual context at hand and \"must be determined by balancing... liberty interests against the\nrelevant state interests.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321, 102 S.Ct. 2452. In order to preserve \"constitutional\nproportions of substantive due process,\" a court must undertake \"an exact analysis of circumstances before any\nabuse of power is condemned as conscience shocking.\" Lewis, 523 U.S. at 850, 118 S.Ct. 1708. This standard\nbest allows for such a nuanced inquiry.\nWe hold that the appropriate culpability standard is the professional judgment standard, i.e., the exercise of\n860 professional judgment made in accord with accepted professional standards or practice. The State, as *860 the\ncustodian and caretaker of these children, is therefore liable for the harm allegedly caused by a violation of a\nfoster child's substantive due process right to be free from unreasonable risk of harm and to reasonable safety\nonly when his or her care, treatment, and services \"substantially depart from accepted professional judgment,\nstandards or practice.\"\nII. THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS\nWe must now determine whether the jury instructions incorrectly stated the law by mistaking the right for the\nculpability standard, and, if so, whether reversal is warranted. The relevant jury instructions state:\n\nThe plaintiff class claims that the defendants violated, or will violate, their constitutional rights to\nsubstantive due process to be treated in a manner which does not substantially depart from\nprofessional judgment, standards or practice.\nCP at 751 (Jury Instruction 7).\nTo establish a claim under the United States Constitution, the plaintiff class must prove ...\nFirst, that the defendants persistently and substantially departed from the exercise of professional\njudgment, standards or practice by engaging in a widespread pattern or practice of depriving the\nplaintiff class of the rights secured by the Constitution of the United States to be treated in a\nmanner which does not substantially depart from professional judgment, standards or practice.\nCP at 752 (Jury Instruction 8). The verdict form asked the jury to decide two questions:\nQuestion No. 1: Were the constitutional rights of the plaintiff class violated?\nAnswer: X yes ___ No\n. . .\nQuestion No. 2: Was such violation a proximate cause of the harm to the plaintiff class in one or\nmore ways claimed by plaintiffs?\nAnswer: X yes ___ No\nCP at 759. Effectively, the jury was instructed that the substantive due process clause created a right to treatment\n\"which does not substantially depart from professional judgment, standards or practice\" to be measured against\nwhether the State \"persistently and substantially departed from the exercise of professional judgment, standards\nor practice.\" The jury was incorrectly instructed because the instructions confounded the substantive due process\nright with the standard of culpability to be applied.\nWe do not find the error harmless. Properly, the jury should have been asked first to determine whether specific\ndecisions of DSHS violated the foster children's right to be free from unreasonable risk of harm or violated their\nright to reasonable safety. Second, the jury should have been asked if the plaintiffs had established that the\ndecisions substantially departed from accepted professional judgment, standards, or practice. If the decisions did\nnot substantially depart from accepted professional judgment, standards, or practice, then the substantive due\nprocess clause was not offended, even if harm resulted to an individual child. Cf. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct.\n1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (death of a motorcycle passenger not a substantive due process violation under the\ncircumstances). Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 719-21, 117 S.Ct. 2258. We therefore reverse and remand for further\n[6]\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIII. EVIDENCE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, STANDARDS, OR\nPRACTICE\nSome of the remaining contentions will undoubtedly resurface on remand. Therefore, we will address them\nbriefly. Cf. Carrick v. Locke, 125 Wash.2d 129, 140, 882 P.2d 173 (1994). Both the class and the State argue that\nthe trial court committed evidentiary errors. Claimed evidentiary error is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Davis v.\nGlobe Mach. Mfg. Co., 102 Wash.2d 68, 76, 684 P.2d 692 (1984). Discretion is abused when the \"exercise of\n861 discretion is manifestly unreasonable or based upon untenable *861 grounds or reasons.\" Davis, 102 Wash.2d at\n77, 684 P.2d 692 (citing State ex rel. Carroll v. Junker, 79 Wash.2d 12, 482 P.2d 775 (1971)).\nAll evidence at issue was offered by one side or the other to establish the appropriate professional standard to\nmeasure DSHS's conduct.\n\nA. Was Evidence from Other States Properly Excluded?\nEvidence of standards, practices, and comparisons with other states was excluded. We affirm in part and reverse\nin part.\nThe State offered statistical data tending to show that Washington meets or exceeds the standards in other\nstates. We find no abuse in discretion in excluding any evidence that was merely statistical or demographic.\nHowever, we hold that evidence of actual professional standards followed by other states is properly admissible\non remand. We find compelling United States Supreme Court precedent. In a substantive due process challenge\nto a New York statute that allowed pretrial detention of juveniles considered a \"flight risk,\" the Court specifically\nfound that standards and practices in other states were relevant to the standard of care required by the\nsubstantive due process clause. Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 268, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984).\n\"`The fact that a practice is followed by a large number of states is not conclusive in a decision as to whether that\npractice accords with due process, but it is plainly worth considering in determining whether the practice `offends\nsome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as\nfundamental.''\" Schall, 467 U.S. at 268, 104 S.Ct. 2403 (finding no substantive due process violation) (quoting \nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934),overruled on other grounds by \nMalloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 5, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964)).\nThe class argues that the standards in other states are irrelevant and properly excluded because, they claim,\nother states' practices fall beneath the constitutional standard, and therefore the trial would have been prolonged\nunnecessarily by discussion of whether the other states met constitutional standards. However, the United States\nSupreme Court has clearly held that the standards and practices in other states are relevant to the standard of\ncare required by the substantive due process clause. Schall, 467 U.S. at 268, 104 S.Ct. 2403. Given that, it is\nclearly relevant. The class may, of course, attempt to prove that these practices fall below the constitutionally\nrequired standard of care.\nB. Was Evidence of Aspirational Standards Properly Admitted?\nThe trial court admitted evidence of aspirational standards for foster care promulgated by the Child Welfare\n[7]\nLeague of America and the American Academy of Pediatrics.  The State contends that aspirational standards\nare not relevant to whether constitutionally mandated standards have been met under Youngberg, 457 U.S. at\n324, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (discussing the right to adequate treatment substantially conforming to professional\nstandards). We agree that mere aspirational goals are not evidence of accepted professional judgment, practice,\nor standards. E.g., United States v. Com. of Pennsylvania, 902 F.Supp. 565, 584 (W.D.Pa. 1995) (\"Optimal\ncourses of treatment as determined by some expert, while laudable, do not establish the minimal constitutional\nstandard.\"); see also Wendy H. v. Philadelphia, 849 F.Supp. 367, 372 (E.D.Pa.1994). We conclude that, based\nupon the record before us, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to admit these aspirational standards.\nC. Was Evidence of Past DSHS Conduct Properly Admitted?\nDSHS claims that evidence of abandoned practices was improperly admitted to prove prior conditions. Injunctive\n862 relief is prospective and requires evidence of *862 current violations. Rumbolz v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1, 22\nWash.2d 724, 734, 157 P.2d 927 (1945) (\"It is a familiar principle that the remedy is only available where the\ninjury is... existing or presently threatened.\"). Evidence of past occurrences is relevant to injunctive relief only\ninsofar as it tends to show an ongoing or future likelihood of harm.\nAn injunction is inappropriate if it is absolutely clear that behavior will not recur, but courts must \"beware of efforts\nto defeat injunctive relief by protestations of reform.\" State v. Ralph Williams' N.W. Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 87\nWash.2d 298, 312, 553 P.2d 423 (1976). As the United States Supreme Court noted:\n\nIt is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a\nfederal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice. Such abandonment is an\nimportant factor bearing on the question whether a court should exercise its power to enjoin the\ndefendant from renewing the practice, but that is a matter relating to the exercise rather than the\nexistence of judicial power. In this case the city's repeal of the objectionable language would not\npreclude it from reenacting precisely the same provision if the District Court's judgment were\nvacated. The city followed that course with respect to the age restriction, which was first reduced\nfor Aladdin from 17 to 7 and then, in obvious response to the state court's judgment, the\nexemption was eliminated. There is no certainty that a similar course would not be pursued if its\nmost recent amendment were effective to defeat federal jurisdiction.\nCity of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982) (footnotes\nomitted). We agree. The State has not shown abuse of discretion in permitting evidence of past practices, given\nthe distinct possibility that such practices could occur again.\nD. Was Evidence from the Ombudsman Properly Admitted?\nThe court admitted, over the State's objection, the annual report of the Office of the Family and Child\nOmbudsman. DSHS argues that admittance was precluded by statute, and use of the report for the truth of the\nanonymous facts presented was hearsay. We agree that the ombudsman's report should have been excluded.\nThe legislature created the Office of the Family and Child Ombudsman \"for the purpose of ... identifying system\nissues and responses for the governor and the legislature to act upon, and monitoring and ensuring compliance\"\nwith law, regulations and policies promulgated to protect children and families. RCW 43.06A.010. Information\ncollected by the ombudsman is confidential and exempt from discovery:\nNeither the ombudsman nor the ombudsman's staff may be compelled, in any judicial or\nadministrative proceeding, to testify or to produce evidence regarding the exercise of the official\nduties of the ombudsman or of the ombudsman's staff. All related memoranda, work product,\nnotes, and case files of the ombudsman's office are confidential, are not subject to discovery,\njudicial or administrative subpoena, or other method of legal compulsion, and are not admissible in\nevidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding. This section shall not apply to the legislative\noversight committee.\nRCW 43.06A.060. RCW 43.06A.080 has four exclusions. It allows the ombudsman to report crimes, threats of\nimminent serious harm, general information regarding the operation of the ombudsman's office, and failures of\nthose required to report child abuse under RCW 26.44.030. It does not allow the annual report to be admitted into\nevidence. Further, the class relied heavily on the report to prove past occurrences, which deprived DSHS of the\nability to challenge the underlying facts. It was an error of law to admit the report.\nE. Was Evidence of Fiscal Constraints Properly Excluded?\nThe trial court partially excluded evidence of fiscal constraint and lack of funding as a defense to the claim that\nthe class's constitutional rights were violated. Lack of funds does not excuse a violation of the constitution and\n863 this court can order expenditures, *863 if necessary, to enforce constitutional mandates. Hillis v. Dep't of Ecology,\n131 Wash.2d 373, 389, 932 P.2d 139 (1997).\nThe State, relying on In re Detention of J.S., 124 Wash.2d 689, 880 P.2d 976, argues that testimony of budget\nconstraints should have been admitted to show compliance with the relevant standard. The State misreads J.S.\nJ.S. merely holds that, above a constitutional threshold, cost is relevant to whether professional judgment has\nbeen exercised. But J.S. does not stand for the proposition that cost defeats a claim to constitutionally adequate\ntreatment. \"Thus, the constitutionally significant issue is not whether the optimal course of treatment must be\nfollowed, but whether a course of treatment is adequate and reasonably based on professional judgment.\" Id. at\n700, 880 P.2d 976. The trial court below properly followed J.S. and did not permit the State to advance lack of\n\nfunds as a defense but did permit the State to offer testimony about how a lack of resources \"affects the State's\nexercise of professional judgment in a particular activity.\" CP at 847. The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\nIV. ENFORCEABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS\nThe trial court dismissed all of the class's statutory claims. This is reviewed de novo. Kent Farms, Inc. v. Zurich\nIns. Co., 140 Wash.2d 396, 399, 998 P.2d 292 (2000).\nA. Washington State Statutes\nWe affirm the trial court's dismissal of claims based on RCW 74.14A.050(2), (3), RCW 74.13.250 and .280. None\nof these statutes explicitly create a private cause of action. The issue is whether a private cause of action is\nimplied. This court has adopted a three part test to determine whether a statute impliedly creates a cause of\naction: \"first, whether the plaintiff is within the class for whose `especial' benefit the statute was enacted; second,\nwhether legislative intent, explicitly or implicitly, supports creating or denying a remedy; and third, whether\nimplying a remedy is consistent with the underlying purpose of the legislation.\" Bennett v. Hardy, 113 Wash.2d\n912, 920-21, 784 P.2d 1258 (1990). This test has also been applied to determine whether injunctive relief is\navailable. See, e.g., Wash. State Coalition for the Homeless v. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs., 133 Wash.2d 894,\n912, 949 P.2d 1291 (1997).\nWe find that all of these statutes are for the especial benefit of foster children. However, we find no evidence of\nlegislative intent to create a private cause of action, and that implying one is inconsistent with the broad power\nvested in DSHS to administer these statutes. We note that parties believing themselves aggrieved by DSHS's\nfailure to abide by these statutes, including a foster child through an attorney or guardian ad litem, will have an\nopportunity to raise the issue in the context of dependency actions. See, e.g., RCW 13.34.120, .130; cf Wilmot v.\nKaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 118 Wash.2d 46, 61, 821 P.2d 18 (1991) (finding relevant, but not conclusive,\nthe existence of other remedies). The trial court's dismissal of claims based on these statutes is affirmed.\nB. Federal Statutes\nWe also affirm the trial court's dismissal of claims based on 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16) and 675(1) of the Federal\nChild Welfare Act (CWA).\nThe CWA, enacted pursuant to Congress's spending clause authority, allows states to apply for federal funds to\nsupport their health and human services programs, so long as they meet certain federal standards. Suter v. Artist\nM., 503 U.S. 347, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992). There is no explicit cause of action in the CWA; we\nrecognize that courts around the country are divided on whether a cause of action is implied or maintainable\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Compare Suter, 503 U.S. 347, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (finding no implied cause\nof action in 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15)) with Occean v. Kearney, 123 F.Supp.2d 618, 625 (S.D.Fla. 2000) (finding\nprivately enforceable right implied in 42 U.S.C. § 675(a)(16)); see generally Actions under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 for\nViolations of Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, 93 A.L.R. FED. 314 (1989).\nThe relevant portion of the CWA reads:\n864 *864 State plan for foster care and adoption assistance\n(a) Requisite features of State plan\nIn order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan approved by the\nSecretary which 00\n97\n. . . .\n(16) provides for the development of a case plan (as defined in section 675(1) of this title) for each\nchild receiving foster care maintenance payments under the State plan and provides for a case\n\nreview system which meets the requirements described in section 675(5)(B) of this title with\nrespect to each such child.\n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16). Section 675(1) states:\nAs used in this part or part B of this subchapter:\n(1) The term \"case plan\" means a written document which includes at least the following:\n(A) A description of the type of home or institution in which a child is to be placed, including a\ndiscussion of the safety and appropriateness of the placement and how the agency which is\nresponsible for the child plans to carry out the voluntary placement agreement entered into or\njudicial determination made with respect to the child in accordance with section 672(a)(1) of this\ntitle.\n(B) A plan for assuring that the child receives safe and proper care and that services are provided\nto the parents, child, and foster parents in order to improve the conditions in the parents' home,\nfacilitate return of the child to his own safe home or the permanent placement of the child, and\naddress the needs of the child while in foster care, including a discussion of the appropriateness\nof the services that have been provided to the child under the plan.\n(C) To the extent available and accessible, the health and education records of the child, including\n00\n97\n(i) the names and addresses of the child's health and educational providers;\n(ii) the child's grade level performance;\n(iii) the child's school record;\n(iv) assurances that the child's placement in foster care takes into account proximity to the school\nin which the child is enrolled at the time of placement;\n(v) a record of the child's immunizations;\n(vi) the child's known medical problems;\n(vii) the child's medications; and\n(viii) any other relevant health and education information concerning the child determined to be\nappropriate by the State agency.\n(D) Where appropriate, for a child age 16 or over, a written description of the programs and\nservices which will help such child prepare for the transition from foster care to independent living.\n(E) In the case of a child with respect to whom the permanency plan is adoption or placement in\nanother permanent home, documentation of the steps the agency is taking to find an adoptive\nfamily or other permanent living arrangement for the child, to place the child with an adoptive\nfamily, a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or in another planned permanent living\narrangement, and to finalize the adoption or legal guardianship. At a minimum, such\ndocumentation shall include child specific recruitment efforts such as the use of State, regional,\nand national adoption exchanges including electronic exchange systems.\n865 A detailed inquiry is not required.[8] Spending clause legislation must *865 contain specific \"rights creating\"\nlanguage before a court can find an implied cause of action or right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See \nGonzaga v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 2275, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002). The Supreme Court has recently\nbeen highly suspicious of contentions that various federal administrative or funding schemes create enforceable\nclaims of right. See, e.g., id; Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 288, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 1520, 149 L.Ed.2d 517\n\n(2001) (§ 602 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not create enforceable right to be free of\nunintentional discrimination). We do not find such rights creating language here.\nWe therefore hold that 42 U.S.C §§ 671(a)(16) and 675(1) do not create an enforceable right to injunctive relief.\nV. OTHER ISSUES\nDSHS argues that the original class was improperly certified, and that the trial court improperly denied its posttrial\nmotion to revise the class, and that the injunction entered was too broad. Given our disposition, we vacate the\ninjunction in its entirety, and decline to reach issues regarding class certification. The parties are free on remand\nto make additional motions to modify the class consistent with this opinion. We do not reach whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in declining to add DSHS Secretary Dennis Braddock as a party. On remand, the class\nmay move to add Secretary Braddock as a party, and we leave it to the able hands of the trial judge to determine\nif it is appropriate. We do not reach whether judicial estoppel is appropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nWe therefore hold that foster children have substantive due process rights to be free of unreasonable risk of\nharm, and a right to reasonable safety. Alleged violations of that right will be measured on the professional\njudgment standard as articulated in Youngberg, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28, and its progeny.\nWe find that the jury instructions did not correctly articulate the right and the standard, and that the error was not\nharmless. We further hold that trial court erred by admitting the ombudsman's report and evidence of national\naspirational standards. We affirm in part and reverse in part the admittance of standards in other states. The trial\ncourt did not err in its judgment on the use of fiscal constraints or by admitting evidence of past DSHS conduct.\nWe hold that RCW 74.14A.050(2) and (3), and RCW 74.13.250, and .280 do not create a private cause of action.\nWe affirm the trial court that 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1) are not privately enforceable. We do not reach\nquestions surrounding class certification, the scope of the injunction, or substitution of parties. Attorney fees are\ndenied.\nWe therefore vacate the injunction and the verdict, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\nALEXANDER, C.J., JOHNSON, MADSEN, SANDERS, IRELAND, BRIDGE, OWENS, JJ., and THOMPSON, J.\nPro Tem., concur.\n[1] Reactive attachment disorder is associated with grossly inadequate care or a failure to form attachments to\ncaregivers, and can be debilitating. See Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders: DSM IV-TR 127-30 (4th ed.2000).\n[2]See, e.g., Brian A. v. Sundquist, 149 F.Supp.2d 941, 944 (M.D.Tenn.2000); LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F.Supp.\n959, 996 (D.D.C.1991); See also Roberta Nestaas & Steve Wickmark, Appealing Jury Verdict Against DSHS Will\nDelay Getting Help To Kids In Need, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Jan. 20, 2002. At oral argument, counsel for the\nState indicated that he knew of at least 17 similar cases brought in other states, most of which had ended in\nconsent decrees and are unavailable to this court to guide our analysis.\n[3] A jury trial for equitable relief is permitted by CR 39(c) (\"In all actions not triable of right by a jury the court ...\nmay, with the consent of both parties, order a trial with a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if trial by jury\nhad been a matter of right.\").\n[4] We caution that this broad substantive due process right is not a back door for constitutionalizing all tort\nclaims, as the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly warned against. Nor does it create a right to services\nnot reasonably necessary in protecting the child from harm.\n[5] Illustrative is this treatise on a related area of law: \n\nIn determining whether a state has adequately protected an involuntarily committed person's constitutional liberty\ninterests in reasonable care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement conditions. and such training as\nmay be required by these interests, decisions made by an appropriate professional as to what is reasonable are\nentitled to presumption of correctness and validity, and liability may be imposed only when the professional's\ndecision is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to\ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\n53 AM.JUR.2D Mentally Impaired Persons § 103, at 555 (1996) (footnote omitted).\n[6] We note that the parties agreed below to be bound by a jury. Because relief at this point is solely equitable,\nthe parties are not entitled to a jury trial. Brown v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 94 Wash.2d 359, 365, 617 P.2d 704\n(1980).\n[7] Evidence of standards promulgated by the Counsel on Accreditation (COA) were admitted at trial. DSHS does\nnot challenge these standards on appeal.\n[8] Under federal law, whether a statute creates a private cause of action is mostly dependent on three factors:\n(1) whether the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute, (2) whether the plaintiff's asserted interests are\nnot so vague and amorphous as to give ascertainable standards to the judiciary, and (3) whether the statute\nimposes a binding obligation on the state. Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-41, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137\nL.Ed.2d 569 (1997). Since we decide this matter consonant with the threshold factor established in Gonzaga v.\nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 2275, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002), we do not specifically address these factors.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "BRAAM v. STATE OF WASHINGTON \nREVISED SETTLEMENT AND EXIT AGREEMENT \nI.  PREAMBLE \nThis Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement (herein called \"this Agreement\") extends and \nmodifies the original Settlement Agreement, which was entered into between the Department of \nSocial and Health Services (DSHS or Department) and counsel for the Braam Plaintiffs \n(Plaintiffs) on July 31, 2004.  The original Settlement Agreement was scheduled to terminate \nJuly 31, 2011, and was extended by agreement of the parties through October 31,2011.  This \nAgreement shall be effective on November 1,2011. \nThe parties agree that, in a number of areas, significant progress and improvements to \nWashington's child welfare system have been made since 2004.  This progress is attributable, in \nlarge part, to the commitment of DSHS staff to improve the system; the Governor and the \nLegislature in providing direction and resources to maintain and improve the child welfare \nsystem; the leadership ofDSHS and Children's Administration (CA) for accountability, \ntransparency, and improving the safety and welfare of children in the care ofDSHS; and \ncommunity stakeholders, including Plaintiffs' counsel, as advocates for necessary change. \nII.  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE \nIn agreeing to extend the time for achieving the goals of the original 2004 Settlement Agreement, \nthe parties acknowledge the following: \n1.  The original Settlement Agreement was entered into in 2004, between DSHS and counsel \nfor the class of children in out-of-home placement in the care and custody of CA that was \ncertified in the lawsuit then pending in Whatcom County Superior Court, Braam v. State \na/Washington, No. 98-2-01570-1, to resolve issues identified in the case and provide for \nsystemic improvements to the delivery of child welfare services to children in the class .. \n2.  The original Settlement Agreement established an Oversight Panel, composed of experts \nin child welfare, to develop measurable outcomes with specific annual benchmarks to . \nachieve the overall Goals identified by the parties in the Agreement.  The Oversight \nPanel was also charged with monitoring the Department's compliance and making \nfindings with regard to the outcomes, benchmarks and related action steps, developing \nProfessional Standards, and providing advice and technical assistance to DSHS. \n3.  Despite the Department's significant progress in a number of areas covered by the 2004 \nAgreement, the parties acknowledge that the Department has not yet met a number of key \noutcomes.  The parties further acknowledge that new challenges to Washington's child \nwelfare system have been created by the current challenging economic climate.  The \nPlaintiffs have identified concerns regarding the possible effects of cuts in funding for \nchild welfare and related services and the need to adopt the reforms made to date under \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31,2011 \n\nthe Settlement Agreement into new models for the delivery of child welfare services \nrequired by the enactment of2SHB 2106 in 2009.  The parties agree that the goals stated \nin Section III below reflect sound child welfare principles and practice and are consistent \nwith the child welfare transformation design process currently under development by the \nDepartment.  In order to work to achieve the remaining enforceable outcomes, to provide \nfor a period of continued external monitoring, and to provide reasonable assurances that \nthe progress made to date will be sustained in the future, the parties agree to extend and \nmodify the 2004 Settlement Agreement as provided herein. \nIII.  RESTATEMENT OF GOALS \nThe parties restate and reaffirm the Goals of the 2004 Settlement Agreement as follows: \n1.  Each child in the custody of the Department shall have a safe and stable placement with a \ncaregiver capable of meeting the child's needs. \n2.  The children in the custody of the Department shall have an initial physical and mental \nhealth screening within 30 days of entry into care. \n3.  Children in the custody of the Department shall receive timely, accessible, individualized \nand appropriate mental health assessments and treatment by qualified mental health \nprofessionals consistent with the child's best interest. \n4.  Caregivers shall be adequately trained, supported, and informed about children for whom \nthey provide care so that the caregivers are capable of meeting their responsibilities for \nproviding for the children in their care. \n5.  Siblings shall be placed together, unless the health, safety, or welfare of a child is put in \njeopardy by the placement. \n6.  Siblings in foster care who are not placed together and those who remain at home shall \nhave frequent and meaningful contact, unless such visitation is not in the best interest of \nthe children. \n7.  The Department shall improve the continuity and consistency of education for children in \nthe custody of the Department. \n8.  The Department shall improve the quality and accessibility of services to adolescents in \nthe custody of the Department to better prepare them to live independently. \n9.  The Department shall reduce the number of adolescents who run away while in foster \ncare. \n2 \nBraam v. State of Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31,2011 \n\nAs a means of achieving these Goals and maintaining the systemic improvements made to the \nState's child welfare system for children in out-of-home care in the custody of the Children's \nAdministration ofDSHS, the parties agree as follows: \nIV.  DEFINITIONS \n1.  \"Plaintiff Class\" means all children in the custody of DSHS who are now placed or in the \nfuture will be placed by DSHS in three or more placements and those children in the \ncustody of DSHS who are at risk of three or more placements. \n2.  A child \"in the custody of DSHS\" means a child whose custody has been placed with \nDSHS by court order in a dependency or termination action under RCW Chapter 13.34 or \nby a voluntary placement agreement between DSHS and the child's parent or guardian. \nA child \"in the custody ofDSHS\" includes a child in DSHS custody placed with an \nunlicensed relative or other suitable person. \n3.  \"Placement\" means any home or facility, whether public or private, in which the child is \nplaced by DSHS while in the custody of DSHS regardless of the length of time the child \nremains in that home or facility.  Respite care and short-term interruptions such as \nhospital stays shall not be included.  Placement means any home and/or facility the State \nis mandated to include under its reporting responsibilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §679, 45 \nC.F.R. 1355.407, Appendices A & B, and the Child Welfare Policy Manual. \n4.  \"Juvenile court\" means the Juvenile Division of Washington State Superior Court, \npresiding over a dependency proceeding pursuant to RCW Chapter 13.34. \n5.  \"Outcome\" means a specific and measurable result consistent with the Professional \nStandards developed by the Oversight Panel and agreed to by the parties and set forth in \nSection VI below that is intended to promote systemic improvement in the delivery of \nchild welfare services by DSHS to the children in the Plaintiff Class. \n6.  \"Full compliance measure\" means the level of performance required for the Department \nto meet a specific outcome during the reporting period designated for that outcome in \nSection VI below.  Unless otherwise specified in Section VI below, full compliance \nrequires that the Department meet the level of performance on a statewide basis and that \nno region's performance be more than 10 percentage points lower than the statewide \nlevel of performance during the reporting period. \n7.  \"Region\" means one of the three administrative subdivisions of DSHS as established by \nthe Department effective May 1, 2011.  They are: Region 1, with the Regional Office in \nSpokane; Region 2, with the Regional Office in Seattle; and Region 3, with the Regional \nOffice in Tacoma.  Unless otherwise specified in Section VI below, regional performance \nwill be measured by these three regions for all performance data generated subsequent to \nJuly 1, 2011.  For Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, regional performance will be measured by the \nperformance data generated for the six regions in existence as of July 1,2010. \n3 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31,2011 \n\n8.  \"Professional Standards\" means the standards of practice related to the care and treatment \nof children in the custody of DSHS that were developed in March 2007 by the Oversight \nPanel pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Settlement Agreement. \nV.  DURATION OF AGREEMENT AND FULL COMPLIANCE WITH OUTCOMES \n1.  Duration of the Agreement.  This Agreement replaces the original Settlement Agreement \nand will be in effect for 26 months, starting November 1,2011, and ending December 31, \n2013, after which the Department shall have no reporting obligations under this \nAgreement except to provide the Plaintiffs with final data on the Department's \nperformance for the period ending on December 31, 2013.  The case of Braam v. State of \nWashington, No. 98-2-01570-1, shall be fully dismissed with prejudice on March 31, \n2014, unless prior to that date: (1) the parties have entered into a signed agreement to \nextend andlor modify this Agreement; (2) the Court has already terminated this \nAgreement pursuant to Section V.3; or (3) Plaintiffs have commenced judicial \nenforcement proceedings.  In the event Plaintiffs receive data on the Department's \nperformance for the final monitoring period of July 1,2013, to December 31,2013, after \nMarch 31,2014, this Agreement is extended for 30 days from the date on which the data \non the Department's performance is provided to Plaintiffs' counsel. \n2.  Phased Exit Due to Full Compliance with Individual Outcomes.  The Department shall \nachieve full compliance with any specific outcome listed in Section VI by meeting or \nexceeding the \"full compliance measure\" for that outcome for 18 consecutive months.  If \nthe Department achieves the full compliance measure for a specific outcome for 18 \nconsecutive months at any time prior to the end of this Agreement, that outcome will no \nlonger be monitored by or enforceable by the Plaintiffs or subject to a Motion to Enforce \npursuant to Section VA.  For areas in which the outcome or data source has been changed \nby this Agreement, the Department's performance during the FY 2011 (July 1,2010, to \nJune 30, 2011) reporting period shall not count toward achieving compliance with the full \ncompliance measure, except that the Department's performance in FY 2011 for Outcome \n3 (Child Health and Education Track (CHET) screen completion) and Outcome 4 (annual \nmental health and substance abuse screen completion) as they are stated in Section VI \nbelow shall count toward compliance. \n3.  Early Exit Due to Full Compliance with Each and Every Outcome.  At any time prior to \nthe expiration of this Agreement, if the Department has achieved the full compliance \nmeasure, as defined in Section IV, for each and every outcome listed in Section VI of this \nAgreement, the Department may seek a court order asking for termination of this \n. Agreement and dismissal of the case. \n4.  Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce Agreement.  If no Motion to Enforce or Notice ofIntent to \nEnforce Agreement is filed within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the Department's \ndata on its performance for the final reporting period of July 1,2013, to December 31, \n2013, the dismissal of the case with prejudice will be final.  Plaintiffs' right to timely \n4 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31,2011 \n\ninitiate an enforcement action shall be satisfied by a simple pleading (such as a Notice of \nIntent to Initiate Enforcement Action), to be followed by more specific pleadings \npursuant to a briefing schedule established by the court. \n5.  By entering into this Agreement, the parties do not waive or limit any rights, legal claims \nor arguments, or remedies that may be available to either party in responding to a motion \nbrought by the other party unless clearly waived or limited herein. \n6.  This Agreement is entered into between the parties without prejudice to the right of a new \nGovernor or Secretary of the DSHS to seek renegotiation or modification by mutual \nagreement of any of the terms or provisions set forth herein. \nVI.  ENFORCEABLE OUTCOMES \nThe following outcomes will be the measurable and enforceable outcomes for the' duration of this \nAgreement.  Compliance for each outcome will be monitored in six-month periods unless \notherwise specified below.  The Department will issue data on its performance regarding \nenforceable outcomes within three months of the end of the reporting period for the outcome, \nunless otherwise specified below.  As further set forth in this Agreement, the Department will be \ndeemed to be in full compliance with an individual outcome if it achieves the \"full compliance \nmeasure\" for 18 consecutive months.  For areas in which the outcome or data source has been \nchanged by this Agreement, the Department's performance during the FY 2011 (July 1, 2010, to \nJune 30, 2011) reporting period shall not count toward achieving compliance with the full \ncompliance measure, except that the Department's performance in FY 2011 for Outcome 3 \n(CHET screen completion) and Outcome 4 (annual mental health and substance abuse screen \ncompletion) as they are stated below shall count toward compliance.  The parties may mutually \nagree to change the data source for measuring compliance with an individual outcome. \nUnless otherwise specifically indicated, the outcomes and reporting requirements set forth below \nreplace and supersede the outcomes, benchmarks, reporting requirements, and any action steps in \nthe Oversight Panel's July 3, 2008, Revised Implementation Plan. \nOutcome 1: Children in out-of-home care will receive a private and individual face-to \nface health and safety visit from their assigned caseworker, or acceptable substitute \nworker, at least once every calendar month. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of children in out-of-home care (including trial \nreturn home) will receive a health and safety visit each and every month they are in \ncare by their assigned CA caseworker or an acceptable CA or private agency worker. \nAs currently measured by the Oversight Panel under the July 2008 Revised \nImplementation Plan, and consistent with the reporting measure required by the \nfederal government, CA must provide a visit to an individual child in each month of \nthe 12-month reporting period described below for that child's case to count as \ncompliant. \n5 \nBraam v, State of Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31, 2011 \n\nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months with each report covering the previous 12-month calendar or fiscal year. \nBecause data will be reported every six months and compliance is measured over \ntwelve months, consecutive reporting periods may count towards measuring whether \nthe Department has met or exceeded full compliance for this outcome for 18 \nconsecutive months even though the reports cover overlapping 12-month periods. \nOutcome 2: Caseworkers will have caseloads at or below 18.0 cases per caseworker. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of CA caseworkers carrying cases of children in the \nPlaintiff Class as defined in Section IV above will have caseloads of 18.0 or fewer \ncases. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months. \nThis outcome will no longer be monitored or enforceable under this Agreement when \nthe Department has achieved the full compliance measure for all of the following \noutcomes in this Agreement: Outcome 1 (monthly visits); Outcome 3 (CRET \nscreens); Outcome 6 (placement stability); Outcome 7 (sibling placement); Outcome \n8 (sibling visits); Outcome 11 (foster parent information); Outcome 13 (safety in \nfoster care); Outcome 14 (school moves); Outcome 15 (educational needs); Outcome \n16 (children identified as sexually aggressive (SAY)); Outcome 17 (children \nidentified as physically assaultive or physically aggressive (PAA Y)); Outcome 18 \n(medically fragile children); and Outcome 19 (youth transition staffing).  The parties \nagree that this list of outcomes has no bearing on the importance of the outcomes and \nin no way affects Plaintiffs' ability to enforce those outcomes listed or not listed \nabove. \nOutcome 3: Children in out-of-home care for 45 days or longer will have completed and \ndocumented CRET screens within 30 days of entering care. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of children who remain in out-of-home care for 45 \nor more consecutive days will have a CRET screen completed within 30 days of \nentering care. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months. \nOutcome 4: Children in out-of-home care will be screened for mental health and \nsubstance abuse needs every 12 months. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of children who remain in out-of-home care for 365 \nconsecutive days or longer will have an annual Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, \nand Treatment (EPSDT) exam or other valid mental health screen during the \nmeasurement year. \n6 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31,2011 \n\nData Source and Reporting Period: DSHS Medicaid billing records, CA \nadministrative data, and case review of a sample of 100 cases determined by \nadministrative data to be non-compliant every 12 months for the fiscal year.  Case \nreview will determine whether an annual EPSDT exam or other valid mental health \nscreening occurred during the measurement year.  Both administrative data and case \nreview results will determine the Department's compliance with this outcome.  The \nDepartment will issue data on its performance for this outcome nine months after the \nend of the reporting period. \nOutcome 5: All referrals alleging child abuse and neglect of children in out-of-home care \nwill receive thorough investigation by the Division of Licensing Resources (DLR) \npursuant to CA policy and timeline and with required documentation. \nFull Compliance Measure: 95% of referrals alleging child abuse and neglect of \nchildren in out-of-home care will receive thorough investigation by DLR pursuant to \nCA policy and timeline and with required documentation. \nData Source and Reporting Period: Case review using a stratified sampling \nmethodology at the 95% statewide confidence level (measuring timeliness and \nthoroughness of investigation) will be conducted and results will be provided every \n12 months for the fiscal year.  The Department will issue data on its performance for \nthis outcome nine months after the end of the reporting period. \nOutcome 6: The percentage of children who experience two or fewer placements during \ntheir current out-of-home episode of care will not decline (outcome measure based on \npercentage of youth entering care during the two previous fiscal years with two or fewer \nplacements (with time-in-care specifications based on entry year)). \nFull Compliance Measure: The percentage of children who experience two or fewer \nplacements during their current out-of-home episode of care will remain at or above \n90%. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months with each report covering the previous 24 months.  Because data will be \nreported every six months and compliance is measured over 24 months, consecutive \nreporting periods may count towards measuring whether the Department has met or \nexceeded full compliance for this outcome for 18 consecutive months even though the \nreports cover overlapping 24-month periods. \nOutcome 7: Children in out-of-home care will be placed with their siblings who are also \nin out-of-home care whenever possible. \nFull Compliance Measure: 75% of children in out-of-home care will be placed with \ntheir siblings who are also in out-of-home care whenever possible. \n7 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31, 2011 \n\nData Source and Reporting Period: Case review of 90 cases in which siblings were \nremoved together and remained in care at least 30 days will be completed and \nprovided every six months.  Exceptions to CA policy requiring siblings be placed \ntogether are attached as Appendix A and will be incorporated into the case review. \nWhen appropriate exceptions apply, the Department will review additional cases up \nto a limit of 20% of the original sample size.  The Department's performance will be \ndetermined based on the percent of cases in which siblings were placed together out \nof those in which siblings were removed together and remained in care at least 30 \ndays, excluding from the numerator and denominator of the measure those not placed \ntogether due to appropriate exceptions. \nOutcome 8: Children placed apart from their siblings will have two or more monthly \nvisits or contacts (not including staffing meetings or court events), with their siblings \nunless the case meets an exception agreed to by the parties. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of children placed apart from their siblings will \nhave two or more monthly visits or contacts (not including staffing meetings or court \nevents) with their siblings. \nFull compliance for this outcome does not require consideration of regional \nvariation due to the relatively small number of cases that will be reviewed in \nthe reporting period. \nData Source and Reporting Period: Case review of 50 cases of children who have \nbeen separated from at least one sibling as a result of the child's placement in out-of \nhome care will be completed and provided every six months.  Exceptions to CA \npolicy requiring sibling visits are attached as Appendix B and will be incorporated \ninto the case review.  When appropriate exceptions apply, the Department will review \nadditional cases up to a limit of 20% of the original sample size.  The Department's \nperformance will be determined based on the percent of cases in which siblings \nplaced apart had two or more monthly visits or contacts out of those in which siblings \nwere placed apart, excluding from the numerator and denominator of the measure \nthose cases in which sibling visits or contacts did not occur due to appropriate \nexceptions. \nOutcome 9: Licensed caregivers will report receiving adequate training for their roles \nand responsibilities. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of licensed caregivers will report receiving \nadequate training for their roles and responsibilities. \nData Source and Reporting Period: The Department will conduct an annual survey \nof foster parents and provide the results annually. \nThis outcome will no longer be monitored or enforceable under this Agreement when \nthe Department has achieved the full compliance measure for all of the following \noutcomes in this Agreement: Outcome 1 (monthly visits); Outcome 6 (placement \n8 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31, 2011 \n\nstability); Outcome 8 (sibling visits); Outcome 11 (foster parent information); \nOutcome 12 (ratio of foster care beds); Outcome 16 (children identified as SAY); \nOutcome 17 (children identified as P AAY  ); and Outcome 18 (medically fragile \nchildren). The parties agree that this list of outcomes has no bearing on the \nimportance of the outcomes and in no way affects Plaintiffs' ability to enforce those \noutcomes listed or not listed above. \nOutcome 10: Licensed caregivers will report receiving adequate support for their roles \nand responsibilities. \nFull Compliance Measure: 90% of licensed caregivers will report receiving \nadequate support for their roles and responsibilities. \nData Source and Reporting Period: The Depmiment will conduct an annual survey \nof foster parents and provide the results annually. \nThis outcome will no longer be monitored or enforceable under this Agreement when \nthe Department has achieved the full compliance measure for all of the following \noutcomes in this Agreement: Outcome 1 (monthly visits); Outcome 6 (placement \nstability); Outcome 8 (sibling visits); Outcome 11 (foster parent information); \nOutcome 12 (ratio of foster care beds); Outcome 16 (children identified as SAY); \nOutcome 17 (children identified as P AA Y); and Outcome 18 (medically fragile \nchildren).  The parties agree that this list of outcomes has no bearing on the \nimportance of the outcomes and in no way affects Plaintiffs' ability to enforce those \noutcomes listed or not listed above. \nOutcome 11: Licensed caregivers will receive appropriate and timely information about \nthe needs of children placed with them. \nFull Compliance Measure:  90% of licensed and unlicensed caregivers will be \nprovided adequate information about the needs of the child placed with them \n(including but not limited to behavioral, medical, developmental and educational \nneeds). \nData Source and Reporting Period: The first reporting period for this outcome will \nbe from January 1,2012, to June 30, 2012.  This outcome will be measured by case \nreview of children in out-of-home care for more than 30 days who were initially \nplaced or changed placements within the last six months.  The sample size for the \ninitial case reviews will be 50 cases.  When performance exceeds 20 percent, the \nsubsequent case review samples will increase to 100.  When performance exceeds 40 \npercent, the subsequent case review samples will increase to 200.  The results of these \nreviews will be provided every six months. \nCase review will measure whether the caseworker provided the caregiver a completed \nChild Information / Placement Referral Form (DSHS 15-300).  Compliance is \nachieved when the referral form is signed by the caregiver indicating they received \n9 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31,2011 \n\nthe information and dated showing that they received the information within the \nrequired timeframes or verified by Department records showing an email containing \nthe information was sent to the foster parent within the required timeframe.  The \nrequired timeframes are: within 72 hours of an initial placement; and at or before a \nplanned change in placement or within 24 hours of an urgent placement change. \nChildren's Administration will convene a workgroup to review the Child Information \nand Placement Referral Form (DSHS 15-300) to ensure it contains all information \nrequired to be provided to caregivers.  The workgroup members will include the \nfollowing: CA regional staff, Plaintiffs' counsel, youth currently or formerly in foster \ncare (Passion to Action), foster parents/caregivers, Fostering Well-Being Unit staff, \nand others as identified.  If the form is revised, the Department's performance on \nproviding the revised form to caregivers will be determined in the reporting period \nthat begins after the form is revised and uploaded into CA's administrative data \nsystem. \nOutcome 12: The Department will maintain an adequate ratio of licensed foster care \nbeds to children in licensed foster homes. \nFull Compliance Measure: The average monthly ratio of licensed foster care beds to \nchildren in licensed care will be at least 2.0. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months. \nOutcome 13: The percentage of children who are not victims of a founded report of child \nabuse or neglect by a foster parent or facility staff member will meet or exceed the \nfederal Child and Family Services Review (round 2) standard. \nFull Compliance Measure: At least 99.68% of children will not be victims of a \nfounded report of child abuse or neglect by a foster parent or facility staff member. \nThe Department is not required to meet the regional variation in order to \nachieve the full compliance measure. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data developed for federal \nreport will be provided every 12 months for the fiscal year. \nOutcome 14: The number of school age children who experience a change in school \nwhen they enter out-of-home care or change placement during the school year will \nremain at or below 20.0%. \nFull Compliance Measure: No more than 20.0% of school age children entering out \nof-home care or changing placement during a school year will experience a change of \nschools.  Children being placed with relatives or siblings are excluded from this \nmeasure. \n10 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31, 2011 \n\nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \n12 months for the fiscal year. \nOutcome 15: Caseworkers will take the required steps to meet the educational needs of \nchildren in out-of-home care. \nFull Compliance Measure: For the first six-month reporting period the Department \nwill take the required steps to meet the educational needs of'80% of school age \nchildren in out-of-home care.  For the second six-month reporting period the \nDepartment will take the required steps to meet the educational needs of 85% of \nschool age children in out-of-home care.  For subsequent six-month reporting periods, \nthe Department will take the required steps to meet the educational needs of 90% of \nschool age children in out-of-home care. \nData Source and Reporting Period: A case review of 100 cases every six months \nwill be completed and results will be provided every six months.  The sample will be \nstratified to ensure that cases for children across grade levels are reviewed.  The first \nreporting period for this outcome will be January 1,2012, to June 30, 2012.  Case \nreview will measure the Department's performance on the following elements: \nattendance; emollment; academic progress; special education where appropriate; \ndiscipline; planning for post-secondary education or training where appropriate; and \nwhether the education plan was completed and updated every six months. \nOutcomes for Special Populations of Children in CA Custody \nOutcome 16: Children identified as sexually aggressive (SAY) pursuant to the statutory \ndefinition will be placed with caregivers who have received specialized training and have \na plan developed to address safety and supervision issues. \nFull Compliance Measure: 95% of children identified as SAY pursuant to the \nstatutory definition will be placed with caregivers who have received specialized \ntraining and have a plan developed to address safety and supervision issues. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months. \nOutcome 17: Children identified as physically assaultive or physically aggressive \n(P AAY  ) pursuant to the statutory definition will be placed with caregivers who have \nreceived specialized training and have a plan developed to address safety and supervision \nIssues. \nFull Compliance Measure: 95% of children identified as P AAY   pursuant to the \nstatutory definition will be placed with caregivers who have received specialized \ntraining and have a plan developed to address safety and supervision issues. \n11 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31, 2011 \n\nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months. \nOutcome 18: Medically fragile children will be connected to ongoing and appropriate \nmedical care and placed with caregivers who have specialized skills or receive \nconsultation and ongoing training regarding their caretaking responsibilities for the \nmedical condition. \nFull Compliance Measure: 95% of medically fragile children will be connected to \nongoing and appropriate medical care, will have their medically fragile status \ndocumented in CA's administrative data system, and will have their Caregiver \nSupport Plan uploaded into CA's administrative data system. \nData Source and Reporting Period: For the first six-month reporting period, the \nDepartment will conduct a case review of medically fragile children who receive care \ncoordination from the Fostering Well-Being Unit.  For all subsequent six month \nreporting periods, the Department will conduct a case review of all medically fragile \nchildren.  Case review results will be provided every six months.  The case review \nwill determine whether medically fragile children were connected with ongoing and \nappropriate medical care, their medically fragile status is documented in CA's \nadministrative data system, and the Caregiver Support Plan is uploaded into CA's \nadministrative data system. \nOutcome 19: A multi-disciplinary staffing meeting will be held at least six months \nbefore a youth in foster care turns 18 years old to address issues related to transition to \nindependence. \nFull Compliance Measure: 95% of youth in foster care who are turning 18 years old \nwill have a multi-disciplinary staffing meeting at least six months prior to turning 18 \nyears old to address issues related to transition to independence. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months. \nOutcome 20: The percentage of children who run from out-of-home care placements will \nbe reduced. \nFull Compliance Measure: No more than 2.35%of children in foster care will run \nfrom out-of-home care placements. \nCompliance with this outcome requires the full compliance measure to be met. \nIn addition, for full compliance to be met, the data must indicate that less than \n2.59% of children in foster care in each region ran from out-of-home \nplacements. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months with each report covering the previous 12-month calendar or fiscal year. \n12 \nBraam v. State a/Washington: Revised Settlement and Exit Agreement  October 31, 2011 \n\nBecause data will be reported every six months and compliance is measured over \ntwelve months, consecutive reporting periods may count towards measuring whether \nthe Department has met or exceeded full compliance for this outcome for 18 \nconsecutive months even though the reports cover overlapping 12-month periods. \nOutcome 21: The median number of days that children are on runaway status will be \nreduced. \nFull Compliance Measure: The median number of days that children are on \nrunaway status will be no more than 25.0. \nCompliance with this outcome requires the full compliance measure to be met. \nIn addition, for full compliance to be met, the data must indicate that the \nmedian number of days that children are on runaway status in each region \nmust be less than 30.0 during the 12-month period measuring full compliance. \nData Source and Reporting Period: CA administrative data will be provided every \nsix months with each report covering the previous 12-month calendar or fiscal year. \nBecause data will be reported every six months and compliance is measured over \ntwelve months, consecutive reporting periods may count towards measuring whether \nthe Department has met or exceeded full compliance for this outcome for 18 \nconsecutive months even though the reports cover overlapping 12-month periods. \nVII.  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT \nWithin one day of publicly submitting to the Office of Financial Management a budget decision \npackage that may relate to the Department's compliance with this Agreement, the Department \nwill notify Plaintiffs of the decision package, explain the elements of the decision package, and \nidentify those parts that the Department believes are relevant to compliance with this \nAgreement.

This Settlement Agreement is entered into in recognition of the following: \n \n(cid:1)  Plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit in the matter of Braam v. State of Washington. \n \n(cid:1)  The parties seek to resolve the issues and claims set forth in the complaint by the \nexecution  of  this  Agreement.  The  parties  enter  into  this  Agreement  with  the \nrecognition that both parties and their counsel have committed to enter into specific, \nmeasurable and enforceable agreements with the goal of improving the conditions \nand treatment of children in the custody of the Division of Children and Family \nServices (“DCFS”) of the State of Washington’s Department of Social and Health \nServices (the “Department”), as to the conditions and treatment of children in the \nPlaintiff class. \n \nTherefore, the parties agree as follows: \n \n2.  The parties agree that the Department’s Kids Come First Phase II (KCF II) is the State’s \ncomprehensive plan to improve child welfare practice, including the six general areas that \nare the subject of the complaint filed by the Plaintiffs. The Department agrees to improve \nthe  treatment  and  condition  of  children  in  the  Plaintiff  class  by  making  specific, \nmeasurable and enforceable commitments as set forth herein. The Department further \nagrees to modify KCF II to include the Goals, Outcomes, Benchmarks and Action Steps \nidentified in this Agreement within 30 days of the signing of the Agreement and to make \nadditional  modifications  to  the  KCF  II  in  accordance  with  Section  III.5.g  of  this \nAgreement.  The  parties  acknowledge  that  nothing  in  this  Agreement  constitutes \nPlaintiffs’ endorsement of the entire KCF II Plan, and also that only the sections of \nKCF II that are included in this Agreement are subject to this Agreement’s enforcement \nprovisions under Section V, herein. \n \n3.  The parties agree to create an independent Panel of experts from different disciplines \nwith authority to establish Professional Standards, Outcomes, Benchmarks and Action \nSteps to improve the treatment of and conditions for children in the custody of DCFS and \nto monitor the Department’s performance under this Agreement. The parties agree that \nthe Panel is being created to assist the parties in achieving the goals of this Settlement as \ndescribed  herein,  but  not  to  supplant  the  day-to-day  management  and  leadership \nresponsibilities and authority of the Department. \n \n4.  The parties agree that additional financial resources will be necessary to comply with \nsome of the provisions of these agreements.  The parties agree to make all reasonable \nefforts  to  obtain  funding  for  implementation,  including  but  not  limited  to,  the \nDepartment’s obligation to prepare line item budget requests and support and advocate \nfor sufficient appropriations. \nBraam v.

The  values  of  shared  decision-making  and  information  sharing  between  public  and \nprivate partners in the child welfare system are reflected throughout the KCF II.  This \nAgreement shall be interpreted consistent with those values. \n \n \nII.

Provided, however, if the non-compliance is due to a claim \nof lack of funding, enforcement proceedings shall be governed by Section V.B.2 \nbelow. \n \nB.  Enforcement Provisions \n \nThe  parties  agree  that  this  Agreement  provides  for  three  types  of  enforcement \nproceedings, including, enforcement proceedings in which (i) non-compliance is based on \na failure of implementation; (ii) non-compliance is based on a lack of funding; and (iii) \nnon-compliance involves a combination of (i) and (ii).  The following sets forth the \nparties’ agreements for each of these conditions:  \nBraam v. State of Washington Final Settlement    13  July 31, 2004 \n\n \n1.   Non-Compliance Based on Failure to Implement \n \ni.  If the Panel makes a finding in any of its reports that the Department has \nnot implemented one or more of the Action Steps set forth above, or that \nthe  Department  has  failed  to  reach  the  annual  Benchmarks,  the \nDepartment shall, within 30 days of the issuance of the report, submit a \nproposed  compliance  plan.    This  compliance  plan  shall  include \ntimetables,  and  may  include  additional  or  different  Action  Steps  for \nachieving compliance with the Outcomes and Benchmarks. Plaintiffs may \ncomment on the proposed compliance plan, within two weeks of receipt \nof  the  Department’s  plan.    The  Department  will  have  two  weeks  to \nconsider the Plaintiffs’ comments and make such revisions as it deems \nappropriate.  The Panel shall then have 14 days to accept or reject the \nplan. \n \nii.  If the Panel rejects the plan, the Department may submit a revised plan \nwithin 21 days. Plaintiffs may comment on the revised plan within 10 \ndays of receipt of the Department’s revised plan. The Panel shall then \nhave 14 days to accept or reject the revised plan.  \n \niii.  If the Panel rejects a compliance plan or if the Department fails to submit \na plan within the required time period, the Plaintiffs may seek a court \norder to enforce those provisions.  \n \niv.  If the Panel accepts the Department’s proposed compliance plan, the \nDepartment will have 6 months to implement the plan before the Panel \nwill make a report on compliance.  If at the end of six months the Panel \nfinds that there is a failure to implement the compliance plan and achieve \nthe  Outcomes  and  Benchmarks,  Plaintiffs  may  seek  a court  order to \nenforce those provisions.  \n \n2.    Non-Compliance Due to Lack of Funding \n \ni.  At the time that the Department submits a compliance plan or a revised \ncompliance plan to the Panel as described in Section V.B.1(i) and (ii), it \nmust identify those Benchmarks or Action Steps which have not been \nimplemented or achieved or which can not be implemented or achieved \ndue to lack of funding.   \n \nii.   If the Department identifies lack of funding as the basis for its non-\ncompliance, Plaintiffs may immediately commence an enforcement action \nin  court  on  behalf  of  the  Plaintiff  class,  based  on  a  claim  that  the \nnoncompliance results in constitutionally inadequate care to members of \nthe class.  In any such enforcement proceeding, the parties agree that the \n“Professional Standards” applicable to the six areas identified in this Part \nIV of this Agreement are those standards identified through the process \nset forth in Part III 5.c.  The parties agree that the court can order \nexpenditures to enforce constitutional mandates only if the court finds \nthat non-compliance results in failing to provide constitutionally adequate \nBraam v. State of Washington Final Settlement    14  July 31, 2004 \n\n \ncare to children in the Plaintiff class.  Nothing in this paragraph prevents \nPlaintiffs from challenging the Defendant’s assertion that lack of funding \nis the reason for non-compliance. \n \n3.    Non-Compliance Due to Failure to Implement and Lack of Funding \n \nIn the event that the Panel finds that non-compliance is the result of both lack of \nfunding and failure to implement, the Panel can require the Department to develop a \ncompliance plan as described in Section V.B.1 regarding Non-Compliance Due to \nFailure  to  Implement,  while  Plaintiffs,  if  they  choose,  simultaneously  pursue \nremedies specified in Section V.B.2. \n \n \nVI.  CLASS COUNSEL \n \n1.  Plaintiffs’  counsel,  through  the  Panel,  will  have  access  to  systemic  data  about  the \nPlaintiff class and information about named Plaintiffs. \n \n2.  Within 12 months after the date of this Agreement, Plaintiffs’ counsel will be offered an \nopportunity  to  participate  in  an  established  quality  service  review  process  of  the \nDepartment, to be identified by the Department in collaboration with the Panel, that \ngathers information relevant to assessing progress towards achieving the goals of this \nAgreement. \n \n \nVIII.  APPROVAL AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT \n \n1.  This Settlement Agreement shall remain in force for a period of 84 months from the date \nhereof unless an enforcement action (including any action before the Panel, mediator or \ncourt) is pending or, the Agreement is terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the \nparties.  In any event, the lawsuit shall be dismissed and the Agreement terminated when \nthe Outcomes have been achieved and sustained for a period of two years. \n \n2.  The parties agree that the currently assigned Judge may consider, approve or disapprove \nthis Settlement Agreement and that such action shall have no effect on the pending \nrecusal motions and Affidavits of Prejudice filed by Defendants. \n \n3.  The parties agree that this Agreement will be submitted to the Whatcom County Superior \nCourt for review and approval pursuant to Civil Rule 23.  The parties agree to request \nthat the Court enter an Order approving the Settlement Agreement, retaining jurisdiction \nfor enforcement purposes only as set forth in Section V.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBraam v. State of Washington Final Settlement    15  July 31, 2004 \n\n \n \nIX.  ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n \n1.  Within 10 days following court approval of this Agreement, Defendants shall cause to be \npaid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel the sum of ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND \nDOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($1,600,000.00 ).  By August 1, 2005, Defendants shall \ncause to be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel the sum of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND \nDOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($100,000.00).  By August 1, 2006, Defendants shall \ncause  to  be  paid  to  Plaintiffs  Counsel  the  sum  of  ONE  HUNDRED  THOUSAND \nDOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($100,000.00).   \n \n2.  The payments pursuant to Section IX.1 are in full and final settlement of any and all \nclaims  that  Plaintiffs  have  or  could  assert  for  attorneys’  fees  or  costs  of  any  kind \nregarding services rendered to the Plaintiff class up to and including the date of this \nAgreement through July 31, 2006.  This provision constitutes a waiver by Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel for any and all fees or costs they incur in the period between July 31, 2004 and \nJuly 31, 2006. \n \n3.  Beginning  August  1,  2006,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  seek  an  award  of  reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in an enforcement action under Section V of this \nAgreement and Defendants are entitled to oppose such an award. \n \n \nBraam v.
