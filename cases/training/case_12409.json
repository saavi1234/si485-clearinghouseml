    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the actions of twenty-one state and city officials, caseworkers, and supervisors who administered Maryland's federally-funded foster care program in Baltimore City, Maryland.</p>\r\n<p>The class action, filed on December 5, 1984, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Baltimore), alleged that the defendants' administration of the foster program subjected the plaintiffs to physical and sexual abuse as well as medical neglect. They sought broad interim and permanent injunctive relief as well as monetary damages against the state to redress deficiencies in the foster care program, claiming that the state violated the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, Title IV-E and IV-B of the Social Security Act, the Fourteenth Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. 1983.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and the Public Justice Center. On January 2, 1987, the court certified a class of all current, former, and future children who are, have been, or will be placed in foster homes by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS) and are or will be in BCDSS custody either through voluntary placement or court order. The next month, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. In April, the court found overwhelming evidence of systematic deficiencies in Baltimore's foster care system. Specifically, the court found that satisfactory homes were lacking, that the defendants did not remove children away from abusive or neglectful homes, that homes were licensed to foster parents unable to care for the children, that foster children received inadequate medical care, and that the defendants did not make the improvements suggested previously.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the preliminary injunction on July 27, 1987, in which the defendants were ordered to review the status of each foster home reported for maltreatment, visit each child in BCDSS foster home monthly, visit each child subject to a maltreatment report weekly, ensure appropriate medical care is provided for each child, and provide written copies of any maltreatment complaint of a foster child to the juvenile court as well as the child's attorney.</p>\r\n<p>On February 1, 1988, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction, holding that foster children in BCDSS custody were entitled to preliminary relief from administration deficiencies in the foster children program, and that city and state officials administrating the state's federally funded foster care program were not immune from damages for failing to protect foster children in foster homes. 838 F. 2d 118.</p>\r\n<p>On April 26, 1988, the parties submitted a settlement agreement embodying the measures from the preliminary injunctive order, as well as new proposals to make substantial improvements to the foster care system. Specifically, it states that the defendants will limit the caseload amount per caseworker, improve the system for providing medical care to foster children, provide assistance to natural parents to avoid foster care when possible, and seek new foster homes. All these improvements were to be made within two years. The court approved the notice for class action settlement to be sent in May. (Attorneys' fees were to be addressed separately from the decree.) The Consent Decree was approved on September 27, 1988, and was later modified in 1991 to extend its protection to children in BCDSS custody who are placed in unlicensed placements with relatives. 699 F.Supp. 508.</p>\r\n<p>For several years, Plaintiffs monitored the decree; however, compliance has been difficult to obtain. On April 13, 2007, the plaintiffs sent a status report to the court regarding failed mediation sessions and the plaintiffs' intent to prepare contempt papers. The defendants responded by sending a letter to the court expressing their disappointment with the plaintiffs' desire to file a motion for contempt. The defendants stated their interest in working together, and that the new Secretary of the Maryland Department of Human Resources, who started working with this case a few months ago, has taken a hands-on approach with the intent to implement the provisions of the decree. Although the defendants would not agree to an expanded court monitor during previous negotiations, the defendant stated their willingness to explore options regarding the use of a monitor with the governor's office and to implement a plan with enforceable benchmarks.</p>\r\n<p>About 7 months later, the plaintiffs filed a petition for an order of enforcement to show cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt of the consent decree, and also a motion to modify the consent decree. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated over 90 provisions of the decree, and requested that the defendants establish a monitor. Alternatively, the plaintiffs stated that, if the defendants did not establish a monitor, the defendants should be required to provide the plaintiffs' counsel with full access to relevant databases and case files.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations ensued, and the parties agreed to a Modified Consent Decree; the court approved it on October 9, 2009. The decree states that the goal is to provide a safe, nurturing, permanent home for children as quickly as possible, and that family involvement in decision-making is critical.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, a month later, the defendants appealed to the Fourth Circuit, seeking to vacate the 1988 consent decree and deny the entry of the modified decree on the basis of Horne v. Flores (129 S. Ct. 2579 (2009), a then-recent Supreme Court ruling regarding the application of Rule 60(b)(5). On January 26, 2011, the Fourth Circuit denied the appeal and affirmed the Court's orders approving and entering the MCD. 633 F.3d 297.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs' contempt motion from 2007 was still pending, but in January 2012, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed that motion. Compliance reports were still being filed every six months as of March 2012, but that is so far the final such report.</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued to submit status reports to the court in accordance with the Modified Consent Decree. On December 20, 2023, the case was reassigned to Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher. On July 23, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to substitute the current named defendant and update the docket, which the court granted. The parties continued to negotiate modifications to the decree. The last status report was filed on November 27, 2024, when Judge Gallagher approved the parties&rsquo; proposed plan to modify the Modified Consent Decree. The judge urged the parties to prioritize in-person meetings over written proposals going forward. The case remains ongoing.</p>",

NOTE: \nDaycare services for private treatment foster care homes and private purchase of \ncare families are not included in this policy. \nImplementation of this policy will provide public foster families and formal kinship \nproviders with supplemental supportive services that will reduce multiple placements and \nremove barriers that might impede the foster parent recruitment and retention process. \nProviding dayc are will preserve placements and protect children at risk of multiple \nplacements. \nBackground \nCurrent policy regarding daycare services for children who are committed to the local \ndepartment went into effect July 1, 1991.  This service was specifically for public foster \nfamilies who provided regular and intermediate foster care services.  Due to the limited \navailability of funding, daycare subsidies for public foster families were not uniformly \nprovided. \nRecently, the state of Maryland has initiated a vigorous public foster parent recruitment \nand retention campaign.  A major component of the campaign entails the recruitment of \n1,000 Maryland foster homes by 2010.  To achieve this goal, it is essential that current \nand potential foster families be provided with daycare subsidies to defray the cost of \ndaycare for their foster children. \nGrandfathering - Currently some local departments use annual flex funds at varying \nlevels to support daycare services for family foster care and formal kinship placements. \nIn cases where flex funds have been utilized prior to the effective date of this letter to \nsupport daycare services throughout the year for children ages 6 to 12 years old, this \nsupport will continue to be funded using the annual flex fund allotments.  This only \napplies to families with children currently in placement and currently receiving this \nsubsidy, and will maintain support at the current levels and rates.  New placements are \nsubject to following the guidelines for eligibility and payment of day care services \noutlined below. \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-2   Filed 06/22/09   Page 3 of 12\nCircular letter SSA  08-17 \n3 of 11 \nFOSTER/FORMAL KINSHIP FAMILY DAY CARE SERVICES \nDEFINITIONS  Foster /Formal Kinship Family Daycare- a subsidy provided to public \nfoster parents and kinship providers to reduce financial responsibility of \nproviding daycare for children in foster care. \nA Daycare Provider -a qualified caregiver licensed or informal and \nscreened in by the local department of social services or the foster \nfamily to provide daycare services for children in foster care \nDaycare Center- a licensed facility that provides child care services \nwith a capacity for more than eight children, that is: \n(a) Licensed underCOMAR 13Al4.02 by MSDE \n(b) Operates under a letter of compliance issued under CO MAR \n13Al4.05 by the MSDE; \n(c) Licensed by any branch of the military under applicable military \nchild care regulations; \n(d) Operated by a public school; or \n(e) Licensed by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as a \nyouth camp as defined by Health-General Article, § 14-401, Annotated \nCode of Maryland. \nFamily Dayc are -the care given to a child in place of parental care for \nless than 24 hours a day in a residence other than the child's residence, \nfor which the provider is paid in cash or in kind. \nInformal Day care Provider-a relative or a close friend of the foster \nparent that can provide daycare services in the foster family's home if \ncertain qualifications are met.

Beller, Assistant Attorney Gen-\neral, OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MARY-\nLAND,  Baltimore, Maryland, for Appellants. Rhonda B.\nLipkin, PUBLIC JUSTICE CENTER, INC., Baltimore, Mary-\nland, for Appellee. \nOPINION\nDUNCAN, Circuit Judge: \nThis is an appeal from the denial of a motion under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) to vacate a 1988 consent\ndecree and from the entry of a subsequent modified decree.\nBoth decrees were designed to reform the Baltimore, Mary-\nland foster care system. The appeal is based on allegations\nthat changes in the law brought about by Supreme Court deci-\nsions have eliminated the legal bases for the decrees. We\naffirm the well-reasoned decision of the district court. \nI.\nThe parties to this appeal have a lengthy history together,\nan understanding of which is essential to a consideration of\nthe issues presented. In 1984, Appellees, a class of foster chil-\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 4\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 4 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 3\ndren in the care and custody of the Baltimore City Department\nof Social Services (\"BCDSS\"), brought a civil rights action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §  1983 against BCDSS and numerous\ncity  and state foster care officials and personnel\n(\"Appellants\"). The complaint alleged that Appellants’ mis-\nmanagement of the Baltimore foster care program resulted in\nthe children suffering physical abuse, sexual abuse, medical\nneglect, and otherwise being subjected to dangerous living\nconditions.  It further asserted that Appellants’ actions and\nfailings violated Appellees’ rights under the Adoption Assis-\ntance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (\"AACWA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 620 et seq., and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment  to the United States Constitution. The action\nsought equitable relief and monetary damages. \nIn 1987, after conducting extensive discovery that included\na random sampling review of BCDSS foster care records,\nAppellees filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The\nmotion alleged that class members were at risk of suffering\nirreparable  harm caused by abuse and neglect, inadequate\nmedical care, and the placement of certain children in unli-\ncensed homes, where they were not provided regular foster\ncare services. The motion also alleged that BCDSS had failed\nto  \"undertake adequate and effective measures to address\ndeficiencies  in the [foster care] system\" revealed by the\nBCDSS’s own review of its services. L.J. v. Massinga, 699 F.\nSupp. 508, 529 (D. Md. 1988) (\" L.J. III\").1 BCDSS’s review,\nwhich was conducted by a group that became known as the\nHarris Task Force, had uncovered numerous problems. These\nincluded a shortage of foster care homes, insufficient staff,\npoor training, and a general absence of adequate safeguards\n1The district court’s 1987 order on the preliminary injunction (\" L.J. I\")\nwas not included in the federal supplement nor published electronically.\nHowever, the district court’s 1988 order approving the consent decree\n(\"L.J. III\") included the text of the 1987 preliminary injunction order as\nan attachment. Therefore references in this opinion to the 1987 prelimi-\nnary injunction order will cite to the court’s 1988 published opinion in L.J.\nIII. \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 5\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 5 of 26\n4 L.J. v. WILBON\nand oversight to ensure the children’s safety. See id. at 533-34\n(detailing the findings of the Harris Task Force).\nFollowing  a two-week evidentiary hearing, the district\ncourt found that Appellees had \"offered sufficient evidence to\nestablish the existence of serious systemic deficiencies in the\nBaltimore foster care system.\"  Id. at 538. These deficiencies\nincluded \"the failure to implement policies to protect children\nin foster care; the lack of an effective effort to recruit new fos-\nter homes; the licensing of questionable homes; the granting\nof exceptions allowing homes that should be closed to remain\nopen; and the incomplete medical histories of children in fos-\nter care.\" Id. The district court noted that, although BCDSS\nhad made some efforts to respond to the problems highlighted\nby the Harris Task Force, those attempts were \"incomplete\nand ineffective.\" Id. at 534. It concluded that Appellees were\n\"likely to suffer severe physical and emotional injury\" and\nthat their \"constitutional right to protection while in defen-\ndants’ custody [was] in jeopardy.\"  Id. at 538.\nThe district court also held that Appellees had shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits on both their statutory and\nconstitutional claims. It found that, given the magnitude of the\nproblems  exposed during the hearing on the motion, \"it\nappears unlikely that defendants will be able to prove they are\nin compliance\" with their statutory duties.  Id. at 539. It also\ndetermined that \"plaintiffs have demonstrated the existence of\na ‘special relationship’ with defendants such that plaintiffs are\nowed an affirmative duty of protection by defendants\" under\nthe Due Process Clause.  Id. \nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring\nAppellants to submit a plan for review of each foster care\nhome where there had been a report of maltreatment, conduct\nfrequent visits to all foster homes, implement measures to\nimprove the medical care provided to foster children, and sub-\nmit reports of all new complaints of maltreatment to the juve-\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 6\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 6 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 5\nnile court and to Appellees’ attorney, together with reports of\nactions taken to address those complaints.  Id. at 540. \nAppellants challenged the entry of the preliminary injunc-\ntion before this court, alleging that they were immune to dam-\nage claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They argued that children\nin  foster care had no statutory rights that were privately\nenforceable.  In addition, they invoked \"the principle that\nimmunity in the performance of discretionary duties exists\nwhere the law governing official conduct is unsettled\" and\nalleged that Appellees’ constitutional rights were not \"clearly\nestablished\" in a way sufficient to overcome qualified immu-\nnity. L.J. v. Massinga, 838 F.2d 118, 122 (4th Cir. 1988)\n(\"L.J. II\"). \nThis court affirmed the entry of the preliminary injunction.\nIn  so doing, we noted that Appellants did not \"seriously\"\nargue \"with respect to prospective relief that if plaintiffs prove\ntheir allegations, which they have already demonstrated have\nan arguably solid foundation, plaintiffs will have proven a\nviolation  of their due process rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\" Id. However, we found that it was unnecessary\nto reach the issue of Appellees’ constitutional rights because\nAppellants’ \"statutory duty was clear and certain and there-\nfore they are not entitled to invoke the immunity defense.\" Id.\nWe detailed a number of statutory duties including \"main-\ntaining standards for foster family homes and child care,\" 42\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(10), \"implementation and operation of ‘a case\nreview  system’\" for each child,  id.  at §§  627(a)(2)(B),\n671(a)(16), and reporting to law enforcement any suspicion of\nabuse, neglect, or exploitation in the placement home or insti-\ntution, id. § 671(a)(9). L.J. II, 838 F.2d at 122-23. We held\nthat the \"statutory provisions spell out a standard of conduct,\nand as a corollary rights in plaintiffs, which plaintiffs have\nalleged have been denied.\"  Id. at 123. We further noted that\nalthough \"the statutes are largely statutes relating to appropri-\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 7\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 7 of 26\n6 L.J. v. WILBON\nations . . . they are privately enforceable under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.\" Id. We therefore upheld the injunction.\nFollowing our affirmance of the preliminary injunction, the\nparties engaged in six weeks of settlement negotiations. The\nnegotiations produced a proposed consent decree intended \"to\nsettle and resolve all claims for declaratory relief and equita-\nble relief, including injunctive relief.\" L.J. III, 699 F. Supp. at\n518-19. The district court described the decree as follows: \nThe  consent decree that embodies the settlement\nretains substantially those measures ordered by the\n[district] court as preliminary injunctive relief. It also\nseeks to make substantial improvements in several\naspects of the foster care system including placing\nlimits  on the number of cases a worker may be\nresponsible for, improving the system for providing\nmedical treatment to foster children, providing assis-\ntance to natural parents that would allow children to\nremain with them thereby avoiding foster care where\npossible, and providing for a continuum of appropri-\nate foster care placements including the recruitment\nof new foster homes. Different improvements are to\nbe  implemented at different times; however, all\nimprovements are to be made within two years.\nId. at 511.\nAfter a thorough review of its provisions, the district court\nfound that \"if properly implemented, the consent decree will\nresult in substantial and needed improvements in Baltimore’s\nfoster care system, and is adequate to protect the interests of\nthese plaintiffs.\" Id. at 515. As a result, it held the decree to\nbe \"fair, reasonable, adequate and deserving of approval.\"  Id.\nat 518. \nFor the first few years, Appellants’ periodic reports to the\ncourt  indicated substantial compliance with the consent\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 8\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 8 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 7\ndecree requirements.2 In 2002, however, Maryland’s Depart-\nment of Legislative Services (\"DLS\") conducted an audit of\nBCDSS foster care services and identified a number of defi-\nciencies. These included inadequate security checks for foster\nplacements, inadequate health care for the children, and no\nschool attendance records for many of the children. Appellees\nthen  conducted their own investigation, which revealed a\nnumber  of alleged inaccuracies in BCDSS’s compliance\nreports to the court. When these inaccuracies came to light,\nMaryland’s General Assembly asked DLS to address the reli-\nability of Appellants’ compliance data. DLS found that \"the\nreliability of the data underlying the reported measures tested\nwas questionable with several being judged unreliable.\" S.J.A.\n170. Following the DLS review, BCDSS began addressing a\nnumber of the reporting problems. Their subsequent reports\nshowed several areas where the decree requirements were not\nbeing met. \nOver the next few years, the number of available foster\nhomes  fell sharply. As a result, BCDSS began using its\noffices  as emergency shelters. In 2005 Appellees became\naware that Appellants were using an office building located\non Gay Street in Baltimore as an overnight shelter. Appellees’\ninvestigation  of this shelter revealed disturbing conditions,\nwith  children sleeping on the floor, unable to shower or\nchange clothes, and subsisting on a diet of fast food. The\ninvestigation  also revealed that some of the children with\nhealth problems were placed at risk by the precarious living\nconditions at the shelter.\nIn  December 2005, Appellees informed Appellants that\nthey intended to take action to address BCDSS’s lack of com-\npliance with the consent decree. In February 2006, Appellees\n2In 1991 the parties modified the consent decree to extend its applica-\ntion to foster care cases in which children were placed with family mem-\nbers. \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 9\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 9 of 26\n8  L.J. v. WILBON\nand Appellants began negotiations on potential changes to the \ndecree which continued over the next year. \nIn March 2007, Brenda Donald was appointed as the new \nsecretary of the Maryland Department of Human Resources \nand began implementing numerous reforms to the foster care \nsystem.   She  also  became  involved  in  the  consent  decree \n3\nnegotiations, and agreed to a number of measures that would \nallow Appellees’ counsel to monitor and assess the foster care \nsystem. However, she rejected Appellees’ proposal to estab-\nlish an independent monitor within the Governor’s office to \noversee  the  foster  care  system.  This  disagreement  brought \nnegotiations  to  a  standstill.  As  a  result,  Appellees  filed  a \nmemorandum with the district court detailing numerous alle-\ngations of Appellants’ noncompliance with the 1988 decree. \nThese included several examples of mistreatment of children \nin foster care as well as general allegations of inadequate \nhealth care and educational services. \nThese reforms included the implementation of the \"Place Matters\" ini-\n3\ntiative, designed to reduce the number of children in out-of-home place-\nments, increase the percentage of placement in family settings, and reduce \nthe number of children in group homes. The initiative has resulted in sig-\nnificant advances toward those goals. Secretary Donald also ordered a \ncase-by-case review of all children in BCDSS care, designed to identify \nbarriers to permanent placements for each child. \nSecretary  Donald  further  implemented  the  \"Baltimore  Rebuild\" \nprogram, designed to create substantial management capacity and leadership \nwithin BCDSS. As part of this initiative, she replaced the management team \nof BCDSS and appointed a new director, Molly McGrath. During McGrath’s \ntenure, BCDSS has increased staff, reformed staff supervision, and created a \nnumber of new specialized senior staff positions, including medical director \nand educational director. Since 2007, BCDSS has also increased the use of a \ndecision-making model that involves a foster child’s family, made reforms in \ncase-worker visits, and reduced the backlog of cases involving the termination \nof parental rights. \nAlthough Appellants highlight the progress that has resulted from these \nreforms, they do not allege that such progress has rendered the decree un-\nnecessary. \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 10\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 10 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 9\nThe district court scheduled a contempt hearing for Sep-\ntember 2008. Five days before the hearing, Appellants filed a\nreport  admitting to numerous instances of noncompliance\nwith the decree requirements, and stating: \"the analysis pro-\nvided in this report suggests several areas that need our urgent\nattention  in the immediate future.\" J.A. 419. However, it\nexpressed hope that the next report would \"show measurable\nimprovements in these critical areas.\"  Id. During the subse-\nquent  contempt hearing, Appellants approached Appellees\nand offered to negotiate a \"compliance and exit plan\" that\nwould \"require verifiable data for the showing of compliance\nand exit.\" Id. at 479. The hearing was postponed pending such\nnegotiations. \nIn June 2009, the parties reached a final agreement and\njointly moved for judicial approval. The joint motion stated\nthat the parties had \"reached a comprehensive settlement of\ntheir current disputes regarding the existing Consent Decree\nand Modification that they believe is fair, reasonable, ade-\nquate, and in the best interest of the Plaintiff class.\" Id. at 634.\nShortly  after a final agreement was reached, however,\nAppellants asked the court to allow briefing on the potential\napplicability of the Supreme Court’s then-recent decision in\nHorne v. Flores, 129 S. Ct. 2579 (2009), which they alleged\nchanged the law in a way that deprived the district court of\nsubject matter jurisdiction to enforce the 1988 decree. The\ncourt held a hearing during which it preliminarily approved\nthe 2009 decree, declaring it \"not only fair\" but also \"com-\nmendable.\" J.A. 721. During the hearing Secretary Donald\nalso described the decree as \"very strong.\"  Id. at 725. The\ncourt decided to permit briefing on the subject matter jurisdic-\ntion issue and stayed the final entry of the decree pending\nsuch briefing.\nIn September 2009, Appellants moved to vacate the 1988\ndecree under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), which\nstates that a court may vacate a judgment or an order if: \"the\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 11\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 11 of 26\n10 L.J. v. WILBON\njudgment  has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is\nbased  on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or\nvacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\"\nAppellants’ motion also opposed entry of the 2009 modified\nconsent decree. \nThe motion alleged that, in Horne, the Supreme Court held\nthat a court may not enforce a consent decree based on a stat-\nute that does not provide a private cause of action. They fur-\nther alleged that  Horne was directly applicable to this case\nbecause,  in  Suter  v. Artist M. ,  503 U.S. 347 (1992), the\nSupreme Court held that there was no private right of action\nunder AACWA. \nDuring the hearing on the motion to vacate, the district\ncourt  first rejected Appellants’ suggestion that the court\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It stated that\nthere was a \"legitimate question\" as to whether Appellees had\na right of action under Suter, and that the \"existence of a legit-\nimate question confer[s] subject matter jurisdiction upon [the\ncourt].\" J.A. 1212. Appellants then amended their jurisdic-\ntional argument, explaining: \nWe’re not saying the court lacks jurisdiction in the\nsense of the power to say what the law is. What\nwe’re saying is that the court under  Horne lacks . . .\nthe authority to order the relief requested. . . . You\nhave the jurisdiction to decide the issue.\nId. at 1217-18. \nThe court rejected Appellants’ interpretation of  Horne. It\ninstead read Horne as saying that \"it is inappropriate for a fed-\neral court to grant relief in favor of the plaintiffs [if] in fact\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that there might be\nongoing federal violations.\"  Id. at 1225. The court further\nfound that, because there remains a \"concern about violations\nof federal law,\" there is \"a continuing federal interest which\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 12\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 12 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 11\n. . . is not inappropriate for [it] to continue to enforce even if\nthese particular plaintiffs don’t have a private right of action.\"4\nId. The court denied the motion to vacate the 1988 decree and\nentered the 2009 decree. This appeal followed. \nII.\nAppellants argue that the district court erred in denying\ntheir motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5)\nto vacate the 1988 decree based on intervening changes in\ndecisional law that allegedly eliminated the legal bases for the\ndecree. They also argue that the district court erred in entering\nthe 2009 modified consent decree, because it is not based on\na valid federal claim. We address each contention in turn. \nWe review both the district court’s denial of Appellants’\nRule 60(b)(5) motion and its decision to enter the 2009 modi-\nfied consent decree for abuse of discretion.  See United States\nv. North Carolina, 180 F.3d 574, 581 (4th Cir. 1999); Werner\nv. Carbo, 731 F.2d 204, 206 (4th Cir. 1984). A district court\nabuses its discretion only where it \"has acted arbitrarily or\nirrationally[,] . . . has failed to consider judicially recognized\nfactors constraining its exercise of discretion, or when it has\nrelied on erroneous factual or legal premises.\"  United States\nv. Hedgepeth, 418 F.3d 411, 419 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal cita-\ntions and quotations omitted). \nA.\nRule 60(b)(5) provides: \nOn motion and just terms, the court may relieve a\nparty or its legal representative from a final judg-\nment [or] order . . . [if] the judgment has been satis-\nfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier\n4The court did not reach the question of whether Appellees had a private\nright of action under AACWA. \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 13\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 13 of 26\n12 L.J. v. WILBON\njudgment  that has been reversed or vacated; or\napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\nA party seeking modification of a decree as \"no longer equita-\nble\" has the \"burden of establishing that a significant change\nin circumstances warrants revision of the decree.\"  Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail , 502 U.S. 367, 383 (1992). A\nparty \"may meet its initial burden by showing either a signifi-\ncant change either in factual conditions or in law\" that makes\n\"enforcement of the decree . . . detrimental to the public inter-\nest.\" Id. at 384. \nAppellants argue that they are entitled to relief under Rule\n60(b)(5) because applying the consent degree prospectively is\nno longer equitable due to significant changes in decisional\nlaw created by Horne and Suter.5 They allege that Horne \"de-\nmonstrate[s] that the absence of a federal right enforceable\nthrough a private right of action deprives a federal court of\nauthority  to enter or enforce an injunction like the 1988\ndecree.\" Appellants’ Br. at 25. They further assert that this\nchange requires the court to vacate the decree because, under\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in  Suter, \"no private right of\naction is authorized by the statutes on which the plaintiffs\nbase their claims.\" Id. They argue, as a result, that \"no federal\nclaim supports . . . the 1988 decree\" and that the district court\nshould therefore have vacated the decree.  Id. at 30. For the\nreasons discussed below, we find that Appellants failed to\nmeet their burden of showing that  Horne and Suter created\nchanges in the law that require vacatur of the 1988 decree. 6 \n5Appellants  have never alleged that the decree should be vacated\nbecause it has been fulfilled or because it is no longer necessary. In fact,\nin September 2009, the month they filed the motion to vacate, Appellants\nreported data that showed several ongoing compliance problems. How-\never, the option of seeking to have the decree vacated on the basis of com-\npliance remains available to Appellants, and we express no opinion in that\nregard. \n6Appellants also argue that enforcement of the decree could not other-\nwise be based on alleged due process violations because \"this Court did\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 14\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 14 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 13\n1.\nHorne involved a challenge to a declaratory judgment and\nrelated injunctions entered in an action alleging that an Ari-\nzona school district was providing inadequate instruction to\nEnglish Language Learners (\"ELL\"). Plaintiffs in that action,\na group of ELL students, asserted that the district’s ELL pro-\ngram  violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of\n1974 (\"EEOA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f), which requires States to\ntake \"appropriate action to overcome language barriers\" in\nschools. Horne, 129 S. Ct. at 2588. In granting declaratory\njudgment in favor of plaintiffs, the district court found an\nEEOA violation in the school district \"because the amount of\nfunding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL stu-\ndents (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not related\nto  the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL\ninstruction.\" Id. at 2589. Six years after the judgment was\nentered,  the Arizona state legislature passed H.B. 2064,\ndesigned to increase ELL funding. The Arizona Superinten-\ndent of Public Instruction, who was a defendant, along with\nstate legislators who were permitted to intervene in the case,\nfiled a Rule 60(b)(5) motion, alleging that H.B. 2064 created\na change in circumstances that required vacatur of the original\nnot address those claims, and the 1988 decree was not based on them.\"\nAppellants’ Br. at 7 n.8. Because we find that Appellants failed to show\nthat the decrees lack a statutory basis, we need not address their claim that\nthe decree was not based on Appellees’ constitutional rights. \nWe note, however, that Appellants’ argument before the district court\nthat Appellees’ complaint did not give rise to cognizable due process\nclaims, which consisted of only one footnote in a reply brief, was insuffi-\nciently developed to establish that contention below. Furthermore, the\nfootnote relied solely on cases that we have since held do not foreclose the\nexistence of a constitutional right to protection for children in foster care.\nSee Doe v. S.C. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 597 F.3d 163, 174-75 (4th Cir. 2010)\n(distinguishing the cases cited by Appellants and holding that, under the\nDue Process Clause, states have \"a duty not to make a foster care place-\nment that is deliberately indifferent to the child’s right to personal safety\nand security\"). \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 15\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 15 of 26\n14 L.J. v. WILBON\njudgment. The district court denied the motion and the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \nThe Supreme Court reversed, holding that both the district\ncourt and the Ninth Circuit had misapplied the Rule 60(b)(5)\n\"changed circumstances\" inquiry. The Court noted that Rule\n60(b)(5)  permits relief from a judgment in three circum-\nstances: where \"[i] the judgment has been satisfied, released\nor discharged; [ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has\nbeen reversed or vacated;  or [iii] applying it prospectively is\nno longer equitable.\" Id. at 2597 (alterations in the original).\nIt held that both courts erroneously focused only on the first\ninquiry and failed to determine whether application of the\njudgment continued to be equitable. The opinion explained\nthat the equity inquiry required the courts below to analyze\n\"whether ongoing enforcement of the original order was sup-\nported by an ongoing violation of federal law,\" which they\nfailed to do. Id. The Court then pointed to \"important factual\nand legal changes that may warrant the granting of relief from\nthe judgment\" and remanded to the district court for \"a proper\nexamination\" of changed circumstances.  Id. at 2600. \nThe Horne opinion emphasized that the inquiry it described\nwas required under the \"flexible approach\" to Rule 60(b)(5)\nthat  courts have been instructed to apply when reviewing\ninstitutional  reform orders. Under that flexible approach,\ncourts are directed to \"ensure that ‘responsibility for discharg-\ning the State’s obligations is returned promptly to the State\nand its officials’ when the circumstances warrant.\" Id. at 2595\n(quoting Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 442 (2004)). Fur-\nthermore, the approach requires courts to \"remain attentive to\nthe fact that ‘federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits\nif they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not vio-\nlate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.’\"  Id.\n(quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 282 (1977)). \nAppellants argue that the district court misapplied the flexi-\nble approach described in Horne by failing to vacate a decree\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 16\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 16 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 15\nthat was no longer equitable because it did not flow from a\nviolation  of federal rights. According to Appellants, the\ndecree  does not flow from a violation of federal rights\nbecause the statute on which it is based, AACWA, does not\nprovide a private right of action. Appellants base their argu-\nment on a footnote in the  Horne opinion, which states:\n[B]oth the District Court and the Court of Appeals\nheld  that HB 2064’s funding mechanism violates\n[the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (\"NCLB\")].\n. . . Whether or not HB 2064 violates [NCLB], . . .\nneither court below was empowered to decide the\nissue.  As the Court of Appeals itself recognized,\nNCLB does not provide a private right of action. . . .\n\"Without [statutory intent], a cause of action does\nnot exist and courts may not create one, no matter\nhow desirable that might be as a policy matter, or\nhow compatible with the statute.\"  Alexander v. San-\ndoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286-287 (2001). Thus, NCLB\nis  enforceable only by the agency charged with\nadministering it. \nId. at 2598 n.6 (\"Footnote 6\") (internal citations omitted).\nAppellants argue that Footnote 6 announced the legal princi-\nple that the court is not \"‘empowered to decide the issue’ of\nthe violation of a federal statute or to order a remedy on that\nstatute where . . . the statute ‘does not provide a private cause\nof action.’\" Appellants’ Br. at 24. They claim that Footnote 6\nestablished a significant change in decisional law sufficient to\nsupport vacatur under Rule 60(b)(5). \nBecause the judgment at issue in  Horne was not based on\nalleged violations of NCLB, Footnote 6 did not relate to the\nvalidity of the judgment as a legal remedy. Rather, the foot-\nnote was a response to the holdings of the courts below con-\ncluding that, because the reforms in ELL funding through\nH.B. 2064 violated NCLB, those reforms could not render the\njudgment  unnecessary. The footnote simply explained that\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 17\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 17 of 26\n16 L.J. v. WILBON\nsuch a consideration was not appropriate because the courts\ncould not entertain private allegations of noncompliance with\nNCLB and therefore could not decide that issue. \nAlthough Appellants assert that Footnote 6 signifies a sig-\nnificant  change in the law sufficient to support a Rule\n60(b)(5) vacatur of the decree, neither Appellants’ brief nor\nAppellants’ counsel at oral argument could articulate the for-\nmer  state of the law that the  Horne  footnote allegedly\nchanged. This is likely because the proposition explained in\nFootnote 6 is hardly novel. The Supreme Court has long held\nthat private plaintiffs may not bring suits to enforce statutes\nthat do not provide a private cause of action. In fact, the case\ncited in Footnote 6,  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275\n(2001),  stands for that very proposition by holding that a\nplaintiff cannot bring a disparate impact claim under §  602 of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the Act does\nnot provide a private right of action for such claim.  See also\nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 276 (2002) (holding that\na private plaintiff may not being an action under the Family\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 because that stat-\nute does not create personal rights to enforce under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983). Footnote 6 simply explains that the courts below\ncould not base their decisions on private allegations of non-\ncompliance with NCLB because the private plaintiffs lacked\na cause of action to bring a noncompliance challenge. \nAppellants urge us to extend the narrow legal proposition\ncontained in Footnote 6 to find that a court can retroactively\nlose authority to enforce a decree if that decree is based on a\nstatute that the Supreme Court later finds not to provide a pri-\nvate cause of action. Given that Footnote 6 did not address\neither the actual statute upon which the judgment in the case\nwas based or the court’s continuing authority to enforce it,\nsuch a holding would require a significant logical leap unsup-\nported by the footnote’s sparse language. Accordingly, we\nfind that Horne did not establish a change in the law sufficient\nto support Appellants’ 60(b)(5) motion. At most,  Horne rein-\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 18\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 18 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 17\nforced  the well-established principle that private plaintiffs\ncannot bring a claim to enforce a statute that lacks a private\nright of action. \n2.\nFurthermore, even if we were to accept Appellants’ reading\nof  Footnote 6, their argument would nonetheless remain\nunavailing  for other reasons. Appellants allege that, under\nFootnote 6, the district court here lacks authority to enforce\nthe decree because, pursuant to the Supreme Court’s ruling in\nSuter,  Appellees lack a private right of action to enforce\nAACWA. We first note that  Suter was issued eighteen years\nago. Rule 60(c) requires that a motion for relief under Rule\n60(b)(5) be \"made within a reasonable time.\" Therefore, even\nif  Suter  had indeed changed the law, Appellants’ lengthy\ndelay in filing a motion based upon it would bring into ques-\ntion the appropriateness of equitable relief. \nPerhaps more importantly, Appellants have failed to meet\nthe burden of showing that this court’s decision in  L.J. II has\nbeen overruled by Suter. Our holding in L.J. II that Appellees\nhad a private right of action to enforce the relevant provisions\nof AACWA is \"the law of the case\" and is therefore presump-\ntively controlling, absent proof to the contrary:\nThe law of the case doctrine posits that when a court\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should con-\ntinue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages\nin the same case. As a practical matter, then, once\nthe decision of an appellate court establishes the law\nof the case, it must be followed in all subsequent\nproceedings in the same case in the trial court or on\na later appeal . . . unless: (1) a subsequent trial pro-\nduces substantially different evidence, (2) control-\nling authority has since made a contrary decision of\nlaw applicable to the issue, or (3) the prior decision\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 19\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 19 of 26\n18 L.J. v. WILBON\nwas  clearly erroneous and would work manifest\ninjustice. \nTFWS, Inc. v. Franchot , 572 F.3d 186, 191 (4th Cir. 2009)\n(internal quotations and citations omitted). Appellants appear\nto rely on the second prong of this analysis in arguing that\nSuter  \"made a contrary decision of law\" by holding that\nAACWA is \"unenforceable by foster children in a private\nright  of action.\" Appellants’ Br. 29. We decline to adopt\nAppellants’ broad reading of  Suter. \nAACWA \"establishes a federal reimbursement program for\ncertain expenses incurred by the States in administering foster\ncare and adoption services.\" Suter, 503 U.S. at 350-51. Under\nthe Act, a state can be \"reimbursed for a percentage of foster\ncare and adoption assistance payments when the State satis-\nfies the requirements of the Act.\"  Id. at 351.  Suter involved\nallegations that the Illinois Department of Children and Fam-\nily Services had violated AACWA’s requirements. The spe-\ncific  question before the Court was whether the Seventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals had erred in holding \"that 42 U.S.C.\n§ 671(a)(15) contained an implied right of action, and that\n[the plaintiffs] could enforce this section of the Act through\nan action brought under § 1983 as well.\" Id. at 350. Suter did\nnot address the broader question of whether AACWA as a\nwhole lacked a private right of action. \nSection 671, as it existed at the time of Suter, stated in rele-\nvant part: \n(a) Requisite features of State plan[.] In order for a\nState to be eligible for payments under this part, it\nshall have a plan approved by the Secretary which\n. . . (15) . . . provides that, in each case, reasonable\nefforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a\nchild in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need\nfor removal of the child from his home, and (B) to\nmake it possible for the child to return to his home.\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 20\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 20 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 19\nId. at 351.7 The Suter court found that, because there were no\nconcrete requirements and no statutory guidance within the\nAACWA \"as to how ‘reasonable efforts’ are to be measured,\"\nthe section was too vague for private enforcement.  Suter, 503\nU.S. at 360. The Court also noted that the Act provided mech-\nanisms for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to\nenforce the provision, and therefore \"absence of a remedy to\nprivate plaintiffs under § 1983 does not make the ‘reasonable\nefforts’ clause a dead letter.\"  Id. at 360-61. In addition, the\nCourt found that although \"the Act does place a requirement\non the States, . . . that requirement only goes so far as to\nensure that the State have a plan approved by the Secretary\nwhich contains the . . . listed features.\"  Id. at 358.\nAlthough not directly at issue in the case before it, the Suter\nCourt also found in a footnote that the other provision on\nwhich the plaintiffs had originally based their complaint, 42\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(9), lacked a private right of action. The court\nnoted  that the provision, which mandates reporting to the\nauthorities of \"unsuitable homes,\" \"is merely another feature\nwhich the state plan must include to be approved by the Sec-\n7The current language is slightly different, although the differences are\nnot substantive. The current language states: \n  In order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part\n[42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.], it shall have a plan approved by the\nSecretary which . . . \n  (15) provides that— \n  (A) in determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect\nto a child, as described in this paragraph, and in making such rea-\nsonable efforts, the child’s health and safety shall be the para-\nmount concern; \n  (B) except as provided in subparagraph (D), reasonable efforts\nshall be made to preserve and reunify families—(i) prior to the\nplacement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the\nneed for removing the child from the child’s home; and (ii) to\nmake it possible for a child to safely return to the child’s home.\n42 U.S.C. § 671. \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 21\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 21 of 26\n20 L.J. v. WILBON\nretary\" and \"does not afford a cause of action to the respon-\ndents anymore than does the ‘reasonable efforts’ clause of\n§ 671(a)(15).\" Suter, 503 U.S. at 359 n.10. \nFollowing  the issuance of the  Suter  decision, Congress\npassed a law invalidating the Supreme Court’s rationale relat-\ning to the existence of a state plan. The provision states, in\npart:\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of the\nSocial Security Act [42 U.S.C. §  301 et seq.], such\nprovision is not to be deemed unenforceable because\nof its inclusion in a section of the Act requiring a\nState plan or specifying the required contents of a\nState plan. This section is not intended to limit or\nexpand the grounds for determining the availability\nof private actions to enforce State plan requirements\nother than by overturning any such grounds applied\nin Suter v. Artist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 . . . [T]his sec-\ntion is not intended to alter the holding in  Suter v.\nArtist  M.  that section 471(a)(15) of the Act [42\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(15)] is not enforceable in a private\nright of action.\n42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2. Therefore, although Congress did not\noverrule Suter, see White by White v. Chambliss , 112 F.3d\n731, 739 n.4 (4th Cir. 1997), it made clear that the inclusion\nof a requirement as part of a state plan was not sufficient to\nrender that requirement unenforceable by private action. \nAppellants’ argument that Suter stands for the proposition\nthat no AACWA provisions are enforceable by a private party\nis unavailing. Whether a plaintiff has a right to bring an action\nunder a particular provision of AACWA requires a section-\nspecific inquiry. See Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 342\n(1997) (\"[I]t is impossible to determine whether Title IV-D,\nas an undifferentiated whole, gives rise to undefined ‘rights.’\nOnly when the complaint is broken down into manageable\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 22\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 22 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 21\nanalytic  bites can a court ascertain whether each separate\nclaim satisfies the various criteria we have set forth for deter-\nmining whether a federal statute creates rights.\"). The fact that\nSuter found no private right of action under §  671(a)(15) and\n§ 671(a)(9) does not void our holding in  L.J. II that the rights\nasserted by plaintiffs under § 671(a)(16) are privately enforce-\nable under 42 U.S.C. §  1983.8 See L.J. II, 838 F.2d at 123.\nSection 671(a)(16) provides that the state:\nshall have a plan approved by the Secretary which\n. . . provides for the development of a case plan (as\ndefined in . . . [42 U.S.C. §  675(1)]) for each child\nreceiving foster care maintenance payments under\nthe State plan and provides for a case review system\nwhich meets the requirements described in . . . [42\nU.S.C. § 675(5)(B)] with respect to each such child.\nSections  675(1) and 675(5)(B), in turn, provide concrete\nrequirements for the content and timing of the case plans and\ncase review systems. \nAppellants argue that this \"lone provision cannot support\n. . . the wide-ranging and prescriptive provisions of either the\n1988 or the 2009 injunction.\" Appellants’ Reply Br. 19. How-\never, it is well established that \"parties may agree to provi-\nsions in a consent decree which exceed the requirements of\nfederal law.\" Suter, 503 U.S. at 354 n.6 (citing Rufo, 502 U.S.\nat 389). Appellants provide no legal support for the contention\nthat a court cannot enforce a consent decree unless each and\nevery statutory provision listed in the plaintiffs’ complaint\ncreates a private right of action. We therefore find their con-\ntention unpersuasive. \n8L.J. II also relied on § 671(a)(10), which we have since held not to pro-\nvide a private cause of action. White by White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731,\n739 (4th Cir. 1997). It further cited § 627(a)(2)(B), which is no longer part\nof  the statute. Section 627(a)(2)(B) simply mirrored the case review\nrequirement set out in § 671(a)(16). \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 23\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 23 of 26\n22 L.J. v. WILBON\nEven  under their own reading of  Horne’s  Footnote 6,\nAppellants have not shown that vacatur was required. They\nhave failed to establish that  Suter forecloses a private plain-\ntiff’s  ability to bring an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 671(a)(16).9  Accordingly, we cannot say that the court\nabused its discretion in denying Appellants’ motion to vacate\nthe 1988 decree.10 \nB.\nAppellants also assert that the district court erred in enter-\ning the 2009 modified consent decree, to which they ulti-\nmately objected, because the decree lacked a valid legal basis1.1\nAppellants argue that the changes created by Suter and Horne\neliminated the statutory right of action upon which the 2009\nconsent decree was based. \n9Appellants argue that we must reverse the district court’s holding\nbecause it was based on the allegedly erroneous finding that, because there\nwas \"a continuing federal interest\" in this case, it could \"continue to\nenforce even if these particular plaintiffs don’t have a private right of\naction.\" J.A. 1225. However, because we find that Appellants’ failure to\nmeet their burden on their Rule 60(b)(5) motion justifies the denial of the\nmotion, we need not reach that finding. In affirming the holding of the dis-\ntrict court, \"[w]e are not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by\nthe district court to support its decision, but may affirm on any grounds\napparent from the record.\" United States v. Smith, 395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th\nCir. 2005) (citation omitted). \n10This holding does not, of course, foreclose the possibility that Appel-\nlants may file other Rule 60(b)(5) motions. As we noted earlier, for exam-\nple, if in the future they wish to establish that the decree has been satisfied\nand is no longer necessary, that avenue remains open to them. \n11We note that the fact that Appellants ultimately opposed the entry of\nthe 2009 decree bears no significance for, as we have held \"a party’s\nchange of heart regarding a settlement is not a valid basis upon which to\nrefuse approval.\" United States v. North Carolina, 180 F.3d 574, 582 (4th\nCir. 1999); see also Petty v. Timken Corp., 849 F.2d 130, 133 (4th Cir.\n1988) (\"[S]econd thoughts . . . do[] not . . . establish unfairness or justify\nsetting aside an otherwise valid [settlement] agreement.\"). \n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 24\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 24 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 23\nWe have held that before entering a consent decree \"the\ncourt must satisfy itself that the agreement ‘is fair, adequate,\nand reasonable’ and ‘is not illegal, a product of collusion, or\nagainst the public interest.’\" North Carolina, 180 F.3d at 581.\nHere, Appellants made no objection to the fairness or reason-\nableness of the decree provisions themselves. Rather, they\nfocused only on the legal basis of the claims upon which the\ndecree rested. During the hearing on the merits of the decree,\nthe court found that the decree \"is not only fair, [but] com-\nmendable\" and it \"commend[ed] all sides for having worked\nto achieve it.\" J.A. 721. The court further noted that \"but for\nthe  [Horne]  subject matter jurisdiction issue, [it] certainly\nwould approve the decree.\"  Id.\nAppellants  do not now challenge the court’s holding\nregarding the merits of the decree. Instead, they argue that the\ncourt abused its discretion by failing to \"ensure that there\n[was]  a substantial federal claim\" supporting the decree.\nAppellants’ Br. 26 (citing  Evans v. City of Chicago , 10 F.3d\n474, 479 (7th Cir. 1993)). As explained above, this court’s\nholding  that Appellees had a valid cause of action under\nAACWA is \"the law of the case,\" and, as such, the district\ncourt is entitled to follow it absent proof that it has been over-\nruled or that it is clearly erroneous. As we have previously\ndiscussed, Appellants failed to establish that the holding in\nL.J. II that 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16) provided a private cause of\naction was overruled by  Suter. Nor did they establish below\nthat the finding was clearly erroneous. \nWe have held that a prior decision does not qualify for the\n\"clearly erroneous\" exception to the \"law of the case\" doctrine\n\"by being ‘just maybe or probably wrong; it must . . . strike\nus as wrong with the force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated\ndead fish.’\" Franchot, 572 F.3d at 194 (citation omitted). In\nother words, it must be \"dead wrong.\"  Id. Here, Appellants\nfailed to show that this court’s previous conclusion that 42\nU.S.C. § 671(a)(16) provided a private cause of action was\n\"dead wrong.\" Indeed, in their briefing to the district court,\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 25\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 25 of 26\n24 L.J. v. WILBON\nAppellants  made no attempt to analyze the language of\n§ 671(a)(16) to establish that it clearly did not create a private\nright of action. Had they done so, they would have had to con-\ntend with the fact that we have previously found a similar pro-\nvision to create a private right of action. \nIn Pee Dee Health Care, P.A. v. Sanford, 509 F.3d 204 (4th\nCir. 2007), we analyzed a statute that, like AACWA, required\nstates to implement a state plan in order to receive federal\nfunding. The plaintiffs in that case were rural health clinics\nthat alleged that South Carolina’s state Medicaid plan, which\nthe state was required to implement in order to receive federal\nMedicaid  reimbursements, failed to comply with federal\nrequirements.  In particular, they claimed violations of 42\nU.S.C. § 1396a(bb), which states: \"[T]he State plan shall pro-\nvide for payment for services . . . furnished by a Federally-\nqualified health center and services . . . furnished by a rural\nhealth clinic in accordance with the provisions of this subsec-\ntion.\" \nThe Pee Dee court first noted that, under  Blessing v. Free-\nstone:\n[a] statute creates an enforceable right if: (1) Con-\ngress intended that the provision in question benefit\nthe plaintiff; (2) the right ostensibly protected by the\nstatute  ‘is not so vague and amorphous that its\nenforcement would strain judicial competence’; and\n(3)  the statute unambiguously imposes a binding\nobligation on the states. \nPee Dee, 509 F.3d at 210 (citing  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-\n41). It then found that the section created a private right of\naction in the rural clinics because the words \"shall provide for\npayment for services . . . furnished by a rural health clinic\"\nshowed that \"Congress intended the statute to benefit\" those\nclinics. Id. at 212. We also found that \"the use of ‘shall pro-\nvide for payment’ is not unduly vague or amorphous such that\n\nCase: 09-2259     Document: 83      Date Filed: 02/08/2011      Page: 26\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 606   Filed 02/08/11   Page 26 of 26\nL.J. v. WILBON 25\nthe judiciary cannot enforce it.\"  Id. Finally, the court found\nthat \"the language unambiguously binds the states as indi-\ncated by the repeated use of ‘shall.’\"  Id.\nGiven our analysis in  Pee Dee, we cannot say that this\ncourt’s prior finding that §  671(a)(16) creates a private right\nof action is \"dead wrong.\" The section dictates that a state \nshall have a plan approved by the Secretary which\n. . . provides for the development of a case plan (as\ndefined in . . . [42 U.S.C. §  675(1)]) for each child\nreceiving foster care maintenance payments under\nthe State plan and provides for a case review system\nwhich meets the requirements described in section\n. . . [42 U.S.C. §  675(5)(B)] with respect to  each\nsuch child. \n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16) (emphasis added). This court’s analy-\nsis in Pee Dee could arguably support a finding that the lan-\nguage of § 671(a)(16) clearly intends to benefit \"each child\"\nin foster care; that the plan and review requirements are not\n\"so vague or amorphous\" such that the judiciary could not\nenforce them; and that the \"shall\" language clearly binds the\nstate. See Pee Dee, 509 F.3d at 210;  see also Blessing, 520\nU.S. at 340-41. Appellants have simply failed to show that\nsuch  holding would be \"dead wrong\" under the  Blessing\nframework.\nTo be clear, we do not now hold that §  671(a)(16) provides\na  private right of action. We simply hold that Appellants\nfailed to show that the \"law of the case\" to that effect estab-\nlished by L.J. II was overruled or \"dead wrong.\" Accordingly,\nAppellants cannot show that the district court abused its dis-\ncretion by entering the 2009 decree, which was based on that\nprovision. \nIII.\nFor the reasons stated above, we \nAFFIRM.",

Frederick Motz\nUnited States District Court\n  For the District of Maryland\n101 West Lombard Street\nBaltimore, MD 21201\nRe:  L.J. v. Massinga; Civil No. JFM-84-4409\nDear Judge Motz:\nThis letter responds to your letter dated February 27, 2007, in which you request a status\nreport on the outstanding issues in the above-referenced matter.\nSince counsel last spoke with the Court, plaintiffs’ counsel forwarded a letter to\ndefendants’ counsel on April 9, 2007, informing the defendants that they intended to proceed\nwith plans to file for a motion for contempt.  The defendants were surprised and disappointed\nbecause we believed that substantial collaboration and efforts were underway.  \nPrior to April 9, 2007, counsel had engaged in communications and participated in\nmeetings and a mediation session with Secretary Brenda Donald and Director Samuel Chambers,\nJr. in the hope of reaching a consensus on issues related to the PIA, access issues, a monitor,\nattorneys’ fees and healthcare.\nSecretary Donald assumed leadership of DHR a little more than two months ago.  Since\nthat time she has made clear her intention to be open and transparent in addressing the issues\nfacing the foster care system in Baltimore City, and she believes that she has embarked swiftly on\na course of action that will move the Department and BCDSS in the right direction.  Since taking\nthe helm at DHR, Secretary Donald has taken a hands-on approach to the L.J. Consent Decree. \n\nLetter to CThaes eH o1n:8o4ra-bclve- 0J.4 F4r0e9de-JriFcMk M   oDtozcument 448   Filed 04/13/07   Page 2 of 3\nApril 13, 2007\nPage 2\nShe immediately convened an L.J. workgroup to develop an implementation plan that would\ninclude benchmarks and strategies.  The Secretary personally chairs the meetings, directs\nassignments and enforces deadlines.  The Director of BCDSS and his senior staff, representatives\nfrom DHR Central, and SSA continue to develop, evaluate and refine the plan.  The first\nworkgroup meeting occurred on March 2, 2007 and meetings continue bi-weekly.  In addition,\nthe Secretary immediately met with plaintiffs’ counsel to discuss her goals and priorities in\nregard to L.J. and to provide counsel the opportunity to give feedback and recommendations.  At\nthe conclusion of the meeting, the parties agreed to schedule a mediation session on outstanding\nissues.\nAt the same time, Mr. Chambers convened an internal workgroup.  This workgroup acts\nas an internal monitor within BCDSS to address compliance issues.  As a result of this effort,\nBCDSS has developed the L.J. STAT accountability system that utilizes real time data to make\ndecisions related to the consent decree.\nOn March 13, 2007, Secretary Donald, Director Chambers and counsel participated in a\nmediation session on outstanding issues.  The Secretary committed DHR to, among other things,\nproviding certain management reports on a monthly basis without the need for a Public\nInformation Act request.  In addition, absent agreement on an expanded court monitor, the\nSecretary promised to permit plaintiffs’ counsel to sit in on the Quality Assurance process for\ncase reviews.  Moreover, DHR agreed to move forward with the development of an\nombudsman’s office within BCDSS to focus on child welfare and foster care issues.  Finally, the\nSecretary clearly expressed her interest in developing an implementation plan with enforceable\nbenchmarks.  In that regard, she agreed to explore options regarding the plan and the use of a\nmonitor with the Governor’s office.\nOn March 28, 2007, counsel, Mr. Chambers, and a DHR representative met to discuss\nhealth care issues.  After a very productive meeting, we agreed to promptly convene a health care\nadvisory group for a limited period of time to obtain input from expert sources so that DHR can\ndevelop the best health care model available within the fiscal constraints of the State.  Secretary\nDonald has conferred with DHMH Secretary John Colmers, who has agreed to co-chair the\n“kick-off” meeting of the advisory group.  \nWe believe that in the short time that the Secretary has been in office she has moved\nquickly to focus the Department’s efforts towards improving outcomes for our children.  The\nDepartment intends to continue to move forward with the initiatives it has begun in the past few\nmonths.  We have invited the plaintiffs to participate in the development of enforceable\nbenchmarks, and believe that the parties can effectively utilize the existing court monitor order. \nFinally, I would like to bring to your attention a few unresolved issues that counsel\ncontinues to work on together.  First, we have been in discussion regarding defendants’ proposed\nprotective order for the disclosure of certain records that will permit the defendants to release\nrecords without redaction.  We have agreed to continue our discussions on the proposed order\nnext week.  In regards to attorneys’ fees, on April 10, 2007, plaintiffs’ counsel rejected the\n\nLetter to CThaes eH o1n:8o4ra-bclve- 0J.4 F4r0e9de-JriFcMk M   oDtozcument 448   Filed 04/13/07   Page 3 of 3\nApril 13, 2007\nPage 3\ndefendants’ offer and intends to proceed with plans to file a fee petition.  On April 11, 2007, the\ndefendants requested detailed billing reports to assist defendants’ counsel in making an informed\nrecommendation regarding the possibility of a higher offer.  We expect that plaintiffs’ counsel\nwill be responding after they have had the opportunity to review and discuss our request.  The\nremaining issue relates to our intention to file a motion to enter the appearance of Assistant\nAttorney General Carol Smith, a former attorney for the Legal Aid Bureau, as co-counsel for the\ndefendants.  On March 15, 2007, Catherine Shultz notified the plaintiffs’ counsel of our proposal\nto do so and sought their agreement.  On March 23, 2007, plaintiffs’ counsel, citing Rule 1.9(a),\nstated that the defendants would need to file a motion requesting the Court’s approval.  We are\npreparing to file a motion.\nWe appreciate your ongoing consideration in this matter.\nSincerely,\n/s/\nMillicent Edwards Gordon\nCounsel for Defendants\ncc: David E.

Enforce its Orders of September 27,  1988 (Dkt. 219) and December 12,  1991 \n(Dkt. 301); \nB.  Issue an Order for Defendants to Show Cause why they should not be held in \ncontempt for their failure to comply with those Orders of September 27, 1988 and \nDecember 12, 1991; \nC.  Modify the Court's Orders of September 27, 1988 and December 12, 1991 as set \nforth below and in the Show Cause Memorandum; and \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 477   Filed 11/05/07   Page 2 of 35\nD.  Modify the Court's \"monitoring\" Order of May 2,  1989 (Dkt. 255) as set forth \nbelow and in the Show Cause Memorandum. \nFor cause, Plaintiffs state the following grounds: \n1.  Plaintiffs brought this class action lawsuit in 1984.  In April  1987, the Court \nentered a preliminary injunction against Defendants, finding serious deficiencies in the BCDSS \nfoster care system. \n2.  Following  the  Fourth  Circuit's  affirmance  of this  Court's ruling,  see  L.J.  v. \nMassinga, 838 F.2d 118 (4th Cir.  1988), the parties negotiated a comprehensive settlement of \nPlaintiffs'  claims  for  injunctive  relief which  incorporated  and  built  upon  the  preliminary \ninjunction. \n3.  On  September 27,  1988, this Court approved the terms  of the settlement and \nincorporated them as a consent order (\"Consent Decree\" or \"CD\"). \n4.  On  December  12,  1991,  this  Court  entered  a  second  consent  order  (the \n\"Modification\" or \"Mod.\")  extending most of the  Consent Decree  protection to  children in \nBCDSS custody and placed by BCDSS in unlicensed placements with relatives (\"kinship care\"). \n5.  Under the Consent Decree, Defendants are required to  file  semiannual reports \ndetailing \"the steps they have taken to achieve compliance with this Decree\" and providing \ncertain mandatory items of data.\"  (Consent Decree ~ 33).  Defendants must continue to file these \nsemiannual reports \"until they file a final report showing implementation of and compliance with \nthis Decree.\"  Id. ~ 34. \n6.  The Consent Decree expressly provides that the Court will retain jurisdiction until \nits terms \"are fully implemented for the purposes of (i) assuring implementation and (ii) allowing \n-2-\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 477   Filed 11/05/07   Page 3 of 35\nany  party to  apply...  for  an  order  seeking  interpretation,  implementation,  enforcement,  or \nmodification.\" Id. ~ 40. \n7.  Defendants did not reach compliance within the August 1990 deadline set by the \nConsent Decree or the March 1992 deadline set by the Modification and still have not reached \ncompliance as of the filing of this Petition.  They currently are not in compliance with the vast \nmajority of Consent Decree and Modification provisions. \n8.  On or about May 2, 1989, this Court entered a Stipulation and Order appointing a \nMonitor to resolve disputes between the parties.  The Monitor serves as a mediator with authority \nonly  to  resolve  disputes  between  the  parties,  not  to  independently  investigate  and  verify \nDefendants' assertions of compliance or Plaintiffs' assertions of non-compliance. \n9.  Defendants' failure to reach compliance with the Consent Decree nineteen years \nafter its effective date requires the appointment of a Monitor with true independent monitoring \nand reporting authority. \n10.  When the Court approved the Consent Decree in 1988, it warned Defendants that \nif they could not comply with the Consent Decree by complying with the maximum caseload \nratios set forth in the  Consent Decree, the Court would lower those requirements to  a level \nsufficient to ensure compliance.  Since then, both the Child Welfare League of America, which \nhad  established  the  standards  for  caseloads  that  are  set  forth  in  the  Consent  Decree,  and \nMaryland  law,  have  required much  lower caseloads  constituting a 40% reduction  from  the \ncurrent maximum caseload ratios. \n11.  Defendants have failed to provide the Court and Plaintiffs with accurate reports of \ntheir compliance with the Consent Decree and Modification.  The Department of Legislative \n-3-\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 477   Filed 11/05/07   Page 4 of 35\nServices (\"DLS\") has detennined that a majority of the data categories in the compliance reports \nthat DLS tested are unreliable and understate the actual levels of violations.  Plaintiffs have \nfound numerous other problems with these data as well. \n12.  As  set  forth  below  and  in  the  Show  Cause  Memorandum,  Defendants  are \nviolating most provisions of the Consent Decree and Modification. \n13.  Violation  1:  Contrary to  the requirements  of CD ~ 9 that Defendants \"shall \nestablish and maintain a continuum of foster care placements reasonably calculated to ensure that \nthere are appropriate foster care placements for all children who come into care,\" Defendants fail \nto establish and maintain a continuum of adequate placements to ensure that there are appropriate \nfoster care placements for all children who come into care. \n14.

Violation 3:  Contrary to the requirements of CD ~ 9 that Defendants \"shall \nestablish and maintain a continuum of foster care placements reasonably calculated to ensure that \nthere are appropriate foster care placements for all children who come into care[,]\"  Defendants \nmake excessive and inappropriate use of congregate care placements for children who should be \nplaced in foster homes. \n16.

Violation 11:  Contrary to the requirements of (i) CD ~ 9 that Defendants \"shall \nseek annually sufficient funds through their budget requests or elsewhere ... to purchase special \nservices for children in foster care needed to preventtheir institutionalization\"; (ii) CD ~ 9 that \nDefendants  \"shall  establish and  maintain  a continuum  of foster  care  placements  reasonably \ncalculated to ensure that there are appropriate foster care placements for all children who come \ninto care\"; (iii) Mod. ~ 16 that \"Defendants shall seek through the budget process funds for the \npurchase of special services to prevent the removal of children from relative placements, to \npromote reunification andlor to prevent a child's institutionalization\"; and (iv) Mod. ~ 14 that \n\"DSS shall assist relative caretakers, promptly and as needed, in obtaining those services that \nmay be needed to assist their families, such as day care[,]\" Defendants do not provide child care \nassistance needed by children's actual or prospective caregivers to care for the children. \n24.  Violation 12:  Contrary to the requirements of (i) CD ~ 9 that Defendants \"shall \nseek annually sufficient funds through their budget requests or elsewhere ... to purchase special \nservices for children in foster care needed to prevent their institutionalization\"; (ii) Mod. ~ 16 \n-6-\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 477   Filed 11/05/07   Page 7 of 35\nthat \"Defendants shall seek through the budget process funds for the purchase of special services \nto prevent the removal of children from relative placements, to promote reunification and/or to \nprevent  a  child's  institutionalization\";  and  (iii)  Mod.  ~ 14  that  \"DSS  shall  assist  relative \ncaretakers, promptly and as needed, in obtaining those services that may be needed to assist their \nfamilies, such as day care[,]\" Defendants provide insufficient support for caregivers. \n25.  Violation 13:  Contrary to the requirements of CD ~ 9 that Defendants \"shall seek \nannually sufficient funds through their budget requests or elsewhere  ... to assure stipends to \nemergency  shelter  care  homes  even  in months  in  which  no  children are  being  cared for,\" \nDefendants fail to provide funding for emergency foster homes. \n26.  Violation 14:  Contrary to the requirements of CD ~ 10 that Defendants \"shall \ncontinue their past practice  of seeking through the  budget process increases  in the  rate  of \nreimbursement paid to foster families by including such increases in their budget requests and \nadvocating for their appropriation with the goal of reaching by State Fiscal Year 1991 a rate of \nno less than the amount determined by the United States Department of Agriculture as necessary \nto care adequately for children in urban areas of the southern region of the country,\" Defendants \nfail to maintain foster home subsidies at USDA levels for raising a child. \n27.  Violation 15:  Contrary to the requirements of CD ~ 11  that \"Defendants shall \nmaintain a foster home recruitment unit in DSS [that] shall develop and implement a sustained \nrecruitment plan,\" Defendants have not developed or implemented a viable sustained recruitment \nplan. \n28.

For the reasons set forth below, \nthe parties respectfully request that the Court  (1) grant preliminary approval of the proposed \nModified  Consent Decree, which is appended  to  this M emorandum  as Attach ment  A; (2)  \napproval of the process set forth in a proposed  order for providing notice to the class and other \ninterested parties of the proposed Modified Consent Decree and a fairness hearing scheduled for \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 2 of 21\n \nAugust 5, 2009 at 9:00 a.m .; and (3) to grant fina l approval of the proposed Modified Consent \nDecree after the conclusion of the fairness hearing. \nI.   Factual Background. \n  Plaintiffs in this action  are the certified class of all  children and youth placed  in the \ncustody of BCDSS.  Se e L.J. v. Massinga, 699 F .Supp. 508, 510 (D. Md. 1988) (“L.J. I ”), as \nmodified, 778 F. Supp. 253 (1991) (“L.J. II ”).  Defendants are DHR and BCDSS.  The action \nwas filed in Dece mber 1984 seeking, inter  alia, orders requiring Defendants to meet certain \nneeds of Plaintiffs while in BCDSS custody, incl uding certain protections against maltreatment \nof children in foster homes and other protections for their welfare.  Following a trial of Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction, this Court’s grant of a preliminary injunction, and affirmance \nby the Fourth Circuit, the parties settled Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief by \nagreeing to a decree (the orig inal “Consent Decree”), effective August 1988, wi th the final \napproval of the Court in September 1988.  See L.J. I, 699 F. Supp. at 518 (setting forth terms of \nthe Consent Decree).  The original Consent Decree left open for furt her study and possible \nlitigation issues involving children in BCDSS  custody placed with unlicensed relatives.  The  \nparties  then  settled th ose  claims  for declar atory  and injunctive relief by agreeing to a \nmodification  of the original Consent Decree that, in ter  alia,  provided m ost  of the sam e \nprotections to Plaintiffs placed  in unlicensed relative homes.  In December 1991, the Court \napproved this modification (the “Modification”) to the original Consent Decree.  See L.J. II, 778 \nF. Supp. at 527.  Both the original Consent Decree, as modified, and the Modification still are in \neffect.   \n  2\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 3 of 21\n \n  In  May 1989, the Court entered an orde r  calling for a “m onitor”  of De fendants’ \nimplementation of the Consent D ecree, to conduct dispute resolu tion.  George Beall, Esq. was \nappointed as monitor and remained in this position until he resigned in 2007.  No new monitor \nwas appointed.  In Decem ber 2005, the Court entere d certain orders to facilitate monitoring of \nDefendants’ utilization of a  BCDSS office facility lo cated on Gay Street, Baltimore (“Gay \nStreet”) to house some Plaintiffs overnight.   \n  In November 2007, Plaintiffs filed a Petiti on for Orders of Enforce ment and to Show \nCause Why Defendants Should Not Be Held in C ontempt of Consent Decree, and Motions to \nModify Consent Decree and Monitoring Order (the “Petition”).  Defendants filed a Response on \nMarch 14, 2008, and, on July 24, 2008, Plaintiffs filed a Reply Mem orandum.  After the \ncommencement of a hearing on the Petition on  September 9, 2008, but before the Court heard \narguments on the Petition, the parties requested leave to negotiate a new agreement addressing \nthe  terms  for com pliance  and exit.  The Cour t  approved the request and adm inistratively \ndismissed the Petition so that it could be held in abeyance pending the negotiations. \n  From October 2008 through May 2009, the part ies engaged in negotiations with the \nassistance of mediators Judith Meltzer and Kathleen Noonan.  As a result of those negotiations, \nthe parties have agreed to the proposed Modified Consent Decree. \nII.   Summary of the Proposed Modified Consent Decree. \n  If approved by the Court, the proposed Modi fied Consent Decree will replace the 1988 \nConsent Decree, the 1991 Modifi cation, the 1989 Order Appointing  a Monitor, and all Orders \nrelating to Gay Street.  It addresses all of the substantive issues discussed in those orders (family \npreservation, permanency planning, placements, safety, health, education, and workforce issues) \n  3\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 4 of 21\n \nand sets forth more specific outcomes, definitions, internal success measures, and exit standards.  \nIn general, it follows the approa ch used in more recent foster care consent decrees approved in \nother  jurisdictions,  some  of whi ch  have led  to  successful  resolution  of those cases an d \ntermination of federal jurisdiction.  It incl udes specific terms and standards upon which the \nDefendants will be deemed to be in compliance and allowed to terminate the Consent Decree and \nexit from active supervision by this Court.   \n  Under the proposed Modified Consent Decr ee, Defendants will hire an Independent \nVerification Agent, Dr. Mark Testa, the Director of the Children and Family Research Center at \nthe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  A copy of Dr. Testa’s website bio is attached as \nAttachment B.  Dr. Testa will exam ine Defendants’ compliance data, certify those data that are \naccurate and reliable, and, where he deems necessary, conduct additional information-gathering \nactivities  to  measure  compliance  accurately.   Fu rthermore,  the prop osed  Modified  Consent \nDecree requires the parties to utilize a variety of resolution procedures to facilitate compliance \nand resolve disputes without resort to the Court. \n  The proposed Modified Consent Decree is divided into tw o parts.  Part One includes \ngeneral  sections governing jurisdiction, the scop e  and effe ct  of the agreem ent,  compliance \nreporting by Defendants, verification of Defendants’ compliance data, information sharing with \nPlaintiffs’ counsel, procedures  for dispute resolution and probl em-solving by the parties, and \ntermination of the Modified Consent Decree.  The  rights of the Plaintiffs and obligations of the  \nDefendants are set out in Part Tw o, which is di vided into five sections, “Preservation and \nPermanency  Planning,”  “Out-of-Home  Placements,”  “Health Care,” “Education,” and \n“Workforce.”   \n  4\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 5 of 21\n \n  A general summary of these provisions follows.   \nA.   Part  One (general provisions) o f  the proposed Modified Consent \nDecree.             \n  1.  General provisions on jurisdiction and scope.   In Section I of Part One, the \nproposed  Modified Consent Decree generally  incorporates,  with so me  modification,  the \nprovisions  of the decrees presently in force  regarding  jurisdiction, term s  for t he  Court’s \nenforcement powers, notice to the class, and other i ssues of general application.  In this Section, \nPlaintiffs agree to dismiss voluntarily the Petition after entry of an order of judicial approval and \nexpiration of the appeal period without an appeal.       \n  2.  Compliance  reporting, verification, and information -sharing.   Under the \ncurrent decrees, Defendants are req uired to file compliance reports with the Court every s ix \nmonths.  The decrees do not provide for independent verification of the Defendants’ compliance \nreports.   T he  proposed Modified Consent D ecree  would continue to require six-m onth \ncompliance reporting by Defendants, but, pursuant to Section II of Part One, all such data will be \nsubject to verification by an “Independent Verif ication Agent,” who will be resp onsible for \nensuring that (1) the data and  other information reported by Defendants are accurate, valid, and \nreliable; (2) the measures and methods used by Defendants to report data and other inform ation \nare accurate, valid, and  reliable; (3) Defendants have in place  sufficient quality control and \nreview processes to verify accurately and regularly the accuracy of data provided through their \nmanagement information systems; and (4) Defenda nts’ case review pro cess is accurate, valid, \nand reliable.   \n  Generally, Dr. Testa’s verification activities  will have two key functions: (1) to provide \naccurate, independent information to the Court and the parties about system performance to \n  5\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 6 of 21\n \nimplement the requirements of this Decree; and (2) to provide feedback  to Defendants that \nsupports self-correcting measures and ongoing quality improvement by Defendants.  Under this  \nagreement,  Defendants are required to provid e  Dr. Testa with   reasonable access to   all \ndocuments, data, and interested persons within their control and or accessible to them.   \n  Should Dr. Testa determine that the Defenda nts have not provided sufficiently reliable \nand accurate information to measure their performance on the requirem ents of the Modified \nConsent Decree, he may conduct additional information-gathering activities that he believes are \nnecessary to measure performance accurately.  These m ay include, but are not lim ited to, case \nrecord reviews, quality service reviews, interviews, surveys of children and other stakeholders, \nand review of data available to Defendants.  Pl aintiffs’ counsel have the right to all docum ents \nconsidered by the Independent Verification Agen t as well as to other docum ents through the \nprocesses  set forth in the pr oposed  Modified Consent D ecree.   Through these provisions, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel will have substantially greater access to information than they currently have \navailable under the current Consent Decrees.   Moreover, Defendants must notify Plaintiffs’ \nattorneys immediately of the death or serious  injury of any Plaintiff and must notify both \nPlaintiffs’ attorneys and the children’s Child in Need of Assistance (“CINA”) attorneys within \nfive days of any allegation of m altreatment of a Plaintiff in his or her placem ent.  The former \nrequirement is new, and the latter requirement expands the protections in the current decrees.   \n  3.  Dispute resolution.  The proposed Modified Consent Decree encourages the \nparties to communicate regularly to resolve problems and discuss barriers to compliance.  A \nForum Facilitator will chair a qua rterly meeting for this purpose.  Before any party brings a n \nissue (other than one affecting the health and s afety of the Plaintiffs) to the Court, the parties \n  6\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 7 of 21\n \nmust attempt to resolve the i ssue through a dispute re solution process.  The Forum Facilitator \nwill mediate disputes arising under the proposed Modified Consent Decree and may be asked by \neither party to issue a report with recommendations.  If the dispute is not  resolved, it may be \ntaken to the Court for resolution.  This Forum also will be used to address concerns concerning \nPlaintiffs’ access to information, the Independent Verification Agent’s decision (if it occurs) not \nto certify Defendants’ compliance data, and other related issues.   \n  4.  Enforcement, termination, and exit.   The existing decrees do not specifically \naddress the terms upon which the Court may lift the Consent Decree and allow the Defendants to \nexit its supervision.  In contrast, the Modified Consent Decree provides clear terms and standards \nfor enforcement, termination, and exit.  At  any time after Court a pproval of this proposed \nModified Consent Decree, Plain tiffs may file proceedings if they believe that imm ediate and \nirreparable harm to a group of children will re sult from Defendants’ non-compliance with the \nModified Consent Decree.  Beginning January 1, 2011, if Defendants are not in compliance with \na requirement of the decree, Plaintiffs may initiate proceedings to enforce compliance with any \nprovision of the decree.  If the Independent Veri fication Agent validates that Defendants have \nmet the Exit Standard(s) for an Outcome for three consecutive six-month reporting periods, he \nwill certify compliance with that Outcom e, after which Defendants no  longer are required to  \nreport to the Court on com pliance.  They must continue to report suc h information in their \nregular management reports on at least a quarte rly basis.  If Defenda nts’ performance on the \nOutcome over the course of a year falls a certa in amount below the Exit Standard requirement, \nPlaintiffs  can ask the Independent Verificatio n  Agent to “decertify” com pliance  with that \nOutcome,  in which case Defendants’ reporti ng  obligations to the Court would resum e.  \n  7\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 8 of 21\n \nDefendants may ask the Court to terminate the Modified Consent Decree and allow them to exit \nfrom Court supervision at such time as they are certified as compliant with every Outcome.   \nB.   Part Two (substantive provisions) of the proposed Modified Consent \nDecree.             \n \n  The  substantive requirements  of the Modifi ed  Consent Decree are divided into f ive \nsections: (1) preservation and permanency planning; (2) out-of-home placements; (3) health care; \n(4) education; and (5) workforce.  Each sect ion includes six components: (1) Statements of \nPrinciples; (2) Defendants’ Responsibilities; (3) Outcomes with Definitions; (4) Internal Success \nMeasures; (5) Exit Standards; and (6) Additional Commitments by Defendants.  The Statements \nof Principles are general explanations of the goals of the section; they are not enforceable but \nmay be used to interpret the decree’s term s and requirements.  The Responsibilities subsections \nset  forth the general responsibil ities  of Defendants in each  subject  area.  Following the \nResponsibilities, each section contains specific  Outcomes for Plaintiffs that Defendants m ust \nachieve.  These Outcomes include Definitions, which set forth defined terms for the Outcomes as \nwell  as  policies,  procedures  and  practices  to  achieve  compliance  with the   Outcomes.  \nDefendants’ performance under the Outcomes will be measured by Internal Success Measures , \nwhich track many of the specific Definitions, and by Exit Standards, which set f orth various \nstandards for certification of compliance and eventual exit from the Decree.  Finally, in addition \nto  the Outcom es,  the Modified Consent D ecree  requires Defendants to perform   various \nAdditional Commitments, which will complement and advance the other commitments specified \nfor the Outcomes. \n  8\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 9 of 21\n \n  It is impracticable to set forth and discuss here all terms and provisions of the Substantive \nRequirements.  Therefore, the parties will set  forth the Outcomes in full and briefly discuss \ncertain other provisions.   \n  1.  Preservation  and Per manency  Planning.   As  set f orth  in Sectio n  I of   the \nSubstantive Requirements, Defendants are responsible for making reasonable efforts to prevent \nor eliminate the need for placement of each child into out-o f-home placement (“OHP”), and to \nreunify each child who has been placed in OHP, by providing to families and children at risk of \nOHP, and to families whose children are in OHP, a range of sufficient services to  support the \nfamilies and avoid unnecessary placements into OHP or unnecessarily prolonged stays in OHP.  \nThis responsibility builds upon similar provisions in the current decrees, but, as set forth both in \nthe “Responsibilities” subsection and in the Outcomes and other provisions, the commitments by \nDefendants are more specific and clearly defined.   The Modified Consent Decree, for instance, \nwill require achievement of each of the following outcomes: \n  1.  Preserve Families:  Except in cas es where safety requires the em ergency \nremoval and shelter care of a child, BCDSS shall provide each family of a child at risk of \nremoval with assistance, or referral for services as appropriate, to address identified \nproblems, and BCDSS shall provide or obtain and shall m onitor such services in a \nduration and intensity reasonably calculated to enable the child to remain with the family \nwithout removal. \n2.  Minimize  Length of Stay :   BCDSS shall im plement  and achiev e  the \nchild’s permanency plan quickly.  BCDSS shall prov ide each child in OHP and each  \nfamily of a child in O HP with assistance, or referral for services as appropriate, to \naddress identified problems and needs, an d BCDSS shall provide or obtain and shal l \nmonitor such services in a duration and in tensity reasonably calculated to im plement \nexpeditiously and finalize the child’s permanency plan.  This requirement shall continue \nuntil the Juvenile Court ends BCDSS’s obligations to the child. \n  3.  Families Involved in Decision-Making:  BCDSS shall utilize a plann ing \nand decision-making model in which BCDSS m akes reasonable efforts to fully involve \nthe family of origin, the extended family members, the child (as clinically appropriate), \n  9\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 10 of 21\n \nthe child’s attorney, and other individuals able to contribute to positive outcomes for the \nchild at each critical decision-making point. \n  4.  Each Child Has a Case Plan  that Guides the Perm anency Plan:  Within \nsixty days of entering OHP, each child shall have a case plan that  shall be updated and \napproved by an internal review team at least once every six months and which shall guide \nthe permanency plan for the child.   \n  5.  BCDSS Will Provide Services Consistent with a Comprehensive Plan to \nPrepare Youth in OHP for Independence:  Each child ages fourteen and over shall receive \nservices,  including independent living serv ices,  that are reasonab ly  calculated  to \nsuccessfully transition the child to adulthood by age twenty-one.  \n \nThree of these five Outcom es (preserve families; involvement of families in decision-making, \nand  provision of services to prepare youth in  achieving  independence) are either new or  \nsignificantly updated from corresponding provisions in  the current decrees.  Each Outcom e has \nDefinitions that set forth defined terms for the Outcome as well as p olicies, procedures and \npractices to achieve compliance with the Outcome.  Furthermore, the new decree sets forth seven \nAdditional Commitments that supplement the requirements of the Outcom es as defined in the \nDefinitions, such as provisions for funding of  in-home family preservation services and for  \nneeded reunification services. \n  2.  Out-of-Home  Placement.   In S ection  II  of  the Substantive   Requirements, \nDefendants  are responsible for establishing a nd  maintaining  a conti nuum  of out-of-hom e \nplacements and caregiver supports that is reasonably calculated to ensure that each child in OHP \nis placed in a stable, least restrictive and appropriate placement.  This responsibility extends to \nconsideration of the proximity to the child’s  home prior to entering OHP and utiliza tion of \navailable extended family members (kin) or ot her available individuals known to the child.   \nWhile  the  original  Consent  Decree  also  requires  a continuum  of placements,  the Modified \nConsent Decree will require achievement of each of the following Outcomes: \n  10\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 11 of 21\n \n  1.  Each child shall be placed prom ptly in the lea st restrictive appropriate \nplacement type for that child’s needs. \n  2.  No child under the age of thirteen shall be placed  in congregate care \nunless it is medically or therapeutically necessary and the child is placed in a prog ram \nthat has services specifically designed to meet that child’s needs.   \n  3.  DHR/BCDSS  shall m aintain  a continuum   of placem ents  reasonably \ncalculated to assure that each ch ild is placed in the least restrict ive placement for that \nchild. \n  4.  Each  child in OHP and the child ’s  caregiver shall be provided those \nservices necessary and sufficient (1) to m eet the child’s immediate and long-term needs; \n(2) to support the stability of the child’s pl acement and to support the caregiver’s ability \nto meet the child’s needs; (3) to avoid placement of the child in a more restrictive setting; \nand (4) to move the child, if  appropriate given the child’s n eeds, to a less restrictive \nsetting. \n  5.  Each kinship care provider shall be  informed promptly of his or her right \nto apply to become a licensed foster paren t, and each application for licensure sh all be \ntimely processed with retroactiv e benefits provided to the  date of application.  Each \nkinship care provider will be given an applicat ion and afforded the opportunity to file an \napplication on the date the child is placed in the home.  An application will be deemed to \nhave been made when the careg iver indicates in writing his or her desire to becom e a \nlicensed  foster parent.  Each kinship ca re  provider shall be af forded  the sam e \nopportunities for training and other services as licensed foster parents. \n  6.  BCDSS shall employ a staff of specialists to provide technical assistance \nto  caseworkers  and sup ervisors  for cases th at  require sp ecialized  experience  and/or \nknowledge. \n  7.  Each child’s placement shall meet all safety, health, sanitation, licensing \nand other legal requirements for that placement.  Each placement provider shall receive \nall training required by law. \n  8.  For each child, DHR/BCDSS shall provide the caregiver with all available \ninformation about the child’s status, background, and needs.     \n  9.  Each child shall be protected from maltreatment in the child’s placement \nto the maximum extent possible. \n  10.  No child may be housed in an office, m otel, hotel, or other unlicensed \nfacility. \n  11.  Each child shall be given the opport unity to be inform ed about and, as \nclinically appropriate, to participate actively in placement decisions being made for the \nchild.   \n  12.  Each child in OHP shall be visited  by the child’s assigned caseworker or \ndesignated substitute at least once every month in the child’s placement.  \n  11\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 12 of 21\n \nAmong the specific requirem ents for these Outc omes are provisions requiring Defendants to \nsupport  child care and respite car e  for foster parents and kins hip  caregivers under certain  \ncircumstances and to conduct a biennial needs assessment of the Plaintiffs’ placement needs and \nto have an array of placements matching the assessment recommendations.  The proposed decree \nalso sets forth nine Additional Commitments that supplement the requirements of the Outcomes, \nsuch  as regular increases in foster pare nt  and Se mi-Independent  Living rates for youth \ntransitioning to independence; child care for elementary school-age children; emergency shelter \nhomes; and a kinship caregiver support center.  \n  3.  Health Care.  In Section III of th e Substantive Requirements, Defendants are \nresponsible for developing, esta blishing, and maintaining a medical care system reasonably \ncalculated to provide comprehensive health care services to children in OHP in a continual an d \ncoordinating manner in accordance with their needs.  Specifically, the Modified Consent Decree \nwill require achievement of each of the following Outcomes: \n  1.  Each child in OHP must receive an initial health screen prior to placement, \nbut, in any event, not later than five working days following placement in OHP.   \n  2.  Each  child in OHP must receive a com prehensive  health assessm ent \nwithin sixty days of entry into OHP. \n  3.  Each child in OHP must rec eive timely periodic EPSDT e xaminations, \nand  all other appropriate preventive health   assessments  and exam inations,  including \nexaminations and care targeted for adolescents and teen parents. \n  4.  Each child in OHP m ust receive timely all health services that the child \nneeds, consistent with either of the COMAR regulations addressing OHP medical care in \neffect as of December 9, 2008 (07.02.11.28(M) and (N). \n  5.  Each child in OHP must have a completed health passport and a m edical \nassistance card, which are provided promptly to each child’s caregiver.   \nOf these Outcomes, numbers 1 and 2 continue the requirements under the current decrees but set \nforth specific procedures and requirements to achieve those Outcomes.  Numbers 3 and 5 contain \n  12\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 13 of 21\n \nnew terms requiring preventive health assessments and prompt distribution of medical assistance \ncards.  Number 4 is new.  Among the Add itional Commitments are requirements that the \nDefendants continue to implement their Health Care Initiative for meeting these standards, \nincluding the development and m aintenance of a health services management unit, a m edical \ndirector, and the utilization of  medical case managers to track and oversee the health outcom es \nand to perform medical case management.  Defendants must develop and present a plan for full \nimplementation of the Health Care  Initiative for FY 2011 and m ust operationalize a system to \nmeet the mental health needs of children in OHP by December 2010.   \n  4.  Education.   In Section IV of the Substa ntive  Requirements,  Defendants  are \nresponsible for ensuring that  all children and youth in OHP are provided with appropriate \nassistance to attend and succeed in school, in cluding having the opportunity for school choice \nand to participate in school and school-related  activities.  In appropriate circumstances, BCDSS \nshould encourage the child’s caregiver to take primary responsibility for communication with the \nchild’s school and m eeting the child’s day-to-day educational needs.  Otherwise, BCDSS is \nresponsible  for (1) monitori ng  educational progress, w orking  with school personnel and \ncaregivers to ensure that educational problems are identified and addressed, and maintaining an \neducational plan for each child; (2) taking all reasonable steps to  obtain from the school system \nor third parties all necessary educational services for the child to support the child’s educational \nachievement  and to en sure  that all go als  and  tasks  in  the  child’s  educational  plan  are \naccomplished; and (3) documenting in the child’s  case file and notifying the child’s caregiver, \nparents (if appropriate), and attorney of all significant events in the child’s education, including, \nbut not limited to, report cards, aw ards or other recognition, su spension, expulsion, significant \n  13\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 14 of 21\n \ntruancy, change of  schools, school failure, and the need for special education or other services.  \nSpecifically, the Modified Consent Decree will require achievement of the following Outcomes: \n  1.  Each child in OHP shall be enrolle d in and begin attend ing the child’s \nhome school or a new school imm ediately after entry into OHP and after any change of \nplacement. \n  2.  Each child’s case plan shall include an educational plan for ensuring the \nchild’s educational stability and progress while in foster care and BCDSS shall monitor \nthe child’s educational progress.     \n  3.  Each child in OHP shall receive all necessary special education services. \nHere, the Modified Consent Decree builds upon  current provisions for school enrollm ent and \nspecial education by setting forth certain additional measures, requiring an educ ational plan \n(Outcome 2), and setting forth requirements for monitoring the child’s educational progress.   \n  5.  Workforce.   Finally, Section V of the M odified  Consent Decree addresses \nrequirements for BCDSS workforce serving Plaintiffs and their families.  Generally, Defendants \nshall  be responsible for recruiting, supporting,   and retaining a well-trained workforce and \nsupervisory system that provides for accountability  at every level.  Specifically, the Modified \nConsent Decree will require achievement of each of the following Outcomes: \n  1.  Appropriate  Caseload Ratios :   Perm anency  (foster and kinship care, \nincluding adoption) workers’ caseload of fifteen children (or any lower ratio required by \nMaryland state law); Family Resource and Support (“R&S”) workers’ caseload of forty \nfamilies (or any lower ratio required by Maryland state law); and supervisors’ caseload of \nsix caseworkers (or any lower ratio required by Maryland state law). \n  2.  Qualified Workforce with appropriate training and supervision. \n  3.  Case Transfer Policies:  Case re-assignment in five working days.  Case  \nre-assignment conference in ten working days. \nThe caseload requirements in Outcome 1 represent a significant reduction from the levels set \nforth in the current decrees (an av erage of twenty children/worker for c ontinuing foster care \nworkers and thirty children/worker for kinship care cases).  Moreover, the caseload requirements \n  14\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 15 of 21\n \nwill apply to caseworkers indiv idually and not as an aggregate averag e.  The second and third  \nOutcomes carry forward the requirements of the current decrees.   \nIII.   The Proposed Modified Consent D ecree Fully Protects the Interes ts of the \nClass.                      \n  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(e), this Court must approve any proposed settlement in a \nclass action.  Rule 23(e) sets forth the following requirements: \nThe claims, issues, or defenses of a cert ified class may be settled, voluntarily \ndismissed,  or com promised  only with th e  court’s approval.  The following \nprocedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise: \n  (1)    The Court must direct noti ce in a reasonab le manner to all class  \nmembers who would be bound by the proposal. \n  (2)  If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it \nonly after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n  (3)  The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any \nagreement made in connection with the proposal. \n  (4)  If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the \ncourt may refuse to approve a settlem ent unless it affords a new opportunity to \nrequest exclusion to individual class m embers who had an earlier opportunity to \nrequest exclusion but did not do so. \n  (5)  Any  class m ember  may  object  to  the propo sal  if  it re quires \napproval under this subdivision (2); the objection may be withdrawn only with the \ncourt’s approval. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  The Fourth  Circuit has not yet considered  these specific terms of Rule \n23(e), which were promulgated in 2003.  Nevert heless, prior decisions mandated these and \nadditional elements.  In Scardeletti v. DeBarr, Case Nos. 99-2619, et al., 43 Fed. Appx. 525 (4th \nCir. Aug. 8, 2002), the Fourth Circuit set forth its standard for approval of a settlement of a class \naction dispute, requiring the Court to conduct a “j udicial inquiry into the fairness and adequacy \nof the proposed settlement,” Scardeletti, 43 Fed. Appx. at 538 (citing Kovacs v. Ernst & Young , \n927 F.2d 155, 158 (4th Cir.1991)), applying the following factors:  \n  15\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 16 of 21\n \nIn determining whether a settlement is fair, the district court should examine “(1) \nthe posture of the case at  the time settlement was proposed, (2) the extent of \ndiscovery  that has been conducted, (3 )  the circum stances  surrounding the \nnegotiations, and (4) the experience of counsel” in the relevant area of class action \nlitigation.  [Kovacs, 927 F.2d] at 159.  In determ ining whether a settlem ent is \nadequate,  a district court should consid er  “(1) the relative strength of the \nplaintiffs' case on th e merits, (2) the exis tence of any difficulties of proof or \nstrong defenses the plaintiffs are likely to enco unter if the case goes to trial, (3) \nthe anticipated duration and expense of a dditional litigation, (4) the solvency of \nthe defendants and the likelihood of recovery on a litigated judgment, and (5) the \ndegree of opposition to the settlement.”  Id. \n \nScardeletti, 43 Fed. Appx. at 538.  The 2003 am endments to Rule 23(e) have confirm ed the \nrequirements of approval by the C ourt after notice, hearing and a fi nding that the settlement is \n“fair, reasonable, and adequate.” \n  The parties believe that the proposed Modified Consent Decree protects the interests of \nthe class and is fair, reas onable, and adequate.  See  Attachment C, Declaration of Plaintiffs’ \nattorney  Mitchell  Y. Mirviss 1  (“Mirviss  Decl.”),  Attachment  D,  Declaration  of Plaintif fs’ \nattorney Rhonda B. Lipkin (“Lipkin Decl.”), Attachment E, Declaration of Defendants’ attorney \nDavid E. Beller (“Beller Decl.”).   \n  IV.  This Court Should Approve the Proposed Modified Consent Decree. \n  Review of a proposed class action settlem ent generally involves two stages.  First, the \nCourt makes a preliminary fairness evaluation on the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of \nthe proposed settlement terms and, upon a prelim inary finding of fairness, reasonableness, and \nadequacy, directs the preparation of notice of th e certification, proposed settlement, and date of \nthe final fairness hearing.  See Federal Judicial Center, Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) \n                                                 \n1 Defendants do not adopt Plaintiffs’ interpretation and characterization of the proposed Modified Consent Decree as \nset forth in the declarations of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Moreover, Defendants specifically do not agree  with the \ncharacterizations of this litigation, the current decree, and the proposed Modified Consent Decree contained in the \nMirviss Declaration.   \n  16\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 17 of 21\n \n§§ 21.632-21.633 (2004); DeJulius v. New England H ealth Care Employees Pension Fund, 429 \nF.3d 935, 939 (10th Cir. 2005).  The purpose of the preliminary approval process is to determine \nwhether any reason exists not to notify the class members of the proposed settlem ent and to \nproceed with a fairness hearing.  See , e.g., Gautreaux v. Pierce, 690 F.2d 616, 621 n.3 (7th Cir . \n1982); 4 Robert Newberg,  Newberg on Class Actions, § 11:25 at 38 (4th ed. 2002).  After the \nfairness hearing and consideration of any objecti ons, the Court “must ensure that there is a  \nsufficient record as to the basi s and justification for the settlement. … The record and Court’s \nfindings must demonstrate to a reviewing court that the judge has made the requisite inquiry and \nhas considered the diverse interests and the r equisite factors in determining the settlement’s \nfairness, reasonableness, and adequacy.”  Manual f or Complex Litigation, supra, at § 21.635.   \nThese tests are amply satisfied here. \nA.  The Proposed Modified Consent Decree Meets the Req uirements for \nPreliminary Approval.           \n \n  As fully set forth in the attached declar ations, the proposed Modified Consent Decree \nmeets all requirements for preliminary approval.  See Exs. C-D, Mirviss and Lipkin Decls. at ¶¶ \n5; Ex. E, Beller Decl. at ¶ 5. The proposed Modified Consent Decree was the result of extensive, \nnon-collusive, arms-length negotiations by experienced counsel.  See Mirviss and Lipkin Decls. \nat ¶¶ 5; Beller Decl. at ¶ 6.   Since October 2008, the parties have  held numerous meetings to \nnegotiate the proposed Modified Consent Decree and exchanged many drafts.  See Mirviss and \nLipkin Decls. at ¶¶ 5, 8; Beller  Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 6.Both sides  have zealously represented the \npositions of their clients.  Id.  In addition, the parties agree that the benefit to the class outweighs \nthe possibility of future relief after litigation.  See Mirviss Decl. at 5, 11-17 and Lipkin Decl. at \n¶¶ 4, 5; Beller Decl. at ¶ 7.  The proposed Modifi ed Consent Decree protects the interests of the \n  17\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 18 of 21\n \nPlaintiff class and is fair, r easonable, and adequate.  See  Mirviss Decl. at 5, 11-17 and Lipkin \nDecl. at ¶¶ 4, 5; Beller Decl. at ¶  5.   It does not provide preferential treatment to any particular \nmembers or segments of the class, nor does it provide for monetary relief to any members of the \nclass.  See Mirviss and Lipkin Decls. at ¶¶ 5; Beller Decl. at ¶ 5.  Finally, the parties have agreed \nto defer any consideration of attorney’s fees until the conclusion of the judicial approval process.   \nIn short, the proposed Modified Consent Decree meets all requirements of Rule 23(e). \nB.   The Parties’ Proposed Notice Will Fair ly Apprise the Class of the \nParties’ Proposed Settlement.          \n \n  Rule 23(e) requires that notice be given  “in a reasonable manner to all class m embers \nwho would be bound by the proposal.”  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 23(e).  The content and f orm of that \nnotice are left to the Court’s discretion.  Under Ru le 23, the standard for the settlement notice is \nthat it must “fairly apprise” the class m embers of the terms of the proposed settlem ent and of \ntheir options.  3B Moore’s Federal Practice  ¶ 23.80[3], at  23-484 (citing Gottlieb v. W iles, \n11 F.3d 1004, 1012 (10th Cir. 1993)).  \n  The parties’ proposed form of notice is atta ched as Attachment F.  This proposed notice \nfairly apprises class members of this important juncture in the lawsuit and satisf ies the due \nprocess concerns of Rule 23(e).   It provides the class with info rmation on the date and tim e of \nthe fairness hearing; a description of the class and this action; a summary of the key terms of the \nparties’ agreement; and the procedure for filing any appearances or objections to the agreement.  \n(See Attachment G, proposed “Objection to Proposed Modified Consent Decree” form.)  It also \ninforms the class that, if  the Court approves  the proposed Modified Consent Decree, and upon \nthe expiration of any appeal period, Plaintiffs will voluntarily dismiss their pending petition for \n  18\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 19 of 21\n \ncontempt,  enforcement  and m odification.   The pa rties  propose  that  this  form  of notice be \ncommunicated to the class in the following manner:  \n(1)   The  notice, the proposed Modified  Consent  Decree,  the Motion,   and this  \nMemorandum and its attachments will be posted on the DHR, BCDSS, and Public \nJustice Center websites.  \n (2)  Defendants will either mail or hand deliver the notice and a copy of the Motion,  \nthis Memorandum and its attachments, including the proposed Modified Consent \nDecree, to DHR’s contract providers that represent Plaintiffs in CINA cases in the \nCircuit Court for Baltimore City, Division of Juvenile Causes. \n(3)  The  notice (with directions on how   to find a copy of the Motion, this \nMemorandum and its attachm ents, and the proposed Modified Consent Decree) \nwill be distributed by Defendants to the Judges and Masters of the Circuit Court \nfor  Baltimore  City, Division of   Juvenile  Causes,  the B altimore  City Court \nAppointed Special Advocate (“CASA”) program, the Citizens’ Review Boards for \nBaltimore City and for the State, the Baltim ore City foster parent association, the \nOffice  of the Public Defender, the Ma ryland  Association of Resources for \nFamilies and Youth, the Maryland Disability  Law Center, the Superintendent of  \nthe  Baltimore  City Pub lic  Schools,  the  Commissioner  of  the Baltim ore  City \nHealth Department, the Coalition to Protect Maryland’s Children, Advocates for \nChildren  and Youth, the Foster Care  Alumni  Association of Maryland, the \nMaryland Foster Youth Resource Center , the members of the BCDSS Health  \nAdvisory Group, and Univers ity of Baltimore and University of Maryland Law \nSchool Professors Barbara Babb and Susan Leviton.   \n(4)  Defendants will notify individually all Baltimore City foster parents, unlicensed \nkinship care providers, licensed foster care  providers, and parents of Plaintiffs as \nfollows: Defendants will mail to each a postcard, attached as Attachment H, that \ncontains a statement that the parties have moved to modify the existing decrees \nand that provides the web site addre sses where the proposed Modified Consent \nDecree, the Motion, and this Mem orandum and their attachments are posted.  In \naddition, the postcard will have a toll free  telephone number that recipients may \ncall to request more information, a copy of these item s, or a form for filing an  \nobjection. \n  The parties’ proposed process for giving cl ass members notice of the Agreem ent meets \nthe requirements of Rule 23 and sa tisfies procedural due process  concerns.  First, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel have certified that they  are authorized to agree to th is proposed Modified Consent \nDecree on behalf of the Plaintiff cl ass.  Second, the parties agree to provide notice to Plaintiffs \n  19\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556   Filed 06/22/09   Page 20 of 21\n \nvia their authorized representatives, i.e., their attorneys in their CINA cases in the Circuit Court \nfor Baltimore City, Division of Juvenile Causes.  In addition, this process is calculated to reach \nother interested parties who play a key role in  advocating for class m embers, such as foster \nparents and kinship caregivers, CASAs,  members of the Citizens’ Revie w Board for Children \nand other community advocates for children. \nV.   Conclusion. \n  The  parties’ proposed Modified Consen t  Decree and proposed notice satisfy all \nrequirements of Rule 23.  Accordingly, the parties  respectfully request that this Court enter the \nproposed orders preliminarily approving the terms of the Modified Consent Decree and allowing \nDefendants to move forward with providing notice of the proposed settlem ent and fairness \nhearing to class members and other interested parties in the manner set forth herein.  Finally, the \nparties further request that, after the fairness hearing and any further briefing required, this Court \nenter the proposed order granting final approval of the proposed Modified Consent Decree.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n              /s/                                                         /s/          \nRhonda B.

Gen. (J. Joseph Curran, Jr., Atty. Gen., \nRalph S. Tyler, Asst. Atty. Gen., on brief), for defendants-appellants. \nWilliam Lee Grimm (Ethel Zelenske, Legal Aid Bureau, Inc., on brief), Ward Baldwin Coe, III \n(Nevett Steele, Jr., Whiteford, Taylor & Preston, Carol R. Golubock, Children's Defense \nFund, on brief), for plaintiffs-appellees. \nBefore WINTER, Chief Judge, RUSSELL and MURNAGHAN, Circuit Judges. \nHARRISON L. WINTER, Chief Judge: \nPlaintiffs, present or former foster children in the custody of the Baltimore City Department \nof Social Services, sued twenty-one state and city officials, caseworkers and supervisors \nwho played a role in administering Maryland's federally-funded foster care program in \nBaltimore City. They alleged that, as a result of defendants' maladministration of the \nprogram, they were victims of physical and sexual abuse as well as medical neglect. They \nsought broad interim and permanent injunctive relief to redress the deficiencies in the \nadministration of the program and money damages. \n120*120 Defendants traversed the claims for injunctive and monetary relief and also \nspecially pled their good faith immunity to damages for plaintiffs' claims prior to 1980 and \nour holding in Jensen v. Conrad, 747 F.2d 185 (4 Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1052, \n105 S.Ct. 1754, 84 L.Ed.2d 818 (1985). \nThe district court heard and decided defendants' claim for qualified immunity and plaintiffs' \nclaim for interim injunctive relief. It granted a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to \nsubmit a plan for review of foster homes about which a report of maltreatment has been \nmade, to monitor child placements in foster homes at least monthly and in some instances \nweekly, to expand its medical services to foster children including the keeping of medical \nrecords, and to provide prompt written reports of maltreatment of foster children to their \nattorneys and the juvenile court including the action taken thereon. It denied defendants' \nclaim of immunity, and it imposed attorneys' fees and expenses as sanctions on \ndefendants, in an amount yet to be determined, for their failure to comply with two court \norders. \n\nDefendants appeal, and we affirm. \nI. \nAs a preliminary matter, we state our jurisdiction to entertain all aspects of this appeal. We, \nof course, have jurisdiction to review the grant of a preliminary injunction by the express \nlanguage of 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). We also have jurisdiction to review the district court's \ndenial of defendants' claim of qualified immunity under the holding in Mitchell v. Forsyth, \n472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). We proceed therefore to review the \ncorrectness of both rulings. \nII. \nIn concluding to grant a preliminary injunction, the district court correctly considered each of \nthe factors set forth in the leading case in this circuit, Blackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig \nMfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189 (4 Cir.1977). There we held that four factors are to be considered: \n(1) the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the preliminary injunction is denied, (2) \nthe likelihood of harm to the defendant if the requested relief is granted, (3) the likelihood \nthat the plaintiff will succeed on the merits, and (4) the public interest. See Federal Leasing, \nInc. v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, 650 F.2d 495, 499 (4 Cir.1981). As Blackwelder set forth, the \ntwo most important factors are the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if interim \nrelief is not granted and the likelihood of irreparable harm to the defendant if interim relief is \ngranted. The two factors should be weighed against one another, and if the balance is in \nfavor of the plaintiff, it is proper to grant interim injunctive relief if grave or serious questions \nare presented for ultimate decision. Blackwelder, 550 F.2d at 196. See also Jones v. Bd. of \nGovernors of Univ. of North Carolina, 704 F.2d 713, 715 (4 Cir.1983); Fort Sumter Tours, \nInc. v. Andrus, 564 F.2d 1119, 1124-25 (4 Cir.1977). \nThe district court found that there was the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs if \ninterim relief were not granted on a dual basis. It found this likelihood as a matter of fact \nafter conducting an evidentiary hearing at which it heard testimony and received other \nevidence, and it found this likelihood as a matter of law as a sanction for certain defaults \nand omissions on the part of defendants' lawyers. Because we think that the factual finding \nof the likelihood of irreparable harm to plaintiffs is not clearly erroneous, we conclude that it \nis unnecessary for us to consider the appropriateness of the sanction that it be considered \nas established \"that defendants fail to protect effectively children in foster homes where \nthere is reason to know that such children are at risk of harm to their physical and emotional \nwell-being.\"[1] We express no view of the appropriateness of the additional sanction of \nattorney's fees and expenses in an amount yet to be determined. While the record reflects \nsome defaults on the part of defendants' counsel, we do not 121*121 think that this aspect \nof the case is properly before us until the amount and form of the sanction are fixed. \nAs a factual matter, plaintiffs presented a statistical study of the case records maintained by \nthe officials on children in foster care prepared by an expert in research methodology and \nchild welfare services. The study documented systemic problems in the Baltimore foster \ncare program with grave consequences to children in the program and great likelihood of \nirreparable harm. In addition there was testimony by relatives and expert witnesses \n\nregarding the cases of sixteen children who had recently been severely abused or \nneglected, or both, while in foster care. Finally there was testimony from several experts on \nfoster care to the effect that there were systemic deficiencies in the foster care program \nwhich placed the children at substantial risk of severe harm, including the testimony of two \nphysicians experienced in the medical care provided to children in foster care, who \nconcluded that defendants were failing to take responsible measures to ensure foster \nchildren essential and basic medical care, placing them at risk of severe diseases and other \nillnesses. \nDefendants sought to counter this proof by attacking the methodology of the statistical \nsample and evidence of the so-called Report of the Harris Task Force, an internal study, \nwhich detailed deficiencies in the foster care program and made recommendations for their \nalleviation, together with proof of the corrective actions they had taken. As to the latter, the \ndistrict court made full and persuasive findings as to why defendants' responses to the \nproblems identified by the Harris Task Force were ineffective and incomplete. We cannot \nsay that these findings lack full evidentiary support. Nor do we think that plaintiffs' statistical \nstudy was flawed or that its findings must be disregarded. In our view the statistical sample \nwas significant. It was based on a random selection of 897 of the roughly 4,000 children in \nthe foster program, which was further refined by the use of sampling criteria to a pool of 224 \nchildren. The district court found 15 well-founded cases of abuse or neglect in the sample \nand further indicated that the pool may contain up to 24 additional such cases. We see no \nabuse of discretion on the part of the district court in affording the study substantial \nprobative value. \nDefendants' proof of irreparable injury to it should interim relief be granted was evidence of \nthe obvious — the monetary cost and administrative inconvenience to the city and state of a \nmore encompassing administration of the foster child care program. In addition they argued \nto the district court and contend before us that principles of federalism protect them against \nfederal judicial interference in the administration of a state program, absent convincing proof \nof deliberate indifference on their part to the plight of the victims of maladministration, if any. \nWe recognize that the considerations pressed on us by defendants are weighty. We note of \ncourse that if carried to their logical extreme, federal courts would be powerless to enforce \nfederal rights in any case where enforcement would conflict with the rights of a state. Such \nis not the law and we think that, properly applied, the Blackwelder test recognizes that the \ninterests of the state are to be fully respected and overridden only in those instances in \nwhich the apparent denial of a federal right is so egregious that the individual right to interim \nrelief outweighs the governmental interest to be free from federal judicial interference. The \nelement of deliberate indifference may be a substantial factor in the aspect of this case \nwhich seeks monetary recovery, but it is of little moment with regard to injunctive relief in \nfuturo if plaintiffs can prove that defendants are not acting lawfully. In this case we cannot \nsay that if, as will be later shown, plaintiffs have made a showing of probable success in \ntheir claim for permanent relief, the district court improperly balanced the respective rights \nof plaintiffs and defendants with regard to prospective injunctive relief. Defendants' real \nharm is the expenditure of money. Admittedly the supply of money is finite, but balanced \nagainst that is the emotional, psychological and physical damage to children, much of which \nwill continue throughout their lives. In short, we see no basis on which to fault the district \ncourt 122*122 on how it balanced the equities and why it concluded that irreparable \n\ndamage to plaintiffs if relief were not granted outweighed the injury to defendants if relief \nwas granted. \nFinally, consistent with Blackwelder, we have no doubt that plaintiffs' case presents a grave \nand substantial question. Defendants do not seriously contend with respect to prospective \nrelief that if plaintiffs prove their allegations, which they have already demonstrated have an \narguably solid foundation, plaintiffs will have proven a violation of their due process rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Fox v. Custis, 712 F.2d 84, 88 (4 Cir.1983) (rights \nmay arise out of special custodial or other relationships created or assumed by the State in \nrespect of particular persons). For the reasons that we will shortly discuss with respect to \ndefendants' claim of qualified immunity, we think that plaintiffs will have also proven a \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 608(f) (1961) and its subsequent amendments. Thus we affirm the \ndistrict court's judgment granting a preliminary injunction. \nIII. \nIn the district court defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that they \nwere immune to damage claims for action or non-action attributable to them prior to 1980. \nLater in argument before the district court and before us, they assert immunity even after \n1980. Invoking the principle that immunity in the performance of discretionary duties exists \nwhere the law governing official conduct is unsettled, their claim for pre-1980 immunity was \ngrounded on the argument that not until the decision in Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, \n285, 100 S.Ct. 553, 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980), was there recognized a constitutional right \nto protection on the part of persons in the custody of the state, except in the prison context, \nand that we recognized this uncertain state of the law in Jensen v. Conrad, 747 F.2d 185 (4 \nCir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1052, 105 S.Ct. 1754, 84 L.Ed.2d 818 (1985). Their claim \nfor post-1980 immunity is grounded on the argument that even now the law is uncertain as \nto whether they could reasonably be expected to know that placing children in their custody \nin an unsuitable foster home could constitute a violation of the constitutional rights of those \nchildren.[2] \nThe district court placed its denial of the immunity defense on the dual grounds that (a) \nduring the period in litigation, there existed a constitutional right to protection on the part of \nthose in the custody of the state or having a special relationship with the state, even out of \nthe prison context, so that defendants could have reasonably expected to know that a \nfailure on their part to protect foster children placed by them in foster homes selected by \nthem could constitute a violation of plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights, and (b) since \n1961 plaintiffs had a statutory right, enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to the care and \nprotection that they allege were denied, so that defendants could not be said to exercise \ndiscretion in an area in which the law respecting their duties and obligations was uncertain. \nWe agree with the district court that defendants' statutory duty was clear and certain and \ntherefore they are not entitled to invoke the immunity defense. Our conclusion makes it \nunnecessary to decide whether plaintiffs' constitutional rights were also violated prior to \n1980 if they can prove what they have alleged. \nThe foster care program in Baltimore City is federally funded. In 1961 the funding statute \ncreated both the obligations of those administering the program and the rights of \nbeneficiaries thereunder. That statute was part of the Aid to Families with Dependent \n\nChildren program in Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 608 (repealed by the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-272). The original statute \nrequired states participating in the foster care program to develop \"a plan for each such \nchild [in foster care] (including periodic review of the necessity for the child's being in a \nfoster family home or child-care institution) to assure that he receives proper care....\" 42 \nU.S.C. § 608(f) (repealed in 1980). In 123*123 1980 and thereafter, the foster care program \nwas made a separate title of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 671, 675. Significantly, \nhowever, the duty to assure that a child in foster care receives \"proper care\" was continued \nand amplified. Titles IV-E and IV-B of the Social Security Act as it now exists contains the \nfollowing relevant requirements. A State participating in the program is required to have a \nplan which provides for an agency \"responsible for establishing and maintaining standards \nfor foster family homes and child care institutions which are reasonably in accord with \nrecommended standards of national organizations concerned with standards for such \ninstitutions or homes, including standards related to admission policies, safety, sanitation, \nand protection of civil rights....\" 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10). \nIn addition the eligibility of a State to receive an appropriation is conditioned upon its \nimplementation and operation of \"a case review system ... for each child receiving foster \ncare under the supervision of the State....\" 42 U.S.C. § 627(a)(2)(B). This requirement is \nrepeated and amplified in 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16), which requires a State's plan to provide \nfor \"a case plan ... for each child receiving foster care maintenance payments ... [and] a \ncase review system ... with respect to each such child.\"[3] Finally, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(9) \nrequires a State's plan to provide that \"where any agency of the State has reason to believe \nthat the home or institution in which a child resides ... is unsuitable for the child because of \nthe neglect, abuse, or exploitation of such child, it shall bring such condition to the attention \nof the appropriate court or law enforcement agency.\" \nTaken together we think that these statutory provisions spell out a standard of conduct, and \nas a corollary rights in plaintiffs, which plaintiffs have alleged have been denied. It is true \nthat the statutes are largely statutes relating to appropriations, but, defendants' argument to \nthe contrary notwithstanding, they are privately enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See \nMiller v. Youakim, 440 U.S. 125, 99 S.Ct. 957, 59 L.Ed.2d 194 (1979); Rosado v. Wyman, \n397 U.S. 397, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. \n2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968). Moreover the Supreme Court did not distinguish between \nprospective equitable relief and an action for money damages in regard to the right to \nenforce privately in Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Hous. Auth., ___ U.S. ___, 107 \nS.Ct. 766, 770 n. 5, 773, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987). \nWe therefore conclude that the district court correctly denied defendants' motion 124*124 \nfor summary judgment on the ground of immunity and we affirm its ruling. We should not be \nunderstood, however, to mean that defendants or any of them are necessarily liable for \nmoney damages. Their right to claim immunity must be determined by an objective test \nrather than their subjective good faith belief, see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, \n102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), and we decide only that objectively, to the \nextent that they had discretion in the exercise of their duties, they would not be justified in \ndoing or in failing to do what is alleged, if that be proven.[4] The proof, however, of the \nalleged actionable nonfeasance and malfeasance must await further proceedings in the \ndistrict court. \n\nAFFIRMED. \n[1] Order of the district court entered July 27, 1987. J.A. 506. \n[2] Defendants' argument deals only with the constitutional rights of foster children, because defendants argue that \nthe foster children have no statutory rights which are enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We touch on this argument \nin the text infra. \n[3] \"Case plan\" and \"case review system\" are both elaborately defined in 42 U.S.C. § 675, the relevant text of which \nfollows:  \nThe term \"case plan\" means a written document which includes at least the following: A description of the type of \nhome or institution in which a child is to be placed, including a discussion of the appropriateness of the placement \nand how the agency which is responsible for the child plans to carry out the voluntary placement agreement entered \ninto or judicial determination made with respect to the child in accordance with section 672(a)(1) of this title; and a \nplan for assuring that the child receives proper care and that services are provided to the parents, child, and foster \nparents in order to improve the conditions in the parents' home, facilitate return of the child to his own home or the \npermanent placement of the child, and address the needs of the child while in foster care, including a discussion of \nthe appropriateness of the services that have been provided to the child under the plan. Where appropriate, for a \nchild age 16 or over, the case plan must also include a written description of the programs and services which will \nhelp such child prepare for the transition from foster care to independent living. \n. . . . . \nThe term \"case review system\" means a procedure for assuring that — \n(A) each child has a case plan designed to achieve placement in the least restrictive (most family like) setting \navailable and in close proximity to the parents' home, consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child, \n(B) the status of each child is reviewed periodically but no less frequently than once every six months by either a \ncourt or by administrative review (as defined in paragraph (6)) in order to determine the continuing necessity for and \nappropriateness of the placement, the extent of compliance with the case plan, and the extent of progress which has \nbeen made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care, and to project a likely \ndate by which the child may be returned to the home or placed for adoption or legal guardianship.... \n[4] In view of this conclusion we do not consider what discretion, if any, is vested in any particular defendant in the \nperformance of his duties under the program. \n ",

Since the MCD has been entered, Plaintiffs have done so. Nevertheless,\nin light of the recent change with regard to the Independent Verification Agent (“IVA”) under\nthe MCD and the fact 2½ years have transpired since the decree was signed, Plaintiffs submit\nthis short Response addressing problems pertaining to reports of the prior IVA and the status of\ncomplianceonkeyrequirements.\n1. IVA Report. The prior Independent Verification Agent’s reports certification\nreports assessing the validity, accuracy, and reliability of Defendants’ 44th and 45th Six-Month\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 621   Filed 01/23/12   Page 2 of 5\nCompliance Reports have numerous problems that make it difficult to assess information\npresentedinDefendants’ reports.\nFirst, the IVA does not adequatelyaddress deficiencies in the criteria that Defendants use\nto measure compliance. In manyinstances, performance data in Defendants’ reports do not fully\nmeasure compliance and instead apply criteria or measurements that are more narrowly defined\nthan the MCD’s requirements. Plaintiffs’ critique of the criteria (which was provided to\nDefendants and the IVA earlier last year) is attached. (Att. A, Pls. Rep. to Defs. Regarding\nDefs.’ Compl. Measures and Criteria). As these demonstrate, the compliance data do not match\nup with the MCD requirements. The IVA’s response to the 44th report did not address these\nproblems. Thus, where the IVA provisionally certified certain health measures (e.g., completed\nhealth passports being promptly given to caregivers), he did not consider problems with\nDefendants’ measures and criteria for compliance. For instance, BCDSS determines compliance\nwith the health passport requirement by determining whether a passport was given when the\nchild was placed with the caregiver, which occurs before medical information about the child is\ngathered; the passport therefore may be blank, but that would be deemed compliant so long as it\nis physicallyhandedtothecaregiver.\nSecond, the IVA’s report did not conduct the level of verification needed to determine\nwhether actual compliance occurred. For instance, to validate compliance data for the health\npassport requirement, the IVA merely looked at Defendants’ computer database (“MD.\nCHESSIE”) for vaccination records to certify “provisional” compliance. The IVA did not\ndetermine what information was provided to the caregivers, and when – the actual test for\ncompliance – even though the MCD requires passports to contain much more information that\n-2-\nBA2DOCS1-#430949-v4-Plaintiffs__Response_to_Defendants__44th_and_45th_Six-Month_Compliance_Reports\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 621   Filed 01/23/12   Page 3 of 5\nvaccination records. Indeed, in the 45th Report, the IVA determined that key health information\nwas not in MD. CHESSIE for manycases and thus revised his“provisional” certification to a “no\ncertification”finding.\nThird, the IVA’s use of “provisional” certification is not permitted under the MCD.\nWhile it is understandable that the IVA may not be able to address certain items at any given\ntime, such that the IVA may need to defer the issue for a later report, the use of “provisional”\ncertificationdenotes aprematuredeterminationbeforethefacts are gatheredandis improper.\nFourth, the IVA did not consider the Additional Commitments of the MCD. The IVA is\nresponsible for determining the accuracy, validity, and reliability of Defendants’ reported\ncompliance with all of the Substantive Requirements of the MCD, which includes the Additional\nCommitments. His failure to certify compliance with these constitutes a de facto finding of non-\ncompliance.\nFifth, many of these problems result from an inadequate budget. The fact that the\nconsequences of this slow pace (a lack of progress in certification) falls on Defendants is\nunfortunatebut unavoidablegiventhe IVA’s budget limitations.\nPlaintiffs addressed these and other concerns in a report responding to the IVA’s draft\ncertification report for Defendants’ 44th Six-Month Compliance Report. See Att. B, Pls. Resp.\nto Rep. of the IVA re: L.J. Defs. 44th Compl. Rep. (submitted March 14, 2011), which is\nincorporated by reference. The IVA addressed some of these concerns in his certification\nanalysis forthe45thReport.\n2. Additional Commitments. Defendants have yet to comply with many of the\nAdditional Commitments.

Low compliance numbers. In both the 44th and 45th Reports, Defendants report\nlow compliance levels for key Outcome areas of the MCD. For example, Defendants report that\nin 3.5% (44th Rep.) and 1.8% (45th Rep.) of their reunification cases, BCDSS facilitated parent\nvisits once per week. Other areas reporting low compliance include reunification cases with\nservice agreements with parents; reunification cases with referrals made for services identified in\nthe service agreement; cases in which BCDSS searched for relatives; youth with transition plans\nto help them reach independence; placements meeting legal requirements for licensing, health\nand safety; providing caregivers with information about the children placed in their care; prompt\ninvestigation of suspected maltreatment of foster children; timely case plans; involvement of\nyouth in placement decisions; monthly visits of children in their placements; timely\ncomprehensive health assessments; providing necessary health care to children; preschool\nenrollment; monitoring of educational progress; efforts to obtain special education services;\ntraining of caseworkers; and timely transfer of cases. While the low compliance numbers may\nreflect inpart someoftheabovedataproblems, theyalso indicatethat manyproblems remain.\nPlaintiffs disagree with some of Defendants’ explanations. For example, Defendants\nclaim that some of the low numbers reflect “modern” expectations or involve “measures that are\nnew to the Agency,” see Defs. 44th Rep. at 26, yet those requirements (e.g., mental health\nassessments and“quality”homevisits withchildren)existedintheoldConsent Decree.\nCONCLUSION\nIn raising these concerns, Plaintiffs acknowledge and praise the dedication and tireless\nefforts of the BCDSS Director to address the needs of the children and families in her care. Still.\nDefendants have a long wayto go before the MCD’s promise will be met for Baltimore children\n-4-\nBA2DOCS1-#430949-v4-Plaintiffs__Response_to_Defendants__44th_and_45th_Six-Month_Compliance_Reports\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 621   Filed 01/23/12   Page 5 of 5\nand families.

These changes shall be \nin effect only for so long as Rhonda Lipkin serves as the Independent Verification Agent \nas that term is defined in the MCD.  Upon such time that Rhonda Lipkin no longer serves \nas the Independent Verification Agent, all of these modified terms shall extinguish and no \nlonger be of any force and effect, and all original terms of the MCD shall take full force \nand effect immediately.  \n1. Part II, Section A of the MCD is modified such that the last sentence of \nSection A is deleted and replaced with “The Independent Verification Agent is Rhonda \nLipkin, effective September 1, 2011.”   The parties agree that they will not contest the \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 614   Filed 08/19/11   Page 2 of 5\nappointment of Rhonda Lipkin as IVA for 18 months.  At the end of that 18-month \nperiod, if the parties agree, Rhonda Lipkin will be reappointed as IVA.  If after conferring \nwith the other party concerning reappointment, mutual agreement is not achieved, the \nparties will not seek judicial review of this decision.\n2. Part II, Section K of the MCD is modified to add at the end of the first \nsentence, “or to address concerns that any party may have regarding the Independent \nVerification Agent's certification report or statement discussed in Part II, Section J.”  \n3. Part IV of the MCD is modified to replace the introductory paragraph and \nSections A through D as follows:\nIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\nIn the event that Plaintiffs identify an area in which they assert Defendants are not \nin compliance with the Decree, or in the event that either party disagrees with a \ndecision by the IVA regarding certification:\nA. The  dissatisfied  party  shall,  prior  to  seeking  judicial  relief, notify  the \nopposing party and the Forum Facilitator in writing of the issue.  \nB. Within twenty calendar days of this notification, the opposing party shall \nrespond in writing to the dissatisfied party and the Forum Facilitator as to (1) \nwhether it disagrees with any of the facts and issues raised in the written notice; \n(2) the basis for each such instance of disagreement; and (3) what actions, if any, it \nproposes to take with regard to the issue of alleged non-compliance.  \n2\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 614   Filed 08/19/11   Page 3 of 5\nC. Regardless  of  whether  the  opposing  party  agrees  with  the dissatisfied \nparty's assertions, the parties shall meet with the Forum Facilitator within fifteen \ncalendar days of the opposing party's response, unless otherwise agreed to by the \nparties.  The purpose of this meeting shall be for the parties to engage in good \nfaith negotiations  with  the  assistance  of  the  Forum  Facilitator  to  determine\nwhether additional actions are necessary to address the assertions raised by the \ndissatisfied party in the notification.  The parties shall engage in negotiations for a \nperiod not to exceed twenty calendar days, unless extended by mutual agreement \nof the parties.  \nD. At the conclusion of the dispute resolution process, if the parties have failed \nto come to an agreement, either party may request the Forum Facilitator to analyze \nthe  issues  raised  by  the  parties,  and prepare  and  issue  a  report  with \nrecommendations concerning the dispute.  The report shall be issued no later than \nten days  after the dispute resolution process  has  ended.  This report shall be \nprovided to the parties and, at the request of either party, to the Court.  \n4. For so long as Rhonda Lipkin serves as the Independent Verification Agent, \nwhere Plaintiffs have a dispute with Defendants concerning issues or events preceding \nthe effective date of this Order, Ms. Lipkin shall not testify in a Court proceeding on \nbehalf of Plaintiffs as to such matters but may submit a statement via affidavit concerning \n3\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 614   Filed 08/19/11   Page 4 of 5\nher knowledge or opinions of events up to the effective date of this Order if requested to \ndo so by Plaintiffs.\n5. By approving these modifications to the MCD, the Court acknowledges and \nwaives on behalf of the Plaintiff class any actual or potential conflict of interest or other \nethical concern arising from Ms. Lipkin (including any of her agents or staff) serving as \nthe Independent Verification Agent after having served as co-counsel or agents for the \nPlaintiff class.

The appeal  is based on  allegations \nthat changes in the law brought about by Supreme Court deci \nsions  have  eliminated  the  legal  bases  for  the  decrees.  We \naffinn the well-reasoned decision of the district court. \nI. \nThe parties to this appeal have a lengthy history together, \nan understanding of which is essential to a consideration of \nthe issues presented.

WILBON  3 \ndren in the care and custody of the Baltimore City Department \nof Social Services (\"BCDSS\"), brought a civil  rights action \npursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1983 against BCDSS and numerous \ncity  and  state  foster  care  officials  and  personnel \n(\"Appellants\").  The  complaint alleged that Appellants' mis \nmanagement of the Baltimore foster care program resulted in \nthe children suffering physical abuse, sexual abuse, medical \nneglect,  and  otherwise  being  subjected to  dangerous  living \nconditions.  It further  asserted  that  Appellants'  actions  and \nfailings violated Appellees' rights under the Adoption Assis \ntance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (\"AACWA\"), 42 U.S.c. \n§ 620 e/ seq., and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  The  action \nsought equitable relief and monetary damages. \nIn 1987, after conducting extensive discovery that included \na  random  sampling review  of BCDSS  foster  care  records, \nAppellees  filed  a motion  for  a preliminary  injunction.  The \nmotion alleged that class members were at risk of suffering \nirreparable  harm  caused  by  abuse  and  neglect,  inadequate \nmedical care, and the placement of certain children in unli \ncensed homes, where they were not provided regular foster \ncare services. The motion also alleged that BCDSS had failed \nto  \"undertake  adequate  and  effective  measures  to  address \ndeficiencies  in  the  [foster  care]  system\"  revealed  by  the \nBCDSS's own review of its services. L.J. v.  Massinga, 699 F. \nSupp. 508,529 (D. Md.  1988) (\"L.J. IIf').' BCDSS's review, \nwhich was conducted by a group that became known as the \nHarris Task Force, had uncovered numerous problems. These \nincluded a shortage of foster  care  homes,  insufficient staff, \npoor training, and a general absence of adequate safeguards \n'The district court's 1987 order on the preliminary injunction (\"L.J. f') \nwas not included in the federal supplement nor published electronically. \nHowever,  the  district court's  1988 order approving  the  consent decree \n(\"L.J. Iff') included the text of the 1987 preliminary injunction order as \nan attachment. Therefore references in this opinion to the  1987 prelimi \nnary injunction order will cite to the court's 1988 published opinion in L.J. \nlfI. \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 4 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 5 of 28\n4  L.J. V.  WILBON \nand oversight to ensure the children's safety. See id. at 533-34 \n(detailing the findings of the Harris Task Force). \nFollowing  a  two-week  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district \ncourt found that Appellees had \"offered sufficient evidence to \nestablish the existence of serious systemic deficiencies in the \nBaltimore foster care system.\" Id.  at 538. These deficiencies \nincluded \"the failure to implement policies to protect children \nin foster care; the lack of an effective effort to recruit new fos \nter homes; the licensing of questionable homes; the granting \nof exceptions allowing homes that should be closed to remain \nopen; and the incomplete medical histories of children in fos \nter care.\" Id.  The district court noted that, although BCDSS \nhad made some efforts to respond to the problems highlighted \nby  the  Harris Task Force, those attempts  were  \"incomplete \nand ineffective.\" Id.  at 534. It concluded that Appellees were \n\"Iikely to  suffer severe  physical  and  emotional  injury\"  and \nthat their \"constitutional right to  protection while  in  defen \ndants' custody [was] in jeopardy.\" Jd.  at 538. \nThe  district court  also  held  that Appellees had shown a \nlikelihood of success on the merits on both their statutory and \nconstitutional claims. It found that, given the magnitude of the \nproblems  exposed  during  the  hearing  on  the  motion,  \"it \nappears unlikely that defendants will be able to prove they are \nin compliance\" with their statutory duties. Id.  at 539. It also \ndetermined that \"plaintiffs have demonstrated the existence of \na 'special relationship' with defendants such that plaintiffs are \nowed an affirmative duty of protection by defendants\" under \nthe Due Process Clause. Id. \nThe district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring \nAppellants to  submit a plan for  review  of each foster  care \nhome where there had been a report of maltreatment, conduct \nfrequent  visits  to  all  foster  homes,  implement measures  to \nimprove the medical care provided to foster children, and sub \nmit reports of all new complaints of maltreatment to the juve-\n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 5 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 6 of 28\nL.l. v. WILBON  5 \nnile court and to Appellees' attorney, together with reports of \nactions taken to address those complaints. Id.  at 540. \nAppellants challenged the entry of the preliminary injunc \ntion before this court, alleging that they were immune to dam \nage claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They argued that children \nin  foster  care  had  no  statutory  rights  that  were  privately \nenforceable.  In  addition,  they  invoked  \"the  principle  that \nimmunity  in  the  performance of discretionary duties  exists \nwhere  the  law  governing official  conduct is  unsettled\"  and \nalleged that Appellees' constitutional rights were not \"clearly \nestablished\" in a way sufficient to overcome qualified immu \nnity.  L.1.  v.  Massinga,  838  F.2d  118,  122  (4th  Cir.  1988) \n(\"L.1.

However, we found that it was unnecessary \nto reach the issue of Appellees' constitutional rights because \nAppellants'  \"statutory duty was clear and certain and there \nfore they are not entitled to invoke the immunity defense.\" Id. \nWe detailed a number of statutory duties including \"main \ntaining standards for foster family homes and child care,\" 42 \nU.S.c. § 671 (a)(1 0), \"implementation and operation of 'a case \nreview  system'\"  for  each  child,  id.  at  §§ 627(a)(2)(B), \n671(a)(16), and reporting to law enforcement any suspicion of \nabuse, neglect, or exploitation in the placement home or insti \ntution,  id.  § 671(a)(9).

We therefore upheld the injunction. \nFollowing our affirmance of the preliminary injunction, the \nparties engaged in six weeks of settlement negotiations. The \nnegotiations produced a proposed consent decree intended \"to \nsettle and resolve all claims for declaratory relief and equita \nble relief, including injunctive relief.\" L.J. 111, 699 F. Supp. at \n518-19. The district court described the decree as follows: \nThe  consent  decree  that  embodies  the  settlement \nretains substantially those measures ordered by the \n[district] court as preliminary injunctive relief. It also \nseeks  to  make  substantial  improvements  in  several \naspects  of the foster care system including placing \nlimits  on  the  number  of cases  a  worker  may  be \nresponsible for,  improving the system for providing \nmedical treatment to foster children, providing assis \ntance to natural parents that would allow children to \nremain with them thereby avoiding foster care where \npossible, and providing for a continuum of appropri \nate foster care placements including the recruitment \nof new foster homes. Different improvements are to \nbe  implemented  at  different  times;  however,  all \nimprovements are to be made within two years. \nId.  at 511. \nAfter a thorough review of its provisions, the district court \nfound that \"if properly implemented, the consent decree will \nresult in substantial and needed improvements in Baltimore's \nfoster care system, and is adequate to protect the interests of \nthese plaintiffs.\" Id.  at 515. As a result, it held the decree to \nbe \"fair, reasonable, adequate and deserving of approval.\" Id. \nat 518. \nFor the first few years, Appellants' periodic reports to the \ncourt  indicated  substantial  compliance  with  the  consent \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 7 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 8 of 28\nL.J. V. WILBON  7 \ndecree requirements.' In 2002, however, Maryland's Depart \nment of Legislative Services (\"DLS\") conducted an audit of \nBCDSS foster care services and identified a number of defi \nciencies. These included inadequate security checks for foster \nplacements, inadequate health care for the  children, and no \nschool attendance records for many of the children. Appellees \nthen  conducted  their  own  investigation,  which  revealed  a \nnumber  of  alleged  inaccuracies  in  BCDSS's  compliance \nreports to the  court.  When these inaccuracies came to  light, \nMaryland's General Assembly asked DLS to address the reli \nability of Appellants' compliance data. DLS found that \"the \nreliability of the data underlying the reported measures tested \nwas questionable with several being judged unreliable.\" S.J.A. \n170. Following the DLS review, BCDSS began addressing a \nnumber of the reporting problems. Their subsequent reports \nshowed several areas where the decree requirements were not \nbeing met. \nOver the next few  years,  the  number of available  foster \nhomes  fell  sharply.  As  a  result,  BCDSS  began  using  its \noffices  as  emergency  shelters.  In  2005  Appellees  became \naware that Appellants were using an office building located \non Gay Street in Baltimore as an overnight shelter. Appellees' \ninvestigation  of this  shelter revealed  disturbing  conditions, \nwith  children  sleeping  on  the  floor,  unable  to  shower  or \nchange  clothes,  and  subsisting  on  a diet  of fast  food.  The \ninvestigation  also  revealed  that  some  of the  children  with \nhealth problems were placed at risk by the precarious living \nconditions at the shelter. \nIn  December  2005,  Appellees  informed  Appellants  that \nthey intended to take action to address BCDSS's lack of com \npliance with the consent decree. In February 2006, Appellees \n'In 1991  the panies modified the consent decree to extend its applica \ntion to foster care cases in which children were placed with family mem \nbers. \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 8 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 9 of 28\n8  LJ. v. WILBON \nand Appellants began negotiations on potential changes to the \ndecree which continued over the next year. \nIn March 2007, Brenda Donald was appointed as the new \nsecretary of the Maryland Department of Human Resources \nand began implementing numerous reforms to the foster care \nsystem.'  She  also  became  involved  in  the  consent  decree \nnegotiations, and agreed to a number of measures that would \nallow Appellees' counsel to monitor and assess the foster care \nsystem. However, she rejected Appellees' proposal to estab \nlish an independent monitor within the Governor's office to \noversee  the  foster  care  system.  This  disagreement  brought \nnegotiations  to  a  standstill.  As  a  result,  Appellees  filed  a \nmemorandum with the district court detailing numerous alle \ngations of Appellants' noncompliance with the  1988 decree. \nThese included several examples of mistreatment of children \nin  foster  care  as  well  as  general  allegations  of inadequate \nhealth care and educational services. \n'These reforms included the implementation of the \"Place Matters\" ini \ntiative, designed to reduce the number of children in out-of-home place \nments, increase the perc-entage of placement in family settings, and reduce \nthe number of children in group homes. The initiative has resulted in sig \nnificant advances  toward those goals.  Secretary Donald also ordered a \ncase-by-case review of all children in BCDSS care, designed to identify \nbarriers to permanent placements for each child. \nSecretary Donald  further  implemented  the  \"Baltimore Rebuild\"  pro \ngram, designed to create substantial management capacity and leadership \nwithin BCDSS. As part of this initiative, she replaced the management \nteam of BCDSS and appointed a new director, Molly McGwire. During \nMcGwire's tenure, BCDSS has increased staff, reformed staff supervision, \nand created a number of new specialized senior staff positions, including \nmedical director and educational director.  Since 2007, BCDSS has also \nincreased the use of a decision-making model that involves a foster child's \nfamily, made reforms in case-worker visits, and reduced the bac-klog of \ncases involving the termination of parental rights. \nAlthough Appellants highlight the progress that has resulted from these \nreforms, they do not allege that such progress has rendered the decree \nunnecessary. \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 9 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 10 of 28\nL.1. V. W1LBON  9 \nThe district court scheduled a contempt hearing for  Sep \ntember 2008. Five days before the hearing, Appellants filed a \nreport  admitting  to  numerous  instances  of noncompliance \nwith the decree requirements, and stating:  \"the analysis pro \nvided in this report suggests several areas that need our urgent \nattention  in  the  immediate  future.\"  J.A.  419.  However,  it \nexpressed hope that the next report would \"show measurable \nimprovements in these critical areas.\" Id.  During the subse \nquent  contempt  hearing,  Appellants  approached  Appellees \nand  offered to  negotiate a  \"compliance  and  exit plan\"  that \nwould \"require verifiable data for the showing of compliance \nand exit.\" Id. at 479. The hearing was postponed pending such \nnegotiations. \nIn  June  2009,  the  parties  reached  a final  agreement  and \njointly moved for judicial approval. The joint motion stated \nthat the parties had \"reached a comprehensive settlement of \ntheir current disputes regarding the existing Consent Decree \nand  Modification that  they believe is  fair,  reasonable,  ade \nquate, and in the best interest of the Plaintiff class.\" Jd. at 634. \nShortly  after  a  final  agreement  was  reached,  however, \nAppellants asked the court to allow briefing on the potential \napplicability of the Supreme Court's then-recent decision in \nHorne v.  Flores, 129 S. Ct. 2579 (2009), which they alleged \nchanged the law in a way that deprived the district court of \nsubject matter jurisdiction to  enforce the  1988  decree.  The \ncourt held a hearing during which it preliminarily approved \nthe 2009 decree, declaring it \"not only fair\"  but also  \"com \nmendable.\"  J.A.  721.  During  the  hearing  Secretary  Donald \nalso  described  the  decree as  \"very strong.\" Id.  at 725.  The \ncourt decided to permit briefing on the subject matter jurisdic \ntion  issue and stayed the  final  entry  of the  decree  pending \nsuch briefing. \nIn September 2009, Appellants moved to vacate the  1988 \ndecree under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), which \nstates that a court may vacate a judgment or an order if: \"the \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 10 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 11 of 28\n10  LJ.

They fur \nther alleged that Horne  was  directly applicable to  this  case \nbecause,  in  Suter  v.  Artist  M,  503  U.S.  347  (1992),  the \nSupreme Court held that there was no private right of action \nunder AACW A. \nDuring the  hearing on  the  motion to  vacate,  the  district \ncourt  first  rejected  Appellants'  suggestion  that  the  court \nlacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It stated that \nthere was a \"legitimate question\" as to whether Appellees had \na right of action under Suter, and that the \"existence of a legit \nimate question confer[s] subject matter jurisdiction upon [the \ncourt].\"  1.A.  1212.  Appellants then amended their jurisdic \ntional argument, explaining: \nWe're not saying the court lacks jurisdiction in the \nsense  of the power to  say what the  law  is.  What \nwe're saying is that the court under Horne lacks ... \nthe authority to order the relief requested .... You \nhave the jurisdiction to decide the issue. \nId.  at  1217-18. \nThe court rejected Appellants'  interpretation of Horne.  It \ninstead read Horne as saying that \"it is inappropriate for a fed \neral court to grant relief in favor of the plaintiffs [if] in fact \nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that there might be \nongoing  federal  violations.\"  Id.  at  1225.  The  court  further \nfound that, because there remains a \"concern about violations \nof federal  law,\" there is \"a continuing federal  interest which \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 11 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 12 of 28\nLJ. v.

The court denied the motion to vacate the 1988 decree and \nentered the 2009 decree. This appeal followed. \nII. \nAppellants  argue  that  the  district  court erred  in  denying \ntheir motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) \nto  vacate the  1988 decree based on  intervening changes  in \ndecisional law that allegedly eliminated the legal bases for the \ndecree. They also argue that the district court erred in entering \nthe 2009 modified consent decree, because it is not based on \na valid federal claim. We address each contention in tum. \nWe review both the district court's denial  of Appellants' \nRule 60(b)(5) motion and its decision to enter the 2009 modi \nfied consent decree for abuse of discretion. See United States \nv.  North Carolina, 180 F.3d 574, 581  (4th Cir. 1999); Werner \nv.  Carbo, 731  F.2d 204, 206 (4th Cir.  1984). A district court \nabuses  its discretion only where  it  \"has  acted  arbitrarily or \nirrationally[,] ... has failed to consider judicially recognized \nfactors constraining its exercise of discretion, or when it has \nrelied on erroneous factual or legal premises.\"  United States \nv. Hedgepeth, 418 F.3d 411, 419 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal cita \ntions and quotations omitted). \nA. \nRule 60(b)(5) provides: \nOn motion and just terms, the  court may relieve a \nparty  or  its  legal  representative  from  a final judg \nment [or] order ...

Jail,  502  U.S.  367, 383  (1992).  A \nparty \"may meet its initial burden by showing either a signifi \ncant change either in factual conditions or in law\" that makes \n\"enforcement of the decree ... detrimental to the public inter \nest.\" Id.  at 384. \nAppellants argue that they are entitled to relief under Rule \n60(b)(5) because applying the consent degree prospectively is \nno  longer equitable due to significant changes in  decisional \nlaw created by Horne and Suter' They allege that Horne \"de \n1 \nmonstrate[ s  that the absence  of a federal  right  enforceable \nthrough a private right of action deprives a federal  court of \nauthority  to  enter  or  enforce  an  injunction  like  the  1988 \ndecree.\"  Appellants'  Br.  at 25.  They further assert that this \nchange requires the court to vacate the decree because, under \nthe  Supreme Court's decision  in Suter,  \"no private right of \naction  is  authorized by  the  statutes  on  which  the  plaintiffs \nbase their claims.\" Id. They argue, as a result, that \"no federal \nclaim supports ... the 1988 decree\" and that the district court \nshould therefore have vacated the decree. Id.  at 30.  For the \nreasons  discussed  below,  we  find  that  Appellants  failed  to \nmeet their burden of showing that Horne and Suter created \nchanges in the law that require vacatur of the 1988 decree.' \n5 Appellants  have  never  alleged  that  the  decree  should  be  vacated \nbecause it has been fulfilled or because it is no longer necessary. In fact, \nin September 2009, the month they filed the motion to vacate, Appellants \nreported data that showed several ongoing compliance problems. How \never, the option of seeking to have the decree vacated on the basis of com \npliance remains available to Appellants, and we express no opinion in that \nregard. \n• Appellants also argue that enforcement of the decree could not other \nwise be based on alleged due process violations because \"this Court did \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 13 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 14 of 28\nL.J. v. WILBON  13 \n1. \nHorne involved a challenge to a declaratory judgment and \nrelated injunctions entered in an action alleging that an Ari \nzona school  district was providing inadequate instruction to \nEnglish Language Learners (\"ELL\"). Plaintiffs in that action, \na group of ELL students, asserted that the district's ELL pro \ngram  violated  the  Equal  Educational  Opportunities  Act  of \n1974 (\"EEOA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f), which requires States to \ntake  \"appropriate  action  to  overcome  language  barriers\"  in \nschools. Horne,  129 S.  Ct.  at 2588.  In granting declaratory \njudgment in  favor  of plaintiffs,  the  district court found  an \nEEOA violation in the school district \"because the amount of \nfunding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL stu \ndents (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not related \nto  the  actual  funding  needed  to  cover  the  costs  of ELL \ninstruction.\" ld.  at  2589.  Six  years  after the judgment was \nentered,  the  Arizona  state  legislature  passed  H.B.  2064, \ndesigned to  increase ELL funding.  The Arizona Superinten \ndent of Public Instruction, who was a defendant, along with \nstate legislators who were permitted to intervene in the case, \nfiled a Rule 60(b )(5) motion, alleging that H.B. 2064 created \na change in circumstances that required vacatur of the original \nnot address those claims, and the 1988 decree was not based on them.\" \nAppellants' Br. at 7 n.8. Because we find that Appellants failed to show \nthat the decrees lack a statutory basis, we need not address their claim that \nthe decree was not based on Appellees' constitutional rights. \nWe note, however, that Appellants' argument before the district court \nthat Appellees'  complaint did not give rise  to cognizable due process \nclaims, which consisted of only one footnote in a reply brief, was insuffi \nciently  developed  to  establish  that contention below.  Furthennore, the \nfootnote relied solely on cases that we have since held do not foreclose the \nexistence of a constitutional right to protection for children in foster care-. \nSee Doe v. S.c.

V. WILBON \njudgment. The district court denied the motion and the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \nThe Supreme Court reversed, holding that both the district \ncourt and the Ninth Circuit had misapplied the Rule 60(b)(5) \n\"changed circumstances\" inquiry. The Court noted that Rule \n60(b)( 5)  permits  relief from  a  judgment  in  three  circum \nstances: where \"[i] the judgment has been satisfied, released \nor discharged; [ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has \nbeen reversed or vacated; or [iii] applying it prospectively is \nno longer equitable.\" ld.  at 2597 (alterations in the original). \nIt held that both courts erroneously focused only on the first \ninquiry  and  failed  to  determine  whether  application  of the \njudgment continued to  be  equitable.  The  opinion explained \nthat the equity inquiry required the courts below to  analyze \n\"whether ongoing enforcement of the original order was sup \nported by an  ongoing violation of federal  law,\" which they \nfailed to do. ld. The Court then pointed to \"important factual \nand legal changes that may warrant the granting of relief from \nthe judgment\" and remanded to the district court for \"a proper \nexamination\" of changed circumstances. Id.  at 2600. \nThe Horne opinion emphasized that the inquiry it described \nwas required under the \"flexible approach\" to Rule 60(b)(5) \nthat  courts  have  been  instructed  to  apply  when  reviewing \ninstitutional  reform  orders.  Under  that  flexible  approach, \ncourts are directed to \"ensure that 'responsibility for discharg \ning the  State's obligations is returned promptly to the State \nand its officials' when the circumstances warrant.\" ld. at 2595 \n(quoting Frew v.  Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 442 (2004».

WILBON  15 \nthat was no longer equitable because it did not flow from a \nviolation  of federal  rights.  According  to  Appellants,  the \ndecree  does  not  flow  from  a  violation  of  federal  rights \nbecause the statute on which it is based, AACW A, does not \nprovide a private right of action. Appellants base their argu \nment on a footnote in the Horne opinion, which states: \n[B]oth the District Court and the Court of Appeals \nheld  that  HB  2064's  funding  mechanism  violates \n[the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  (\"NCLB\")]. \n... Whether or not HB 2064 violates [NCLB], ... \nneither court below  was  empowered to  decide the \nissue.  As  the  Court  of Appeals  itself recognized, \nNCLB does not provide a private right of action .... \n\"Without [statutory intent], a cause  of action  does \nnot exist and courts may not create one, no matter \nhow desirable that might be  as a policy matter,  or \nhow compatible with the statute.\" Alexander v.  San \ndoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286-287 (2001). Thus, NCLB \nis  enforceable  only  by  the  agency  charged  with \nadministering it. \nId.  at  2598  n.6  (\"Footnote  6\")  (internal  citations  omitted). \nAppellants argue that Footnote 6 announced the legal princi \nple that the court is not '''empowered to decide the issue' of \nthe violation of a federal statute or to order a remedy on that \nstatute where ... the statute 'does not provide a private cause \nof action. '\"  Appellants' Br. at 24. They claim that Footnote 6 \nestablished a significant change in decisional law sufficient to \nsupport vacatur under Rule 60(b)(5). \nBecause the judgment at issue in Horne was not based on \nalleged violations of NCLB, Footnote 6 did not relate to the \nvalidity of the judgment as a legal remedy. Rather, the foot \nnote was a response to the holdings of the courts below con \ncluding that,  because  the  reforms  in  ELL  funding  through \nH.B. 2064 violated NCLB, those reforms could not render the \njudgment unnecessary.  The  footnote  simply  explained  that \n\n-----------------------------\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 16 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 17 of 28\n16  LJ. v. WILBON \nsuch a consideration was not appropriate because the courts \ncould not entertain private allegations of noncompliance with \nNCLB and therefore could not decide that issue. \nAlthough Appellants assert that Footnote 6 signifies a sig \nnificant  change  in  the  law  sufficient  to  support  a  Rule \n60(b)(5) vacatur of the  decree, neither Appellants' brief nor \nAppellants' counsel at oral argument could articulate the for \nmer  state  of the  law  that  the  Horne  footnote  allegedly \nchanged. This is likely because the proposition explained in \nFootnote 6 is hardly novel. The Supreme Court has long held \nthat private plaintiffs may not bring suits to enforce statutes \nthat do not provide a private cause of action. In fact, the case \ncited  in  Footnote  6,  Alexander v.  Sandoval,  532  U.S.  275 \n(200 I),  stands  for  that  very  proposition  by  holding  that  a \nplaintiff cannot bring a disparate impact claim under § 602 of \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the Act does \nnot provide a private right of action for such claim. See also \nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 276 (2002) (holding that \na private plaintiff may not being an action under the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 because that stat \nute does not create personal rights to enforce under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983).  Footnote  6  simply  explains  that  the  courts  below \ncould not base their decisions on private allegations of non \ncompliance with NCLB because the private plaintiffs lacked \na cause of action to bring a noncompliance challenge. \nAppellants urge us to extend the narrow legal proposition \ncontained in Footnote 6 to find that a court can retroactively \nlose authority to enforce a decree if that decree is based on a \nstatute that the Supreme Court later finds not to provide a pri \nvate cause of action.  Given that Footnote 6 did not address \neither the actual statute upon which the judgment in the case \nwas based or the court's continuing authority to enforce it, \nsuch a holding would require a significant logical leap unsup \nported by  the  footnote's  sparse  language.  Accordingly,  we \nfind that Horne did not establish a change in the law sufficient \nto support Appellants' 60(b)(5) motion. At most, Horne rein-\n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 17 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 18 of 28\nL.J. V. WILBON  17 \nforced  the  well-established  principle  that  private  plaintiffs \ncannot bring a claim to enforce a statute that lacks a private \nright of action. \n2. \nFurthermore, even if we were to accept Appellants' reading \nof Footnote  6,  their  argument  would  nonetheless  remain \nunavailing  for  other  reasons.  Appellants  allege  that,  under \nFootnote 6,  the district court here lacks authority to enforce \nthe decree because, pursuant to the Supreme Court's ruling in \nSuter,  Appellees  lack  a  private  right  of action  to  enforce \nAACW A. We first note that Suter was issued eighteen years \nago. Rule 60( c) requires that a motion for relief under Rule \n60(b)(5) be \"made within a reasonable time.\" Therefore, even \nif Suter  had  indeed  changed  the  law,  Appellants'  lengthy \ndelay in filing a motion based upon it would bring into ques \ntion the appropriateness of equitable relief. \nPerhaps more importantly, Appellants have failed to meet \nthe burden of showing that this court's decision in L.J. 11 has \nbeen overruled by Suter. Our holding in L.J. 11 that Appellees \nhad a private right of action to enforce the relevant provisions \nof AACW A is \"the law of the case\" and is therefore presump \ntively controlling, absent proof to the contrary: \nThe law of the case doctrine posits that when a court \ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should con \ntinue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages \nin the same case.  As a practical matter, then,  once \nthe decision of an appellate court establishes the law \nof the  case,  it must be followed in all  subsequent \nproceedings in the same case in the trial court or on \na later appeal ... unless: (1) a subsequent trial pro \nduces  substantially different evidence,  (2)  control \nling authority has since made a contrary decision of \nlaw applicable to the issue, or (3) the prior decision \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 18 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 19 of 28\n18  LJ.

Appellants appear \nto rely on the second prong of this analysis in arguing that \nSuter  \"made  a  contrary  decision  of law\"  by  holding  that \nAACW A  is  \"unenforceable by  foster  children  in  a private \nright  of action.\"  Appellants'  Br.  29.  We  decline  to  adopt \nAppellants' broad reading of Suter. \nAACW A \"establishes a federal reimbursement program for \ncertain expenses incurred by the States in administering foster \ncare and adoption services.\" Suter, 503 U.S. at 350-51. Under \nthe Act, a state can be \"reimbursed for a percentage of foster \ncare and adoption assistance payments when the State satis \nfies  the requirements of the Act.\" Id.  at 351. Suter involved \nallegations that the Illinois Department of Children and Fam \nily Services had violated AACWA's requirements. The spe \ncific  question  before  the  Court  was  whether  the  Seventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals had erred in holding \"that 42 U.S.c. \n§ 671(a)(15)  contained an  implied right of action,  and that \n[the plaintiffs] could enforce this section of the Act through \nan action brought under § 1983 as well.\" Id.  at 350. Suter did \nnot address  the  broader question of whether AACWA   as  a \nwhole lacked a private right of action. \nSection 671, as it existed at the time of Suter, stated in rele \nvant part: \n(a) Requisite features of State plan[.]In order for a \nState to be eligible for payments under this part, it \nshall have a plan approved by the Secretary which \n... (15) ... provides that, in each case, reasonable \nefforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a \nchild in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need \nfor removal of the child from his home, and (B) to \nmake it possible for the child to return to his home. \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 19 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 20 of 28\nL.J. V. WILBON  19 \nId.  at 351.' The Suter court found that, because there were no \nconcrete requirements and no  statutory guidance within the \nAACWA \"as to how 'reasonable efforts' are to be measured,\" \nthe section was too vague for private enforcement. Suter, 503 \nU.S. at 360. The Court also noted that the Act provided mech \nanisms for  the  Secretary of Health and  Human  Services to \nenforce the provision, and therefore \"absence of a remedy to \nprivate plaintiffs under § 1983 does not make the 'reasonable \nefforts'  clause a dead letter.\" Id.  at 360-61. In addition, the \nCourt found that although \"the Act does place a requirement \non the  States,  . . . that requirement only goes  so  far  as to \nensure that the State have a plan approved by the Secretary \nwhich contains the ... listed features.\" Id.  at 358. \nAlthough not directly at issue in the case before it, the Suter \nCourt also  found  in  a footnote  that  the  other provision  on \nwhich the plaintiffs had originally based their complaint, 42 \nU.S.C. § 671(a)(9), lacked a private right of action. The court \nnoted  that  the  provision,  which  mandates  reporting  to  the \nauthorities of \"unsuitable homes,\" \"is merely another feature \nwhich the state plan must include to be approved by the Sec-\n'The current language is slightly different, although the differences are \nnot substantive.

The provision states, in \npart: \nIn  an  action  brought to  enforce a provision  of the \nSocial Security Act [42 U.S.c. § 301  et seq.], such \nprovision is not to be deemed unenforceable because \nof its  inclusion in  a section of the Act requiring a \nState plan or specifYing the required contents of a \nState plan.  This section is  not intended to  limit or \nexpand the grounds for determining the availability \nof private actions to enforce State plan requirements \nother than by overturning any such grounds applied \nin Suter v. Artist M, 112 S. Ct. 1360 ... [T)his sec \ntion is not intended to  alter the holding in Suter v. \nArtist  M  that  section  471(a)(15)  of the  Act  [42 \nU.S.c. § 671(a)(15)) is not enforceable in a private \nright of action. \n42  U.S.c.  § 1320a-2. Therefore,  although  Congress did not \noverrule Suter,  see  White  by  White  v.  Chambliss,  112  F.3d \n731, 739 n.4 (4th Cir.  1997), it made clear that the inclusion \nof a requirement as part of a state plan was not sufficient to \nrender that requirement unenforceable by private action. \nAppellants' argument that Suter stands for the proposition \nthat no AACW A provisions are enforceable by a private party \nis unavailing. Whether a plaintiff has a right to bring an action \nunder a particular provision of AACW A requires a section \nspecific inquiry. See Blessing v.  Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 342 \n(1997) (\"[I)t is impossible to determine whether Title IV -D, \nas an undifferentiated whole, gives rise to undefined 'rights.' \nOnly when  the  complaint is  broken down  into  manageable \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 21 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 22 of 28\nL.J. v.  21 \nWILBON \nanalytic  bites  can  a  court  ascertain  whether  each  separate \nclaim satisfies the various criteria we have set forth for deter \nmining whether a federal statute creates rights. \"). The fact that \nSuter found no private right of action under § 671(a)(15) and \n§ 671 (a)(9) does not void our holding in L.J. II that the rights \nasserted by plaintiffs under § 671 (a)(16) are privately enforce \nable under 42 U.S.c. § 1983.' See L.J. 11, 838 F.2d at  123. \nSection 671(a)(16) provides that the state: \nshall have a plan approved by the Secretary which \n... provides for the development of a case plan (as \ndefined in ... [42 U.S.c. § 675(1)]) for each child \nreceiving  foster  care  maintenance  payments  under \nthe State plan and provides for a case review system \nwhich meets the requirements described in ... [42 \nU.S.c. § 675(5)(8)] with respect to each such child. \nSections  675(1)  and  675(5)(8),  in  tum,  provide  concrete \nrequirements for the content and timing of the case plans and \ncase review systems. \nAppellants argue that this  \"lone provision cannot support \n... the wide-ranging and prescriptive provisions of either the \n1988 or the 2009 injunction.\" Appellants' Reply Br. 19. How \never,  it is  well established that \"parties may agree to  provi \nsions in a consent decree which exceed the requirements of \nfederal law.\" Suter, 503 U.S. at 354 n.6 (citing Rufo, 502 U.S. \nat 389). Appellants provide no legal support for the contention \nthat a court cannot enforce a consent decree unless each and \nevery  statutory  provision  listed  in  the  plaintiffs'  complaint \ncreates a private right of action. We therefore find their con \ntention unpersuasive. \n'LJ II also relied on § 671 (a)(1 0), which we have since held not to pro \nvide a private cause of action. White by White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731, \n739 (4th CiT, 1997).lt further cited § 627(a)(2)(B), which is no longer part \nof the  statute.  Section  627(a)(2)(B)  simply  mirrored  the  case  review \nrequirement set out in § 671(a)(16). \n\n------------------\n----\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 22 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 23 of 28\n22  LJ. V. W,LBON \nEven  under  their  own  reading  of Horne's  Footnote  6, \nAppellants have not shown that vacatur was required.  They \nhave failed to establish that Suter forecloses a private plain \ntiffs  ability  to  bring  an  action  pursuant  to  42  U.S.c. \n§ 671(a)(l6)'  Accordingly,  we  cannot  say  that  the  court \nabused its discretion in denying Appellants' motion to vacate \nthe 1988 decree.\" \nB. \nAppellants also assert that the district court erred in enter \ning  the  2009  modified  consent decree,  to  which  they  ulti \nmately objected, because the decree lacked a valid legal basis.\" \nAppellants argue that the changes created by Suter and Horne \neliminated the statutory right of action upon which the 2009 \nconsent decree was based. \n9 Appellants  argue  that  we  must  reverse  the  district  court's holding \nbecause it was based on the allegedly erroneous finding that, because there \nwas  \"a  continuing  federal  interest\"  in  this  case,  it  could  \"continue  to \nenforce even  if these particular plaintiffs don't have a private right of \naction.\" J.A.  1225. However, because we find that Appellants' failure to \nmeet their burden on their Rule 60(b)(5) motion justifies the denial of the \nmotion, we need not reach that finding. In affirming the holding of the dis \ntrict court, \"[w)e arc not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by \nthe district court to support its decision, but may affirm on any grounds \napparent from the record.\" United States v. Smith, 395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th \nCir. 2005) (citation omitted). \n\"This holding does not, of course, foreclose the possibility that Appel \nlants may file other Rule 60(b)(5) motions. As we noted earlier, for exam \npic, if in the future they wish to establish that the decree has been satisfied \nand is no longer necessary, that avenue remains open to them. \n\"We note that the fact that Appellants ultimately opposed the entry of \nthe  2009 decree bears no  significance  for,  as  we  have held  \"a party's \nchange of heart regarding a settlement is not a valid basis upon which to \nrefuse approval.\" United States v. North Carolina, 180 F.3d 574, 582 (4th \nCir. 1999); see also Petty v.  Timken Corp., 849 F.2d 130, 133 (4th Cir. \n1988) (\"[S)econd thoughts ... dol) not ... establish unfairness or justify \nsetting aside an otherwise valid [settlement) agreement.\"). \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 23 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 24 of 28\nL.J. v. WILBON  23 \nWe  have held that before entering a consent decree  \"the \ncourt must satisfy itself that the agreement 'is fair, adequate, \nand reasonable' and 'is not illegal, a product of collusion, or \nagainst the public interest.'\" North Carolina, 180 F.3d at 581. \nHere, Appellants made no objection to the fairness or reason \nableness  of the  decree  provisions  themselves.  Rather,  they \nfocused only on the legal basis of the claims upon which the \ndecree rested. During the hearing on the merits of the decree, \nthe court found that the  decree  \"is not only fair,  [but] com \nmendable\" and it \"commend[ ed]  all sides for having worked \nto achieve it.\" lA. 721. The court further noted that \"but for \nthe  [Horne]  subject  matter jurisdiction  issue,  [it]  certainly \nwould approve the decree.\" Id. \nAppellants  do  not  now  challenge  the  court's  holding \nregarding the merits of the decree. Instead, they argue that the \ncourt  abused  its  discretion  by  failing  to  \"ensure  that  there \n[was]  a  substantial  federal  claim\"  supporting  the  decree. \nAppellants' Sr. 26 (citing Evans v.  City of Chicago, 10 F.3d \n474,  479 (7th Cir.  1993)). As explained above,  this  court's \nholding  that  Appellees  had  a  valid  cause  of action  under \nAACW A is \"the law of the case,\" and, as  such, the district \ncourt is entitled to follow it absent proof that it has been over \nruled or that it  is  clearly erroneous.  As  we  have previously \ndiscussed, Appellants failed to  establish  that the  holding  in \nv.s.c. \nL.J II that 42  § 671(a)(l6) provided a private cause of \naction was overruled by Suter. Nor did they establish below \nthat the finding was clearly erroneous. \nWe have held that a prior decision does not qualify for the \n\"clearly erroneous\" exception to the \"law of the case\" doctrine \n\"by being 'just maybe or probably wrong; it must ... strike \nus as wrong with the force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated \ndead fish.'\"  Franchot, 572 F.3d at  194 (citation omitted). In \nother words, it must be \"dead wrong.\" Id.  Here, Appellants \nfailed  to  show that this court's previous conclusion that 42 \nv.s.c. \n§ 671(a)(l6) provided a private cause of action was \n\"dead wrong.\"  Indeed, in their briefing to the district court, \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 24 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 25 of 28\n24  L.J. v. WILBON \nAppellants  made  no  attempt  to  analyze  the  language  of \n§ 67 I (a)(l 6) to establish that it clearly did not create a private \nright of action. Had they done so, they would have had to con \ntend with the fact that we have previously found a similar pro \nvision to create a private right of action. \nIn Pee Dee Health Care, P.A. v. Sanford, 509 F.3d 204 (4th \nCir. 2007), we analyzed a statute that, like AACWA  , required \nstates to implement a state plan  in  order to  receive federal \nfunding.  The plaintiffs in that case were rural health clinics \nthat alleged that South Carolina's state Medicaid plan, which \nthe state was required to implement in order to receive federal \nMedicaid  reimbursements,  failed  to  comply  with  federal \nrequirements.  In  particular,  they  claimed  violations  of 42 \nU.S.C. § \\396a(bb), which states: \"[T]he State plan shall pro \nvide for payment for services ... furnished by a Federally \nqualified health center and services ... furnished by a rural \nhealth clinic in accordance with the provisions of this subsec \ntion. \nn \nThe Pee Dee court first noted that, under Blessing v.  Free \nstone: \n[a]  statute creates an  enforceable right if:  (1)  Con \ngress intended that the provision in question benefit \nthe plaintiff; (2) the right ostensibly protected by the \nstatute  'is  not  so  vague  and  amorphous  that  its \nenforcement would strain judicial competence'; and \n(3)  the  statute  unambiguously  imposes  a  binding \nobligation on the states. \nPee Dee, 509 F.3d at 210 (citing Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-\n41). It then found that the section created a private right of \naction in the rural clinics because the words \"shall provide for \npayment for services ... furnished by a rural health clinic\" \nshowed that \"Congress intended the statute to benefit\" those \nclinics.ld. at 212. We also found that \"the use of 'shall pro \nvide for payment' is not unduly vague or amorphous such that \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 81  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 25 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 26 of 28\nLJ. V.  W,LBON  25 \nthe judiciary cannot enforce it.\" Id.  Finally, the court found \nthat  \"the  language  unambiguously binds  the  states  as  indi \ncated by the repeated use of 'shall. \". Jd. \nGiven  our analysis  in  Pee Dee,  we  cannot  say  that  this \ncourt's prior finding that § 671 (a) (I 6) creates a private right \nof action is \"dead wrong.\" The section dictates that a state \nshall have a plan approved by the  Secretary which \n... provides for the development of a case plan (as \ndefined in ... [42 U.S.C. § 675(1)]) for each child \nreceiving  foster  care  maintenance  payments  under \nthe State plan and provides for a case review system \nwhich  meets  the  requirements described  in  section \n... [42  U.S.c.  § 675(5)(B)]  with  respect  to  each \nsuch child. \n42 U.S.C. § 67 1( a)(I 6) (emphasis added). This court's analy \nsis in Pee Dee could arguably support a finding that the lan \nguage of § 671 (a) (I 6) clearly intends to benefit \"each child\" \nin foster care; that the plan and review requirements are not \n\"so vague  or amorphous\"  such  that the judiciary could not \nenforce them; and that the \"shall\" language clearly binds the \nstate. See Pee Dee,  509 F.3d at 210; see also Blessing, 520 \nU.S.  at 340-41. Appellants have  simply failed  to  show that \nsuch  holding  would  be  \"dead  wrong\"  under  the  Blessing \nframework. \nTo be clear, we do not now hold that § 671 (a)(l6) provides \na  private  right  of action.  We  simply  hold  that  Appellants \nfailed to show that the \"law of the case\" to that effect estab \nlished by L.J. II was overruled or \"dead wrong.\" Accordingly, \nAppellants cannot show that the district court abused its dis \ncretion by entering the 2009 decree, which was based on that \nprovision. \nIII. \nF or the reasons stated above, we \nAFFIRM \n\nCase: 09-2259  Document: 82-2  Date Filed: 01/26/2011  Page: 1 \nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 605   Filed 01/26/11   Page 27 of 28\nFILED:  January  26,  2011 \nUNITED  STATES  COURT  OF  APPEALS \nFOR  THE  FOURTH  CIRCUIT \nNo.  09-2259,  L.J.  v.

      "text": "Case 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 1 of 41\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \n(Northern Division) \nL.J., et al.,         * \n  Plaintiffs,       * \n  v.        *  Civil Action No. JFM-84-4409 \nRUTH MASSINGA, et al.,      * \n  Defendants.       * \n*  * * * * * * * * * * * *  \nMODIFIED CONSENT DECREE \nPART ONE \nI.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \nA.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Consent Decree.  In the \nevent of subsequent litigation relating to the matters in this litigation other than in an action to \nenforce this Decree, Defendants retain and have  the right to contest ju risdiction, venue, and/or \nassert other defenses.  The parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over this case until \nthe terms of this Decree are fully implemented for the purposes of (1) assuring im plementation \nand  (2) allowing any party at any tim e  to m ove  for an order seeking interpretation, \nimplementation, enforcement or modification of this Decree.   \nB.  The provisions of this Decree shall revi se the Consent Decree approved by this \nCourt September 27, 1988, and effective Augus t 6, 1988, as m odified December 12, 1991; the \norder appointing a “monitor” dated May 2, 1989; a nd the orders relating to Gay Street.  Upon \nentry of an order approving the terms of this Decree, the provisions of each of these orders shall \nno longer be in effect. \nC.  This Decree shall apply to and be binding upon the parties to this civil action, and \nupon their employees, heirs, successors-in-interest, and assigns.   \nD.  The undersigned representatives of the Plaintiffs and Defendants certify that they \nare fully authorized subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to enter into and to execute \nthe terms and conditions of this Decree and to le gally bind the parties, including all members of \nthe certified plaintiff class. \nE.  The parties agree that the Defendants’ obligation to give notice of this Decree to \nthe Plaintiff class is restricted to giving notice to their undersigned counsel by their signing and \nreceipt of this Decree, receipt of which is hereby acknowledge d.  In addition, Def endants will \nATTACHMENT A \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 2 of 41\nsend out notice of this Decree to all foster parents, to all relatives with whom the Baltimore City \nDepartment  of Social Services (“BCDSS”)  has  placed  children, to all paren ts  known to \nDefendants as having children in foster care or placed with relatives, and to the organizations to \nwhich the notice of the 1988 Consent Decree was sent or their successors.  The parties agree that \nthe expense and delay of publishing this Decree  in area newspapers is  not beneficial to the \nPlaintiff class based on the experience of the  parties prior to the entry of the 1988 Consent \nDecree.  The parties agree to ur ge the Court to adopt a stream lined and inexpensive notice and \napproval process for this Decree. \nF.  This  Decree  shall  apply  only  to  those  children  certified  as m embers  of  the \nPlaintiff class, which consists  of all children and youth placed  in the custody of the Baltim ore \nCity Department of Social Services.  This Decree creates no rights in favor of any other person.  \nWhere the Decree addresses services, procedures, rights, and benefits to third parties, such as the \nbiological parents or the caregivers of members of the Plaintiff class, those provisions accrue to \nthe benefit of the Plaintiff class and  therefore are fully enforceable by Plaintiffs.  This Decree  \ncreates no obligations or duties on the part of Defendants other than  as stated specifically in the \nDecree.  A violation of this Decree shall not create a new, independent private cause of action for \nanyone. The parties agree that this Decree does not permit enforcement proceedings on behalf of \nindividual children. \nG.  The  United States Dis trict  Court for  the  District of Maryland shall have \ncontinuing jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Decree.  This Decree shall be enf orceable to \nthe same extent as any other consent decree, excep t for the Statements of Principle set forth in \nsubsection A of each substantive section (Part Two, Sections I-V) of this Decree, which shall be \nused to interpret the Decree’s terms and requirements.  The Court retains the power to m odify \nthe terms of the Decree if the Court finds that cu rrent provisions are not adequate to achieve the \nobjectives of the Decree.  If the Court ev er finds that any Defendant, or any successor of any  \nDefendant, has failed to satisfy hi s, her, or its obligation under  this Decree, the Court shall not \norder any sanction (including the imposition of a fine or imprisonment) against or respecting that \nDefendant or against any Defendant (either to punish a Defendant for alleged non-compliance or \nto stimulate future compliance) unless the Court first finds by  a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the Defendant(s) failed to meet his, her, their or  its obligations due to some willful fault or \nlack of good faith on the part of the Defendant(s).  \nH.  This Decree is not, nor shall it be construed to be, an admission of liability on the \npart of Defendants as to the trut h of any fact alleged or the va lidity of any claim which has or \ncould have been asserted in this  case, or of the deficiency of  any defense which has or could \nhave been asserted in this case or of any  wrongdoing or liability whatsoever, nor shall this \nDecree be construed as an acknowledgment by Plaintiffs of the absence of such liability. \nI.  Upon (1) approval of this Decree by the Court, (2) entry of an Order entering the \nDecree as a binding order upon the parties, and (3) the expiration of any appeal period, Plaintiffs \nshall file a motion, consented to by Defendants, voluntarily dismissing the Consolidated Petition \nfor  Orders of Enforcem ent  and to Show Ca use  Why  Defendants Should Not Be Held In \nContempt of Consent Decree and Motion for Modification of Consent Decree.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 3 of 41\nJ.  The parties have not resolved issues pert aining to Plaintiffs’ rights to recover \nattorney’s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and reserve without prejudice all rights to \nnegotiate and, if necessary, litigate those issues at a later time. \nK.  Every  provision of this Decree is severabl e.   If any par t  of this Decree is  \ndetermined by a court to be void, illega l, unconstitutional, or otherwise unenforceable for any \nreason,  that decision shall not a ffect  the validity or legality  or  otherwise affect the other \nprovisions of the Decree, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.   \nL.  The  terms  of Part One of this Decree  (i.e.,  General Provis ions,  Verification \nActivities and Information Sharing, Dispute Resolution, Communication and Problem-Solving, \nand Termination and Exit) are substantive in nature, are binding upon the parties, and are as fully \nenforceable as are all other provisions of this Decree. \nM.  Where an additional commitment contemplates that Defendants will enter into a \ncontract, any such additional commitment is subject to the condition that Defendants must secure \nall necessary approval required by law.  Defe ndants agree to m ake best efforts to secure an y \nnecessary approval from the Maryland Departm ent of Budget and Mana gement and Maryland \nBoard of Public Works that is required by law.   \nN.  Except  as otherwise provided in this   paragraph, prior to January 1, 2011, \nPlaintiffs shall not seek relief from the C ourt concerning Defendants’ alleged non-compliance \nwith  any Outcom e  or Additional Comm itment  of  this D ecree  except  in  accordance  with \nsubsection F of Part One, Section IV, “Disput e Resolution Process.”  This lim itation does not \napply to any Additional Comm itments as to  which Defendants have not reached com pliance \nwithin six months of a stated deadline for completion. \nII.  VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATION SHARING \nA.  The parties agree that a contractor or c ontractors (the “Independent Verification \nAgent”) shall be retained at Defendants’ expense with sufficient and reasonable budget to verify \nindependently that Defendants’ reports of compliance with the requirements of the Substantive \nRequirements,  Internal Success Measures, and Ex it  Standards  sections  in Part T wo  of  this \nDecree  are accurate, valid, and re liable.   All contracts, agreem ents,  bills, and paym ent \ninformation related to the Independent Verificati on Agent shall be provided to Plaintiffs.  The  \nIndependent Verification Agent is Mark Testa. \nB.  Verification  activities  will hav e  two ke y  functions:   (1) to prov ide  accurate, \nindependent information to the Court and the parties about system performance to implement the \nrequirements of this Decree; an d (2) to provide feedback to  Defendants that supports self-\ncorrecting measures and ongoing quality improvement by Defendants.  Verification activities are \nnot  intended to supplant the day-to-day mana gement  and oversight  responsibilities  of \nDefendants.  No party, nor any employee or ag ent of any party, shall have any supervisory \nauthority over the activities, findings, and recommendations of the Independent Verification \nAgent. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 4 of 41\nC.  The Independent Verification Agent shall be  authorized to verify that:  (1) the \ndata and other inform ation reported by De fendants are accurate, valid,  and reliable; (2) the \nmeasures and methods used by Defendants to re port data and other in formation are accurate, \nvalid, and reliable; (3) Defendants have in place sufficient quality control and review processes \nto  verify accurately and regularly the accur acy  of data provided through its m anagement \ninformation systems; and (4) Defendants’ cas e review process is accurate, valid, and reliab le.  \nWhere the Independent Verification Agent determ ines that the Defendants have not provided \nsufficiently  reliable  and  accurate inform ation  to m easure  Defendants’ p erformance  on th e \nrequirements  of this Decree, the Independent   Verification Agent m ay  conduct additional  \ninformation-gathering  activities  to  obtain information  to measure  performance.   These m ay \ninclude, but are not limited to, case record reviews, quality service reviews, interviews, surveys \nof children and other stakeholders, and review of data available to Defendants.  If, after receiving \nnotice from the Independent Verification Agent of this decision, Defendants disagree with any of \nthese additional activities by the Independent Veri fication Agent, they may present the issue to \nthe Communication and Problem-Solving Forum, as provided in Part One, Section III.  Upon the \nconclusion  of the Forum ,  Defendants sha ll  accept  the final decision of the Independen t \nVerification Agent. \nD.  Subject to the provisions set forth in subsections B and C above, Defendants agree \nto provide the Independent Veri fication Agent with tim ely and reasonable access to (1) all \nindividuals within the Department of Human Resources (“DHR”), BCDSS, and any successor \nagencies  or divisions as necessary to perfor m  its duties; and (2) all docum ents,  data, and \ninterested persons, within the control of Defendants and/or accessible by Defendants, that the  \nIndependent  Verification Agent deem s  relevant  to its w ork  (including but not lim ited  to \ndocuments  and data from   contract agencies o r  partner public agencies).  The Independent \nVerification Agent agrees to resp ect the confidentiality of all information that is otherwis e \nprivileged or confidential under Maryland law.   The Independent Verification Agen t will work \nwith Defendants to ensure that its requests for access are not unduly burdensome or disruptive.  \nE.  Where an Exit Standard for an Outcome uses a defined term for that Outcome, the \nmeaning shall be incorporated into the Exit Standard for that Outcome.  The provisions of the \nDefinitions  reflect policies, procedures, an d  practices to achiev e  compliance  with the \nrequirements of this Decree.  The p arties recognize that evidence of the Defendants'  actions or \ninaction concerning these policies, procedures and practices  may be relevant in a proceeding \ninvolving  a petition by Plainti ffs  for a determination of non- compliance  with the relevant  \nOutcome under subsection C of Part One, Secti on V “Termination and Exit,” or in a judicial \nproceeding concerning the Defendants' compliance with this Decree.  In estab lishing a remedy \nfor  non-compliance with an Outcom e,  the C ourt  may  compel  compliance  with policies, \nprocedures and practices in the relevant Definition. \n \nF.  The Plaintiffs shall have access to the following: \n1.  Through the Independent Verification Agent, Plaintiffs’ counsel shall have \naccess to all information considered by the Independent Verification Agent, for purposes \nof ensuring compliance with, and enforcing, the Decree.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 5 of 41\n2.  In connection with a proceeding on behalf of the class or a group of class \nmembers to enforce this Decree, Plaintiffs’ counsel shall have timely access to those class \nmembers’ case files and the case files for the class members’ foster homes and families \nof origin, whether in paper  or electronic copy, and any other docum ents referencing or \nconcerning the class members with redactions only for identity of named reporters of \nabuse or neglect or for good faith assertions  by Defendants of work product or attorney \nclient privilege.   \n3.  If  Plaintiffs’ attorneys present a  dispute  arising under this Decree \ninvolving  a group of class m embers,  Plaintiffs  may  request access to those class \nmembers’ case files and the case files for the class members’ foster homes and families \nof origin, whether in paper  or electronic copy, and any other docum ents referencing or \nconcerning the class members with redactions only for identity of named reporters of \nabuse or neglect or for good faith assertions  by Defendants of work product or attorney \nclient privilege.  If Defendants object to produc ing those case files, Plaintiffs shall bring \ntheir  request to the C ommunication  and  Problem-Solving  Forum for the process \ndescribed in Part One, Section III. \n4.  Within one working day, Plaintiffs’ counsel shall be notified of the serious \ninjury or death of any class member and shall be provided timely the incident report, any \nreports of the investigative outcomes, and access to the child’s case file. \n5.  Defendants shall promptly provide to the Independent Verification Agent \nand to Plaintiffs’ counsel all publicly available reports that Defendants receive indicating \nthat they are not in compliance with a requirement of this Decree.   \n \n6.  Plaintiffs  will no t  use  the Public   Information  Act (“PI A”)  to see k \ninformation available to Plaintiffs pursuant to subparagraphs F (1)-(5) of this Section II. \nBefore filing a request for information under the PIA, Plaintiffs shall bring their request \nto the Communication and Problem-Solving Forum for the process described in Part One, \nSection  III and for t he  Forum  Facilitator  to  confirm  that the request m eets  the \nrequirements of this subparagraph.  This para graph shall not apply if Plaintiffs’ counsel \nhas a good faith belief that a group of class members is suffering or will suffer irreparable \nharm, and the PIA request seeks information that is relevant to that harm. \nG.  Any reports by the Independent V erification Agent shall be public docum ents, \nexcept that any individually identifiable information (as that term is understood under Maryland \nlaw) and any other confidential or privileged  information protected from disclosure by law, \nincluding without limitation any protected health information and/or individually identifiable \nhealth information (as those terms are understood under HIPAA) shall be  redacted or otherwise \nremoved from any public report.  \nH.  The  parties  shall promptly subm it  to th e  U.S. Distric t  Court the te rms  of a \nprotective  order providing the Independent V erification  Agent, the   Forum  Facilitator  (as \nnecessary to carry out his or her duties as set fort h in Part One, Section III), Plaintiffs’ counsel, \ntheir  agents,  and their em ployees  access  to c onfidential  information  concerning  the class \nmembers and their families, except as otherwise provided in this Decree.  The parties shall also \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 6 of 41\nsubmit to the Baltimore City Circuit Court, sitting as a Juvenile Court, a protective order to allow \nand provide the Independent Verification Agent and Plaintiffs’ counsel with access to QUEST \nrecords for class members as required by this Decree.  Either party may advise the courts of any \npotential issue relating to the lawfulness of the  proposed protective orders, but both parties shall \notherwise advocate for entry of the proposed protective orders. \nI.  If at any point the Independent Verification Agent can no longer serve, the parties \nshall agree on another Independent Verification  Agent, with input and recomm endations from \nthe outgoing Independent Verification Agent.  If the parties are unable to come to a joint \ndecision  on a successor Independent Verification  Agent  within thirty days, or longer by \nagreement of the parties, the parties shall consult with the Forum  Facilitator in an attem pt to \nreach an agreement.  If the parties still cannot agree, the Court will have the authority to make a \nfinal decision.  Either party may report to the Court a recommendation of the Forum Facilitator. \nJ.  Every six months, Defendants shall subm it to the Court, with a copy to the \nPlaintiffs, a report addressing th eir performance under the Internal Success Measures and Exit \nStandards and compliance with the Additional Commitments of Part Two of this Decree, based \nupon data reflecting performance for the six-month period covered by that report.  The report \nshall contain a certification by the Independent Verification Agent  as to the accuracy of the \nreport or a statement by the Independent Verification Agent of the portions of the report that are \nnot certified and the reasons why they have not been certified. \nK.  The parties will use the  Communication and Problem-Solving Forum (described \nin Part One, Section III) immediately followi ng the issuance of a report by the Defendants to \naddress concerns that Plaintiffs may have regarding the report.  In those circumstances when the \nForum does not resolve Plaintiffs ’ concerns, Plaintiffs may file a responsive report with the \nCourt without going through the Dispute Resolution pr ocess (described in Part One, Section IV \nbelow).  Plaintiffs’ decision not to bring an issue  to the Forum or not to file a responsive report \nwith the Court shall not act as a waiver of any kind and shall not be construed as acquiescing to \nthe Defendants’ report.   \nIII.  COMMUNICATION AND PROBLEM-SOLVING FORUM \nA.  The Parties agree that regular communica tion between them is critical to the \nsuccessful resolution of this case and further  agree to establish a communication and problem \nsolving forum (the “Forum ”) for the purpose of  addressing issues that arise relating to the \nDecree.  The parties agree to us e the Forum in good faith to negotia te resolutions of issues and \ndisputes within the scope of the Forum. \nB.  Membership  in the Forum   shall include   Plaintiffs’ counsel and Defe ndants’ \ncounsel and representatives, and an  identified outside facilitator(s)  (the “Forum Facilitator”).  \nThe Independent Verification Agent may attend meetings as it deems relevant to its work and \nshall attend meetings related to its findings or anal yses or at the request of either party or the \nForum Facilitator.   \nC.  Forum meetings will occur quarterly to discuss progress related to the Decree, and \nif, upon request by a party, the Fo rum Facilitator determines that a particular issue requires an \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 7 of 41\nimmediate Forum meeting.  The F orum Facilitator will chair the Foru m meetings and take \nminutes of the m eetings.  From time to time, other employees of Defendants and other child \nwelfare stakeholders may be invited to the m eetings upon the request of  either Plaintiffs or \nDefendants.  Where there is disagreement, the Forum Facilitator will decide whether to exclude \nexternal stakeholders.  \nD.  In addition to Forum meetings, the parties agree to hold regular comm unications \nabout the Decree, com pliance issues, violations, a nd other issues of importance to Plaintiffs.   \nForum meetings should not repl ace these regular communications between the p arties.  The \nForum Facilitator will be copied on all regular and electronic mail between the parties.   \nE.  By  December  31, 2009, Defendants, after consultation with the Internal \nVerification Agent, Plaintiffs’ coun sel and stakeholders, shall establish a standardized process \nfor resolving issues related to individual class members.  This process shall be widely publicized \nand accessible and shall permit individuals or their counsel to ra ise concerns about problems in \ntheir individual cases wit hout retaliation (or fear  of retaliation).  Record s shall be kept of the  \nissues  raised  and th eir  resolutions,  and summ ary  reports shall be provi ded  to  the Inte rnal \nVerification Agent and Plaintiffs’ counsel every six months. \nF.  The Forum Facilitator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties to  \nserve for a term of one calendar year, subject to renewal by mutual  agreement of the parties.  If \nthe agreement with the Forum Facilitator is not renewed, the parties shall mutually agree upon a \nnew Forum Facilitator.  If the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty days of the end \nof the agreement, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties,  they shall mediate the \ndispute with the assistance of the Court.   \nG.  The Forum Facilitator shall be retained at  Defendants’ expense.  All contracts, \nagreements, bills, and payment information related to the Forum Facilitator shall be provided to \nPlaintiffs.  No party, nor any em ployee or agent of any party, shall have any supervisory \nauthority over the Forum Facilitator.   \nIV.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n  In the event that Plaintiffs identify an ar ea in which they asser t Defendants are not in \ncompliance with the Decree: \nA.  Plaintiffs shall, prior to seeking judicial relief, notify Defendants and the Forum \nFacilitator in writing of the compliance issue.   \nB.  Within twenty calendar days of Plainti ffs’ notification, Defendants shall respond \nin writing to Plaintiffs and the Forum Facilitator as to (1) whether they disagree with any of the \nfacts and issues raised in Plain tiffs’ written notice; (2) the basis for each such in stances of \ndisagreement; and (3) what actions , if any, they propose to take  with regard to the issue of  \nalleged non-compliance.   \nC.  Regardless  of whether Defendants agre e  with Plaintiffs’ assertion of non-\ncompliance, the parties shall meet with the Forum Facilitator within fifteen calendar days of the \nDefendants’ response, unless otherwise agreed to  by the parties.  The purpose of this m eeting \nshall be for the parties to enga ge in good faith negotiations with  the assistance of the Forum \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 8 of 41\nFacilitator to determine whether additional actions are necessary to address Plaintiffs’ assertion \nof non-compliance.  The parties shall engage in negotiations for a period not to ex ceed twenty \ncalendar days, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.   \nD.  At the conclusion of the dis pute resolution process, if the parties have failed to \ncome to an agreement, either party may request the Forum Facilitator to analyze the issues raised \nby Plaintiffs and the Defendants’ response, and prepare and issue a report with recommendations \nconcerning the dispute.  The repo rt shall be i ssued no later than ten days after the dispute  \nresolution process has ended.  This  report shall be provided to the parties and, at the request of \neither party, to the Court.   \nE.  At the end of the dispute resolution pe riod, or the period as extended by m utual \nagreement of the parties, either party may seek relief from the Court. \nF.  Notwithstanding the dispute resolution process described above, if immediate and \nirreparable harm to a group of children will re sult from Defendants’ non-compliance with the \nDecree, Plaintiffs may directly petition the Court for appropria te relief without following the \nprocess required by this Section IV.   \nV.  TERMINATION AND EXIT \nA.  Defendants  shall be in com pliance  with  an Outcom e  of this Decree after \nDefendants  have subm itted  periodic certified re ports  showing, with certification by th e \nIndependent Verification Agent, that Defendants  have met the identified Exit Standards for that \nOutcome for three consecutive six-month reporting periods. \nB.  Once  certified compliance  with an  Outcome  has been achieved, the periodic \nreports required by subsection J of Part One, Section II, “Verification Activities,” will no longer \nbe required, nor will verification by the Independent Verification Agent of compliance with the \nOutcome be required.  I nstead, the Defendants will continue to measure compliance with the \nOutcome and will incorporate reporting on the Outcome in quarterly public management reports.  \nDefendants shall notify the Independ ent Verification Agent, with a copy to Plaintiffs, if their \ncompliance with an Outcome or the methodology for reporting on an Outcome changes. \nC.  If, following Defendants’ achievement of  certified compliance with an Outcome, \nDefendants’ performance falls eight points below the Exit Standards (for example, 82 percent if \nthe metric for the Exit Standard is 90 percent) for two successive six- month reporting periods, \nPlaintiffs may petition the Independent Verification Agent to determine non-compliance.  If the \nIndependent Verification Agent determines that Defendants have failed to maintain compliance \nwith the Outcome, the Defendants shall be deemed to no longer be in certified com pliance with \nthat Outcome and shall again be required to report on that Outcom e under subsection J of Part \nOne, Section II, “Verification Activities,” until the requirements for certified compliance under \nparagraph A of this Section have been met.  \nD.  The Defendants shall continue to report on their compliance with the Additional \nCommitments until the Court vacates the Decree. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 9 of 41\n  E.  After January 1, 2011, Defendants may petition the Court to modify or remove an \nExit Standard on the grounds that  it should not be required due  to significantly changed or \nunforeseen circumstances. \n  F.  Upon application of the Defendants,  the Decree shall be v acated by the Court \nwhen Defendants are in certified compliance with each Outcome. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 556-1   Filed 06/22/09   Page 10 of 41\nPART TWO:  SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS AND EXIT STANDARDS \nI.  PRESERVATION & PERMANENCY PLANNING \nA.  Statement of Principle:  Children should remain with their families if they can do so \nsafely.  Out-of-Home Placement (“OHP”) should be temporary, with a goal of providing a safe, \nnurturing, permanent home for the child as quickly as possible.

Mot.”). \nThe Modified Consent Decree (“MCD”) entered by the Court on October 9, 2009 names \nMark Testa as the parties’ “Independent Verification Agent” (“IVA”).  Defendants have asked \nPlaintiffs to agree to ask the Court to amend the MCD to replace Mark Testa with Rhonda \nLipkin, who presently serves as co-counsel for Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have agreed.  \nThe  Attorney  General  has  raised  concerns  that  Defendants  lack  protection  against \npotential partiality by Ms. Lipkin should she become the IVA and also has raised concerns about \nactual or potential conflicts of interest arising out of Ms. Lipkin’s former role as counsel for \nPlaintiffs.  Plaintiffs disagree with the Attorney General’s positions.  Nevertheless, the parties \nhave agreed to amend the MCD to address those concerns, and they ask the Court to amend the \nMCD accordingly.  In addition, because the Plaintiffs’ counsel lack authority to bind the class to \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 614-1   Filed 08/19/11   Page 2 of 3\nany waiver of potential conflicts absent Court approval, Plaintiffs’ counsel ask the Court to \nwaive any actual or potential conflicts or other concerns affecting the class that could arise from \nMs. Lipkin’s change of status.  \nTherefore, in addition to substituting Ms. Lipkin for Dr. Testa, the parties propose the \nfollowing amendments.  \nFirst, Part II, Section A of the MCD would be amended to provide that Ms. Lipkin will \nserve as IVA for an initial term of eighteen months.  (Jt. Mot. ¶ 1).  The parties will not be able \nto contest her status during this term.  Thereafter, if the parties mutually agree, Ms. Lipkin will \ncontinue  as  IVA.    Id.    If,  after  consultation,  the  parties  do  not  mutually  agree  to  her\nreappointment, Ms. Lipkin’s non-reappointment will be final and will not be subject to judicial \nreview.  Id.  \nSecond, the dispute resolution provisions of the MCD (Part II, Section K, and Part IV, \nSections A through D) would be amended to give the Defendants the right to ask the Forum \nFacilitators to review adverse certification decisions by the IVA and to allow for judicial review \nthereafter.  (Jt. Mot. ¶¶ 2-3).\nThird, the parties have agreed that, during the time that she serves as IVA, Ms. Lipkin \nwould not testify in person on behalf of Plaintiffs as to pre-IVA-appointment matters but could \ninstead submit an affidavit concerning her knowledge or opinions of events up to the effective \ndate of the Court’s Order if requested to do so by Plaintiffs.  (Jt. Mot. ¶ 4).  \nThrough the Joint Motion, Defendants have waived any conflict or other ethical concern \narising from the appointment of co-counsel for Plaintiffs as the IVA.  In this regard, however, \nbecause of the potential ethical issues that the Attorney General asserts could arise as a result of \n2\n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 614-1   Filed 08/19/11   Page 3 of 3\nMs. Lipkin’s appointment as IVA, the Defendants’ consent to the appointment is conditioned on \nthe Court’s acceptance of each of the proposed modifications.\nFinally, Plaintiffs’ counsel cannot bind the Plaintiff class for any waiver of any conflict \nor ethical concerns that could arise (should it be required) and therefore ask the Court to waive \nany such concerns on behalf of the class.  \nCONCLUSION\nThe Court should grant the Joint Motion and enter the proposed Order.  \nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Douglas Gansler\nMitchell Y.

GENERAL PROVISIONS \nA.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Consent Decree.  In the \nevent of subsequent litigation relating to the matters in this litigation other than in an action to \nenforce this Decree, Defendants retain and have the right to contest jurisdiction, venue, and/or \nassert other defenses. The parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over this case until \nthe terms of this Decree are fully implemented for the purposes of (1) assuring implementation \nand  (2)  allowing  any  party  at  any  time  to  move  for  an  order  seeking  interpretation, \nimplementation, enforcement or modification of this Decree. \nB.  The provisions of this Decree shall revise the Consent Decree approved by this \nCourt September 27,  1988, and effective August 6, 1988, as modified December 12,1991; the \norder appointing a \"monitor\" dated May 2,  1989; and the orders relating to Gay Street.  Upon \nentry of an order approving the terms of this Decree, the provisions of each of these orders shall \nno longer be in effect. \nC.  This Decree shall apply to and be binding upon the parties to this civil action, and \nupon their employees, heirs, successors-in-interest, and assigns. \nD.  The undersigned representatives of the Plaintiffs and Defendants certify that they \nare fully authorized subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to enter into and to execute \nthe terms and conditions of this Decree and to legally bind the parties, including all members of \nthe certified plaintiff class. \nE.  The parties agree that the Defendants' obligation to give notice of this Decree to \nthe Plaintiff class is restricted to giving notice to their undersigned counsel by their signing and \nreceipt of this Decree, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.  In addition, Defendants will \nATTACHMENT A \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 2 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 2 of 41 \nsend out notice of this Decree to all foster parents, to all relatives with whom the Baltimore City \nDepartment  of Social  Services  (\"BCDSS\")  has  placed  children,  to  all  parents  known  to \nDefendants as having children in foster care or placed with relatives, and to the organizations to \nwhich the notice of the 1988 Consent Decree was sent or their successors.  The parties agree that \nthe  expense and  delay of publishing this  Decree  in  area  newspapers  is  not beneficial  to  the \nPlaintiff class based on  the experience of the  parties prior to  the entry of the  1988  Consent \nDecree.  The parties agree to urge the Court to adopt a streamlined and inexpensive notice and \napproval process for this Decree. \nF.  This  Decree  shall  apply  only  to  those  children  certified  as  members  of the \nPlaintiff class, which consists of all children and youth placed in the custody of the Baltimore \nCity Department of Social Services.  This Decree creates no rights in favor of any other person. \nWhere the Decree addresses services, procedures, rights, and benefits to third parties, such as the \nbiological parents or the caregivers of members of the Plaintiff class, those provisions accrue to \nthe benefit of the Plaintiff class and therefore are fully enforceable by Plaintiffs.  This Decree \ncreates no obligations or duties on the part of Defendants other than as stated specifically in the \nDecree.  A violation of this Decree shall not create a new, independent private cause of action for \nanyone. The parties agree that this Decree does not permit enforcement proceedings on behalf of \nindividual children. \nG.  The  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Maryland  shall  have \ncontinuing jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Decree.  This Decree shall be enforceable to \nthe same extent as any other consent decree, except for the Statements of Principle set forth  in \nsubsection A of each substantive section (Part Two, Sections [-V) of this Decree, which shall be \nused to interpret the Decree's terms and requirements.  The Court retains the power to modify \nthe terms of the Decree if the Court finds that current provisions are not adequate to achieve the \nobjectives of the Decree.  If the Court ever finds that any Defendant, or any successor of any \nDefendant, has failed to satisfy his, her, or its obligation under this Decree, the Court shall not \norder any sanction (including the imposition of a fine or imprisonment) against or respecting that \nDefendant or against any Defendant (either to punish a Defendant for alleged non-compliance or \nto stimulate future compliance) unless the Court first finds by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the Defendant(s) failed to meet his, her, their or its obligations due to some willful fault or \nlack of good faith on the part of the Defendant(s). \nH.  This Decree is not, nor shall it be construed to be, an admission of liability on the \npart of Defendants as to the truth of any fact alleged or the validity of any claim which has or \ncould have been assel1ed  in  this case, or of the deficiency of any defense which has or could \nhave  been  asserted  in  this case or of any  wrongdoing or  liability  whatsoever,  nor shall this \nDecree be construed as an acknowledgment by Plaintiffs of the absence of such liability. \nI.  Upon (1) approval of this Decree by the Court, (2) entry of an Order entering the \nDecree as a binding order upon the parties, and (3) the expiration of any appeal period, Plaintiffs \nshall file a motion, consented to by Defendants, voluntarily dismissing the Consolidated Petition \nfor  Orders  of Enforcement  and  to  Show  Cause  Why  Defendants  Should  Not  Be  Held  In \nContempt of Consent Decree and Motion for Modification of Consent Decree. \n2 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 3 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 3 of 41 \nJ.  The parties  have  not resolved  issues  pertaining  to  Plaintiffs'  rights to  recover \nattorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and reserve without prejudice all rights to \nnegotiate and, if necessary, I itigate those issues at a later time. \nK.  Every  provision  of this  Decree  is  severable.  If any  part  of this  Decree  is \ndetermined by a court to be void, illegal, unconstitutional, or otherwise unenforceable for any \nreason,  that  decision  shall  not  affect  the  validity  or  legality  or  otherwise  affect  the  other \nprovisions ofthe Decree, all of which shall remain in full force and effect. \nL.  The  terms  of Part  One  of this  Decree  (i.e.,  General  Provisions,  Verification \nActivities and Information Sharing, Dispute Resolution, Communication and Problem-Solving, \nand Termination and Exit) are substantive in nature, are binding upon the parties, and are as fully \nenforceable as are all other provisions of this Decree. \nM.  Where an additional commitment contemplates that Defendants will enter into a \ncontract, any such additional commitment is subject to the condition that Defendants must secure \nall  necessary approval required  by  law.  Defendants agree to make best efforts to secure any \nnecessary approval from  the Maryland  Department of Budget and Management and Maryland \nBoard of Public Works that is required by law. \nN.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  paragraph,  prior  to  January  1,  2011, \nPlaintiffs shall not seek relief from  the Court concerning Defendants' alleged non-compliance \nwith  any  Outcome  or  Additional  Commitment  of this  Decree  except  in  accordance  with \nsubsection F of Part One, Section IV, \"Dispute Resolution Process.\"  This limitation does not \napply to any Additional Commitments as to which Defendants have not reached compliance \nwithin six months ofa stated deadline for completion. \nII.  VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATION SHARING \nA.  The parties agree that a contractor or contractors (the \"Independent Verification \nAgent\") shall be retained at Defendants' expense with sufficient and reasonable budget to verify \nindependently that Defendants' reports of compliance with the requirements of the Substantive \nRequirements,  Internal  Success  Measures,  and  Exit  Standards  sections  in  Part Two  of this \nDecree  are  accurate,  valid,  and  reliable.  All  contracts,  agreements,  bills,  and  payment \ninformation related to the Independent Verification Agent shall be provided to Plaintiffs.  The \nIndependent Verification Agent is Mark Testa. \nB.  Verification  activities  will  have  two  key  functions:  (1)  to  provide  accurate, \nindependent information to the Court and the parties about system performance to implement the \nrequirements  of this  Decree;  and  (2)  to  provide  feedback  to  Defendants that supports self \ncorrecting measures and ongoing quality improvement by Defendants.  Verification activities are \nnot  intended  to  supplant  the  day-to-day  management  and  oversight  responsibilities  of \nDefendants.  No party, nor any employee or agent of any party,  shall  have any supervisory \nauthority  over the  activities,  findings, and  recommendations of the  Independent Verification \nAgent. \n3 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 4 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 4 of 41 \nC.  The Independent Verification Agent shall be authorized to verify that:  (l) the \ndata and  other  information  reported  by  Defendants are accurate,  valid,  and  reliable;  (2)  the \nmeasures and  methods used  by Defendants to report data and other information are accurate, \nvalid, and reliable; (3) Defendants have in place sufficient quality control and review processes \nto  verify  accurately  and  regularly  the  accuracy  of data  provided  through  its  management \ninformation systems; and (4) Defendants' case review process is accurate, valid, and  reliable. \nWhere the Independent Verification Agent determines that the Defendants have not provided \nsufficiently  reliable  and  accurate  information  to  measure  Defendants'  performance  on  the \nrequirements  of this  Decree,  the  Independent  Verification  Agent  may  conduct  additional \ninformation-gathering  activities to  obtain  information  to  measure  performance.  These  may \ninclude, but are not limited to, case record reviews, quality service reviews, interviews, surveys \nof children and other stakeholders, and review of data available to Defendants.  If, after receiving \nnotice from the Independent Verification Agent of this decision, Defendants disagree with any of \nthese additional activities by the Independent Verification Agent, they may present the issue to \nthe Communication and Problem-Solving Forum, as provided in Part One, Section III.  Upon the \nconclusion  of the  Forum,  Defendants  shall  accept  the  final  decision  of  the  Independent \nVerification Agent. \nD.  Subject to the provisions set forth in subsections Band C above, Defendants agree \nto  provide the  Independent Verification  Agent with  timely and  reasonable  access  to  (1)  all \nindividuals within the Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\"), BCDSS, and any successor \nagencies  or  divisions  as  necessary  to  perform  its  duties;  and  (2)  all  documents,  data,  and \ninterested persons, within the control of Defendants and/or accessible by Defendants, that the \nIndependent  Verification  Agent  deems  relevant  to  its  work  (including  but  not  limited  to \ndocuments  and  data  from  contract agencies  or  partner  public  agencies).  The  Independent \nVerification  Agent  agrees  to  respect the  confidentiality  of all  information  that  is  otherwise \nprivileged or confidential under Maryland law.  The Independent Verification Agent will work \nwith Defendants to ensure that its requests for access are not unduly burdensome or disruptive. \nE.  Where an Exit Standard for an Outcome uses a defined term for that Outcome, the \nmeaning shall be incorporated into the Exit Standard for that Outcome.  The provisions of the \nDefinitions  reflect  policies,  procedures,  and  practices  to  achieve  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of this Decree.  The parties recognize that evidence of the Defendants' actions or \ninaction concerning these policies, procedures and  practices may be relevant in  a proceeding \ninvolving  a  petition  by  Plaintiffs  for  a  determination  of non-compliance  with  the  relevant \nOutcome under subsection C of Part One, Section V \"Termination and Exit,\" or in  a judicial \nproceeding concerning the Defendants' compliance with this Decree.  In establishing a remedy \nfor  non-compliance  with  an  Outcome,  the  Court  may  compel  compliance  with  policies, \nprocedures and practices in the relevant Definition. \nF.  The Plaintiffs shall have access to the following: \n1.  Through the Independent Verification Agent, Plaintiffs' counsel shall have \naccess to all information considered by the Independent Verification Agent, for purposes \nof ensuring compliance with, and enforcing, the Decree. \n4 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 5 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 5 of 41 \n2.  In connection with a proceeding on behalf of the class or a group of class \nmembers to enforce this Decree, Plaintiffs' counsel shall have timely access to those class \nmembers' case files and the case files for the class members' foster homes and families \nof origin, whether in  paper or electronic copy, and any other documents referencing or \nconcerning the class members with  redactions only for  identity of named  reporters of \nabuse or neglect or for good faith assertions by Defendants of work product or attorney \nclient privilege. \n3.  If  Plaintiffs'  attorneys  present  a  dispute  arising  under  this  Decree \ninvolving  a  group  of class  members,  Plaintiffs  may  request  access  to  those  class \nmembers' case files and the case files for the class members' foster homes and families \nof origin, whether in  paper or electronic copy, and any other documents referencing or \nconcerning the class  members with  redactions only for  identity of named  reporters of \nabuse or neglect or for good faith assertions by Defendants of work product or attorney \nclient privilege.  ]f Defendants object to producing those case files, Plaintiffs shall bring \ntheir  request  to  the  Communication  and  Problem-Solving  Forum  for  the  process \ndescribed in Part One, Section Ill. \n4.  Within one working day, Plaintiffs' counsel shall be notified of the serious \ninjury or death of any class member and shall be provided timely the incident report, any \nreports of the investigative outcomes, and access to the child's case file. \n5.  Defendants shall promptly provide to the Independent Verification Agent \nand to Plaintiffs' counsel all publicly available reports that Defendants receive indicating \nthat they are not in compliance with a requirement of this Decree. \n6.  Plaintiffs  will  not  use  the  Public  Information  Act  (\"PIA\")  to  seek \ninformation available to Plaintiffs pursuant to subparagraphs F (1)-(5) of this Section II. \nBefore filing a request for information under the PIA, Plaintiffs shall bring their request \nto the Communication and Problem-Solving Forum for the process described in Part One, \nSection  lIT  and  for  the  Forum  Facilitator  to  confirm  that  the  request  meets  the \nrequirements of this subparagraph.  This paragraph shall not apply if Plaintiffs' counsel \nhas a good faith belief that a group of class members is suffering or will suffer irreparable \nharm, and the PIA request seeks information that is relevant to that harm. \nG.  Any  reports by  the Independent Verification Agent shall  be  public documents, \nexcept that any individually identifiable information (as that term is understood under Maryland \nlaw)  and  any  other confidential  or privileged  information  protected  from  disclosure  by  law, \nincluding without  limitation  any  protected  health information  and/or  individually  identifiable \nhealth information (as those terms are understood under HIPAA) shall be redacted or otherwise \nremoved from any public report. \nH.  The  parties  shall  promptly  submit  to  the  U.S.  District  Court  the  terms  of a \nprotective  order  providing  the  Independent  Verification  Agent,  the  Forum  Facilitator  (as \nnecessary to carry out his or her duties as set forth in Part One, Section Ill), Plaintiffs' counsel, \ntheir  agents,  and  their  employees  access  to  confidential  information  concerning  the  class \nmembers and their families, except as otherwise provided in this Decree.  The parties shall also \n5 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 6 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 6 of 41 \nsubmit to the Baltimore City Circuit Court, sitting as a Juvenile Court, a protective order to allow \nand provide the Independent Verification Agent and Plaintiffs' counsel with access to QUEST \nrecords for class members as required by this Decree.  Either party may advise the courts of any \npotential issue relating to the lawfulness of the proposed protective orders, but both parties shall \notherwise advocate for entry of the proposed protective orders. \n1.  If at any point the Independent Verification Agent can no longer serve, the parties \nshall agree on another Independent Verification Agent, with input and recommendations from \nthe  outgoing  Independent  Verification  Agent.  If the  parties  are  unable to  come to  a joint \ndecision  on  a  successor  Independent  Verification  Agent  within  thirty  days,  or  longer  by \nagreement of the parties, the parties shall consult with the Forum Facilitator in an attempt to \nreach an agreement.  lfthe parties still cannot agree, the Court will have the authority to make a \nfinal decision.  Either party may report to the Court a recommendation of the Forum Facilitator. \nJ.  Every  six  months,  Defendants  shall  submit  to  the Court,  with  a  copy  to  the \nPlaintiffs, a report addressing their performance under the Internal Success Measures and Exit \nStandards and compliance with the Additional Commitments of Part Two of this Decree, based \nupon data reflecting performance for the six-month period covered by that report.  The report \nshall contain a certification by  the Independent Verification Agent as to the accuracy of the \nreport or a statement by the Independent Verification Agent of the portions of the report that are \nnot certified and the reasons why they have not been certified. \nK.  The parties will use the Communication and Problem-Solving Forum (described \nin Part One, Section III) immediately following the issuance of a report by the Defendants to \naddress concerns that Plaintiffs may have regarding the report.  In those circumstances when the \nForum does not resolve  Plaintiffs' concerns, Plaintiffs  may file a responsive report with the \nCourt without going through the Dispute Resolution process (described in Part One, Section IV \nbelow).  Plaintiffs' decision not to bring an issue to the Forum or not to file a responsive report \nwith the Court shall not act as a waiver of any kind and shall not be construed as acquiescing to \nthe Defendants' report. \nIII.  COMMUNICATION AND PROBLEM-SOLVING FORUM \nA.  The Parties agree that  regular communication  between  them  is  critical  to  the \nsuccessful resolution of this case and further agree to establish a communication and problem \nsolving  forum  (the  \"Forum\")  for  the  purpose of addressing  issues  that arise  relating to  the \nDecree.  The parties agree to use the Forum in good faith to negotiate resolutions of issues and \ndisputes within the scope of the Forum. \nB.  Membership  in  the  Forum  shall  include  Plaintiffs'  counsel  and  Defendants' \ncounsel  and  representatives, and an  identified outside facilitator(s) (the \"Forum Facilitator\"). \nThe Independent Verification Agent may attend meetings as it deems relevant to its work and \nshall attend meetings related to its findings or analyses or at the request of either party or the \nForum Facilitator. \nC.  Forum meetings will occur quarterly to discuss progress related to the Decree, and \nif, upon request by a party, the Forum Facilitator determines that a particular issue requires an \n6 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 7 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 7 of 41 \nimmediate  Forum  meeting.  The Forum  Facilitator  will  chair  the  Forum  meetings  and  take \nminutes of the meetings.  From time to time, other employees of Defendants and other child \nwelfare stakeholders  may  be  invited  to the  meetings  upon  the  request of either Plaintiffs or \nDefendants.  Where there is disagreement, the Forum Facilitator will decide whether to exclude \nexternal stakeholders. \nD.  In addition to Forum meetings, the parties agree to hold regular communications \nabout the Decree,  compliance issues,  violations, and  other  issues of importance to  Plaintiffs. \nForum  meetings  should  not replace these  regular communications  between the  parties.  The \nForum Facilitator will be copied on all regular and electronic mail between the parties. \nE.  By  December  31,  2009,  Defendants,  after  consultation  with  the  Internal \nVerification Agent, Plaintiffs' counsel and  stakeholders,  shall  establish a standardized process \nfor resolving issues related to individual class members.  This process shall be widely publicized \nand accessible and shall permit individuals or their counsel to raise concerns about problems in \ntheir individual cases without retaliation (or fear of retaliation).  Records shall be kept of the \nissues  raised  and  their  resolutions,  and  summary  reports  shall  be  provided  to  the  Internal \nVerification Agent and Plaintiffs' counsel every six months. \nF.  The  Forum  Facilitator shall  be  selected  by  mutual  agreement of the  parties to \nserve for a term of one calendar year, subject to renewal by mutual agreement of the parties.  If \nthe agreement with the Forum Facilitator is not renewed, the parties shall mutually agree upon a \nnew Forum Facilitator.  If the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty days of the end \nof the agreement, unless extended by  mutual agreement of the parties, they shall mediate the \ndispute with the assistance of the Court. \nG.  The Forum Facilitator shall  be  retained  at Defendants' expense.  All contracts, \nagreements, bills, and payment information related to the Forum Facilitator shall be provided to \nPlaintiffs.  No  party,  nor  any  employee  or  agent  of any  party, shall  have  any  supervisory \nauthority over the Forum Facilitator. \nIV.

Regardless  of whether  Defendants  agree  with  Plaintiffs'  assertion  of non-\ncompliance, the parties shall meet with the Forum Facilitator within fifteen calendar days of the \nDefendants' response, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  The purpose of this meeting \nshall be for the parties to engage  in  good faith  negotiations with the assistance of the Forum \n7 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 8 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 8 of 41 \nFacilitator to determine whether additional actions are necessary to address Plaintiffs' assertion \nof non-compliance.  The parties shall engage in  negotiations for a period not to exceed twenty \ncalendar days, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. \nD.  At the conclusion of the dispute resolution process, if the parties have failed to \ncome to an agreement, either party may request the Forum Facilitator to analyze the issues raised \nby Plaintiffs and the Defendants' response, and prepare and issue a report with recommendations \nconcerning the  dispute.  The  report shall  be  issued  no  later than  ten  days after the  dispute \nresolution process has ended.

Once certified  compliance  with  an  Outcome  has  been  achieved,  the  periodic \nreports required by subsection J of Part One, Section II, \"Verification Activities,\" will no longer \nbe required, nor will verification by the Independent Verification Agent of compliance with the \nOutcome be required.  Instead, the Defendants will continue to  measure compliance with the \nOutcome and will incorporate reporting on the Outcome in quarterly public management reports. \nDefendants shall  notify the Independent Verification  Agent, with a copy to  Plaintiffs,  if their \ncompliance with an Outcome or the methodology for reporting on an Outcome changes. \nC.  If, following Defendants' achievement of certified compliance with an Outcome, \nDefendants' performance falls eight points below the Exit Standards (for example, 82 percent if \nthe metric for the Exit Standard is 90 percent) for two successive six-month reporting periods, \nPlaintiffs may petition the Independent Verification Agent to determine non-compliance.  If the \nIndependent Verification Agent determines that Defendants have failed to maintain compliance \nwith the Outcome, the Defendants shall be deemed to no longer be in certified compliance with \nthat Outcome and shall again be required to report on that Outcome under subsection J of Part \nOne, Section II, \"Verification Activities,\" until the requirements for certified compliance under \nparagraph A of this Section have been met. \nD.  The Defendants shall continue to report on their compliance with the Additional \nCommitments until the Court vacates the Decree. \n8 \n\nCase 1:84-cv-04409-JFM   Document 586   Filed 10/09/09   Page 9 of 41\nCase 1: 84-cv-04409-JFM  Document 556-2  Filed 06/22/2009  Page 9 of 41 \nE.

No. JH-84-4409.\nUnited States District Court, D. Maryland.\nSeptember 27, 1988.\n509 *509 William L. Grimm, Ethel Zelenske, and the Legal Aid Bureau, Inc., Baltimore, Md., Carol R. Golubock, and\nthe Children's Defense Fund, Washington, D.C., Nevett Steele, Jr., Ward B. Coe, III, and Whiteford, Taylor &\nPreston, Baltimore, Md., for plaintiffs.\nJ. Joseph Curran, Jr., Atty. Gen. of Maryland, Catherine M. Schultz and Mark J. Davis, Asst. Attys. Gen.,\nBaltimore, Md., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM\nJOSEPH C. HOWARD, District Judge.\nPending before the court is this civil rights class action brought by foster children in the care and custody of the\nBaltimore City Department of Social Services (\"BCDSS\"). Named as defendants are Ruth Massinga, Secretary of\nMaryland's Department of Human Resources, BCDSS, and various foster-care officials. These children allege\nthat the defendants' administration of the foster care system in Baltimore City violates their rights under federal\nstatutory law, Titles IV-E and IV-B of the Social Security Act, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. The class seeks equitable relief in the form of an affirmative injunction that would require reforms of\nthe foster care system. In addition to these equitable claims, some named class representatives seek monetary\ndamages for harms allegedly suffered while in the defendants' care.\nThe immediate matter under consideration is whether a consent decree proposed by the parties as settlement of\n[1]\nthe equitable claims is fair and adequate and thereby merits the court's approval.  After the proposed decree\nwas submitted on April 26, 1988, the court met with the parties, directed that notice be provided the class\nmembers and interested persons, held a hearing at which those provided notice were invited to present\nobjections or comments, and met with foster care workers to learn their views of the decree. After completion of\nthese measures and careful study of the decree, the court approves the decree for the reasons provided below.\n510  I.\n*510\nThe history of this action is long and arduous. Since the complaint was filed in December, 1984, the court has\nissued over seventy orders and held a dozen status conferences with the parties. The docket, now seventeen\npages long, lists over two hundred entries.\nOn January 2, 1987, the court granted a motion to intervene that had been filed the previous November by two\nadditional proposed class representatives. That same day the court certified a class composed of all children who\nare, have been, or will be placed in foster homes by the BCDSS and are or will be placed in the custody of the\nBCDSS through voluntary placement or court order. On February 6, after conducting extensive discovery,\nincluding a random sampling of BCDSS foster care case records, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction.\nA hearing on the motion was held over a period of two weeks commencing on April 2, 1987. Some 91 separate\nitems of evidence were introduced, and the court heard from 12 witnesses. Among the items of evidence were\n\nthe preliminary results of plaintiffs' random sampling of case records, contained in several thick looseleaf binders.\n[2]\nThe witnesses included an expert on the research methodology used in conducting the plaintiffs' study.  The\ncourt also heard the testimony of relatives and experts regarding the cases of sixteen children who had been\nseverely neglected and abused while in defendants' care and custody.\nThe court found overwhelming evidence of serious systematic deficiencies in Baltimore's foster care program\nsuch that foster children would suffer irreparable harm if immediate injunctive relief were not granted and, in a\n[3]\nMemorandum and Order issued July 27, 1987, granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\nSpecifically, among its findings, the court determined that there was a lack of satisfactory foster homes; that the\ndefendants failed to remove children from homes where physical and emotional abuse and neglect were\nthreatened; that homes were licensed where foster parents were unable to care properly for the children; that\n\"exceptions\" were granted allowing clearly inadequate homes to remain open; that the system for providing\nmedical care to foster children was inadequate to ensure continuous and informed treatment; and that the\ndefendants had substantially failed to undertake the improvements recommended by an internal study produced\nby the \"Harris Task Force.\"\nAs preliminary injunctive relief, the defendants were ordered to (1) review the status of each foster home where\nthere had been a report of maltreatment; (2) visit each child in a BCDSS foster home on a monthly basis; (3) visit\neach child who had been the subject of a report of maltreatment on a weekly basis; (4) assign sufficient staff and\nresources to ensure appropriate medical care was rendered and medical histories were obtained and provided to\nthose rendering medical care to each child; and (5) provide a written copy of any complaint of maltreatment of a\nfoster child to the juvenile court and the child's attorney.\nOn February 1, 1988, the Fourth Circuit affirmed this court's decision to grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. \n511 See L.J. By and Through Darr v. Massinga,*511 838 F.2d 118 (4th Cir.1988).[4] Thereafter, the parties engaged\nin extensive settlement negotiations. On April 26, 1988, approximately two and a half months prior to trial, the\nparties submitted the proposed settlement of plaintiffs' equitable claims now before the court. The consent decree\nthat embodies the settlement retains substantially those measures ordered by the court as preliminary injunctive\nrelief. It also seeks to make substantial improvements in several aspects of the foster care system including\nplacing limits on the number of cases a worker may be responsible for, improving the system for providing\nmedical treatment to foster children, providing assistance to natural parents that would allow children to remain\nwith them thereby avoiding foster care where possible, and providing for a continuum of appropriate foster care\nplacements including the recruitment of new foster homes. Different improvements are to be implemented at\ndifferent times; however, all improvements are to be made within two years.\nAfter preliminary study of the decree and meeting with the parties, the court determined that the decree was\nwithin the range of reasonableness and approved a \"Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action\" on May 19,\n1988.\nII.\nUnder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e), notice of settlement of a class action \"shall be given to all members of the class in such\nmanner as the court directs.\" The court directed that the approved notice of settlement, which contained a\ndetailed summary of the proposed decree, be sent to all foster parents, all relatives with whom children had been\nplaced by BCDSS, and all biological parents of children who had been placed in foster homes or with relatives on\nor before June 8, 1988. The Court also ordered that the notice be posted at any BCDSS office frequented by\nfoster parents or by the natural parents of foster children. The full notice of settlement also was mailed to the\n[5]\nheads of organizations known to represent foster children or known to have an interest in foster care issues.\nIn addition to the mailing and posting of the full notice, a court-approved abbreviated notice was published five\n[6]\ntimes in four daily newspapers.\n\nThe notices informed interested parties that they could object to the decree at a hearing held on July 18, 1988.\nThose interested in testifying at the hearing were told to submit written statements to the court by July 8;\nhowever, at the hearing all were invited to testify regardless of whether that requirement had been met.\nAt the hearing, a total of ten people testified. These included foster parents, natural parents, a spokesman for a\nunion which represents some foster care workers, a former foster child, and the husband of a foster care worker.\nNone of those who testified objected to the decree. The foster parents expressed concern about the system for\nproviding medical services to foster children. The former foster child told the court that she had been abused and\nmolested while she was in the defendants' care, and she asked the court to implement the decree as soon as\npossible. The union representative expressed concern with some provisions and omissions of the decree;\nhowever, he said that the union's foster care worker members generally supported the decree.\nBoth the union representative and the foster care worker's husband urged the court to meet privately with the\n512 foster care *512 workers, who did not wish to express any criticisms publicly. So that the court could hear the\nviews of the people who would implement the decree on a day-to-day basis, an off the record meeting with foster\ncare workers was held on August 3, 1988, with counsel present.\nDuring that meeting, the workers expressed several concerns. In particular, the foster care workers stated that\nthey often travel hundreds of miles per month and asked that transportation aides be employed by BCDSS to\nassist them. They also said that a pool of temporary foster care workers should be available to assist when a\nworker is ill or on vacation. The foster care workers also asked that they be assured a role in the implementation\nand monitoring of the decree.\nIII.\nThe court's approval of a proposed settlement is required in order to protect the interest of absent class\nmembers. Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1327 (5th Cir.),cert. denied,449 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66\nL.Ed.2d 469 (1980); Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 513 F.2d 114, 123 (8th Cir.),cert. denied,423\nU.S. 864, 96 S.Ct. 124, 46 L.Ed.2d 93 (1975). Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit has admonished that the district\ncourt is not \"to give the settlement `mere boilerplate approval'\" that is \"`unsupported by evaluation of the facts or\nanalysis of the law.'\" Flinn v. FMC Corporation, 528 F.2d 1169, 1173 (4th Cir.1975),cert. denied,424 U.S. 967,\n96 S.Ct. 1462, 47 L.Ed.2d 734 (1976) (quoting, Protective Committee For Independent Stockholders of TMT\nFerry, Inc. v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 434, 88 S.Ct. 1157, 1168, 20 L.Ed.2d 1,reh. denied,391 U.S. 909, 88\nS.Ct. 1649, 20 L.Ed.2d 425 (1968)). The court \"must independently and objectively analyze the evidence and\ncircumstances before it in order to determine whether the settlement is in the best interest of those whose claims\nwill be extinguished.\" 2 H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, § 11.40 at 451 (2nd ed. 1985).\nApproval will be given only where a proposed settlement is determined to be \"fair, reasonable and adequate.\" In\nre Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, 605 F.Supp. 440, 442 (D.Md.1984) (quoting, Manual on Complex\nLitigation, § 1.46 at 56-57 (5th ed. 1982)); Washington v. Keller, 479 F.Supp. 569, 572 (D.Md. 1979). In making\nthat determination, this court has followed the bifurcated analysis set forth by Judge C. Stanley Blair in In re\nMontgomery County Real Estate Antitrust Litigation, 83 F.R.D. 305, 315-317 (D.Md.1979). See also, In re Mid-\nAtlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, supra, 605 F.Supp. at 442-43. \"That analysis includes separate inquiries on\nthe `fairness' and the `adequacy' of the proposed settlement.\" Id. at 443. Regarding fairness, Judge Blair stated:\nThe factors tending to reveal the `fairness' of a settlement are those which indicate the presence\nor absence of collusion among the parties. Because of the danger of counsel's compromising a\nsuit for an inadequate amount for the sake of insuring a fee, the court is obliged to ascertain that\nthe settlement was reached as a result of good-faith bargaining at arm's length. The good faith of\nthe parties is reflected in such factors as the posture of the case at the time settlement is\nproposed, the extent of discovery that has been conducted, the circumstances surrounding the\nnegotiations and the experience of counsel. (citations omitted).\n\nIn re Montgomery County Real Estate Antitrust Litigation, supra, 83 F.R.D. at 315. When inquiring into adequacy,\n\"the court must weigh the likelihood of the plaintiffs' recovery on the merits against the amount offered in\nsettlement.\" Id. at 315-316. Specifically, Judge Blair noted that:\n[C]ourts should weigh the amount tendered to the plaintiffs against such factors as (1) the relative\nstrength of the plaintiffs' case on the merits; (2) the existence of any difficulties of proof or strong\ndefenses the plaintiffs are likely to encounter if the case goes to trial; (3) the anticipated duration\n513 and expense of *513 additional litigation; (4) the solvency of the defendants and the likelihood of\nrecovering on a litigated judgment; and (5) the degree of opposition to the settlement. (citations\nomitted).\nId. at 316. In Flinn v. FMC Corporation, supra, the Fourth Circuit further noted that \"[t]he fact that all discovery\nhas been completed and the cause is ready for trial is important, since it ordinarily assures sufficient development\nof the facts to permit a reasonable judgment on the possible merits of the case.\" (footnote omitted). 528 F.2d at\n1173.\nIV.\nThis case represents perhaps the most hotly and thoroughly contested litigation the undersigned has\nexperienced in twenty years as a judge. Exhaustive discovery efforts were undertaken by both sides. As\ndescribed earlier, the court has entered over seventy orders in this case and there are over two hundred entries\non the docket.\nThe court concludes that the settlement reached in this action was the result of good faith bargaining at arms'\nlength. Serious settlement negotiations commenced only after plaintiffs had completed a substantial random\nsampling of defendants' case files as the major item of their discovery; after the court had granted a preliminary\ninjunction following an evidentiary hearing that lasted twelve days; and after the Fourth Circuit had affirmed the\ninjunction. See, L.J. by and through Darr v. Massinga, supra, 838 F.2d at 122. Discovery as to plaintiffs' equitable\nclaims is now complete.\nSettlement negotiations took place over a period of six weeks and included several half-day and full-day\nsessions. During these negotiations and throughout this litigation, plaintiffs have been represented by a\ndedicated, highly skilled, and very experienced team of attorneys. Two members of this team, including William L.\nGrimm, Esquire, who served as lead counsel, came from the Baltimore office of the Legal Aid Bureau, which\nrepresents the great majority of Baltimore's foster children in the juvenile courts. Carol R. Golubock, Esquire, of\nthe Children's Defense Fund, has extensive experience in class litigation concerning child welfare law in federal\ncourts. In addition, Nevett Steele, Jr., Esquire, and Ward B. Coe, III, Esquire, partners in the firm of Whiteford,\nTaylor and Preston, participated in representing the plaintiffs. Both have excellent qualifications and extensive\nexperience in federal litigation, including class action litigation, before this court.\nFinally, the question of attorneys' fees was addressed separately from the negotiations concerning the terms of\nthe decree. The discussion of fees was undertaken by a different group of lawyers and concluded well after the\nsubmission of the proposed consent decree. Under these circumstances, the court concludes that the settlement\nwas reached in an appropriate manner and is the product of arms'-length bargaining.\nV.\nHad this action gone to trial, it is very likely that the plaintiffs would have succeeded. For the reasons stated in its\nMemorandum and Order of July 27, 1987, this court already has determined that success by the plaintiffs would\nbe the likely outcome of a trial on the merits. No viable defenses to plaintiffs' claims for equitable relief are\napparent. In deciding whether the proposed consent decree is adequate, the court must weigh this likelihood of\nplaintiffs' success on the merits against the quality of the relief afforded by the decree. In re Montgomery County\nReal Estate Antitrust Litigation, supra, 83 F.R.D. at 316. Any settlement of this action must afford the plaintiffs\nrelief that is at least comparable to what they could have received following trial on the merits.\n\nThe court's ability to make an independent assessment of the adequacy of the settlement in this case rests on\nsubstantial knowledge of the problems facing Baltimore's foster care system. This knowledge was acquired\nthrough study of the pleadings, meetings with the parties, conducting the settlement hearing, meeting with case\n514 workers, and, primarily, through *514 the twelve-day-long preliminary injunction hearing at which hundreds of\npages of documents were entered into evidence.\nEvidence presented during the preliminary injunction hearing revealed that many current foster homes are\ninadequate, and that there is a severe shortage of foster parents. As a result of the shortage of foster homes,\ndefendants have been willing to grant exceptions allowing homes that should have been closed to remain open;\nhave allowed some people to become or remain foster parents who should not have been; and have appeared\nreluctant to remove children from homes even when there should have been concern for their safety. Accordingly,\nhad judgment on the merits been rendered and the court been charged with fashioning appropriate relief, it would\nhave insisted that a diligent effort be made to recruit new homes. Specific numbers of new foster homes might\nhave been ordered opened by specific dates.\nParagraph 11 of the proposed consent decree addresses recruitment of new foster homes. It does not state\nspecifically what efforts will be made nor estimate how many homes will be opened. Paragraph 11 provides:\nDefendants shall maintain a foster home recruitment unit in Baltimore City Department of Social\nServices. The unit shall develop and implement a sustained recruitment plan, and shall issue\nperiodic reports on the status of its recruitment efforts.\nThe court's concern regarding paragraph 11 were heightened by published news accounts of the decree in which\ndefendant Ruth Massinga, Secretary of the Department of Human Resources, was quoted as suggesting that,\nunder the terms of the decree, children could be left in the homes of their natural parents if space in the foster\ncare system was not available.\nNaturally, the criteria for deciding when a child is to be removed from the home should focus on the well-being of\nthe child. If the safety of the child requires that a child be removed from the natural parents, space must be\navailable in foster care. Any settlement that provides otherwise is simply inadequate to protect these children and\nunworthy of the court's approval.\nRead in its entirety the proposed decree does appear to provide that foster care placements will be made\navailable for all children who need them. Indeed, paragraph 9 provides in part, that \"defendants shall establish\nand maintain a continuum of foster care placements reasonably calculated to ensure that there are appropriate\nfoster care placements for all children who come into foster care.\"\nDuring two conferences and in a lengthy letter, the court sought clarification and interpretation of the decree from\nthe parties as to these issues. Defendants responded in their memorandum in support of the decree submitted on\nJuly 11, 1988 and at the settlement hearing held on July 18, 1988. In their memorandum and at the hearing,\ndefendants stressed that the decree represents a balance between efforts toward family preservation (aimed at\nkeeping children with their natural parents where possible) and efforts to provide additional foster care\nplacements. Specifically, defendants' memorandum declares that:\n... [F]ederal law mandates equivalent efforts in family preservation and foster care initiatives and\ndefendants believe that these programs complement each other.\nThus, the decree contains provisions with respect to each of these complementary programs.\nFoster home recruitment and services will be enhanced significantly under the decree.\nSpecifically, recruitment efforts have been and continue to be extensive. Similarly, significant\nfunding has been obtained to provide intensive family services to prevent children from coming\ninto foster care. Reunification services are also recognized under the decree.\nIn sum, the Consent Decree adequately addresses the need to provide for foster care placements\nalong a continuum of appropriate placements, including the recruitment of regular foster homes,\n\nand simultaneously addresses the need to keep, where appropriate, children from entering the\nfoster care system....\n515 *515 Defendants' Memorandum in Support of defendants' Motion for Approval of the Consent Decree, pages 9\nand 10 (citations omitted). See also transcripts of settlement hearing held July 18, 1988, page 88. Defendants'\nmemorandum relies on the accompanying affidavits of Philip C. Holmes, Director of the Office of Child Welfare\nServices of the Social Services Administration of the Maryland Department of Human Resources, and Regina M.\nBernard, Director of the Office of Family and Child Development of the Social Services Administration of the\nMaryland Department of Human Resources. Mr. Holmes avers that the Department of Human Resources \"will\ncontinue to intensify efforts to recruit foster parents,\" and that the Department of Human Resources and the\nBaltimore City Department of Social Services \"both have aggressive campaigns to solicit applications from new\nfamilies.\" Efforts to recruit new foster homes include increases in the board rates paid to foster parents and an\n[7]\naggressive public relations campaign.\nWith these clarifications in mind, it is the opinion of the court that, if properly implemented, the consent decree will\nresult in substantial and needed improvements in Baltimore's foster care system, and is adequate to protect the\n[8]\ninterests of these plaintiffs.  Indeed, the decree appears to represent an innovative approach aimed at keeping\nchildren with their parents, where possible, coupled with efforts to provide additional and varied placement where\nplacement in foster care is required. Under the \"Intensive Family Services\" program provided for by the decree a\nsocial worker is made available during a period of ninety days for as many hours as necessary to alleviate a\nfamily crisis threatening removal of a child from the parents' home. See Affidavit of Regina M. Bernard; Consent\nDecree, par. 15. During this period, a variety of services are made available to the parents that will help them to\nbetter care for the child. Consent Decree, par. 15. A similar program is also to be initiated to facilitate quick\n516 reunification in some cases where the child is removed *516 from the home. Id. par. 17. Among the variety of\nplacements that will be provided, in addition to the recruitment of new regular foster homes, are emergency\nshelter care placements and specialized foster care placements for children with specialized needs. Id. par. 9.\nIn its order of July 27, 1987 granting preliminary injunctive relief, the court included various remedial measures\nintended to provide increased protection to foster children until a full hearing on the merits could be held. The\ncourt's confidence in the settlement is strengthened by the inclusion of several of these measures as part of the\ndecree. These include requirements that each foster home be visited once a month; that, if an abuse or neglect\ncomplaint is received regarding a home, visits be made once a week, id., par. 22-24; copies of the abuse or\nneglect report be provided to the child's attorney, id., par. 30; and that some major improvements be made in the\nsystem for providing health care to foster children. Id., par. 21A-F.\nMost important in assessing the adequacy of the settlement proposed in this action is the great degree to which\nthe decree provides plaintiffs with substantially all the equitable relief they requested from the court in their\ncomplaint. The relief provided under the terms of the decree is comprehensive in scope and includes provisions\nthat strengthen requirements for education of foster children, id., par. 19; require certain information about foster\nchildren to be provided to their foster parents, id., par. 14; increases foster care stipends, id., par. 10; and\nprovides for training of foster parents and foster care workers, id., par. 6, 7, and 13. Importantly, the decree\nrequires substantial decreases in the work load of foster care workers by providing low maximum case loads for\nworkers, id., par. 5.\nThe preliminary injunction hearing revealed serious deficiencies in the system for providing health care to foster\nchildren. Specifically, the court found that incomplete medical histories were provided to medical care\nprofessionals and that treatment rendered to foster children was episodic rather than continuous. Accordingly, as\npreliminary injunctive relief, the court required defendants to assign sufficient staff and resources to ensure that\nproper medical histories are obtained and that appropriate medical care is provided foster children. The decree\namplifies and expands on the court's preliminary injunctive relief, id., par. 21. It requires that an initial health care\nscreening take place within twenty-four hours of the child's placement in foster care; that a comprehensive health\nassessment be completed within sixty days of placement; and that complete medical histories containing specific\ninformation be obtained and provided to physicians. Defendants are responsible for ensuring that treatment for\nany diagnosed problems is promptly provided.\n\nFoster children placed in the homes of relatives are not expressly mentioned in the plaintiffs' prayers for relief. At\nthe time plaintiffs' amended complaint was filed with the court, plaintiffs' counsel were unaware that this group of\nfoster children was treated far differently from other foster children. Indeed, at the time of the preliminary\ninjunction hearing, it appeared that foster children placed with relatives were not considered nor included as part\nof the foster care system. Children placed with relatives were not counted in the foster care system inventory and\ntheir caretakers did not receive foster care benefits.\n[9]\nAccording to defendants, approximately 1,100 children are placed with their relatives.  At this time, most of the\nprovisions of the decree will not be applied to them; instead a study by an impartial consultant will be undertaken\nin which the status of each child placed with a relative will be assessed. Id., Par. 27A. The plaintiffs may request\nadditional relief for these children when the impartial assessment is completed. Id., par. 28. The decree, however,\ndoes provide for the immediate implementation of certain basic protections for children placed with relatives,\n517 including the development of case plans; six and eighteen-month *517 reviews by persons outside the BCDSS,\nand bimonthly home visits to ensure compliance with health and safety standards. Id., Par. 25-28. In addition,\nrelatives providing care to foster children will be encouraged to apply for licensure as foster parents. Id., Par.\n25D. Care being provided to these children also will be evaluated by means of contacts with their teachers and\nmedical case providers. Id., Par. 27B.\nAlthough the court required a thorough notice to the class, there were no outright objections lodged against the\ndecree. Both the Foster Care Review Board and foster care workers, however, did express some reservations. In\n[10]\na letter to the court dated July 14, 1988, the chairperson of the State Foster Care Review Board  expressed\nparticular concern about the lack of foster homes. Joan L. Graham wrote that the lack of homes \"keeps the\nplacement of children at a crisis level, results in inappropriate, short term placements and multiple placements for\nsome children.\" As noted earlier, the court shares the Board's concern that more be done to recruit adequate\nfoster homes. In deciding that the decree adequately protects this class of children, the court relies on\n[11]\ndefendants' assurances and interpretation of the decree as requiring vigorous efforts to recruit new homes.\nAt the settlement hearing addressing the adequacy of the consent decree and later during a conference with the\ncourt, foster care workers expressed strong reservations about whether the terms of the decree could be\nimplemented from a practical standpoint. They emphasized that they will be charged with the responsibility of\nimplementing the decree on a day-to-day basis, and, without the benefit of additional resources, they doubted\nthey could carry out the decree's terms. Specifically, the foster care workers noted that they are often required to\ntravel hundreds of miles in a month in order to meet their obligations. They also must take on additional\nobligations when a co-worker is sick or on vacation. It is the apparent consensus among foster care workers that\nthey will be unable to make the additional visits to foster homes and foster children required by the decree\nwithout additional resources. Accordingly, the workers asked the court to amend the decree to require their\nsuperiors to provide transportation aides and a pool of temporary substitute workers. The transportation aides\ncould assist workers in meeting requirements to visit foster homes and also assist in transporting children and\nfoster parents to medical and other appointments. A pool of temporary or substitute case workers could take over\ncases assigned to workers who are unable to be at work without the necessity of over-burdening other regular\nworkers.\nNoting that the suggestions of the foster care workers had substantial practical merits, the court wrote the parties\nand asked if transportation aides and a pool of temporary workers might be agreed upon as a means of properly\nimplementing the decree. In response, both parties informed the court that these measures had been a subject of\nthe negotiations that produced the decree. It was determined in those negotiations, however, that the specific\nmeasures adopted in order to achieve the requirements of the decree were to be left to the judgment of the\ndefendants, at least at this early stage.\nFurthermore, during the meeting with foster care workers, counsel for the plaintiffs emphasized that, if the\n518 requirements *518 of the decree could not be met by case workers, the defendants would be required to reduce\nthe case load ratios of children to foster care workers below the maximum ratios allowed by the decree. In this\nway, the work load would be lessened to allow the foster care workers to better meet their obligations under the\ndecree.\n\nThe foster care workers also asked that they be allowed to participate in the implementation and monitoring of\nthe decree. Specifically, they requested to receive the reports required every six months from the BCDSS and the\nDepartment of Human Resources that set forth the steps taken to achieve compliance with the decree, and\nrequested that they be given an opportunity to be heard. During its August 3rd meeting with foster care workers,\nthe court was impressed by their commitment to foster children and their strong desire that the foster care system\nbe improved. Moreover, since these workers will implement the decree on a day-to-day basis, their views may be\nworth hearing in the future. Accordingly, as part of its enforcement powers, the court will order that defendants\ndeliver the six month reports to the foster care workers. Should they wish to be heard after receiving a report, the\ncourt would seriously consider such a request at that time.\nVI\nFor the reasons stated above, the court finds that the consent decree submitted by the parties on April 26, 1988\nis fair, reasonable, adequate and deserving of approval.\nThe court closes with a personal note and word of caution. I have now been a judge for twenty years. During this\ntime much human tragedy has passed before me; however, none has so deeply touched me as the plight of\nthese children. I believe that vigorous enforcement of this decree is essential, and I will do all within my power to\nsee that its provisions are fully implemented.\nADDENDUM A: CONSENT DECREE\nCONSENT DECREE\nThis Decree is made and entered into by and between all of the named plaintiffs, L.J., O.S., M.S., C.S., P.G.,\nR.K., and S.J., and the certified class of persons whom plaintiffs represent as set forth in the January 16, 1987\nOrder of this Court (hereafter described in Attachment A and collectively referred to as \"plaintiffs\") and all\ndefendants.\nWHEREAS, on or about December 5, 1984, plaintiffs commenced an action in the United States District Court for\nthe District of Maryland (hereinafter \"the Court\" or \"this Court\") and thereafter filed a first amended complaint, and\nplaintiffs R.K. and S.J. filed a motion to intervene, which was granted herein on or about January 21, 1987;\nWHEREAS, plaintiffs' complaint, amended complaint, and complaint in intervention make certain allegations and\nseek certain relief with respect to the foster family care program administered by the State of Maryland,\nparticularly as that program is administered by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services;\nWHEREAS, defendants deny all of the allegations of the complaint, amended complaint, and complaint in\nintervention, particularly all legal contentions that any defendant has ever violated any State or federal law in the\nconduct of the family foster care program;\nWHEREAS, plaintiffs allege that children who are committed by the juvenile court to the defendants' care and\ncustody and who are placed with their relatives are entitled to the same protections as children placed with non-\nrelatives, and defendants dispute that the same protections apply to these children;\nWHEREAS, defendants have taken and continue to take substantial positive actions to improve the quality of\ncare and services provided to foster care children; and\nWHEREAS, in an effort to avoid further litigation, plaintiffs and defendants believe that settlement of this matter\nand entry of this Consent Decree is in the public interest, without any admission of liability by any defendant for\n519 any purpose, to settle *519 and resolve all claims for declaratory relief and equitable relief, including injunctive\nrelief, raised in the complaint, amended complaint, and complaint in intervention, and all matters addressed in\nthis Decree.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\nJURISDICTION\n1.

The responsibilities of this unit do\nnot include direct case responsibility or the providing of direct services.\nFOSTER PLACEMENT RESOURCES\n9. Within two years of the entry of this Decree and to the extent within their control, defendants shall establish\nand maintain a continuum of foster care placements reasonably calculated to ensure that there are appropriate\nfoster care placements for all children who come into care. The continuum shall include regular foster homes,\nspecialized homes, emergency shelter homes, emergency shelters, group homes and therapeutic foster homes\nas defined in COMAR. (Therapeutic foster homes are homes in which foster parents receive a salary and other\nservices in addition to the foster care board rate.) In addition, defendants shall seek annually sufficient funds\nthrough their budget requests or elsewhere (i) to purchase special services for children in foster care needed to\nprevent their institutionalization, and (ii) to assure stipends to emergency shelter care homes even in months in\nwhich no children are being cared for.\n10. Defendants shall continue their past practice of seeking through the budget process increases in the rate of\nreimbursement paid to foster families by including such increases in their budget requests and advocating for\ntheir appropriation with the goal of reaching by State Fiscal Year 1991 a rate of no less than the amount\ndetermined by the United States Department of Agriculture as necessary to care adequately for children in urban\nareas of the southern region of the country.\n11. Defendants shall maintain a foster home recruitment unit in DSS. The unit shall develop and implement a\nsustained recruitment plan, and shall issue periodic reports on the status of its recruitment efforts.\n12. Within one year of entry of this Decree, defendants shall require as a condition of licensure that all new foster\nparents complete a course of pre-service training of at least 12 hours.

Before a child is placed in a foster home, DSS shall provide the foster parents necessary information about\nthe child including the reason for the child's coming into care initially and, if applicable, the reason for the current\nplacement; medical, psychological or behavioral problems that the child may have of which the agency has\nknowledge and any on-going treatment the child is receiving for any such problems of which the agency has\nknowledge. In addition, DSS shall make reasonable efforts to provide foster parents with the child's recent grade\nand attendance record in school. If an emergency placement is necessary, defendants shall provide the\ninformation to the foster parent within ten working days of placement.\nPERMANENCY AND INTENSIVE FAMILY SERVICES\n15. A. Except in emergency situations where a child faces a substantial risk of harm and where services cannot\nprevent the removal of the child, reasonable efforts will be made by the appropriate DSS personnel prior to\nplacement of a child in foster care to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his or her home.\nSuch reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for placement or to reunify a child who has been placed\nshall include, where appropriate in the worker's professional judgment, the provision or securing of family\ncounseling services, drugs and alcohol abuse services, day care, parenting education services and assistance\nprovided under the federal Emergency Assistance to Families with Children program to the extent allowed by law.\nServices and assistance shall be provided in a duration and intensity reasonably assured of meeting their goal.\nB.

A case plan for each child in foster care shall set forth the services and assistance that have been provided to\nprevent or eliminate the need for removal from the home and the reasons those efforts did not succeed.\n16. In all cases in which the goal is to return a foster child to his or her biological home, defendants shall make\nreasonable efforts to facilitate weekly visits between the parent and child, unless the juvenile court orders\notherwise, or DSS finds that such visits are not in the child's best interest. Before permanent reunification,\novernight and weekend visits should be provided if appropriate.\n17. A. In each case in which the case plan is the child's return home, DSS shall enter into a service agreement\nwith the biological parent of the child within 60 days of the child's placement unless the parent is unavailable or\nunwilling to agree. The agreement shall set forth the current barriers to the child's return home, the steps the\nparent must take in order to have the child returned to him or her, the timelines for completion of these steps, the\nservices, if any, the caseworker and DSS will provide to the parent (for example, referral to alcohol abuse\ncounseling) and the timelines within which any services will be provided.\nB. Defendants shall continue to follow the guidelines for workers on when a permanency plan shall be changed\n522 from return home. Such guidelines require that the *522 case plan goal be changed promptly when the parent\nfails continuously to fulfill terms agreed to in the service agreement and/or when the parent has not maintained\nregular visitation or other contact with the child.\n\n18. A petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed on behalf of each child for whom the goal is adoption\nwithin 120 days of the DSS establishing such a goal.\nEDUCATION\n19. A. Within five working days of being placed in nonemergent foster care, a child of school age shall be\nattending school (if school is in session), unless school attendance within five working days is unattainable for\nreasons outside the control of DSS. In such cases, DSS will make all reasonable efforts to obtain school\nattendance as soon as practicable.\nB.

Within two years of the entry of the Decree, all caseworkers shall receive training with respect to the special\neducation screening, evaluation, assessment and individualized education plan process. Thereafter, the worker\nshall notify the child's attorney if these services are not provided in a timely fashion.\nD. If DSS holds guardianship with the right to consent to adoption or long-term care short of adoption of a child\nand that child is educationally handicapped or is suspected of being educationally handicapped, the child's\ncaseworker shall provide the local education agency with appropriate documentation of the child's legal status so\nthat the school can apply for the appointment of a parent surrogate.\nEXPLANATION OF RIGHTS\n20. Within six months of entry of this Decree, defendants shall prepare a handbook describing the rights and\nresponsibilities of foster children, biological parents and foster parents. Defendants shall provide a draft of the\nhandbook to plaintiffs' counsel.

All foster children shall be referred for a comprehensive health assessment within 30 days of entering\nplacement. The assessment shall be completed within 60 days of entering placement. This assessment shall\n\naddress the child's medical, emotional and developmental needs. The results of this assessment will be made\n523 available to the child's health care provider(s). *523 The provider(s) selected by DSS to provide health care for\nthe child shall be reasonably calculated to meet the child's specific needs identified by the assessment.\nD. All foster children shall have periodic medical, dental and developmental examinations in accordance with the\nschedules or protocols of the EPSDT. If needs are identified at the periodic examinations that were not identified\npreviously, the provider(s) selected by DSS shall be reasonably calculated to meet these additional needs.\nE. For each child in foster care the defendants shall develop and use an abbreviated health care record (e.g.,\nmedical passport), which shall accompany the child through the out-of-home care system and upon his or her\nreturn home, adoption or emancipation. An abbreviated health care record shall require the following information:\nthe medical facilities where the child usually receives care, the child's condition at placement as documented by\nhis or her physician, and the child's immunization record, allergies/adverse reactions, chronic health problems\nand present medications. The foster parents of the child shall be provided with the health passport completed to\nthe extent possible at the time of a child's replacement or if an initial placement within 5 days of placement.\nCopies of the forms contained in the passport shall be included in the child's case record and shall be reviewed\nby a supervisor at least every 6 months.\nF. Within two years of entry of this Decree, defendants shall establish and maintain a health services\nmanagement unit within DSS.

Each child in a foster family home shall be visited by their assigned caseworker or his or her substitute at\nleast once every month. The purpose of the visit is to assess the quality of care being provided to the child and\nthe child's adjustment to the foster home, foster parents, other persons present in the home, and school. The\ninterview shall be of sufficient duration and privacy to evaluate the child's adjustment to placement in the foster\nhome. The caseworker shall indicate the date and summarize the results of each visit in the child's case record.\nWhere indicated, the case-worker, based on his or her professional judgment, shall visit or contact the child more\nfrequently. During the first three months a child is placed or replaced, the caseworker shall visit or contact the\nchild more frequently when in his or her professional judgment such is appropriate.\n23. If an abuse or neglect complaint is filed pertaining to a foster family home, the assigned caseworker(s) shall\nvisit the home at least once a week until the complaint is ruled out.\n24. If an abuse or neglect complaint is not ruled out, the caseworkers shall visit the home at least once a week\nuntil the children are removed from the home or until the juvenile court orders otherwise or the child's attorney\nand DSS agree otherwise.\nPLACEMENT WITH RELATIVES\n25. A. A child committed by the juvenile court to DSS may be placed with his or her relative(s).\nB. Such a child shall be provided a case plan and 6-month administrative and 18-month juvenile court reviews of\nhis or her placement.

If the DSS employee or agent conducting the inventory observes evidence of any threat to the\nchild's health or safety, the DSS employee or agent, if other than the child's worker, shall report that evidence to\nthe child's worker. The results of the inventory shall be made available to plaintiffs' attorneys upon the issuance of\na protective order.\nB. In addition, defendants will seek the necessary statutory authority to conduct criminal background\ninvestigations for relative caretakers and others known to be in the household. After such approval is obtained,\nDSS shall conduct such investigations for existing and prospective caretakers and others known to be in the\nhousehold.\nC. Within six months of the entry of this Decree, DSS shall determine if a home meets basic health and sanitary\nstandards within 30 days of placement.\n27. A. Within one year of the entry of this Decree, an assessment shall be made of the health and educational\nstatus of each child placed with a relative.

The selection of the consultant shall be made by an evaluation\ncommittee or review panel. One member of the committee or panel shall be mutually acceptable to the parties.\nB. The consultant shall oversee the gathering of data for the assessment. The assessment shall include contacts\nwith the child's education provider and medical provider. The consultant shall determine generally the child's\neducational and medical status and the existence, if any, of unmet needs of the child. The child's caseworker\nshall make reasonable efforts to facilitate the child's obtaining educational and medical services sufficient to\naddress the identified unmet needs. A report of the assessment result in regard to each child shall be made\navailable on a quarterly basis to plaintiffs' attorneys upon the issuance of a protective order.\n28. Within 30 days of receipt of the final consultant's report, plaintiffs may file objections pursuant to ¶ 35 of this\nDecree, including a statement of why children placed with relatives are entitled to additional protections.\nREPORTS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT\n29. Whenever a DSS employee has reason to suspect that the abuse or neglect of a child in foster care or a child\nplaced with a relative has occurred, the DSS employee shall notify the protective service unit of DSS.

Ethel\nZelenske, Esq. \nADDENDUM B: MEMORANDUM AND ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY\nINJUNCTION DATED JULY 27, 1987\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n529 This is a class action by foster care children who allege that defendants' administration *529 of the foster care\nsystem in the City of Baltimore violates plaintiffs' rights under federal statutory law, Titles IV-E and IV-B of the\nSocial Security Act, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The class representatives\nalso seek monetary damages for the harms allegedly suffered while in the care and custody of the defendants.\nPending before the Court are plaintiffs' motions for (1) a preliminary injunction (2) sanctions based upon\ndefendants' failure to respond factually to plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and (3) a default judgment. A\nhearing on the motions was held from April 2 to April 15, 1987, the parties submitted post-hearing briefs by May\n22, 1987. Some 91 separate items of evidence were introduced and the Court heard from 12 witnesses. Among\nthe items of evidence were seven looseleaf binders including scores of documents. For the reasons which follow,\nthe motions will be granted.\nI.\nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nIn their motion for a preliminary injunction and accompanying memorandum plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that,\nbefore and after the filing of this action in December 1984, \"some [foster] children continue to receive brutal\ntreatment in foster homes in which they are placed by the defendants,\" and \"substantial numbers of children do\nnot receive basic medical care and treatment for disease and disabilities.\" Plaintiffs contend that the continued\nacts and omissions by the defendants violate plaintiffs' rights under the Constitution and federal foster care law.\nThis Court is asked to order the defendants to administer the Baltimore foster care system in compliance with\n\nfederal statutory and constitutional law by enjoining plaintiffs from allowing inadequate homes to remain in the\nfoster care system; failing to provide proper medical care; and by requiring prompt reporting of complaints of\nabuse and neglect to the appropriate authorities.\nIn defendants' response to plaintiffs' motion, defendants contend that they have acted vigorously to make\nsubstantial improvements in the Baltimore foster care; that plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that defendants acted\nwith deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' rights; and that plaintiffs' proof reveals, at most, isolated incidents of past\nexposure to harm. Defendants support their opposition with thirteen documents purporting to demonstrate\nimprovements they have made or are attempting to make in the foster care program.\nThe contentions advanced by plaintiffs concerning irreparable harm to foster children can be grouped into four\ncategories:\n(a) instances of neglect and abuse revealed through random case sampling;\n(b) inadequate medical care;\n(c) absence of protection afforded Code 517 children; and\n(d) failure to undertake adequate and effective measures to address deficiencies in the system in\nthe Baltimore City Foster Care Program revealed by the Harris Task Force in September 1984.\nThe Court will discuss plaintiffs' motion within the above categories.\n(A)\nInstances of Neglect and Abuse Revealed Through Random Case\nSampling\nPlaintiffs base their allegations of widespread, systematic omissions and failures by defendants, in part, on a\nstudy undertaken at their request by Dr. Trudy Festinger. Dr. Festinger chairs the Department of Research of the\nSchool of Social Work at New York University and has studied how caseworkers assess adoptive applicants,\nfoster care agreements between departments of social services and foster parents nationally, and the\neffectiveness of court supervision of children in foster care. Dr. Festinger has published ten studies and lectured\nabout foster care issues and research methodology. She serves on the New York State Board of Social Welfare.\n530 *530 Plaintiffs' study was accomplished through the review of individual foster care case records maintained by\nthe defendants. Dr. Festinger reviewed files and the foster care policies of the Baltimore City Department of\nSocial Services (BCDSS) to formulate the study. She also selected and trained casereaders and on-site\nsupervisors and monitored the case reading.\nThe case reading focused on children who had been placed in foster care from January 1, 1983 to April 30, 1986.\nTwo criteria determined which files were read: (1) the child could not have been placed in care out-of-state nor in\na purchase care facility during the relevant time period; and (2) a child had to have been placed in a foster home\nfor at least 60 days.\nThe four thousand (4,000) children represented by the Legal Aid Bureau in Child in Need of Assistance (CINA)\nproceedings were the universe from which the files to be read were selected.\nEight hundred and ninety seven (897) names were randomly selected from the universe. Through information\nfrom the Baltimore City Juvenile Circuit Court, the Attorney General, the Baltimore City Foster Care Review\nBoard, BCDSS and the Legal Aid Bureau, each randomly drawn name was checked against the study criteria,\napproximately one-quarter met the criteria.\nPlaintiffs' casereaders read 149 of the 224 cases that met the sampling criteria (¼ of 897). Dr. Festinger\nconcluded that her opinion could reasonably be based on that number.\n\nCasereaders extracted only information found in the child's record. They recorded any documented concern,\nsuspicion, or complaint of child maltreatment, casereader judgments were not recorded. The readers used a 69\npage questionnaire containing 77 questions to be answered for each case. The casereading instruments\nprovided uniform summaries of the readers' observations.\nCriticisms of Plaintiffs' Study\nDefendants' witness Roger White, Ph.D., Associate Professor at John Hopkins School of Public Health in the\nDepartment of Maternal and Child Health, was qualified as an expert in statistics and the use of random sampling\ntechniques in social sciences and child welfare studies. Dr. White's criticism of the plaintiffs' sampling\nmethodology, included: (1) uncertainty as to the sampling frame; (2) the lack of an explanation why only 149 of\nthe 230 \"total end sample\" were the basis for Dr. Festinger's conclusions; (3) the lack of operational definitions for\nsuch terms as \"emotional abuse\" and \"sexual abuse\"; (4) alleged inaccuracies in computation of random sample\n(i.e., the sample should have been about 500 names not 230); and (5) concern about the reliability of the\ncompleted case reading instruments. After considering these criticisms, the Court finds that the plaintiffs' study is\nsufficiently sound for the purposes of this motion.\nThe sampling frame was foster children represented by the Legal Aid Bureau in CINA proceedings. The 149\ncases used as a basis for Dr. Festinger's opinions had been analyzed in time to be utilized at the hearing. There\nis no evidence of significant statistical bias in the sample. Approximately 220 cases were to be examined\nbecause that is the number of cases that met the sample criteria.\nWith respect to \"operational definitions\", plaintiffs' casereaders merely recorded expressions of concern found in\ndefendants' own records about each child.\nAs to the reliability of the completed instruments, the Court observes that during training every case was double-\nread and, after training, every tenth case was double-read. The Court's examination of the compiled instruments\nindicates that they were completed accurately. Moreover, defendants' expert recognizes Dr. Festinger as an\nexpert in the field of social research and has acknowledged that she is \"a very appropriately-acclaimed\n[1]\nindividual;\" he has also cited Dr. Festinger in his own work.\n531 *531 In light of the soundness of plaintiffs' methodology, * * * the Court concludes that plaintiffs' study is a reliable\nevidentiary basis for the Court's findings.\nResults of Sampling\nOf the 149 cases read, 42 indicated maltreatment in the foster home. From this finding, Dr. Festinger projected\nthat 282 children per thousand might be maltreated. Dr. Festinger further commented that if only 14 of the 149\nchildren had actually been maltreated, then 94 children per thousand were likely to have been maltreated during\nthe study period.\nAs of the hearing, plaintiffs had conducted an intensive review of 18 of the 42 cases in which maltreatment was\nindicated during the most recent sampling period of May 1, 1985 through April 30, 1986.\nPlaintiffs believe that the most probative indicators of the current status of the foster care program are these 18\ncases. The 18 cases depict a pattern of physical, sexual and emotional abuses inflicted upon children in the\ncustody of BCDSS.\nThe additional 24 cases are less recent and plaintiffs had not examined them in detail at the time of the hearing.\nFor these additional 24 cases, plaintiffs introduced portions of the casereading instruments where maltreatment\nwas recorded. The Court's review of the submitted documentation on these additional 24 children indicates that\nmaltreatment is likely to have occurred in at least two-thirds of the cases.\n\nInstances of Maltreatment Not Developed By Random Sampling\nPlaintiffs also offered evidence of maltreatment or neglect of 16 other children who came to the attention of the\nLegal Aid Bureau immediately before the filing of the motion for preliminary injunction. Largely uncontroverted\ntestimony from treating physicians, some parents, and documentation submitted to the Court revealed children\nwho had suffered continuous sexual and physical abuse or neglect in foster homes; children who had been\nplaced in homes which defendants knew were inadequate; and cases where reports of abuse were not promptly\nor adequately investigated to prevent further placements of other children in those homes.\nThe tragic consequences of these deficiencies include sexual abuse of young girls by their foster fathers and a\nchild who contracted gonorrhea of the throat after sexual abuse by the adult son of a foster parent in an\n[2]\nunlicensed foster home.  In eight cases, defendants failed to assure that medical treatment prescribed by\nphysicians and basic education were provided.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Court makes the following enumerated findings of fact as to plaintiffs' sampling and the 16 additional cases\nnot developed through sampling:\n1. Dr. Festinger is an expert in the field of social research methodology, foster care systems and child welfare\npolicy.\n2. The Court's review of the casereading instruments indicates that the casereading instruments were completed\naccurately.\n3. Plaintiffs' random sampling study of children in the custody and care of defendants is a sufficient basis for\ndetermining whether systemic problems exist in the Baltimore foster care program.\n532 *532 4. From the Court's review of the case records of the cited 18 children, it is evident that the expressed\nconcerns about the conditions in the foster home and treatment of each child were well-founded in 15 cases.\nIndeed, in some cases the state of the foster home and treatment of the child were cause for grave concern.\n5. The concerns expressed in the additional 24 cases were consistent with those of the 18 cases of most recent\norigin.\n6. When the 18 cases of most recent origin are considered together with the additional 24 cases, the number of\ncases where expressed concerns were well founded very likely exceeds 30.\n7. Where the concerns expressed are all well-founded and verified, the children were at risk of harm to their\nemotional and physical well being.\n8. The number of children at risk out of the sample of 149 is sufficient to indicate that deficiencies exist\nthroughout the foster care system as administered by the BCDSS.\n9. The sample reveals that existing deficiencies include the failure to remove children from homes where physical\nand emotional abuse and neglect are threatened; the licensing of foster homes where foster parents are unable\nto care properly for the children; the granting of \"exceptions\" that allow homes to remain open when they are\nclearly inadequate or a risk to the children in them; the lack of appropriate numbers of satisfactory homes; and\nthe over-reliance on physical evidence of abuse and questioning of children when abuse reports are investigated.\n10. There is a great likelihood that many children in the foster care administered by BCDSS are at risk of\nsuffering irreparable harm.\n\n11. The additional 16 cases of abuse and neglect that were not developed through random sampling cannot be\ndismissed as \"anecdotal.\" Indeed, while the Court does not rely on these cases in concluding that systemic\ndeficiencies exist, these cases corroborate the deficiencies identified through plaintiff's study.\n12. In most of these 16 cases, the situations placing these children at risk were not resolved or confirmed until\ntwo months before or after, the filing of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n(B)\nInadequate Medical Care\nTo support their allegations that foster care children receive inadequate health care, plaintiffs offered the\ntestimony of two medical experts. Dr. Archie Golden is an expert in pediatrics and the administration of health\n[3]\nprograms for children, he has been the medical director of the Chesapeake Health Plan  (\"CHP\") for over six\nyears. Dr. Charles Shubin is an expert in the field of pediatrics and the diagnosis of child abuse and neglect. Drs.\nGolden and Shubin have extensive experience treating foster care children in the custody of BCDSS.\nThe testimony of Drs. Shubin and Golden established that foster children were often abused or neglected in their\nnatural homes and are generally in greater need of health care than other children. Foster children have\nnumerous mental health or psycho-social problems and typically suffer from chronic illnesses; approximately 29%\nhave eye problems; and some 28% of foster children do not have up-to-date immunizations.\nFoster children often receive treatment for one episode of an illness in one facility and visit another for a\nsubsequent episode of the same illness; thus, there is no continuity of information and records about the child's\nhealth treatment and a lower quality of care results.\nFindings of Fact as to Medical Care\nThe Court makes the following enumerated findings of fact about medical care provided foster care children:\n533 *533 1. Of the 2,600 to 2,800 children in BCDSS foster care today, 600 are enrolled in CHP. While most of the\nremaining children do not qualify for CHP enrollment, up to 400 children eligible to participate in CHP are not\nenrolled.\n2. Although many children do not remain in foster care longer than 30 days, and there are no reliable statistics\nabout the number of children who do not appear for medical appointments, it is apparent from the testimony of\nDrs. Shubin and Golden that a major problem in rendering health care to long term foster children is their failure\nto appear at medical appointments. CHP has articulated this concern to BCDSS, but BCDSS has failed to\nrespond adequately.\n3. Physicians treating foster children are often provided incomplete medical histories and must rely on the child\nbeing treated or an older sibling for such information.\n4. The lack of an adequate medical history impairs effective medical treatment and exposes a foster child to such\nrisks as redundant vaccinations or immunization with vaccines to which they may be allergic.\n5. Sometimes natural parent hostility toward BCDSS increases the physician's ability to obtain a complete\nmedical history, and physicians also encounter difficulties obtaining medical histories of children since entering\nfoster care.\n6. Defendants' present system of providing necessary medical care to foster children is inadequate to ensure\ncontinuous and informed treatment for those children.\n(C)\n\nAbsence of Protection Afforded Code 517 Children\nIn 1983, defendants created the \"Code 517\" category of foster children. Although defendants are legally\nresponsible for these children, they are placed in unlicensed homes. The caretakers in these homes, often\nrelatives, are either unwilling to assume approved foster parent status or unable to meet foster home standards.\nCode 517 children are not provided services by the Division of Foster Care Services; their cases are not\nreviewed by the Foster Care Review Board; they are not subject to the review required by Federal law as are\nother foster children, there are no foster care payments for these children, and they are not considered by\ndefendants to be in foster care. Suspected abuse or neglect in \"Code 517\" homes is not reported as foster home\nabuse. As of the commencement of the hearing, there were 312 children who were committed by the Courts to\nBCDSS and placed in the Code 517 category. No evidence of neglect or abuse was presented as to this class of\nchildren. While plaintiffs' suggestion of likely harm to these children from nonsupervision is credible, there is no\nbasis for a finding of systemic abuse or neglect.\n(D)\nThe Harris Task Force and Purported Improvements\nSometime before filing suit in 1984, plaintiffs supplied defendants with a copy of the original complaint in this\ncase. In response, defendants established the \"Harris Task Force\" to conduct a review of the foster care system\nin Baltimore City. The Task Force conducted interviews of several senior staff members at BCDSS. The Task\nForce also conducted a random review of 15 foster care cases including ten involving reports of suspected\nabuse. Based on these interviews and this random sample, the Task Force identified a number of \"systematic\n[4]\nproblems\" and suggested corrective action.\nDefendants purport to have undertaken a number of improvements in the Baltimore foster care system based, in\npart, on the findings of the Harris Task Force.\n534 The Harris Task Force found the following \"major systematic problems\" in the *534 BCDSS foster care program\n(1) the purpose of family care was not well-defined leading, for example, to the placement in foster homes of\nchildren whose needs could not be met within a private home setting; (2) payments to foster families were\nunrealistically low; (3) there were not enough homes, and there was \"no concerted effort to recruit foster homes\";\n(4) licensing of foster homes was inadequate: a lower standard is applied to restricted homes than regular\nhomes, and licensing is based on inadequate information; (5) \"serious gaps\" in the training provided to foster\nfamilies, BCDSS case workers and their supervisors; (6) BCDSS files contained inadequate information about\nmedical histories, foster parents and education; (7) the \"agency's organizational structure is conducive to chaos\";\n(8) some caseworkers and supervisors lacked necessary training; (9) more strict enforcement of policies\nrequiring investigation of abuse and neglect complaints was necessary; (10) the Department of Human\nResources (DHR) needed to improve monitoring of BCDSS to ensure the adequacy of services; (11) substantial\nincreases in staff size were necessary to reduce ratios of cases handled by foster care workers; (12) poor morale\namong BCDSS staff; (13) need for a pre-placement diagnostic facility to place children on an emergency basis\nand identify their problems; (14) need for an automated system to monitor foster care cases; (15) a lack of\ncoordination between BCDSS and agencies outside the city when children were placed outside the city; (16) a\npolicy classification was required for nonlegally responsible custodians who requested a foster care license or\npayments; and (17) poor relationships among BCDSS caseworkers, BCDSS Legal Services, and the Juvenile\nCourts with respect to child placement decisions. The findings of the report are uncontroverted.\nHowever, defendants contend that they have attempted to improve foster care in Baltimore. Among the major\nefforts defendants have undertaken are (1) review of all BCDSS foster homes; (2) training for foster care workers;\n(3) recruitment of new foster parents; (4) increases in foster care board rates; (5) training of foster parents; (6)\nadditional foster care staff to reduce the ratios of caseworker to children to 1 to 20; (7) clarification of lines of\nauthority within the DSS; (8) recruitment of better qualified social workers; (9) medical screening of all children\n\nbefore their placement; (10) development and distribution of a foster care manual and revised policies; and (11)\ninitiation of an intensive family services program.\nFindings of Fact as to Purported Improvements Undertaken Pursuant\nto the Harris Task Force\nThe Court makes the following enumerated findings of fact as to the significance and effectiveness of defendants'\npurported improvements undertaken pursuant to the Harris Task Force:\n1. Many of the most essential of defendants' efforts to improve foster care in Baltimore have been incomplete and\nineffective.\n2. As recommended by the Harris Task Force, defendants undertook a review of all BCDSS foster homes. This\nreview, defendants contend, \"was initiated to determine whether foster children were at risk in their placements.\"\nAs a result of that review, 444 homes were closed in 1985, and 189 were closed in 1986. Defendants contend\nthat as a result of the closings, the pool of BCDSS foster homes is safer now than at the time of the Harris Task\nForce report. However, during cross-examination of Secretary Massinga, it was established that the homes\nclosed were primarily those of elderly foster parents who no longer wanted to be registered as foster homes and\nno longer had foster children in their homes.\n3. During 1985 and 1986, only 53 additional regular or unrestricted foster homes were recruited and opened by\ndefendants. Furthermore, when the hearing commenced, defendants had only one person working solely on\nrecruitment of foster homes.\n4. The \"Intensive Family Services Unit\" at BCDSS, set forth as a recent improvement in foster care, was\ndisbanded in 1986.\n535 5. The Harris Task Force recommended that foster care workers receive training. *535 Defendants have proffered\na document entitled \"Training Sessions for BCDSS Foster Care Workers: 1984-1986.\" During cross-examination\nit was revealed that this document was not what it purported to be, and defendants were unable to offer any\nreliable evidence of training provided to foster care workers.\n6. The Harris Task Force recommended that DHR \"improve its foster care quality control review system.\" DSS\nhas devised a system for case record reviews to evaluate the quality of services provided to foster care children.\nHowever, from January until October, 1986, no quality assurance reviews of foster care records took place.\n7. At the hearing defendants highlighted several policies implemented to protect children in foster care; the\nplaintiffs presented evidence that those policies are violated. Violated were the policies requiring that an\ninvestigation of an abuse report be commenced within 24 hours of its receipt; that no further placements be made\nin a foster home that is the subject of a report of suspected abuse until completion of an investigation; and that all\nchildren be removed from a home where a finding of abuse is \"indicated.\"\n8. Defendants have yet to reduce the ratio of workers to children to 1 to 20.\n9. Given defendants' incomplete and ineffective responses to the systemic problems identified by the Harris Task\nForce in 1984, it is likely that these problems still exist and that significant numbers of foster children are at risk of\nirreparable physical and emotional harm.\n10. Given defendants' ineffective and incomplete responses to the problems identified by the Harris Task Force\nand the ineffective implementation of their own child protection policies, it cannot be assumed that the recent\nincreased funding of some programs will resolve systemic foster care problems.\n\nDiscussion of the Legal Standard for Determining the Propriety of\nPreliminary Injunctive Relief\nThe standard for determining whether a party is entitled to preliminary injunctive relief is the \"balance-of-\nhardship\" test of Blackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig, 550 F.2d 189, 196 (4th Cir.1977). \"This test requires a\n`flexible interplay' among four factors: the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the preliminary injunction\nis denied; the likelihood of harm to the defendant if the requested relief is granted; the likelihood that the plaintiff\nwill succeed on the merits; and the public interest.\" Federal Leasing v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, 650 F.2d 495, 499\n(4th Cir.1981).\nUnder Blackwelder the first consideration is the \"likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff, as balanced against\nthe likelihood of harm to the defendant.\" Federal Leasing, 650 F.2d at 499 (citing Blackwelder, 550 F.2d at 196).\n\"If that balance is struck in favor of plaintiff, it is enough that grave or serious questions are presented; and\nplaintiff need not show likelihood of success.\" Blackwelder, 550 F.2d at 196.

King, 550 F.Supp. 325 (D.Mass.1982),aff'd sub nom., Lynch v. Dukakis, 719 F.2d 504 (1st Cir.1983)\nplaintiffs foster care children brought a class action alleging that Massachusetts' foster care system violated the\ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq. and\n536 regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources. *536 Although plaintiffs\nbrought their action in 1978 plaintiffs did not move for a preliminary injunction until 1981.\nThe evidence in Lynch addressed defendant's compliance with § 608(f) of Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, §\n671(a) of Title IV-E and § 627(a) of Title IV-B which require the development and implementation of a case plan\nfor each child to assure appropriate care and a periodic review of the status of each child to determine the\nappropriateness of placements. The Court found the evidence sufficient to establish noncompliance; however, it\nacknowledged \"certain weaknesses\" in plaintiffs' proof. 550 F.Supp. at 337. In granting plaintiffs a preliminary\ninjunction the Court stated that \"[t]hese flaws are not fatal to plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction,\" because\nthe defendants, \"as the parties having greater access to and control of relevant evidence, have offered little proof\nto rebut the powerful inference that case plans and periodic review are not being provided in significant numbers\nof cases involving children in foster care.\" Id. The Court also found that defendants' apparent failure to comply\nwith the Social Security Act was likely to cause plaintiffs irreparable harm and observed \"[t]he physical and\nemotional damage threatening these children, should it occur, could never be undone.\" 550 F.Supp. at 338. In\nbalancing this harm against that likely to be suffered by the defendants should an injunction be granted, the Court\nquoted defendants' characterization of their hardship as follows:\nThe defendants' interest consists in freedom from a burdensome judicial order that will disrupt the\nmanagement of [DSS], including delivery of the very services plaintiffs seek. For a court to intrude\nin the present case is to risk demoralizing agency personnel and engendering cynicism in an\nimproving administration; to substitute judicial judgment for that of trained professionals and a\nlegalistic atmosphere for a therapeutic one; to risk a confrontation with the state legislature; to risk\nstripping funds from crucial programs in order to pay for others receiving judicial attention; to risk\nforcing the state to give up badly needed federal funds, rather than comply with a far more costly\njudicial order.\nId. at 339.\n\nIn weighing those concerns, the Court agreed that \"it is essential for federal courts to be ever sensitive to these\nconsiderations\" and that \"[e]very federal judge must be concerned about the prospect of issuing relief that unduly\nhampers the day-to-day administration of a state agency.\" Id. Nevertheless, \"concerns of federalism ... are\npresent in any case in which a class of plaintiffs seeks the aid of a federal court in securing state compliance with\nfederal law.\" Id. In concluding that concerns of federalism were outweighed by the prospect of harm to the foster\nchildren, the court held that the need for judicial sensitivity to these concerns does not justify abdication of judicial\nresponsibility. Id.\nHere, Congress00and not any court00created requirements it thought essential to protect the\n97 97\nwelfare of foster children. The Commonwealth voluntarily undertook to fulfill those requirements as\na condition of receiving federal money. Plaintiffs filed suit to enforce those requirements because\nthey believed it would serve their best interests to do so.... In granting preliminary relief to\nplaintiffs, this court does not substitute its judgment for that of state officials. It instead gives\nrealization to the will of Congress and protection requested by those Congress intended to protect.\nIndeed, if the court chose to deny relief on the grounds urged by defendants, that denial would\nreflect a judgment that the wisdom of Congress and desires of plaintiffs should go unheeded\nbecause the Commonwealth knows better than any of them how to serve plaintiffs' interests. This\ncourt is not free to make such a judgment.\n550 F.Supp. at 339-340. Concerning the impact of a preliminary injunction on the public interest the District Judge\nadded:\nCongress imposed these requirements in the belief that they were essential to assure the proper\n537 care of children in the foster care system. The evidence confirms *537 that failure to satisfy the\nCongressional conditions may result in grave harm to foster children. Guided by the\nCongressional determination of the public interest in this context, I conclude that the public\ninterest will be furthered by awarding a remedy calculated to ensure that Massachusetts' foster\ncare system conforms to the dictates of the Social Security Act.\n550 F.Supp. at 340.\nAs preliminary injunctive relief, the Court ordered that the caseload ratio of foster care workers to children be\nreduced to 1:20; that each child's case receive a periodic review every six months; that a written case plan be\nformulated for each child; and that a foster care worker be assigned to each case within 24 hours of its receipt. \nId. at 355-357. Failure to comply with the order would result in a termination of federal funds.\nIn the instant case, the defendants contend that their interests will be impaired by a preliminary injunction;\nhowever, none of these interests outweighs the harm likely to befall plaintiffs should no injunction be issued.\nDefendants argue that the interests underlying principles of federalism preclude the imposition of an injunction. \nBloodgood v. Garraghty, 783 F.2d 470, 475 (4th Cir.1986), is cited for the proposition that it is an abuse of\ndiscretion for a federal court to grant injunctive relief against state officials who have not been found to have\nviolated the law or have shown any intention to violate the law. In addition, defendants argue that the interests of\nthe Maryland state courts require this Court to abstain from deciding the motion for preliminary injunction and cite\nPennzoil Co. v. Texaco, 481 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed. 2d 1 (1987); Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 99 S.Ct.\n2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979); Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); and Cox v.\nPlanning Dist. I Community Mental, Etc., 669 F.2d 940 (4th Cir.1982).\nThis Court agrees that sensitivity to the concerns of federalism are required when a federal court considers\nenjoining state officials. To this end, any relief granted should be tailored to correct ongoing harm in a way that is\nnot overly intrusive. In granting injunctive relief this Court does not substitute its will for that of state officials.\nRather, the Court seeks to enforce the will of Congress as expressed in the foster care provisions of the Social\nSecurity Act and to protect plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\nPlaintiffs have made a showing of threatened irreparable injury. Therefore, the Fourth Circuit's holding in \nBloodgood does not bar an injunction in the instant case; neither is relief barred by the abstention doctrine.\nAbstention to accommodate adjudication by the state courts \"is the exception, not the rule.\" Colorado River Water\n\nConservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1244, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976).\nAbstention is appropriate when a question of federal constitutional law may be mooted by a state court\ndetermination of state law, Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed.\n971 (1941); where unsettled questions of state law affecting important state policy concerns are presented and\nfederal jurisdiction would impair the establishment of a consistent policy, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63\nS.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943); and where federal jurisdiction is sought to restrain a state court proceeding. \nYounger v. Harris, supra.\nHere the Court seeks to enforce a federal statute embodying a federal policy to which defendants committed\nthemselves through their acceptance of federal funds. Also at issue is the right to protection guaranteed plaintiffs\nby the federal constitution. There are no unsettled questions of state law before the Court, nor is any pending\nstate court proceeding to be restrained. Moreover, it is federal policy which is not being served. This case is,\ntherefore, distinguishable from cases where abstention is appropriate. See, e.g., Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, supra\n(federal injunction directly interfered with the execution of a state judgment and challenged the process by which\n538 the judgment was obtained in state court); Moore v. Sims, supra (federal court should have abstained in light of a \n*538 pending state court proceeding on the matter); Younger v. Harris, supra (federal court improperly enjoined a\nstate court proceeding); Cox, supra (abstention appropriate where unsettled question of state law was at issue).\nAlthough the injunction granted herein might not be extremely long in duration, the harm threatening foster\nchildren and the express will of Congress that proper care be extended to these children, indicate that the public\n[5]\ninterest would be served by the granting of a preliminary injunction.\nPlaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to establish the existence of serious systemic deficiencies in the\nBaltimore foster care system. These deficiencies include the failure to implement policies to protect children in\nfoster care; the lack of an effective effort to recruit new foster homes; the licensing of questionable homes; the\ngranting of exceptions allowing homes that should be closed to remain open; and the incomplete medical\nhistories of children in foster care. As a result of these deficiencies, foster children are threatened with and are\nlikely to suffer severe physical and emotional injury. Furthermore, plaintiffs' constitutional right to protection while\n[6]\nin defendants' custody is in jeopardy.  Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction. Blackwelder,\nsupra, at 196.\nLikelihood of Prevailing on the Merits\nAlthough the Court is required to inquire no further, the issues before the Court are of such magnitude and public\nimportance that the Court will address the plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits.\nPlaintiffs have stated claims under Title IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 620 et seq. and\n670 et seq. The defendants have accepted funds under these programs and do not dispute that they are\nobligated to adhere to funding requirements.\nThe federal foster care and adoption assistance program, Title IV-E, requires that defendants \"be responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining standards for foster family homes ... which are reasonably in accord with\nrecommended standards of national organizations concerned with standards for such ... homes.\" 42 U.S.C. § 671\n(a)(10). These should include \"standards relat[ing] to admission policies, safety, sanitation, and protection of civil\nrights....\" Id.\nTitle IV-E and IV-B require defendants to provide for the development of a case plan for each child for the\npurpose of \"assuring that the child receives proper care\" and \"that services are provided to the parents, child, and\nfoster parents in order to improve the conditions in the parents' home....\" 42 U.S.C. § 675(1). The term \"proper\ncare\" as used in the Social Security Act has been interpreted to include necessary medical and educational\n539 services. See, Gary W. v. Louisiana, 437 F.Supp. 1209 (E.D.La.1976). Titles IV-E and IV-B *539 also require a\ncase review system to determine the \"appropriateness of the placement.\" 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(B).\nSystemic problems in the Baltimore foster care program have been revealed by the findings of plaintiffs' study\nand the Harris Task Force. Given the magnitude of these problems as revealed by the evidence received during\n\nthe two week hearing, it appears unlikely that defendants will be able to prove they are in compliance with Title\nIV-E and IV-B.\nPlaintiffs also claim that their Fourteenth Amendment right to protection is being violated by defendants. In \nJensen v. Conrad, 747 F.2d 185 (4th Cir.1984),cert. denied,470 U.S. 1052, 105 S.Ct. 1754, 84 L.Ed.2d 818\n(1985), the Court provided guidance for determining whether an individual has a \"special relationship\" with the\nstate such that a constitutional duty of protection exists. Specifically, the Court enumerated three considerations:\n\"(1) Whether the victim or the perpetrator was in legal custody at the time of the incident, or had been in legal\ncustody prior to the incident ... (2) Whether the state has expressly stated its desire to provide affirmative\nprotection to a particular class or specific individuals ... [and] (3) Whether the state knew of the claimants'\nplight....\" 747 F.2d at 194-195. n. 11.\nApplying these factors, the Court finds plaintiffs have demonstrated the existence of a \"special relationship\" with\ndefendants such that plaintiffs are owed an affirmative duty of protection by defendants. Here defendants\nundertook to provide plaintiffs with proper care and defendants have known, or had reason to know, of systemic\ndeficiencies since the Harris Task Force report. Most importantly, plaintiffs are vulnerable children in the custody\nof defendants.\nChildren in similar circumstances have been held to have a right to protection. In Estate of Bailey by Oare v.\nCounty of York, 768 F.2d 503 (3d Cir.1985), a civil rights complaint was brought against a county welfare agency\nby the father of a five-year-old girl who was beaten to death by her mother and mother's boyfriend. The welfare\nagency had previously determined that the child had been abused and agreed to return the child to the mother\nonly upon the condition that the boyfriend be denied access to the child. The complaint alleged that the agency\nreturned the child to the mother without conducting an independent investigation to determine whether the child's\nmother and the mother's boyfriend were living together. 768 F.2d at 505. Following the Jensen analysis, the Court\ndetermined that a \"special relationship\" had existed between the child and the agency sufficient to state a claim\nbased on a duty to protect. Id. at 510-511. See also Doe v. New York City Department of Social Services, 649\nF.2d 134 (2nd Cir.1981),cert. denied,464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983) (Court held that an\nagency that placed a child in foster care could be liable for the child's sexual abuse by her foster parent if the\nagency had failed to supervise adequately the child's placement.).\nHaving determined that plaintiffs have a \"special relationship\" with defendants such that an affirmative duty to\nprotect exists, this Court must determine whether plaintiffs are required to show that defendants have acted with\n\"deliberate indifference\" to that right. Regardless of whether \"deliberate indifference\" must be proven, the\nevidence in this case shows that, at least since the Harris Task Force report, defendants have been aware of\nserious deficiencies in the system and their tragic consequences. For example, the evidence shows that one\nmajor problem with the system is the lack of satisfactory foster homes. Yet as of the hearing, only one person\nworked solely on recruiting homes for BCDSS. Moreover, only 53 new nonrestrictive homes were opened in 1985\nand 1986. In order to compensate for the lack of homes, defendants have placed children in homes that are\nunsatisfactory and are reluctant to close homes where maltreatment is either suspected or confirmed.\n540 The defendants' duty to protect and the systemic nature of the BCDSS failure to *540 perform that duty create a\nclear likelihood of plaintiffs' success on the merits.\n* * * * * *\nTherefore, it is this 27th day of July, 1987, by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland,\nORDERED:\nAs to plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction,\n1. That plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction BE, and the same hereby IS, GRANTED.\n2. That defendants shall submit to the Court within 20 days, a plan for a review of each foster\nhome in which a report of maltreatment has been made and in which foster children continue to\n\nreside to ensure that such home meets licensing standards reasonably in accord with those\nrecommended by nationally recognized professional organizations.\n3. That defendants shall monitor each child in a DSS foster family home by, at least, monthly visits\nto the child to ensure that the child is receiving proper care and the foster home continues to meet\nlicensing standards. Where there has been a report of maltreatment of the child and the child\nremains in the home, the child shall be visited at least weekly.\n4. That defendants shall assign sufficient staff and resources to ensure that available medical\nhistories are obtained and provided to children's medical and other service providers, including\nfoster parents, to ensure that appropriate medical preventive care, services, treatment and\ndiagnoses and other care are promptly and appropriately provided in accord with approved\nmedical standards.\n5. That defendants shall provide a written copy of any complaint of maltreatment of a foster child\nto the juvenile court and the child's attorney within five days of its receipt and shall provide to the\njuvenile court and the child's attorney a written report of any action taken on the complaint within\nfive days of its disposition by the agency.\n(s) Joseph C. Howard United States District Judge \nDATED: July 27, 1987\n[1] The full decree is attached as Addendum A to this Memorandum.\n[2] For a detailed review of the methodology used in plaintiffs' random sampling see the court's Memorandum\nand Order dated July 27, 1987, attached to this opinion as Addendum B.\n[3] The court also granted plaintiffs' motions for sanctions due to certain conduct of defendants' attorneys.\nSpecifically, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) and 16(f), the court ordered it taken as established that\ndefendants \"fail to protect effectively children in foster homes where there is reason to know that such children\nare at risk of harm to their physical and emotional well-being.\" Having deemed these facts admitted, the court\nfound plaintiffs also entitled to preliminary injunction on this alternative basis. \nThe court's Memorandum and Order dated July 27, 1987 has been attached to this memorandum as Addendum\nB. That memorandum has been edited to eliminate the court's detailed discussion of its basis for imposing\nsanctions because those facts do not serve as part of the basis for the court's determination of whether the\ndecree is fair and adequate.\n[4] In the same opinion, the Fourth Circuit also affirmed this court's ruling that the defendants were not entitled to\nqualified immunity as to plaintiffs' claims for damages. 838 F.2d at 123-124. On that issue, defendants have\npetitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.\n[5] The Legal Aid Bureau of Maryland, whose lawyers serve as lead counsel to the class plaintiffs in this action,\nprovides legal services to and represents the great majority of Baltimore's foster children in the juvenile court.\nThe notice also was mailed to the Office of the Superintendent of the Baltimore City Public School, the State's\nAttorney for Baltimore City, the Baltimore City Juvenile Court judge and masters and to organizations that provide\nmedical care to foster children.\n[6]The Baltimore Sun, The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Afro-American and The Daily Record.\n[7] Specifically, in this regard, Mr. Holmes states in his affidavit that: \nI am aware of the Court's special concerns about foster home recruitment. It must be remembered that family\nfoster care is not the only, and often not even most appropriate, out-of-home placement for children, particularly\nthose increasing numbers with severe emotional and behavioral problems. DHR has and will continue to intensify\nefforts to recruit foster parents. Providing child care for working foster parents is an effective recruitment tool.\nDHR and BCDSS both have aggressive campaigns to solicit applications from new families. DHR has contracted\n\nwith Vanita Enterprises, Inc., a media consulting firm, to devise and implement a recruitment campaign, which\nbegan April 15, 1988, and includes: regular and frequent public service announcements on 12 television and 32\nradio stations with Tim and Daphne Reid, Brooks Robinson, John Minor, Rev. Sidney Daniels and Alex Williams;\ntwo foster/adoptive care olympic events scheduled in August, 1988; direct mail to Maryland teachers and\nministers; and corporate sponsorship of paid network spots. Preliminary results include 195 inquiries from\nparents interested in becoming foster or adoptive parents.\nBCDSS' own efforts have resulted in 43 new foster homes from January 1 through May 31, 1988 out of a total of\n168 applications. Recruitment activities have included: paid ads on WBGR-AM, public service announcements on\nthe major television stations, recruitment booths at city fairs, hospitals, the Social Security Administration and the\nGeneral Motor plant, subway posters, articles in selected employee newsletters and a speakers's bureau to\ncommunity groups and churches.\n[8] The defendants' memorandum furnished in support of the decree, the affidavits of Mr. Holmes and Ms.\nBernard, and the presentation of defendants' counsel made during the settlement hearing of July 18, 1988,\nprovide valuable details as to what measures defendants will undertake in order to meet the requirements set\nforth in the decree. The court has not asked that the decree be amended to recite specific efforts that will be\nmade by defendants to meet the requirements of the decree. It was the intent of the parties to allow the\ndefendants flexibility in implementation of the decree's provisions. \nNevertheless, in evaluating the decree, the court relies on the parties' representations as to specific measures\nthat will be undertaken and may later utilize those representations as a standard through which good faith in\ncarrying out the terms of the decree will be measured. Accordingly, the court fully expects the defendants to\nundertake those specific measures revealed to the court or to undertake measures comparable to them. The\ncourt is confident that defendants will make every effort to do so.\n[9] In a letter to the court dated July 14, 1988, the Foster Care Review Board estimated that as many as 2,000\nchildren are placed with relatives.\n[10] There are 24 citizen Foster Care Review Boards in Baltimore City with seven members each. The Boards\nprovide independent citizen input as to whether BCDSS plans for each child in foster care is appropriate.\n[11] The Board also expressed concern about proper training of foster care workers; that provisions be made for\nchildren placed with relatives; and that visits to foster homes be meaningful. The court believes the decree's\nprovisions for training of foster care workers are adequate. The provisions implemented immediately for children\nplaced with relatives are also adequate pending the earlier described independent assessment of the status of\nthose children. Lastly, if the visits to homes cannot be carried out with the maximum ratios of children-to-workers\nprovided by the decree, the defendants will be required to reduce the workers' case loads below the maximum\nratios.\n[1] Defendants' expert undertook a study of the population of children in foster care in Baltimore which was\nsimilar in many ways to that conducted by Dr. Festinger. In that study defendants expert examined the health\nstatus of foster children. The methodology used was a random sampling of foster care records from which were\nexcluded the files for children who were placed in group or institutional care; children who remained in foster care\nfor less than 30 days; and children whose case records could not be located. From those case records that met\nhis sample criteria, defendants' expert concluded that scant information is kept as children's medical history; that\na concerted effort needed to be made by BCDSS to insure that such information is available for use; that BCDSS\nneeded to improve the adequacy of attention to health needs; and that there had to be sufficient personnel and\nbudgetary resources necessary to attend to the health needs of children.\n[2] See Appendix 2 for additional summary of these 16 cases. [Editor's Note: Appendix 2 was omitted from\npublication.]\n[3] The CHP was established as a private health maintenance organization in 1976 to provide for the health\nneeds of foster children. A health maintenance organization for foster children was desirable because they\nusually have special health needs and a history of noncontinuous or episodic care.\n\n[4] Although defendants attack the validity of the methodology used by plaintiffs in their random sampling,\ndefendants do not take issue with the Harris Task Force's findings of systemic deficiencies based on a review of\nfifteen foster care cases.\n[5] At the hearing, defendants also contended that a preliminary injunction was inappropriate because trial of this\nmatter is scheduled for November. The trial date is, however, tentative at best. Neither defendants nor plaintiffs\nwere able to complete discovery within the time allowed by the current Scheduling Order in this case. In\nrequesting an extension of the discovery deadline, defendants contend that they are unable to commence\ndiscovery until plaintiffs' discovery is completed. Following the completion of discovery, a period for filing and\nruling on additional motions is anticipated. \nIn the unlikely event that trial is able to go forward in November, it would last all month. The need for post-trial\nbriefs on an issue of this gravity might consume December, and, because of the voluminous amounts of\ndocuments likely to be introduced into evidence, the Court would probably require until late April or early May to\nissue a ruling.\nDefendants suggest that a preliminary injunction is unnecessary because policies and programs which they are\nimplementing should satisfy plaintiffs' concerns. However, this argument carries little weight in light of defendants'\nfailure to effectively implement current programs and policies.\n[6] Plaintiffs have demonstrated systemic deficiencies in the foster care system with direct personal injuries\ntraceable to defendants' conduct. Accordingly, the Court need not address defendants' reliance on Allen v.\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) for the proposition that no real controversy exists,\nand that plaintiffs here prosecute a mere \"generalized grievance.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
