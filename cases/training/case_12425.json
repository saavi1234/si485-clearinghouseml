The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants maintained a pattern or practice that had a discriminatory impact on minority applicants in their home financing policies and practices. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' policy authorizing unchecked, subjective surcharge of additional points and fees to an otherwise objective risk-based financing rate, had a discriminatory impact on minority homeowners, creating a significantly higher likelihood of exposure to discretionary points and fees. The plaintiffs sought injunctive, declaratory and monetary relief. On February 12, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.</p><p>On March 27, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Court (Judge Rya W. Zabel) granted the motion in relation to H&R Block Inc., but not in relation to its subsidiaries. However, the plaintiff could move to add H&R Block Inc. as a defendant after discovery. On July 9, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The complaint added several named plaintiffs.</p><p>On June 21, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class. On March 21, 2011, the motion was granted, subject to limitation by time. A class of \"[a]ll African-American borrowers who obtained a mortgage loan from one of the Defendants\" was certified. However, three months later, the Supreme Court decided Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011). The defendants filed a motion to decertify class On October 6, 2011, in light of that case. On September 18, 2012, the Court granted the motion and decertified class. After Wal-Mart, there was no longer sufficient evidence to satisfy the commonality requirement. Statistical analysis was no longer sufficient, and the plaintiffs could not show a common method of exercising discretion by the brokers. On February 7, 2013, the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs' appeal.</p><p>On August 21, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice. That ended the case.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs\nare African-American homeowners who bring suit on behalf of themselves and similarly\nsituated homeowners against H&R Block, Inc. (“H&R Block”), and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, San Canyon Corp., f/k/a Option One Mortgage Corporation (“Option One”)\nand Ada Services Corporation, f/k/a H&R Block Mortgage Corporation (“H&R Block\nMortgage”) (collectively, “Option One” or “Defendants”).2 \nThe gravamen of Plaintiffs’ complaint is that H&R Block and Option One violated\n1H&R Block Bank, a Federal Savings Bank, Member FDIC, was named as a\ndefendant but has since been voluntarily dismissed from the action.  H&R Block, Inc.\nwas dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The only defendants remaining are\nOption One Mortgage Corporation and Option One Mortgage Services, Inc., which\nbecame the new name of H&R Mortgage Services in July 2007. \n2Plaintiffs are Cecil Barrett, Jr., Cynthia Barrett, Jean Blanco Guerrier, Angelique\nM. Bastien, Jacqueline Grissett, Craig Grissett, Steven Parham, Betty and Edward\nHoffman, Doris Murray, Joslyn Day and Keisha Chavers (collectively “Plaintiffs”),\n\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f (“ECOA”), and the Fair\nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”),3 by giving its authorized brokers\ndiscretion to impose additional charges to the borrower’s wholesale mortgage loans\nunrelated to a borrower’s creditworthiness, a policy that had a disparate impact on\nAfrican-American borrowers in that it resulted in their being charged higher rates than\nsimilarly situated whites.4\nPlaintiffs now move to certify a class of “[a]ll African-American borrowers who\nobtained a mortgage loan from one of the Defendants between January 1, 2001 and\nthe [d]ate of [j]udgment” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  See Docket #\n74, Pl.’s Mem. in Support of Mot. for Class Certification at 17. \nI. Background\nPlaintiffs Cecil and Cynthia Barrett (“the Barretts”) purchased their home in 2004\nfor approximately $277,000.  See Second Am. Compl. ¶ 76.  They refinanced the\n3The ECOA provides that it is unlawful “for any creditor to discriminate against\nany applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction-(1) on the basis of\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant\nhas the capacity to contract).” 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a).  Similarly, the FHA makes it\nunlawful “for any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in\nresidential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making\navailable such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction,\nbecause of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” 42\nU.S.C. § 3605(a).\n4This court previously concluded that disparate impact claims are cognizable\nunder both the FHA and ECOA.  See Order Denying Mot. to Dismiss (Docket # 45) at\n3-5; see also Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d, 43, 49 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(disparate impact claims allowable under FHA); and Miller v. Countrywide Bank, N.A.,\n571 F. Supp. 2d 251, 256-257 (D. Mass. 2008) (disparate impact claims allowable\nunder ECOA).\n2\n\nmortgage on their home in Mattapan, Massachusetts, in 2005, taking out a $416,000\nloan with a 30-year term and a disclosed Annual Percentage Rate, or “APR,” of 8.653\npercent.  Id. at ¶¶ 77-78.  The Barretts were assisted by Money-Wise Solutions, a\nmortgage broker authorized to originate loans with Option One.  Id. at ¶ 79.  On April 6,\n2006, they again refinanced.  Id. at ¶ 81.  That loan, also with Option One, was for\n$500,000, and had an adjustable rate with a balloon feature, providing for a final\npayment of $344,113.90.  Id. at ¶ 82.  The APR on the second loan was 10.536%.  Id. \nThe remaining plaintiffs similarly used brokers to obtain wholesale mortgage loans from\nOption One and allege that they were charged a higher APR than similarly-situated\nwhites.\nH&R Block made home mortgage loans to consumers through its subsidiaries,\nH&R Block Mortgage and Option One.  See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23, 49.  Option One\nwas primarily a wholesale mortgage lender and offered its services through its\nbranches and a national network of mortgage brokers.  Id. at ¶ 22. \nIn the wholesale mortgage lender market, independent mortgage brokers act as\nintermediaries between borrowers and lenders like Option One.  A broker identifies\nprospective borrowers, facilitates the loan origination process, and transmits\nprospective borrowers’ respective applications to lenders for a determination of whether\nor not to grant the loan.  This reliance on brokers enabled Option One to fund\nmortgages in areas where it had not established any retail presence of its own.  Option\nOne worked with numerous authorized brokers when it was in the wholesale mortgage\nbusiness, which it abandoned in late 2007.  Between 2001 and 2007, H&R Block\n3\n\nMortgage’s subprime retail originations represented approximately 10% of Option\nOne’s overall loan origination volume. \nThe pricing of Option One’s mortgage loans was comprised of an objective and a\nsubjective component.  According to Plaintiffs, when a proposed borrower applied for a\nloan, Option One first computed a risk-based financing rate (the “Par Rate”) based on\nobjective criteria of creditworthiness, such as FICO score, property value, and\nloan-to-value ratio to determine credit parameters, and set prices for its loan products.\nThis information was communicated to brokers on a rate sheet listing Option One’s\n“par” interest rate, which did not result in any broker compensation.  That objective\ncomponent of loan pricing is not at issue here.\n Option One also authorized a subjective component in its credit pricing system\n(the “Discretionary Pricing Policy”), which governed brokers' compensation for their\nservices.  This is the policy at issue.  Under this policy, brokers were permitted to set\ninterest rates higher than the par rate, as well as to charge loan origination and\nprocessing fees.  Option One paid brokers a “yield spread premium” or “rebate” when\nthey did so.  Brokers were paid more for loans that cost the borrower more, though their\ntotal compensation was capped at 5 percent of the loan amount.  As the name implies,\nthere were no objective criteria for the imposition of these higher rates and fees, which\nwere set by the brokers in their discretion.  These discretionary charges were\nnegotiated between the broker and borrower as part of the total finance charge (the\n“Contract APR”), without specific disclosure that a portion of the Contract APR was a\nnon-risk related charge. \n4\n\n Option One, along with H&R Block and H&R Block Mortgage, jointly established\nthe Discretionary Pricing Policy and participated in the decisions to grant credit to\nborrowers.  (Id. ¶¶ 53-54.)  Option One monitored the fees charged by its brokers to\nensure they complied with its policies.\nPlaintiffs allege that “by design,” the Discretionary Pricing Policy “caused\npersons with identical or similar credit scores to pay different amounts for the cost of\ncredit.”  (Id. ¶ 68.)  Although facially neutral, the policy had an adverse effect on\nAfrican-Americans in that they paid higher discretionary charges on their home loans\nthan did similarly situated white borrowers.  Plaintiffs bring these claims under a\ndisparate impact theory, challenging “practices that are facially neutral in their\ntreatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than\nanother and cannot be justified by business necessity.” Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15 (1977).\nII. Legal Standard\nTo obtain class certification, plaintiffs must satisfy four requirements of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(a) as well as one of several requirements of Rule 23(b). \nSmilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).\nRule 23(a) provides that a class may be certified only if “(1) the class is so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or\nfact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n5\n\nCourts have characterized this rule to require plaintiffs to satisfy the requirements of\nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy.  See Smilow, 323 F.3d at 38.  \nRule 23(b) allows for several different types of class actions.  Plaintiffs seek to\ncertify the class under Rule 23(b)(3) which requires a showing “that the questions of\nlaw or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for\nfairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). \nBefore certifying a class, courts are required to engage in “a rigorous analysis of\nthe prerequisites established by Rule 23.”  In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export\nAntitrust Litigation, 522 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir. 2008).  Accordingly, when considering\ndisputed issues for class certification, a district court may “probe behind the pleadings\nto formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out.” DeRosa v.\nMassachusetts Bay Commuter Rail Co., 694 F. Supp. 2d 87, 95 (D. Mass. 2010)\n(citations omitted).  However, the court may not consider whether the party seeking\nclass certification has stated a cause of action or is likely to prevail on the merits.  See\nIn re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, 471 F.3d 24, 36-37 (2d Cir. 2006).  A\ndistrict court must certify a class if it concludes that the moving party has met its burden\nof proof on each element.\nIII. Analysis\nA.  Rule 23(a)\n1. Numerosity\nUnder Rule 23(a)(1), the numerosity requirement is met if “the class is so\n6\n\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”\nFrom 2001 through 2007, Option One made at least 130,000 wholesale and\nretail loans to African-American borrowers located across the United States. \nDefendants do not dispute that the numerosity requirement has been met.\n2. Commonality\nTo demonstrate commonality under Rule 23(a)(2), Plaintiffs must establish\n“common questions of law and fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  It is not necessary that\nmembers of the proposed class share every fact in common or present identical legal\nissues.  See In re Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. Securities Litig., 03-cv-10165-RWZ,\n2005 WL 3178162, at *2 (D. Mass. Nov. 28, 2005) (internal quotations omitted). \nRather, the rule requires “a sufficient constellation of common issues [that] binds class\nmembers together.”  Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 296 (1st\nCir. 2000).   In actions based on disparate impact, commonality is satisfied if the lawsuit\n“tend[s] to show the existence of a class of persons affected by a company-wide policy\nor practice of discrimination.”  Attenborough v. Const. and General Bldg. Laborers’\nLocal 79, 238 F.R.D. 82, 95 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).  Individual factual differences among the\nputative class members will not preclude a finding of commonality.  See Armstrong v.\nDavis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001). \nTo make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the disparate impact\ntheory, a plaintiff must (1) identify the specific practice being challenged; and (2) show\nthat it effected different results in different populations.  See Watson v. Ft. Worth Bank\nand Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994-995 (1988).  “[I]t is not enough to simply allege that there\n7\n\nis a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an\nimpact.  Rather, the [plaintiff] is responsible for isolating and identifying the specific ...\npractices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.”  See\nSmith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 241 (2005) (internal quotations omitted). \nMoreover, “[p]roof of disparate impact is based not on an examination of individual\nclaims, but on a statistical analysis of the class as a whole.”  In re Wells Fargo\nResidential Mortg. Lending Discrimination Litigation, 08-md-01930, 2010 WL 4791687,\n*2 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (internal citations omitted).\nOnce the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disparate impact, the\nburden of proof shifts to the defendant, who may either discredit the plaintiff’s statistics\nor proffer its own computations to demonstrate that no disparity exists.  See Watson,\n487 U.S. at 996-97.\nFirst, Option One argues that the named Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the requirement\nof commonality because the results of an aggregated statistical regression cannot\nsupply classwide proof of discrimination, particularly where individual Plaintiffs did\nreceive a lower APR.5  It relies on its studies that the majority of putative class\n5Citing Stastny v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 628 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1980),\nDefendants further contend that delegation of discretion cannot, as a matter of law,\nform the policy required to make out a claim of disparate impact discrimination.  This\nargument is unavailing.  It is not the delegation of discretion that constitutes the policy,\nbut rather the existence of a commonly applied practice that satisfies the requirement. \nSee Watson v. Fort Worth Bank, 487 U.S. 977 (1988) (policies which designate\ndiscretionary authority to individual actors are actionable if they have a verifiable\ndiscriminatory impact on a protected class); see also Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\n603 F.3d 571, 612 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (same). \n Moreover, this court previously held that Plaintiffs adequately identified the\npractice at issue, namely “establishing a par rate keyed to objective indicators of\n8\n\nmembers paid an amount that was statistically the same as they would have paid had\nthey been white, and that another 2.6% of class members paid an amount less than\npredicted.  Defendants contend that such disparities as existed are explainable not by\nrace but by factors such as geography and the individual broker.  Second, Defendants\ncontend that individualized pricing, changes in policy, and other practices preclude\nclasswide adjudication of Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nPlaintiffs demonstrate common questions of fact and law through the expert\nreport of Yale Law School Professor Dr. Ian Ayres (“Professor Ayres”), whose analysis\nof Option One’s mortgage data leads him to conclude that the Discretionary Pricing\nPolicy did have a disparate impact on minority borrowers because “African Americans\npaid more for Option One mortgage loans than whites with similar risk-characteristics.” \nDocket # 89-3, Report of Professor Ayres (“Ayres Report”) at 6, ¶ 10.  In his study,\nProfessor Ayres compares the annual percentage rate, or “APR,” paid by white and\nminority borrowers for Option One wholesale loans originated from 2001 to 2007.  He\nfinds that the mean APR for African-Americans was 9.876%, as compared with a mean\nAPR of 9.415% for whites, a difference of 0.461%.  See Ayres Report at 7, ¶ 10. \nTo compare similarly situated whites and minorities, Professor Ayres also\nperformed regression analysis, a statistical method that allows him to control for\nlegitimate risk factors that may affect the cost of a loan.  Controlling for such risk\nfactors, he concluded that the APRs of African-Americans are 0.086% higher than\ncreditworthiness while simultaneously authorizing additional charges keyed to factors\nunrelated to those criteria.”  Barrett v. H & R Block, 08-cv-10157-RWZ (Docket # 45) at\n7. \n9\n\nthose of similarly situated whites, resulting in an average payment of $134 more per\nyear for each of the former group’s loans.  Professor Ayres’ study relies entirely on\nevidence common to the class and does not require any individualized inquiry.\nThe central question of fact and law is common to the class.  Plaintiffs assert\nthat the discretionary pricing strategy they challenge was executed uniformly, and its\nadverse effects were felt in the same way by Plaintiffs and all class members. \nTherefore, common questions include whether Option One’s policy resulted in a pricing\ndisparity between white and minority borrowers and whether those disparities are\njustified by legitimate risk factors.\nDefendants dispute commonality through their own expert, Dr. Darius Palia (“Dr.\nPalia”), Professor of Finance and Economics at Rutgers Business School, who asserts\nthat there is no evidence that there was “a commonly applied ‘Discretionary Pricing\nPolicy’ that was the cause of a class-wide disparate impact on African-American\nborrowers.”  See Docket # 89-1 (Rebuttal Report of Dr. Palia dated May 4, 2010,\nhereinafter “Palia Report”).\nUsing Professor Ayres’ numbers, Dr. Palia replicated Professor Ayres’ exact\nregression analysis to highlight alleged errors.  Dr. Palia points to two major flaws in\nProfessor Ayres’ analysis.  First, he argues that the Ayres regression model was\nimproperly applied to the aggregate, and not separately to the individual mortgage\nbrokers that used the so-called “Discretionary Pricing Policy.”  If such a policy had, in\nfact, been applied, “the disparate impact caused by the policy should be observed\nconsistently across the various brokers that applied it”; if not, “that would suggest that\n10\n\nloan pricing is the result of individualized decision-making rather than the result of a\ncommon policy.”  Second, Dr. Palia contends that Professor Ayres’ failure to apply his\nregression model separately to local geographic markets in which borrowers applied for\nand obtained their mortgage loans renders his conclusions inaccurate.  After\ncompleting his own analysis, Dr. Palia concluded: “(1) the statistical evidence does not\nshow any common pattern of disparate impact against African-American borrowers\neither across the brokers that originated the loans or across the geographic markets in\nwhich the largest numbers of loans were originated; (2) even among the minority of\nbrokers and geographic markets in which African-Americans experienced statistically\nhigher APRs than similarly-situated whites, there is no common cause of such pricing\ndifferences; and (3) nine of ten loans extended to named plaintiffs had APRs that were\nnot statistically different from the APR that would have been predicted had the\nborrowers been white.”\nAlthough Defendants hotly dispute the merits of Professor Ayres’ analysis, it has\nlong been the rule that disputes about the respective experts’ statistics are tantamount\nto disputes about the parties’ proof of the merits and are not grounds for denying class\ncertification.  See In re Initial Public Offerings Securities Litigation, 471 F.3d 24, 35 (2d\nCir. 2006) (experts’ disagreement on whether a discriminatory impact could be shown is\na disagreement as to the merits, and is not a valid basis for denying class certification). \nStatistical disputes in civil rights cases “encompass the basic merits inquiry and need\nnot be proved to raise common questions and demonstrate the appropriateness of\n11\n\nclass resolution.”  Id. at 594.6  Plaintiffs have satisfied the commonality requirement.\n3. Typicality\nA plaintiff may represent a class only if his or her claims are “typical” of those of\nthe putative class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  In general, a plaintiff's claim is typical\nif it “arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the\nclaims of other class members, and if his or her claims are based on the same legal\ntheory.”  In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 230 F.R.D. 61, 78 (D.\nMass. 2005).  Where, however, “a named plaintiff may be subject to unique defenses\nthat would divert attention from the common claims of the class, that plaintiff cannot be\nconsidered typical of the class.”  In re Bank of Boston Corp. Securities Litigation, 762\nF.Supp. 1525, 1532 (D. Mass. 1991).  While commonality “examines the relationship of\nfacts and legal issues common to class members,” typicality “focuses on the\nrelationship of facts and issues between the class and its representatives.”  Dukes v.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 613 n. 37 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).\nHere, Plaintiffs contend that their claims are typical because Option One made\nloans to each Plaintiff under the same subjective Discretionary Pricing Policy to which\nthe class was subjected.\nOption One counters that the named Plaintiffs are not typical for two reasons: (1)\n6Defendants contend that arguments that one party’s statistics are “unreliable or\nbased on an unaccepted method” must be resolved at the certification stage.  See\nDukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 591-592 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc). \nHere, however, Defendants do not contend that the statistical analysis was based on\nan unaccepted method.  Rather, they contend that Dr. Ayres’ model produces results\nwhich do not prove a disparate impact caused by any policy. \n12\n\nsome have suffered no injury in connection with their loans and therefore lack standing;\nand (2) individualized defenses demonstrate that there is no “typical” named plaintiff. \ni. Standing\nDefendants assert that certain Plaintiffs were not injured because they received\nloans that were priced more favorably than similarly situated white borrowers.  Further\nthey argue that Plaintiffs’ reliance on Dr. Ayres’ conclusions of disadvantage to African-\nAmerican borrowers as a group does not support the inference that the named Plaintiffs\nwere so disadvantaged.  Absent such individualized evidence, the named Plaintiffs are\nnot typical of the class they represent, and thus lack standing. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the disparate impact was the result of the\nDiscretionary Pricing Policy, a common practice that governed the pricing of all class\nmembers’ mortgages.  The named Plaintiffs were subject to that policy, and have\nadvanced a viable theory showing that it produced harm.  That is sufficient to satisfy\nthe typicality requirement.\nii. Individualized Defenses\nNext, Defendants contend that the individual circumstances surrounding each\nnamed Plaintiff’s loans expose each to individual defenses which defeat typicality.  In\nparticular, Defendants contend that several Plaintiffs submitted loan applications which\ncontained false information, subjecting them to a defense of unclean hands.  This\nargument is unavailing.  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that because the purpose of\nthe ECOA is to eradicate discrimination, the unclean hands defense is not available to  \nquestion liability.  See McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U.S. 352,\n13\n\n356-57, 360 (1995) (holding that the unclean hands defense “has not been applied\nwhere Congress authorizes broad equitable relief to serve important national policies”\nincluding civil rights statutes such as the ADEA); see also Moore v. U.S. Department of\nAgriculture, 55 F.3d 991, 995-96 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding that an unclean hands\ndefense did not defeat liability under the ECOA).  \nFinally, Defendants say that the necessity for an individualized statute of\nlimitations defense determination defeats typicality.  This, too, is without merit.  First,\nthis court has already ruled against Defendant’s statute of limitations defense with\nrespect to the named Plaintiffs when it denied their motion to dismiss.  Second, all\nnamed Plaintiffs but one filed within the requisite time.  Third, at the class certification\nstage, a court’s analysis of unique defenses focuses on whether those defenses will\n“unacceptably detract from the focus of the litigation to the detriment of absent class\nmembers.”  Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 222 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir.\n2000).  Here, any statute of limitations defense will not do so. \n4. Adequacy\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the proposed class representatives “fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.” This requirement has two parts.  Plaintiffs\nmust first demonstrate that “the interests of the representative party will not conflict with\nthe interests of any of the class members,” and second, that “counsel chosen by the\nrepresentative party is qualified, experienced and able to vigorously conduct the\nproposed litigation.”  In re M3 Power Razor System Marketing & Sales Practice\nLitigation, 270 F.R.D. 45, 55 (D. Mass. 2010) (citing Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp.,\n14\n\n780 F.2d 124, 130 (1st Cir. 1985)). \nOption One does not dispute the adequacy of these class representatives, and\nthe court discerns no conflicts between Plaintiffs and any members of the class. \nAccordingly, all four requirements of Rule 23(a) have been met.\nB. Rule 23(b)(3)\nAs they request certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs must present\nevidence showing the predominance of common issues and the superiority of a class\naction. The court now turns to these two requirements.\n1. Predominance\nRule 23(b)(3) requires the court to find “that the questions of law or fact common\nto class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”\nThis predominance requirement “tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently\ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation” and is a “far more demanding”\nstandard than Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement.  Amchem Prod., Inc. v. Windsor,\n521 U.S. 591, 623-24 (1997).  The Rule is intended to ensure “that common issues\npredominate, not that all issues be common to the class.”  In re Transkaryotic\nTherapies, Inc. Securities Litigation, 2005 WL 3178162, *2 (D. Mass. 2005) (citations\nomitted). \nOption One disputes predominance by reiterating its arguments against\ncommonality.  The disparity in APR is explained not by race, Option One argues, but by\nother legitimate variables.\nThe key question again is whether Option One’s Discretionary Pricing Policy had\n15\n\na disparate impact, that is, whether it fell “more harshly on one group than another and\ncannot be justified by business necessity.” Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431\nU.S. 324, 335 n. 15 (1977).  Since the claim is disparate impact, the relevant evidence\nwill focus on “statistical disparities, rather than specific incidents, and on competing\nexplanations for those disparities.”  Watson v. Ft. Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977,\n987 (1988). \nProfessor Ayres’ analysis provides evidence of the disparate impact on a class-\nwide basis.  Competing explanations for those disparities are examined by way of\nregression analyses that assess the effect of competing variables.  Option One can\ndefend against Plaintiffs’ case either by demonstrating that its discretionary policy had\na valid business justification, or by challenging the statistical basis for Plaintiffs’ claim. \nIn either case, the legal contention applies across the class.  Thus, Plaintiffs have\ncarried their burden of showing the predominance of common questions.\n2. Superiority\nThe final requirement for class certification is “that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(b)(3).  The pertinent factors in assessing superiority are “the class members’\ninterests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions” and\n“the likely difficulties in managing a class action.”  Id.  Superiority exists where “there is\na real question whether the putative class members could sensibly litigate on their own\nfor these amounts of damages, especially with the prospect of expert testimony\nrequired.”  Gintis v. Bouchard Transp. Co., Inc., 596 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 2010).\n16\n\nIt would be neither economically feasible nor efficient for class members to\npursue these claims against Option One individually.  The amounts recoverable for\nindividual class members are too low for class members to bring individual claims.  The\nclass action is manageable because liability will be determined based on statistical\nproof, and remedies can be calculated on a class-wide basis.  A class is therefore\nsuperior to other methods for adjudicating these claims.\nC. Class Period\nWhile the result on the merits is by no means certain, the proposed class\nsatisfies the requirements of Rule 23, and class certification is appropriate.  However,\nseveral questions remain unresolved.  Most notably, the proposed dates of the\nbeginning and end of the class period are left singularly unsubstantiated.  Moreover, it\nis unclear how and when Option One began to identify loan applicants by race.  \nD. Rule 23(g)\nSince the court has determined that Plaintiffs have met Rule 23’s requirements\nfor class certification, the court must appoint class counsel.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g). \nOn or before April 11, 2011, any counsel who wishes to serve as class counsel shall\nfile the requisite motions and documentation to support his/her request. \nIV. Conclusion\nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification (Docket # 72) is ALLOWED, subject to\nlimitation by time.  A class of “[a]ll African-American borrowers who obtained a\nmortgage loan from one of the Defendants” is hereby certified.\n17\n\n          March 21, 2011                                          /s/Rya W.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\nCIVIL ACTION NO. 08-10157-RWZ\nCECIL BARRETT, JR., et al. \nv.\nOPTION ONE MORTGAGE CORPORATION\nand H&R BLOCK MORTGAGE CORPORATION\nn/k/a OPTION ONE MORTGAGE SERVICES, INC.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nSeptember 18, 2012\nZOBEL, D.J.\nOn March 21, 2011, the court issued an order certifying a plaintiff class in this\naction to include all African-American borrowers who obtained a mortgage loan from\none of the defendants (collectively, “Option One”) within a certain period of time.1\nDocket # 103. Three months later, the Supreme Court decided Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011). Now pending before the court is Option One’s motion to\ndecertify the class in light of that case.\nI.  Background\nThe factual background of this case is detailed in the certification order. Briefly,\n1The certification order left unresolved the beginning and end of the class\nperiod. Given the court’s resolution of the present motion, it is unnecessary to clarify\nthe former class period, and plaintiffs’ motion for clarification (Docket # 11) is denied as\nmoot.\n\nplaintiffs are a number of African-American individuals who obtained home mortgage\nloans from Option One through mortgage brokers. They allege that defendants’ loan\npricing policy violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f\n(“ECOA”), and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”), by giving\nauthorized brokers the discretion to impose additional charges unrelated to a\nborrower’s creditworthiness. Plaintiffs claim this policy had a disparate impact on\nAfrican-American borrowers by resulting in higher mortgage rates for African-American\nborrowers than similarly situated white borrowers.\nAccording to plaintiffs, Option One’s loan pricing consisted of a fixed and ap\ndiscretionary component. When a proposed borrower applied for a new loan, Option\nOne first calculated a fixed “par rate” for that borrower. The par rate was based on\nobjective criteria of creditworthiness, such as the borrower’s credit score and the value\nof the property to be mortgaged. That fixed component is not at issue. However, Option\nOne also included a discretionary component in its credit pricing system. Specifically, it\nauthorized its brokers to set interest rates higher than the par rate and to charge loan\norigination and processing fees. These higher rates and additional fees were left to the\nindividual brokers’ subjective discretion; Option One only set a maximum markup for\nthe par rate. Brokers were paid more for loans that yielded higher rates and thus cost\nconsumers more.\nPlaintiffs argue that Option One’s policy of granting brokers discretion to set\nhigher rates had an adverse effect on African-American borrowers, because on\naverage Option One’s brokers assessed higher discretionary charges against African-\n2\n\nAmerican borrowers than against similarly situated white borrowers. Plaintiffs do not\nclaim that Option One’s policy was intended to discriminate against African-Americans;\ninstead, they bring their claims under a disparate impact theory, which challenges\n“practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact\nfall more harshly on one group than another.” Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States,\n431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977).\nII.  Legal Standard\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2), a class action may only proceed\nif “there are questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2); see\nalso Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2550-51. This requirement is generally known as\n“commonality.” Members of the class need not share every fact in common or present\nidentical legal issues; however, they must share “a sufficient constellation of legal\nissues [that] binds class members together.” Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,\n208 F.3d 288, 296 (1st Cir. 2000).   If a certified class no longer meets the commonality\nrequirement, whether because of factual or legal developments, it must be decertified.\nSee O’Connor v. Boeing North American, Inc., 197 F.R.D. 404, 410-13 (C.D. Cal. 2000)\n(decertifying for failure to meet Rule 23(a)’s typicality requirement).\nDecertification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(C), which\nauthorizes the court to decertify a class “at any time before final judgment.” In re Sonus\nNetworks, Inc. Securities Litigation, 229 F.R.D. 339, 348 (D. Mass. 2005). The moving\nparty bears the burden of showing that decertification is proper. Donovan v. Philip\nMorris USA, Civil Action No. 06-12234-DJC, 2012 WL 957633, at *4 (D. Mass. Mar. 21,\n33\n\n2012).\n44\n\nIII. Analysis\nThe court’s certification order concluded that plaintiffs had demonstrated\ncommonality because the class members’ claims shared a legal and factual question:\nwhether Option One’s pricing policy, by granting brokers discretion to set higher rates,\nresulted in a disparate impact on African-American borrowers. It found plaintiffs’\ncontentions supported by the expert report of Professor Ian Ayres of Yale Law School.\nId. at 9; see Docket # 89-3, Report of Professor Ayres (“Ayres Report”). Professor\nAyres prepared a regression analysis comparing the annual percentage rate (“APR”)\npaid by white and minority borrowers for Option One wholesale loans originated from\n2001 to 2007. He found that, controlling for all legitimate risk factors that might affect\nthe cost of a loan, the APRs paid by African-American borrowers nationwide were on\naverage 0.086% higher than the APRs paid by similarly situated white borrowers. Ayres\nReport at 7 tbl.1. That is, in dollar terms, African-American borrowers on average spent\nabout $134 more per year on their mortgages than similarly situated white borrowers.\nSee id.\nUnder Wal-Mart, this showing is no longer sufficient to establish commonality.\nWal-Mart establishes that a nationwide policy of granting discretion to local units can\nonly raise a common question if the local units have a “common mode of exercising\ndiscretion.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554-55. Furthermore, Wal-Mart disapproves the\nuse of aggregate, nationwide statistics to prove a common method of exercising\ndiscretion at the local level. See id. at 2555.\nIn Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court considered a plaintiff class of “about one and a\n55\n\nhalf million plaintiffs, current and former female employees of . . . Wal-Mart.” Id. at\n2547. The plaintiffs alleged that Wal-Mart’s policy of granting local managers discretion\nover pay and promotion decisions violated Title VII under a disparate impact theory,\nbecause local managers disproportionately exercised that discretion in favor of male\nemployees. The plaintiffs further argued that a uniform “corporate culture” at Wal-Mart\nallowed bias against women to affect local managers’ exercise of discretion, “thereby\nmaking every woman at the company the victim of one common discriminatory\npractice.” Id. at 2548. In support of their argument, the plaintiffs submitted statistical\nanalyses performed at the regional and national level showing that there were\nstatistically significant disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart, and that these\ndisparities could only be explained by gender discrimination. Id. at 2555.\nThe Court ruled that the plaintiff class failed to meet the commonality\nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(2). It described Wal-Mart’s policy of allowing discretion by\nlocal managers as “just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would\nprovide the commonality needed for a class action; it is a policy against having uniform\nemployment practices.” Id. at 2554. The Court recognized that giving discretion to\nlower-level supervisors could be a policy giving rise to a disparate impact claim, but\nruled that such a claim would only be common to members of a nationwide class if the\nplaintiffs identified a “common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire\ncompany.” Id. at 2554-55. Otherwise, the Court found, “[i]n a company of Wal-Mart’s\nsize and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise\ntheir discretion in a common way without some common direction.” Id. at 2555; see also\n66\n\nid. at 2555-56 (emphasizing that plaintiffs must show a “specific employment practice”\nbeyond “the bare existence of delegated discretion”). \nFurthermore, the Court held that the plaintiffs’ statistical analyses were\ninsufficient to show a common method of exercising discretion that would satisfy Rule\n23(a)(2). Because the statistical analyses were performed on regional and national\ndata, they could not “establish the uniform, store-by-store disparity upon which the\nplaintiffs’ theory of commonality depends.” Id. at 2555. In other words, the Wal-Mart\nplaintiffs could not demonstrate commonality just by pointing to a disparate impact in\nthe nationwide average; instead, they would have to show a disparate impact in each\nstore where members of the plaintiff class worked. “Merely showing that Wal-Mart’s\npolicy of discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice.” Id. at\n2556.\nPlaintiffs’ class in this case faces the same commonality problem as did the Wal-\nMart class. Plaintiffs’ challenge Option One’s policy of granting its brokers discretion to\nset higher rates. However, they do not point to any “common mode of exercising\ndiscretion,” see id. at 2555, that was shared by all of Option One’s brokers. For\ninstance, if plaintiffs claimed that Option One’s brokers uniformly exercised their\ndiscretion by considering specific attributes that produce disparate impact—such as\n“scores on general aptitude tests or educational achievements,” id. at 2254—they\nwould state a common question justifying class treatment. But without some such claim,\nthe Supreme Court tells us, “demonstrating the invalidity of one [broker’s] use of\ndiscretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s.” Id. Because\n77\n\nplaintiffs do not claim that all of Option One’s brokers exercised their discretion in the\nsame way, they do not raise a single question common to all plaintiffs in the class.\nAs in Wal-Mart, plaintiffs here submit a statistical analysis to demonstrate that\nOption One’s policy had a disparate impact. And as in Wal-Mart, plaintiffs’ analysis\nexamines aggregate data at a national level, rather than considering each broker\nindividually. Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis shows that on average, nationwide, African-\nAmerican borrowers pay more for their loans than white borrowers. But that is no longer\nsufficient to establish commonality. Instead, under Wal-Mart, plaintiffs can only show a\ncommon question if they can show a common disparate impact at the level of each\nindividual broker, thereby raising the inference that the brokers shared a common\nmode of exercising their discretion. \nPlaintiffs make three arguments seeking to distinguish Wal-Mart and show a\ncommon question. First, they point out that each broker used the same two-stage\nprocess to set the class members’ mortgage rates. However, the first stage of this\nprocess—Option One’s par rate—is not at issue. Plaintiffs only challenge the second\nstage of the process: the brokers’ discretion to set rates higher than the par rate. And\nas discussed above, plaintiffs do not allege any specific common practice that the\nbrokers used in exercising that discretion. Second, plaintiffs note that all of the brokers’\ndecisions are recorded in the terms of a consummated loan, making it easier to\ncompare the outcomes for similarly-situated candidates. While that makes this case\nfactually different from Wal-Mart, it does not raise any common question satisfying Rule\n23(a)(2). Finally, plaintiffs argue that all of the brokers’ decisions “are explainable by a\n88\n\ncommon profit motive.” Id. That probably does not distinguish this case from Wal-Mart;\nthere is a fair argument that the Wal-Mart managers’ employment decisions can be\nsimilarly explained. The argument also cuts against plaintiffs’ primary claim that Option\nOne’s pricing policy creates a disparate impact not justified by any legitimate business\nreason, since a common profit motive is presumably a legitimate business reason. But\nmost importantly, the argument fails to show any common practice or mode of\nexercising discretion. Even if driven by a common profit motive, the brokers could have\nmade widely different decisions in pursuit of that profit motive. Cf. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct.\nat 2554 (noting that commonality fails where some managers might use sex-neutral and\nperformance-based criteria, some managers might use criteria with a disparate impact,\nand some managers might intentionally discriminate).\nOther courts in similar cases have also concluded post-Wal-Mart that classes\nlike the one certified here lack commonality. See, e.g., In re Countrywide Fin. Mortg.\nLending Practices Litig., MDL No. 1974, 2011 WL 4862174 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 13, 2011),\nperm. app. granted, No. 11-0514 (6th Cir. Mar. 7, 2012); Rodriguez v. Nat’l City Bank,\n277 F.R.D. 148 (E.D. Pa. 2011); In re Wells Fargo Residential Mortg. Lending\nDiscrimination Litig., No. 08-MD-01930 MMC, 2011 WL 3903117 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 6,\n2011).2 For the reasons set forth above, the court agrees.\nIV. Conclusion\n2Plaintiffs cite one similar case reaching the opposite conclusion. See Transcript\nof Preliminary Approval of Settlement Hearing, Harris v. Citigroup, Inc., Civil Action No.\n08-10147-MLW (D. Mass. Feb. 15, 2012). However, that decision arose in the context\nof a settlement hearing, and the parties did not vigorously debate whether certification\nwas proper. See id. at 18-19, 30-31. The ruling in that case was issued from the bench.\nId. at 29-31. \n99\n\nDefendants’ Motion to Decertify Class (Docket # 112) is ALLOWED.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the class be and hereby is decertified.     \n     September 18, 2012                                         /s/Rya W.

Bastien \nJacqueline Grissett, Craig Grissett,  Steven Parham, Betty and Edward Hoffman, Doris Murray, \nJoslyn Day and Keisha Chavers (collectively “Plaintiffs\"), on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated, by their undersigned attorneys, allege as follows: \n1.  This is a class action brought by Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and other \nsimilarly situated minority homeowners, against Option One Mortgage Corporation and H&R \nBlock Mortgage Corp. (collectively \"Defendants\"), under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 \nU.S.C. § 1691, et seq. (“ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. Plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 2 of 41\nseek remedies for themselves and the Class (defined in ¶126, below) for the discriminatory \neffects of the Defendants' home financing policies and practices. \n2.  As described below, the Defendants have established a specific, identifiable and \nuniform credit pricing system, a component of which, referred to herein as the Discretionary \nPricing Policy, authorizes unchecked, subjective surcharge of additional points and fees to an \notherwise objective risk-based financing rate.  In other words, after a finance rate acceptable to \nthe Defendants is determined by objective criteria (e.g., the individual’s credit history, credit \nscore, debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratios), the Defendants' credit pricing policy \nauthorizes additional discretionary finance charges. These subjective, additional finance charges \nhave a widespread discriminatory impact on minority applicants for home mortgage loans, in \nviolation of ECOA and the FHA.   \n3.  The mortgage lending industry has a long history of racial discrimination, offering \nminorities products and terms that are drastically worse than those given to their similarly-\nsituated white counterparts.  Recently, the Federal Reserve Board confirmed that blacks and \nother minorities are still more likely to pay higher prices for mortgages than whites. \n4.  In 2003, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (“NCRC”) released a \nreport on credit discrimination titled, “The Broken System:  Discrimination and Unequal Access \nto Affordable Loans by Race and Age,”1 that indicated that consumers living in areas with more \nminority residents are more likely to have mortgages with interest rates higher than the \n“prevailing and competitive” rates, often because of discrimination in lending. \n                                                 \n1 This report is available at http://ncrc.org/policy/cra/documents/ncrcdiscrimstudy.pdf. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 3 of 41\n5.  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”) Data for 2006 revealed that black and \nHispanic borrowers are more likely to obtain higher-priced loans than are white borrowers.2  The \ndata indicated that black homeowners who received subprime mortgage loans were much more \nlikely to be issued a higher-rate loan than white borrowers with the same qualifications. \n6.  In a speech last year, Martin J. Gruenberg, Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation observed that “previous studies have suggested higher-priced, subprime \nlenders are more active in lower income, urban areas and that minority access to credit is \ndominated by higher cost lenders.”3 \n7.  In 2006, the Center for Responsible Lending, a non-profit research organization, \nuncovered “large and statistically significant” differences between the rates of subprime loans \noffered to blacks and whites, even when income and credit risk were taken into consideration.  \nCompared to their otherwise similarly-situated white counterparts, blacks were 31-34% more \nlikely to receive higher rate fixed-rate loans and 6-15% more likely to receive adjustable-rate \nloans.4 \n8.  Subprime loans to blacks and other minorities not only impose higher interest \nrates, they are typically laden with excessive, unreasonable and often improperly disclosed fees \nas well. See n.3. \n9.  These significant disparities are not mere coincidences.  They are the result of a \nsystematic and discriminatory policy of targeting minority borrowers for high-cost loans.  \nDefendants’ business practices include implementing and maintaining policies that discriminate \n                                                 \n2 This report is available at www.ffiec.gov./hmda. \n3 See “Remarks of Martin J. Gruenberg, Vice Chairman, FDIC; Inter-American Development \nBank,” October 18, 2006, available at \nhttp://www/fdic.gov/new/speeches/archives/2006/chairman/spoct1806.html. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 4 of 41\nagainst minorities.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to seek relief from the harms suffered as a result \nof Defendants’ practices and to enjoin Defendants from continuing its discriminatory practices. \n10.  The Defendants have established policies for retail and wholesale access to their \nloan products that subject minority financing applicants to a significantly higher likelihood of \nexposure to discretionary points and fees. These costs drive up the average cost of a mortgage \nloan made by one of the defendants to minority homeowners. \n11.  Plaintiffs seek damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, disgorgement and \nrestitution of monies disparately obtained from minority borrowers. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  Plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \nwhich confers original jurisdiction upon this Court in a civil action arising under federal law.   \n13.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(b) inasmuch as the \nunlawful discriminatory practices are alleged to have been committed in this District, Defendants \nregularly conduct business in this District, and some of the named Plaintiffs reside in this \nDistrict.  \nPARTIES \n14.

MORTGAGE LENDING IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORICALLY HAS \n   DISCRIMINATED AGAINST MINORITIES \n \n25.  Borrowers who obtain a home loan at an unnecessarily high interest rate will pay \nhundreds of dollars more each month in mortgage payments, making them more vulnerable to \nshort term economic distress that may result from job loss or medical problems.  In consequence, \nminority homeowners run higher risks of foreclosure, and will accumulate equity in their homes \nmuch more slowly than white borrowers.  While for some minority borrowers with tarnished \ncredit histories, higher-priced home loans provide the only access to the mortgage market and to \nhomeownership, many other minorities will be paying far more for their mortgages than their \ncredit histories justify. \n26.  The skyrocketing levels of foreclosures in urban areas, and minority communities \nin particular, have been tied to the growth of concentrated subprime lending in these areas.5  \nConcentrated foreclosures have a devastating impact on cities and neighborhoods.  They affect \nlocal property values, serve as a magnet for crime, and hurt a city’s property tax base.6 \n                                                 \n5 Immergluck, Dan and Geoff Smith.

While many institutions specialize in lending to either prime or subprime markets, \nthere is an important set of large lenders that are active in both markets.  These lenders utilize \ndiverse lending channels such as branch, broker and correspondent networks that allow them to \nreach a wide variety of geographic markets.  Their size also gives them the capacity to offer an \narray of products that may be appropriate for customers with different levels of credit quality. \n28.  According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University’s 2005 \nstudy called “The Dual Mortgage Market:  The Persistence of Discrimination in Mortgage \nLending,” mortgage lending discrimination today is subtle but pervasive, with minority \nconsumers continuing to have less-than-equal access to loans at the best price and on the best \nterms that their credit history, income, and other individual financial considerations merit more \nthan three decades after the enactment of national fair lending legislation. \n29.  The passage of civil rights legislation and fair lending laws in the 1960s and \n1970s brought an end to the most virulent forms of overt racial discrimination in the housing \nmarkets, but throughout the 1980s and 1990s, mortgage lenders found more subtle ways to \ndiscriminate, including maintaining offices only in white neighborhoods and engaging in \npractices such as redlining (refusing to lend on properties in predominantly minority \nneighborhoods). \n30.  After such redlining practices were challenged in the 1990s, mortgage lenders \nchanged tactics once again, making loans to minorities, but charging higher interest rates and \nloan-related fees than they charged to similarly situated white borrowers.  Loan data that \n                                                                                                                                                            \nNovember 2006.  “The Impact of Single Family Foreclosures on Neighborhood Crime.”  \nHousing Studies (21:6); and Apgar, William, Mark Duda, and Rochelle Nawrocki Gorey.  \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 8 of 41\nmortgage lenders must now compile and disclose under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAct (“HMDA”) reveals profound loan pricing disparities between minority borrowers and \nsimilarly-situated white borrowers. \n31.  The HMDA requires mortgage lenders to report information about the home loans \nthey process each year.  In 2005, lenders reported information on more than 30 million home \nloan applications pursuant to HMDA.  In 1989, Congress required lenders to begin disclosing \ninformation about mortgage borrowers’ race and ethnicity.  In 2004, concerned with potential \nracial discrimination in loan pricing and recognizing that racial or other types of discrimination \ncan occur when loan officers and mortgage brokers have latitude in setting interest rates, the \nFederal Reserve Board began requiring lenders to also report information concerning rates, \npoints, and fees, charged to borrowers on high-cost loans. \n32.  According to the Federal Reserve, both 2004 and 2005 HMDA data revealed that \n“Blacks and minority borrowers were more likely . . . to have received higher-priced loans than \nnon-Hispanic whites . . .. [which has] increased concern about the fairness of the lending \nprocess.”7   \n33.  HMDA data for 2004 reveals profound loan pricing disparities between minority \nborrowers and non-Hispanic whites even after controlling for borrowers’ gender, income, \nproperty location, and loan amount.  After accounting for those differences in the 2004 HMDA \ndata, minority borrowers were still almost twice as likely to receive a higher-rate home loan as \n                                                                                                                                                            \nFebruary 2005.

Likewise, HMDA data for 2005 shows that “for conventional home-purchase \nloans, the gross mean incidence of higher-priced lending was 54.7 percent for blacks and 17.2 \npercent for non-Hispanic whites, a difference of 37.5 percentage points.”  Avery, supra, at A159.  \nThe situation is similar for refinancing, where there is a difference of 28.3 percentage points \nbetween blacks and non-Hispanic whites.  Id. at A124, A159. \n35.  The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) \nreleased a report entitled “The High Cost of Credit: Disparities in High-priced Refinanced Loans \nto Minority Homeowners in 125 American Cities,” dated September 27, 2005, that found that \n“[i]n every metropolitan area where at least 50 refinances were made to African-American \nhomeowners, African-Americans were more likely to receive a high-cost loan than White \nhomeowners.” \n36.  The study found that, nationally, black home purchasers were 2.7 times more \nlikely and Hispanics were 2.3 times more likely than white borrowers to be issued a problematic, \nsubprime loan.  Additionally, the ACORN study, available at www.acorn.org, found that \nnationally, for refinance loans, African Americans were 1.8 times more likely and Hispanics \nwere 1.4 times more likely than white borrowers to be issued a problematic, subprime loan. \n                                                 \n8 This is available at http://www.responsiblelending.org/pdfs/Testimony-Ernst061306.pdf \n9 This speech is available at \nhttp://www.fdic.gov/news/news/speeches/archives/2006/chairman/spoct1806.html. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 10 of 41\n37.  Differences in economic status are not to blame.  These racial disparities were \nfound to persist even among borrowers of the same income level.  The ACORN study found that, \namong upper-income purchasers (defined as persons with incomes 120% or greater than the area \nmedian income for their metropolitan area), African Americans were 3.3 times more likely and \nHispanics were 3 times more likely than similarly-situated whites to be issued a high-cost, \nsubprime loan.  Further, the ACORN study found that, with respect to refinance loans, among \nupper-income borrowers, African Americans and Hispanics were 1.7 times more likely than \nsimilarly-situated whites to be issued a high-cost, subprime loan. \n38.  While some borrowers in the subprime market are genuine credit risks, minority \nborrowers have been preyed upon by mortgage lenders and illegally steered into subprime loans.  \nDefendants have engaged in this discriminatory lending by refusing to offer minority borrowers \nthe prime loans offered to similarly-qualified white borrowers. \n39.  Studies by Freddie Mac and Standard & Poor’s have found that 20% to 30% of \nborrowers who receive subprime mortgages could have qualified for traditional mortgages at the \nlower rates offered by banks to prime borrowers.  This seriously disadvantages the borrower by \neffectively diluting the equity of the property, placing the borrower in jeopardy of default, and \nforcing the borrower to spend years paying off additional loan balances without developing any \nequity in their home. \n40.  Further, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found that in \nneighborhoods where at least 80 percent of the population is African American, borrowers were \n2.2 times as likely as borrowers in the nation as a whole to refinance with a subprime lender.  \n  10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 11 of 41\nHigher-income borrowers living in predominately blacks neighborhoods are twice as likely as \nlower-income white borrowers to have subprime loans.10 \n41.  The predatory lending practices of the Defendants and other mortgage lenders \nlead to dire financial consequences for borrowers.  Earlier this year, over eighty consumer groups \nwrote to federal banking agencies about a particular type of subprime loan, 2/28 the adjustable \nrate mortgage (“2/28 ARM”).  A 2/28 ARM typically contains an average built-in “shock \npayment” increase of 29%, even if interest rates remain unchanged.  Fitch Ratings reports that \nthe actual payment shock may be as high as 48%.  The majority of subprime loans made to \nminorities had these adjustable rates.  The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that 2.2 \nmillion such subprime loans have ended or will end in foreclosure, a rate of 19%.  \n42.  Each named Plaintiff has a 2/28 ARM. \n43.  The Center for Responsible Lending published a study in December 2006 on the \neffects of foreclosure.11  The report states that the costs of subprime foreclosures fall heavily on \nAfrican American and Hispanic homeowners, since subprime mortgages are disproportionately \nmade in communities of color.  HMDA data shows that over half of loans to black borrowers are \nhigher-cost loans, which, by definition, are a proxy for subprime loans.  For Hispanic \nhomeowners, the portion of higher-cost loans is also very high, at four in ten.  This data implies \nthat subprime foreclosures will affect eight percent of recent Hispanic borrowers and 10 percent \nof recent blacks borrowers.  By comparison, subprime foreclosures will likely occur among only \nabout four percent of recent white borrowers. \n                                                 \n10 See “All Other Things Being Equal:  A Paired Testing Study of Mortgage Lending \nInstitutions,” 2002, available at www.huduser.org. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 12 of 41\n44.  The Center for Responsible Lending released an additional study in November, \n200712 that explains how when a home goes into foreclosure, the negative effects extend beyond \nindividual families losing their homes to surrounding neighbors and the wider community.  The \n2007 study further reports that a foreclosure on a home lowered the price of other nearby single-\nfamily homes, on average, by 0.9 percent.  That impact was even higher in lower-income \nneighborhoods, where each foreclosure dropped home values by an average of 1.44 percent.  The \nstudy notes that communities of color will be especially harmed, since these communities receive \na disproportionate share of subprime home loans. \n45.  The 2007 study projects that, nationally, foreclosures on subprime home loans \noriginated in 2005 and 2006 will have numerous impacts on the neighborhoods and communities \nin which they occur.  For instance, the study predicts that 44.5 million neighboring homes will \nexperience devaluation because of subprime foreclosures that take place nearby, and the total \ndecline in house values and tax base from nearby foreclosure will be about $223 billion.  \nHomeowners living near foreclosed properties will see their property values decrease $5,000 on \naverage.  \n46.  A growing number of research studies and investigations show that significant \nracial disparities still exist.13   \n                                                                                                                                                            \n11 See “Losing Ground:  Foreclosures in the Subprime Market and Their Cost to Homeowners.”  \nDecember 2006, available at www.responsiblelending.org. \n12 See “Subprime Spillover:  Foreclosures Cost Neighbors $223 Billion; 44.5 Million Homes \nLost $5,000 on Average.”  Center for Responsible Lending, available at \nwww.responsiblelending.org. \n13 California Reinvestment Coalition, et al., “Paying More for the American Dream: A Multi-\nState Analysis of Higher Cost Home Purchase Lending” (March 2007) \n(http://www.nedap.org/pressroom/documents/2007_Report-2005_HMDA.pdf); Ross, “The \n  12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 13 of 41\n47.  Moreover, and importantly, research studies have suggested that borrowers’ credit \nprofiles cannot fully explain why some borrowers, and not others, are saddled with higher cost \nloans.  Researchers have raised “doubts that risk can adequately explain racial differences” in \nhigh-cost loans.14 In other words, evidence “suggests that weak borrower credit profiles do not \nfully explain why some borrowers get stuck with higher-cost home loans.”15 \nB.  THE DEFENDANTS’ DISCRETIONARY PRICING POLICY CONTINUES THE \nPERVASIVE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MINORITIES IN MORTGAGE \nLENDING \n \n48.  Option One was one of the largest subprime mortgage-lending companies in the \nUnited States.   Option One publicly promoted its home financing expertise by means of \nnationwide advertising campaigns.  In its advertisements, Option One solicited persons to apply \nfor financing with Option One either in one of its branch offices or through one of the mortgage \nbrokers whom Option One had authorized to accept applications on its behalf.    \n49.   H&R Block made home-mortgage loans directly to consumers through its \nsubsidiary, H&R Block Mortgage. \n50.  Option One made home-mortgage loans - the majority of which were subprime \nloans - that were arranged by its loan officers and/or its network of mortgage brokers.  Those \nloans were made in reliance on Option One’s credit-granting policies and with the participation \nof H&R Block and H&R Block Mortgage Corp.   \n                                                                                                                                                            \nContinuing Practice and Impact of Discrimination” (Revised July 2006) (Univ. of Connecticut, \nWorking Paper 2005-19R) (http://www.econ.uconn.edu/working/2005-19r.pdf). \n14 Bradford, Center for Community Change, “Risk or Race?

Due to H&R Block’s policies as to where to place its offices and how to market \nits products, minority borrowers were more likely than white borrowers to apply for credit from \nH&R Block through its sub-prime subsidiary Option One, or from an Option One authorized \nbroker.   \n52.  Even after controlling for differences in credit risk, because of the Discretionary \nPricing Policy, loans obtained from Option One or Option One’s network of brokers are more \nexpensive, on average, than loans obtained directly from H&R Block or H&R Block Mortgage.   \n53.  H&R Block and H&R Block Mortgage Corp., in the ordinary course of its \nbusiness, regularly participates in credit decisions made by Option One, including setting the \nterms of credit available in transactions originated by Option One.  H&R Block, H&R Block \nMortgage Corp. and Option One jointly established the Discretionary Pricing Policy at issue in \nthis case. \n54.  H&R Block and H&R Block Mortgage Corp. participated in the decisions to grant \ncredit to the Plaintiffs including, without limitation, by making the Discretionary Pricing Policy \napplicable to their loans. \n55.  Based on the latest available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”) data \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development, minority homeowners who borrowed \nfrom Option One were more likely than whites to have received a high-APR loan. \n56.  A high-APR loan is a loan whose APR is at least three percentage points higher \nthan the interest rate on U.S. Treasury securities of the same maturity, at the time the loan was \nmade.  \n  14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 15 of 41\n57.  While credit differences may explain some part of the disparities in rate and \nterms, the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy accounts for a significant portion of the \ndisparity. \n58.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy is unrelated to a borrower’s \nobjective credit characteristics such as credit history, credit score, debt-to-income ratio and loan-\nto-value ratios and results in purely subjective charges that affect the rate otherwise available to \nborrowers. \n59.  Option One provided its loan officers and authorized mortgage brokers with \nsubstantial information about its loan programs, rates and credit criteria, as well as its policies for \ncompensating its loan officers and mortgage brokers who arranged business for it. \n60.  Option One authorized certain mortgage brokers to accept applications on its \nbehalf, to quote financing rates and terms (within the limitations set by H&R Block), to inform \ncredit applicants of Option One’s financing options and to originate finance transactions using \nH&R Block’s forms, in accordance with its policies.  \n61.  Option One provided its loan officers and brokers with credit applications, loan \ncontracts and other required financing forms, as well as instructions on filling out such \ndocuments necessary to complete home mortgage transactions.   \n62.  After a customer provided credit information to one of Option One’s loan officers \nor brokers, Option One computed a financing rate through an objective credit analysis that, in \ngeneral, discerned the creditworthiness of the customer. \n63.  These credit analyses considered numerous risk-related variables of \ncreditworthiness, including credit bureau histories, payment amounts, debt ratio, bankruptcies, \n  15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 16 of 41\nautomobile repossessions, charge-offs, prior foreclosures, payment histories, credit score, debt-\nto-income ratios, loan-to-value ratios and other risk-related attributes or variables.  On \ninformation and belief, Option One used these variables to determine a “mortgage score” for \neach credit applicant. \n64.  Based on these objective risk-related variables and the resulting mortgage score, \nOption One derived a risk-based financing rate at which it would provide a home mortgage, \noften called the “Par Rate.”  Alternatively, experienced Option One loan officers and brokers \nestimated the risk-related Par Rate by referring to the applicant’s credit bureau determined credit \nscore. \n65.  Although Option One’s initial analysis applied objective criteria to calculate this \nrisk-related Par Rate, Option One then authorized a subjective component in its credit pricing \nsystem —the Discretionary Pricing Policy — to impose additional non-risk charges. On \ninformation and belief, the applicable Par Rates and authorized discretionary charges were \ncommunicated by Option One to its loan officers and brokers via regularly published “rate \nsheets.” On information and belief, such rate sheets were published by Option One via intranet \nand internet. \n66.  The discretionary charges are paid by the customer as a component of the total \nfinance charge (the “Contract APR”), without the homeowner knowing that a portion of their \ncontract APR was a non-risk-related charge. \n67.  Loan officers and brokers had discretion, within the limits set by the Defendants, \nto impose discretionary mark-ups as additional points in interest – “a rate mark-up”, or as points \n  16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 17 of 41\nand fees on the loan.  When there was a rate mark-up, the Defendants received additional \nincome.   \n68.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, by design, caused persons with \nidentical or similar credit scores to pay different amounts for the cost of credit.  As a result of \nusing a subjective pricing component that is designed to charge persons with the same credit \nprofiles different amounts of finance charge, the objective qualities of the initial credit analysis \nused to calculate the Par Rate are undermined and the potential for race bias became inherent in \nthe transaction.  \n69.  The Discretionary Pricing Policy, although facially neutral (insofar as the \nDefendants use the same or effectively the same policy for all credit applicants), had a \ndisproportionately adverse effect on minorities compared to similarly situated whites in that \nminorities paid disparately more discretionary charges (both in frequency and amount) than \nsimilarly situated whites.  Statistical analysis of discretionary charges imposed on minority and \nwhite customers of other mortgage companies that use credit pricing systems structured like that \nof Option One has revealed that minorities, after controlling for credit risk, are substantially \nmore likely than similarly situated whites to pay such charges. \n70.    Loan officers and brokers are agents of Option One for the purpose of setting \ncredit price, which always was set based on the Defendants’ policy.   \n71.  The disparate impact suffered by minorities is a direct result of the Defendants’ \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy in that the Defendants designed, disseminated, controlled, \nimplemented and profited from the Discretionary Pricing Policy creating the disparate impact. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 18 of 41\n72.  The Defendants have a non-delegable duty to ensure that their mortgage financing \nstructure and policies do not have a disparate impact on legally protected classes, such as \nminorities.  Despite having such a non-delegable duty, the Defendants chose to use, a \ncommission-driven, subjective pricing policy that they knew or should have known had a \nsignificant and pervasive adverse impact on minority homeowners.  \n73.  The disparities between the terms of the Defendants’ transactions involving \nminority homeowners and the terms involving whites homeowners cannot be a product of chance \nand cannot be explained by factors unrelated to race, but, instead, are the direct causal result of \nthe use of the discriminatory Discretionary Pricing Policy. \n74.  There are no legitimate business reasons justifying the Defendants’ discriminatory \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy that could not be achieved by a policy that has no discriminatory \nimpact or a greatly reduced discriminatory impact. \nC.  THE DEFENDANTS’ DISCRETIONARY PRICING POLICY DISCRIMINATED \nAGAINST PLAINTIFFS \n \nFacts Relating To The Barretts \n75.

While long suspected, mortgage lending discrimination has only recently been \ndisclosed and quantified.  It has only been in the last few years that mortgage lenders have been \nrequired to submit details of their subprime home loans under the Home Mortgage Disclosure \n  31 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 32 of 41\nAct.  The groups that have studied predatory lending and the mortgage market have uncovered \nincredible racial disparities in the types of mortgages offered. \n176.  The causes of action alleged herein accrued upon discovery of the discriminatory \nimpact of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class did \nnot discover and could not have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence the \nfactual bases of those claims.  Indeed, the data forming the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims only \nrecently was released and analyzed in a comprehensive manner.  Moreover, because the \nDefendants knowingly and actively concealed the facts alleged herein, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave been kept ignorant of vital information essential to the pursuit of these claims, without any \nfault or lack of diligence on their part. \n177.  Commission-driven, discretionary pricing systems, such as those used in the \nmortgage industry and structurally similar to the system utilized by the Defendants, have been \nfound to produce significant discriminatory effects.  Knowledge concerning the significant and \npervasive discriminatory impact of such commission-driven, discretionary credit pricing systems \nhas been widely circulated within the financing industry for several years, as a result of \nnumerous actions by the United States Department of Justice and federal regulatory agencies. \nSee, Facts, section A supra. Thus, the Defendants knew or should have known that their credit \npricing system causes minority homeowners to pay more for mortgage financing than the \namounts paid by white customers with identical or effectively identical credit scores. \n178.  Despite the fact that the Defendants knew or should have known of the \ndiscriminatory effect of their Discretionary Pricing Policy, none of the loan documents inform \n  32 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 33 of 41\nthe customer that its finance rates ultimately are subjective and not based solely on risk-related \ncharacteristics. \n179.  The Defendants were and are under a continuous non-delegable duty to disclose \nto the Plaintiffs and Class material information regarding their loans.  The fact that certain loan \nterms are subjective and discretionary is information a reasonable borrower would consider \nimportant when deciding whether to accept the loan and on what terms.  The fact that the \nsubjective and discretionary components result in a disparate impact on minority is also \ninformation a reasonable minority borrower would consider important. \n180.  The Defendants failed to disclose this information, however, and Plaintiffs and \nClass Members reasonably relied upon the Defendants’ representation that terms of their loans \nwould be based on their creditworthiness.  The Defendants’ financing documents falsely fostered \nthe image that the Defendants offer competitive rates that objectively are set.  However, the \nDefendants never disclosed to its credit applicants the fact that: (a) its credit rates are subjective \nand can vary significantly among persons with identical credit profiles; and (b) it had authorized \nand provided a financial incentive to mortgage brokers to subjectively increase the credit rate \nabove the rate otherwise available to the homeowner. \n181.  Due to the inherent nature of the Defendants’ undisclosed Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy and due to the Defendants’ deception and concealment, the Defendants’ minority \ncustomers had no way of knowing or suspecting: (a) the existence of the Defendants’ subjective \ncredit pricing policy; (b) that they were charged additional subjective credit charges;  (c) that \nthey were charged a disproportionately greater amount for their cost of credit than similarly \nsituated white persons, and or (d) that any part of the loan price was negotiable.  Thus, the \n  33 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 34 of 41\nDefendants are estopped from relying on any statutes of limitation in their defenses of this \naction. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n182.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation above as if set forth herein in full. \n183.  Plaintiffs sue on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of persons under Rules \n23(a) and (b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n184.  This class action is brought pursuant to ECOA and the FHA by the individual \nnamed Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all minority consumers (the “Class”) who obtained \nan  Option One home mortgage loan in the United States between January 1, 2001 and the date \nof judgment in this action (the “Class Period”) and who were subject to the Defendants’ \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy pursuant to which they paid discretionary points, fees or interest \nmark-ups in connection with their loan. The term “minority” refers to blacks and Hispanics as \ndefined by federal law.  \n185.  The phrase \"Discretionary Pricing Policy\" refers to the Defendants’ policy of \nauthorizing its loan officers and brokers to impose subjective, discretionary charges and interest \nmark-ups that are included in the finance charge loans they originate.  \n186.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact size or identities of the proposed Class, since \nsuch information is in the exclusive control of the Defendants.  Plaintiffs believe that the Class \nencompasses many thousands or tens of thousands of individuals who are dispersed \ngeographically throughout the United States.  Therefore, the proposed class is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 35 of 41\n187.  All members of the Class have been subject to and affected by the same \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy.  There are questions of law and fact that are common to the Class, \nand predominate over any questions affecting only individual members of the Class.  These \nquestions include, but are not limited to the following: \na.  the nature, scope and operations of  Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy; \nb.  whether H&R Block, Inc., H&R Block Bank,  Option One, and H&R \nBlock Mortgage are creditors under the ECOA because, for example, in the \nordinary course of its business they participate in the decision as to whether or not \nto extend credit to consumers; \nc.  whether  the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy is a facially neutral \ncredit pricing system that has effected racial discrimination in violation of ECOA; \nd.  whether there are statistically significant disparities between the amount of \nthe discretionary charges  imposed on minority persons and the amount of the \ndiscretionary charges imposed on white persons that are unrelated to \ncreditworthiness; \ne.  whether any legitimate business reason for the Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy can be  achieved by a credit pricing system less discriminatory in its \nimpact;  \nf.  whether the Court can enter declaratory and injunctive relief;  \ng.  the proper measure of actual and/or punitive damages and/or restitution; \nand  \n  35 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 36 of 41\nh.  the proper measure of disgorgement and/or other relief for unjust \nenrichment.  \n188.  The claims of the individual named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class \nand do not conflict with the interests of any other members of the Class in that both the Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class were subject to the same Discretionary Pricing Policy that \ndisproportionately has affected minority homeowners. \n189.  The individual named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests \nof the Class. They are committed to the vigorous prosecution of the Class’ claims and have \nretained attorneys who are qualified to pursue this litigation and have experience in class actions \n– in particular, consumer protection and discrimination actions. \n190.  A class action is superior to other methods for the fast and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy.  A class action regarding the issues in this case does not create any problems \nof manageability. \n191.  In the alternative, Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the Class as a whole.  \nCOUNT I \nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT  \n \n192.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation above as if set forth herein in full. \n193.  The Defendants are creditors as defined in ECOA, and in the ordinary course of \nits business, participated in the decision of whether or not to extend credit to the Plaintiffs, the \nproposed Class representatives herein, and all prospective Class members.   \n  36 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 37 of 41\n194.  The Defendants designed, disseminated, controlled, implemented and profited \nfrom the discriminatory policy and practice alleged herein — the Discretionary Pricing Policy —\nwhich has had a disparate economic impact on minorities compared to similarly situated whites. \n195.  All actions taken by Option One’s loan officers and authorized brokers were in \naccordance with the specific authority granted to them by Option One and were in furtherance of \nthe Defendants’ policies and practices. \n196.  As a result of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, the Defendants have \ncollected more in finance charges from minority borrowers than from similarly situated white \npersons, for reasons unrelated to credit risk. \n197.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy violates the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act. \n198.  Plaintiffs and prospective class members are aggrieved persons as defined in \nECOA by virtue of having been subject to the Defendants’ discriminatory, Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy.  \nCOUNT II \nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT  \n \n199.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation above as if set forth herein in full. \n200.  The Defendants engaged in residential real estate-related transactions with respect \nto the Plaintiffs, the proposed Class representatives herein, and all prospective Class members.   \n201.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy has resulted in discrimination with \nrespect to the Plaintiffs, the proposed Class representatives herein, and all prospective  members \nof the Class. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 57   Filed 07/09/09   Page 38 of 41\n202.  As a result of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, the Defendants have \ncollected more in finance charges from minorities than from similarly situated white persons, for \nreasons unrelated to credit risk. \n203.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy violates the Fair Housing Act and \nconstitutes actionable discrimination on the basis of race. \n204.  Plaintiffs and the Class are aggrieved persons as defined in FHA by virtue of \nhaving been subject to the Defendants’ discriminatory, Discretionary Pricing Policy.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \n  a.

BASTIEN, JACQUELINE GRISSETT, CRAIG GRISSETT, and\nSTEVEN PARHAM on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\nv.\nH&R BLOCK, INC., OPTION ONE MORTGAGE CORPORATION and \nH&R BLOCK MORTGAGE CORPORATION N/K/A \nOPTION ONE MORTGAGE SERVICES, INC.1\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nFebruary 6, 2009\nZOBEL, D.J.\nDefendants’ motions to dismiss are before the court.  For the reasons discussed\nbelow, the motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is\ndenied, but H&R Block, Inc.’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) is allowed.\nI. Background\nPlaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves and other\nsimilarly situated minority homeowners against H&R Block, Inc. (“H&R Block”) and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries, Option One Mortgage Corporation (“Option One”) and H&R\nBlock Mortgage Corporation (“H&R Block Mortgage”).  Plaintiffs allege that defendants’\n“Discretionary Pricing Policy” has a widespread discriminatory impact on minority\napplicants for home mortgage loans in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15\n1 H&R Block Bank, a Federal Savings Bank, Member FDIC, was named as a\ndefendant but has since been voluntarily dismissed from the action.\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 2 of 19\nU.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f (“ECOA”), and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619\n(“FHA”).\nPlaintiffs allege that H&R Block “offered a full range of home mortgage services\nthrough its direct and indirect subsidiaries” Option One and H&R Block Mortgage.  (Am.\nCompl. (Docket # 4) ¶ 18.)  Option One was “primarily a wholesale mortgage lender\nand offered its services through its branches and a national network of mortgage\nbrokers,” while H&R Block Mortgage “was a retail mortgage lender making direct-to-\nconsumer loans nationwide.”  (Id. ¶¶ 21-22.)2  According to plaintiffs, when a proposed\nborrower applied for a loan Option One first computed a risk-based financing rate (the\n“Par Rate”) based on objective criteria of creditworthiness.  However, Option One then\nauthorized a subjective component in its credit pricing system (the “Discretionary\nPricing Policy”) to impose additional charges unrelated to the borrower’s\ncreditworthiness.  H&R Block and H&R Block Mortgage played a role by jointly\nestablishing the Discretionary Pricing Policy and participating in the decisions to grant\ncredit to borrowers, including by applying the Discretionary Pricing Policy.  (Id. ¶¶ 53-\n54.)\nPlaintiffs allege that “the Discretionary Pricing Policy, by design, caused persons\nwith identical or similar credit scores to pay different amounts for the cost of credit.” \n(Id. ¶ 68.)  Although facially neutral, the policy had a disproportionately adverse effect\non minorities, in that minorities paid more discretionary charges on their home loans\nthan similarly situated white borrowers.\n2 Both entities ceased originating loans in 2007.\n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 3 of 19\nOption One and H&R Block Mortgage have collectively moved to dismiss the\ncomplaint entirely for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).  H&R Block moves separately for dismissal based on lack of personal\njurisdiction and insufficient service of process.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(5).\nII. The Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)\nIn deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept all\nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true.  Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 5\n(1st Cir. 2007).  A complaint must allege “a plausible entitlement to relief” in order to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss, and “while a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\ndoes not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds\nof his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic\nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Thomas v. Rhode Island,\n542 F.3d 944, 948 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-65 (2007)).  \nDefendants proffer four arguments in support of their motion to dismiss, which\nthe court addresses sequentially.\nA. Disparate Impact Claims under the ECOA and FHA\nThe FHA prohibits\nany person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential\nreal estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person ni  making\navailable  such a  transaction,  or i n  the terms  or condi tions  of such a\ntransaction, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status,\nor national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 3605(a).  The ECOA prohibits any creditor from discriminating against a\n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 4 of 19\nqualified applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction “on the basis of\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age.”  15 U.S.C.\n§ 1691(a)(1).  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has adopted “the consensus\namong the circuits” and ruled that disparate impact claims are permissible under the\nFHA.  See Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 2000); Macone v.\nTown of Wakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).  Although the First Circuit has not\ndecided whether disparate impact claims are permissible under the ECOA, the circuit\ncourts and many district courts that have decided the issue have uniformly concluded\nthat they are.  See, e.g., Miller v. Am. Express Co., 688 F.2d 1235, 1239-40 (9th Cir.\n1982); Bhandari v. First Nat’l Bank of Commerce, 808 F.3d 1082, 1101 (5th Cir. 1987),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds, 492 U.S. 901 (1989); Golden v. City of\nColumbus, 404 F.3d 950, 963 n.11 (6th Cir. 2005) (dictum); Miller v. Countrywide Bank,\nN.A., 571 F. Supp. 2d 251 (D. Mass. 2008).  Indeed, defendants cite no authority which\nconcludes that the ECOA does not permit disparate impact claims.\nNonetheless, defendants argue that the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith v.\nCity of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228 (2005), when read in tandem with its earlier decisions in\nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), and Jackson v. Birmingham Board of\nEducation, 544 U.S. 167 (2005), compels the conclusion that disparate impact claims\nare not cognizable under either the ECOA or the FHA because neither statute contains\nlanguage focusing on the “effects of the action . . . rather than the motivation for the\naction.”  (Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (Docket # 14), 6 (quoting Smith, 544\nU.S. at 235-36).)  I have previously considered and rejected this argument.  See\n4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 5 of 19\nAlleyne v. Flagstar Bank, No. 07-cv-12128-RWZ, slip op. at 4-7 (D. Mass. Sept. 12,\n2008).  In Alleyne, I noted that Smith – which held that the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act (“ADEA”) authorizes claims of age discrimination based on disparate\nimpact – does not require adverse effects language as a necessary prerequisite to\nallowing disparate impact liability.  Rather, it “was decided on the basis of a number of\ncanons of statutory interpretation and does not define a unique textual interpretation\nstandard sufficient to invalidate First Circuit precedent on the FHA.”  Id. at 6-7.3  I also\nnoted that the agency charged with interpreting the ECOA, the Federal Reserve Board\n(“FRB”), has concluded that Congress intended to allow disparate impact claims under\nthat statute, and “while application of the plurality’s textual interpretation of the ADEA in\nSmith would support the conclusion that the ECOA does not allow discriminatory impact\nclaims, its reliance on agency interpretation would suggest the opposite.  Therefore,\nSmith provides insufficient guidance to reverse the unanimous conclusions of the FRB\nand the courts that have considered the issue.”  Id. at 5, 7.  I adhere to my prior ruling\non this issue.\nB. Failure to Adequately Plead a Disparate Impact Claim\nDefendants argue that “[d]iscrimination claims based on a defendant’s alleged\nsubjective or discretionary decision-making process require particularized identification\n3 See also Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237-38 (1997) (discouraging lower\ncourts from concluding that “more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an\nearlier precedent” and “reaffirm[ing] that if a precedent of this Court has direct\napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of\ndecisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving\nto this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions”) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 6 of 19\nof specific practices that allegedly result in a disparate impact,” and plaintiffs’ general\nallegations of a “Discretionary Pricing Policy” fall short of this standard.  (Docket # 14,\n3.)4  \nIn Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 990-91 (1988), the\nSupreme Court held that “subjective or discriminatory . . . practices may be analyzed\nunder the disparate impact approach,” reasoning that “[i]f an employer’s undisciplined\nsystem of subjective decisionmaking has precisely the same effects as a system\npervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination, it is difficult to see why Title VII’s\nproscription against discriminatory actions should not apply.”  The Court noted that to\nestablish a prima facie case a plaintiff must “begin by identifying the specific\nemployment practice that is challenged,” and is “responsible for isolating and\nidentifying the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any\nobserved statistical disparities.”  Id. at 994.  The Court reiterated this requirement in\nWards Cove, noting that “a plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a\nspecific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate impact under\nattack.”  \nWards Cove Packing Co., Inc. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 657 (1989), superseded in part\nby statute, Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, as recognized\nin Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 251 n.3 (1994).  Finally, in Smith, the\n4 Defendants also briefly assert that the complaint fails to allege a causal\nconnection between the challenged conduct and the statistical disparities, but fail to\nexpound on this argument.  (See Docket # 14, 9.)  Accordingly, I do not consider it. \nSee United States v. Van Anh, 523 F. 3d 43, 53 n.8 (1st Cir. 2008) (arguments not\nsufficiently developed are deemed waived).\n6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 7 of 19\nSupreme Court rejected a disparate impact claim under the ADEA because plaintiffs\n“have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less\ngenerous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any\nspecific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on\nolder workers.”  Smith, 544 U.S. at 241.  Relying on Wards Cove, Watson and Smith,\ndefendants argue that plaintiffs’ claim must fail because it is a challenge to their\n“overall loan origination process that allegedly includes both objective and subjective\nfactors, the aggregate result of which is alleged to have a disparate impact on minority\nloan applicants.”  (Docket # 14, 10.)  In fact, plaintiffs’ challenge is not to the “overall\nloan origination process,” but to the specific “Discretionary Pricing Policy” within that\nprocess that permitted loan officers and brokers to impose additional discretionary\ncharges unrelated to a borrower’s creditworthiness.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 36-44.) \nPlaintiffs have adequately identified the practice at issue: “establishing a par rate keyed\nto objective indicators of creditworthiness while simultaneously authorizing additional\ncharges keyed to factors unrelated to those criteria.”  Miller v. Countrywide Bank, N.A.,\n571 F. Supp. 2d 251, 257 (D. Mass. 2008).5  Cf. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1964 (noting\nthat Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) “requires only ‘a short and plain statement\nof the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’ in order to ‘give the defendant\n5 It is also noteworthy that Smith, Watson and Wards Cove were all decided in\nthe context of summary judgment or after a trial.  In all three the issue was whether the\nplaintiffs’ evidence adequately established a prima facie case of disparate impact, not\nwhether plaintiffs had adequately alleged disparate impact in their complaint.  See\nSmith, 544 U.S. at 231, 243 (challenge to summary judgment ruling); Wards Cove, 490\nU.S. at 648 (challenge to findings made after trial); Watson, 487 U.S. at 983-84 (same). \n7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 8 of 19\nfair notice of what the  . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’”) (citation\nomitted).6\nC. Statute of Limitations\nThe FHA provides that a plaintiff must file suit within two years after “the\noccurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice.”  42 U.S.C.\n§ 3613(a)(1)(A).  Actions under ECOA similarly have a two-year statute of limitations. \n15 U.S.C. § 1691e(f) (“No such action shall be brought later than two years from the\ndate of the occurrence of the violation . . . .”).  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims\nmust be dismissed to the extent they are based on alleged conduct which occurred\nmore than two years before the complaint was filed.  Plaintiffs respond that various\ntolling doctrines, including the continuing violations doctrine, the discovery rule and\nfraudulent concealment by defendants, apply to preserve claims based on conduct\nextending beyond the two-year period.\nPlaintiffs, seven minority homeowners, filed their complaint in February 2008. \nAll of the plaintiffs except two, Cecil Barrett, Jr. and Cynthia Barrett (“the Barretts”), first\nentered into loan agreements with Option One after February 2006, within the statute of\n6 I note that the complaint also contains a bare allegation that “[d]ue to H&R\nBlock’s policies as to where to place its offices and how to market its products, minority\nborrowers were more likely than white borrowers to apply for credit from H&R Block\nthrough its sub-prime subsidiary Option One, or from an Option One authorized\nbroker.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 51.)  To the extent plaintiffs intend to assert a claim of\ndisparate impact based upon unspecified H&R Block policies relating to office location\nand marketing (and it is not clear that they do), such a claim is not sufficiently pled.\n8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 9 of 19\nlimitations period.7  The Barretts purchased their home in January 2004, and\nrefinanced their home loan with Option One on two occasions, in August 2005 and April\n2006.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 77, 81.)  Defendants argue that the Barretts cannot assert\nclaims based upon the first refinancing in August 2005.\nThe Supreme Court recognized the application of the continuing violations\ndoctrine in actions brought under the FHA in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\nU.S. 363 (1982).  In Havens, the Court held that a complaint which alleges a continuing\nillegal practice, rather than isolated incidents of violative conduct, is timely so long as\nthe last occurrence of the illegal practice happened during the limitations period.  See\nid. at 380-81; see also id. at 380 (“Statutes of limitations . . . are intended to keep stale\nclaims out of the courts.  Where the challenged violation is a continuing one, the\nstaleness concern disappears.”) (internal citation omitted).  Here, plaintiffs allege a\ncontinuing illegal practice – the Discretionary Pricing Policy – and that defendants used\nthis practice both when the Barretts first refinanced their loan in August 2005 and again\nwhen they refinanced in April 2006, within the limitations period.  That is sufficient to\nrender all of the Barretts’ FHA claims timely at this stage.  See id.; accord Miller v.\nCountrywide Bank, N.A., 571 F. Supp. 2d. 251, 261-62 (D. Mass. 2008).  \nThe question of whether the continuing violations doctrine applies to ECOA\n7 Plaintiffs Jean Blanco Guerrier and Angelique Bastien purchased their home,\nwith Option One as the lender, in April 2006.  Jacqueline Grissett and Craig Grissett\nheld a home loan with a different lender and refinanced this loan with Option One in\nAugust 2006.  Plaintiff Steven Parham similarly refinanced a previous home loan\n(entered into with a different lender) with Option One in September 2006.  (Am. Compl.\n¶¶ 93, 105, 119.)\n9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 10 of 19\nclaims is less settled.  See Sanders v. USDA Rural Housing, No. 3-06-0587, 2007 WL\n2471799, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 28, 2007) (discussing ambiguity in case law). \nNonetheless, defendants do not suggest that the ECOA claims should be analyzed\ndifferently from the FHA claims, and the court cannot discern any reason why the\ncontinuing violations doctrine should not apply.  Application of the doctrine here is also\nconsistent with this circuit’s recognition of the doctrine in Title VII claims.  See Rosa v.\nPark W. Bank & Tr. Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215 (1st Cir. 2000) (“[i]n interpreting the ECOA,\nthis court looks to Title VII case law”); Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners\nLocal No. 33, 921 F.2d 396, 400-01 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying doctrine to Title VII claim). \nSee also Miller, 571 F. Supp. 2d at 261-62 (applying continuing violation doctrine to\nECOA claim); Ramirez v. GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc., No. C08-0369-THE,\n2008 WL 2051018, at *6 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2008) (same); Davis v. Gen. Motors\nAcceptance Corp., 406 F. Supp. 2d 698, 705-06 (N.D. Miss. 2005) (same).\nD. Ability to Simultaneously Pursue ECOA and FHA Claims\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs are not permitted to simultaneously pursue both\nECOA and FHA claims.  It is true that plaintiffs may only recover under one of these\ntheories.  See 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(i).  However, nothing in the statute limits them from\nproceeding under both theories, and Rule 8 permits plaintiffs to plead alternative\ntheories of liability.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d).\nAccordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is denied.\nIII. H&R Block’s Motion to Dismiss\nH&R Block moves to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 11 of 19\n12(b)(2) and 12(b)(5), asserting that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in\nMassachusetts and that it has been improperly served.  It argues that it did not\noriginate any of the mortgages at issue and is a holding company that has not\ntransacted any business in Massachusetts and has no contacts within the\nCommonwealth.\nA. Legal Standards\nPlaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction over H&R Block.  Philips v.\nPrairie Eye Ctr., 530 F.3d 22, 25 n.1 (1st Cir. 2008).  As with any other motion to\ndismiss, the court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true and construes the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Id. at 24.  The court must then “add to\nthe mix facts put forward by the defendants, to the extent that they are uncontradicted.” \nMassachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass’n, 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir.\n1998).  Under the prima facie analysis, the inquiry is “whether the plaintiff has proffered\nevidence which, if credited, is sufficient to support findings of all facts essential to\npersonal jurisdiction.”  Id. at 26.  \nAn exercise of jurisdiction must be authorized by state statute and in compliance\nwith the Constitution.  Platten v. HG Bermuda Exempted Ltd., 437 F.3d 118, 135 (1st\nCir. 2006).  The Massachusetts long-arm statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3, has\nbeen interpreted to be coextensive with the outer limits of the Constitution.  “Automatic”\nSprinkler Corp. of Am. v. Seneca Foods Corp., 280 N.E.2d 423, 424 (Mass. 1972). \nAccordingly, the state and constitutional inquiry merge.  Under circuit precedent,\nThe due process clause imposes several requirements on the exercise of\n11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 12 of 19\npersonal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants.  First, the defendant must\nhave sufficient “minimum contacts” with the state.  For specific jurisdiction,\nthe plaintiff’s claim must be related to the defendant’s contacts.  For general\njurisdiction, in which the cause of action may be unrelated to the defendant’s\ncontacts, the defendant must have continuous and systematic contacts with\nthe state.  Second, for either type of jurisdiction, the defendant’s contacts\nwith the state must be purposeful.  And third, the exercise of jurisdiction must\nbe reasonable under the circumstances.\nHarlow v. Children’s Hosp., 432 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs assert that there\nis both general and specific jurisdiction over H&R Block.  “The critical factor in the\npersonal jurisdiction calculus – both general and specific – is the existence of ‘minimum\ncontacts’ between the nonresident defendant and the forum.”  Negron-Torres v. Verizon\nCommc’ns, Inc., 478 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 2007). \nB. Specific Jurisdiction\n“A court may assert specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant ‘where\nthe cause of action arises directly out of, or relates to, the defendant’s forum-based\ncontacts.’”  Negron-Torres, 478 F.3d at 24 (quoting United Elec., Radio and Mach.\nWorkers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088-89 (1st Cir. 1992)).  \nThe First Circuit has affirmed that “the relatedness requirement is not an open door; it\nis closely read, and it requires a showing of a material connection.  This court\nsteadfastly rejects the exercise of personal jurisdiction whenever the connection\nbetween the cause of action and the defendant’s forum-state contacts seems\nattenuated and indirect.”  Harlow, 432 F.3d at 61 (holding that “the defendant’s in-state\nconduct must form an important, or at least material, element of proof in the plaintiff’s\ncase”) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 13 of 19\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants Option One and H&R Block Mortgage are\nwholly-owned subsidiaries of H&R Block, which is headquartered in Kansas City,\nMissouri.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 18, 21-22.)  Further, they assert that H&R Block Bank, which\n“offers a variety of residential mortgage loan products,” commenced operations in\n2006, “at which time H&R Block Inc. became a savings and loan holding company.” \n(Id. ¶ 19.)  Although the complaint sets forth a number of actions taken within the\nCommonwealth, it conflates H&R Block and H&R Block Bank by referring to them\ncollectively as “H&R Block,” and in many instances directs its allegations collectively to\n“Defendants” as a group, rendering it difficult to discern what contacts, if any, H&R\nBlock had within the Commonwealth.  For example, when plaintiffs allege that “H&R\nBlock . . . participated in the decisions to grant credit to Plaintiffs including, without\nlimitation, by making the Discretionary Pricing Policy applicable to their loans,” (id.\n¶ 54), it is unclear whether they are referring to H&R Block, H&R Block Bank, or both,\nand it is certainly unclear whether any decision by H&R Block was made in\nMassachusetts.  See Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 36 (rejecting notion that\nMassachusetts court had personal jurisdiction over defendants who decided to deny a\nMassachusetts school’s accreditation at a meeting in New York, and noting, “[w]e have\nwrestled before with this issue of whether the in-forum effects of extra-forum activities\nsuffice to constitute minimum contacts and have found in the negative”).  Although the\ncourt must treat specific facts affirmatively alleged by plaintiffs as true, it need not credit\nconclusory allegations.  Id. at 34.  \nIn any event, “[t]he prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction must be based\n13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 14 of 19\non evidence of specific facts set forth in the record.  In other words, the plaintiff must go\nbeyond the pleadings and make affirmative proof.”  Negron-Torres, 478 F.3d at 23\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence\nsuggesting that H&R Block participated in formulating or approving the Discretionary\nPricing Policy, or had other forum-based activities related to their claims.  Indeed, H&R\nBlock directly contradicts plaintiffs’ conclusory allegations about its involvement.  The\nVice President and Secretary of H&R Block avers that it does not set financing rates\nand terms for the origination of mortgages or finance transactions, does not participate\nin credit decisions made by Option One, and was not involved in the origination of any\nof plaintiffs’ mortgages.  (Aff. of Bret G. Wilson (“Wilson Aff.”) (Docket # 12, Ex. A)\n¶¶ 22-25.)  Mr. Wilson further avers that H&R Block: (1) is a holding company that is\nauthorized to transact business only in Missouri; (2) does not pay the salaries of any\nemployees of its subsidiaries; (3) has a separate board of directors and keeps separate\nbooks and records from its subsidiaries; (4) does not own, lease, or have any real\nproperty in Massachusetts; (5) has no offices, agents, employees, mailboxes,\ntelephone listings, bank accounts, or business operations in Massachusetts; (6) does\nnot derive or expect to derive any direct revenue from goods consumed or services\nrendered in Massachusetts; (7) does not own the “H&R Block” servicemark; (8) does\nnot own, develop, or place any “H&R Block” or “Option One” advertisements; and (9)\ndoes not direct or control the day-to-day operations or management of H&R Block\nBank, H&R Block Mortgage, or Option One.  (Id. ¶¶ 3-21.)  Under these circumstances,\nplaintiffs have failed to meet the relatedness requirement and cannot establish specific\n14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 15 of 19\npersonal jurisdiction over H&R Block.8 \nC. General Jurisdiction\n“A court has general jurisdiction when the litigation is not directly founded on the\ndefendant’s forum-based contacts, but the defendant has nevertheless engaged in\ncontinuous and systematic activity, unrelated to the suit, in the forum state.”  Negron-\nTorres, 478 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs do not present sufficient evidence that H&R Block conducts continuous\nand systematic activity in Massachusetts.  Although they assert that H&R Block’s\ncorporate filing with the Massachusetts Secretary of State establishes that it is licensed\nto do business within the Commonwealth, the H&R Block, Inc. entity referenced in the\nfiling ceased to exist in 1993, when it merged into H&R Block Eastern Tax Services,\nInc.  (See Docket # 19, Ex. 1.)  The articles of merger confirm this interpretation. \n(Docket # 25, Ex. A.)  Plaintiffs do not proffer any other evidence that H&R Block is\nregistered to do business in Massachusetts.  Moreover, as discussed above, Mr.\nWilson’s affidavit directly contradicts any allegations that H&R Block is active in the\n8 Negron-Torres is directly on point.  In that case, the plaintiff suffered an injury\ndue to the alleged negligence of the local telephone company (the “PRTC”).  She sued\nVerizon Communications, the majority owner of PRTC by virtue of its controlling\ninterest in PRTC’s holding company, on the theory that “Verizon Communications\nexercised its authority over PRTC ‘to direct or cause the direction of management and\npolicies’ of PRTC,” and her cause of action arose “out of Verizon’s negligence in\nguiding, managing, controlling, and/or supervising the policies and procedures [PRTC]\nimplemented under Verizon’s management and instruction.”  478 F.3d at 25.  Verizon\nprovided a declaration directly contradicting these allegations and asserting that it was\nmerely a holding company that did not sell, market, or provide telecommunications\nservices.  The First Circuit held that the plaintiff had failed to meet the requirements of\nthe relatedness test because she “provided only conclusory allegations” to demonstrate\nthat the defendant’s in-state conduct formed a material element of proof in the case.  Id.\n15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 16 of 19\nCommonwealth.  (Wilson Aff. ¶ 9.) \nAs a general principle, jurisdiction over a wholly-owned subsidiary does not\nautomatically confer jurisdiction over the parent corporation.  United Elec., Radio and\nMach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1091 (1st Cir. 1992). \nNonetheless, plaintiffs suggest that H&R Block should be subject to jurisdiction in\nMassachusetts because of “its efforts to create an image in the public mind of H&R\nBlock as a single financial services conglomerate.”  (Docket # 19, 3.)  Plaintiffs point to\nthe company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which H&R\nBlock refers to itself and its subsidiaries as “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us,” as well\nas various website and marketing materials that they assert generically refer to “H&R\nBlock.”  (Id. at 11-12.)  However, the website and advertising materials submitted by\nplaintiffs expressly refer to entities other than H&R Block, Inc.  (See, e.g., Docket # 19,\nEx. 3 (H&R Block Services, Inc.); http://www.hrblock.com/mortgages/index.html (H&R\nBlock Bank).)  In any event, H&R Block has expressly stated that it does not own the\n“H&R Block” servicemark.  (Wilson Aff. ¶ 10.)  See Negron-Torres, 478 F.3d at 26 (“the\nmere use of a trademark or logo does not suffice to demonstrate the existence of the\nrequisite minimum contacts”).  In addition, it is difficult to agree with the proposition that\na company may waive any claim of corporate independence by merely collectively\nreferring to itself and its subsidiaries in public filings.  Indeed, the case law in this\ncircuit is clear that\nthe mere fact that a subsidiary company does business within a state does\nnot confer jurisdiction over its nonresident parent, even if the parent is sole\nowner of the subsidiary.  There is a presumption of corporate separateness\n16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 17 of 19\nthat must be overcome by clear evidence that the parent in fact controls the\nactivities of the subsidiary.\nId. at 27 (quoting Escude Cruz v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., 619 F.2d 902, 905 (1st Cir.\n1980)).  Plaintiffs cite only two cases in support of their argument, and both are easily\ndistinguished.  In Acorn v. Household Int’l, Inc., 211 F. Supp. 2d 1160 (N.D. Cal. 2002),\nthe plaintiffs proffered evidence that the parent company had participated in\nestablishing the challenged lending practices and had dictated the fees charged by its\nsubsidiaries and the specific language of the disclosures provided by its subsidiaries. \nSee id. at 1166.  This is precisely the evidence lacking in this case.  In Sorenson v.\nH&R Block, Inc., No. 99-10268-DPW, 2002 WL 31194868, at *6 (D. Mass. Aug. 27,\n2002), the plaintiffs asserted various claims against H&R Block Eastern Tax Services,\nInc., H&R Block Tax Services, Inc. and H&R Block, Inc. for damages stemming from the\npreparation of their tax returns.  Although the tax returns were prepared by H&R Block\nEastern Tax Services, Inc., the court extended jurisdiction over H&R Block Tax\nServices, Inc. based upon plaintiffs’ evidence that the latter exercised “pervasive\ncontrol” over the former.  Id.  It also extended jurisdiction over H&R Block, Inc. because\n“H&R Block” has been held out as one company, which performs only one\nbusiness (namely that of preparing income tax returns).  Certainly, then,\nthere would have been projected to [plaintiffs] sufficient ambiguity about any\ninternal separation in corporate identity and responsibilities to support a\n“reasonable perception that [the separate corporate entities] were one and\nthe same.”  \nId. (quoting United Electrical, 960 F.3d at 1095).  Even assuming, without necessarily\nagreeing, that the reasoning of Sorenson is correct, it lacks force in this situation, as all\nof the plaintiffs allege that they entered into loan agreements with Option One, not an\n17\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 18 of 19\nentity nominally similar to H&R Block.9  Indeed, the loan documents attached to their\ncomplaint do not reference H&R Block or H&R Block Mortgage at all.  (See Am. Compl.,\nExs. 1-12.)  Under these circumstances, it is difficult to discern a reasonable basis for\nplaintiffs to perceive H&R Block and Option One to be the same company.\nPlaintiffs have simply not put forth clear evidence demonstrating that H&R Block\nexercises control over the activities of subsidiaries which have continuous and\nsystematic activity in the Commonwealth and, as discussed above, Mr. Wilson’s\naffidavit expressly contradicts this notion.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have not established\nthe existence of general jurisdiction over H&R Block.\nD. Jurisdictional Discovery\nPlaintiffs seek jurisdictional discovery in the event that their allegations are\nfound lacking.  Contrary to their assertion, they are not “entitled” to jurisdictional\ndiscovery.  (Docket # 19, 17.)  Rather, the court retains “broad discretion” to permit “a\nmodicum of jurisdictional discovery” if the plaintiff puts forth a colorable claim of\npersonal jurisdiction and “present[s] facts to the court which show why jurisdiction\nwould be found if discovery were permitted.”  United States v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd.,\n274 F.3d 610, 626 (1st Cir. 2001).  “Failure to allege specific contacts, relevant to\nestablishing personal jurisdiction, in a jurisdictional discovery request can be fatal to\nthat request.”  Id. at 626-27.  Here, plaintiffs generally request discovery without any\n9 (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 77, 81 (Barretts twice refinanced their home loan with\nOption One); id. ¶ 93 (Guerrier and Bastien used Option One as their lender); id. ¶ 105\n(Grissets refinanced their loan with Option One); id. ¶ 119 (Parham refinanced with\nOption One).)\n18\n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 45   Filed 02/06/09   Page 19 of 19\nindication of the specific information they would seek or expect to find that would\nestablish personal jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the request for jurisdictional discovery is\ndenied.  See id. at 626.  However, plaintiffs will be getting discovery from the remaining\ndefendants.  If that discovery develops evidence demonstrating the existence of\npersonal jurisdiction over H&R Block in Massachusetts, plaintiffs may move to have it\nadded as a party again.10\nIV. Conclusion\nH&R Block’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (Docket # 11) is\nALLOWED.  The motion to dismiss by Option One and H&R Block Mortgage (Docket\n# 13) is DENIED.\n             February 6, 2009                     /s/Rya W. Zobel                     \n      DATE       RYA W.

This is a class action brought by Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and other \nsimilarly situated minority homeowners, against H&R Block, Inc., H&R Block Bank, and their \nwholly-owned subsidiaries, Option One Mortgage Corporation and H&R Block Mortgage Corp. \n(collectively \"Defendants\"), under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691, et seq. \n(“ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. Plaintiffs seek remedies for \nthemselves and the Class (defined in ¶83, below) for the discriminatory effects of the \nDefendants' home financing policies and practices. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 2 of 23\n2.  As described below, the Defendants have established a specific, identifiable and \nuniform credit pricing system, a component of which, referred to herein as the Discretionary \nPricing Policy, authorizes unchecked, subjective surcharge of additional points and fees to an \notherwise objective risk-based financing rate.  In other words, after a finance rate acceptable to \nthe Defendants is determined by objective criteria (e.g., the individual’s credit history, credit \nscore, debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratios), the Defendants' credit pricing policy \nauthorizes additional discretionary finance charges. These subjective, additional finance charges \nhave a widespread discriminatory impact on minority applicants for home mortgage loans, in \nviolation of ECOA and the FHA.   \n3.  The Defendants have established policies for retail and wholesale access to their \nloan products that subject minority financing applicants to a significantly higher likelihood of \nexposure to discretionary points and fees. These costs drive up the average cost of a mortgage \nloan made by one of the defendants to minority homeowners. \n4.  Plaintiffs seek damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, disgorgement and \nrestitution of monies disparately obtained from minority borrowers. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  Plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \nwhich confers original jurisdiction upon this Court in a civil action arising under federal law.   \n6.

Plaintiffs, Cecil Barrett Jr. and Cynthia Barrett, (the “Barretts”) are married \nminority homeowners who reside at 965 Morton Street, Mattapan, Massachusetts 02126.  \n8.  Plaintiffs, Jean Blanco Guerrier and Angelique M. Bastien (“Mr. Guerrier and \nMs. Bastien”) are married minority homeowners who reside at 38 Himoor Circle, Randolph, \nMassachusetts 02368.  \n9.  Defendant, H&R Block, Inc., offered a full range of home mortgage services \nthrough its direct and indirect subsidiaries, Option One Mortgage Corporation and H&R Block \nMortgage Corporation. H&R Block, Inc. is headquartered at One H&R Block Way, Kansas City, \nMissouri 64105.  \n10.  On or about May 1, 2006, Defendant, H&R Block Bank, a Federal Savings Bank, \nMember FDIC, commenced operations, at which time H&R Block, Inc. became a savings and \nloan holding company.  H&R Block Bank offers a variety of residential mortgage loan products.  \n11.  For the purposes of this complaint, H&R Block, Inc. and H&R Block Bank will \nbe collectively referred to as “H&R Block.”  \n12.  Defendant, Option One Mortgage Company (“Option One”) is a wholly-owned \nsubsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. Option One was primarily a wholesale mortgage lender and \noffered its services through its branches and a national network of mortgage brokers until \nDecember 2007, when H&R Block, Inc. terminated Option One’s loan origination business. \nOption One maintains a principal place of business at 3 Ada, Irvine, California 92618 and \nalthough it is not making new loans, continues its servicing and collection operations.  \n13.  Defendant, H&R Block Mortgage Corp. (\"H&R Block Mortgage\") is a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. H&R Block Mortgage was a retail mortgage lender \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 4 of 23\nmaking direct-to-consumer loans nationwide until H&R Block, Inc. terminated H&R Block \nMortgage’s loan origination business in 2007.

According to the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s Office,  H&R Block \nMortgage Corp. changed its name to Option One Mortgage Services, Inc. on or about July 23, \n2007.  \nFACTS \nA.  MORTGAGE LENDING IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORICALLY HAS \n   DISCRIMINATED AGAINST MINORITIES \n \n15.  According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University’s 2005 \nstudy called “The Dual Mortgage Market:  The Persistence of Discrimination in Mortgage \nLending,” mortgage lending discrimination today is subtle but pervasive, with minority \nconsumers continuing to have less-than-equal access to loans at the best price and on the best \nterms that their credit history, income, and other individual financial considerations merit more \nthan three decades after the enactment of national fair lending legislation. \n16.  The passage of civil rights legislation and fair lending laws in the 1960s and \n1970s brought an end to the most virulent forms of overt racial discrimination in the housing \nmarkets, but throughout the 1980s and 1990s, mortgage lenders found more subtle ways to \ndiscriminate, including maintaining offices only in white neighborhoods and engaging in \npractices such as redlining (refusing to lend on properties in predominantly minority \nneighborhoods). \n17.  After such redlining practices were challenged in the 1990s, mortgage lenders \nchanged tactics once again, making loans to minorities, but charging higher interest rates and \n  4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 5 of 23\nloan-related fees than they charged to similarly-situated white borrowers.  Loan data that \nmortgage lenders must now compile and disclose under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAct (“HMDA”) reveals profound loan pricing disparities between minority borrowers and \nsimilarly-situated white borrowers. \n18.  The HMDA requires mortgage lenders to report information about the home loans \nthey process each year.  In 2005, lenders reported information on more than 30 million home \nloan applications pursuant to HMDA.  In 1989, Congress required lenders to begin disclosing \ninformation about mortgage borrowers’ race and ethnicity.  In 2004, concerned with potential \nracial discrimination in loan pricing and recognizing that racial or other types of discrimination \ncan occur when loan officers and mortgage brokers have latitude in setting interest rates, the \nFederal Reserve Board began requiring lenders to also report information concerning rates, \npoints, and fees, charged to borrowers on high-cost loans. \n19.  According to the Federal Reserve, both 2004 and 2005 HMDA data revealed that \n“Blacks and minority borrowers were more likely . . . to have received higher-priced loans than \nnon-minority whites. . . . [which has] increased concern about the fairness of the lending \nprocess.”  Robert B. Avery, Kenneth P. Brevoort and Glenn B. Canner, “Higher-Priced Home \nLending and the 2005 HMDA Data,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, A124, A159 (revised Sept. 18, \n2006) (http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2006/hmda/bull06hmda.pdf) (last viewed \nDecember 19, 2007). \n20.  HMDA data for 2004 reveals profound loan pricing disparities between minority \nborrowers and non-minority whites even after controlling for borrowers’ gender, income, \nproperty location, and loan amount.  After accounting for those differences in the 2004 HMDA \ndata, minority borrowers were still almost twice as likely to receive a higher-rate home loan as \n  5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 6 of 23\nnon-minority whites.  (http://www.responsiblelending.org/pdfs/Testimony-Ernst061306.pdf) \n(last viewed December 19, 2007).  In a speech last year, the Vice-Chairman of the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, Martin Gruenberg, discussed the 2004 HMDA data and observed \nthat that data “clearly indicated” that minority borrowers are more likely to receive high-cost \nhome loans than are non-minority whites.  \n(http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/speeches/archives/2006/chairman/spoct1806.html) (last viewed \nDecember 19, 2007).   \n21.  Likewise, HMDA data for 2005 shows that “for conventional home-purchase \nloans, the gross mean incidence of higher-priced lending was 54.7 percent for blacks and 17.2 \npercent for non-minority whites, a difference of 37.5 percentage points.”  Avery, supra, at A159.  \nThe situation is similar for refinancing, where there is a difference of 28.3 percentage points \nbetween blacks and non-minority whites.  Id. at A124, A159. \n22.  The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) \nreleased a report entitled “The High Cost of Credit: Disparities in High-priced Refinanced Loans \nto Minority Homeowners in 125 American Cities,” dated September 27, 2005, that found that \n“[i]n every metropolitan area where at least 50 refinances were made to African-American \nhomeowners, African-Americans were more likely to receive a high-cost loan than White \nhomeowners.” \n23.  A growing number of research studies and investigations show that significant \nracial disparities still exist.  California Reinvestment Coalition, et al., “Paying More for the \nAmerican Dream: A Multi-State Analysis of Higher Cost Home Purchase Lending” (March \n2007) (http://www.nedap.org/pressroom/documents/2007_Report-2005_HMDA.pdf) (last \nviewed December 19, 2007); Ross, “The Continuing Practice and Impact of Discrimination” \n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 7 of 23\n(Revised July 2006) (Univ. of Connecticut, Working Paper 2005-19R) \n(http://www.econ.uconn.edu/working/2005-19r.pdf) (last viewed December 19, 2007). \n24.  Moreover, and importantly, research studies have suggested that borrowers’ credit \nprofiles cannot fully explain why some borrowers, and not others, are saddled with higher cost \nloans.  Researchers have raised “doubts that risk can adequately explain racial differences” in \nhigh-cost loans.  Bradford, Center for Community Change, “Risk or Race? Racial Disparities and \nthe Subprime Refinance Market” (May 2002) \n(http://www.knowledgeplex.org/kp/report/report/relfiles/ccc_0729_risk.pdf) (last viewed \nDecember 19, 2007).  In other words, evidence “suggests that weak borrower credit profiles do \nnot fully explain why some borrowers get stuck with higher-cost home loans.”  California \nReinvestment Coalition, et al., “Paying More for the American Dream: A Multi-State Analysis of \nHigher Cost Home Purchase Lending” (March 2007). \nB.  THE DEFENDANTS’ DISCRETIONARY PRICING POLICY CONTINUES THE \nPERVASIVE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MINORITIES IN MORTGAGE \nLENDING \n \n25.  Option One was one of the largest subprime mortgage-lending companies in the \nUnited States.   Option One publicly promoted its home financing expertise by means of \nnationwide advertising campaigns.  In its advertisements, Option One solicited persons to apply \nfor financing with Option One either in one of its branch offices or through one of the mortgage \nbrokers whom Option One had authorized to accept applications on its behalf.    \n26.   H&R Block made home-mortgage loans directly to consumers through its \nsubsidiary, H&R Block Mortgage. \n27.  Option One made home-mortgage loans - the majority of which were subprime \nloans - that were arranged by its loan officers and/or its network of mortgage brokers.  Those \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 8 of 23\nloans were made in reliance on Option One’s credit-granting policies and with the participation \nof  H&R Block.   \n28.  Due to H&R Block’s policies as to where to place its offices and how to market \nits products, minority borrowers were more likely than white borrowers to apply for credit from \nH&R Block through its sub-prime subsidiary Option One, or from an Option One authorized \nbroker.   \n29.  Because of the Discretionary Pricing Policy, loans obtained from Option One or \nOption One’s network of brokers are more expensive, on average, than loans obtained directly \nfrom H&R Block or H&R Block Mortgage.   \n30.  Based on the latest available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”) data \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development, minority homeowners who borrowed \nfrom Option One were more likely than whites to have received a high-APR loan. \n31.  A high-APR loan is a loan whose APR is at least three percentage points higher \nthan the interest rate on U.S. Treasury securities of the same maturity, at the time the loan was \nmade.  \n32.  While credit differences may explain some part of the disparities in rate and \nterms, the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy accounts for a significant portion of the \ndisparity. \n33.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy is unrelated to a borrower’s \nobjective credit characteristics such as credit history, credit score, debt-to-income ratio and loan-\nto-value ratios and results in purely subjective charges that affect the rate otherwise available to \nborrowers. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 9 of 23\n34.  Option One provided its loan officers and authorized mortgage brokers with \nsubstantial information about its loan programs, rates and credit criteria, as well as its policies for \ncompensating its loan officers and mortgage brokers who arranged business for it. \n35.  Option One authorized certain mortgage brokers to accept applications on its \nbehalf, to quote financing rates and terms (within the limitations set by H&R Block), to inform \ncredit applicants of Option One’s financing options and to originate finance transactions using \nH&R Block’s forms, in accordance with its policies.  \n36.  Option One provided its loan officers and brokers with credit applications, loan \ncontracts and other required financing forms, as well as instructions on filling out such \ndocuments necessary to complete home mortgage transactions.   \n37.  After a customer provided credit information to one of Option One’s loan officers \nor brokers, Option One computed a financing rate through an objective credit analysis that, in \ngeneral, discerned the creditworthiness of the customer. \n38.  These credit analyses considered numerous risk-related variables of \ncreditworthiness, including credit bureau histories, payment amounts, debt ratio, bankruptcies, \nautomobile repossessions, charge-offs, prior foreclosures, payment histories, credit score, debt-\nto-income ratios, loan-to-value ratios and other risk-related attributes or variables.  On \ninformation and belief, Option One used these variables to determine a “mortgage score” for \neach credit applicant. \n39.  Based on these objective risk-related variables and the resulting mortgage score, \nOption One derived a risk-based financing rate at which it would provide a home mortgage, \noften called the “Par Rate.”  Alternatively, experienced Option One loan officers and brokers \n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 10 of 23\nestimated the risk-related Par Rate by referring to the applicant’s credit bureau determined credit \nscore. \n40.  Although Option One’s initial analysis applied objective criteria to calculate this \nrisk-related Par Rate, Option One then authorized a subjective component in its credit pricing \nsystem —the Discretionary Pricing Policy — to impose additional non-risk charges. On \ninformation and belief, the applicable Par Rates and authorized discretionary charges were \ncommunicated by Option One to its loan officers and brokers via regularly published “rate \nsheets.” On information and belief, such rate sheets were published by Option One via intranet \nand internet. \n41.  The discretionary charges are paid by the customer as a component of the total \nfinance charge (the “Contract APR”), without the homeowner knowing that a portion of their \ncontract APR was a non-risk-related charge. \n42.  Loan officers and brokers had discretion, within the limits set by the Defendants, \nto impose discretionary mark-ups as additional points in interest – “a rate mark-up”, or as points \nand fees on the loan.  When there was a rate mark-up, the Defendants received additional \nincome.   \n43.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, by design, caused persons with \nidentical or similar credit scores to pay different amounts for the cost of credit.  As a result of \nusing a subjective pricing component that is designed to charge persons with the same credit \nprofiles different amounts of finance charge, the objective qualities of the initial credit analysis \nused to calculate the Par Rate are undermined and the potential for race bias became inherent in \nthe transaction.  \n  10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 11 of 23\n44.  The Discretionary Pricing Policy, although facially neutral (insofar as the \nDefendants use the same or effectively the same policy for all credit applicants), had a \ndisproportionately adverse effect on minorities compared to similarly situated whites in that \nminorities paid disparately more discretionary charges (both in frequency and amount) than \nsimilarly situated whites.  Statistical analysis of discretionary charges imposed on minority and \nwhite customers of other mortgage companies that use credit pricing systems structured like that \nof Option One has revealed that minorities, after controlling for credit risk, are substantially \nmore likely than similarly situated whites to pay such charges. \n45.    Loan officers and brokers are agents of Option One for the purpose of setting \ncredit price, which always was set based on the Defendants’ policy.   \n46.  The disparate impact suffered by minorities is a direct result of the Defendants’ \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy in that the Defendants designed, disseminated, controlled, \nimplemented and profited from the Discretionary Pricing Policy creating the disparate impact. \n47.  The Defendants have a non-delegable duty to ensure that their mortgage financing \nstructure and policies do not have a disparate impact on legally protected classes, such as \nminorities.  Despite having such a non-delegable duty, the Defendants chose to use, a \ncommission-driven, subjective pricing policy that they knew or should have known had a \nsignificant and pervasive adverse impact on minority homeowners.  \n48.  The disparities between the terms of the Defendants’ transactions involving \nminority homeowners and the terms involving whites homeowners cannot be a product of chance \nand cannot be explained by factors unrelated to race, but, instead, are the direct causal result of \nthe use of the discriminatory Discretionary Pricing Policy. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 12 of 23\n49.  There are no legitimate business reasons justifying the Defendants’ discriminatory \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy that could not be achieved by a policy that has no discriminatory \nimpact or a greatly reduced discriminatory impact. \nC.  THE DEFENDANTS’ DISCRETIONARY PRICING POLICY DISCRIMATED \nAGAINST PLAINTIFFS \n \nFacts Relating To The Barretts \n50.  Plaintiffs, Cecil Barrett Jr. and Cynthia Barrett reside at 965 Morton Street, \nMattapan, Massachusetts 02126.  \n51.  On or about January 16, 2004, the Barretts purchased their Mattapan home for \napproximately $277,000.00.  \n52.  On August 19, 2005, the Barretts refinanced their home loan with Option One.   \n53.  The loan, (Loan No. 161044209) was a 30-year, adjustable rate loan with a \ndisclosed APR of 8.653%. The loan amount was $416,000.00. According to the note, the loan \nhad a five-year fixed rate followed by a 25-year variable rate feature and was an interest only \nloan.  \n54.  According to the HUD-One Settlement Statement, the Barretts paid $21,641.08 in \nsettlement charges in connection with the loan, including, a $17,500 broker fee to Money-Wise \nSolutions (“Money-Wise”), an Option One authorized mortgage broker, a $620.00 processing fee \nto Money-Wise, a $650 underwriting fee to Option One and a $50.00 funding fee to Option One.  \n55.  True and correct copies of Truth-in-Lending disclosure and HUD-One Settlement \nStatement provided in connection with Loan No. 161044209 are attached hereto and labeled \nExhibit 1 and Exhibit 2, respectively. \n56.  On April 6, 2006, the Barretts refinanced their Option One loan with a second \nOption One loan.  \n  12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 13 of 23\n57.  The second loan (Loan No. 161048049), which has a loan amount of $500,000, is \nan adjustable rate loan with a balloon feature, providing for a final payment of $344,113.90. The \nAPR of the second loan was 10.536%.  \n58.  According to the HUD-One Settlement Statement, the Barretts paid $17,066.32 in \nsettlement charges in connection with the second loan, including, a $3,500 broker fee to Logic \nMortgage & Finance (“Logic”), an Option One authorized mortgage broker, a $595.00 \nprocessing fee to Logic, an $850 underwriting fee to Option One, a $50.00 funding fee to Option \nOne and a $7,500 loan origination fee to Option One.  \n59.  True and correct copies of the Truth-in-Lending disclosure and HUD-One \nSettlement Statement provided in connection with Loan No. 161048049 are attached hereto and \nlabeled Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4, respectively. \n60.  According to credit reports available to Option One, Mr. Barrett had an average \ncredit score of 681 and Ms. Barrett had an average credit score of 665 as of January 20, 2006.  \n61.   At the time of the transactions, the Barretts had credit scores that would have \nqualified with many lenders for a mortgage in the prime-market. Instead, the Barretts received \nmortgages at sub-prime rates and on sub-prime terms.  \n62.  On information and belief, unbeknownst to the Barretts, the contract APR on the \nmortgage loans were actually a combination of an objective, risk-based calculation and a totally \nsubjective, discretionary component added pursuant to the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy. \n63.  On information and belief, the Barretts were subject to the Defendants’ \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 14 of 23\n64.  On information and belief, the Barretts were charged a disproportionately greater \namount in non-risk-related credit charges than similarly situated white persons. \nFacts Relating To Mr. Guerrier And Ms. Bastien \n65.  Plaintiffs, Jean Blanco Guerrier and Angelique Bastien reside at 38 Himoor \nCircle, Randolph, Massachusetts 02368 with their teenaged son and daughter.  \n66.  On or about April 28, 2006, Mr. Guerrier and Ms. Bastien purchased their \nRandolph home for approximately $390,000 with Option One as the lender.  \n67.  The loan, (Loan No. 161048878) is a 30-year adjustable rate loan with a disclosed \nAPR of 10.844%. The loan amount was $360,000. According to the note, the loan had a two-\nyear fixed rate followed by a 28-year variable rate feature.  \n68.  Mr. Guerrier and Ms. Bastien first discovered that the loan had an adjustable rate \nat the closing, but felt pressured to close because they had sold their previous home on the same \nday. \n69.  According to the HUD-One Settlement Statement, Mr. Guerrier and Ms. Bastien \npaid $13,403.23 in settlement charges in connection with the loan, including, a $6,040.00 broker \nfee to LEHI Mortgage Services, Inc. (“LEHI”), an Option One authorized mortgage broker, a \n$570.00 processing fee to LEHI, a $295.00 application fee to LEHI, an $850 underwriting fee to \nOption One, a $50.00 funding fee to Option One and a $900 loan discount fee to Option One.  \n70.  True and correct copies of the Truth-in-Lending disclosure and HUD-One \nSettlement Statement provided in connection with Loan No. 161048878 are attached hereto and \nlabeled Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6, respectively. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 15 of 23\n71.  At the time of the transaction, Mr. Guerrier had a credit score that would have \nqualified with many lenders for a mortgage in the prime-market. Instead, Mr. Guerrier received a \nmortgage at sub-prime rates and on sub-prime terms.  \n72.  On information and belief, unbeknownst to Mr. Guerrier and Ms. Bastien, the \ncontract APR on the mortgage loans were actually a combination of an objective, risk-based \ncalculation and a totally subjective, discretionary component added pursuant to the Defendants’ \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy. \n73.  On information and belief, Mr. Guerrier and Ms. Bastien were subject to the \nDefendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy. \n74.  On information and belief, Mr. Guerrier and Ms. Bastien were charged a \ndisproportionately greater amount in non-risk-related credit charges than similarly situated white \npersons. \nALLEGATIONS OF NON-DISCLOSURE – FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT  \n(TOLLING) \n \n75.  The causes of action alleged herein accrued upon discovery of the discriminatory \nimpact of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class did \nnot discover and could not have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence the \nfactual bases of those claims.  Indeed, the data forming the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims only \nrecently was released and analyzed in a comprehensive manner.  Moreover, because the \nDefendants knowingly and actively concealed the facts alleged herein, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave been kept ignorant of vital information essential to the pursuit of these claims, without any \nfault or lack of diligence on their part. \n76.  Commission-driven, discretionary pricing systems, such as those used in the \nmortgage industry and structurally similar to the system utilized by the Defendants, have been \n  15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 16 of 23\nfound to produce significant discriminatory effects.  Knowledge concerning the significant and \npervasive discriminatory impact of such commission-driven, discretionary credit pricing systems \nhas been widely circulated within the financing industry for several years, as a result of \nnumerous actions by the United States Department of Justice and federal regulatory agencies. \nSee, Facts, section A supra. Thus, the Defendants knew or should have known that their credit \npricing system causes minority homeowners to pay more for mortgage financing than the \namounts paid by white customers with identical or effectively identical credit scores. \n77.  Despite the fact that the Defendants knew or should have known of the \ndiscriminatory effect of their Discretionary Pricing Policy, none of the loan documents inform \nthe customer that its finance rates ultimately are subjective and not based solely on risk-related \ncharacteristics. \n78.  The Defendants were and are under a continuous non-delegable duty to disclose \nto the Plaintiffs and Class material information regarding their loans.  The fact that certain loan \nterms are subjective and discretionary is information a reasonable borrower would consider \nimportant when deciding whether to accept the loan and on what terms.  The fact that the \nsubjective and discretionary components result in a disparate impact on minority is also \ninformation a reasonable minority borrower would consider important. \n79.  The Defendants failed to disclose this information, however, and Plaintiffs and \nClass Members reasonably relied upon the Defendants’ representation that terms of their loans \nwould be based on their creditworthiness.  The Defendants’ financing documents falsely fostered \nthe image that the Defendants offer competitive rates that objectively are set.  However, the \nDefendants never disclosed to its credit applicants the fact that: (a) its credit rates are subjective \nand can vary significantly among persons with identical credit profiles; and (b) it had authorized \n  16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 17 of 23\nand provided a financial incentive to mortgage brokers to subjectively increase the credit rate \nabove the rate otherwise available to the homeowner. \n80.  Due to the inherent nature of the Defendants’ undisclosed Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy and due to the Defendants’ deception and concealment, the Defendants’ minority \ncustomers had no way of knowing or suspecting: (a) the existence of the Defendants’ subjective \ncredit pricing policy; (b) that they were charged additional subjective credit charges;  (c) that \nthey were charged a disproportionately greater amount for their cost of credit than similarly \nsituated white persons, and or (d) that any part of the loan price was negotiable.  Thus, the \nDefendants are estopped from relying on any statutes of limitation in their defenses of this \naction. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n81.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation above as if set forth herein in full. \n82.  Plaintiffs sue on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of persons under Rules \n23(a) and (b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n83.  This class action is brought pursuant to ECOA and the FHA by the individual \nnamed Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all minority consumers (the “Class”) who obtained \nan  Option One home mortgage loan in the United States between January 1, 2001 and the date \nof judgment in this action (the “Class Period”) and who were subject to the Defendants’ \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy pursuant to which they paid discretionary points, fees or interest \nmark-ups in connection with their loan. The term “minority” refers to blacks and Hispanics as \ndefined by federal law.  \n  17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 18 of 23\n84.  The phrase \"Discretionary Pricing Policy\" refers to the Defendants’ policy of \nauthorizing its loan officers and brokers to impose subjective, discretionary charges and interest \nmark-ups that are included in the finance charge loans they originate.  \n85.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact size or identities of the proposed Class, since \nsuch information is in the exclusive control of the Defendants.  Plaintiffs believe that the Class \nencompasses many thousands or tens of thousands of individuals who are dispersed \ngeographically throughout the United States.  Therefore, the proposed class is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable. \n86.  All members of the Class have been subject to and affected by the same \nDiscretionary Pricing Policy.  There are questions of law and fact that are common to the Class, \nand predominate over any questions affecting only individual members of the Class.  These \nquestions include, but are not limited to the following: \na.  the nature, scope and operations of  Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy; \nb.  whether H&R Block, Inc., H&R Block Bank,  Option One, and H&R Block \nMortgage are creditors under the ECOA because, for example, in the ordinary \ncourse of its business they participate in the decision as to whether or not to \nextend credit to consumers; \nc.  whether  the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy is a facially neutral credit \npricing system that has effected racial discrimination in violation of ECOA; \nd.  whether there are statistically significant disparities between the amount of the \ndiscretionary charges  imposed on minority persons and the amount of the \ndiscretionary charges imposed on white persons that are unrelated to \ncreditworthiness; \n  18 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 19 of 23\ne.  whether any legitimate business reason for the Discretionary Pricing Policy can \nbe  achieved by a credit pricing system less discriminatory in its impact;  \nf.  whether the Court can enter declaratory and injunctive relief; and \ng.  the proper measure of disgorgement or damages.  \n87.  The claims of the individual named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class \nand do not conflict with the interests of any other members of the Class in that both the Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class were subject to the same Discretionary Pricing Policy that \ndisproportionately has affected minority homeowners. \n88.  The individual named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests \nof the Class. They are committed to the vigorous prosecution of the Class’ claims and have \nretained attorneys who are qualified to pursue this litigation and have experience in class actions \n– in particular, consumer protection and discrimination actions. \n89.  A class action is superior to other methods for the fast and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy.  A class action regarding the issues in this case does not create any problems \nof manageability. \n90.  In the alternative,  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the case, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the Class as a whole.  \nCOUNT I \nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT  \n \n91.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation above as if set forth herein in full. \n92.  The Defendants are creditors as defined in ECOA, and in the ordinary course of \nits business, participated in the decision of whether or not to extend credit to the Plaintiffs, the \nproposed Class representatives herein, and all prospective Class members.   \n  19 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-10157-RWZ   Document 1   Filed 02/01/08   Page 20 of 23\n93.  The Defendants designed, disseminated, controlled, implemented and profited \nfrom the discriminatory policy and practice alleged herein — the Discretionary Pricing Policy —\nwhich has had a disparate economic impact on minorities compared to similarly situated whites. \n94.  All actions taken by Option One’s loan officers and authorized brokers were in \naccordance with the specific authority granted to them by Option One and were in furtherance of \nthe Defendants’ policies and practices. \n95.  As a result of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, the Defendants have \ncollected more in finance charges from minority borrowers than from similarly situated white \npersons, for reasons unrelated to credit risk. \n96.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy violates the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act. \n97.  Plaintiffs and prospective class members are aggrieved persons as defined in \nECOA by virtue of having been subject to the Defendants’ discriminatory, Discretionary Pricing \nPolicy.  \nCOUNT II \nDISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT  \n \n98.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege every allegation above as if set forth herein in full. \n99.

As a result of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, the Defendants have \ncollected more in finance charges from minorities than from similarly situated white persons, for \nreasons unrelated to credit risk. \n102.  The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy violates the Fair Housing Act and \nconstitutes actionable discrimination on the basis of race. \n103.  Plaintiffs and the Class are aggrieved persons as defined in FHA by virtue of \nhaving been subject to the Defendants’ discriminatory, Discretionary Pricing Policy.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \n  a.
