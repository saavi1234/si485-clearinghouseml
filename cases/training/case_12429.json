    "summary": "<p>The plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights, filed this class action suit against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) in February 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The complaint alleged violations of the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 621 et seq., the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 670 et seq., and Oklahoma state law. The complaint alleged that DHS placed children in dangerous and inappropriate placements, including extended stays in emergency shelters; failed to monitor the safety of children in DHS custody due to excessive case worker caseloads; failed to provide mental health and other behavioral services; and failed to provide legal representation. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants from subjecting plaintiffs to practices that violate their constitutional rights.</p>\r\n<p>In April 2008, the defendants moved to dismiss the case and several Oklahoma-based children's agencies filed amici curiae briefs in response. In January 2009, Judge Gregory K. Frizzell granted the motion to dismiss claims under federal common law and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, but denied the motion with regard to the other claims. D.G. v. Henry, 594 F. Supp. 2d 1273 (N.D. Okl. 2009).</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2009, the court certified the class of the plaintiffs as all children who are or will be in the legal custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (1) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect; or (2) who are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect. The defendants appealed the ruling to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, but in February 2010, the appellate court upheld the class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then engaged in extensive and contested discovery. The plaintiffs provided five expert reports and filed numerous motions to compel the defendants to produce various items. The defendants moved for summary judgment and to decertify the class. In November and December 2011, the court denied the motion to decertify and granted the motion for summary judgment only as to claims pertaining to rights of familial association and procedural due process. 2011 WL 6009628. The case proceeded towards a trial scheduled for February 2012.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the parties engaged in court-supervised settlement conferences. By January 2012, they negotiated an agreement providing for structural reorganization of DHS and appointed experts to oversee the development and implementation of the Compromise Settlement Agreement (CSA). After a series of fairness hearings, the court approved the CSA on February 29, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>The CSA implementation plans provided that the defendant DHS would restructure its agency; improve screening, investigating, and reporting of abuse; reduce the use of emergency shelters; and reduce workloads and improve training for caseworkers. The parties agreed to designate three individuals as Co-Neutrals to act as arbiters of any dispute arising out of the CSA and to evaluate and render judgments about DHS's ongoing compliance efforts. The implementation of the CSA would take at least five years. Additionally, on March 31, 2013, the Court ordered the defendants to pay attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of about $6 million. 2013 WL 1343151.</p>\r\n<p>Although DHS originally planned to exit from the CSA in December 2016, it was unable to do so for failure to adequately comply with its terms. In their August 2018 report, the Co-Neutrals noted that although DHS had made important advancements over the course of its reform, those advances were not yet fully instituted, particularly with respect to manageable caseloads and an adequate array of placements for children. The report noted that in some areas, most critically safety for children in the care and custody of DHS, the department&rsquo;s efforts had been inadequate.</p>\r\n<p>In May 2018, the Co-Neutrals requested that the Court suspend the operations of a particular children's center for failure to comply with the CSA. The Court granted this request and DHS complied by relocating the children from that center.</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2018, the court entered a judgment and terminated the case. However, the case was reopened three years later when the parties moved to modify the settlement on December 13, 2021. This motion noted that unforeseen circumstances, namely the COVID-19 pandemic, seriously impacted the defendant&rsquo;s good faith efforts to comply with the settlement agreement. As a result, the parties agreed to suspend the previously scheduled biannual good faith determinations by the Co-Neutrals during the pandemic recovery period as to some of the defendant's obligations. The court granted the motion the following day.</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 2023, the Co-Neutrals determined that the Department had met the two-year continuous period of good faith requirements mandated by the CSA as to the obligations that had not been delayed by COVID-19. On April 24, 2023, the court issued an order terminating these obligations.</p>\r\n<p>Two years later, on February 11, 2025, the Co-Neutrals filed a final report indicating the defendants had complied for two years with the remaining CSA obligations. A month later, on March 13, the court terminated the defendant's obligations under the CSA. 2025 WL 818166. The case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

This case is brought by the Named Plaintiffs, nine children in foster care, \non behalf of themselves and the more than 10,000 children of Oklahoma who have been removed \nfrom their homes by the State.  These foster children, who are or will be in the legal custody of \nthe Oklahoma Department of Ruman Services (\"DRS\"), bring this action because DRS, under \nthe supervision of Defendants, who directly and indirectly control and are responsible for the \nadministration of Oklahoma's foster care system, have failed in their basic and fundamental duty \nto provide for the safety and care of these Oklahoma citizens. \n2.  Children who require placement in foster care are the most vulnerable \nmembers of Oklahoma society.  They are found in the four comers of the State; they come from \ncities, suburbs and rural areas. \n3.  In all cases, these children [md themselves in DRS custody as a result of \ndesperate and extreme circumstances that threaten their ability to live normal childhoods, to \ngrow and develop and, in many instances, to even survive.  But as this Complaint alleges, DRS \nis victimizing its foster children.  Rather than discharging its duty to keep the foster children in \nits custody reasonably free from harm, because of its pervasive, longstanding and well \ndocumented deficiencies in providing basic living situations, services and monitoring, DRS has \nharmed and continues to harm Oklahoma's foster children physically, emotionally and \npsychologically  repeatedly and without any plan to end that harm, as set forth herein. \n4.  As just one stark example, Named Plaintiff C.S. has been in foster care \nsince shortly after her birth, and in her eleven short months on this planet, DRS has placed her in \nseventeen different homes and facilities.  While in foster care, she has suffered a fractured skull \nas a result of physical abuse in an unsafe foster home; she has suffered severe dehydration and \nI \n\nseizures as a result of neglect in an unsafe group facility; and she has suffered a severe illness as \na result of neglect in another unsafe foster home.  Plaintiffs bring this case to redress and correct \nthe aggregate problems and failures at DHS that, inter alia, have resulted in such victimization. \n5.  This civil rights class action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on \nbehalf of all foster children who are or will be in the legal custody of D HS.  The foster children \nname as Defendants the Governor of the State of Oklahoma, the nine members of the Oklahoma \nCommission for Human Services, and the Director ofDHS (collectively, \"Defendants\").  All \nDefendants are sued in their official capacities.  Defendants directly and indirectly control and \nare responsible for the policies and practices of DHS, including those set forth herein. \n6.  Oklahoma owes no higher duty than to stop victimizing her foster children. \nDHS's failure to provide for the basic safety and care of foster children in DHS custody subjects \nthe children to significant, ongoing harm and imminent risk of harm, deprives them of chances \nfor safe and stable childhoods, and violates their rights under the United States Constitution and \nspecific federal statutes.  This action seeks solely declaratory and injunctive relief in order to \nstop continuing violations of the legal rights of Oklahoma's foster children and to prevent DHS, \nby it policies and practices, from continuing to harm the very children who rely on the State for \ntheir care and protection. \n7.  The sole purpose of this case is to redress the ongoing aggregate problems \nand failures at DHS, an executive agency of the State of Oklahoma, including:  (1) its failure to \nprovide safe and adequate living situations for foster children and to meet their service needs; \nand (2) its failure to adequately monitor the safety of foster children due to an overburdened and \nmismanaged workforce and dangerously inadequate oversight practices. \n2 \n\n8.  DHS bears the responsibility for having operated - and continuing to \noperate - a foster care system in which children routinely become victims ofDHS's failures. \nThese failures include. inter alia: \n•  A drastic shortage of foster homes. \nDHS fails to develop and maintain an adequate number and array of foster homes and \nother appropriate placements for foster children.  As a result, foster children are placed \nwherever a bed is available and without regard to their individual needs. \n•  Overcrowded and dangerous emergency shelters. \nDHS routinely houses foster children, including infants and toddlers, in overcrowded and \nunsafe emergency shelters for extended periods of time, sometimes in excess of six \nmonths, because DHS has nowhere else to house them. \n•  Unsafe and inappropriate foster homes and facilities. \nDHS utilizes foster homes that jeopardize the safety of children, including homes with \nadults who have criminal convictions, homes that are dirty, overcrowded or lack adequate \nfood, and homes in which supervision is dangerously lacking.  DHS also utilizes facilities \nto house foster children that are often unsanitary, lack adequate supervision and employ \nstaff who have not been properly trained and who have not even gone through \nbackground checks to identify criminal records or histories of abusive behavior. \n•  Excessive caseworker caseloads and an inexperienced and unstable workforce. \nFor each of the past six years, the Oklahoma Child Death Review Board has \nrecommended the hiring of more caseworkers to meet reasonable professional standards \nin order to reduce the number of deaths due to child abuse or neglect.  While those \nstandards limit caseloads to twelve to fifteen children per caseworker, DHS caseworkers \nare regularly assigned more than fifty children each, with some caseworkers responsible \nfor more than one hundred children.  As a result, caseworkers cannot make required visits \nwith foster children and caregivers, and cannot adequately monitor child safety.  The high \ncasel oads also contribute to high turnover and an inexperienced workforce. \n•  Grossly inadequate payment for the care of foster children. \nOklahoma fails to provide payments to those caring for foster children that even approach \nthe actual cost of those children's care.  The \"foster care maintenance payments\" set by \nDHS are grossly insufficient to provide basic support for foster children, and contribute \nto the shortage of foster homes. \n9.  As a result of these failures, DHS harms foster children and exposes them \nto imminent risks of harm, including the following: \n3 \n\n•  Abuse or neglect of foster children by foster parents or facility staff. \nFor the past five years, Oklahoma has been among the worst three states in the nation, \nand for two years the very worst in the nation, in its rate of \"abuse in care\" of foster \nchildren.  This includes physical abuse, sexual abuse or extreme neglect inflicted on \nfoster children by foster parents or staff at shelters or other facilities.  Abuse of children \nin state foster care custody takes place at a higher rate than for children in the general \npopulation:  in two of the past five years, the \"abuse in care\" rate of children in DHS \ncustody exceeded the rate ofc hild abuse or neglect in the general population in \nOklahoma.  And these statistics actually minimize the reality of in-care abuse; the rates \nreported by DHS significantly undercount the actual frequency of such abuse. \n•  Abuse or neglect of foster children by their biological parents while in DDS custody. \nWhile still in DHS custody, foster children in Oklahoma are victims of abuse or neglect \nby their biological parents when sent by DHS on overnight unsupervised visits or ''trial \nhome reunifications.\"  The rate of this harm to foster children is more than double the \nrate at which children are abused or neglected by foster parents or facility staff. \n•  Denial of opportunities to maintain critical family relationships. \nOklahoma foster children are routinely separated from their siblings who are also in DHS \ncustody and DHS fails to arrange visits or other contact with siblings when these \nseparations occur.  DHS also fails to provide to foster children visits and other contact \nwith biological parents, even when reunification is the goal set by DHS. \n•  Frequent moves among multiple inappropriate homes and facilities. \nRecent state data shows that 34% of foster children in Oklahoma had experienced four or \nmore placements and 17% - approximately 1,700 children - had experienced six or more \nplacements while in DHS custody.  Such routine moves from one inappropriate \nplacement to another inflict psychological harm and destroy these children's trust in \nadults, preventing them from developing an attachment to any family. \n10.  These failures and harms have been well documented and known to DHS \nfor many years.  In the face of that knowledge, DHS has consistently failed to address, let alone \nameliorate, these failures.  The harms - the physical, emotional and psychological injury and \ndeterioration of foster children while in DHS custody - inflicted daily on foster children in \nOklahoma, and the imminent risks of such harms to which they are repeatedly exposed, are the \ndirect result of the failures by DHS alleged in this Complaint. \n4 \n\nH.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n11.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of \nthe United States Constitution and federal statutes.  This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3). \n12.  Venue in this district is proper, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b), because \nthe claims arise in this district. \nHI.  The Parties \nA.  The Named Plaintiffs1 \n13.

Pursuant to Article XXV, Section 4 of the Constitution of Oklahoma, the \nDirector ofDHS serves as the chief executive and administrative officer of the Department.  The \nDirector of DHS is responsible for administering all DHS child welfare services and programs \nand assuring that all such services and programs operate in conformity with constitutional, \n11 \n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.  Pursuant to Oklahoma Administrative Code § 340: 1-1-4, \nthe Director ofDHS is charged with the responsibility for day-to-day direction of the activities \nnecessary for DHS to accomplish its mission, and the Director's duties include serving as chief \nspokesperson for DHS and ensuring that actions approved by the Commission for Human \nServices are carried out.  Director Hendrick serves by appointment of the Oklahoma Commission \nfor Human Services.  Director Hendrick maintains his principal office at Oklahoma Department \nof Human Services, Sequoyah Memorial Office Building, 2400 N. Lincoln Boulevard, \nOklahoma City, OK 73105. \nIV.  Class Action Allegations \n42.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) \nand (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n43.  The class is defined as \"all children who are or will be in the legal custody \nof the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (1) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or \nneglect, or (2) who are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.\" As used in this \nComplaint, the members of the class are referred to as the \"Class\" or the \"Plaintiff Children\" or \n\"foster children.\" \n44.  According to state data from 2006, approximately 10 ,000 foster children \nwere in the legal custody ofDHS.  The Class is sufficiently numerous to make individual joinder \nimpracticable. \n45.  The questions oflaw and fact raised by the Named Plaintiffs are common to \nand typical of those raised by the putative class members.  Named Plaintiffs, like the other \nPlaintiff Children, are children in DHS's legal custody who rely on DHS for their safety and \n12 \n\nwell-being, and have been harmed or are at imminent risk of harm by the common legal \ndeficiencies of Oklahoma's foster care system alleged in this Complaint. \n46.  Questions of fact common to the Class include: \na.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of failing to develop and \nmaintain a sufficient number and array of safe and appropriate \nplacements for Plaintiff Children, causing significant harm and risk \nof harm to Plaintiff Children's safety, health and well-being; \nb.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of failing to adequately \nmonitor the safety of Plaintiff Children, causing significant harm \nand risk of harm to Plaintiff Children's safety, health and well \nbeing; \nc.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of placing Plaintiff Children \nin unsafe and inappropriate homes and facilities, causing \nsignificant harm and risk of harm to Plaintiff Children's safety, \nhealth and well-being; \nd.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice that has the effect of \nsubjecting Plaintiff Children to abuse, neglect and other \nmaltreatment while in DRS custody, causing significant harm and \nrisk of harm to Plaintiff Children's safety, health and well-being; \ne.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of subjecting Plaintiff \nChildren to unreasonably frequent moves from placement to \nplacement, causing significant harm and risk of harm to Plaintiff \nChildren's health and well-being; \nf.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of failing to arrange for and \nfacilitate Plaintiff Children's family relationships, causing \nsignificant harm and risk of harm to Plaintiff Children's health and \nwell-being; \ng.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of failing to place Plaintiff \nChildren in the least restrictive and most family-like settings \nappropriate to their needs, causing significant harm and risk of \nharm to Plaintiff Children's health and well-being; \nh.  Whether DRS has a policy or practice of failing to provide \nadequate foster care maintenance payments and an adequate \nmethodology for calculating those payments for the care of \nPlaintiff Children; and \n13 \n\n1.  Whether the conduct described in sub-paragraphs a through h, \nabove, is contrary to law, reasonable professional standards and \noutside the exercise of any professional judgment. \n47.  Questions of law common to the Class include: \na.  Whether DHS's policies and practices violate Plaintiff Children's \nsubstantive due process rights to be reasonably free from harm and \nimminent risk of harm while in state custody, guaranteed by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nb.  Whether DHS's policies and practices violate Plaintiff Children's \nrights to family association and integrity, guaranteed by the First, \nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution; \nc.  Whether DHS's policies and practices violate Plaintiff Children's \nrights established by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare \nAct of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n1997, and relevant federal regulations; \nd.  Whether DHS's policies and practices violate Plaintiff Children's \nrights to procedural due process, guaranteed by the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; and \ne.  Whether DHS's policies and practices violate Plaintiff Children's \nrights as direct and intended third-party beneficiaries under the \nTitle IV-E State Plan contract executed between Oklahoma and the \nfederal government. \n48.  The legal violations alleged by the Named Plaintiffs and the resultant harms \nare typical of those raised by each member of the putative class. \n49.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nmembers of the putative class. \n50.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a Next Friend pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 17(c), and each Next Friend is sufficiently familiar with the facts of the child's \nsituation to fairly and adequately represent the child's interests in this litigation, and is dedicated \nto the child's best interests in this litigation. \n14 \n\n51.  The N arned Plaintiffs and the putative class are represented by: \na.  R. Thomas Seymour, a licensed Oklahoma attorney with extensive \nexperience in complex civil litigation, civil rights matters and class \nactions in the federal courts, and the law firm of Seymour & \nGraham, LLP; \nb.  Frederic Dorwart, a licensed Oklahoma attorney with extensive \nexperience in complex civil litigation and class actions in the \nfederal courts, and the law firm of Frederic Dorwart, Lawyers; \nc.  Doerner, Saunders, Daniel & Anderson, LLP, an Oklahoma law \nfirm with extensive experience in complex civil litigation and class \nactions in the federal courts; \nd.  Day Edwards, Propester & Christensen, PC, an Oklahoma law frrm \nwith extensive experience in complex civil litigation and class \nactions in the federal courts; \ne.  Attorneys employed by Children's Rights, a national nonprofit \nlegal organization whose attorneys have extensive experience and \nexpertise in child welfare class actions nationally; and \nf.  Kaye Scholer LLP, an international private law firm with extensive \nexperience in complex civil litigation and class actions in the \nfederal courts. \n52.  Counsel retained by the Named Plaintiffs are competent and experienced in \nclass action litigation, child welfare litigation and complex civil litigation. \n53.  The attorneys and entities listed above have investigated all claims in this \naction and have committed sufficient resources to represent the Class through trial and any \nappeals. \n54.  The attorneys and entities listed above know of no conflicts between or \namong members of the putative class. \n55.  Defendants, who directly and indirectly control or are responsible for the \npolices and practices ofDHS, have acted or failed to act in a manner generally applicable to the \nputative class, making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate and necessary. \n15 \n\nV.  Dangerous Failures in Oklahoma's Foster Care System Have Been Documented for \nOver Ten Years, Yet DHS Has Failed to Ameliorate Them or Implement Necessary \nReform \n56.  Oklahoma's child welfare system has steadily deteriorated since 1997 and \nis and has been incapable of fulfilling its duties to Plaintiff Children.  DHS has been aware of, \nyet has failed to address, these well-known problems. \n57.  In 1997, because of \"[h]igh levels of dissatisfaction with, and lack of \nconfidence in, Oklahoma's fragmented and complex foster care system,\" the Oklahoma House of \nRepresentatives Human Services Committee issued a report entitled \"Interim Study of the Foster \nCare System Throughout Oklahoma.\" This report was based on \"an in-depth study of the foster \ncare system in which every foster care home in the state was visited.\"  The 1997 report described \nseveral emerging problems with DHS that were causing harm to children.  It identified a shortage \nof foster homes and a lack of support for foster parents, stating \"[w  ]e recruit foster parents and \nwe don't support them afterwards, and then we lose them.\" \n58.  The 1997 report recommended that:  DHS reorganize the agency structure \nto create direct linkage among DHS, policy makers and field personnel;  DHS \"[r]eview number \nof staff, level and cases per staff to determine if more staffmg or realignment of staff is required \nto adequately service the foster care program;\" and DHS hire \"[m]ore caseworkers/staffing.\" As \nalleged below, in the ten years since that report, DHS has failed to correct any of the deficiencies \nidentified in the report. \n59.  In 1999, the Oklahoma legislature appointed a Child Welfare System \nReform Review Committee to study \"the policies, procedures, and statutes governing \nOklahoma's child abuse and child welfare system and to make recommended revisions to this \nsystem.\" This Committee issued a public report on January 24,2000, which stated that \"[t]he \n16 \n\ncaseloads for child protective services workers need to be within the bounds recommended by \nthe national standard.  The subcommittee believes [there is a] need for additional child welfare \nworkers.\" \n60.  In June of2001, the Governor's Task Force on Children in Custody \npresented its Annual Report to the Governor and the Director ofDHS, which focused on the lack \nof support given by DHS to foster parents throughout the state.  The report stated that there were \n\"foster parents with many years of experience who felt that the hassles and the lack of support \nfrom the Department made it next to impossible to continue to care for the children.\" The report \ncriticized DHS for retaliating against foster parents who raised issues with DHS:  \"any foster \nparent who 'makes waves' is at risk of losing the children in their home and having their home \nclosed by the Department.  Some foster parents even expressed fear of their own children and \ngrandchildren being removed by the Department.\" The report also highlighted that children in \nDHS custody were frequently placed in homes without foster parents receiving adequate \ninformation about the child's needs, medical history or family history, that DHS was performing \nonly cursory face-to-face visits with children in custody, and that DHS caseworkers were not \nequipped to answer foster parents' most basic questions about the status of their child's case.  In \nthe years since that report was published, DHS has failed to correct any of the deficiencies \nidentified in the report. \n61.  Because Oklahoma receives federal funding to operate its child welfare \nsystem, it is subject to periodic Child and Family Service Reviews (\"CFSRs\"), conducted by the \nAdministration for Children and Families, a division of the United States Department of Health \nand Human Services (\"HHS\").  These reviews are designed to assess whether states are in \n17 \n\nsubstantial confonnity with federal child welfare benchmarks in the areas of child safety, \npermanency and well-being. \n62.  Oklahoma's initial CFSR was completed in 2002.  In nearly every area \nreviewed, Oklahoma failed to meet federal standards, often by a wide margin.  Oklahoma failed \nwith respect to each of the seven \"safety, permanency and well-being outcomes\" tracked by the \nreview, which included:  protecting children from abuse and neglect; safely maintaining children \nat home when possible and appropriate; providing permanency and stability in children's living \nsituations; preserving continuity of family relationships and connections; enhancing families' \ncapacity to provide for children's needs; ensuring that children receive services to meet their \neducational needs; and ensuring that children receive services to meet their physical and mental \nhealth needs. \n63.  The 2002 CFSR found that DRS failed to meet the requirement that \n\"[c  ]hildren are, first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect,\" noting that the failure was \ndue to a \"high level of staff turnover among the child welfare agency's front-line workers, which \nresults in both inexperienced staff and excessive staff case1oads.\" RRS found that Oklahoma \nwas \"{nJ ot making sufficient efforts to reduce the risk ofh arm to children.\" (emphasis added). \n64.  Oklahoma's second CFSR took place in August of2007. Although the \nresults of that CFSR are not yet public, DRS published its own CFSR \"Statewide Assessment\" in \nanticipation of the federal review.  The CFSR Statewide Assessment documents DRS's \ncontinuing failure to protect children.  For example, the reported frequency of foster children \nabused or neglected by foster parents or residential facility staff while in DRS custody was 1.2% \nfor the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2006, which is nearly four times the maximum \nallowed federal benchmark of 0.32%. \n18 \n\n65.  The 2007 CFSR Statewide Assessment also documented the lack of foster \nhomes.  Over 95% ofDHS's Child Welfare staff who were interviewed as part of the CFSR \nStatewide Assessment reported there were not enough foster homes for children in DHS custody. \nAs a result, DHS often put foster children in placements that were likely to fail, resulting in \nchildren frequently being forced to move from one placement to another. \n66.  Echoing the 2002 CFSR, the 2007 CFSR Statewide Assessment repeatedly \ntied DHS's failures to worker turnover, inexperienced staff, excessive caseloads and an \ninsufficient number of foster homes. \n67.  The Oklahoma Child Death Review Board annually publishes the results of \ninvestigations conducted upon the death of a child.  In every year from 2001-2006, the \nOklahoma Child Death Review Board documented that DHS workers have caseloads two to \nthree times higher than national standards. \n68.  Every year, the Oklahoma Child Death Review Board has recommended \nthat DHS bring worker caseloads into compliance with nationally recognized standards in order \nto reduce child deaths and, in 2004, the Board explicitly recommended that DHS \"hire additional \nchild welfare staff in order to be in compliance with accepted national standards ... in order to \nreduce the number of deaths due to child abuse/neglect.\" \n69.  The dangerous failures at DHS have been repeatedly documented in the \nOklahoma media over the past three years.  For example, on December 18, 2005, the Tulsa \nWorld reported on the death of Felipe Gonzalez, a three-year-old foster child in Oklahoma City \nwho was killed while living in a foster home.  The article, entitled \"Who Dropped the Ball?\" \nstated that while \"Oklahoma DHS officials approved the placement of Felipe and his sister in the \n19 \n\n[foster] home, state officials never conducted the required in-home visits during the six months \nthe siblings [lived in that home].\" \n70.  On February 19,2006, the Tulsa World published an editorial entitled \n\"Oklahoma's Child Welfare System Needs Restructuring.\" This editorial stated that DRS \"is the \nsystem that is supposed to protect children, but many times it is the system that re-victimizes a \nchild.  For the most part, this isn't the fault of the many caring professionals that work in the \nchild welfare system.  It is the system that needs to be turned upside down, inside out, and \nchanged.\" \n71.  On September 24, 2006, the Daily Oklahoman published an editorial \nentitled \"Foster Care System Needs Reform.\" This editorial chronicled DRS's \"glaring \nproblems,\" including \"inadequate numbers of foster homes across the state, insufficient \nreimbursement to foster parents for children's basic needs [and] burdensome case loads for DRS \ncase workers who monitor these Children[.]\" \n72.  On December 7, 2006, an article in the Daily Oklahoman entitled \"Welfare \nWorkers Knew of Problems Before Child's Death, Records Show\" reported on the death of \nSamuel Barber, a three-month-old baby who died in Oklahoma City's Pauline Mayer Emergency \nShelter.  The Daily Oklahoman reported that \"state child welfare workers were aware of \nproblems with [the] family before Oklahoma County sheriffs deputies found four children living \nin dog feces and garbage at a home.\"  The article stated that the infant was kept in the Mayer \nEmergency Shelter for several days - in violation of DRS policy  before he died.  The official \nDRS spokesman stated:  \"If there are no foster homes and no kinship, yet the court won't let \nthem return home, there are no other options.  We have to keep them in the shelter. ... The state \nof Oklahoma is the worst parent a child could have.\" \n20 \n\nVI.  Failures in the Operation of the Oklahoma Foster Care System \n73.  DHS operates a system in which the long-known, pervasive failure to \nprovide for the basic safety and well-being of children continues to directly harm foster children \nin DHS custody and places them at imminent risk of harm.  As alleged herein, this failure \nincludes, and is a direct result of:  (1) DHS's failure to provide safe and adequate living \nsituations for Plaintiff Children and to meet their service needs, including grossly inadequate \nfoster care maintenance payments to foster parents and the failure to plan for and take mandated \nsteps to fmd permanent and safe homes for Plaintiff Children outside of state custody; and (2) \nDHS's failure to adequately monitor the safety of Plaintiff Children due to an overburdened and \nmismanaged workforce and dangerously inadequate oversight practices.  These failures are \nobvious, and the harm and imminent risk of harm they cause have been well documented and \nknown to DHS, yet DHS has failed to take appropriate steps to address and ameliorate them. \n74.  As a result, Defendants, who directly and indirectly control and are \nresponsible for the policies and practices ofDHS, have failed to exercise any professional \njudgment and have acted with deliberate indifference to the safety, well-being and legal rights of \nPlaintiff Children. \nA.  Plaintiff Children Are Victimized While in DHS Custody \n75.  DHS's failure to provide Plaintiff Children with safe and adequate living \nsituations and services and its failure to adequately monitor Plaintiff Children's safety directly \ncause Plaintiff Children to suffer from abuse or neglect while in DHS custody at an alarming \nrate.  This \"abuse in care\" rate includes reports of physical abuse, sexual abuse or extreme \nneglect at the hands of foster parents or facility staff who are providing direct care for Plaintiff \n21 \n\nChildren under the ostensible supervision ofDHS.  Such reports are investigated and ultimately \n\"confrrmed\" by DHS. \n76.  According to state data, in each of the past five years, from Federal Fiscal \nYear (\"FFY\") 2001 through FFY 2005, Oklahoma has been among the worst three states in the \ncountry for confrrmed abuse or neglect of foster children in state custody.  In four of those five \nyears, Oklahoma ranked worst or second worst in the nation and, in two of those years, \nOklahoma had the single highest rate of confrrmed abuse of foster children in state custody in the \nnation. \n77.  Oklahoma's rate of abuse or neglect of children in foster care has invariably \nfar exceeded the benchmarks set by the federal government.  In 2002, 1.62% of Oklahoma foster \nchildren were abused or neglected, almost three times greater than the federal benchmark of \n0.57% for children in foster care; in 2003, the Oklahoma rate rose to 1.88%, or 3.3 times the \nfederal benchmark.  In fact, in 2002 and 2003, the rates of abuse and neglect of children in foster \ncare in Oklahoma were so high that Plaintiff Children suffered abuse or neglect at a higher rate \nthan children in the general popUlation (as recorded in 2002 and 2003 at 1.57% and 1.43%, \nrespectively). \n78.  In FFY 2004, 1.23% of Oklahoma foster care children were the victims of \nconfirmed abuse or neglect while in state custody, more than twice the federal benchmark.  The \nfollowing year, FFY 2005, the rate was 1.17%, again more than twice the federal benchmark. \n79.  Most recently, Oklahoma's performance in subjecting Plaintiff Children to \nabuse or neglect has only worsened on a national scale.  Last year, the federal government \npublished a new benchmark of a maximum rate of abuse or neglect of 0.32%, reflecting a lower \nabuse in care standard nationwide.  According to state data, for the twelve-month period ending \n22 \n\nMarch 31, 2006, 1.2% of children in foster care in Oklahoma were abused or neglected while in \nstate custody, almost four times the current national standard. \n80.  The federal abuse in care measure discussed above includes only foster \nchildren abused or neglected by foster parents or residential facility staff, and excludes foster \nchildren who are the victims of confirmed abuse or neglect by their biological parents while still \nin the state's custody (i.e., while on a visit or on trial home reunification). \n81.  In Oklahoma, the number of foster children abused or neglected by their \nbiological parents while still in DHS custody is dangerously high and increasing.  According to \nstate data, another 2.04% of Oklahoma foster care children were the victims of confirmed abuse \nor neglect by their biological parents while in DHS custody.  In FFY 2005, this rate rose to 2.2%, \nand by the twelve-month period ending March 31,2006, rose again, to 2.3%. \n82.  From July 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006, over 1,700 foster children in \nOklahoma were victims of confirmed abuse or neglect by foster parents, facility staff or their \nbiological parents while in DHS custody. \n83.  The official rate of abuse and neglect of foster children in DHS custody \noutlined above consistently underreports the occurrence of abuse in care, since those rates only \ninclude incidents of abuse or neglect which have been investigated and confirmed by DHS. \nIncidents of abuse or neglect, and other serious maltreatment of foster children such as the use of \ncorporal punishment and other prohibited forms of discipline, occur regularly and are never \nidentified or reported, let alone investigated, due to DHS's failure to adequately monitor the \nsafety and well-being of children in its care. \n23 \n\nB.  DHS Houses Plaintiff Children in Dangerous and Inappropriate Placements \nThat Fail to Provide Adequate Protection or Meet Their Needs \n84.  DRS has engaged in a policy, pattern, custom and/or practice of placing \nchildren in dangerous and inappropriate placements that fail to provide adequate protection and \ncare.  DRS has been and is fully aware of the dangers of this policy, pattern, custom and/or \npractice, but has failed to act to prevent it or correct it.  By subjecting Plaintiff Children to \nplacement practices that are emotionally, psychologically and physically injurious to them, DRS \nhas acted and continues to act with deliberate indifference to the welfare of Plaintiff Children \nand to Plaintiff Children's legal rights, and outside any reasonable exercise of professional \njudgment.  This policy, pattern, custom and/or practice has caused, and is causing, direct and \nsevere harm or imminent risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \n1.  DHS's Failure to Develop and Maintain a Sufficient Number and \nArray of Foster Care Placements \n85.  DRS has failed to develop and maintain a sufficient number and array of \nfoster care placements necessary to allow DRS to place Plaintiff Children in safe environments \nwhere their basic needs can be met.  Despite being on notice for years of a growing and drastic \nshortage of foster homes and other appropriate foster care placements, DRS has failed to take \neven the most basic steps to address the problem. \n86.  The severe shortage of foster care placements strains the DRS placement \nsystem, leading to placement matches driven solely by the immediate availability of a bed rather \nthan a child's individual needs, and resulting in the frequent \"disruption\" of foster homes and the \nmovement of foster children from one placement to another. \n87.  The placement shortage also causes DRS to keep open dangerous homes \nand facilities, without addressing known safety problems.  DRS places Plaintiff Children in \n24 \n\nunsafe, unsupported or unsuitable foster homes and facilities, and leaves foster children, even \ninfants and toddlers, languishing in emergency shelters.  The shortage is particularly severe for \nadolescents, and for children who require homes with foster parents who have specialized \ntraining and supports to address behavioral problems (also called \"therapeutic foster care\" \nhomes), or who otherwise have significant mental health or behavioral needs.  At the same time, \nDHS frequently places older foster children in institutional facilities for long periods of time \nwhen they should be in less restrictive placements. \n2.  DBS Unnecessarily Institutionalizes Plaintiff Children in Dangerous \nand Inappropriate Emergency Shelters for Extended Periods of Time \n88.  Under federal law, DHS policy and reasonable professional standards, \nchildren taken into foster care custody must be placed in the least restrictive and most family-like \nenvironment possible, taking into account the child's needs.  DHS routinely places children of all \nages  even infants and toddlers - for extended periods of time in dangerous, overcrowded and \ninappropriate emergency shelters without adequate staffmg and services, resulting in harm or \nimminent risk of harm to Plaintiff Children. \n89.  Because of the grave shortage of foster homes, foster children who are \nremoved from their homes and placed in DHS custody are routinely placed in an emergency \nshelter - often far from their home community  as their fITst placement.  In fact, all children \nremoved from their homes in Oklahoma and Tulsa Counties, the largest counties in the state, are \nfITst placed in an emergency shelter.  The 2002 CFSR confrrmed that DHS \"was placing children \nin emergency shelters without attempting to find more appropriate alternative placements, such \nas relatives or a foster home.\" This practice continues today.  Hundreds of children in DHS \ncustody are placed in over thirty emergency shelters throughout the state at any given time. \n25 \n\n90.  Although the emergency shelters used to house foster children in DRS \ncustody are intended to be very short-term placements until appropriate placements are found, \nchildren in DRS custody frequently languish in emergency shelters for many months at a time, \nsometimes for more than six months, because DRS has nowhere else to place them.  Plaintiff \nChildren with special mental health or behavioral needs remain in emergency shelters for \nespecially long periods of time.  This harmful practice violates DRS's own policy mandating that \nchildren younger than five years old remain in shelters for no more than twenty-four hours. \n91.  Not only do children in DRS custody who are initially brought into shelters \nremain there for long periods of time, but these same children frequently return to shelters for \nlong periods of time when other placements are disrupted, which occurs frequently due to DRS's \nfailure to adequately match placements with Plaintiff Children's needs and its failure to provide \nservices and supports to these placements.  The 2002 CFSR reported that this results \"in a pattern \nof children moving in and out of shelter care.\" This practice continues today. \n92.  The serious shortage of appropriate out-of-home placements for children in \nDRS custody results in chronic and dangerous overcrowding at the two largest emergency \nshelters in Oklahoma. \n93.  DRS operates the Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter in Oklahoma City, \nwhich is licensed to house forty-two children, but routinely houses more than sixty children due \nto the lack of any alternative placements.  In order to avoid violations from the Fire Marshal for \novercrowding, DRS routinely shuffles children out of this shelter and temporarily places them in \nday care facilities, group homes or other placements which have \"shelter overflow\" \narrangements with DRS. \n26 \n\n94.  DHS operates the Laura Dester Emergency Shelter in Tulsa, which is \ncurrently approved to house fifty children, but routinely houses more than sixty children.  In \n2005, shelter capacity reached a record high of eighty-five children in one day.  The Dester \nShelter was over capacity on 325 days in fiscal year 2006. \n95.  Infants and toddlers are especially vulnerable and subject to harm as a result \nof the persistent overcrowding at DHS-operated emergency shelters.  In Tulsa, most children \nentering the Dester Emergency Shelter are five years old or younger.  The \"Little House\" of the \nDester Emergency Shelter has twenty-five beds for newborns; at times, however, it holds over \nthirty babies.  In Oklahoma City, the Annex building to the Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter is \nused as additional shelter space to house babies, infants and toddlers who are removed from their \nhomes and placed in DHS custody.  It is licensed for sixteen children, but routinely exceeds this \nlimit.  Contrary to reasonable professional standards, DHS policy, and outside the exercise of \nany professional judgment, DHS routinely places infants and toddlers in shelters for extended \nperiods of time, without appropriate staffmg and services. \n96.  As a result of the severe overcrowding at the Tulsa and Oklahoma City \nemergency shelters, Plaintiff Children are often forced to live in dangerous and grossly \ninappropriate conditions.  Children who have just been through the trauma of being removed \nfrom their homes due to abuse or neglect are routinely forced to sleep on cots or in cribs in \nhallways, recreation rooms and play areas of the emergency shelters and, at times when \novercrowding is too extreme, in DHS offices. \n97.  Emergency shelter placements in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and elsewhere in \nthe state also house children with aggressive physical or sexual behaviors together with \n27 \n\nvulnerable children, including those who have been sexually abused or have significant \ndevelopmental disabilities.  This unsafe practice puts Plaintiff Children at extreme risk of harm. \n98.  Additionally, when DRS places Plaintiff Children in emergency shelters, \ntheir education is often disrupted, sometimes for many weeks, impeding their educational \ndevelopment and access to basic and adequate education while in state custody. \n3.  DBS Places Plaintiff Children in Dangerous and Inappropriate \nBomes and Facilities While in DBS Custody \n99.  As a direct result of the drastic shortage of foster care homes, DRS \nroutinely places Plaintiff Children in dangerous and inappropriate homes and facilities, including \nfoster homes, group or institutional placements, day care facilities and the homes of biological \nparents or relatives, where Plaintiff Children are harmed or subjected to imminent risk of harm. \n100.  Overcrowding in foster homes is common in Oklahoma.  For example, \nfoster homes licensed for four foster children often have seven or more foster children placed in \nthem, in addition to any biological children of the foster parents in the home.  This overcrowding \nfrequently prevents adequate parental supervision and places Plaintiff Children at serious risk of \nharm. \n101.  DRS also routinely sends Plaintiff Children to stay with their biological \nfamilies or relatives for unsupervised visits or for unsupervised and unmonitored trial home \nreunification while still in DRS custody, in which the children's safety is at risk.  Children often \nbecome victims of abuse or neglect during these unsupervised visits or unsupervised and \nunmonitored trial home reunifications. \n102.  For example, in March of 2007, three-year-old Blake Ragsdale died while \nin DRS custody after DRS had unlawfully placed Blake back with his biological mother without \nthe required court order approving the trial home reunification.  Blake was born addicted to \n28 \n\nmethamphetamine and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and a rare metabolic dysfunction that \nwas fatal if not treated.  He could not walk or talk and required a walker, several medications and \nconstant supervision.  However, DHS placed Blake back with his biological mother two and a \nhalf weeks prior to Blake's death without notifying the Juvenile Court or Blake's attorney, \nalthough Blake's mother had not completed her treatment plan, was unemployed, did not have a \nhome phone or car, and was woefully unequipped to take care of Blake's special medical needs. \nDHS also failed to provide Blake's mother with services necessary to enable her to care for her \nson. \n103.  DHS had previously reunified Blake with his mother, but Blake had been \nbrought back into DHS custody in 2006 because he was in critical condition and because his \nmother had failed to take him to his necessary physical therapy appointments.  A doctor \ndiagnosed him with \"failure to thrive.\" Despite the obvious inability of Blake's mother to take \ncare of his serious medical needs and her negligence in caring for Blake, DHS made the decision \nto place Blake back with his mother again in 2007.  That poor decision resulted in Blake's death. \n104.  DHS further abrogated its duties by failing to report Blake's death to the \nChild Death Review Board or the Juvenile Judge in charge of Blake's case.  Instead, the matter \nonly came to light when Blake's case was randomly chosen for an audit by DHS at the end of \n2007.  DHS then tried to hide its mistakes by removing vital information from the final DHS \nreport to the District Attorney on Blake's death.  Although contained in a draft report, the final \nversion of the report omitted all text stating that there had been no court-approved trial home \nreunification.  In addition, no one at DHS has been held accountable for Blake's death.  The \nDHS caseworker in charge of Blake's case now works for DHS in another county. \n29 \n\n105.  DRS also frequently mixes aggressive, or even violent, foster children, \nincluding children with histories of sexual or assault offenses, in the same foster homes, group \nhomes and facilities, in close proximity to non-violent children, including those who have been \nsexually abused or have developmental disabilities, placing Plaintiff Children at imminent risk of \nharm. \n106.  Despite the explicit prohibition in DRS policy against the use of any form \nof physical discipline or corporal punishment on children in DRS custody, Plaintiff Children are \nroutinely victims of physical discipline in foster homes and residential facilities.  Even when \nDRS caseworkers are aware that physical discipline has been used on a foster child, corrective \nactions are often not taken or not monitored to ensure they are implemented. \n107.  DRS also routinely places children in custody in dangerous residential \nfacilities and group homes, where safety hazards include unsanitary conditions, staff shortages \nand inadequate supervision, incomplete requisite staff training and licenses, and inappropriate \ngrants by DRS of criminal background waivers for staff. \n108.  Foster children in DRS custody are also placed in DRS-licensed day care \nfacilities, which are often inadequately monitored and supervised, and which subject Plaintiff \nChildren to harm and imminent risk of harm. \n4.  DBS Frequently Moves Children From One Inappropriate Placement \nto Another, Causing Them Severe Emotional and Psychological Barm \n109.  Moving foster children among multiple homes and facilities causes them \nserious emotional and psychological harm, and damages their ability to trust and form \nrelationships with adults. \n110.  Due to the drastic shortage of foster homes and the chronic overcrowding in \nemergency shelters, children in DRS custody are routinely placed without regard to their specific \n30 \n\nneeds or the training and capacity of the foster parents or other caretakers with whom they are \nplaced.  As a result, children are placed wherever a bed or slot is available and placements are \nfrequently disrupted, causing severe emotional and psychological harm to Plaintiff Children as \nthey are shuffled from one inappropriate placement to another. \n111.  The 2002 CFSR found that \"children in the system are moved too \nfrequently from one placement to another\" and \"placement resources are insufficient with respect \nto both quality and quantity.\" It also found \"that there is too much pressure on agency workers \nto move children out of shelter placement into a home.  Because of this pressure, placements are \noften made without careful supervision, and when the homes do not meet the child's needs the \nplacement disrupts.\"  These problems continue today. \n112.  According to state data, as of March 31, 2006, more than 52% of children \nin DRS custody had experienced three or more placements.  Almost 17% had six or more \nplacements, which means that approximately 1,700 children in DRS custody had experienced the \ntrauma of moving among at least six placements. \n113.  In reality, Plaintiff Children move even more frequently than is reflected in \nstate data because DRS often fails to track Plaintiff Children's location and movement once they \nare placed with a private provider of homes under contract with DRS, which in turn may move \nPlaintiff Children among many placements. \n114.  DRS routinely fails to ensure that Plaintiff Children's personal belongings \nfollow them when they move from one placement to another, adding to the trauma that children \nexperience from frequent and abrupt moves while in DRS custody. \n115.  The multiple moves to which DRS subjects foster children forces them to \nfrequently change schools, miss an unnecessary amount of school, and fall behind in school. \n31 \n\nDHS regularly fails to ensure that Plaintiff Children's educational records follow their numerous \nplacement moves.  In addition, for Plaintiff Children who require special education services, \nDHS routinely fails to ensure that their \"'Individualized Education Plans\" are prepared and \nupdated. \n5.  DDS Prevents Plaintiff Chlldren From Maintaining Critical Family \nTies While in State Custody \n116.  Placing children near their home minimizes the trauma they have already \nsuffered from removal, helps children maintain ties with parents and siblings, and avoids \nunnecessary separation from school, other family members, friends and existing local supports. \nIn contrast, due to the drastic shortage of foster homes, DHS sends most children in foster care to \nlive in placements that are distant from their homes, schools and communities, often hundreds of \nmiles away. \n117.  Due to the shortage of homes and facilities, DHS also routinely separates \nsiblings in custody, causing them further harm by interfering with critical family relationships. \nThe 2002 CFSR found that siblings in DHS custody are rarely placed together because of the \nshortage of foster homes.  This problem continues today. \n118.  DHS also repeatedly fails to ensure that siblings in DHS custody who are \nnot placed together at least have frequent visits with one another.  DHS's routine denial of \nPlaintiff Children's right to sibling visitation keeps them from maintaining critical family \nrelationships. \n119.  D HS also routinely fails to provide regular visits and contact between \nPlaintiff Children and their biological parents, even when reunification is the goal set by DHS. \nThis failure deprives Plaintiff Children of critical parental relationships and family ties. \n32 \n\nC.  DHS's Failure to Adequately Monitor the Safety of Children in DHS \nCustody Subjects Plaintiff Children to Harm or Imminent Risk of Harm \n1.  Excessive Caseloads, Inexperienced Caseworkers, Inadequate \nSupervision, High Turnover and Inadequate Training Threaten Basic \nChild Safety \n120.  DHS caseworkers are responsible for monitoring the safety and well-being \nof foster children in state custody, ensuring that their service needs are being met, ensuring that \nthe homes and facilities that care for them are meeting their needs, and ensuring that they move \ntoward the goal of a permanent home out of state custody.  Because of the vital role played by \ncaseworkers, national professional standards prescribe caseload limits of between twelve and \nfifteen children per worker for foster care services, and caseload limits of no more than twelve \ninvestigation cases for workers conducting intake and child protective service investigations. \nNational professional standards also prescribe supervisory ratios of one supervisor to every five \ncaseworkers. \n121.  DHS caseworkers consistently have caseloads that are at least two to three \ntimes higher than national standards.  Currently, individual caseloads for foster care workers \n(also called \"permanency planning workers\") routinely exceed fifty children, with some workers \nhaving caseloads of more than one hundred children.  Individual caseloads for \"intake\" and child \nprotective services workers, who in Oklahoma are responsible for ensuring safety and services to \nPlaintiff Children after they are removed from their homes and before children are assigned to a \npermanency planning worker, routinely exceed forty-five investigation cases (and over one \nhundred children).  Supervisors responsible for caseworkers often supervise seven or more \ncaseworkers  sometimes even up to eleven workers  who in turn have excessive caseloads, \nmaking adequate supervision impossible. \n33 \n\n122.  DRS caseworkers carry such high caseloads because DRS does not employ \nenough caseworkers to adequately serve all of the children in DRS custody.  This pervasive \nproblem has been well documented for many years, yet DRS has failed to address it.  For \nexample, every Annual Child Death Review Board report from 200 I to 2006 has stated that \nlowering caseloads to meet national standards would reduce child deaths, yet caseloads remain \ndangerously high today. \n123.  Due to a combination of unmanageable workloads and poor caseworker \nsupport from DRS, turnover remains a serious problem, and leads to a largely inexperienced \nworkforce.  For example, due to excessive turnover at DRS, as of April of 2007, there were one \nhundred vacant child welfare specialist positions.  In a December 5, 2007 article in the Daily \nOklahoman, titled \"DRS Falls Behind on Cases,\" a DRS representative admitted that the \nmajority of DRS staffhas less than two years' experience. \n124.  Caseworkers leave DRS so frequently that their caseloads are absorbed by \nthe already overloaded existing workforce.  In fact, after caseworkers leave DRS, their cases \noften remain uncovered for weeks, or sometimes even months, until another caseworker first \nlooks at them. \n125.  In addition to high caseloads and turnover, DRS fails to provide adequate \ntraining to caseworkers concerning the protection and care required of foster children and fails to \nensure appropriate supervision of caseworkers.  In fact, training and supervision are so minimal \nthat caseworkers frequently are not familiar with basic DRS policies.  DRS also routinely fails to \nhold caseworkers accountable for their failure to exercise any professional judgment in making \ndecisions concerning the care of foster children. \n34 \n\n2.  DHS's Dangerous Monitoring and Oversight Practices of Foster \nHomes and Facilities Harm Plaintiff Children and Expose Them to \nImminent Risk of Harm \n126.  DHS has a policy, pattern, custom and/or practice of providing inadequate \nmonitoring and oversight of foster homes and facilities that house Plaintiff Children - both DHS-\noperated homes and facilities and those that are directly managed by private agencies under \ncontract with DHS.  As a direct result ofDHS's failure to appropriately screen, approve and \nmonitor homes and facilities where children in DHS custody are placed, Plaintiff Children have \nbeen and continue to be harmed and placed at imminent risk of harm. \n127.  DHS caseworkers fail to make required visits with foster children and their \ncaregIvers.  Regular caseworker visits are necessary for monitoring a child's safety and well-\nbeing and the appropriateness of the child's placement, identifYing the child's needs, and \narranging and monitoring the delivery of services to meet those needs.  DHS policy requires \ncaseworkers to make regular face-to-face contact at least once a month with the Plaintiff \nChildren on their case10ads and with those children's caregivers, and also to visit foster homes at \nleast monthly.  For Plaintiff Children who are placed in emergency shelters, DHS caseworkers \nmust have face-to-face contact within twenty-four hours of their entry into the shelter and a \nminimum of weekly visits while the child remains in the shelter. \n128.  Due to excessive caseloads, DHS caseworkers routinely fail to visit \nPlaintiff Children for months at a time, and sometimes fail to visit Plaintiff Children for six \nmonths or more.  This failure jeopardizes the safety of Plaintiff Children on an ongoing basis, \nleaving them at risk of abuse, neglect or other maltreatment.  When visits to children in DHS \ncustody do occur, they are regularly made by inexperienced and unqualified \"case aides,\" rather \nthan by DHS caseworkers. \n35 \n\n129.  The routine placement of Plaintiff Children far from their home \ncommunities has resulted in the DHS practice of assigning \"secondary\" DHS caseworkers to \nvisit Plaintiff Children in the counties where they are currently housed.  However, due to \nexcessive workloads, \"secondary\" DHS caseworkers often fail to visit or otherwise monitor and \nsupervise the Plaintiff Children assigned to them.  Additionally, \"secondary\" DHS caseworkers \nroutinely fail to share information or coordinate efforts with \"primary\" DHS caseworkers, who \nremain responsible for Plaintiff Children' s safety and well-being, and for implementing plans to \nseek and secure a permanent home out of state custody for Plaintiff Children. \n130.  DHS routinely fails to furnish basic, accurate and current information about \nPlaintiff Children to the juvenile courts and to the attorneys who represent Plaintiff Children, \nincluding required timely notification of Plaintiff Children's placement moves. \n131.  DHS frequently fails to adequately screen and investigate potential foster \nparents and their homes before approving them for the placement of children in DHS custody \nand before putting Plaintiff Children in their homes.  For example, a recent report by the \nOklahoma Commission on Children and Youth documented that, of sixteen foster homes in a \nparticular county, four homes - or 25%  had serious safety issues and never should have been \napproved for placement by DHS. \n132.  DHS policy requires all foster homes to be formally re-assessed and re \nlicensed or approved on a yearly basis.  This process is not consistently followed, and DHS \nregularly fails to complete these annual inspections.  The pressure to keep foster homes open, \ndue to the lack of placements for foster children, contributes to the routine failure by DHS to \nadequately review and re-license or approve homes to ensure their safety. \n36 \n\n133.  DHS fails to adequately investigate reports or suspicions of abuse or \nneglect in foster homes and facilities, which places Plaintiff Children at serious risk of harm. \nDHS caseworkers regularly ignore complaints by children in DHS custody of abuse or neglect by \ntheir foster parents or facility staff and obvious signs of abuse or neglect in placements.  DHS \nalso fails to close foster homes promptly - or close them at all-where children in DHS custody \nhave been subjected to abuse or neglect.  In those instances where DHS does investigate \nallegations of abuse or neglect in foster homes, due to the shortage of foster homes, DHS \nroutinely keeps children in the foster homes pending results of the investigation, even if there are \nallegations of serious injury. \n134.  DHS routinely fails to adequately screen, inspect, approve and certifY the \nhomes of relatives (also called \"kinship\" homes) for foster children.  D HS policy allows children \nin custody to be placed in kinship foster homes pending DHS approval of the homes, but only \nafter criminal background checks and an initial home assessment are completed.  These basic \nprotections are routinely ignored.  The initial assessments are assigned to DHS caseworkers who \nare overburdened with other responsibilities and onerous caseloads, sometimes in excess of one \nhundred children per worker.  In violation ofDHS policy, DHS often fails to conduct the \nrequired criminal background checks on all other adults residing in the kinship home before \nplacing Plaintiff Children in the home. \n135.  DHS inspections of facilities which house foster children are often cursory, \nas DHS inspectors do not interview foster children who are living in the facilities and, as a result, \noften overlook dangerous and inappropriate conditions.  Even where violations are discovered \nand reported at facilities, DHS does not ensure that they are timely corrected, placing Plaintiff \nChildren at risk of harm. \n37 \n\n136.  DHS often fails to adequately supervise and monitor the safety and quality \nof the homes, facilities and services provided by private agencies under contract with DHS. \n137.  DHS routinely fails to make reasonable efforts to locate children in DHS \ncustody who have run away from their placements in order to ensure their safety and well-being. \nThis poor monitoring and oversight practice harms Plaintiff Children and places them at \nimminent risk of harm. \n138.  DHS denies adequate support to foster parents who take care of Plaintiff \nChildren, by failing to provide adequate initial and ongoing foster parent training and by failing \nto provide foster parents with basic and necessary information about the foster children who are \nplaced in their homes.  Additionally, due to excessive workloads, caseworkers are routinely \ninaccessible to foster parents. \n139.  Foster parents also fear retaliation by DHS for advocating on behalf of the \nfoster children for whom they care.  DHS workers sometimes remove Plaintiff Children from \nfoster homes as a response to foster parents who assert themselves to get questions answered or \nto access needed services.  As a result, foster parents are often wary of requesting help to obtain \nfor foster children the services to which they are entitled.  These practices harm Plaintiff \nChildren and place them at imminent risk of harm, and reduce the number of appropriate foster \nparents who might otherwise be willing to provide homes for Plaintiff Children. \nD.  Additional Dangerous Failings by DHS Subject Plaintiff Children to Harm or \nImminent Risk of Harm \n1.  DHS Fails to Provide Adequate Foster Care Maintenance Payments \nfor the Care of Plaintiff Children \n140.  Oklahoma receives federal funding to provide licensed foster parents with \n\"foster care maintenance payments,\" which are defined by DHS policy as payments adequate to \n38 \n\ncover ''the cost of (and the cost of providing) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervisions, school \nsupplies, a child's personal incidentals, liability insurance with respect to a child, and reasonable \ntravel to the child's home for visitation.\"  Oklahoma accepts federal funding for foster care \nmaintenance payments, but fails to provide payments to caregivers offoster children that cover \nthe reasonable actual cost of care under federal law . \n141.  The foster care maintenance payments in Oklahoma are not based on a \nmethodology reflecting the actual and reasonable payments that cover the cost of (and the cost of \nproviding) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervisions, school supplies, a child's personal \nincidentals, liability insurance with respect to a child and reasonable travel to the child's home \nfor visitation. \n142.  The actual foster care maintenance payment rates in Oklahoma fall far short \nof the actual and reasonable costs required by federal law.  For example, DRS pays foster parents \na basic foster care rate of only $365 a month - less than $12 a day - to raise a child up to six \nyears old.  According to a national research study published in 2007 by the University of \nMaryland, Children's Rights and the National Foster Parent Association, Oklahoma's foster care \nmaintenance payments would need to be increased by over 50% before they could begin to cover \nthe reasonable and actual costs of raising a child pursuant to federal law . \n143.  DRS's failure to provide adequate foster care maintenance payments as \nrequired by federal law directly contributes to the drastic shortage in the number and array of \nfoster homes for Plaintiff Children in Oklahoma.  DRS provides foster parents with payments for \nthe direct and intended benefit of Plaintiff Children that are too low to attract and retain qualified \nfoster parents, or to provide foster parents with adequate resources such that Plaintiff Children \ncan receive basic necessities.  As a result, DRS's inadequate foster care maintenance payments \n39 \n\ndirectly contribute to Plaintiff Children being routinely placed in grossly inappropriate \nemergency shelters, and other unsafe and inappropriate homes and facilities. \n144.  Additionally, because the cost of caring for foster children becomes more \nexpensive as children get older, adequate foster care maintenance payments under federal law are \nhigher for older children than for infants and toddlers.  However, DHS has a policy, pattern, \ncustom and/or practice of failing to increase the basic rate for foster care maintenance payments \nas a function of age unless foster parents specifically request such an increase.  As a result, many \nfoster parents in Oklahoma who are raising teenagers receive grossly inadequate foster \nmaintenance payments that are set at the already inadequate rate for infants and toddlers. \n2.  DHS Fails to Plan for and Take Mandated Steps to Find Permanent \nand Safe Homes and Exits From State Custody for Plaintiff Children \n145.  DHS routinely fails to meet statutory timetables and other requirements for \nproviding Plaintiff Children with specific services and steps to ensure their prompt placement in \na permanent home outside of state custody, also called \"permanency planning\" services.  These \nrequirements include determining whether children can be safely and promptly returned home \nand, if DHS determines that is not appropriate, taking mandated steps to place children with an \nalternative permanent family, usually through adoption. \n146.  For example, DHS routinely fails to conduct timely required \"diligent \nsearches\" for possible relatives who can care for Plaintiff Children, as soon as they are brought \ninto state custody, in violation ofDHS policy, federal law and reasonable professional standards. \nThis DHS failure directly results in the placement of Plaintiff Children with strangers, and the \nloss of opportunities for Plaintiff Children to live with family members while in foster care or \npermanently out of state custody.  This DHS failure also subjects Plaintiff Children to the \nemotional and psychological trauma of additional, unnecessary placement moves, as DHS \n40 \n\nroutinely pulls Plaintiff Children out of the homes of foster parents with whom they have formed \nrelationships and places them in relative homes that DHS could easily have identified earlier. \n147.  Federal and state law, as well as DHS policy, require that a petition to \nterminate parental rights (also called a \"TPR\"  petition) must be filed for children who have been \nin state custody for fifteen of the last twenty-two months in order to begin the process of making \nthem legally available for adoption, unless compelling reasons against filing a TPR are \ndocumented in the child's case file.  According to recent state data, Oklahoma was in violation of \nthis requirement more than half the time.  Even when parental rights have been terminated for \nchildren in DHS custody, DHS fails to take steps to move foster children promptly and safely \ntowards adoption, forcing them to needlessly languish in state custody. \n148.  DHS also fails to provide required services to foster children aged sixteen \nand older who cannot be returned home or adopted to help prepare them to live on their own \nwhen they are discharged from DHS custody at the age of eighteen, also known as \"independent \nliving services.\" These services include job training, drivers education courses, life skills \ntraining and college preparation courses.  Such services are routinely not provided to eligible \nPlaintiff Children.  Additionally, required \"independent living plans\" are rarely provided for \neligible foster youth and, when they are provided, are grossly inadequate.  As a result, older \nfoster children routinely leave DHS custody without the basic life skills and training necessary to \nlive on their own, and many face unemployment, long term public assistance, incarceration or \nhomelessness. \n3.  DHS Fails to Arrange Mental Health Services for Plaintiff Children \n149.  Children entering foster care often have experienced significant trauma, \nresulting in physical, emotional or behavioral issues that require mental health treatment. \n41 \n\nPlaintiff Children are routinely prescribed psychotropic medications to ''manage'' their \nbehaviors, yet DHS fails to arrange for mental health treatment and therapy to address Plaintiff \nChildren's mental health needs.  This DHS failure harms Plaintiff Children and places them at \nimminent risk of harm. \n4.  Plaintiff Children Are Denied Adequate and Effective Legal \nRepresentation in the Juvenile Courts \n150.  Under Oklahoma law, an attorney must be appointed to represent every \nchild in a proceeding to determine if the child is deprived, and every child who has been subject \nto abuse or neglect.  These attorneys are required to provide their clients with adequate and \neffective legal representation and zealous advocacy in order to ensure their safety and well-being \nand to promote their best interests, throughout their experience in the juvenile courts. \n151.  Among other things, attorneys representing Plaintiff Children in the \njuvenile courts must investigate cases and meet with their client children outside of court prior to \ncourt proceedings.  Published national standards require that attorneys representing abused and \nneglected children have caseloads of no more than one hundred individual children per attorney, \nto make it possible for them to perform these and other critical functions in providing legal \nrepresentation to foster children. \n152.  However, attorneys charged with representing abused and neglected \nchildren in Oklahoma routinely carry unmanageably high caseloads.  For example, attorneys \nrepresenting Plaintiff Children in Oklahoma City have caseloads in excess of 1,300 children, and \nattorneys representing Plaintiff Children in juvenile court in Tulsa have caseloads in excess of \n500 children. \n153.  As a result of the excessively high workloads of attorneys assigned to \nrepresent Plaintiff Children, these lawyers are routinely unable to consult with their clients \n42 \n\nbefore court appearances and are unable to provide adequate or effective counselor zealous \nadvocacy.  DRS regularly fails to inform attorneys of the location of the Plaintiff Children they \nrepresent, a problem compounded by the frequent multiple moves to which foster children are \nsubjected while in DRS custody.  DRS also frequently fails to take steps to facilitate meetings \nbetween Plaintiff Children and their attorneys. \n154.  In 2006, due to pressure from attorneys, DRS contracted with the \nAmerican Bar Association (\"ABA\") to conduct a study of the quality oflegal representation for \nchildren in the juvenile courts.  The ABA conducted the study and then circulated a draft report \nin 2007, which stated:  \"The quality of legal representation for children, parents and the State is \ninadequate ... [T]here are not enough attorneys to do the work.  Current caseloads leave \nattorneys in an untenable position; they are painfully aware of what is required to properly serve \ntheir clients and want to provide the highest quality of legal representation possible - but given \nunmanageably high caseloads are unable to perform fundamental responsibilities.\"  The ABA \ndraft report noted that, due to the sheer volume of their caseloads, these attorneys were put in \npositions where they were violating their ethical responsibilities to the children they represent. \n155.  Plaintiff Children are routinely denied adequate and effective legal \nrepresentation in the juvenile courts.  As a result, Plaintiff Children are also denied an important \nsafeguard to identify potential threats to their safety and well-being while in DRS custody, \nplacing them at risk of imminent harm. \n5.  Breach of the Oklahoma State Plan Contracts Harms Plaintiff \nChildren \n156.  The federal government has approved the State Plans submitted by \nOklahoma in order to receive federal fmancial assistance under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the \nSocial Security Act, to help fund the state's child welfare, foster care and adoption programs. \n43 \n\nThese State Plans are contracts into which the State of Oklahoma enters for the express and \ndirect benefit of Plaintiff Children, who are direct and intended third-party beneficiaries of these \ncontracts.  Defendants are directly responsible for fulfilling the obligations undertaken by \nOklahoma when it entered into these State Plan contracts, including but not limited to the \nobligation to administer the programs in accordance with specific relevant state statutes, \nregulations and policies and all applicable federal statutes, regulations and other official \nissuances of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. \n157.  Defendants, who directly and indirectly control and are responsible for the \npolicies and practices ofDHS, have breached their obligations to Plaintiff Children under these \nState Plan contracts, and Plaintiff Children have been harmed and placed at imminent risk of \nharm as a result of this breach. \nVII.  Additional Factual Allegations Concerning Named Plaintiffs \nD.G. \n158.  DHS has victimized D.G. through unsafe placements and numerous \nmoves, the failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to \nprovide services necessary to facilitate his prompt and safe reunification with his biological \nparents, and the failure to seek and secure another permanent home for D.G. out of state custody \nthrough adoption.  These harms and D.G.'s continued instability and risk of harm are a direct \nresult ofDHS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to find an appropriate placement for D.G. \nand its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over its placements and over his \ncare. \n159.  D.G. entered DHS custody in Oklahoma County in September of2007, \nwhen he was only seven days old, due to his mother's chronic drug abuse.  With no foster homes \n44 \n\navailable, DHS ftrst placed D.G. in the poorly supervised baby Annex of the Pauline Mayer \nEmergency Shelter in Oklahoma City.  In violation ofDHS policy and reasonable professional \nstandards limiting shelter stays for children under ftve years old to a maximum of twenty-four \nhours, DHS kept D.G. languishing in the shelter for at least twenty-two days. \n160.  In September of 2007, due to inadequate supervision by DHS at the \novercrowded Mayer Emergency Shelter, a DHS worker carrying D.G. and another infant at the \nsame time dropped D.G.  who was then less than a month old  and he fell and struck his head \non the floor.  DHS did not take D.G. to the hospital until the next day, where he was diagnosed \nwith a fractured skull. \n161.  After D.G.'s stay at the hospital, DHS placed D.G. in an \"emergency \nfoster home\" for seventeen days.  DHS then moved D.G., at the age of two months, to another \ntemporary foster home, where he currently lives, likely to be moved yet again. \n162.  D.G. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DHS \nduring his time in state custody.  With no opportunity to form a relationship with a consistent and \nsafe adult caregiver, D.G. waits for a stable and permanent placement as he faces more and more \nmoves in foster care.  In addition to its failure to keep D.G. safe while in state custody, DHS \nfailed to provide the services necessary to facilitate D.G.'s prompt and safe reuniftcation with his \nbiological parents.  Although the parental rights ofD.G.'s parents have now been terminated, \nmaking him legally available for adoption, DHS has failed to seek and secure another permanent \nhome for D.G. through adoption, so he can leave DHS custody. \n163.  DHS's policies and practices have causedD.G. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject D.G. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DHS has violated D.G.'s \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect him from unnecessary harm and failing \n45 \n\nto keep him reasonably safe from hann while in government custody; failing to provide him with \na living environment that protects his physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide him with services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating or being hanned \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing him in an \nemergency shelter or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to his individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide him with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that he can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a pennanent family; failing to provide him with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DRS; failing to provide him care, \ntreatment, and services, detennined and provided through the exercise of accepted, reasonable \nprofessional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, control and discipline \nof his DRS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of his current status and needs; \nfailing to place him in the least restrictive placement according to his needs; failing to develop \nand implement timely written case plans that include mandated elements; failing to provide \nappropriate, adequate and timely investigations into suspected abuse or neglect while he was in \nDRS custody; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to placing him in such homes; and \nfailing to provide him with foster placements that are receiving adequate foster care maintenance \npayments so that they have the capacity to provide for his essential needs and services. \ne.s. \n164.  DRS has victimized C.S. through unsafe placements and numerous moves, \nthe failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to provide \nrequired visits from her DRS caseworkers, the failure to arrange regular contact with her \n46 \n\nsiblings, the failure to provide required medical treatment, and the failure to provide services \nnecessary to facilitate her prompt and safe reunification with her biological mother or, if DHS \ndetermines that is not appropriate, the failure to seek and secure another permanent home for \nC.S. out of state custody through adoption.  These harms and C.S.'s continued instability and risk \nof harm are a direct result ofDHS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to find an appropriate \nplacement for C.S. and its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over its \nplacements and over her care. \n165.  C.S. entered DHS custody in Tulsa County in February of 2007, when she \nwas only a few days old, due to her mother's chronic drug abuse.  In her first few months in \ncustody, DHS moved C.S. through an emergency shelter, an \"emergency foster home\" and three \nfoster homes.  DHS then placed C.S. with a relative in an unsafe and inadequately monitored \nkinship foster home, where she was thrown against a wall, fracturing her skull, and where she \nwas likely subjected to Shaken Baby Syndrome.  After C.S. was removed from the kinship foster \nhome and hospitalized for her injuries, with no foster homes available, DHS placed the then five \nmonth-old C.S. in the overcrowded and poorly supervised \"Little House\" for babies at the Laura \nDester Emergency Shelter in Tulsa, a grossly inappropriate placement for an infant. \n166.  DHS then moved C.S. through three temporary foster homes over the next \ntwo months, after which DHS placed her with her biological mother in a group facility in Tulsa, \nwhere C.S. remained in DHS custody.  Due to DHS's failure to adequately monitor this \nplacement, C.S. was severely neglected.  Her safety and care were so poorly supervised that she \nwas removed and hospitalized for severe dehydration and subsequently suffered from seizures. \n167.  After her hospitalization, DHS moved C.S. through two more foster \nhomes over the next few months, during which time she suffered from a severe, untreated and \n47 \n\nworsening respiratory tract infection.  DHS failed to provide basic monitoring or supervision of \nC.S.'s health and safety and, when DHS removed C.S. from the second foster home, she had \nopen sores on her legs, was dehydrated, was oozing puss and phlegm out of her mouth and nose, \nand was struggling to breathe. \n168.  When DHS placed C.S. in her next temporary foster home  her sixteenth \nplacement in eleven months in DHS custody - despite C.So's clearly critical medical condition, \nDHS failed to provide the foster parents with any information about C.S. 's background, prior \nharms or current medical condition or needs.  The foster mother immediately took C.S. to a \ndoctor, who diagnosed e.s. with a \"failure to thrive\" and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (\"RSV\"), a \nhighly contagious but easily treatable respiratory tract infection that can be fatal if untreated for \nchildren under three years old, and prescribed her antibiotics.  On a later visit to the doctor, the \nfoster mother also learned that C.S. had serious allergies to pets, and her allergies were inflamed \nbecause DHS had placed her in a home that had both cats and dogs.  As a result, DHS moved \nC.S. to another temporary foster home where she currently resides, likely to be moved yet again. \n169.  C.S. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DHS \nduring her time in state custody.  After suffering from severe abuse in DHS custody, and \nnumerous inappropriate and unnecessary placement moves, C.S. is an eleven-month-old baby \nwho, due to DHS's failings, has not had a single opportunity to form a relationship with a safe, \nconsistent adult caregiver in her entire life.  She has developed Reactive Attachment Disorder, \nmanifested by her crying out when an adult tries to hold her.  DHS has failed to arrange for C.S. \nto have regular contact with her siblings in order to maintain critical family relationships.  DHS \nhas also failed to provide the services necessary to facilitate C.S. 's prompt and safe reunification \nwith her biological mother or, ifDHS determines that is not appropriate, to seek and secure \n48 \n\nanother permanent home for C.S. through adoption, so she can leave DHS custody.  As a result, \nat any moment, C.S. is at risk of more moves, more instability and more harm from inappropriate \nplacements. \n170.  DHS's policies and practices have caused C.S. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject C.S. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DHS has violated C.S. 's \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect her from unnecessary harm and failing to \nkeep her reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide her with a \nliving environment that protects her physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide her with services necessary to prevent her from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing her in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to her individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide her with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that she can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide her with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DHS; failing to provide her care, \ntreatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise of accepted, reasonable \nprofessional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, control and discipline \nof her DHS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of her current status and needs; \nfailing to place her in the least restrictive placement according to her needs; failing to develop \nand implement timely written case plans that include mandated elements; failing to provide \nappropriate, adequate and timely investigations into suspected abuse or neglect while she was in \nDHS custody; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to placing her in such homes; \n49 \n\nfailing to preserve family connections and to facilitate visits with her siblings; and failing to \nprovide her with foster placements that are receiving adequate foster care maintenance payments \nso that they have the capacity to provide for her essential needs and services. \nJ.B. \n171.  DRS has victimized lB. through unsafe placements and numerous moves, \nthe failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to provide \nrequired visits from his DRS caseworkers, the failure to arrange regular contact with his siblings, \nand the failure to provide services necessary to facilitate his prompt and safe reunification with \nhis biological mother or, if DRS determines that is not appropriate, the failure to seek and secure \nanother permanent home for J.B. out of state custody through adoption.  These harms and J.B.'s \ncontinued instability and risk of harm are a direct result of DRS's drastic placement shortage, its \nfailure to find an appropriate placement for J.B. and its failure to provide adequate monitoring \nand oversight over its placements and over his care. \n172.  J.B. entered DRS custody in Oklahoma County in October of2006, when \nhe was only two days old, due to neglect by his mother and sexual abuse perpetrated on his \nsiblings by a male living with his mother.  After placing lB. in a foster home for a few months, \nDRS moved J.B. and three of his siblings back into the home of their biological mother on a trial \nhome reunification, although DRS had not provided J.B.'s mother with the services necessary to \nenable her to care for her children.  DRS retained custody of lB. and was required to provide \nhim with supervision, monitoring and services to ensure his safety during the entire trial home \nreunification, but failed to do so.  J.B.'s DRS caseworker failed to make required visits to J.B. in \nhis mother's home.  During the trial home reunification, J.B.'s mother continued to use drugs, \nand she continued to allow the man who had sexually abused lB.'s siblings to live in her house. \n50 \n\nIn October of 2007, DHS fmally removed J.B. from his mother's home due to neglect and the \ndangerous conditions in her home. \n173.  With no foster homes available, DHS placed the then one-year-old J.B. in \nthe overcrowded and poorly supervised baby Annex of the Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter in \nOklahoma City.  DHS kept J.B. in the Mayer Emergency Shelter for over thirty consecutive \ndays, until late November of 2007, in violation ofDHS policy and reasonable professional \nstandards limiting shelter stays for children under five years old to a maximum of twenty-four \nhours. \n174.  During DHS's placement of J.B. in the Mayer Emergency Shelter, J.B. \nwas poorly supervised and unmonitored while in a bath, and he suffered severe burns.  After the \nincident occurred, DHS failed to immediately report the suspected abuse or neglect.  J.B. was \ntaken to the hospital where a physician diagnosed J.B. with first- and second-degree burns on \nboth of his feet and reported suspected abuse.  The second-degree burns on J.B.'s left foot were \nso severe that they resulted in the complete loss of his skin from his foot to his toes.  DHS then \nmoved J.B. from the shelter to a temporary foster home where he currently lives while his burns \nheal, after which, DHS plans to move him yet again. \n175.  J.B. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DHS \nduring his time in state custody.  After suffering from severe abuse and numerous placement \nmoves in DHS custody, J.B. is a sixteen-month-old child who, due to DHS's failings, has not had \na single opportunity to form a relationship with a safe, consistent adult caregiver in his entire life. \nDHS has failed to arrange for J.B. to have regular contact with his siblings in order to maintain \ncritical family relationships.  In addition, DHS has failed to provide the services necessary to \nfacilitate J.B.'s prompt and safe reunification with his biological mother or, ifDHS determines \n51 \n\nthat is not appropriate, to seek and secure another permanent home for J.B. through adoption, so \nhe can leave DRS custody.  Instead, J.B. waits indefinitely for a long term placement, at risk of \nbeing moved yet again. \n176.  DRS's policies and practices have caused J.B. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject IB. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DRS has violated J.B. 's \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect him from unnecessary harm and failing \nto keep him reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide him with \na living environment that protects his physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide him with services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing him in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to his individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide him with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that he can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide him with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DRS; keeping him in DRS custody \nlonger than is necessary to accomplish the purposes oftaking him into DRS custody; failing to \nprovide him care, treatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise of \naccepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, \ncontrol and discipline of his DRS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of his \ncurrent status and needs; failing to place him in the least restrictive placement according to his \nneeds; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans that include mandated \nelements; failing to provide appropriate, adequate and timely investigations into suspected abuse \n52 \n\nor neglect while he was in DHS custody; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to \nplacing him in such homes; subjecting him to state-created dangers by placing him on \nunsupervised visits or trial home reunification with family members without taking reasonable \nsteps and providing necessary supervision to ensure his safety; failing to preserve family \nconnections and to facilitate visits with his siblings; and failing to provide him with foster \nplacements that are receiving adequate foster care maintenance payments so that they have the \ncapacity to provide for his essential needs and services. \nA.P. \n177.  DHS has victimized AP. through unsafe placements and numerous \n. moves, the failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to \nprovide required visits from her DHS caseworkers, and the failure to provide services necessary \nto facilitate her prompt and safe reunification with her biological parents or, ifDHS determines \nthat is not appropriate, the failure to seek and secure another permanent home for AP. out of \nstate custody through adoption.  These harms and AP. 's continued instability and risk of harm \nare a direct result ofDHS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to find an appropriate \nplacement for AP. and its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over its \nplacements and over her care. \n178.  AP. entered DHS custody in Rogers County in July of 2006, when she \nwas two years old, along with her four-year-old sister H.P., due to neglect and their mother's \nmental health problems.  DHS first placed AP. and H.P temporarily in an \"emergency foster \nhome\" for two days before moving them to another foster home for a month. \n179.  In October of 2006, DHS directed AP.'s mother to undergo a psychiatric \nevaluation, which found that she was in a severe state of mental health crisis, and in immediate \n53 \n\nneed of services to stabilize her condition and put her on track to possibly resume care of her \ndaughters.  However, DHS never communicated the findings of the evaluation to A.P.' smother \n'. \nand failed to implement the recommendations or provide any services.  As a result, A.P.' s \nmother's mental health condition has significantly deteriorated, and A.P. has been denied the \nopportunity for a possible safe reunification with her mother. \n180.  Instead, DHS removed A.P. and H.P. from their foster home and placed \nthem with their biological father on a trial home reunification, although DHS had not provided \nA.P.' s father with the services necessary to enable him to care for his children.  DHS retained \ncustody of A.P. and H.P. and was required to provide them with supervision, monitoring and \nservices to ensure their safety during the entire trial home reunification period, but failed to do \nso.  A.P.'s DHS caseworker failed to make the required visits to her in her father's home.  As \npart of this placement arrangement, A.P.' s father was not to allow the girls to have any contact \nwith their mother.  However, their mother was, openly, still living in the home, and her untreated \nand deteriorating mental health condition placed A.P. at immediate risk of harm.  After A.P. and \nH.P. had lived in their father's home for seven months, DHS finally removed them from the trial \nhome reunification. \n181.  DHS then placed A.P. and H.P. together in a kinship home in May of \n2007.  Again, DHS failed to supervise and monitor the safety of the placement and the children \nin the home.  In violation ofDHS policy and reasonable professional standards, DHS failed to \nproperly perform the required background checks prior to placing A.P. in the home.  It was only \nafter A.P. had been living in the home that DHS discovered a prior confirmed child abuse \nallegation against the kinship foster parent, rendering the home unsafe.  In addition, H.P. started \nexhibiting highly inappropriate sexual behaviors toward A.P. in this home, consistent with her \n54 \n\nhaving been recently sexually abused, and began to sexually abuse A.P. and other children in the \nhome.  In June of 2007, DHS moved A.P. and H.P. - together  into another foster home, where \nH.P. continued to sexually abuse A.P.  It was not until September of 2007 that DHS fmally \nseparated A.P. from H.P. and moved her to another temporary foster home, where she currently \nlives, likely to be moved yet again. \n182.  A.P. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DHS \nduring her time in state custody.  During A.P.'s eighteen months in DHS custody, DHS has \nalready changed her assigned DHS caseworker five times, due to the excessive turnover in the \nDHS workforce.  DHS has also failed to ensure that A.P. has received required visits from her \ncaseworkers.  DHS has shuffled her among several unsafe placements, and failed to provide the \nservices necessary to facilitate A.P.'s prompt and safe reunification with her biological parents \nor, ifDHS determines that is not appropriate, to seek and secure another permanent home for \nA.P. through adoption, so she can leave DHS custody.  Instead, she waits indefinitely for a long \nterm placement, at risk of being moved yet again. \n183.  DHS's policies and practices have caused A.P. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject A.P. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DHS has violated A.P.'s \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect her from unnecessary harm and failing to \nkeep her reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide her with a \nliving environment that protects her physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide her with services necessary to prevent her from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing her in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to her individual \n55 \n\nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide her with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that she can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide her with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DHS; keeping her in DHS custody \nlonger than is necessary to accomplish the purposes oftaking her into DHS custody; failing to \nprovide her care, treatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise of \naccepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, \ncontrol and discipline of her DHS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of her \ncurrent status and needs; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans that include \nmandated elements; failing to provide appropriate, adequate and timely investigations into \nsuspected abuse or neglect while she was in DHS custody; failing to adequately screen foster \nhomes prior to placing her in such homes; subjecting her to state-created dangers by placing her \non unsupervised visits or trial home reunification with family members without taking \nreasonable steps and providing necessary supervision to ensure her safety; and failing to provide \nher with foster placements that are receiving adequate foster care maintenance payments so that \nthey have the capacity to provide for her essential needs and services. \nJ.A. \n184.  DHS has victimized J.A. through unsafe placements and numerous moves, \nthe failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to arrange \nregular contact with his siblings, and the failure to provide services necessary to facilitate his \nprompt and safe reunification with his biological parents or, ifDHS determines that is not \nappropriate, the failure to seek and secure another permanent home for J.A. out of state custody \nthrough adoption.  These harms and J.A.'s continued instability and risk of harm are the direct \n56 \n\nresult ofDHS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to fmd an appropriate placement for lA. \nand its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over its placements and over his \ncare. \n185.  J.A. entered DHS custody in Oklahoma County in December of 2006, \nwhen he was four years old, due to neglect and his parents' chronic substance abuse problems. \nIn 2002, after lA. and his mother both tested positive for drugs at J.A. 'a birth, DHS requested \nthat J.A. be placed in state custody to ensure his safety.  However, DHS was unable to locate J.A. \nand, instead, placed him on child protective services alert.  It was only in 2006, after J.A.'s \nmother gave birth to another drug-addicted baby, that DHS brought lA. into custody.  With no \nfoster homes available, DHS first placed J.A. in the overcrowded and poorly supervised baby \nAnnex of the Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter for a week, in violation ofDHS policy and \nreasonable professional standards limiting shelter stays for children under five years old to a \nmaximum of twenty-four hours. \n186.  With still no foster homes available, DHS moved J.A. to an \"emergency \nfoster home\" for over a month and then placed him temporarily in a kinship foster home with his \nuncle, without making any effort to determine if his uncle's home could be a long-term \nplacement for J.A.  After lA. had spent six months in the kinship home and developed a \nrelationship with his uncle's family, DHS moved him abruptly to an emergency shelter in Creek \nCounty when his uncle moved out of state with his family.  During the more than six weeks that \nDHS kept J.A. in this emergency shelter, J.A.'s behavior became more disruptive. \n187.  Still lacking placement options, DHS moved J.A. to yet another \nemergency shelter for five days, this time in Cleveland County, and then moved him yet again to \n57 \n\nanother emergency shelter for six weeks, this time in Pittsburgh County.  By this time, DRS had \nkept lA. in three different emergency shelters for ninety consecutive days. \n188.  DRS then moved lA. to a foster home for approximately one month, after \nwhich DRS moved J.A. to an \"emergency foster home\" for one day and then moved him again, \nthis time to a residential treatment facility in Cleveland County.  DRS kept J.A. in this \ninstitutional facility for over a week, after which he was placed in a temporary foster home in \nCanadian County, where he currently lives, likely to be moved yet again. \n189.  J.A. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DRS \nduring his time in state custody.  After a year in DRS custody, J.A. has been shuffled through \nnine different placements, including numerous institutional facilities, without adequate stability, \ntreatment or care from DRS.  DRS has failed to arrange for J.A. to have any visits with his \nsiblings in order to maintain critical family relationships.  In addition, DRS has failed to provide \nthe services necessary to facilitate J.A. 's prompt and safe reunification with his biological \nparents or, if DRS determines that is not appropriate, to seek and secure another permanent home \nfor JA. through adoption, so he can leave DRS custody.  Instead, J.A. waits indefmitely for a \nlong term placement, at risk of being moved yet again. \n190.  DRS's policies and practices have caused J.A. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject lA. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DRS has violated J.A. 's \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect him from unnecessary harm and failing \nto keep him reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide him with \na living environment that protects his physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide him with services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \n58 \n\nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing him in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to his individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide him with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that he can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide him with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DHS; keeping him in DHS custody \nlonger than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of taking him into DHS custody; failing to \nprovide him care, treatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise of \naccepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, \ncontrol and discipline of his DHS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of his \ncurrent status and needs; failing to place him in the least restrictive placement according to his \nneeds; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans that include mandated \nelements; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to placing him in such homes; failing to \npreserve family connections and to facilitate visits with his siblings; and failing to provide him \nwith foster placements that are receiving adequate foster care maintenance payments so that they \nhave the capacity to provide for his essential needs and services. \nJ.P. \n191.  DHS has victimized J.P. through unsafe placements and numerous moves, \nthe failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to provide \nrequired visits from his DHS caseworkers, the failure to arrange regular contact with his siblings, \nthe failure to arrange adequate and basic educational opportunities, the failure to arrange \nconsistent and appropriate mental health services, and the failure to provide services necessary to \nfacilitate his prompt and safe reunification with his biological parents or, ifDHS determines that \n59 \n\nis not appropriate,the failure to seek and secure another pennanent home for J.P. out of state \ncustody through adoption.  These harms and J.P.'s continued instability and risk of harm are a \ndirect result ofDHS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to find an appropriate placement for \nJ.P. and its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over its placements and over his \ncare. \n192.  J.P. entered DHS custody in Oklahoma County in May of 2006, when he \nwas six years old, due to physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence and lack of supervision \nby his aunt, with whom he and his two brothers had been living since his mother was \nincarcerated.  With no foster homes available, DHS first placed J.P. in the overcrowded and \npoorly supervised Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter in Oldahoma City for ten days.  DHS then \nmoved J.P. through three temporary foster homes in six months. \n193.  In November of 2006, DHS placed J.P. in a foster home where he was \nphysically abused by his foster mother for almost a year.  During this time, J.P. did not receive \nrequired visits from his DHS caseworkers to monitor his safety.  In May of2007, although J.P. \ntold his DHS caseworker that his foster mother and her teenage daughter regularly pinned his \narms behind his back and beat him, DHS failed to adequately investigate J.P.'s allegation of \nabuse and kept him in this unsafe home.  It was not until October of2007, when J.P. was brought \nto the hospital with bruises all over his body caused by his foster mother whipping him with a \nbelt, that DHS finally removed him from this home. \n194.  After J.P.'s stay at the hospital, DHS placed him in a respite foster home \nfor five days before placing him in another temporary foster home, where he currently lives, \nlikely to be moved yet again. \n60 \n\n195.  J.P. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DRS \nduring his time in state custody.  After a year and a half in DRS custody, J.P. has suffered from \nabuse and has been shuffled through eight different placements, without adequate stability, \ntreatment or care from DRS.  DRS has failed to arrange for J.P. to have regular visits with his \nbrothers, who are also in DRS custody, in order to maintain critical family relationships. \nAlthough J.P. currently receives multiple psychotropic medications, DRS has failed to arrange \nconsistent and appropriate mental health services for J.P. to address the emotional and \npsychological trauma he has suffered and continues to suffer in DRS custody. \n196.  DRS has also failed to arrange adequate and basic educational \nopportunities for J.P. during his time in DRS custody.  DRS has failed to ensure that J.P.'s \neducational records follow his numerous placement moves.  DRS has caused J.P. to change \nschools numerous times, to miss an unnecessary amount of school, and to fall behind in school, \nwithout any plan or services to give him the educational supports he needs. \n197.  DRS has failed to provide the services necessary to facilitate J.P. 's prompt \nand safe reunification with his biological parents or, if DRS determines that is not appropriate, to \nseek and secure another permanent home for J.P. through adoption, so he can leave DRS \ncustody.  Instead, J.P. waits indefmitely for a long term placement, at risk of being moved yet \nagam. \n198.  DRS's policies and practices have caused J.P. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject J.P. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DRS has violated J.P.'s \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect him from unnecessary harm and failing \nto keep him reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide him with \na living environment that protects his physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \n61 \n\nfailing to provide him with services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing him in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to his individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation ofDHS policy and any reasonable professional \njudgment; failing to provide him with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring \nthat he can leave foster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide him with \ntreatment and care consistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DHS; keeping \nhim in DHS custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of taking him into DHS \ncustody; failing to provide him care, treatment and services, determined and provided through \nthe exercise of accepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate \ninstruction, supervision, control and discipline of his DHS caseworkers; failing to provide \nadequate monitoring of his current status and needs; failing to place him in the least restrictive \nplacement according to his needs; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans \nthat include mandated elements; failing to provide appropriate, adequate and timely \ninvestigations into suspected abuse or neglect while he was in DHS custody; failing to preserve \nfamily connections and to facilitate visits with his siblings; failing to arrange adequate and basic \neducational opportunities; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to placing him in such \nhomes; and failing to provide him with foster placements that are receiving adequate foster care \nmaintenance payments so that they have the capacity to provide for his essential needs and \nservices. \n62 \n\n199.  DHS has victimized R.J. through unsafe placements and numerous moves, \nthe failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to provide \nrequired visits from his DHS caseworkers, the failure to arrange regular contact with his siblings, \nthe failure to arrange adequate and basic educational opportunities, the failure to arrange \nconsistent and appropriate mental health services, the failure to provide services necessary to \nfacilitate his prompt and safe reunification with his biological mother, and the failure to seek and \nsecure another permanent home for R.J. out of state custody through adoption.  These harms and \nR.J.'s continued instability and risk of harm are a direct result ofDHS's drastic placement \nshortage, its failure to find an appropriate placement for R.J. and its failure to provide adequate \nmonitoring and oversight over its placements and over his care. \n200.  R.I. entered DHS custody in Oklahoma County in October of 1999, when \nhe was three years old, due to neglect and sexual abuse perpetrated on R.I.'s sisters by his \nmother's boyfriends.  With no foster homes available, DHS first placed R.J. in the overcrowded \nand poorly supervised Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter.  DHS then moved him through two \n\"emergency foster homes\" in less than a month, followed by a placement in a foster home for \none day, after which DRS moved R.J. yet again. \n201.  Between 2000 and 2002, DHS shuffled R.I. through another five foster \nhomes as his behavior became predictably more difficult due to the constant moves and DHS's \npoor oversight. \n202.  In 2002, DHS placed R.J. and his siblings back in the home of his \nbiological mother on a trial home reunification, although DRS had not provided R.J.' smother \nwith the services necessary to enable her to care for her children.  DHS retained custody ofR.J. \n63 \n\nand was required to provide him with supervision, monitoring and services to ensure his safety \nduring the entire trial home reunification period, but failed to do so.  R.I' s DHS caseworker \nfailed to make the required visits to him in his mother's home.  During the trial home \nreunification, R.I ' s mother continued to use drugs, and she continued to allow men in her home \nwho had a history of sexually abusing children.  In June of 2002, DHS closed the case and \nreturned RI and his siblings to his mother's custody.  R.I.'s mother's home remained unsafe \nand RJ.'s sisters were sexually abused, but it was not until October of2004 that DHS fmally \nremoved R.J. and his siblings due to neglect and abuse. \n203.  Upon re-entering DHS custody, this time in Tulsa County, DHS placed the \nthen eight-year-old R.J. in the Laura Dester Emergency Shelter for two months because of the \ndrastic shortage of foster homes.  DHS then moved R.J. to a temporary foster home for several \nmonths, after which he was again returned to the Laura Dester Emergency Shelter. \n204.  In May of 2005, DHS placed R.I. and one of his siblings in an unsafe, \npoorly supervised and inadequately monitored foster home in Wagoner County.  Rllived in this \nhome for over eighteen months and, during this time, suffered repeated physical abuse as his \nfoster mother regularly beat him with a switch.  In early 2006, DHS fmally removed R.J. from \nthis abusive foster home.  However, with no foster homes available, DHS placed him in an \nemergency shelter in Cherokee County for about one month until, due to overcrowding in that \nshelter, DHS moved him to another emergency shelter in Okmulgee County. \n205.  DHS then moved R.I into a temporary foster home in Tulsa County for \ntwo weeks before placing him back in the Laura Dester Emergency Shelter for three weeks. \nDHS moved R.J. to another temporary foster home for six weeks, after which DHS placed him in \na group home in May of 2007, where he now resides. \n64 \n\n206.  R.1.'s current group home placement is unsafe, poorly monitored, and fails \nto meet R.J.'s needs.  It is located in an old motel near Interstate 1-44, in walking distance of \nseveral seedy bars, strip clubs and truck stops.  The only immediate outdoor space where the \nresident children can play is the cement parking lot outside the group home.  Foster children of \nages five through eighteen are housed together in this home without age or developmentally \nappropriate programs or treatment.  Supervision in the home is so poor, and the conditions in the \nhome so unsanitary and unsafe, that children placed in this home frequently run away from the \nhome for their own safety. \n207.  R.J. is currently separated from all of his six siblings.  R.J.'s brothers \nJ.J.1. (eleven years old), E.H. (ten years old), and J.1. (eight years old) and are in foster care in \nDHS custody and have been adjudicated deprived.  R.J.' s three brothers have been moved by \nDHS through 19, 11 and 17 placements, respectively.  R.J. also has three sisters who are no \nlonger in DHS custody.  DHS has failed to arrange for R.J. to have regular contact with his \nsiblings and the opportunity to maintain critical family relationships while in DHS custody. \n208.  R.J. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DHS \nduring his time in state custody.  While in custody, R.J. has suffered from abuse and has been \nshuffled through more than twenty different placements, including six stays at grossly \ninappropriate emergency shelters, without adequate stability, treatment or care from DHS. \nAlthough R.I. currently receives multiple psychotropic medications, DRS has failed to arrange \nconsistent and appropriate mental health services for R.J. to address the emotional and \npsychological trauma he has suffered and continues to suffer in DHS custody. \n209.  DHS has also failed to arrange adequate and basic educational \nopportunities for R.I. during his time in DHS custody.  DHS has failed to ensure that R.J. 's \n65 \n\neducational records have followed his numerous placement moves.  DHS has caused RJ. to \nchange schools, to miss an unnecessary amount of school, and to fall behind in school, without \nany plan or services to give him the educational supports he needs. \n210.  DHS failed to provide the services necessary to facilitate RJ.'s prompt \nand safe reunification with his biological mother.  The parental rights of RJ.' s parents were not \nterminated until early 2007, making him legally available for adoption.  However, DHS has \nfailed to seek and secure another permanent home for RJ. through adoption, so he can leave \nDHS custody.  Instead, R.J. waits indefmitely for a long term placement, at risk of being moved \nyet again. \n211.  DHS's policies and practices have caused RJ. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject RJ. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DHS has violated R.J.'s \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect him from unnecessary harm and failing \nto keep him reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide him with \na living environment that protects his physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide him with services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing him in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to his individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide him with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that he can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide him with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DHS; keeping him in DHS custody \nlonger than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of taking him into DHS custody; failing to \n66 \n\nprovide him care, treatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise of \naccepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, \ncontrol and discipline of his DRS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of his \ncurrent status and needs; failing to place him in the least restrictive placement according to his \nneeds; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans that include mandated \nelements; failing to provide appropriate, adequate and timely investigations into suspected abuse \nor neglect while he was in DRS custody; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to \nplacing him in such homes; subjecting him to state-created dangers in placing him on \nunsupervised visits or trial home reunification with family members without taking reasonable \nsteps and providing necessary supervision to ensure his safety; failing to preserve family \nconnections and to facilitate visits with his siblings; failing to arrange adequate and basic \neducational opportunities; and failing to provide him with foster placements that are receiving \nadequate foster care maintenance payments so that they have the capacity to provide for his \nessential needs and services. \n212.  DRS has victimized G.C. through unsafe placements and numerous \nmoves, the failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the failure to \nprovide required visits from her DRS caseworkers, the failure to arrange adequate and basic \neducational opportunities, the failure to arrange consistent and appropriate mental health \nservices, the failure to supervise visits with relatives, and the failure to provide services \nnecessary to facilitate her prompt and safe reunification with her biological mother or, if DRS \ndetermines that is not appropriate, the failure to seek and secure another permanent home for \nG.C. out of state custody through adoption.  These harms and G.c. 's continued instability and \n67 \n\nrisk of harm are a direct result of DRS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to find an \nappropriate placement for G.C. and its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over \nits placements and over her care. \n213.  G.C. entered DRS custody in Tulsa County in November of 2003, when \nshe was nine years old, after it was revealed that her stepfather had been sexually abusing her \nsince the age of four and her mother had failed to protect her from the abuse.  With no foster \nhomes available, DRS fIrst placed G.C. in the overcrowded and inadequately supervised Laura \nDester Emergency Shelter in Tulsa for over a month, before moving her to a foster home in \nTulsa County for less than two weeks.  DRS then placed G.C. in a kinship home with her \ngrandfather in Pottawatomie County for over a year, where her step-grandmother frequently \nwhipped her with a leather strap.  DRS moved G.C. from this unsafe and abusive placement to \nanother emergency shelter, this time in Norman, for almost two months, until she was moved to \nanother foster home for four months. \n214.  In June of 2005, DRS placed G.C. on a trial home reunifIcation with her \nbiological mother in Muskogee County, although DRS had not provided G.C.'s mother with the \nservices necessary to enable her to care for her children.  DRS retained custody ofG.C. and was \nrequired to provide her with supervision, monitoring and services to ensure her safety during the \nentire trial home reunifIcation, but failed to do so.  During the fIve months that G.C. was on trial \nhome reunifIcation, G.C.'s \"primary\" DRS caseworker did not visit her at home once, and her \n\"secondary\" DRS caseworker from Muskogee County only saw G.c. a few brief times.  In \nreality, G.C. was living with her aunt in the same home where G.C.'s brothers were living, while \nher biological mother lived separately with a boyfriend who had not undergone a required \nbackground check that would have uncovered his prior history of child abuse.  While living with \n68 \n\nher aunt, G.C. was emotionally abused and threatened with physical abuse by her aunt. \nAdditionally, G.C. suffered an adverse reaction to being placed with her brothers, who strongly \nresembled her stepfather who had sexually abused her for years and whose criminal trial and \nconviction for that sexual abuse had just come to a close.  As a result of this trauma, G.C. had to \nbe hospitalized for more than a month, and she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress \nDisorder and Reactive Attachment Disorder. \n215.  After her hospitalization, at the end of2005, DHS placed G.C. in a foster \nhome in Rogers County where she remained for a year, and developed a relationship with her \nfoster parents.  G.C.'s \"primary\" DHS caseworker did not visit her in this home for four months, \nand her \"secondary\" caseworker from Rogers County only made a few brief visits.  While in this \nplacement, DHS allowed G.C. to have unsupervised visits with her biological mother and her \nboyfriend, who still had not undergone a required background check.  DHS allowed these \nunsupervised visits to continue for over six months. \n216.  In the fall of2006, DHS performed a home study to quality G.C.'s uncle \nand his wife as kinship foster parents for G.C.  However, the home was disqualified due to \nunsafe and unsanitary conditions, including trash, beer cans and dirty diapers all over the front \nlawn, dog feces throughout the inside of the house, and exposed wires and holes in the walls \ninside the house.  Nevertheless, a month later, DHS deemed this same home suitable for G.c. to \nhave unsupervised overnight visits with her uncle and his family.  During the first unsupervised \nweekend visit, G.C. was forced to clean dog feces throughout the house, and her uncle hit her on \nher knee, causing a serious bruise, as a warning not to speak up about the conditions in the home. \nDuring the second unsupervised visit to her uncle's home, G.C.'s aunt brought over G.C.'s \n69 \n\nbrothers, despite the trauma G.C. had suffered the last time she was placed with them.  G.C. was \ntold by her uncle not to tell anyone that she had seen her siblings. \n217.  Following the unsupervised weekend visits with her uncle and his family, \nG.C. reported suicidal ideations while at school and began to have flashbacks of her sexual \nabuse.  As a result, in February of 2007, DHS placed G.C. at an inpatient facility for two months \nin a program that was overly restrictive and unsafe.  Although G.C. was to be monitored on a 24-\nhour basis at the facility to ensure her safety and well-being, during this time, she was sexually \nassaulted by a male resident.  DHS failed to investigate the assault.  Not surprisingly, G.C. 's \nbehavior significantly deteriorated during her inpatient stay. \n218.  In April of 2007, DHS placed G.C. temporarily in the same foster home in \nRogers County that she had been placed in prior to her hospitalization, but she was moved again \nseveral months later. \n219.  Since August of 2007, DHS has moved G.C. among five different foster \nhomes, several of which were more than one hundred miles from Tulsa, including one \novercrowded foster home with seven other children and a foster parent on dialysis.  DHS has \nconsistently failed to provide G.C. 's foster parents with necessary information on G.C. 's \nbackground, medical history and current needs.  In addition, although DHS is aware that, due to \nG.C.'s history, she needs to be placed in a home with no other foster children, DHS continues to \nplace her in homes with older children, accelerating the cycle of placement disruptions and \ntransitions.  With each new move, G.C. experiences increased feelings of detachment and \nrejection, a greater sense of instability and worsening psychological trauma.  As a result, G .C. \nhas begun self-mutilating and her behavior has deteriorated. \n70 \n\n220.  In January of 2008, DRS moved O.C. to the same institutional facility \nwhere she had previously been sexually assaulted.  G.C. remains in this overly restrictive and \nunsafe facility today, inadequately monitored and deteriorating in custody. \n221.  G.C. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DRS \nduring her time in state custody.  While in custody, O.C. has suffered both physical and sexual \nabuse and has been shuflled through at least fifteen different placements all over the state, \nwithout adequate stability, treatment or care from DRS.  Although O.C. currently receives \nmultiple psychotropic medications, DRS has failed to arrange consistent and appropriate mental \nhealth services for O.C. to address the emotional and psychological trauma she has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer in DRS custody.  In addition, DRS has failed to provide G.C. with consistent, \nneeded therapy to address the sexual abuse she has suffered. \n222.  DRS has failed to arrange adequate and basic educational opportunities for \nO.C. during her time in DRS custody.  DRS has failed to ensure that O.C.'s educational records \nhave followed her numerous placement moves.  DRS has caused O.C. to change schools, to miss \nan unnecessary amount of school, and to fall behind in school, without any plan or services to \ngive her the educational supports she needs. \n223.  DRS has failed to provide the services necessary to facilitate G.C.'s \nprompt and safe reunification with her biological mother or, if DRS determines that is not \nappropriate, to seek and secure another permanent home for G.c. through adoption, so she can \nleave DHS custody.  Instead, O.c. waits indefinitely for a long term placement, at risk of being \nmoved yet again. \n224.  DRS's policies and practices have caused O.C. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject O.C. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DHS has violated G.C.'s \n71 \n\nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect her from unnecessary harm and failing to \nkeep her reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide her with a \nliving environment that protects her physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide her with services necessary to prevent her from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing her in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to her individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide her with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that she can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide her with treatment and care \nconsistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DRS; keeping her in DRS custody \nlonger than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of taking her into DRS custody; failing to \nprovide her care, treatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise of \naccepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, supervision, \ncontrol and discipline of her DRS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate monitoring of her \ncurrent status and needs; failing to place her in the least restrictive placement according to her \nneeds; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans that include mandated \nelements; failing to provide appropriate, adequate and timely investigations into suspected abuse \nor neglect while she was in DRS custody; failing to adequately screen foster homes prior to \nplacing her in such homes; subjecting her to state-created dangers in placing her on unsupervised \nvisits or trial home reunification with family members without taking reasonable steps and \nproviding necessary supervision to ensure her safety; failing to arrange adequate and basic \neducational opportunities; and failing to provide her with foster placements that are receiving \n72 \n\nadequate foster care maintenance payments so that they have the capacity to provide for her \nessential needs and services. \n225.  DHS has subjected K.T. to further harm through unsafe placements and \nnumerous moves, the failure to provide stable and safe care from a consistent adult caregiver, the \nfailure to provide required visits from her DHS caseworkers, the failure to arrange regular \ncontact with her sibling, the failure to arrange special education services, the failure to arrange \nconsistent and appropriate mental health services, the failure to supervise visits with her \nbiological father, the failure to provide required services to enable her to live independently \nwhen she turns eighteen, and the failure to seek and secure a permanent home for K.T. out of \nstate custody through adoption.  These harms and K. T.' s continued instability and risk of harm \nare a direct result ofDHS's drastic placement shortage, its failure to find an appropriate and \npermanent placement for K.T. and its failure to provide adequate monitoring and oversight over \nits placements and over her care. \n226.  K.T. entered DHS custody in Oklahoma City in May of 1997, when she \nwas six years old, due to physical and sexual abuse by her father and extreme neglect.  With no \nfoster homes available, DHS ftrst placed K.T. in the overcrowded and poorly supervised Pauline \nMayer Emergency Shelter in Oklahoma City before moving her to an \"emergency foster home\" \nfor a month.  DHS then placed her in two separate kinship placements over the next year, before \nmoving her back to the Pauline Mayer Emergency Shelter in June of 1998. DHS kept her in the \nshelter for six weeks, although she was only seven years old at the time.  At this point, DHS had \nalready moved K.T. through five placements in her first year in custody, and her behavior \npredictably became more disruptive. \n73 \n\n227.  During this time, DRS allowed KT. dangerous unsupervised weekend \nvisitation with her biological father who had sexually abused her.  DRS placed K.T. at great risk \nof harm by allowing these visits.  The visits fmally ceased when KT. reported that there was no \nfood in her father's home, that her father and his girlfriend had engaged in inappropriate sexual \nbehavior in front of her and that her father had invited her mother - who had relinquished her \nparental rights - to spend time with KT. during these visits. \n228.  Over the next eight years, DRS moved KT. through numerous foster \nhomes and inpatient facilities, often without receiving the required visits from her DRS \ncaseworker or appropriate monitoring over her care and her placements.  KT. was diagnosed \nwith ADHD and Reactive Attachment Disorder and was prescribed multiple psychotropic \nmedications to control her behavior during this time; however, DRS failed to arrange consistent, \nneeded therapy and mental health treatment for KT.  DRS also failed to provide KT. \nspecialized placements to address her developmental delays.  These failures by DRS caused K.T. \nto further deteriorate in custody. \n229.  DRS then placed KT. in two separate emergency shelters over the span of \ntwo weeks in April of 2006 before placing her in an unsafe, poorly monitored and inadequately \nsupervised group home in Lawton for over a year.  This group home did not have any specialized \nstaff or programs for KT.'s developmental delays and she received none of the attention and \nspecialized supports that she requires. \n230.  In June of 2007, DRS moved KT. to another unsafe, poorly monitored \nand inadequately supervised group home in Tulsa.  This group home is located in an old motel \nnear Interstate 1-44, in walking distance of several seedy bars, strip clubs and truck stops.  The \nonly immediate outdoor space where the resident children can play is the cement parking lot \n74 \n\noutside the group home.  Foster children ages five through eighteen are housed together in this \nhome without age or developmentally appropriate programs or treatment.  The home does not \nhave any specialized staff or programs for K. T. 's developmental delays and she receives none of \nthe attention and specialized supports she requires.  Supervision in the home is so poor, and the \nconditions in the home so unsanitary and unsafe, that children placed in this home frequently run \naway from the home for their own safety.  Yet K T. remains in this inappropriate and dangerous \ngroup home today, inadequately monitored and further deteriorating. \n231.  KT. has received dangerously poor monitoring and oversight from DRS \nduring her time in state custody.  After spending the past ten years in DRS custody, KT. has \nbeen shuffled through more than twenty placements  many of them unsafe, inappropriate and \ninadequately supervised - without adequate stability, treatment or care from DRS. DRS has \nseparated KT. from her brother, who is also in DRS custody, and has failed to arrange for K.T. \nto have regular visits with him in order to maintain critical family relationships.  Currently, \nalthough KT. still receives multiple psychotropic medications, DRS has failed to arrange \nconsistent and appropriate mental health services for K.T. to address the emotional and \npsychological trauma she has suffered and continues to suffer in DRS custody. \n232.  Although KT. is now sixteen years old and eligible for independent living \nservices, DRS has failed to provide her with required services to prepare her to live on her own \nwhen she turns 18 and is discharged from DRS custody, a failure made even more dangerous by \nKT. 's developmental delays. \n233.  DRS has also failed to arrange special education services for KT. during \nher time in DRS custody.  DHS has failed to ensure that KT.'s educational records follow her \nnumerous placement moves.  DHS has caused K.T. to change schools numerous times, to miss \n75 \n\nan unnecessary amount of school, and to fall behind in school, without any plan or services to \ngive her the special educational supports she needs. \n234.  DRS failed to provide the services necessary to facilitate KT.'s prompt \nand safe reunification with her biological parents.  Although the parental rights ofKT.'s parents \nwere terminated by 2000, DRS has failed to seek and secure another permanent home for K.T. \nthrough adoption, so she can leave DRS custody.  DRS's permanency goal for KT. is long term \nfoster care, and KT. waits indefmitely for a long term placement, at risk of being moved yet \nagain. \n235.  DRS's policies and practices have caused K.T. irreparable harm and \ncontinue to subject KT. to the imminent risk of irreparable harm.  DRS has violated KT.'s \nconstitutional and statutory rights by:  failing to protect her from unnecessary harm and failing to \nkeep her reasonably safe from harm while in government custody; failing to provide her with a \nliving environment that protects her physical, mental and emotional safety and well-being; \nfailing to provide her with services necessary to prevent her from deteriorating or being harmed \nphysically, psychologically or emotionally while in government custody, including the right to \nsafe and secure foster placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision; placing her in \nemergency shelters or other emergency, temporary placements that are contrary to her individual \nneeds and for extended periods, in violation of any reasonable professional judgment; failing to \nprovide her with appropriate planning and services directed toward ensuring that she can leave \nfoster care and grow up in a permanent family; failing to provide her with a plan or services to \nenable her to live independently when she turns eighteen; failing to provide her with treatment \nand care consistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DRS; keeping her in DRS \ncustody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of taking her into DRS custody; \n76 \n\nfailing to provide her care, treatment, and services, determined and provided through the exercise \nof accepted, reasonable professional judgment; failing to provide adequate instruction, \nsupervision, control and discipline of her DRS caseworkers; failing to provide adequate \nmonitoring of her current status and needs; failing to place her in the least restrictive placement \naccording to her needs; failing to develop and implement timely written case plans that include \nmandated elements; failing to provide appropriate, adequate and timely investigations into \nsuspected abuse or neglect while she was in DRS custody; failing to adequately screen foster \nhomes prior to placing her in such homes; subjecting her to state-created dangers in placing her \non unsupervised visits or trial home reunification with family members without taking \nreasonable steps and providing necessary supervision to ensure her safety; failing to preserve \nfamily connections and to facilitate visits with her sibling; failing to arrange adequate and basic \neducational opportunities; and failing to provide her with foster placements that are receiving \nadequate foster care maintenance payments so that they have the capacity to provide for her \nessential needs and services. \nVIll.  Causes of Action \nFirst Cause of Action \n(Substantive Due Process Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution) \n236.  Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorporated herein as if fully \nset forth. \n237.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution to protect a child from harm when it takes that child into its foster \ncare custody. \n77 \n\n238.  The foregoing policies and practices of Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, constitute a failure to \nmeet the affirmative duty to protect from harm and to keep reasonably free from harm all Named \nPlaintiffs and Plaintiff Children, which is a substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause of, \nthe violation of the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all Named Plaintiffs \nand Plaintiff Children. \n239.  The foregoing policies and practices of Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, constitute a policy, \npattern, custom and/or practice that shocks the conscience, is outside the exercise of any \nprofessional judgment and amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally protected \nrights and liberty and privacy interests of all Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children.  As a result, \nall Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children have been harmed and are at continuing and imminent \nrisk of harm, and have been deprived of the substantive due process rights guaranteed by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n240.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to:  the \nright to protection from unnecessary harm and to be reasonably safe from harm while in \ngovernment custody; the right to a living environment that protects Plaintiff Children's physical, \nmental and emotional safety and well-being; the right to services necessary to prevent Plaintiff \nChildren from deteriorating or being harmed physically, psychologically or otherwise while in \ngovernment custody, including but not limited to the right to safe and secure foster care \nplacements, appropriate monitoring and supervision, appropriate planning and services directed \ntoward ensuring that Plaintiff Children can leave foster care and grow up in a permanent family; \nthe right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose of the assumption of custody by DHS; \n78 \n\nthe right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of \ntaking Plaintiff Children into custody; the right to receive care, treatment and services, \ndetermined and provided through the exercise of accepted, reasonable professional judgment; the \nright to be placed in the least restrictive placement according to Plaintiff Children's needs; the \nright to appropriate, adequate and timely investigations of allegations of abuse or neglect; the \nright to adequate instruction, supervision, control and discipline of caseworkers; the right not to \nbe placed in overcrowded or dangerous foster homes or facilities; the right to adequate screening \nof foster care homes and other placement providers prior to placement; the right to adequate \nmonitoring of the current status and needs of Plaintiff Children; and the right not to be subjected \nto state-created dangers in the placement of Plaintiff Children still in DHS custody on visits or \ntrial home reunification placements with their biological parents or family members. \nSecond Cause of Action \n(First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution) \n241.  Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorporated as if fully set \nforth herein. \n242.  The foregoing policies and practices of the Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, constitute a failure to \nexercise an affirmative duty to protect the welfare of all Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children, \nwhich failure is a substantial factor leading to, and a proximate cause of, violation of the \nconstitutionally protected liberty interests, privacy interests and associational rights of all ofthe \nNamed Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children. \n243.  The foregoing policies and practices of the Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, amount to a policy, \n79 \n\npattern, custom and/or practice that is outside the exercise of any professional judgment and \namounts to deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' constitutional rights.  As a result, Named \n. Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children are being deprived of their liberty interest, privacy interests and \nassociational rights conferred on them by the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution not to be deprived of a child-parent or a child-sibling family \nrelationship. \nThird Cause of Action \n(The Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., \n670 et seq.) \n244.  Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorporated herein as if fully \nset forth. \n245.  Under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended \nby the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997,42 U.S.C. §§ 62l-629(i), 670-679b (collectively, \nthe \"Adoption Assistance Act\"), states receive certain federal reimbursements so long as they \nenter into a plan approved by the federal Department of Health and Human Services and comply \nwith its terms.  Oklahoma receives federal funding under the Adoption Assistance Act and has \nsubmitted and entered into such a plan, which is a legal contract between the federal government \nand the State, thereby agreeing to provide child welfare services in accordance with the Adoption \nAssistance Act. \n246.  The foregoing policies and practices by Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, constitute a policy, \npattern, custom and/or practice of depriving all Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children of rights \nconferred on them by the Adoption Assistance Act and the regulations promUlgated thereunder, \n45 C.F.R. §§ 1355-57. These rights include but are not limited to:  the right to timely written \n80 \n\ncase plans containing mandated elements, and to a case review system to ensure the \nimplementation of these plans; the right to have a petition to terminate parental rights filed, or \nhave a compelling reason documented why such a petition has not been filed, in accordance with \nspecified, statutory standards and time frames; the right of Plaintiff Children whose permanency \ngoal is adoption to planning and services to obtain a permanent placement, including \ndocumentation of the steps taken to secure permanency; the right to services that protect Plaintiff \nChildren's safety and health; the right to have health and educational records reviewed, updated \nand supplied to foster parents or foster care providers with whom the Plaintiff Child is placed at \nthe time of placement; and the right of Plaintiff Children to live in foster placements that have \nthe capacity to provide for their essential needs and services by receiving adequate foster care \nmaintenance payments that cover the actual cost of (and the cost of providing) the Plaintiff \nChild's food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies, reasonable travel to visitation \nwith family and other expenses.  42 U.S.c. §§ 622(b)(8)(A)(ii)-(iii), 622(b)(15), \n629a(a)(l)(A)(i)-(ii), 629a(a)(7)-(8), 671(a)(l), 671(a)(II), 671(a)(16), 671(a)(22), 672(a)-(c), \n675(1), 675(4)(A), 675(5)(A), 675(5)(D)-(E); 45 C.F.R. §§ 1355.20, 1355.25, 1356.21(f)-(g), \n1356.21 (i), 1356.21(m), 1357.10(c)(4)-(6). \nFourth Cause of Action \n(Procedural Due Process Under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution) \n247.  Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorporated as if fully set \nforth herein. \n248.  The foregoing policies and practices of Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices of DHS, constitute a failure to \nexercise an affirmative duty to protect the welfare of all Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children, \n81 \n\nwhich is a substantial factor leading to, and a proximate cause of, the violation of the \nconstitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all of the Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff \nChildren. \n249.  The foregoing policies and practices of the Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, constitute a policy, \npattern, custom and/or practice of failing to exercise any reasonable professional judgment and \nof deliberate indifference to the constitutionally protected liberty and property interests of \nNamed Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children.  As a result, Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children \nhave been and are being harmed and deprived of both federal and state-created liberty or \nproperty rights without due process of law. \n250.

Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorporated as if fully set \nforth herein. \n253.  Under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act, states receive \ncertain federal monies so long as they enter into plans approved by HHS and comply with their \nterms.  Oklahoma receives federal funding under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act \nand has submitted such State Plans to the federal government, which are legal contracts between \nthe federal government and the State, and such plans have been approved.  In these State Plan \ncontracts, the State agrees to provide child welfare, foster care, and adoption services to \nPlaintiffs in accordance with specific statutes, regulations, and policies and all applicable federal \nregulations and other official issuances of the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices. \n254.  The foregoing policies and practices of Defendants, who directly and \nindirectly control and are responsible for the polices and practices ofDHS, have breached and \ncontinue to breach their obligations under Oklahoma's State Plan contracts, and all Plaintiffs, as \nthe intended direct third-party beneficiaries to these State Plan contracts, are (i) being denied \ntheir rights under law to the services and benefits that the State of Oklahoma is obligated to \nprovide to them under such contracts, and (ii) being harmed thereby. \n84 \n\nIX.  Prayer for Relief \n255.  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff Children respectfully request that this \nHonorable Court: \na.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \nb.  Order that Plaintiff Children may maintain this action as a class \naction pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) ofthe Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure; \nc.  Declare unconstitutional and unlawful pursuant to Rule 57 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure: \n1.  Defendants' violation of Plaintiff Children's rights under \nthe Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; \nn.  Defendants' violation of Plaintiff Children's rights under \nthe First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution; \niii.  Defendants' violation of Plaintiff Children's rights under \nthe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,42 \nU.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq.; \niv.  Defendants' violation of Plaintiff Children's right to \nprocedural due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution; and \nv.  Defendants' breach of their contractual obligations to \nPlaintiff Children under the State of Oklahoma's Title IV-E \nand Title IV-B state plans; \nd.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiff Children \nto practices that violate their rights; \ne.  . Order appropriate remedial relief tailored to the evidence proven to \nthe Court in order to ensure Defendants' future compliance with \ntheir legal obligations to Plaintiff Children; \nf.

It is AGREED by the parties that:\n(a) Circumstances neither foreseen nor contemplated by the Parties\nduring the drafting and signing of the Settlement Agreement have\ncreated conditions that significantly hamper the Department’s efforts\nto positively impact the data metrics for certain performance areas.\nThe continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically\nhindered both the Department’s activities and efforts as well as those\nof external parties upon which the Department depends to achieve\nsubstantial and sustained progress.\n(b) Until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Oklahoma child\nfoster  care  system  is  more  fully  understood,  addressed,  and\nameliorated, the Parties seek to hold in abeyance during a “COVID\nRecovery Period” the twice annual determinations of the Co-Neutrals\nwhether the Department has engaged in good faith efforts to achieve\nsubstantial  and  sustained  progress  with  regard  to  the  following\nPerformance Area Measures (hereafter, collectively referred to as\n“Delayed Performance Area Measures”):\n1 \nEXHIBIT 1\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM   Document 908-1 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 12/13/21   Page 2 of 6\n(i) TFC Performance Area Measure 2.B: Number of new\ntherapeutic foster homes (TFC) reported by DHS as\napproved for the reporting period;\n(ii) TFC Performance Area Measure Net Gain/Loss in TFC\nhomes for the reporting period;\n(iii) Permanency  Performance  Area  Measure  6.2a:  The\nnumber and percent of children who entered foster\ncare 12-18 months prior to the end of the reporting\nperiod  who  reach  permanency  within  one  year  of\nremoval, by type of permanency;\n(iv) Permanency  Performance  Area  Measure  6.2b:  The\nnumber and percent of children who entered their 12th\nmonth in foster care between 12-18 months prior to the\nend of the reporting period who reach permanency\nwithin two years of removal, by type of permanency;\n(v) Permanency  Performance  Area  Measure  6.2c:  The\nnumber and percent of children who entered their 24th\nmonth in foster care between 12-18 months prior to the\nend of the reporting period who reach permanency\nwithin three years of removal, by type of permanency;\n(vi) Permanency  Performance  Area  Measure  6.2d:  The\nnumber and percent of children who entered their 36th\nmonth in foster care between 12-18 months, prior to\nthe end of the reporting period who reach permanency\nwithin four years of removal;\n(vii) Permanency Performance Area Measure 6.4: Among\nlegally free foster youth who turned 16 in the period 24\nto 36 months prior to the report date, the percent that\nexited to permanency by age 18; stayed in foster care\nafter age 18, and exited without permanency by age\n18.\n(c) All remaining Performance Area Measures will not be impacted by or\notherwise  subject  to  the  COVID  Recovery  Period  (hereafter,\ncollectively  referred  to  as  “Non-Impacted  Performance  Area\nMeasures”).\n(d) During the COVID Recovery Period, the Co-Neutrals will continue to\nprovide  Technical  Assistance  as  well  as  validate,  report,  and\ncomment upon the performance of the Department and its trending\nfor all Performance Area data as it pertains to Delayed Performance\nArea Measures.

Upon resumption of Good Faith\nAssessments and after Delayed Performance Area Measures have\ncollectively  achieved  two  successive  years  of  Good  Faith\nAssessments,  they  will  no  longer  be  subject  to  any  validation,\nreporting, comment, or Good Faith Assessment by the Co-Neutrals.\n(c) Because of the continuing uncertainties posed by COVID 19, the\nParties further agree to assess and negotiate in good faith and\ndetermine whether the reporting period in which the Co-Neutrals\nresume  their  Good  Faith  determinations  of  these  Delayed\nPerformance Area Measures should be further altered.\n3 \nEXHIBIT 1\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM   Document 908-1 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 12/13/21   Page 4 of 6\n(d)  Should  the  Department  continue  to  achieve  Good  Faith \nAssessments  by  the  Co-Neutrals  for  Commentaries  Seventeen, \nEighteen, and Nineteen as to the Non-Impacted Performance Area \nMeasures,  those  Measures  will  no  longer  be  subject  to  any \nvalidation, reporting, comment, or Good Faith Assessment by the \nCo-Neutrals.

[Doc. 2].  This \ncourt certified a class of plaintiffs more specifically described as follows:  \nAll children who are or will be in the legal custody of the Oklahoma Department \nof Human Services (1) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect; or (2) who \nare or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.   \n \n[Doc. 272].  The Plaintiff Class and the Oklahoma Department of Human Services subsequently \nreached a Compromise and Settlement Agreement, which this court approved by virtue of an Order \nand Judgment dated February 29, 2012.  [Doc. 778 and Doc. 779].   \n \n1 John Schneider is automatically substituted as a part pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n25(d). \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-fhm   Document 910 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 04/24/23   Page 2 of 3\n  Pursuant to the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, Kathleen G. Noonan, Kevin M. \nRyan, and Eileen Crummy were appointed as “Co-Neutrals,” who were charged with, twice \nannually,  providing  commentary  as  to  the  Department’s  overall  progress  and  whether  the \nDepartment is making good faith efforts pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  [Doc. 770-1, pp. \n5 and 11].  To that end, the Co-Neutrals and Department established the Metrics, Baselines, and \nTargets Plan for various performance areas.   \nThe Settlement Agreement provided that, on December 15, 2016, the Co-Neutrals should \nissue a final report, to include a finding that the Department has, or has not, made good faith efforts \nto achieve substantial and sustained progress toward Target Outcomes.  [Doc. 770-1, pp. 11-12].  \nIn the final report,  \n[i]f the Co-Neutrals find that the Department has made, for a continuous period of \nat least two years prior to December 15, 2016, good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  each  Target  Outcome,  then  the \nDepartment’s obligations under th[e] Settlement Agreement shall terminate and the \nparties shall jointly seek to vacate any Judgment entered by the Court as a result of \na finding or decision by the Co-Neutrals.  \n \n[Doc. 770-1, p. 12].   \n  On September 2, 2016, the parties agreed to amend the Compromise and Settlement \nAgreement to suspend the Co-Neutrals’ issuance of a final report.  Instead, the amendment \npermitted the Department to request a Final Report from the Co-Neutrals at any time.    \nOn December 14, 2021, the court granted the parties Joint Motion to Modify Settlement \nAgreement as set forth in the Agreement to Amend the Compromise and Settlement Agreement \nand Partially Suspend Good Faith Reporting on Selected Performance Area Measures, referred to \nas the COVID Recovery Agreement.  [Doc. 908-1; Doc. 909].  Under the COVID Recovery \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-fhm   Document 910 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 04/24/23   Page 3 of 3\nAgreement, the parties agreed to hold in abeyance during the “COVID Recovery Period”2 the \ntwice annual determinations by the Co-Neutral as to whether DHS had engaged in good faith \nefforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress for seven performance area measures, known \nas the “Delayed Performance Area Measures.”  All other performance area measures were referred \nto as the “Non-Impacted Performance Area Measures.”   \nOn  March  22,  2023,  the  Co-Neutrals  issued  the  Nineteenth  Commentary,  the  first \nCommentary  following  the  COVID  Recovery  Period.    With  respect  to  the  Non-Impacted \nPerformance Areas, the Co-Neutrals found that the Department has fulfilled the Compromise and \nSettlement  Agreement’s  requirement  for  a  two-year  continuous  period  of  good  faith \ndeterminations.  Thus, the Nineteenth Commentary serves as the Final Report for the Non-\nImpacted Performance Area Measures.   \nThe Compromise and Settlement Agreement provides a thirty-day period for the parties to \nappeal to the court the Final Report of the Co-Neutrals.  [Doc. 770-1, p. 12].  The thirty-day period \nhas lapsed and no appeal has been filed.  Thus, the Nineteenth Commentary of the Co-Neutrals \nconstitutes the Final Report for the twenty-three Non-Impacted Performance Area Measures.  The \nDepartment’s obligations under the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, as amended, with \nrespect to the twenty-three “Non-Impacted Performance Areas Measures” are terminated.  See \n[Doc. 770-1, p. 12].  \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 24th day of April, 2023. \n \n \n \n2 The “COVID Recovery Period” included the following:  (1) January 1, 2021 through June 30, \n2021; (ii) July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021; and (iii) January 1, 2022 through June 30, \n2022.

In support of the instant Motion, the Parties show the \nCourt as follows: \n1.  The Parties are in agreement that circumstances not envisioned during the negotiation and \nsettlement of the associated litigation (specifically, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) \nhave deleteriously impacted Defendants’ good faith efforts to achieve the substantial and \nsustained progress desired by all the Parties as it pertains to specific Performance Area \nMeasures called for in the Agreement. \n2.  As a result of good faith negotiations and subsequent agreement, Counsel for the Parties, \nwith the understanding and approval of the Monitors, i.e., Co-Neutrals, hereby submit to \nthis Court the attached proposed modification to the Agreement (Exhibit 1) which takes \ninto account the impact of the COVID pandemic. \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM   Document 908 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 12/13/21   Page 2 of 4\n3.  More specifically, counsel for the Parties, with understanding and approval from the Co-\nNeutrals, have agreed to temporarily hold the good faith determinations of the Co-Neutrals \nin abeyance as to specifically identified Performance Area Measures during what the \nParties have identified as a COVID Recovery Period.  Further, subject to additional agreed \nupon terms, the Parties are seeking to bifurcate the submission of a Final Report by the Co-\nNeutrals to differentiate between those Measures subject to the COVID Recovery Period \nand those not subject to the COVID Recovery Period. \n4.  This constitutes the second joint modification to this Settlement Agreement. The previous \njoint modification was finalized in September of 2016. \n5.  Counsel for the Parties jointly present to this Court their good faith belief that the proposed \nModification is in the best interest of the Class members, the Department of Human \nServices, and the State of Oklahoma. \n6.  This Modification is intended to incorporate and amend the original Agreement as well as \nthe  first  modification  in  2016.    Further,  it  is  intended  that  this  Modification  will \nsupplement, not supplant, the Agreement or the prior modification.  Unless otherwise noted \nin  the  proposed,  attached  modification,  all  definitions,  obligations,  and  terms  and \nconditions in the Agreement and prior modification remain in force for the terms of the \nAgreement. \n7.  Pursuant to this Court’s Judgment in the above-referenced case and in accordance with \n§3.2 of the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, this Court retains jurisdiction in this \nmatter and its approval of this Modification is appropriate. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM   Document 908 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 12/13/21   Page 3 of 4\nRELIEF REQUESTED \n  Accordingly, counsel for the Parties jointly seek the approval of this Court to Modify the \nCompromise and Settlement Agreement (Exhibit 1) in the above-referenced case. \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n           s/ Ronald Baze          \n            Ronald Baze (OBA #19634) \n            General Counsel \n            Department of Human Services \n            P.

The Oklahoma Commission for Human Services is the body\nresponsible for formulating the policies and adopting the rules and regulations for\nthe administration of the OKDHS.  In their complaint, Named Plaintiffs sought\ncertification of a class of all children who are or will be in the legal custody of\nOKDHS due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect or who are or will be\nadjudicated  deprived  due  to  abuse  or  neglect—approximately  10,000  children.\nNamed Plaintiffs allege OKDHS’s agency-wide foster care policies and practices\nexpose all class members to an impermissible risk of harm, violating their Fourteenth\nAmendment right to substantive due process, their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights to procedural due process, and their liberty and privacy interests guaranteed\nby the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Specifically, Named Plaintiffs\nassert  OKDHS’s  agency-wide  deficiencies  include:  (1)  failing  to  protect  class\nmembers from abuse and neglect while in OKDHS custody; (2) failing to protect\nclass members from abuse or neglect by their biological parents while in OKDHS\ncustody; (3) assigning excessive caseloads to its child welfare caseworkers and\nsupervisors;  (4)  engaging  in  dangerous  monitoring  and  oversight  practices;  (5)\nplacing class members in unsafe and overcrowded emergency shelters; (6) placing\n2\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 4\nclass members in unsafe foster homes as a result of failing to develop sufficient\nnumbers of safe placements; (7) maintaining policies and practices that deny class\nmembers opportunities to develop critical family relationships; and (8) maintaining\npolicies and practices that subject class members to harmful moves among multiple\ninappropriate homes and facilities.   \nWhen Named Plaintiffs filed their complaint seeking class certification in\nFebruary 2008, the parties did not have the benefit of our decisions in Shook v.\nBoard of County Commissioners, 543 F.3d 597 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Shook II”), and\nVallario v. Vandehey, 554 F.3d 1259 (10th Cir. 2009), which explain the proper\nstandards for class certification when plaintiffs seek injunctive relief.  In light of\nShook II, the district court allowed Named Plaintiffs to supplement their motion for\nclass certification by submitting a statement of relief sought and then ordered both\nparties to submit briefs addressing whether a class action seeking the relief requested\nby  Named  Plaintiffs  would  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Federal  Rules  of  Civil\nProcedure 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 65(d) as explained in Shook II.\nAfter reviewing Named Plaintiffs’ nine alleged common questions of fact, five\nalleged common questions of law, and seven requested remedies, as well as both\nparties’ supplemental briefs, the district court certified the proposed class.  The\ndistrict court found the proposed class met Rule 23(a)(1)’s numerosity requirement\nand Rule 23(a)(4)’s adequacy of class representation requirement.  Neither party\ndisputes the class meets those requirements.  The district court also explained in a\n3\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 5\nthorough and careful order that at least one question of fact and one question of law\nwere common to the class, satisfying Rule 23(a)’s commonality requirement.   Based\non the evidence submitted by the parties, the district court concluded “[w]hether\n[OK]DHS has a policy or practice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of class\nmembers causing significant harm and risk of harm to their safety, health and well-\nbeing” presents an issue of fact common to the entire class.  According to the court,\nthis  common  question  of  fact  raised  one  common  issue  of  law:    “[W]hether\n[OK]DHS’s policies or practices violate class members’ right to be reasonably free\nfrom harm and imminent risk of harm while in state custody.”  The court then\nconcluded because Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class’s claims and\nNamed Plaintiffs’ claims are not significantly antagonistic to the class, the class\nsatisfied Rule 23(a)’s typicality requirement.  Finally, the court determined at least\ntwo of Named Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies—(1) an injunction setting limits on the\ncaseloads  of  caseworkers  and  their  supervisors  assigned  to  the  class  based  on\nCouncil on Accreditation (COA) and Child Welfare League of America (CWLA)\nstandards and (2) an injunction requiring caseworkers to visit all children in OKDHS\ncustody as frequently as set forth under COA and CWLA standards—satisfy Rule\n23(b)(2) and 65(d)’s requirements as explained in Shook II.  \nWe granted Defendants’ timely request for permission to file an interlocutory\nappeal of the district court’s order granting class certification.  Defendants argue the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by erroneously finding the proposed class satisfied\n4\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 6\nRule 23(a)’s commonality and typicality requirements.  They also assert the district\ncourt erred in concluding the proposed class satisfied Rule 23(b)(2)’s “generally\napplicable” and cohesiveness requirements.

Defendants, as a result, maintain that\ndetermining  whether  OKDHS  has  inadequate  monitoring  policies  requires  an\nindividualized determination for each foster child.  They also argue that Named\nPlaintiffs  have  not  met  their  burden  of  proving  that  every  class  member  is\nsimultaneously subject to an imminent risk of serious harm as a result of OKDHS’s\ncontroverted policies and practices.  Defendants assert that the very statistics Named\nPlaintiffs cite—1.2% of Oklahoma foster children in 2006 reported abuse or neglect,\nfor  instance—reveal  Named  Plaintiffs  have  not  met  this  burden.    They  reason\n“[b]ecause  98.8% [of foster children] did not suffer injury or neglect, and because\nnot all putative class members are under an imminent threat of serious harm, the\nDistrict Court’s findings were clearly erroneous.” \nDefendants also argue for the first time that Named Plaintiffs’ proposed class\ndefinition is “overly broad” because it includes children who are not under an actual\nor imminent threat of harm, thereby defeating commonality and typicality.  We, of\ncourse, generally will not consider new arguments on appeal.  See Robey-Harcourt\nv. BenCorp Financial Co., Inc., 326 F.3d 1140, 1143 (10th Cir. 2003) (explaining\nthat “we will not consider a new theory on appeal, even one ‘that falls under the\nsame general category as an argument presented at trial’”).  But to the extent that\nDefendants’ “overly broad” argument relies on their argument, which they did assert\nbelow, that Named Plaintiffs must prove every class member is under a threat of\nharm to satisfy Rule 23(a)’s requirements of commonality and typicality, we address\n8\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 10\nit here.\nNamed Plaintiffs allege OKDHS caseworkers routinely fail to comply with its\nown policy of requiring caseworkers to visit children in the foster care program at\nleast once per month to monitor children’s safety and placement.  They presented\nevidence to the district court that for the last five years Oklahoma has placed among\nthe three worst states in the nation for the abuse or neglect of children in foster care.\nThey also assert a report by the Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth found\nthat 25% of the foster homes it reviewed had serious safety issues and should never\nhave been approved for placement by OKDHS in the first place.  Named Plaintiffs\nmaintain this and other similar evidence reveal OKDHS has a practice of failing to\nadequately  monitor  the  safety  of  class  members,  exposing  all  of  them  to  an\nunreasonable risk of harm. \nIn its ruling, the district court acknowledged the considerable diversity of the\nclass Named Plaintiffs seek to represent—foster children range in age from infants\nto teenagers, enter the system for many different reasons, may be placed in thirty-\nnine different kinds of placements, and have varying needs and goals.  Nevertheless,\nthe district court found at least one common issue of fact as to “[w]hether [OK]DHS\nhas a policy or practice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of plaintiff\nchildren causing significant harm and risk of harm to [their] safety, health and well-\nbeing.”  The district court explained that, based on the evidence submitted, whether\nOKDHS’s policies or practices inflict harm or a risk of harm presents a question of\n9\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 11\nfact common to all children in the proposed class but expressly noted it was “not\nmaking any finding that these children are all subjected to harm as a result of\n[OK]DHS’s monitoring practices.” Similarly, the district court did not state it found\nOKDHS’s policies or practices actually subjected all class members to a risk of\nharm.  The court simply found that the issue of “whether [OKDHS’s] monitoring\npractices compromise the safety of foster children is an issue common to the entire\nproposed class[,]” regardless of their unique factual circumstances.    Based on the\nsame rationale, the district court found at least one common issue of law regarding\n“whether the alleged policies or practices violate plaintiffs’ [substantive due process]\nright to be reasonably free from harm and imminent risk of harm while in state\ncustody.”  (citing Yvonne L. v. New Mexico Dep’t of Human Serv., 959 F.2d 883,\n892 (10th Cir. 1992) (explaining that children in state custody have a constitutional\nright to be reasonably safe from harm)).\nAccepting Named Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, as we must, we find the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding an issue of fact and law common\nto the class.  Named Plaintiffs presented more than conclusory statements that\nOKDHS’s agency-wide monitoring policies and practices, or lack thereof, create a\nrisk of harm shared by the entire class.2  All class members, by virtue of being in\n2 We do not suggest that Named Plaintiffs have at this stage proven OKDHS’s\nmonitoring  polices  or  practices  actually  subject  all  class  members  to  an\nimpermissible risk of harm.  For reasons we later explain, Named Plaintiffs need not\n(continued...)\n10\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 12\nOKDHS’s foster care, are subject to the purportedly faulty monitoring policies of\nOKDHS, regardless of their individual differences; therefore, all members of the\nclass are allegedly exposed to the same unreasonable risk of harm as a result of\nDefendants’ unlawful practices.   Though each class member may not have actually\nsuffered abuse,  neglect, or the risk of such harm, Defendants’ conduct allegedly\nposes a risk of impermissible harm to all children in OKDHS custody.  Thus, we\nconclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the requirement of\ncommonality satisfied.  \nDefendants’ discussion of Milonas v. Williams, 691 F.2d 931, 935 (10th Cir.\n1982) is unavailing.  In Milonas, we affirmed the certification of a class of all\njuveniles committed to a Utah correctional school in a lawsuit which alleged that\nregardless of their individual differences “all of the boys at the school were in danger\nof being subjected to” the institution’s illegal practices.  Id. at 938.  We, therefore,\nconcluded the typicality and commonality requirements of Rule 23(a) had been met.\nId.   The shared risk of being subjected to the purportedly unconstitutional practices\njustified certification.  We did not require the named plaintiffs in Milonas to prove\neither every class member had actually been subjected to the controverted practices\n2(...continued)\nprove class members have actually been subjected to an impermissible risk of harm\nat this stage.  Rather, we mean Named Plaintiffs have provided, as Shook II and\nVallario  require,  more  than  conclusory  statements  to  demonstrate  that  whether\nOKDHS’s  monitoring  policies  and  practices  subject  class  members  to  an\nimpermissible risk of harm constitutes a question of fact common to the entire class.\n11\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 13\nor every class member had actually suffered constitutionally-cognizable harm as a\nresult of the practices.  Similarly, in this case, every class member, by virtue of being\nin OKDHS’s custody, is subject to OKDHS’s monitoring practices or lack thereof\nand, therefore, “the issue of whether the monitoring practices compromise the safety\nof foster children is an issue common to the entire proposed class.” \nDefendants’ reliance on J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280 (10th Cir.\n1999), is also unpersuasive.  In J.B., we held the district court had not abused its\ndiscretion  in  denying  class  certification.    The  named  plaintiffs  in  J.B.  alleged\nmultiple state agencies violated their rights; whereas, here Named Plaintiffs only\nallege one state agency and its policies violated their rights.  Second, the class of\nplaintiffs in J.B. was far broader.  The proposed class consisted of all children,\ncustodial and non-custodial (those at risk of being taken into state custody), who had\nany form of developmental or mental disability.  We, therefore, concluded “[o]ther\nthan being disabled in some way and having some sort of contact with [the state]’s\nchild welfare system, no common factual link joins” the suggested class.  Id. at 1289.\nIn contrast, Named Plaintiffs in this case propose a class of only those foster children\nin the custody of OKDHS by reason of abuse or neglect.  Unlike the class members\ndenied certification in J.B., all class members now before us are in the custody of\none agency—OKDHS—for the same reason—abuse or neglect—and all are subject\nto OKDHS’s monitoring policies, which allegedly subject them to a constitutionally\nunreasonable risk of harm.\n12\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 14\nDespite Defendants’ repeated suggestions otherwise, at the class certification\nstage Named Plaintiffs do not bear the burden of proving the veracity of their\ncomplaint’s allegations.  Defendants’ contention that Rule 23(a)’s commonality and\ntypicality requirements demand that Named Plaintiffs prove all class members were\ninadequately monitored or are actually exposed to an imminent threat of harm as a\nresult of deficient monitoring conflates the requirements for standing, prospective\ninjunctive relief, and class certification.  First, only named plaintiffs in a class action\nseeking prospective injunctive relief must demonstrate standing by establishing they\nare suffering a continuing injury or are under an imminent threat of being injured in\nthe future.  See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 502 (1975) (“Petitioners must allege\nand show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered\nby other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they\npurport to represent.”);  Tandy v. City of Wichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1283 (10th Cir.\n2004) (“To seek prospective relief, the plaintiff must be suffering a continuing injury\nor be under a real and immediate threat of being injured in the future.”).3  Second,\n3 “Past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate\nthreat of repeated injury.”  Tandy, 380 F.3d at 1283.   To this end, the remaining six\nof the original nine Named Plaintiffs allege physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other\ninjury due to unsafe conditions while in custody of OKDHS (three of the original\nnine Named Plaintiffs are no longer representatives or members of the class because\nthey have been adopted or are no longer in OKDHS custody).  The district court\nconcluded the remaining Named Plaintiffs’ allegations satisfied standing’s injury in\nfact requirement and prospective relief’s imminent risk of future injury requirement.\nDefendants do not challenge these findings on appeal and, consequently, we do not\n(continued...)\n13\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 15\nRule 23’s certification requirements neither require all class members to suffer harm\nor threat of immediate harm nor Named Plaintiffs to prove class members have\nsuffered such harm.  On the contrary, Named Plaintiffs only have a burden to prove\nthat the allegations of their complaint, which at this stage we and the district court\nmust accept as true, satisfy Rule 23(a)’s requirements.  Shook I, 386 F.3d at 968.\nThe Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 23 explains certification is appropriate even\nif the defendant’s action or inaction “has taken effect or is threatened only as to one\nor a few members of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general\napplication to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), 1966 Amendment advisory\ncommittee note.  “[A] class will often include persons who have not been injured by\nthe defendant’s conduct . . . . Such a possibility or indeed inevitability does not\npreclude class certification.”  Kohen v. Pacific Inv. Mgmt. Co., 571 F.3d 672, 677\n(7th Cir. 2009).  Rule 23(a) only requires the district court to find a question of fact\nor law common to all class members.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).   Requiring Named\nPlaintiffs to prove all class members were inadequately monitored or are actually\nexposed to a threat of harm due to OKDHS’s monitoring practices at the certification\nstage would require them to answer the common question of fact or law, rather than\njust prove it exists.  Rule 23(a) does not require the district court to have an answer\nbefore certifying a class; classwide discovery and further litigation answer the\n3(...continued)\naddress them further. \n14\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 16\nquestion after certification. \nWe also briefly address Defendants’ argument that the district court made an\nerroneous finding of fact.  Defendants maintain because the evidence presented\ndemonstrated a class member has only a 1.2% chance of being injured, then 98.8%\nof the putative class is not under an imminent threat of serious harm and, therefore,\nno issue of fact or law common to its members exists.  This argument entirely misses\nthe mark.  The “injury” the Named Plaintiffs allege which the district court found\nconstituted a question of fact common to the class is not solely actual abuse or\nneglect.  The injury, instead, includes exposure to an impermissible risk of harm due\nto OKDHS’s alleged agency-wide failure to monitor class members adequately.  That\n“only” 1.2% of OKDHS foster children actually suffered abuse reveals nothing about\nhow  many  of  those  children  were  not  properly  monitored  and  yet  survived  an\nunconstitutional risk of abuse or neglect unscathed.  Logically, the fact that 1.2% of\nOKDHS foster children reported abuse or neglect does not mean the rest of the class\nwas not exposed to an impermissible risk of serious harm.  In theory, 100% of foster\nchildren  could  live  under  an  imminent  threat  of  serious  harm,  but  only  1.2%\nultimately suffer and report abuse or neglect. \nB.\nHaving rejected Defendants’ claims of error as to the district court’s finding\nof commonality pursuant to Rule 23(a), we now address the district court’s typicality\nfinding.  Rule 23(a)(3) requires the claims of Named Plaintiffs to be typical of the\n15\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 17\nclaims of the class they seek to represent.  The interests and claims of Named\nPlaintiffs and class members need not be identical to satisfy typicality.  Anderson v.\nCity of Albuquerque, 690 F.2d 796, 800 (10th Cir. 1982).  Provided the claims of\nNamed Plaintiffs  and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory,\ndiffering fact situations of the class members do not defeat typicality.  Adamson v.\nBowen, 855 F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir. 1988).  \nDefendants argue against typicality by emphasizing class members’ individual\ncircumstances and, therefore, the individualized defense to each class member’s\nclaim of a constitutional violation.  They also contend that Named Plaintiffs’ claims\ncannot  be  typical  of  the  class  because  the  Named  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  they\nsuffered abuse while in OKDHS custody, while “only 1.2% of class members have\nsuffered abuse or neglect while in foster care.”  \nAfter conducting its commonality analysis, the district court concluded that\nthough each Named Plaintiff and each potential class member has his or her own\nunique background, the interests of the Named Plaintiffs and the class members are\nnot significantly antagonistic to one another.  And, like commonality, typicality\nexists where, as here, all class members are at risk of being subjected to the same\nharmful practices, regardless of any class member’s individual circumstances.  See\nMilonas, 691 F.2d at 938 (finding commonality and typicality where all members of\nclass were in danger of being subjected to certain disciplinary practices regardless\nof their individual differences).  The harm and threat of harm suffered by the Named\n16\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 18\nPlaintiffs as a result of OKDHS’s allegedly deficient monitoring practices is typical\nof the harm and threat of harm suffered by all children in the class because all foster\nchildren are subject to OKDHS’s challenged, agency-wide monitoring policies.\nAdditionally, Named Plaintiffs allege OKDHS’s monitoring policies violate their\nsubstantive due process rights to be free from harm while in state custody, the same\nlegal  theory  that  underlies  class  members’  corresponding  claims.    Due  to  the\ncommon risk of harm and the common underlying legal theory for asserting that risk,\nthe district court acted within its discretion to find that typicality was satisfied.\nII.\nIn addition to satisfying Rule 23(a)’s requirements, the class must also meet\nthe requirements of one of the types of classes described in subsection (b) of Rule\n23.  Named Plaintiffs in this case seek to certify a Rule 23(b)(2) type of class, i.e.,\nthey assert Defendants have “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally\nto the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is\nappropriate for the class as a whole.”4  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  As we explained in\nShook II, Rule 23(b)(2) “imposes two independent, but related requirements” upon\n4 Rule 23(b) explains:\nA class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . . . .\n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\nthat  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as\na whole. . . .\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n17\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 19\nthose seeking class certification.  Shook II, 543 F.3d at 604.  First, plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate  defendants’  actions  or  inactions  are  “based  on  grounds  generally\napplicable to all class members.”  Id.  Second, plaintiffs must also establish the\ninjunctive relief they have requested is “appropriate for the class as a whole.”  Id.\n(emphasis in original).  Together these requirements demand “cohesiveness among\nclass members with respect to their injuries. . . .”  Id.  \nThis cohesiveness, in turn, has two elements.  First, plaintiffs must illustrate\nthe class is “sufficiently cohesive that any classwide injunctive relief” satisfies Rule\n65(d)’s requirement that every injunction “‘state its terms specifically; and describe\nin reasonable detail . . . the act or acts restrained or required.’”  Id. (quoting Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 65(d)).  Second, cohesiveness also requires that class members’ injuries are\n“sufficiently  similar”  that  they  can  be  remedied  in  a  single  injunction  without\ndifferentiating between class members.  Id.  Rule 23(b)(2)’s bottom line, therefore,\ndemands at the class certification stage plaintiffs describe in reasonably particular\ndetail  the  injunctive  relief  they  seek  “such  that  the  district  court  can  at  least\n‘conceive of an injunction that would satisfy [Rule 65(d)’s] requirements,’ as well\nas the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).”  Id. at 605 (quoting Monreal v. Potter, 367\nF.3d 1224, 1236 (10th Cir. 2004)). \nDefendants  challenge  the  district  court’s  Rule  23(b)(2)  determination  by\narguing that the district court did not make a specific finding that OKDHS’s actions\nor inactions are based on grounds generally applicable to all class members as Rule\n18\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 20\n23(b)(2) requires.  A review of the district court’s ruling does not bear out this\nargument.  The district court determined at least two remedies requested by Named\nPlaintiffs satisfied Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements as explained in Shook II: (1) an\ninjunction setting limits on the caseloads of caseworkers and their supervisors set by\nCOA  and  CWLA  and  (2)  an  injunction  mandating  caseworkers  monitor  foster\nchildren  by  visiting  them  as  frequently  as  set  forth  under  COA  and  CWLA\nstandards.5  The district court explained that because Named Plaintiffs assert that\nexcessive caseloads are harming or putting at risk of harm all children in the class,\nthe imposition of caseload limits would apply to the entire class.  Similarly, the\ndistrict court explained in its ruling the monitoring injunctive relief requested meets\nRule 23(b)(2)’s cohesiveness requirement.  Admittedly, the district court did not\nrecite the exact language of Rule 23(b)(2)—“the party opposing the class has acted\nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class”—when applying Shook\nII and its teachings to the facts of this case, but earlier in its ruling as part of its\n5 For example, according to Named Plaintiffs, CWLA standards suggest a\ncaseload  of  twelve  to  fifteen  children  per  caseworker  and  no  more  than  five\ncaseworkers per supervisor.  And, according to Named Plaintiffs, COA standards\nrequire caseworkers to meet with foster children and parents at least once per month.\nThe district court did not necessarily accept Named Plaintiffs’ proposition that the\ncaseload limits or monitoring requirements should be based on these standards.  But\nbecause Named Plaintiffs had given specific content as what it would mean to\nprovide adequate caseload staffing or adequate monitoring by relying on the COA\nand CWLA standards, the district court found “the injunctive relief is set forth in\nenough concrete manageable detail that the court could at least conceive of an\ninjunction that would satisfy the requirements of both Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d).”\n19\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 21\ncareful and detailed explanation of Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements as set forth in\nShook II, it did quote that precise language of Rule 23(b)(2).  We refuse to find an\nabuse of discretion where the district court is accused of not talismanically reciting\nRule 23(b)(2)’s exact language in applying the law to the facts when it clearly\nunderstood the law it was required to apply and accurately applied it.  Implicit in the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the imposition of caseload limits would apply to the\nentire class is the conclusion that all class members by virtue of living in OKDHS’s\nfoster care are subject to OKDHS’s alleged policy or practice of either assigning\nexcessive caseloads or failing to ensure caseworkers are not carrying excessive\ncaseloads.  Thus, the district court found that at least one of Named Plaintiffs’\nrequested  injunctions  remedies  OKDHS’s  conduct  based  on  grounds  generally\napplicable to the class. \nDefendants contend they presented evidence that the caseloads of caseworkers\nin rural areas were not excessive and that OKDHS caseworkers for the most part\nmake their required visits.  Defendants therefore maintain the district court “could\nnot have found these issues to have been generally applied to the class as a whole.”\nThey also claim this same evidence demonstrates Plaintiffs failed to prove all class\nmembers suffered sufficiently similar injuries at the hands of OKDHS to satisfy Rule\n23(b)(2)’s cohesiveness requirement.  These arguments misunderstand what Rule\n23(b)(2)’s “generally applicable” and cohesiveness requirements demand.  First, Rule\n23(b)(2) does not require Named Plaintiffs to prove OKDHS’s controverted policies\n20\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 22\nor practices actually harm or impose a risk of harm upon every class member at the\nclass certification stage.  As explained above, certification is appropriate even if the\ndefendant’s action or inaction “has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a\nfew members of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general\napplication to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), 1966 Amendment advisory\ncommittee note (emphasis added).   That a class possibly or even likely includes\npersons  unharmed  by  a  defendant’s  conduct  should  not  preclude  certification.\nKohen, 571 F.3d at 677.  So long as OKDHS’s challenged practices are based on\ngrounds that apply generally to the class, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is\nproper even if at the class certification stage it is conceivable some class members\nhave not been actually abused, neglected, or exposed to a risk of harm.  Here the\n“grounds” that have general application to the class are that all class members have\nbeen placed in OKDHS’s foster care program and, as such, caseworkers monitor all\nclass members in a system that allegedly fails to ensure they do not carry caseloads\nso demanding that they cannot monitor class members adequately.  Second, Rule\n23(b)(2)  demands  class  members’  injuries  alleged  by  Named  Plaintiffs  at  the\ncertification stage appear “sufficiently similar that they can be addressed in a single\ninjunction that need not differentiate between class members.”  Shook II, 543 F.3d\nat 604.  Named Plaintiffs allege the same injury on behalf of all class members as a\nresult of excessive caseloads—exposure to an impermissible risk of harm.  And, the\ndistrict court expressly found exposure to an impermissible risk of harm a fact issue\n21\n\nCase: 09-5093     Document: 01018362826     Date Filed: 02/08/2010     Page: 23\ncommon to the entire class.  To remedy this alleged harm, Named Plaintiffs propose\nan injunction requiring OKDHS assign no more than 15 foster children to each\ncaseworker  (based  on  CWLA  standards).    As  the  district  court  noted,  such  an\ninjunction applies to the proposed class as a whole without requiring differentiation\nbetween class members.  Because the district court properly applied the law to the\nalleged facts, we conclude Defendants’ challenge of the district court’s Rule 23(b)(2)\nfindings is without merit.\nIII.\nThe district court’s decision comports with Rule 23, our governing case law,\nand the alleged facts.  Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion.  We\nalso note the district court’s present certification decision is a preliminary one.  After\nthe parties conduct classwide discovery, the district court may find that the class, in\nfact, does not meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) or that more of Named Plaintiffs’\nrequested remedies or none at all meet Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements.  If the court so\nfinds, it possesses the discretion under Rule 23(c)(1)(C) to amend its certification\norder to reflect its findings or decertify the class altogether prior to final judgment.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C); see also In re Integra Realty Resources, Inc., 354 F.3d\n1246, 1261 (10th Cir. 2004). \nAFFIRMED.\n22",

Introduction \nThis  is  the  10th  Commentary  issued  by the  Co-Neutrals  to  review  progress  made  by  the \nOklahoma Department of Human Services (“DHS”) to improve its child welfare system.  Under \nthe  Compromise  and  Settlement  Agreement  (CSA),  DHS  originally  planned  to  exit  the \nagreement in December 2016, but was unable to do so.  Over the course of the reform, \nimportant advancements have been made by DHS, but they are not yet fully rooted, particularly \nwith respect to manageable caseloads and an adequate array of placements for children.  In \nsome areas, most critically safety for children in the care and custody of DHS, the department’s \nefforts have been inadequate. In order to improve performance for children toward the Target \nOutcomes identified at the outset of this reform effort, DHS must make good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress in each of the measured areas described in this \nCommentary.  \n \nBackground \nOn January 4, 2012, DHS and Plaintiffs reached agreement in a long-standing federal class \naction lawsuit against the state of Oklahoma on behalf of children in the custody of DHS due to \nabuse and neglect by a parent or resource caregiver. That matter, D.G. vs. Yarborough, Case No. \n08-CV-074, resulted in the Compromise and Settlement Agreement (CSA), which was approved \nby the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on February 29, 2012. \nThe CSA requires (Section 2.10 (a)) that DHS develop a plan setting forth “specific strategies to \nimprove  the  child  welfare  system.”   Under  the  CSA,  the  parties  identified  and  the  court \napproved Eileen Crummy, Kathleen Noonan, and Kevin Ryan as “Co-Neutrals,” and charged \nthem to evaluate and render judgment about the ongoing performance of DHS to strengthen its \nchild welfare system to better meet the needs of vulnerable children, youth, and families. The \nCSA states specifically  (Section 2.10 (i)) that, “Twice annually, the Co-Neutrals shall provide \ncommentary regarding the Department’s overall progress as reflected by the [data] reports and \nshall provide commentary as to whether the Department is making good faith efforts pursuant \nto Section 2.15 of the Settlement Agreement.”  \nDHS, with the assistance of state leaders, advocates, and other stakeholders, developed the \nPinnacle Plan, which contains significant commitments to be implemented beginning in State \nFiscal Year (SFY) 2013. The Co-Neutrals approved the Pinnacle Plan on July 25, 2012.  \nThe CSA charged DHS with identifying baselines and Target Outcomes to measure and report \nthe state’s progress in core performance areas, which are grouped in the following seven \nperformance categories: \n(cid:120)  Maltreatment (abuse and neglect) of children in the state’s legal custody (MIC); \n(cid:120)  Development of foster homes and therapeutic foster homes (TFC); \n5 \n \n\n(cid:120)  Regular and consistent visitation of caseworkers with children in the state’s legal \ncustody; \n(cid:120)  Reduction in the number of children in shelters; \n(cid:120)  Placement stability, reducing the number of moves a child experiences while in the \nstate’s legal custody; \n(cid:120)  Child permanency, through reunification, adoption or guardianship; and, \n(cid:120)  Manageable caseloads for child welfare staff. \nAs required by the CSA, the Co-Neutrals and DHS established the Metrics, Baselines, and \nTargets  Plan  (the  “Metrics  Plan”)  on  March  7,  2013.  For  each  of  the  seven  performance \ncategories, the Metrics Plan establishes: the methodology for the performance metrics and \nmeasuring progress; parameters for setting baselines; interim and final performance targets \nand outcomes; and the frequency by which DHS must report data and information to the Co-\nNeutrals and the public.  Appendix A provides a summary chart of the metrics for the seven \nperformance areas, with corresponding baselines and targets, established by DHS and the Co-\nNeutrals, and updated through September 2015.1  \nThe CSA further requires the Co-Neutrals to provide commentary and issue a determination as \nto whether DHS’ data submissions provide sufficient information to measure accurately the \ndepartment’s progress. The Co-Neutrals have previously found data sufficiency for all the CSA \nperformance areas and data metrics.  Pursuant to the CSA, the Co-Neutrals may revise any \ndetermination of data sufficiency based on subsequent or ongoing data submissions as deemed \nappropriate.  It is important to highlight that DHS’ data management team has made significant \nprogress during this reform, particularly in strengthening its ability and practice to manage and \nevaluate  its  data  to  support  data-driven  management  decisions  and  case  practice \nimprovements.   \nUnder Section 2.15 of the CSA, the parties established that the Co-Neutrals would issue a Final \nReport on December 15, 2016 that determines whether DHS has made, for a continuous period \nof at least two years prior to December 15, 2016, good faith efforts to achieve substantial and \nsustained  progress  towards  the  Target  Outcomes.    On  September  2,  2016,  DHS  and  the \nPlaintiffs jointly agreed by amendment to the CSA to suspend the Co-Neutrals’ issuance of the \nFinal Report. The amendment gives DHS the opportunity to request the Final Report from the \nCo-Neutrals at any time and maintains the requirement that the Co-Neutrals determine as part \n                                                      \n1 Under Section 2.10(f) of the CSA, the Co-Neutrals shall issue Baseline and Target Outcomes, which shall not be \nsubject to further review by either party but may at the discretion of the Co-Neutrals, after providing the parties \nan opportunity to comment, be revised by the Co-Neutrals. \n6 \n \n\nof that report whether DHS has, for a period of at least two years, made good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward each Target Outcome. \nThis document serves as the Co-Neutrals’ Tenth Commentary under the CSA and reflects DHS’ \nperformance,  data,  and  information  available  through  December  31,  2017.  In  numerous \ninstances,  as  described  in  this  report,  data  and  information  are  only  available  through \nSeptember 30, 2017 (due to reporting lags or intervals agreed upon previously by the Co-\nNeutrals and DHS).  In addition, in some instances, the Co-Neutrals report on more recent \ndecisions or activities by DHS to reflect, when possible, the most current view of the reform. \nGood Faith Efforts to Achieve Substantial and Sustained Progress \n \nThe CSA requires the Co-Neutrals to determine whether DHS has “made good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress” toward a Target Outcome. This standard requires \nmore than an assessment of DHS’ intentions but necessarily requires a conclusion by the Co-\nNeutrals that is based on an analysis of the activities undertaken and decisions made by DHS or, \nas the Co-Neutrals have stated, the inactions or failures to make decisions, and the impact of \nthose decisions and activities on achieving substantial and sustained progress toward a Target \nOutcome.  For example, the Co-Neutrals have focused their review and assessment of DHS’ \ntimeliness and thoroughness to implement, evaluate and, when needed, adjust core strategies \nto inform their judgment of whether the department has made good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcomes. \n  \nThe CSA requires the Co-Neutrals to report on those Target Outcomes that DHS has met, those \nfor  which  the  department  has  achieved  sustained,  positive  trending  toward  the  Target \nOutcomes, and those Target Outcomes for which DHS has not achieved sustained, positive \ntrending.  The following Table summarizes the Co-Neutrals’ findings of DHS’ progress toward \nthe Target Outcomes and, separately, the Co-Neutrals’ assessment of DHS’ efforts for each of \nthe performance metrics assessed during this report period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Target Outcomes  \n \nHas Made Good \nFaith Efforts to \nHas Achieved Sustained, \nHas Met

In nine performance areas, the Co-Neutrals find that DHS did not make \ngood faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcomes \nfor this report period. \n \nMethodology \n \nThe Co-Neutrals conducted a series of verification activities to evaluate DHS’ progress and \nimplementation of its commitments. These activities included meetings with DHS leadership \nand scores of staff across the state, private agency leadership, and child welfare stakeholders. \nThe Co-Neutrals also reviewed and analyzed a wide range of aggregate and detailed data \nproduced by DHS, and thousands of child and foster home records, policies, memos, and other \ninternal information relevant to DHS’ work during the period.   \n15 \n \n\nThe remainder of this report includes:  \n(cid:131)  Context Data of Children in DHS Custody (Section III); \n(cid:131)  Seven Performance Categories: Assessment of Progress and Good Faith Efforts (Section \nIV);  \n(cid:131)  Appendices; and, \n(cid:131)  Glossary of Acronyms. \nIII.  Context Data of Children in DHS Custody \nDHS has experienced a steady decline in the number of children in care over the last three \nyears.  At its highest number of children in care since 2007, there were 11,301 children in DHS \ncustody on June 30, 2014. Four years later, on June 30, 2018, there were 8,455 children in care, \na 25 percent drop. The decline in the population of children in care is the result of more \nchildren exiting care than entering care each year.     \nFigure 1: Number of Children in DHS Custody at the End of SFY - 2004 to 2018 \n14,000\n11,698 \n12,000 11,403  11,301 \n10,819  10,758  10,917 \n10,101  9,980  9,964 \n10,000 9,099  8,843  9,001 \n8,455 \n7,911 \n7,615 \n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0  \n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014  2015 2016 2017 2018\n \n                  Source: DHS Data \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \n\nDemographics \nDHS data show that there were 8,677 children in custody on December 31, 2017, while there \nwere 8,997 children in custody on July 1, 2017.2  During the reporting period from July 1, 2017 \nto December 31, 2017, 2,328 children entered care and 2,648 children exited care. \nYoung children aged zero to five years make up the largest portion (4,523 or 52 percent) of \nchildren in care. Children aged 6 to 12 years comprise 34 percent (2,911) of the population in \ncare and fourteen percent (1,243) are 13 years or older, as detailed in the following chart: \nFigure 2: Children in Care on December 31, 2017 by Age Group (Total = 8,677) \n13 or older \n0 to 1 \n1,243 \n1,891 \n14% \n22% \n6 to 12 \n2,911  2 to 5 \n34%  2,632 \n30%   \n \n \n     Source: DHS Data \n \nWith regard to gender, the population is split almost equally — 52 percent male and 48 percent \nfemale.  With regard to race, the population of children is 37 percent White, nine percent \nAfrican-American, and seven percent Native American.  In addition, 19 percent of children \nidentified with Hispanic ethnicity (and can be of any race).  Twenty-eight percent identified with \nmultiple race and ethnicity categories, of which 72 percent identified as Native American.3   \nAs presented in Figure 3 below, DHS’ data shows that of the children in care on December 31, \n2017, 48 percent (4,187) were in care for less than one year; 29 percent (2,516) between one \n                                                      \n2 In the prior commentary, DHS reported 9,001 children in care on June 30, 2017.  Due to data entry lag and \nmerged identifying numbers, OKDHS data now indicate 8,997 children in care on July 1, 2017.  These types of \nadjustments are common in child welfare administrative data. \n3 Overall, 33 percent of children identified as Native American including those children who identified with more \nthan one race and ethnicity category and those who identified as Hispanic. \n17 \n \n\nand two years; 11 percent (979) between two and three years; 9 percent (785) between three \nand six years; and 2 percent (210) for more than six years. \nFigure 3: Children in Care on December 31, 2017 by Length of Stay (Total = 8,677) \nLess than 1 \nyear \n4,187 \n6+ years \n48% \n210 \n3 to 6 years \n2% \n785 \n9% \n1 to 2 years \n2 to 3 years \n2,516 \n979   \n29% \n11%   \n \n  Source: DHS Data \n \nAs  the  following  chart  demonstrates,  93  percent  of  children  (8,034)  in  DHS  custody  on \nDecember 31, 2017 live in family settings, including in relative and non-relative kinship homes \n(40 percent), with foster families (39 percent), with their own parents (ten percent), and in \nhomes that intend to adopt (three percent).

Foster Care \nFoster Care Target Outcomes: New Foster Homes and Net Foster Home Gains \nFor SFY18, DHS committed to develop 1,075 new traditional, non-kinship foster homes. During \nthis six-month report period (which represents the first half of SFY18), DHS, along with its \nprivate agency partners, approved 368 new traditional foster homes. For this report period, for \nthe reasons described below, the Co-Neutrals find that DHS made good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  the  Target  Outcome  for  new  foster  home \ndevelopment.  \n \nFor SFY 18, DHS committed to achieve a net gain of 206 foster homes.

Further, \nduring this report period DHS did not take adequate steps to gain an understanding of the \nreasons for the high rate of foster home closures and did not implement expanded efforts to \nsupport and retain existing foster families.  For this period, the Co-Neutrals do not find that DHS \nmade  good  faith  efforts  to  achieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  the  Target \nOutcome for a net gain in the state’s pool of foster homes. \n \nFigure 5: New Foster Care Homes Developed by Month, July 2017-December 2017 \n80 74  75 \n68 \n70\n60 53 \n50 \n48 \n50\nTotal New \n40  Homes = \n368 \n30\n20\n10\n \n0  \nJul-17 Aug-17 Sep-17 Oct-17 Nov-17 Dec-1 7\n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nOf the 368 new foster homes approved during this six-month report period, DHS developed 49 \npercent of the homes (182) and its partner agencies developed 51 percent (186).6 \n                                                      \n6 As of July 2017, DHS had 15 private agency partners recruiting traditional foster homes.  \n20 \n \n\nFigure 6: New Foster Homes Developed by Agency, July 2017-December 2017 (N=368)\nPrivate \nAgency \n186 \n51% \nDHS \n182 \n \n49% \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nOf the 368 foster homes approved during the first six months of SFY18, 214 families (58 \npercent) were newly recruited by DHS and the private agencies, 110 homes (30 percent) were \nalready approved by DHS as adoption homes or kinship homes that were then converted to \ntraditional foster homes to serve non-kin children, and 44 (12 percent) were DHS resource \nhomes7 that were closed for more than a year and reopened during this report period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n7 DHS resource homes that are reopened could have been previously approved as a number of different types of \nDHS resources, including traditional, kinship, emergency foster care, TFC, and DDS homes. \n21 \n \n\nFigure 7:  New Foster Homes by Type, July 2017-December 2017 (N=368) \nReopened \n44 \n12% \nKinship/ \nAdoption \nConversion  New \n110  214 \n30%  58% \n \n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nEfforts to Recruit New Foster Homes \nDuring this report period, DHS maintained its internal team of regional foster home recruiters \nand continued to collaborate with its private agency partners to develop new homes and move \ntoward the SFY18 recruitment goals. The statewide Oklahoma Fosters campaign continued to \nsupport DHS’ efforts to recruit additional foster homes and held several recruitment events \nthroughout Oklahoma during the period.  Due to DHS’ substantial loss of foster homes over the \nlast eighteen months, these recruitment efforts continue to be crucial to ensure DHS is able to \nbuild and maintain a robust pool of foster homes to serve children in DHS custody.  \n \nDHS made initial efforts to develop specialized, family-based placements for children with \ndevelopmental disabilities. DHS established a team of five DHS recruiters to coordinate with \nDHS’ Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS) to develop new DDS Specialized Foster Care and \nAgency Companion homes, as well as identify any open, experienced foster homes willing and \nable to meet the specialized and therapeutic needs of children with developmental disabilities.8  \nThis is a new recruitment team and DHS was still in the process of filling staff positions during \nthe period. As of February 2018, DHS reported that three of the five recruiters had been hired \nand were completing cross-training with foster care and DDS and that the other two positions \nhad been posted to fill.  \n                                                      \n8 Specialized Foster Care and Agency Companion homes are managed out of DHS’ DDS program office and children \nplaced with these families, who receive specialized training, must meet specific disability diagnosis criteria to \nobtain the required Medicaid waiver for placement.  \n22 \n \n\nSome children with developmental disabilities meet the criteria for a Medicaid waiver, which \nallows  them  to  be  placed  in  specialized  family-based  homes  that  are  managed  by  DDS. \nHowever, some children who present on a spectrum of high to low disability needs do not \nqualify for the waiver but still require additional services for them and/or their foster parents to \nmeet their needs and advance their permanency, stability and well-being.  In coordination with \nthe Oklahoma Fosters team, DHS began conducting targeted outreach to build its foster home \ncapacity for children with varying levels of disabilities and reviewing the different supports that \ncan be offered to foster families willing to complete additional training and care for children \nwith disabilities.   \nDHS has long faced the challenge of having a substantial waitlist for specialized DDS homes to \ncare for all Oklahoma children needing a DDS home placement, not only for children in DHS \ncustody with a developmental disability. As discussed further below, DHS, over the last two \nyears, increasingly used the Laura Dester Children’s Center (Laura Dester), a state-run shelter in \nTulsa,  to  place  children  in  DHS  custody  who  are  dually  or  multi-diagnosed  with  complex \nbehavioral, medical and developmental challenges.   \nDHS  has  found  it  most  challenging  to  secure  family-based  placements  for  sibling  groups, \nadolescents and children who present with some behavioral challenges but do not qualify for \nTFC or higher-level placement. DHS reports that it continues to update and implement new \nhome recruitment plans targeted to these populations of children.  However at this time, as \ndiscussed below, DHS’ data shows there are too few available foster home placements for \nchildren removed from their families. This limits DHS in its ability to ensure that best placement \nmatches are made into foster homes capable of meeting a child’s needs.   \n \nNet Gain Target and Performance \nDHS’ net gain target for the full 12 months of SFY18 was set at 206 foster homes.  While DHS \nmade progress with the development of 368 new foster homes during this report period, DHS \nclosed more homes than it developed.  DHS began the period with a starting baseline of 2,139 \nopen foster homes and by the end of the six-month period, DHS reported 2,075 open homes, a \nnet loss of 64 foster homes. Of the 2,139 foster homes open at the beginning of the period, 460 \nwere no longer open at the period’s end, a high closure rate of 22 percent.  Of these foster \nhomes, 263 (57 percent) were DHS managed homes and 197 (43 percent) were foster homes \nmanaged by DHS’ private agency partners. Of the 368 new foster homes approved during this \nreport period, 12 closed by January 1, 2018.   \n \nOklahoma’s net loss of foster homes has been an ongoing problem that did not begin during \nthis report period. Over the last three periods, from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, DHS \n23 \n \n\nclosed 1,465 foster homes, resulting in a net loss of 271 foster homes.  Despite the steady \ndecline in the number of children in DHS’ custody over the last four years, DHS continues to \nexperience a shortage of foster homes due to these net losses.  At the beginning of April 2018, \nDHS staff reported to the Co-Neutrals during a field office visit in Oklahoma City that there were \nonly five foster homes in the county that were available for a new placement.  To verify and \nfurther assess this reported foster home shortage, the Co-Neutrals reviewed in early May 2018 \nDHS’ real time foster home vacancy data that caseworkers rely on daily to identify available \nfamily-based placements. The report contains the list of all traditional foster homes (managed \nby both DHS and the private agencies) that have at least one vacant bed. The Co-Neutrals \ndetermined there were only eight foster homes in Oklahoma County with a vacancy, none of \nwhich indicated the foster parents were willing to care for a child over the age of 10.  The data \nalso showed that Oklahoma County had 18 foster homes with more children placed with the \nfamilies than the number of children foster parents reported as their preferred number of \nplacements.9   At the same time, DHS’ placement data showed that during the same month \n(May 2018), DHS removed 41 children whose county of jurisdiction is Oklahoma County and 17 \nof these 41 newly removed children were placed in traditional foster homes; however, only \nnine of these 17 children were placed in Oklahoma County.    \n \nIn Tulsa County, there were only 13 traditional foster homes at the beginning of May 2018 with \na vacancy and of these only five foster homes were vacant with no child placements.  New \nremoval placement data for May 2018 showed that DHS removed 58 children whose county of \njurisdiction is Tulsa with 26 of these children entering a traditional foster home as their first \nplacement; however, only eight of these 26 children were placed in a Tulsa-based foster home.   \n \nStatewide,  DHS’  data  showed  just  170  traditional  foster  homes  had  at  least  one  vacant \nplacement  at  the  beginning  of  May  2018,  with  only  19  of  170  homes  willing  to  accept \nplacement of a child older than 12 years.  Only 91 homes statewide were vacant with no \ncurrent placements.  During the month of May 2018, DHS removed 353 children statewide with \n153  children  entering  traditional  foster  homes  for  their  first  placement:  99  of  these  153 \nchildren were placed in foster homes outside of their county of jurisdiction. During this six-\nmonth report period, DHS’ data showed that statewide the department removed an average of \n390 children each month and that an average of 446 children exited care each month. Even \ntaking into account that DHS’ data shows that the number of child exits from custody exceeded \nthe number of children entering care during the period and that  nearly half of all newly \n                                                      \n9 A foster home can be licensed to accept the placement of more children than the preferred number of \nplacements identified by the foster parents.  As such, this data showing placements above a foster family’s \npreferred number of placements does not necessarily mean these homes are overfilled.  \n24 \n \n\nremoved children are placed in kinship homes, DHS will have to maintain a larger pool of \navailable traditional foster homes to sufficiently meet the family-based placement needs of \nchildren entering DHS custody.  \n \nThe Co-Neutrals have raised concerns in prior Commentary reports about the high percentage \nof foster homes that remained vacant for extensive periods of time, many of which were listed \nas unavailable for placements. DHS has worked over the past 18 months to assess whether \nthese homes should remain open and has taken action to close the homes of families unwilling \nto accept placements. The Co-Neutrals support DHS’ efforts to close foster homes that will not \naccept placements so that DHS knows with certainty its viable foster home capacity.  Despite \nthe closure of vacant and unavailable foster homes contributing to foster home net losses, \nfamilies who did not accept placements were not viable resources and DHS’ past practice of \nmaintaining those families  on  the  roster  of  open foster  homes  masked  the need  for the \ndevelopment of additional foster homes. With the closure of such homes, DHS now has a better \npicture of the actual number of foster homes available and willing to accept child placements. \nDHS worked diligently to close homes that were not viable; however at the end of this process, \nDHS had not gained a full understanding of the reasons these foster families decided to close \ntheir homes.    \nThe Co-Neutrals previously urged DHS to establish a process to enable the agency to gain an \nunderstanding of the reasons for Oklahoma’s high foster home closure rate. Acknowledging \nover one year ago that the department needed “to assess the ongoing trend of high closure \nrates of resource families,” DHS in April 2017 issued guidance to staff to document in DHS’ KIDS \ndatabase  system  the  most  accurate  reason  for  each  home  closure  as  a  first  step  in  this \nassessment.  In  July  2017,  DHS  foster  care  caseworkers  and  supervisors  were  provided \ninstructions  on  the  use  of  an  updated  and  expanded  menu  of  closure  reasons  that  the \ndepartment added to the KIDS database system.  By the middle of this report period, DHS \nshared that the information gathered from staff’s recorded home closures did not indicate any \nspecific trend or issue was leading to the high closure rate.  \n \nDHS leadership reported that the expanded menu of closure reasons is limited in terms of \nproviding a qualitative assessment of how practice and supports should be improved to better \nretain foster parents. However, the expanded closure menu in KIDS provided DHS with data \nregarding closure reasons that can serve as a starting point for a qualitative assessment of why \nfamilies leave the system. The breakdown of reasons for closures are outlined in the chart \nbelow. Of the 512 foster homes that closed during this report period, twenty six percent (132) \n25 \n \n\nof the families had adopted a child, which resulted in closure due to permanency.10 However, \n159 families (30 percent), closed their homes due to: the family having no desire to foster or \nadopt; dissatisfaction with the foster home process; the family’s placement preferences not \nbeing met; and the family not being able to meet a child’s needs. The remaining 221 homes \nwere closed due to administrative agency decisions, changes in family circumstances, and \nrequests by families to provide only respite care for children and a small number of other \nunknown reasons. \n \nFigure 8: Traditional Home Closure Reasons, July - December 2017 \n#  % \nResource Closures July to December 2017 \nResources  Resources \nADOPTION SERVICES COMPLETED  132  26% \nAGENCY DECISION-CONTRACT VIOLATIONS  7  1% \nAGENCY DECISION-FAILURE TO COOPERATE  10  2% \nAGENCY DECISION-LEGAL ISSUES  2  0.4% \nAGENCY DECISION-REFERRAL/INVESTIGATION  21  4% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-DISPLEASED WITH PROCESS  16  3% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-FAMILY DYNAMIC CHANGED  68  13% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-MEDICAL/ILLNESS  26  5% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-MOVING  31  6% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-NO DESIRE TO FOST/ADOPT  133  26% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-PLCMT PREFER NOT MET  3  1% \nRESOURCE REQUEST-UNABLE TO MT CHILD NEED  7  1% \nRESPITE ONLY  43  8% \nOTHER  11  2% \nAGENCY TRANSFER  2  0.4% \nTOTAL CLOSURES  512  100% \nData Source: Net Gain and YI035 \n \nIn order to engage with foster parents to gain an understanding of the reason for foster home \nclosures, DHS committed to utilize its monthly customer service survey calls to contact foster \nparents who requested to close their homes and whose foster homes were closed during the \n                                                      \n10 As noted above, 460 of the 512 homes closed during this period were calculated in the overall home closure \nrate, because these homes were open on the first day of the SFY. Additionally, 12 homes closed that were part of \nthe 368 new homes opened during the year and count toward the new home target.  Lastly, 40 homes closed \nduring the year that were new homes opened during the year that, for various reasons, do not count toward the \nnew home target.  \n26 \n \n\nprior month.11 DHS and the Co-Neutrals agreed in September 2017 that DHS would undertake \nthis qualitative assessment with the exit survey calls starting in November 2017, allowing time \nfor DHS to develop a brief closure reason survey of six questions and a process to record and \ntrack survey responses. Questions in the survey include: tell us about what led you to the \ndecision to no longer be a foster parent; and, is there anything you would recommend DHS (or \napplicable agency) consider doing differently that might enhance the experience of foster \nparents. DHS planned to select families from the pool of traditional foster homes that closed in \nOctober 2017 and then continue the survey process in each subsequent month. \n \nFor the 110 foster homes DHS contacted in November and December 2017, DHS found that \napproximately 40 of the homes should not have been part of the survey sample as some were \nstill open and others were kinship homes, which were not designated to be part of the survey.  \nDHS reported that based on the sample of homes that were correctly called, no obvious trends \nwere  identified.  However,  DHS  did  find  “there  may  have  been  some  instances  in  which \ncommunication between the assigned resource worker and family was not clear as to the \nhome’s closure.  In some cases, the families pointed out they were requesting time to take a \nbreak, but were encouraged by their worker to close their resource home.” Based on these \ncommunication concerns, DHS reported in February 2018 it is now requiring that for any \ntraditional foster home requesting to close, the assigned supervisor or field manager must \ncontact the family to inquire about their experience, resolve any issues when possible and \nensure there has been clear communication between the family and their assigned caseworker.   \n \nIt was not until well after the close of this report period that DHS began to glean some \npreliminary information on some underlying reasons foster families requested home closure. \nSpecifically, in June 2018, DHS reported to the Co-Neutrals that the home closure exit surveys \ncompleted with 52 families that closed their homes between January and March 2018 were \nbeginning to provide some initial insights on the reasons these foster homes closed. The Co-\nNeutrals support DHS’ efforts to gather this feedback from foster parents and encourage the \ndepartment to use these surveys to obtain as much qualitative information it can to best inform \nwhat actions DHS should take to support and retain foster families. The Co-Neutrals will report \non DHS’ findings in the next Commentary.  \n \n \n \n                                                      \n11 As highlighted in a prior Commentaries, DHS still maintains the practice that foster care workers must contact \ntheir assigned foster homes at least one time per month and visit the families in their homes once every three \nmonths.   \n27 \n \n\nSupporting Foster Parents \n \nMore than a year ago, DHS began to survey foster parents each month on the challenges they \nexperienced  fostering  Oklahoma’s  children.  Through  the  survey,  foster  parents  identified \nadditional  training  opportunities  as  an  important  and  unmet  need.  (See  Appendix  B)  \nSpecifically, foster parents requested training regarding effective care for teens, including how \nto manage their behaviors and guide them appropriately toward adulthood. Foster parents also \nidentified training needs regarding: how to respond therapeutically to the behavioral health \nchallenges and needs of foster children; the child welfare and court processes from removal to \nreunification; and, working with and understanding the perspective of biological families. Foster \nparents also requested more training availability in local and rural areas.   \n \nIn their last Commentary, the Co-Neutrals highlighted some of these foster parent training \nrequests and encouraged DHS to ensure that foster families are aware of the numerous topics \navailable in the in-service training program and to assess where additional training should be \ndeveloped or updated for foster families.  DHS reported that its foster care and adoption staff \nwere sent in June 2017 a listing of all foster parent in-service trainings available online, as staff \npreviously were not aware of the courses available to foster parents.  However, DHS, as of April \n2018, had not yet shared directly with foster parents the full list of online trainings that are \navailable.  \n \nDHS has decided only foster families approved and managed by DHS are ensured full, free \naccess to all online training. Foster families managed by private agencies have free access to \npre-service training and a limited number of in-service trainings.  DHS expects that the private \nagencies will work with the National Resource Center for Youth Services (NRCYS), the purveyor \nof the largest menu of foster parent trainings in Oklahoma, to establish a payment agreement \nto  allow  the  more  than  1,000  private  agency  foster  homes  access  to  in-service  training \nresources.  DHS should ensure that both its own foster parents and private agency foster \nparents have access to all available trainings that will help to strengthen their capacity to safely \nand effectively care for children and youth in DHS’ custody. DHS reports the department has \nbegun to address the need for greater access to foster parent training, including working with \nthe state’s Foster Care and Adoption Association in each region of the state to meet some of \nthe needs identified through the Foster Parent Support Workgroup.  \n \nJust over two years ago, DHS established its Foster Parent Support Workgroup to identify \nservices or supports foster parents need, develop solutions to any trending concerns impacting \nfoster families and proactively explore opportunities for service enhancements.  The workgroup \nwas developed as a core strategy to help retain foster parents. At the mid-point in this period, \n28 \n \n\nDHS reported that this workgroup had completed its assigned tasks, was on hiatus and had not \nmet since April 2017. (The exception was a subgroup that continued to meet to focus on and \naddress training issues.) DHS later clarified that the workgroup had reconvened in mid-February \n2018. The group includes DHS child welfare staff and representatives of tribes, foster care \nprivate agencies and other community partners, foster parents and foster parent advocates. \nThe Co-Neutrals do not presume that this one workgroup could have reversed the trend of high \nfoster home closure rates over the last three periods; however, it is of concern that DHS placed \nthe workgroup on hiatus during the time it was experiencing net losses in foster homes. The Co-\nNeutrals urge DHS to make focused efforts to utilize the workgroup and all available means to \ncommunicate with foster parents in order to identify their needs and, in collaboration with \nfoster parents and private agency partners, build supports to strengthen and retain the foster \nhomes Oklahoma has worked to develop.  \nFoster Home Board Rate \n \nAs previously reported, the monthly board rate payment provided to foster and adoptive \nfamilies was reduced by five percent effective July 1, 2017, which is approximately one dollar \nper day for each child they foster or have adopted. DHS had announced that statewide revenue \nfailures led to the department’s decision to reduce the rates but also highlighted that the daily \nrate for foster and adoptive parents would remain approximately four dollars per child above \nthe rate provided prior to 2012 when the reform effort began. In a positive reversal, the \nOklahoma Legislature and Governor Mary Fallin restored at the beginning of the SFY17 the five \npercent reduction and provided an additional five percent increase, which will go into effect \nJuly 1, 2018.  \nThe need for DHS to develop, support and retain foster parents capable of providing homes for \nchildren in the state’s custody has reached a critical point.  Moving ahead DHS must sustain the \nefforts it began after the close of this report period to understand the reasons more foster \nparents are leaving the system than entering. DHS must then provide services and support to \nretain foster families in order to ensure Oklahoma can provide available and safe foster homes \nfor children in need of family-based placements.  \nB.  Therapeutic Foster Care \nChildren who are eligible to be placed in therapeutic foster care (TFC) homes have been \nassessed to have emotional and behavioral health needs and can live in the community with \nspecially trained foster parents and therapeutic services.  DHS has established TFC homes as a \nkey component of Oklahoma’s continuum of care resources.  TFCs are intended to ensure that \nappropriate services are provided for children in need of behavioral health treatment to avoid \n29 \n \n\nplacing children in higher-levels of congregate care, offer family-based placements for those \nchildren ready to step-down from higher-levels of care and support more stable placements.  \nSince the beginning of the reform, DHS has faced several challenges within the TFC program, \nwhich the Co-Neutrals have documented in previous reports. One of the primary challenges is \nthe continuing net loss of TFC homes over the past five consecutive report periods.  For the \nsixth consecutive period, DHS reported having fewer TFC homes to serve children in DHS \ncustody  at  the  end  of  the  report  period  compared  to  the  beginning  of  the  period.  The \ncontinuous net loss of TFC homes is a result of inadequate focus and efforts to develop new TFC \nhomes, which DHS has consistently reported below the established, annual Target Outcome. \nTFC New Home Development and Net Gain/Loss \n \nDHS contracts with eight private agencies to recruit, manage and support TFC homes; unlike \ntraditional foster homes, DHS does not recruit and manage its own TFC homes.12 The Co-\nNeutrals accepted DHS’ proposed Target Outcome for new TFC home development for SFY18, \nwhich is set at 138.  During the first half of SFY17, DHS reported that its private agency partners \ndeveloped only 19 new TFC homes that met the established criteria for counting new TFC \nhomes. \n   \nFigure 9: New Therapeutic Foster Homes by Month, July 2017-December 2017 \n6\n5  5 \n5\n4  4 \n4\nTotal  \n3\nNew   \n2 Homes =  \n1  19 \n1\n0 \n0\nJul-17 Aug-17 Sep-17 Oct-17 Nov-17 Dec-17\n \n  \n           Source: DHS Data \n \n                                                      \n12 At the beginning of the report writing, DHS had contracts with ten TFC private agencies and subsequently \nreported that TFC contracts with two agencies were ended.  For this report period, only seven of the ten agencies \nwith contracts at the start of the period developed at least one new TFC resource home.  \n30 \n \n\nOf the new TFC homes,  nine were brand-new homes,  three were adoption/kinship home \nconversions, and seven were reopened homes.  \n \nTFC Net Gain/Loss \nOn July 1, 2017, DHS began the fiscal year with a starting baseline of 280 TFC homes and ended \nthe six month period with 225 open TFC homes on January 1, 2018, representing a net loss of \n55 TFC homes. The SFY18 net gain target was established at 20 TFC homes.  Of the 280 TFC \nhomes open on July 1, 2017, 84 were no longer open on January 1, 2018, resulting in a TFC \nhome closure rate of 30 percent within the first half of the fiscal year.  Of the 19 new TFC \nhomes DHS’ partner agencies developed from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, two homes \nclosed by January 1, 2018.  \n \nDuring the period, the number of children placed in a TFC home also declined substantially (24 \npercent) from 307 children on June 30, 2017 to 232 children on December 31, 2017. The \ndecline is even starker (44 percent) when reviewed over a one-year period, as there were 413 \nchildren in a TFC placement on December 31, 2016.  The fundamental result of DHS’ diminished \npool of available TFC homes is that fewer children with behavioral challenges are cared for in \nspecialized family-based placements with increased therapeutic supports.  \nTFC Waitlist and Home Vacancies \nDespite the continuing decline in the number of open TFC homes in Oklahoma, the waitlist of \nchildren who need a TFC placement also has fallen significantly.  In May 2018, DHS’ TFC waitlist \nshowed a total of 41 children, representing a marked, steady decline from 120 children on the \nwaitlist in March 2016 and 62 children on the waitlist in March 2017.   \nIn numerous prior reports, the Co-Neutrals highlighted that DHS’ data showed an incongruity \nbetween a TFC waitlist of over 100 children and a significant number of TFC homes appearing as \nvacant, often for extended periods of time.   \nDHS, during the second half of calendar year 2016, undertook a comprehensive evaluation of its \nTFC program, which included a review of longstanding vacant homes, the TFC child waitlist, the \nchallenges with effectively matching children with TFC families and the quality of therapeutic \nservices and care in TFC homes.  DHS found that a substantial number of open, vacant TFC \nhomes needed to be closed for a variety of reasons, including families no longer wanting to care \nfor children with higher-level needs and homes being interested only in providing temporary \nrespite care and not full time therapeutic foster care for a child with behavioral needs.  DHS has \ncommitted to make it a standing practice to maintain a more accurate account of the pool of \nopen and available TFC homes and to work with its TFC partner agencies to routinely review \n31 \n \n\nTFC homes with extended vacancies to determine which homes that should remain open for \nTFC placement and which should be closed.  \nOf the 225 TFC homes open on January 1, 2018, 62 homes (28 percent) had no TFC placement \nand 17 (eight percent) had been vacant for more than 90 days.  Forty-four TFC homes were \nvacant of any placements, 129 had only TFC child placements; 18 had non-TFC placements only; \nand the remaining 34 had a combination (with a total of 69 non-TFC kids).13   \nWith respect to the TFC waitlist, DHS reported that its TFC program assessment determined \nthere  were  children  placed  on  the  TFC  waitlist  who  should  not  have  been  included  or \nmaintained on the list.  DHS had previously reported that all children on the waitlist had \nreceived initial approval for TFC placement by the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA), the \nauthorizing state agency. However, DHS leadership  subsequently came to understand that \nindividuals, including DHS caseworkers and supervisors, outside of the TFC program office were \nadding  children  to  the  waitlist,  sometimes  without  an  authorization  request  ever  being \nsubmitted to OHCA.14  As a result, there were children on the waitlist who had not received \ninitial authorization from OHCA, and who, based on their diagnosis, were not eligible to receive \nauthorization to be placed in a TFC home.  DHS also found children on the waitlist who had \nbeen  stabilized  in  non-TFC  placements  (family-based  and  higher-level  settings)  that  more \nappropriately met their needs and therefore no longer required a TFC home. \nImproved Child Placement Process  \nDHS developed a new management tool called the Application for Therapeutic Foster Care \n(“Application”), which it began using in May 2017 to aid the child placement process. The \nApplication, which DHS updated during this report period, is a form that includes information \nabout a child that is supplied by a child’s caseworker to DHS’ TFC program staff when the \ndecision is made to request authorization for a TFC placement. The Application replaced a one-\npage worksheet, which most caseworkers previously completed to request a TFC placement.  \nOHCA reviews the completed Application for each child to make an initial decision to authorize \nTFC level care. Only after initial OHCA authorization is received will DHS’ TFC program staff add \na child to its TFC waitlist, assuming a TFC placement is not available immediately upon request.  \nDHS now distributes a child’s Application to the TFC agencies only after a child has received an \n                                                      \n13 Of those homes with a combined number of TFC and non-TFC children placed together, five was the maximum \ntotal number of children placed (three TFC and two non-TFC children), which occurred in just one TFC home.  This \nwas followed by a maximum of four children placed (two TFC and two non-TFC children), which occurred in four \nTFC homes.  The most frequent combination of TFC and non-TFC child placements together appeared in 17 TFC \nhomes that had one TFC child and one non-TFC child. \n14 Upon the request of DHS’ TFC program office, OHCA determines if a child in DHS custody meets the state of \nOklahoma’s established criteria and is authorized to be placed in a TFC home. \n32 \n \n\ninitial authorization from OHCA for TFC level of care. To help ensure that the TFC waitlist is \naccurately maintained, DHS has established that only TFC program staff can place a child on the \nwaitlist.   \nBy gathering more comprehensive information through the new Application about each child’s \nneeds, diagnosis to date and placement and behavioral histories, DHS is in a better position to \ncommunicate and match the needs of a child to available homes managed by the TFC agencies.  \nDHS reports the new Application has helped to reduce the amount of time a child remains on \nthe waitlist prior to being placed in a TFC home. To support more timely placements, DHS also \ncontinued through this review period to host weekly calls with the TFC agencies to review \nchildren waiting for a TFC placement and discuss available and possible TFC home matches.  \nDHS has reported that it is reassessing the best structure and schedule for these child specific \nplacement  reviews  as  program  staff  believe  they  can  be  managed  more  efficiently  and \neffectively for DHS and the participating agencies.  \nDHS reported that since May 2017, when the department began to use the Application, there \nhas been a steady decrease in the number of children for whom DHS submits an Application to \nOHCA for TFC approval. DHS also reported that it cannot pinpoint one reason why the number \nof Applications and requests for TFC placements has declined from 133 in May 2017, to 78 in \nJuly 2017 and 48 in September 2017.  DHS ended the year with 62 Applications submitted in \nDecember 2017.  However, DHS reported that child welfare staff and TFC staff alike have \nbecome more familiar with the information gathered for the Application, particularly regarding \na child’s treatment history and diagnoses, and will identify upfront which requests OHCA will \ndeny. This expanded awareness can lead DHS to pre-emptively end the Application process and \nnot submit the request to OHCA. However, given the significant decrease in the number of TFC \nplacement authorization requests submitted to OHCA, DHS needs to ensure that children who \nneed and could be authorized for TFC services are supported through the full TFC Application \nand placement process.  \nDHS noted the primary reasons OHCA denies TFC authorization requests include a child having \na developmental level or disability that does not meet the TFC authorization criteria, and a child \nhaving behavioral challenges and needs that are too acute to be met in a family-based setting, \nincluding a TFC home.15  That said, DHS still needs more TFC homes to best care for children \nwho do meet the TFC placement criteria. In addition, the department also needs therapeutic \nplacements (family-based and higher-level) that can meet the behavioral and developmental \nneeds of children who are not approved for TFC homes.  \n                                                      \n15 Children who are diagnosed with a developmental disability are not eligible for a TFC placement. \n33 \n \n\nQuality of Therapeutic Services and Care in TFC Homes  \nThrough its qualitative review of therapeutic diagnoses, treatment plans and services for 65 TFC \nplaced children, which DHS completed over one year ago, DHS found various deficiencies in the \nquality and individualized nature of the services these children received.  To address the \nidentified concerns regarding the quality and effectiveness of TFC treatment services, DHS \ncommitted through its January 2017 enhanced core strategies to establish a multi-disciplinary \nstaffing team for each child, which would include a mental health consultant for children \nentering or already placed in a TFC home, as well as the child’s permanency caseworker.   \nTo meet this commitment, DHS sought to leverage the OHCA requirement that each TFC child’s \nindividual treatment plan and clinical progress be assessed every 90 days.   Specifically, DHS \ncommitted that its TFC liaisons would coordinate efforts between TFC providers and DHS \ncaseworkers and field staff to prepare for each child’s 90-day assessment and treatment team \nmeeting. Although the 90-day assessment has been a long-standing requirement, DHS and \nprivate agency representatives reported that the assigned permanency caseworkers, although \nprovided a standing invitation to these reviews, generally do not participate in these 90-day \nassessments. Clearly there is value in a child’s permanency caseworker participating in these \nregularly scheduled sessions, including to ensure everyone has a shared understanding of a \nchild’s permanency and treatment goals, objectives and progress.  At the same time, DHS \nrecognizes  that  caseworkers  do  not  always  have  the  clinical  expertise  to  assess  a  child’s \ntreatment needs and progress and, as a result, committed to supporting caseworkers and these \ndiscussions with DHS’ in-house mental health consultants.   \nAs previously reported by the Co-Neutrals, a lack of staff resources and organizational capacity \nin the TFC program resulted in DHS not initiating this commitment during the last period.  \nInstead, DHS reported in October 2017 that it shifted to establish a pilot group, focused on one \nTFC agency, to implement a “standardized process for these reviews that allows for more focus \non  the  quality of  care the  children  are  receiving  than  tracking down  staff for paperwork \ncompletion.”  DHS further reported in October 2017 that its goal was to implement a similar \nprocess with several other TFC agencies during the following few months.   \nAfter the period ended, in March 2018, DHS reported that the one participating agency in the \npilot group reported that “scheduling and maintaining vigilant contact with the [permanency \ncaseworker] assigned has increased their participation in the 90-day reviews.” The Co-Neutrals \nare concerned this is the only progress DHS has reported with respect to assessing whether \nchildren receive quality therapeutic care in the TFC program. While DHS has reported that it is \nencouraging all TFC agencies to take a similar approach and be more vigilant in coordinating \nwith assigned caseworkers, the department has not specified what, if any, agency-wide plans or \n34 \n \n\ncommunications it developed to offer guidance or stress the importance to its caseworkers to \nparticipate in these treatment review sessions if a child assigned to them is placed in a TFC.   \nAs of March 2018, the department had still not gathered any particular findings regarding the \ntherapeutic diagnoses, treatment plans and quality of services for the reviewed children despite \nDHS reporting the goal of its single agency pilot was to focus on the quality of care children \nreceive, rather than tracking down caseworkers.   \nDHS reported, after the end of the period, that a Master of Social Work practicum student was \nbeginning to work with DHS’ mental health consultants to focus on 20 children and conduct “a \nnew type of review to better focus on the quality of care and actual treatment the children are \nreceiving while placed at the TFC agencies.”  For this review, DHS selected 20 children who have \nbeen in a TFC placement for over three years in order to “better understand the lack of clinical \nprogress, specifically with these children, and through review opportunities better understand \nwhat is needed for the child to be successful.”  The Co-Neutrals will report on DHS’ efforts and \nany available findings from this review in their next Commentary. \nDHS and the Co-Neutrals have discussed concerns about the quality of TFC services and the \npreparedness and willingness of TFC families to meet the higher-level needs of children placed \nin TFC-approved homes. Although DHS identified concerns with the quality of TFC treatment \nservices through its 2016 child case review, the department’s focus to address these concerns \nhas been modest, at best.  As a result, DHS has not reported any meaningful improvements to \nthe quality of the treatment and therapeutic services children in these homes receive.    \nTFC Program Improvement Efforts: Maltreatment in Care, Placement Stability and Training \nDHS  made  efforts  to  address  the  disproportionate  rate  of  maltreatment  experienced  by \nchildren in TFC homes when compared to other family-based placements for the period of \nOctober 2015 through September 2016.  Through new provisions included in the department’s \nSFY18  contracts  with  the  TFC  agencies,  DHS  required  several  specific  remedial  actions  to \naddress confirmed incidents of maltreatment or potential safety risks identified through a \nmaltreatment investigation or referral.  DHS’ most recent maltreatment data for this period \nshowed a reduction in the number of child maltreatment substantiations in TFC homes. \nWith respect to placement stability, DHS sought, also through new contract provisions, to \nreduce  placement  disruptions  in  TFC  homes  through  monetary  sanctions  against  the  TFC \nagencies.  DHS established that an agency would be sanctioned $250 per placement disruption \nwhen the numbers of placement disruptions exceeded the number of successful placement \ntransitions (i.e., moving to a kinship home or trial reunification) an agency makes during each \nmonth of SFY18.  DHS reported that it issued a total of 16 monetary sanctions during the six-\nmonth period of July through December 2017.  \n35 \n \n\nRegarding the specialized pre-service training that TFC foster parents receive to advance their \nskill set and abilities to safely meet the therapeutic needs of children with behavioral and \nemotional challenges, DHS identified the need to establish a different training program for TFC \nhomes.  Through its analysis of the TFC program in 2016, DHS found that some TFC resource \nfamilies had not acquired the ability to meet the higher acuity needs of children who DHS \nplaces in TFC homes. This identified lack of skill and preparation has contributed to placement \ninstability and maltreatment in TFC homes. DHS found that the supplemental training (Behavior \nCrisis Management Training), which all TFC families must complete in addition to the 27-hour \ntraining (Guiding Principles) that all other foster parents must complete, was outdated and \nendorses  the  use  of  physical  therapeutic  holds,  which  can  escalate  physical  encounters \nbetween children and their TFC caregivers.  After partnering with its consultants to review and \nevaluate several other training modules used across the country, DHS selected a new pre-\nservice training model (Pressley Ridge TFC) for all TFC families starting in July 2018.  Further, \nstarting in August 2018, all new families certified as a TFC home will complete only this training \nand not have to complete the Guiding Principles training required of all traditional and kinship \nfoster homes.16  \nDHS TFC Program Staff and Capacity \nThe Co-Neutrals have stressed to DHS that additional efforts are needed to expand the state’s \npool and continuum of therapeutic, family-based placements as the TFC program has continued \nto shrink every report period, as represented by: the number of open, available homes; the \nnumber of partner agencies recruiting and managing TFC homes in Oklahoma; the number of \nDHS staff managing the state’s TFC program; the number of children placed in TFC homes and \nthe number of children authorized for TFC level services.  \nThroughout this report period and since the beginning of this reform effort, DHS’ TFC program \noffice has operated with an inadequate number of staff, which has impacted the strength of \nthis program and impaired DHS’ implementation of its core strategies, particularly with respect \nto the department’s commitment to conduct regular, structured reviews to ensure children are \nreceiving quality and effective therapeutic services. DHS reports the department began to hire \nmore staff for the TFC unit beginning in late 2017. \nOver the last several years, DHS acknowledged it had exhausted options to adequately meet \nthe  needs  of  children  requiring  family-based  therapeutic  services  by  relying  solely  on \nOklahoma’s  existing  TFC  program.  DHS  leadership  shared  that  the  department  needed to \n                                                      \n16 DHS reports that the exception will be for TFC families who may later decide to adopt a child in DHS custody: \nthese families also will have to complete the Guiding Principles training required of traditional, kinship and \nadoptive families.  \n36 \n \n\nexplore a different approach to build its continuum of therapeutic, family-based placements for \nchildren in DHS custody who present with varying levels of behavioral, emotional, development \nand medical diagnoses and needs.  In the meantime, DHS continued to work with its contracted \nTFC agencies to restructure the processes, as discussed above, used within the current TFC \nprogram and focus its efforts to expand foster homes with therapeutic services by supporting \nits  TFC  agency  partners  with  recruitment  training  offered  by  the  department’s  national \nconsultants.   \nIn this report period, the Co-Neutrals raised concerns with DHS regarding the low number of \nnew TFC  homes  that had  been  developed,  with  only  nine new  TFC  homes  developed  by \nSeptember 31, 2017 and zero new TFC home approvals recorded for the month of September.  \nThe Co-Neutrals met with DHS leadership to urge the department to explore additional family-\nbased therapeutic models that can support the stability, permanency and well-being of children \nin DHS custody whose caregivers may require additional, specialized supports and services to \nmeet a child’s behavioral and emotional needs.   \nThe Co-Neutrals suggested that DHS revisit a review of the state’s Systems of Care (SOC) \nservices  that  are  coordinated  through  the  Oklahoma  Department  of  Mental  Health  and \nSubstance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) to assess if the SOC services provided to children in DHS \ncustody and their family-based caregivers represented a form of therapeutic foster care that \nDHS could maximize through expanded access for children in out of home care.17, 18 \nAlthough  the  Co-Neutrals  previously  understood  from  DHS  that  access  to  SOC  services \nstatewide was limited, DHS and ODMHSAS reported in October 2017 that the SOC program was \nserving 6,500 children (mostly children not in DHS custody) across the state, in 77 counties with \ntwo to three providers per county and three to five SOC teams per provider. DHS’ liaison to the \nSOC program reported that DHS had underutilized SOC and that the service providers under the \nSOC umbrella had as much training, if not more, than those providing services through the TFC \nprogram.   \n                                                      \n17 In SFY16, DHS had identified expanded statewide access to SOC services for child in custody as a core strategy to \nimprove placement stability outcomes, starting with embedding SOC coordinators in DHS’ Region 4 offices.  DHS \nlater reported that the availability of SOC services was limited statewide, which led to DHS and the Co-Neutrals \nagreeing that SOC services would not remain a part of the department’s strategy to advance placement stability.  \n18 Oklahoma policy states that its System of Care is a framework that offers a comprehensive array of behavioral \nhealth and other support services organized into a coordinated network to meet the multiple and changing needs \nof children with serious emotional disturbances and their families.  SOC offers services that are individualized to \neach child, family, and community, and includes services that are strengths-based and grounded in partnerships \nwith families that include case management, collaboration with all child-serving agencies and a philosophy of \nwraparound services.  \n37 \n \n\nThe Co-Neutrals offered to work with DHS to conduct a case record review of children in DHS \ncustody  who  receive  SOC  services  to  assess  if  the  SOC  and  TFC  programs  provide \ncommensurate therapeutic supports and if a child in the SOC program, while placed in a regular \nkinship or traditional foster home, could “count” toward DHS’ Target Outcome for therapeutic \nfoster care.  Unfortunately, an initial assessment of the 240 children in DHS custody who were \nreported as receiving SOC treatment services found that only 14 of these children (six percent) \nreceived 12 or more hours of services per month, the minimum service hours that ODMHSAS \nestablished for the SOC program.  In fact, the data showed that the majority of children \nreceived well below the established service standard for the program.  \nAt  this  point,  the  Co-Neutrals  and  DHS  agree  that  the  billing  data  and  case  information \nreviewed for the SOC program and services do not indicate that SOC services can be considered \nequivalent to TFC services, which requires a therapist to provide two hours of service each \nweek (one hour with the child alone and one hour with the child and their TFC caregiver(s)) and \nthat the trained TFC parents conduct therapeutic work with the child for 1.5 hours every day.  \nAlthough the SOC-serviced homes will not be counted in the state’s pool of therapeutic foster \nhomes at this time, the Co-Neutrals encourage DHS to continue discussions and qualitative \nreviews with ODMHSAS to evaluate how the SOC statewide network of service providers can \nbest support outcomes for children in DHS custody and assess where the state can expand on \nany successes that the SOC program can report for children in care.  As discussed further below \nin the placement stability section of this Commentary, DHS has since revisited use of SOC as a \nstrategy to help prevent placement disruptions and support stability in foster homes that can \nsafely meet the needs of children who present with behavioral challenges.   \nAt the end of this report period and prior to completing the review of the SOC claims data and \nselected records for children in custody, DHS included as one of three revised core strategies \nthe hopeful anticipation (of both DHS and the Co-Neutrals) that SOC-serviced homes could help \nsupplement the state’s reported pool of therapeutic foster homes toward the Target Outcome \nfor TFCs.  Another strategy included in DHS’ December 2017 revised TFC core strategies is a \nplan to convert traditional foster homes to new TFC homes that would count toward the Target \nOutcome.  As a first step in this strategy, DHS committed to develop for the Co-Neutrals’ review \nand approval a proposed protocol to convert these homes.19  \nThe remaining strategy that DHS proposed to support its contracted TFC agencies to recruit \nmore TFC homes was assigning one DHS traditional foster home recruiter to partner with one \nTFC agency and “work events and other recruitment activities together to bring in families \n                                                      \n19 Currently, the criteria for counting new TFC homes do not allow DHS to count homes that are already open as a \ntraditional foster home.   \n38 \n \n\nspecifically for the TFC program.”  Through a shared exchange of resources, DHS proposed that \nthe TFC agencies would train the DHS recruiters on the various particulars and information \nrelevant  for  recruiting  TFC  homes  and  DHS  would  develop  new  TFC  home  recruitment \nmaterials.  As this strategy was proposed at the end of the report period, the Co-Neutrals will \nprovide an update on this effort in their next Commentary.   \nNew Staff Assigned to DHS’ TFC Program \nIn December 2017, DHS further committed to develop a new staff position in the TFC program \nto  serve  as  the  “recruitment  navigator/coordinator”  for  new families  coming  through  the \nrecruitment pipeline and manage the process to convert existing resource families to TFC \nhomes.  DHS reported in May 2018 that the new position was approved and was posted for \napplicants in April 2018, with the selected individual expected to be hired and in the position no \nlater than July 1, 2018.   \nIn addition, DHS announced after the end of the period that it had decided to add to the TFC \nprogram office a special unit focused on the statewide recruitment of homes for children with \ndevelopmental disabilities (e.g. agency companion homes). DHS is moving this unit of recruiters \n(one supervisor and five child welfare specialists) from DHS’ Developmental Disabilities Services \n(DDS) program office to the TFC program where these specialists will conduct recruitment \nactivities for both TFC and DDS homes to expand the capacity to care for children with higher-\nlevel needs in family-like settings. DHS further reported after the end of the period that it \nplanned to hire one additional child welfare specialist (III) to support the daily programmatic \noperations of the TFC unit.  \nIn DHS’ most recent statewide core strategy update to the Co-Neutrals in May 2018, the \ndepartment reported that it was “going to focus on thinking through alternative options to the \ncurrent TFC model since the recruitment and retention activities by the private TFC providers is \nnot a long-term sustainable plan for any of them to continue engaging in this work.”  DHS and \nthe Co-Neutrals have agreed on this for several years now.  This does not mean that DHS’ \ncurrent TFC agency partners and TFC homes do not continue to be a valuable component of \nOklahoma’s continuum of care.  However, DHS must now take aggressive and focused actions \nto bridge the state’s placement gap of family-based therapeutic care for children with various \nlevels of specialized needs and fully engage in this alternate planning.   \nThe Co-Neutrals also encourage DHS to actively support the current TFC agencies on ways to \nimplement effectively the recruitment training its TFC partners received over the last year.  \nDuring a meeting of DHS and the TFC agencies in early November 2017, the Co-Neutrals \nobserved that there was minimal discussion and strategizing on how to expand recruitment of \n39 \n \n\nnew TFCs, as well as no coordinated discussion of how to apply the approaches and skills \ntransferred to the agencies through their new training.   \nThe outcome of only 19 new TFC homes developed over six months reflects inadequate efforts \nto achieve progress toward the Target Outcome. While DHS presented several new strategies at \nthe end of this report period, as well as some resources to help expand the state’s family-based \ntherapeutic resources, DHS’ efforts to grow its pool of TFC resources were unfocused, untimely \nand under-resourced during this report period.  As a result, DHS reported a net loss of 55 TFC \nresources over the six months ending in December 2017.  The Co-Neutrals do not find that DHS \nmade good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the new home \ndevelopment and net gain Target Outcomes for TFC resources for this report period. \nC.  Caseworker Caseloads and Supervisor Workloads \nEstablishing and maintaining manageable caseloads for child welfare caseworkers is essential to \nchild safety, well-being and permanency. DHS committed to achieve the following caseload \nstandards for child welfare workers and workload standard for supervisors:   \nTable 2: Pinnacle Plan Caseload and Workload Standard Commitments \nRole  Standards  Weight Per Case \nCPS  12 Open Investigations or Assessments  0.0833 \nOCA  12 Open Investigations  0.0833 \nFamily Centered  8 Families  0.125 \nSPeerrvmicaense ncy Planning  15 Children  0.0667 \nResource Family  22 Families  0.0455 \nSApdeocpiatiloisnt   16 Children   0.0625 \nSupervisors  1 Supervisor Dedicated to 5 Workers  0.2 per worker \n \nDuring this report period, DHS maintained caseload performance substantially better than its \nbaseline at the outset of this effort.  That said, during the period DHS continued to experience a \ndramatic increase in the number of referrals accepted for investigation, specifically during the \nsummer and early fall of 2017. This contributed to a sharp rise in the number of overdue \nmaltreatment investigations.  As of November 2017, the backlog of overdue child maltreatment \ninvestigations had reached more than 800 cases. The increase in investigations contributed to a \ndecline in caseload compliance, which was further evidenced during the reporting period by a \ndivergence in two critical data points: total workload (all cases assigned and managed) and the \nworkload capacity DHS caseworkers are eligible to carry under the caseload standards.  By the \n40 \n \n\nend of September 2017, DHS’ data showed that for the first time since the summer of 2016 \ntotal workload exceeded total workload capacity.  \nAs a result, DHS did not make gains in the number of caseworkers meeting caseload standards, \nand in fact, reported a decline in caseload performance by the end of the period (December 31, \n2017) as compared to the end of the previous period (June 30, 2017). As investigations surged \nduring the period, and the CPS backlog grew, DHS proactively developed and implemented a \nWorkload Improvement Plan (WIP) to hire more workers, maximize existing workforce capacity \nby  temporarily  increasing  the  number  of  cases  a  new  caseworker  can  carry  under  the \ndepartment’s graduated caseload program and launching an overtime plan.20  DHS’ data shows \nthat  while  the  number  of  caseworkers  meeting  caseload  standards  declined  this  period \ncompared to the previous reporting period, DHS was able by the end of the period to improve \nits performance from its lowest ebb during the period. The  department also reduced the \nnumber of CPS cases overdue for resolution, which totaled 618 on December 31, 2017, and \nreduced the number of workers carrying a caseload over 200 percent of the caseload standard.  \nDHS responded with focus to the workload challenges encountered this period and made good \nfaith efforts to protect the substantial and sustained progress it has made toward the Target \nOutcomes in prior periods.     \nTo achieve its caseload Target Outcomes in 2018, DHS developed a Workload and Hiring Plan \nthat commits the department to hire 547 caseworkers by December 31, 2018 and includes \ndistrict-specific plans to support hiring and retention goals.  The Co-Neutrals will continue to \nmonitor  DHS’  implementation  of  its  Workload  and  Hiring  Plan  to  assess  whether  the \ndepartment continues to make good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress \ntoward the Target Outcomes. \nPerformance – Target Outcomes \nQuarterly Caseload Data (October-December 2017) \nDHS reports that 67.9 percent of all caseworkers met the established caseload standard for the \nlast three months of the period (October 1, 2017 – December 31, 2017). Since last period, DHS’ \nquarterly  caseload  performance  declined  from  71.8  percent  of  caseworkers  meeting  the \ncaseload standard.   \n \n \n                                                      \n20 In February 2018, DHS made permanent the modified graduated caseload assignments, which is discussed in \ngreater detail in this section.   \n41 \n \n\nFigure 10: Worker Caseloads: Percent of Workers Meeting Caseload Standards \n80.0%\n71.8% \n68.9%  67.9% \n66.0% \n70.0%\n55.5% \n60.0%\n49.1% \n50.0%\n40.0% 35.0% \n31.2% \n27.0% \n30.0%\n20.0%\n10.0%\n \n0.0%  \nBaseline June 2014Dec 2014June 2015Dec 2015June 2016Dec 20 16June 2017Dec 2017\n \n            Source: DHS Data \n \nDHS’ quarterly performance for the first three months of this report period (July 1, 2017 – \nSeptember 30, 2017) showed a slight improvement in performance compared to caseloads in \nthe preceding quarter (April 1, 2017 – June 30, 2017) of the last period.   For the first three \nmonths of the current period, DHS reports that 72 percent of caseworkers met the caseload \nstandard.  The decline in caseload performance from the first to second quarter (72 percent to \n67.9  percent)  of  this  report  period  was  largely  due  to  the  steadily  increasing  number  of \ninvestigations assigned to caseworkers. The spike in assigned cases peaked in mid-October \n2017, which corresponded to DHS’ lowest caseload performance during the six-month period. \nPoint in Time Caseload Data  \nAccording to the point in time (PIT) data from the end of this report period, DHS reports that \n70.5 percent of all caseworkers met the established standard on December 31, 2017.  When \ncompared to the PIT data at the end of the last report period, DHS’ compliance decreased by \n9.6 percent from 80.1 percent.   \nOn December 31, 2017, caseload compliance by worker type varied, as detailed in Table 3 \nbelow.  Recruitment workers maintained the highest caseload compliance (94.7 percent), while \nATU workers maintained the lowest (42.7 percent).  \n \n \n42 \n \n\nTable 3:  Caseload Compliance by Worker Type – December 31, 2017 \n% \nWORKER TYPE  MET  TOTAL \nMEETING \nINVESTIGATION  259  411  63.0% \nPERMANENCY PLANNING  514  725  70.9% \nPREVENTIVE / VOLUNTARY  56  83  67.5% \nFOSTER CARE / ADOPTION  216  260  83.1% \nATU  16  38  42.1% \nRECRUITMENT  36  38  94.7% \nTOTAL  1097  1555  70.5% \n \nCauses of Decline in Caseload Compliance this Period  \nRise in Investigative Cases \nDuring  this  period,  DHS’  data  showed  a  marked  increase  in  the  number  of  accepted \ninvestigations compared to last period. In October 2017, caseworkers were responsible for \n1,379 more investigations than at the end of June 2017.  This reflects a nearly 30 percent \nincrease in CPS cases in just over three months.  This substantial increase in investigative cases \nplaced  tremendous  pressure  on  caseworkers  who  were  assigned  many  more  cases  to \ninvestigate.    For  example,  caseworkers  in  Oklahoma  City  were  responsible  for  484  more \ninvestigations in October than in June, and Tulsa caseworkers had 237 more investigations \nadded to their caseloads.   \nFigure 11 : Investigative Cases, June 2017 to December 2017 \n6,500\n6,089  6,121 \n6,000\n5,659 \n5,334 \n5,500\n4,938 \n5,000 4,742  4,725 \n4,500\n4,000\n3,500\n \n3,000  \nJune 2017 July 2017 Aug 2017 Sept 2017 Oct 2017 Nov 2017  Dec 2017\nSource: DHS Data \n \n43 \n \n\nThe increase in investigations resulted in a drop in caseload compliance.  In October 2017, only \n65 percent of caseworkers met the caseload standard, a drop of 15 percentage points from \nJune 2017.  Some workers and districts experienced the rise in workload even more acutely.  \nFor example, caseload compliance for investigators fell from 72 percent compliance in June \n2017 to just over half (51 percent) of investigators meeting the standard on October 17, 2017. \nBy  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  DHS’  efforts  through  the  implementation  of  its  WIP \nreversed these troubling trends and positioned the agency to make gains again. \nAt the  end of  the report period,  DHS  reported  having onboard  1,695  case  carrying  staff, \nincluding 1,555 who were managing at least one case. Of the remaining 140 caseworkers not \ncarrying  a  case,  105  were  still early  in their  training  and not  yet eligible  to  receive  case \nassignments.  This is the largest reported increase of caseworkers on board, but not yet eligible \nto carry cases, since March 30, 2016, when there were 135 new caseworkers in this status. The \nincrease in the number of new staff between periods demonstrates that DHS continued to hire \nand move new caseworkers through the pre-service training program.  \nDHS reported that despite its hiring to backfill positions, the department experienced a net loss \nof staff due to turnover. Since June 28, 2017, the total number of caseworkers statewide \ndecreased by 43 from 1,738 to 1,695 caseworkers as of December 31, 2017.  Further, the \nnumber of case-carrying staff decreased by 66, from 1,621 last period to 1,555 this period.    \nThe result of DHS’ staff attrition was a loss in the total case carrying capacity of all caseworkers \non board for the period.  \nWorkload Performance Improvement Plan   \nDHS  developed  and  implemented  its  WIP,  effective  October  31,  2017,  to  respond  to  the \nincrease in the investigative caseload and the simultaneous net decrease in the number of \ncaseload carrying staff. (See Appendix C)  In its plan, DHS articulated:  \n“An increase in the number of overdue investigations and assessments combined with an \nincrease in the overall number of pending, is an indication that if we do not make \nadjustments quickly, we will lose the workforce stability we’ve diligently worked to \nachieve.  Therefore, in addition to expediting recruitment, hiring and onboarding efforts \nto ensure the right number of staff are in place, immediate adjustments in workload \ndistribution are required to stabilize the workforce.” \nThe plan consists of the following three primary strategies to increase workload capacity:  \n1.  Adjustment to graduated workload standard.  DHS implemented graduated caseloads in \n2015  as  a  central  strategy  to  increase  retention  of  new  workers.    The  original \ncommitment was to assign new caseworkers, after finishing CORE training, 25 percent of \n44 \n \n\na caseload for the first three months on the job.  Subsequently, at six months, a worker \nis assigned a 50 percent workload and at nine months, a full caseload of 100 percent.  \nDHS  effectively  implemented  graduated  caseloads  and  protected  most  of  its  new \nworkers from being assigned a full caseload prior to nine months on the job.  For \nexample, last period, 91 percent of caseworkers eligible for graduated caseloads met \ntheir 25 or 50 percent caseload standard. \nTo increase workload capacity, DHS modified the graduated workload standards from 25 \nto 50 percent of a workload for the first three months, and at six months, from 50 to 75 \npercent of a workload.  DHS reported by increasing graduated caseload assignments, \nthe department would have greater workload capacity. DHS instructed supervisors to \ngive careful consideration to new workers’ individual skill level and development when \nmaking graduated caseload assignments as some new caseworkers may need to start \nwith a lighter workload. \nDHS  leadership  and  the  Co-Neutrals  separately  received  extensive  feedback  from \nworkers in the field that the original 25 percent graduated caseload for new workers \nwas often not demanding enough, while the subsequent jump from 50 to 100 percent of \na caseload at nine months was too much of an increase for some new workers to \nmanage  effectively.  On  December  31,  2017,  using  the  new  graduated  caseload \nassignments,  DHS  reported  that  97  percent  of  staff  eligible  to  carry  a  graduated \ncaseload met the standard.  Effective February 16, 2018, DHS made permanent the \nmodified graduated caseload methodology.     \n2.  Adjustment to workload standard.  For the 11 districts that did not have the workforce \ncapacity to meet their total assigned workload as of October 30, 2017, DHS temporarily \nrevised their workload target and allowed supervisors to increase the number of cases \nboth investigators and permanency workers could carry to distribute the burgeoning \nworkload more evenly.  DHS leadership temporarily allowed for permanency workers to \nbe assigned an additional three children (18 children total) and CPS investigators to be \nassigned an additional two cases (14 cases total).21    \n \n3.  Overtime plans.    For those districts with the highest number of investigations and \nassessments  in  backlog  status,  DHS  utilized  overtime  plans  to  increase  workforce \ncapacity.   \n                                                      \n21 The revised workload standard is used only by DHS as an internal management strategy for those districts that \ndo not have a sufficient workforce to meet their total workload.  DHS continues to report caseload compliance to \nthe Co-Neutrals using the original caseload standards, which have not changed.   \n45 \n \n\nInitial Progress after WIP Implementation \nFollowing the implementation of the WIP in late October 2017, DHS’ data at the end of the \nperiod indicates improvement in these areas:  \n1.  Increased number of caseworkers meeting the caseload standard.  At the end of June \n2017, 80.1 percent of caseworkers met the caseload standard.  By the middle of the \ncurrent period, only 65 percent of workers met the standard.  During November and \nDecember 2017, the percent of caseworkers meeting the caseload standard steadily \nincreased.  The average caseload compliance for November 2017 was 68.6 percent and \nfor December 2017 was 69.3 percent.  By the end of December 2017, 63 additional \nworkers were meeting the caseload standard when compared to October 1, 2017. \n \n2.  Rise  in  total  workforce  capacity.    At  the  end  of  June  2017,  DHS  reported  a  total \nworkforce  capacity  of  1,525.    By  mid-October  2017,  total  workforce  capacity  had \ndropped to 1,449, representing a deficit against the 1,507 total workload assignments. \nDuring November and December 2017, total workforce capacity progressively increased \nand by December 31, 2017, reached 1,495. \n \n3.  Reduction in CPS investigative cases.  During the period, DHS significantly reduced the \ntotal number of investigative cases assigned to caseworkers. At the end of the period, \nDHS reported 4,938 investigative cases, a nearly 20 percent drop in cases from mid-\nperiod when the total number of investigative cases exceeded 6,000.  At the close of last \nperiod, DHS reported 349 cases in its backlog.  During the current period, the backlog \nhad reached over 800 overdue investigations. At the end of December 2017, DHS’ data \nshowed 618 cases in overdue, backlog status.  \n \n4.  Drop in the number of caseworkers carrying a caseload over 200 percent.  During the \nfirst half of the current period, the number of caseworkers with a caseload over 200 \npercent of their respective standard more than tripled from 18 caseworkers in July 2017 \nto 65 in October 2017.  On December 31, 2017, DHS reported only 14 caseworkers with \na caseload over 200 percent, a nearly 80 percent reduction from October 2017. \nThese improvements reversed worsening trend lines on key caseload indicators and averted a \nmore significant downturn in DHS’ caseload performance for this period.  \nWorkload and Hiring Plan \nIn March 2018, DHS began implementation of a statewide Workload and Hiring Plan that \nestablishes the roadmap for DHS to achieve its caseload Target Outcomes this year. (See \n46 \n \n\nAppendix D) The plan consists of a hiring strategy to bring onboard by December 31, 2018, 547 \nnew staff across DHS’ 27 districts and foster care and adoption units.  Of these 547 positions, \nDHS reports 276 are positions currently vacant and the remaining 271 positions will need to be \nbackfilled due to DHS turnover estimates. To establish its hiring plan, DHS used historical \nworkload data to project, by district, the number of staff needed not only to meet, but exceed, \ntotal workload assigned.  In its plan, DHS stated, “…DHS must ensure it has adequate staff hired \nand able to carry cases so that the capacity is greater than the workload.”   \nA review of DHS’ data at the end of this period shows that 21 of the 29 child welfare districts in \nOklahoma had the capacity to either meet or exceed their total workload, without accounting \nfor projected attrition, while eight districts did not have sufficient caseworker staffing capacity \nto meet their total workload.  Of the eight districts that did not have the caseworker staffing \ncapacity to meet their total workload, three districts required three or fewer additional workers \nto meet their total workload.  DHS’ hiring plan includes hiring a sufficient number of additional \nstaff for each of these eight districts to exceed their current total workload.  \nWhile most districts had the capacity to meet or exceed their total workload at the end of the \nperiod, DHS’ data shows that the majority of districts (72 percent or 21 out of the 29 districts) \ndid not meet 90 percent caseload compliance on December 31, 2017.22  The disparity between \nthese two data points (most districts have either the capacity to meet or exceed their workload \nand most districts’ caseworkers did not meet the caseload standard) reflects the reality that \nwhile a district may have enough staff to meet its total workload, the distribution of work in a \ndistrict between the types of workers and types of cases assigned often do not align. These \nrealities support DHS’ commitment to hire a sufficient number of staff to exceed a district’s \ntotal workload in order for districts to be able to effectively respond to the daily fluctuations in \nthe type, volume and special characteristics of a district’s total workload.   \n \n \n                                                      \n22 Of the 21 districts where caseworkers did not meet 90 percent caseload compliance, six districts’ caseworkers \nhad between 80 and 89 percent compliance; seven districts between 60 and 79 percent compliance; and the \nremaining eight districts’ caseworkers had below 60 percent caseload compliance.  It is important to highlight that \nwhile a district’s caseworkers may not collectively meet 90 percent caseload compliance, some of that district’s \ncaseworkers  may  carry  caseloads  in  compliance.    For  example,  District  17  reported  75  percent  caseload \ncompliance on December 31, 2017.  While this district did not meet the 90 percent standard, 21 of the district’s 28 \ncaseworkers’ caseloads met the standard. \n47 \n \n\nFigure 12 : District Capacity to Cover Workload and Caseload Compliance23 \nCapacity to  Capacity to  90% of \n% of Workers \nDistrict  Cover  Cover  Workers \nMeeting Std. \nWorkload  Workload  Meeting Std. \n1  145%  Y  Y  100% \n2  137%  Y  N  89% \n3  119%  Y  N  82% \n4  102%  Y  N  61% \n5  121%  Y  N  80% \n6  87%  N  N  43% \n7  105%  Y  N  71% \n8  86%  N  N  38% \n9  135%  Y  Y  93% \n10  66%  N  N  50% \n11  134%  Y  Y  95% \n12  130%  Y  N  86% \n13  110%  Y  N  67% \n14  81%  N  N  35% \n15  138%  Y  Y  93% \n16  154%  Y  Y  96% \n17  122%  Y  N  75% \n18  111%  Y  N  82% \n19  110%  Y  N  74% \n20  92%  N  N  48% \n21  93%  N  N  55% \n22  144%  Y  Y  100% \n23  137%  Y  Y  92% \n24  122%  Y  Y  93% \n25  98%  N  N  50% \n26  91%  N  N  37% \n27  109%  Y  N  66% \nAdoption  146%  Y  N  72% \nFoster Care  115%  Y  N  83% \nSTATE   109%  Y  N  70.5% \n                                                      \n23 In the Figure, a district shaded yellow means that the district has the workforce capacity to meet its total \nworkload, however, has less than 90 percent of its caseworkers meeting the caseload standard; a district shaded \nred means that the district does not have the workforce capacity to meet its total workload and less than 90 \npercent of its caseworkers are meeting the caseload standard; and a district shaded green means that the district \nhas the capacity to meet its total workload and at least 90 percent of its caseworkers are meeting the caseload \nstandard. \n48 \n \n\nOf the 21 districts not meeting 90 percent caseload compliance at the end of the period, seven \ndistricts reported having 50 percent or fewer caseworkers meeting the caseload standard.  For \nthese districts, many of which have persistently struggled with low caseload compliance, DHS \nmust be particularly focused in its efforts to improve caseload compliance.  In its hiring plan, \nDHS identified most of these seven districts as requiring greater managerial attention to fill \ntheir vacant positions, which has been a challenge noted by DHS.   \nIncluded in DHS’ Workload and Hiring Plan is an individual plan for each region, and its districts, \nto accomplish each district’s specific hiring and retention goals by December 31, 2018. The \nplans set forth a diverse set of strategies unique to specific regional/district needs, which \ninclude strengthening tracking, monitoring and managing of caseloads; improving the selection \nprocess  to  ensure  the  right  candidates  are  hired;  and,  supporting  caseworkers  through \nimproved mechanisms for staff to provide feedback.  For many of the seven districts with 50 \npercent or fewer caseworkers meeting the caseload standard, regional plans include strategies \nto  leverage  personnel  among  better-staffed  districts  and  these  under-staffed  districts  to \nmaximize staffing and case assignments.   \nThe last component of DHS’ Workload and Hiring Plan involves a commitment to reduce the \npercent of staff carrying excessively large caseloads.  DHS has committed to:  \n(cid:120)  By July 1, 2018, no staff will have a caseload that exceeds 200 percent of standard;  \n(cid:120)  By October 1, 2018, no staff will have a caseload that exceeds 175 percent of standard; \nand, \n(cid:120)  By December 31, 2018, no staff will have a caseload that exceeds 150 percent of \nstandard. \nAs noted above, by the end of December 2017, 14 of 1,555 caseworkers carrying at least one \ncase had a caseload that exceeded 200 percent of standard, bringing within reach DHS’ first \ngoal  of  eliminating  its  largest  caseloads.  The  Co-Neutrals  will  closely  monitor  DHS’ \nimplementation of its Workload and Hiring Plan and continue to assess the Department’s \nefforts to make meaningful gains in caseload compliance.  \nPerformance Standards and Target Outcomes – Supervisor Workloads  \nDHS understands that strong supervisory support for caseworkers, especially new caseworkers, \nis essential to supporting effective and consistent child welfare practice and positive outcomes \nfor children and families. DHS committed to meet the same final Target Outcome for supervisor \nworkloads as it did for caseloads: 90 percent of supervisors meeting the 1:5 caseworker ratio.   \nAs of December 31, 2017, DHS’ data showed that 84.6 percent of supervisors met the 1:5 \nworkload standard, compared to 83.5 percent on June 28, 2017.  As the chart below shows, \n49 \n \n\nover this reform effort, DHS has made substantial and sustained progress from the baseline \ntoward the Target Outcome.   \nFigure 13: Supervisor Workloads: Percent of Supervisors Meeting Workload Standards \n100.0%\n90.0% \n90.0% 85.3%  83.5%  84.6% \n81.3% \n79.8% \n80.0% 75.1% \n70.9% \n70.0%\n58.8% \n60.0%\n50.0%\n40.0%\n30.0%\n20.0%\n10.0%\n \n \n0.0%\n \nJul-14 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul-17 Jan-18 Target\n    \nSource: DHS Data \n \nDHS reported a slight, positive decline in the number of supervisors who are assigned and \nmanage their own cases.  Child welfare cases managed by supervisors carry the same case \nweight  as  the  cases  managed  by  caseworkers  and  are  calculated  into  each  supervisor’s \nworkload ratio.  As of December 31, 2017, 21 supervisors carried more than two cases, a slight \nworsening from the 15 supervisors who carried more than two cases on June 28, 2017.   \nFor this report period, the Co-Neutrals again find that DHS has made good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcome for meeting supervisor \nworkload standards.  \nD. Shelter Use \nDHS has made important strides toward its goal of eliminating shelter care for the youngest \nchildren in DHS custody.  For the third consecutive period, no child, ages one year or younger, \nexperienced  a  shelter  stay,  and  only  four  children  between  the  ages  of  two  and  five \nexperienced a shelter stay this report period.  Oklahoma has become rooted in a case practice \nthat ensures, except in the rarest of circumstances, that the youngest children in DHS’ custody \nare not placed in shelters. The Co-Neutrals find DHS made good faith efforts during this period \n50 \n \n\nto achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the shelter Target Outcomes for Metrics \n5.1 (children ages 0 to 1 years old) and 5.2 (children ages 2 to 5 years old).  \n \nDHS has not achieved this critical progress for children six years of age and older who continue \nto be placed too often in shelters across Oklahoma. For children in this age group, particularly \nthose with behavioral, developmental, and/or mental health issues, shelter care is sometimes, \nstill,  the  only  placement  option.  As  the  Co-Neutrals  have  highlighted  in  multiple  prior \nCommentaries, the significant lack of placement options for children with specialized needs has \nperpetuated DHS’ ongoing reliance on shelter care.    \n \nIn addition to the lack of placement options for children who experienced a shelter stay this \nperiod, DHS’ efforts to prevent shelter placements and to reduce the length of time children \nremain in shelters were not adequate during this period.  In particular, DHS’ principal practice \nto expedite children’s exit from shelters to needs-based placements lacked sufficient leadership \noversight and guidance to ensure the practice urgently and effectively identified and secured \nappropriate placements for children outside of a shelter. DHS leadership acknowledged that the \nintensity of its practice of reviewing every shelter placement request to ensure that all potential \nfamily-based placements had been exhausted before a child enters a shelter had waned. This is \nevident by DHS’ own findings on a sample review of shelter authorizations during the months of \nOctober and November 2017.   \n \nFor this period, DHS reported a nearly 30 percent increase in the number of shelter nights \nchildren  ages  six  to  twelve  experienced.  This  represents  the  third  consecutive  period  of \nincreased shelter nights for this age group. While the number of shelter nights children 13 and \nolder experienced declined modestly this period relative to last period, the number of shelter-\nnights older youth experienced this period far exceeded the Target Outcome DHS committed to \nof 8,850 nights by June 30, 2016. In addition, for those youth who did experience a shelter stay, \nan  increased  percentage  experienced  more than  30  shelter  nights  and/or  more  than one \nshelter stay when compared to the last report period. The Co-Neutrals do not find that DHS \nmade good faith efforts during this period to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward \nthe shelter Target Outcomes for Metrics 5.3 and 5.4, which measure the number of nights \nchildren ages six and older spent in shelters and Pinnacle Plan 1.17, which captures in greater \ndetail the number of older youth who experienced more than 30 nights in a shelter and/or \nmultiple shelter stays during the period. \n \nThe majority of children who experience shelter care in Oklahoma are placed at Youth Service \nAgency  (YSA)  shelters.  During  the  current  report  period,  maltreatment  at  these  shelters \nincreased.  During the last report period, a total of four children were maltreated in YSA \n51 \n \n\nshelters, as reflected in two substantiated referrals, while during this report period, 11 children \nwere maltreated in YSA shelters, as reflected in six substantiated referrals. The high incidence \nof maltreatment in shelters is concerning and demands DHS’ urgent attention to resolve.  It also \nunderscores the inherent challenges related to shelter care, which involves placing numerous \nchildren in one space together with diverse needs, ages, and sexes. Understanding the risks \nrelated to shelter care, it is incumbent upon DHS to effectively employ its resources, with a \nsense of urgency, to substantially and sustainably reduce the shelter population in Oklahoma.       \nPerformance Standards \n \nDHS committed that it would “ensure all children are cared for in family-like settings” and “stop \nits use of temporary placement in shelters for all children under 13 years of age.”  In the \nMetrics Plan, the Co-Neutrals selected the number of “child-nights” spent in shelters as the \nmeasure to assess Oklahoma’s progress in eliminating and reducing shelter use.  One “child-\nnight” is defined as “one child in a shelter at midnight.”  The total number of child-nights is \ncalculated by summing the number of children in shelters at midnight for each night of the \nreporting period.   The Pinnacle Plan includes an exception for shelter placement if the child is \npart of a sibling set of four or more being placed together. The Co-Neutrals have also allowed \nfor the exception to place a minor parent with their child if necessary to keep the parent and \nchild together (note that the child must, in fact, be placed with their minor parent).24   However, \nwhile the Co-Neutrals approved these exceptions, they are not automatic. For each child or \nyouth in need of placement, DHS has committed to undertake reasonable efforts to place the \nchild in a family-like setting, regardless of whether the child meets an exception.   \nPerformance for Children under Age Six, Shelter Metrics 5.1 and 5.2 \nFor the third consecutive period, DHS has achieved the Target Outcome of zero child-nights in \nshelters for children under two years of age.  DHS has successfully eliminated shelter care for \nthis youngest cohort of children from its baseline of 2,923 child-nights to zero for the third \nconsecutive report period.     \n                                                      \n24 Children who meet the criteria for one of the two exceptions are included in the shelter outcomes data.   \n52 \n \n\nFigure 14: Metrics 5.1 – Shelter-Nights, Children Ages 0 - 1\n3,500\n2,923 \n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n843 \n1,000\n624 \n505 \n500\n190  189 \n2  0  0  0 \n0  \nBaseline Jan - 14 Jul - 14 Jan - 15 Jul - 15 Jan - 16 Jul - 16 Jan - 17 Jul -17 Jan-18\nJan-June  \n2012     Source: DHS Data  \n \nFor children ages two to five, the original baseline recorded was 8,853 child-nights, and DHS’ \nmost recent data shows that while DHS did not meet the Target Outcome of zero-child nights \nfor this age group, DHS remains close to meeting this Target Outcome.  For this period, July 1, \n2017 to December 31, 2017, four children spent a combined total of 130 nights in a shelter.  In \ncomparison to the last report period, DHS’ data shows one fewer child experienced a shelter \nstay this period.

These shelter nights represent 163 unique children, \nwhich is 13 more children than DHS reported spent a night in a shelter last period.  As the \nFigure below presents, this is the third consecutive period the number of child-nights has \nincreased for this age group. In particular, children ages six to 12 experienced a concerning 92 \npercent increase in child-nights since July 2016 when DHS achieved a record low number of 112 \nchildren in this age group experiencing a shelter stay.     \nIt is important to highlight not only DHS’ commitment to achieve zero shelter nights for children \nunder the age of 13 but also to ensure that children under 13 years old are placed in family-like \nsettings, which includes avoiding placements for these children in group home settings or other \ntypes  of  institutional  care,  except  in  rare  circumstances  such  as  when  a  child  requires \nhospitalization. \n \n \n \n54 \n \n\nFigure 16: Metric 5.3 – Shelter-Nights, Children Ages 6 – 12 \n25,000\n23,127 \n22,288 \n20,147 \n20,000 18,631 \n15,000 13,867 \n10,188 \n10,000\n8,002 \n6,232 \n5,052 \n4,158 \n5,000\n \n0  \nBaseline Jan - 14 Jul - 14 Jan - 15 Jul - 15 Jan - 16 Jul - 16 Jan - 17  Jul-17 Jan-18\nJan-June  \n2012       Source: DHS Data \n \nShelter Metric 5.4 and Pinnacle Plan Commitment 1.17 – Youth 13 and Older \nNeither  DHS’  Pinnacle  Plan  nor  the  Compromise  and  Settlement  Agreement  require  that \nemergency shelter usage for children 13 years and older be completely eliminated.  However, \nDHS did commit under the Pinnacle Plan (Point 1.17) that by June 30, 2014, children ages 13 \nand older would be placed in a shelter only if a family-like placement is not available to meet \ntheir needs; and further, DHS would not place any child over age 13 in a shelter more than one \ntime and for no more than 30 days within a 12-month period.  \nFor this report period, the number of unique children ages 13 and older who spent a night in a \nshelter decreased from 366 children in the last period to 313 children this period.   DHS \nreported  14,000  child-nights  for  this  oldest  group  of  children,  which  represents  a  slight \ndecrease from last period when DHS reported 14,893 child-nights.  As shown in the Figure \nbelow, while DHS has reduced the number of child-nights for this period, the number of nights \nolder youth experienced in a shelter this period is still 34 percent greater than in July 2016 \nwhen DHS achieved the lowest number of shelter nights for this age-group. Further, DHS has \nnot substantially and sustainably reduced the number of shelter nights for this age-group in \norder to meet its commitment of 8,850 child-nights by June 30, 2016. \n \n \n55 \n \n\nFigure 17: Metric 5.4-Shelter Nights, Children Ages 13 and Older \n30,000\n25,342  24,935  25,108  24,552 \n25,000\n20,635 \n20,000 18,277 \n14,893 \n15,000 14,000 \n12,048 \n10,478 \n10,000 8,850 \n5,000\n \n \n \n0\n \nBaseline Jan-14 Jul-14 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul-17 Jan-18 Target\n        \n                 Source: DHS Data \n \nDHS committed that by June 30, 2016, 90 percent of all children ages 13 and older who \nexperience a shelter stay would be in compliance with Pinnacle Plan 1.17, which requires that \nthese older youth experience no more than one shelter stay and no more than 30 shelter-nights \nin any 12-month period.  For the period of July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, DHS reported \nthat 28.1 percent (88) of the 313 children ages 13 and older with an overnight shelter stay were \nplaced consistent with Pinnacle Plan 1.17, but 225 children were not. This represents a decline \nin  performance  from  last  period  when  DHS  reported  that  33.1  percent  of  children  were \ncompliant with Pinnacle Plan 1.17.

The primary two practices DHS has utilized to effectively reduce \nshelter care are: multidisciplinary staffings to expeditiously identify needs-based placements for \nchildren in shelters and a heightened review process by leadership to ensure for each child \nplaced in a shelter an exhaustive search is undertaken to identify a needs-based placement in \nlieu of shelter care.     \nTable 4: Child-Nights in Shelters by Age, January 2017 to December 2017 \nBaseline  Performance \nChild-Nights in \n(Jan 2012- (July 2017- December  Change (N)  Change (%) \nShelters by Age \nJune 2013)  2017) \n0 to 1  2,923  0  -2,923  -100.0% \n2 to 5  8,853  130  -8,723  -98.5% \n6 to 12  20,147  8,002  -12,145  -60.3% \n13 & Older  20,635  14,000  -6,635  -32.2% \nTOTAL  52,558  22,132  -30,426  -58% \n \n57 \n \n\nThe progress DHS has made toward reducing shelter usage during this reform most markedly \nmaterialized during the period of January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 when DHS successfully \nreduced the total number of children using shelter care to 382 children down from 1,212 \nchildren eighteen months prior. Since June 30, 2016, DHS has not made or sustained further \nreductions in shelter usage for children six years of age and older, as the chart below illustrates. \nFigure 19: Number of Unique Children Six Years and Older, July 2016 to January 2018 \n600\n516 \n476 \n500\n453 \n376 \n400\n300\n200\n100\n \n \n0  \nJul - 16 Jan - 17 Jul-17   Jan-18\n  Source: DHS Data \n \nAs discussed above, the greatest challenge to DHS’ ability to meet its commitment to eliminate \nshelter care for children 12 years of age and younger and significantly reduce shelter care for \nyouth 13 years of age and older is the extreme lack of available needs-based placements for \nchildren  with  increased  behavioral,  mental  or  developmental  needs.  Until  DHS  effectively \ndevelops and retains an adequate placement continuum that is able to serve the diverse needs \nof children in DHS custody, DHS will continue to struggle to reduce shelter care in Oklahoma as \nenvisioned by the CSA.   \nSince this placement continuum does not yet exist, DHS developed the two primary practices \ndescribed  above  to  ensure  that  children  are  only  placed  in  shelters  if  there  is  no  other \nplacement available and, if placed, that efforts begin immediately to identify and secure a \nplacement outside a shelter, preferably in a family-based placement, if appropriate.  However, \nduring this period, DHS’ implementation of these practices lacked the necessary level of focus \nand  rigor  to  ensure  DHS  was  effectively  preventing  unnecessary  shelter  placements  and \nreducing the length of time children were placed in shelters.    \n \n58 \n \n\nPreventing Shelter Placements  \n \nIn  February  2014,  DHS  heightened  oversight  and  accountability  of  shelter  placements  by \nrequiring that for children less than 13 years of age all shelter authorizations must be approved \nby the CWS Director and for children 13 years of age or older, shelter authorization must be \napproved by the regional deputy director.  In order to approve a child’s placement in a shelter, \nthe CWS Director or a regional deputy director, as appropriate, is responsible for ensuring all \nnecessary efforts to identify and secure a needs-based placement for a child were completed \nand documented on a pre-authorization form prior to shelter admission.   \n \nDuring this report period, DHS leadership acknowledged that the department had reduced its \nfocus and attention on the shelter authorization process and this was evident, according to \nDHS,  by  a  decline  in  the  diligent  efforts  to  prevent  shelter  placement  documented  by \ncaseworkers on pre-authorization forms.  DHS’ March 2018 analysis of the shelter authorization \nprocess identified similar concerns.  The analysis, which focused on a review of 184 children \nwho were placed in shelter care at Laura Dester and YSA shelters during the months of October \nand November 2017, found that some pre-authorization forms presented sufficient efforts to \nprevent a shelter placement, while other authorization forms were approved despite a lack of \ninformation to demonstrate thorough efforts to divert the shelter placement. \n \nIn its analysis, DHS acknowledged that over time leadership had become aware that the pre-\nauthorization form “did not lend itself to prompting the necessary guidance to ensure all \nappropriate levels of care are assessed prior to a shelter placement request.”   It is not clear \nwhen DHS learned that the form insufficiently guided caseworkers on the actions they must \ntake to identify a needs-based placement for a child to prevent shelter care.  However, in \nMarch 2018, following the close of this period, DHS revised its pre-authorization form to \naddress these identified concerns.  In addition, the revised form includes new prompts about \nthe child’s functioning, placement history, and specific needs in order to best facilitate securing \na needs-based placement for a child.  The analysis also recommended that the department \nenhance  accountability  at  the  regional  deputy  director  level  to  ensure  that  DHS  is  only \nadmitting children to shelters after all appropriate efforts are attempted to identity a family or \nalternate needs-based placement. The Co-Neutrals strongly encourage DHS to follow through \non this recommendation immediately. DHS must establish consistent accountability to ensure \nthat children are only placed in shelters after it has been conclusively determined that there is \nno other safe, needs-based placement option for a child.  \n \n \n \n59 \n \n\nReducing Shelter Stays \n \nIn  2015,  DHS  implemented  multi-disciplinary  staffings  as  its  primary  strategy  to  fulfill  its \ncommitment to close the two state-operated shelters, Pauline E. Mayer and Laura Dester.  \nThrough  these  staffings  and  other  efforts,  DHS  successfully  closed  Pauline  E.  Mayer,  and \nsignificantly reduced the population of children at Laura Dester to nine in 2016.  In February \n2016, DHS expanded the staffing model to include children placed at the YSA shelters. The \nstaffings were led by a shelter lead, “…whose sole responsibility is to eliminate shelter usage for \nchildren under the age of 12 by SFY16 and to significantly reduce shelter care for children 13 \nand over by reserving use only for circumstances in which a family-like setting cannot be \nobtained,” and included a team of multidisciplinary specialists from within and outside of DHS, \nincluding from foster care, TFC, legal services and developmental disabilities, among others. \n \nIn the latter half of 2016, following DHS’ significant reduction in statewide shelter usage, DHS \nmade the decision to re-structure multi-disciplinary staffings.  DHS reported that due to the \ndecrease  in  shelter  utilization  and  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  staffings,  it  was \nappropriate  to  transition  the  centralized,  statewide  staffings  to  regional  staffings.    DHS \nreported each region was assigned a specific person to lead staffing efforts and this individual \nwas provided a staffing tool to facilitate staffings and was offered ongoing consultation from \nthe state office shelter staffing team.   \n \nFollowing the shift to the regional model, DHS reported that the transition to the new model \nhad impacted the effectiveness of the staffings.  As with any new practice, the new regional \nteams needed to build expertise and establish protocols to guide their staffing efforts.  In April \n2017, in response to DHS’ acknowledgement that the new staffing model was not yet producing \nthe  intended  outcomes,  the  Co-Neutrals  reported  that  they  would  review,  during  the \nsubsequent period (January 2017-June 2017), DHS’ efforts to transfer to the regional offices the \nskill set and accountability to effectively and expeditiously move children out of shelters and \ninto needs-based placements. \n \nIn response, last period DHS designated a full-time program field representative (PFR) position \nto lead DHS’ multidisciplinary staffing efforts after the previous statewide shelter lead was \nassigned  expanded  responsibilities  in  another  significant  area  of  DHS’  reform  effort.    In \nparticular, the new lead for multidisciplinary staffings was to provide expertise and support to \nregional leads to strengthen the capacity of the regions to effectively conduct these staffings.   \nUnfortunately, due to the pronounced challenges of securing placements for children placed at \nLaura Dester, the majority of the lead’s efforts during the current period were focused on Laura \nDester, resulting in a lack of support and guidance to the regions. This is particularly concerning \n60 \n \n\nbecause most children in shelter care are not placed at Laura Dester, but at YSA shelters across \nthe state. For these children, the regional staffings are the primary mechanism by which these \nchildren are staffed to find placements outside of the shelters. \n \nDuring the current period, through discussions with DHS, it was apparent to the Co-Neutrals \nthat regional and shelter leads needed greater support to improve the quality and outcomes of \nregional staffings to move children out of YSA shelters more quickly.  Specifically, DHS had not \ndeveloped a systemic approach among the five regions to establish clear expectations of, and \naccountability  for,  staffings  and  their  outcomes.   After  this  discussion,  DHS  committed  to \ndevelop tools and guidance for the regional shelter leads to ensure that regions develop the \nknowledge and skills necessary to conduct staffings effectively.   Following the close of this \nreporting period, DHS developed a uniform Progressive Shelter Staffing Form and Action Plan to \nbe utilized by each regional lead during each child’s shelter staffing with an expected start date \nof March 1, 2018.  In addition, DHS developed an Enhanced Shelter Reduction Plan which \nconsists of uniform shelter staffing protocols to be implemented statewide during next period.  \nWithin this report period, DHS did not establish the necessary protocols to ensure regional \nstaffings were performed effectively to more expeditiously exit children from shelters.   \n \nNeeds-based Placements for Children in Shelters \n \nDuring this report period, a total of 480 children experienced shelter care.  For these children, \nDHS was unable to identify and secure a needs-based placement, which resulted in shelter \nplacement.  As the Table below shows, the majority of children who experienced shelter care \nthis period were placed at YSA shelters across Oklahoma.  The population of children served in \nYSA shelters often present with increased emotional and/or behavioral needs and the great \nmajority of children (88 percent) placed at YSA shelters are teenagers, for whom DHS has faced \nsignificant challenges to identify foster homes willing to accept their placement.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n61 \n \n\nTable 5: Unique Children by Shelter, July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 \nTotal  Shelter  % Youth \n% Laura \nAge Group  Unique  Youth Services  Services \nLaura Dester  Dester  \nChildren  Shelters  Shelters  \nAge 0-1  0  0  0  0%  0% \nAge 2-5  4  4  1  100%  25% \nAge 6-12  163  106  68  65%  42% \nAge 13+  313  275  76  88%  24% \nTotal \n480  385  145  80%  30% \nChildren \nNote:  Children who stayed in more than one shelter category were counted for each category.  \nBecause of this, not all percentages add up to 100. \n \nCentral to DHS’ efforts to reduce shelter care must be a concerted focus to develop and expand \nits placement continuum to meet the needs of children who are placed in shelters, including \ntraditional and TFC foster homes, as well as higher-level, specialized placements. DHS’ March \n2018 Shelter Authorization Analysis, referenced earlier in this section, collected data on some \nof the primary characteristics of children who are typically placed in shelters to inform DHS’ \nefforts to build an adequate continuum of care.  The findings of this analysis clearly show that \nthe  population  of  children  served  in  shelters  has  significant  needs,  as  evidenced  by \ndevelopmental disabilities, aggressive/violent behavior, mental health diagnoses, placement \ndisruptions and prior  inpatient stays. The analysis also highlights the significant dearth of \nplacement options for this population of children.  Of the 184 children in the review sample, 24 \npercent (44 children) of the children’s placements prior to the reviewed shelter placement \nwere in another shelter. This represented the largest prior placement of the sample.   The \nreview also looked at children’s placement following the reviewed shelter placement.  Nine \npercent of children (17) moved from the reviewed shelter placement to another shelter. This \nmeans that over a quarter (61 out of 184 children) experienced two consecutive shelter stays.25 \n \nAfter the close of this report period, DHS reported to the Co-Neutrals some of its efforts to \nexpand its placement continuum as part of it plan to close the Laura Dester shelter. These \nefforts included the development of four new level E group homes to serve a maximum of 60 \nchildren.  In addition, DHS has issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 16-24 bed Intermediate \n                                                      \n25 Of the 61 children who experienced shelter to shelter placements, DHS’ analysis did not identify if any of these \nchildren are duplicates, in that they experienced a shelter placement before and after the shelter placement under \nreview.  \n62 \n \n\nCare Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID).  DHS plans to re-purpose Laura \nDester and allow the provider selected through this RFP to serve children who are dually \ndiagnosed with developmental and emotional challenges. As noted in the foster care section, \nDHS also is partnering with Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS) to expand family-based \nplacements for children with developmental disabilities.   \n \nIn the next Commentary, the Co-Neutrals will assess DHS’ ongoing efforts and activities to \nstrengthen its practices to prevent unnecessary shelter placements and to reduce the length of \ntime children spend in shelters.  The Co-Neutrals will also closely monitor DHS’ efforts to \nsubstantially and sustainably reduce the number of children six years of age and older who use \nshelter care.  Lastly, the Co-Neutrals strongly advise that DHS take all steps necessary to ensure \nthe safety of children placed in shelters. \nE.  Child Maltreatment in Care \nChildren in DHS custody continue to experience abuse and neglect at an alarmingly high rate in \nboth foster homes and institutional settings.  During this report period, which covers the data \nreporting period of October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, DHS did not reduce the number of \nchildren in DHS custody who were abused and neglected when compared to the last report \nperiod. The agency’s wanting efforts during and following the period, as discussed in this \nsection, do not bode well for substantial and sustained gains in child safety in the near term.  \nThe department’s inadequate efforts, contributing to the high incidence of child maltreatment, \nraise serious concerns for child safety.   \n \nIn  August  2015,  DHS  developed  and  began  implementation  of  a  set  of  core  strategies  it \ndesigned to reduce the prevalence of abuse and neglect among children in DHS custody.  DHS \ndevised  these  strategies  to  address  recurrent  concerns  surfaced  in  the  Co-Neutrals’  first \nmaltreatment in care (MIC) case record review, which included a comprehensive analysis of all \ninvestigations substantiated for child maltreatment in foster homes and institutional settings \nfor the period of October 1, 2013 to September 31, 2014. For this Commentary, the Co-Neutrals \nfocused their record review on all substantiated child maltreatment investigations that closed \nbetween July and December 2017 involving children placed in foster homes and institutional \nsettings.26  The review identified a prevalence of the very same areas of concern surfaced in the \nCo-Neutrals’ first case record review.   \n                                                      \n26 Through previous Commentaries, the Co-Neutrals have discussed their findings from four MIC case record \nreviews covering substantiated cases in foster homes and institutional settings from October 2013 through June \n2017. \n63 \n \n\n \nWith respect to child maltreatment in foster homes, the Co-Neutrals have determined that \nduring the current report period DHS did not make good faith efforts to achieve substantial and \nsustained progress in preventing child maltreatment. In particular, based on discussions with \nDHS leadership, document reviews and field observations, the Co-Neutrals assess that DHS did \nnot transfer in a timely and thoughtful manner many of the findings from its ongoing, monthly \nreviews  of  maltreatment  substantiations  to  caseworker  practice,  training,  support  and \nguidance. The Co-Neutrals observed that while caseworkers consistently performed the case \npractices contained in the MIC core strategies, critical deficiencies recurred in the execution \nand  quality  of  these  practices,  substantially  weakening  DHS’  efforts  to  prevent  the \nmaltreatment of children in the state’s custody. The Co-Neutrals’ and DHS’ MIC case reviews \nrepeatedly,  across  more  than  two  years,  identified that  warning  signs  of  child  abuse  and \nneglect, or risks of the same, are often reported and visible to the agency well before DHS \nconfirms a child is a victim of maltreatment. In too many instances, the agency’s efforts did not \ninclude prompt, appropriate action when these signs were first identified and documented by \nDHS.  Those lapses and a lack of appropriate, effective ongoing guidance from DHS leadership \nto  caseworkers  and  supervisors  implementing  the  MIC  core  strategies  led  to  a  less  than \neffective statewide implementation of the core strategies and continued to expose children to \nan unreasonable risk of harm in foster homes.   \n \nIn the area of institutional settings, DHS’ pledge to heighten its monitoring and oversight of \nfacilities with identified safety concerns did not result consistently in timely and sustainable \nresolution of identified safety concerns.  Of the eight group homes and shelters subject to \nheightened  monitoring  during  the  current  period,  four  facilities  received  more  than  one \nmaltreatment substantiation following the initiation of heightened monitoring.  For this report \nperiod, three group homes each had at least four substantiations after DHS initiated intensified \noversight of the facility, which resulted in the maltreatment of 23 children. In the six months \nfollowing the close of the current period (October 2017 to March 2018), five additional children \nwere  maltreated  at  two  of  these  three  group  homes.  The  repeated  incidence  of  child \nmaltreatment at facilities subject to DHS’ heightened oversight raises questions about DHS’ \nability to address and resolve persistent safety risks at some of these facilities.  This was \nparticularly evident at the state-operated Laura Dester shelter, where serious safety concerns \nlong went unresolved and contributed to the abuse or neglect of four children during the \ncurrent period, and thirteen children during the next period.27   \n \n                                                      \n27 Three children are included in both report periods, as the report periods overlap.  The total number of unique \nchildren maltreated during the combined two report periods (October 2016 to March 2018) is 14.  \n64 \n \n\nAchieving a substantial and sustained reduction in the rate of maltreatment of children in the \nstate’s custody is the department’s most imperative work. For this reporting period, DHS’ \nperformance declined on both of the two metrics (1.1: MIC by a resource caregiver and 1.2: \nMIC by a parent) established to measure child safety. DHS did not make substantial and \nsustained progress toward the Target Outcomes in the current period and preliminary data for \nthe next report period, April 2017 to March 2018, indicates that DHS’ performance does not \nappear to show improvement in child safety under Measure 1.1 (MIC by a resource caregiver).  \nFor the reasons discussed in this section, the Co-Neutrals do not find that DHS made good faith \nefforts during this period to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the MIC Target \nOutcomes. \n \nChild Safety: Abuse and Neglect by Resource Caregivers While Child is in the Legal Custody of \nDHS, Metric 1a \nDHS tracks and reports publicly on a monthly basis the number of children abused or neglected \nby a resource caregiver.  DHS and the Co-Neutrals adopted the federal metric applicable at the \ntime, “Absence of Child Abuse and/or Neglect in Foster Care,” which reports the percent of all \nchildren  in  foster  care  during  a  12-month  period  who  were  not  victims  of  substantiated \nmaltreatment by a foster parent or facility staff. 28   \nFor this metric’s current report period, October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, DHS reported \nthat 184 children out of 15,113 in DHS custody were abused or neglected while in care.  This \nrepresents a rate of 98.78 percent of children in DHS custody during the period who were not \nvictims of child maltreatment.  For DHS to have met the Target Outcome of 99.68 percent of \nchildren safe in custody, DHS would have had to keep an additional 136 children safe from \nabuse and neglect by a resource caregiver.  \nAs shown in the Figure below, during the baseline period, April 2013 to March 2014, DHS \nreported that 98.73 percent of children in DHS custody were not victims of child maltreatment \nand reported the same outcome of 98.73 percent during the following report period from \nOctober 2013 to September 2014. Over the six subsequent reporting periods (including the \ncurrent period), DHS’ safety outcomes have not substantially or sustainably progressed toward \nthe Target Outcome.   \n \n                                                      \n28 In October 2014, the federal Children’s Bureau changed the metric it uses to assess state child safety in care.  \nThe new federal metric combines maltreatment in care by resource caregivers and by parents, with some \nadditional adjustments to the methodology.  For consistency and comparability, the Co-Neutrals and DHS continue \nto use the two metrics and methodology originally established in the Metrics Plan.  \n65 \n \n\nFigure 20: Metric 1a – Absence of Maltreatment in Care by Resource Caregivers \n99.8% 99.68% \n99.6%\n99.4%\n99.2%\n99.0%\n98.84% \n98.78% \n98.73%  98.73%  98.73% \n98.8%\n98.62%  98.64% \n98.6%\n98.42% \n98.4%\n98.2%\n98.0%\n97.8%  \n \n97.6%\n \nBaseline Oct 13 - April 14 - Oct 14 - April 15 - Oct 15 - April 16 - Oct 16 - Target\n \n(April 13 Sept 14 March 15 Sept 15 March 16 Sept 16 March 17 Sept 17\n \n- March\n     Source: DHS Data \n14)\n \nIn  addition  to  reporting  performance  on  this  metric  semi-annually,  DHS  publicly  reports \nsubstantiations of child maltreatment monthly.  Over the same 12-month period, October 1, \n2016 to September 30, 2017, DHS reported 208 substantiations of child abuse and neglect by a \nresource  caregiver.   Of these,  24  substantiations  are  not  included  in  the  federal  measure \nadopted  by  the  Co-Neutrals  as  Metric  1a  for  two  reasons: (1)  16  child  abuse  or  neglect \nsubstantiations were excluded because, according to the federal methodology in place at the \ntime the Metrics Plan was finalized, both the referral date (date when an allegation is made to \nDHS) and findings date (date when the case is substantiated by DHS) must exist in the same 12 \nmonth federal reporting period; and (2) eight child abuse or neglect substantiations were not \ncounted in the federal metric because they represent multiple substantiations for the same \nchild. The adopted federal measure only accounts for one substantiation per child within the \nsame period. Of the 208 substantiations of maltreatment reported in the monthly data, 148 \nsubstantiations (71 percent) are for children in family-based foster care settings, while 60 \nsubstantiations (29 percent) are for children in residential facilities or higher-level institutions. \nChild Safety: Abuse and Neglect by Parents While Child is in the Legal Custody of DHS, Metric 1b \nThe Co-Neutrals adapted the methodology utilized in the preceding section, Abuse and Neglect \nby Resource Caregivers, to measure abuse and neglect by parents while a child is in the legal \n66 \n \n\ncustody of DHS. This includes the significant population of children who remain the legal \nresponsibility of DHS but who reside in, or have been placed back in, their homes of origin for \ntrial home visits.  In Oklahoma, children can experience trial home visits for months, and DHS \nrecognizes the importance of closely monitoring their safety. \nThis metric for “Abuse and Neglect by Parents While Child is in the Legal Custody of DHS,” \nmeasures performance this way:  Of all children in the legal custody of DHS during the reporting \nperiod, the number and percent of children who were not victims of substantiated or indicated \nmaltreatment by a parent and the number of children who were victims over the 12-month \nperiod.  \nFor this report period, October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, DHS served 15,113 children in \ncustody, 202 of whom were abused or neglected by parents while in DHS custody, yielding a \nsafety rate of 98.66 percent against a target of 99 percent. For DHS to have reached the Target \nOutcome  during  this  period,  the  agency  would  have  had  to  prevent  maltreatment  to  an \nadditional 51 children.  As the Figure below shows, DHS’ performance on this metric has \ndeclined over 18 months of monitoring. \nFigure 21: Metric 1b – Absence of Maltreatment in Care by Parents \n99.1%\n99.00% \n99.0%\n98.9% 98.85% 98.84% \n98.79% \n98.8%\n98.7% 98.66% \n98.6% 98.56%  98.57%  98.58% \n98.50% \n98.5% 98.44% \n98.37% \n98.4%\n98.3%\n98.2%\n98.1%\n \n \n98.0%\n \nBaseline Oct 12 - April 13 - Oct 13 - April 14 - Oct 14 - April 15 - Oct 15 - April 16 - Oct 16 - Target\nOct 11 - Sept 13 Mar 14 Sept 14 Mar 15 Sept 15 March 16 Sept 16 March  17 Sept 17\nSept 12  \n      Source: DHS Data \n \n67 \n \n\nDHS’ data showed an additional 56 substantiations of maltreatment of children by their parents \nwhile  in  DHS  custody  that  were  excluded  in  the  measure  because  of  the  same  federal \nexceptions applicable in Metric 1a:  49 are excluded because the referral date (date when an \nallegation is made to DHS) and findings date (date when the case is substantiated) do not exist \nin the same 12-month reporting period or due to multiple substantiations on the same child; \nand, seven are excluded for other applicable criteria.29   During this period, DHS continued to \nlose ground on this metric and must take urgent and appropriate actions to reverse the decline \nin performance in this vital area.  \nComparative MIC Rates by Placement Types \nThe Co-Neutrals reviewed whether children are maltreated by a resource caregiver more often \nin certain placement types through an analysis of MIC rates for each placement type (see Table \n6 below). The Co-Neutrals used the method that the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services Children’s Bureau adopted to measure how often MIC occurs, which calculates \na rate of maltreatment based on the days children are in child welfare custody. The rate \nsignifies, for every 100,000 days that a group of children spent in custody, the number of MIC \nsubstantiations those children experienced. In the Co-Neutrals’ analysis, lower MIC rates mean \nthat children experienced less maltreatment by resource caregivers in that placement type, \nwhile higher rates mean children experienced more maltreatment by resource caregivers while \nresiding in that placement type. \nTable 6: Rate of MIC by Placement Type, Current and Prior Report Periods \nCurrent Period  Last Period \n(Oct ’16 – Sept ’17)  (April ’16 – March ’17) \nPlacement Type \n# of Children  # of Children \nMIC Rate   MIC Rate  \nMaltreated  Maltreated \nRegular Foster Family Care  33  5.38  31  4.96 \nFoster Family Care - Supported Home  19  3.36  23  4.11 \nKinship Foster Family Care Relative  73  6.48  82  6.72 \nKinship Foster Family Care Non-Relative  14  4.76  15  4.97 \nTherapeutic Foster Family Care  7  5.08  9  5.34 \nCongregate Care  60  27.15  44  19.33 \nOther Foster Family Care  2  1.1  4  2.19 \nTotal  208  6.57  208  6.28 \n                                                      \n29 The exclusion criteria for these seven children are: three children experienced two removals during the period, \nand maltreatment occurred during the second removal, which according to federal rules does not then count; and \nfour children’s first placements following removal (i.e., hospital) is not counted according to federal rules.   \n68 \n \n\nThe Table above shows that children in congregate care had the highest rate of maltreatment \nby a resource caregiver of any placement type, a rate five times higher than children placed in \nfamily-based  care.    Furthermore,  the  rate  of  maltreatment  in  congregate  care  settings \nsubstantially increased from last period.  \nFollowing congregate care, kinship-relative care had the second highest MIC rate30 and the \ngreatest number of child victims of any placement type.  Children placed in regular foster \nhomes experienced the third highest MIC rate during this period.  As the Table above shows, \nthe rate of maltreatment increased in regular foster homes this period when compared to last \nperiod.  Overall, the rate of maltreatment for all children in DHS custody increased when \ncompared to the previous 12-month report period.   \nCore Strategies to Reduce MIC in Family-Based Placements \nIn August 2015, DHS began implementing a set of core strategies to improve child safety.  DHS \nreported the strategies were intended to address the most predominant concerns identified in \nthe Co-Neutrals’ first case record review of all MIC substantiations in foster homes between \nOctober 2013 and September 2014. The three primary concerns were:  \n1.  Referral Histories: foster homes with extensive referral histories that contain screened \nout,  ruled  out,  or  unsubstantiated  referrals  for  the  same  or  similar  abuse/neglect \nallegations that were eventually substantiated or that revealed patterns of concerning \nconditions in foster homes; \n \n2.  Quality of Visits: some caseworkers not thoroughly assessing and/or addressing child \nsafety and caregiver discipline during monthly visits; and, \n   \n3.  Home  approval:  foster  homes  with  concerning  child  welfare,  criminal  or  personal \nhistories that raise questions about the safety of certain new foster homes. \nAs detailed in previous Commentaries, to assess DHS’ efforts to address these specific safety \nconcerns, the Co-Neutrals, along with DHS, have continued to review the case records for every \nsubstantiated MIC allegation, as well as a sample of investigations that did not result in a \nsubstantiation. These ongoing reviews of maltreatment investigations continue to surface, even \nyears later, the same primary issues of concern originally noted above.  In fact, the review of 73 \n                                                      \n30 For the second consecutive report period, the rate of maltreatment in kinship homes has decreased, along with \nthe number of substantiations in this placement type.  However, the number of child maltreatment substantiations \nin kinship homes for this period has not reduced sufficiently to have a substantial, positive impact on DHS’ \nperformance toward the MIC Target Outcome.  \n69 \n \n\nsubstantiations in foster homes (40 unique substantiated foster homes) from July to December \n2017,  again  showed  recurrent  concerns  in  the  areas  of  referral  histories,  the  quality  of \ncaseworker visits, and foster homes approved despite concerning child welfare, criminal or \npersonal histories.  \nDHS committed to join the Co-Neutrals in conducting these MIC case reviews to assess the \nimpact that implementation of the core strategies was having on child safety. The Co-Neutrals \nhave found that DHS’ reviews of substantiated and unsubstantiated maltreatment referrals in \nfoster homes are thorough and effectively identify case specific and larger case practice areas \nof concern.  When safety concerns for children emerge from these reviews, the department \ncommitted to engage DHS leadership, supervisors, and caseworkers to promptly intervene and \naddress any child-specific safety concerns, as appropriate, as well as broader case practice \nconcerns that require attention and a plan of action in the field. Through this work, DHS has \ndeveloped a robust understanding of the primary risks, system-wide, that require remediation \nand mitigation to reduce child maltreatment in foster homes.  Unfortunately, DHS did not make \ngood faith efforts to transfer much of its qualitative learning from the Central Office review \nteam to frontline workers and supervisors across the enterprise. As a result, new protocols and \npractices, designed to improve child safety, often were not executed effectively across the state \ndue to inadequate guidance and support to the field, and failed to reflect sufficiently DHS’ \nawareness of ongoing deficiencies in case practice required to keep children safe. \nSafety-Focused Case Practice to Reduce Maltreatment in Foster Homes \nIncluded in the following sections are discussions of each of the primary safety concerns that \nhave consistently surfaced in the Co-Neutrals’ and DHS’ reviews of child maltreatment in foster \nhomes and the efforts DHS has undertaken during the current period.   \nReducing the Incidence of Foster Homes with Concerning Referral Histories \nIn  their  respective  case  record  reviews  of  foster  homes  where  maltreatment  has  been \nsubstantiated, the Co-Neutrals and DHS have consistently identified the existence of extensive \nreferral  histories  that  contain  previously  screened  out,  ruled  out,  or  unsubstantiated \nallegations. These referral histories often present a pre-existing, documented pattern of safety \nrisks to the child and overlooked concerns in the home.  To address this, DHS reported it began \nin February 2016 to require new and heightened multi-staff joint reviews of maltreatment \nreferrals received on children in foster homes, regardless of DHS’ decision to accept a referral \nfor investigation. Participants in these joint reviews include the  assigned permanency and \nresource family workers and their supervisors.  \n  \n70 \n \n\nA  separate  joint  review  follows  referrals  accepted  for  investigation,  known  as  a  “10-day \nstaffing.”  The 10-day staffing is a long-standing DHS practice in which staff are required to \ndetermine early within an investigation (within 10-days) whether the child should be removed \nfrom the home immediately and whether the home should be closed before the investigation \nconcludes.  DHS now requires that during these 10-day staffing sessions, caseworkers review \nthe  relevant  foster  home’s  referral  history  in  its  entirety  (including  all  screened-out, \nunsubstantiated and substantiated referrals) to identify any trends and/or concerns that may \nimpact a child’s safety. At the conclusion of a 10-day staffing, the caseworkers and supervisors \nare required to determine what appropriate actions are necessary to mitigate any safety risks in \nthe event a decision is made not to remove the child or close the home.  \nThe  joint  review  that  follows  DHS’  decision  not  to  accept  a  maltreatment  allegation  for \ninvestigation is called a screen-out consultation, during which DHS requires an assessment of \nthe foster home’s referral history and any other information that may reveal safety concerns \nand require follow up action by the department.    \nAs also reported in the last Commentary, the Co-Neutrals observed in their most recent case \nrecord  review  that  caseworkers  consistently  engaged  in  these  post-referral  reviews.    DHS \nreported that its tracking data for the months of October through December 2017 showed that \nall required 10-day staffings were completed for all investigated referrals.  In their record \nreview, the Co-Neutrals confirmed this and found that for all substantiated referrals closed \nbetween July and December 2017, workers conducted the 10-day staffing and higher-level \nmanagement  approved  the  outcome  of  each  staffing.    For  screen-out  consultations,  DHS \nreported that 89 percent were completed during the period of October through December \n2017.   \nDespite implementation of these post-referral staffings, the quality and depth of these reviews \nremains a serious concern.  In the most recent MIC case review, the Co-Neutrals identified that \nnearly  half  (48  percent  or  19  out  of  40)  of  the  foster  homes  substantiated  for  child \nmaltreatment had prior child maltreatment referrals (both investigated and screened-out) that \nappeared to signal safety concerns for the children placed in these homes.  For those foster \nhomes with referral histories, DHS’ joint reviews showed lapses in thoroughness with respect to \nassessing safety concerns.31  In some cases, the joint reviews did not effectively identify and/or \naddress safety concerns which had surfaced in referrals prior to the substantiated referral.  For \nexample, based upon the referral histories of some homes, the review identified that it may \nhave been appropriate for DHS to: remove a child from the foster home due to ongoing, safety \n                                                      \n31 Some homes’ prior referrals were not subject to the enhanced post-referral staffings due to these referrals \nhaving been received prior to the implementation of the new staffing protocols. \n71 \n \n\nconcerns; initiate a Written Plan of Compliance (WPC) to address and resolve identified safety \nconcerns in the home; and/or, increase contacts, monitoring or services in a home to ensure \nchild safety.  However, in some cases, DHS did not take these actions and children remained in \nunsafe foster homes until the subsequent abuse or neglect was inflicted, reported, investigated \nand substantiated.    \nFor example, in October 2017, a foster home was substantiated for the sexual abuse of two \nfoster children who were formerly placed in the home.  One year prior to this substantiation, in \nMarch 2016, a referral was called in on this foster home following the child’s first disclosure of \nsexual abuse by the foster father to her counselor.  During this referral’s investigation, the child \nagain disclosed sexual abuse by the foster father; however, because the child and her sister \n“each reported different events regarding the same time frames” DHS closed the investigation \nas unsubstantiated.  Following the closure of the investigation, both foster children remained \nplaced in the foster home.  DHS documented that the children were “safe” in the home as a \nsafety plan had been established that the foster father “will not be left alone with either of the \nchildren.”  DHS reported that the foster mother and her adult daughter were responsible for \nensuring this safety plan was enforced. However, the current, substantiated investigation found \nthat “there is evidence to suggest [that the foster mother and her adult daughter] failed to \nprotect [the foster children] and continued to allow [the foster father] to have contact with \nthem.”  Until this home’s closure in October 2017, DHS placed a total of ten additional children \nin this home, despite the department’s determination that foster children were unsafe in the \ncare of the foster father in the home. \nBy way of another example, in October 2017, DHS substantiated a foster home for the sexual \nabuse of two siblings.   This foster home’s referral history included two prior investigated \nreferrals from 2014 and 2015 which contained allegations of sexual abuse against the foster \nfather by several foster children placed in the home at that time.  In reference to the home’s \nreferral history, DHS stated, “While acting as a foster home, allegations of sexual abuse by [the \nfoster father] were investigated in 2014 and 2015.  Children in the home disclosed [that the \nfoster father] had become extremely intoxicated and touched them inappropriately.  Three \nseparate  foster  children  disclosed  fondling  and  grooming  type  behaviors  by  [the  foster \nfather].”  Despite these disclosures, both referrals were unsubstantiated at the time and the \nhome continued to care for foster children.32 In its internal review of the substantiated October \n2017 case, DHS wrote, “The Department continued to place children in the home for two more \nyears while having this information [referral history that contained child disclosures of sexual \nabuse] available to review.”  The sibling pair referenced above was placed in the foster home in \n                                                      \n32 Reviews by DHS in 2017 found there was sufficient evidence at the time of these investigations to meet the \nagency’s substantiation policy. \n72 \n \n\nMay 2016, nearly two years after the initial child disclosures of abuse in the home.   While only \nplaced in the foster home for one month, both siblings were sexually abused by the foster \nfather.   \nIn foster homes substantiated for physical abuse, the case record review identified missed \nopportunities  to  identify  and  address  prior  referrals  that  contained  similar  allegations  of \nphysical abuse in the foster home.  Specifically, the case review identified that nearly half of the \nfoster  homes  substantiated  for  physical  abuse  had  prior  referrals  (both  investigated  and \nscreened-out), which included allegations of physical abuse. Even when there were repeated \ndisclosures by children of inappropriate discipline in the home, the follow up joint reviews of \nthese prior referrals indicate that DHS either took no action to address referral allegations or \ntook insufficient action(s) that did not effectively eliminate the use of inappropriate discipline in \nthe home.   \nIn July 2017, for example, a foster home was substantiated for the physical abuse of a six year \nold boy.  This home had two prior investigated referrals, which contained disclosures by the boy \nthat he was subject to inappropriate discipline in the home.  In the first of the two referrals \n(January 2016), the investigation documented that the child reported that “he was hit with a \nflyswatter.”   In  the  second  referral  (September  2016),  the  child  disclosed  to  his  daycare \nprovider that his “[foster mother] hit him with a belt.”  During this investigation, the child \ndisclosed that “when he gets into trouble at home, he is hit with a belt while his clothes are \non.”  The 10-day staffings following each of these investigations did not result in caseworkers \ntaking  any  actions  to  address  the  foster  home’s  use  of  inappropriate  discipline.   Further, \nfollowing these investigations, during monthly contacts, the caseworkers in the home did not \ndiscuss with the foster parent the discipline methods used in the home. The third substantiated \nreferral was called into the DHS Abuse and Neglect Hotline in June 2017 when the boy was \nobserved to have scratch marks on his face that he reported during the investigation were \ncaused by the foster mother, who “had whooped him with a wood backscratcher.”  The boy’s \nyounger sister, four years old, disclosed during the investigation that she had “gotten whopped \nwith  a  belt”  in  the  home.  During  the  10-day  staffing  for  the  substantiated  referral,  DHS \ndocumented,  “There  was  a  discussion  of  Foster  Care  having  concerns  with  inappropriate \ndiscipline, but it has not resulted in any written plans.”   \nGiven that the most common type of substantiated maltreatment in foster homes from this \nreview  was  physical  abuse,  which  most  commonly  took  the  form  of  foster  parents  using \ninappropriate and harmful methods of discipline, DHS’ efforts must strengthen the assessment \nof referral histories to identify patterns of similar allegations and concerns, and take immediate \nand appropriate actions to mitigate risk to children.  \n \n73 \n \n\nDHS’ efforts must better support caseworkers’ and supervisors’ ability to make safety-focused \ndecisions during these post-referral joint reviews.  The Co-Neutrals’ case record review showed \nthat  in  some  cases,  caseworkers  interpreted  screened-out,  ruled  out  or  unsubstantiated \nreferrals as indicating a particular foster home was safe for children.  DHS must strengthen its \ntraining, coaching and support on the relevance of previous history, particularly emphasizing \nthat screened-out, ruled out or unsubstantiated referrals do not unequivocally mean that safety \nconcerns or risks are not present in the home and that no action by DHS is necessary to ensure \nchild safety.   \nThis period, DHS conducted a quantitative and qualitative review of its screen-out consultation \npractice and completed their analysis after the close of the current reporting period. The \nanalysis reviewed a random sample of 125 screened-out consultations completed and entered \ninto DHS’ KIDS database for the 12-month period of October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.   A \nprimary finding of the review was that of the 125 consultations reviewed, 74 consultations (59 \npercent) documented all required information to be covered during the consultation.  However, \nthe review also found that in 51 consultations (41 percent) all required information was not \ncovered during a consultation.  Further, of the 51 consultations that did not include all required \ninformation, 40 (32 percent) consultations lacked any discussion of the foster homes’ referral \nhistory.  The gap undercuts in these instances the stated purpose of screened-out consultations \nto assess child safety in foster homes through a comprehensive review of foster homes’ prior \nreferrals. \nDHS reported it has begun development of an enhanced screened-out consultation guide in \nKIDS to address some of the findings from its review.  According to DHS, the new guide will be \nreleased in KIDS in the Fall of 2018. The Co-Neutrals have urged DHS to ensure that staff receive \nsufficient guidance and instructions on the new guide as soon as possible while the technical \ncomponents of the KIDS system are completed and the field is trained on appropriate use and \ndocumentation in KIDS. \nDHS reported that during this period, DHS’ Continuous Quality Insurance (CQI) staff participated \nin five 10-day staffing calls to provide quality assurance support and technical assistance and \nthe  Office  of  Performance  Outcomes  and  Accountability  (OPOA)  participated  as  a  silent \nobserver on four post-referral staffings.  In total, DHS’ quality assurance teams participated in a \ntotal of nine post-referral joint reviews during this period.  Due to this limited number of nine \nshadowed calls, DHS reported that no recommendations could be made to strengthen the 10-\nday staffings.   \nDuring this report period, the efforts the department undertook to prevent harm to children by \nstrengthening  the  quality  of  post-referral  staffings  were  insufficient  in  scope,  focus  and \n74 \n \n\ntimeliness.   \nQuality of Caseworker Visits; Assessing Child Safety \nThis  period,  the  principal  concern  that  DHS  identified  in  its  review  of  foster  homes \nsubstantiated for maltreatment was the insufficient quality and consistency of caseworkers’ \nmonthly visits to identify and/or address issues related to child safety.  In fact, DHS identified \nthat  the  quality  of  caseworker  visits  was  inadequate  for  the  majority  of  foster  homes \nsubstantiated for maltreatment in the current review.   In its review, DHS evaluated the quality \nof worker visits to assess child safety through the following eight questions: \n(cid:120)  Did the caseworker conduct any unannounced visits to the foster home?; \n(cid:120)  If the child is an infant, was the infant observed unclothed?; \n(cid:120)  If applicable, did the caseworker address any contradicting information learned about \nthe home?;  \n(cid:120)  Did the caseworker attempt to gather information from non-verbal/pre-verbal children \nto assess safety?; \n(cid:120)  Did the caseworker discuss discipline practices with the child?; \n(cid:120)  Did the caseworker discuss safety with foster children and foster parents?; \n(cid:120)  Did the casework discuss with foster parents services to support child’s well-being?; \n(cid:120)  Did the caseworker discuss if any other people are in the home to visit or care for the \nfoster children? \nDHS  found  the  following  concerns  with  the  quality  of  worker  visits:  caseworkers  did  not \nconsistently and/or thoroughly discuss with children the discipline methods used in the foster \nhome; caseworkers did not regularly discuss child safety with foster parents; caseworkers did \nnot routinely interview children alone; and, caseworkers did not, as appropriate, address any \ncontradictory information identified about the foster home that may impact child safety.   \nThe  ongoing  concern  that  caseworkers  are  not  consistently  and/or  thoroughly  discussing \ndiscipline methods and safety with foster children during visits is particularly troubling in light \nof the prevalence of child maltreatment substantiations that involved inappropriate discipline \nmethods this period.  In fact, of the 17 referrals that involved physical abuse this period, DHS \nidentified 14 referrals with concerns related to the quality of caseworkers’ visits.  While in some \nof these referrals, caseworkers failed altogether to discuss discipline and safety with children, in \nother instances caseworkers attempted to discuss discipline and safety, but the discussions \nappeared  cursory  and  lacked  a  skillful  and  trauma-informed  approach  that  would  more \neffectively support children in disclosing maltreatment in their foster home.    \n \n75 \n \n\nFurther, the review identified that some of these foster homes substantiated for physical abuse \nhad referral histories that contained prior allegations of inappropriate discipline.  Given these \nhistories, it was incumbent upon DHS to heighten its review and assessment of child safety \nduring monthly visits.  From a review of these prior referrals with allegations of inappropriate \ndiscipline,  it  did  not  appear  caseworkers  appropriately  addressed  these  concerns  and \nallegations with the foster children or parents.   \nDHS reported that its permanency planning program staff trained seven classes of new child \nwelfare specialists, impacting approximately 140 new staff, on various areas related to child \nsafety, including the quality of worker visits and safety assessments during visits.  DHS indicated \nthe training highlighted the importance of discussing discipline and supervision during visits, \nconducting three unannounced visits per year, and increasing contact with children and foster \nfamilies during times of change and stress.  This is a valuable step; however, DHS did not \nindicate that this training would be delivered to its hundreds of permanency caseworkers \nalready deployed to the field.  \nDHS at first reported that efforts were being made to develop a tool for supervisory staff to \nevaluate, among other areas, the quality of caseworker monthly visits to assess child safety.  \nHowever, DHS later reported these efforts were suspended due to its ongoing work to develop \na new supervisory framework, which DHS indicated will include efforts related to worker visits. \nDHS shared some tools it developed through its supervisory framework to improve worker \nvisits, including guidance on the topics and issues that must be addressed during a worker visit, \nand assessment tools for supervisors to use to evaluate caseworkers’ visits to ensure child \nsafety.  (See Appendix E)  DHS reported that region by region, staggered implementation of this \nnew framework will not begin until August 2018, with a goal for full, statewide implementation \nby February 2020.  Given the serious and ongoing concerns about child maltreatment and the \ndepartment’s own observations related to the quality of worker-child visits, the department \nmust more quickly provide statewide guidance and support to staff in the field to identify and \naddress risks to child safety during monthly visits.   \nImproving the Foster Home Approval Process  \nThe  Co-Neutrals’  case  record  reviews  have  historically  revealed  concerns  regarding  the \napproval  of  some  foster  homes  with  concerning  child  welfare,  criminal  and/or  personal \nhistories.    This  period,  the  Co-Neutrals’  review  of  substantiated  maltreatment  referrals \ncontinued to identify foster homes with concerning histories that were documented during the \nhome approval process but were still approved to care for children in DHS custody.  This period, \nthe  Co-Neutrals  conducted  their  second  comprehensive  review  of  50  Resource  Family \n76 \n \n\nAssessments (RFA)33 of new homes (DHS and private agency traditional homes, and kinship \nhomes) approved by DHS and private agencies between the months of October and December \n2017.  DHS’ and the Co-Neutrals’ record reviews of new home RFAs and foster homes with \nsubstantiated MIC referrals reinforced the urgency with which DHS must improve its home \napproval process. As described below, both reviews identified child safety concerns with the \nhome approval process.    \nThe central finding of the Co-Neutrals’ review this period of 50 new home RFAs was that nearly \na quarter (24 percent) raised concerns about the family’s protective capacities to safely care for \nfoster children.  The Co-Neutrals’ review last period of 50 new homes opened between January \nand June 2017 produced a similar finding, with 23 percent raising questions about the decision \nto approve each home. The most frequently cited concern in both the current and former RFA \nreview was related to the personal backgrounds of prospective foster families, which called into \nquestion the suitability of foster parents due to issues such as:  drug and/or alcohol abuse, \ndomestic violence and/or child welfare histories involving the resource parents and/or family \nmembers.  The  Co-Neutrals  shared  with  DHS  their  findings  from  these  reviews  and  the \ndepartment reported that it has followed up on specific cases as needed to ensure the home \nwas approved appropriately and is using the information gathered to further assess where the \nresource family assessment process requires additional improvement.   \nThe Co-Neutrals reviewed and analyzed all substantiated maltreatment referrals this period for \nchildren in care, which is distinct from the Co-Neutrals’ review of 50 new home RFAs described \nabove. The maltreatment review identified foster homes with concerning home approvals.  In \nparticular, the review found some homes were approved to care for foster children despite \nchild welfare histories, the identified use of inappropriate discipline, and, in a few cases, \ncriminal histories.  It was unclear from the review if DHS addressed these issues during the \nhome  approval  process.    The  review  also  found  that  in  some  cases  the  maltreatment \nsubstantiated in a foster home was related to the concerning issue identified during the foster \nhome’s approval process.    \nDuring the home approval process for a kinship home substantiated for maltreatment this \nperiod,  for  example,  DHS  failed  to  identify  the  home’s  prior  substantiated  child  welfare \nhistory.  DHS reported that during the investigation, it was found that the foster mother had “a \n                                                      \n33 The RFA is a compilation of information that includes the background of each foster parent, all household \nmembers and closest family members of the applicant as well as information about the family’s physical home, \nfinances and medical histories.  The RFAs for DHS’ traditional and kinship foster homes are developed by five \ncontract agencies charged with objectively compiling all the relevant information so that DHS can assess the \nquality of each home and determine if there are any concerns that DHS may need to review and consider in \ngreater depth.  \n77 \n \n\nsubstantiated child welfare history for failing to protect her grandchildren against sexual abuse \nby another one of her sons.”  The current investigation, substantiated in July 2017, involved \nsimilar confirmed allegations of the foster mother allowing her other son (a convicted sex \noffender) access to the one year old foster child.  Documented in the 10-day staffing notes, DHS \nwrote, “Additionally, participants discussed [foster mother’s] substantiated CW history from \n2004 for failure to protect when another one of her sons sexually abused her grandchild and \nshe refused to believe it.   \nDHS’ Efforts to Strengthen Home Approval Process \nLast period, in response to the findings of DHS’ and the Co-Neutrals’ first review of 50 new \nhome RFAs, DHS proposed, and the Co-Neutrals approved, a detailed action plan to address the \nspecific concerns surfaced through the RFA review.  The RFA Action Plan includes: ongoing, \nquality assurance through resource home case reviews; training for staff and supervisors to \nenhance their assessment skills and use of new resource home review tools; the development \nof new training for all resource staff on conducting thorough home assessments; and guidance \non higher-level reviews and approval of homes with concerning histories.   During this period, \nDHS began to implement its RFA Action Plan.  Specifically:   \n(cid:120)  Effective  September  15,  2017,  DHS  established  a  new  protocol  that  requires  field \nmanagers to review prospective foster families that have any noted history involving \nphysical violence, substance abuse or any type of sexual-involved maltreatment. This \nnew  protocol  was  developed  in  response  to  historical  concerns  of  foster  homes \napproved with these concerning backgrounds.   \n(cid:120)  DHS provided trainings to relevant staff and supervisors to build the competencies and \ncritical thinking of the individuals charged with developing home assessments and those \nresponsible for approving them. \n(cid:120)  Continuous Quality Insurance (CQI) staff assisted with a review of 72 recently approved \nhomes that were considered high risk due to having a prior child maltreatment referral \nor Written Plan of Compliance (WPC).  DHS reported the findings of this review raised \nsimilar concerns about the home approval process decisions.   \n(cid:120)  In October 2017, DHS reported it began a review of criminal, child welfare and family \nhistories, and references on all open traditional and kinship resources.  \n(cid:120)  At the very end of the period, DHS revised the Record Check Documentation form to \npromote workers’ review and documentation of identified criminal and child welfare \nhistory.  The revised form includes three new public searches for foster and adoptive \napplicants, which are required per state statue.  In addition, the form was updated to \ninclude  an  applicant’s  account  of  any  criminal  or  child  welfare  history  and  the \ndisposition validated by higher-level staff. \n78 \n \n\n(cid:120)  Lastly, also at the end of the period, DHS developed the Initial Kinship Safety Evaluation \nand Approval tool.  According to DHS’ February 2018 Semi-Annual Summary Report, the \n“tool assists resource staff to ensure all initial kinship requirements are met and the \nchild’s safety is ensured prior to placement in a kinship placement.” The tool requires \nsupervisory approval prior to a child’s placement in the kinship resource.   \nDHS also decided to rely more substantially on resource family supervisors in the review and \napproval process of new homes.  Central to this work is ensuring that supervisors conduct \nthorough  reviews  of  all  RFAs  of  prospective  foster  homes  developed  in  their  respective \nmanagement areas.   Supervisors have always been required to document their decisions to \napprove a new home.  However, the long-standing practice had been that a team of DHS \nreaders  undertook  the  primary  review  and  approval  of  RFAs  statewide.   DHS  found  that \nsupervisors were not consistently conducting thorough reviews of new home RFAs, as required, \ninstead relying on the readers.  DHS is in the process of removing the role of the readers and re-\nestablishing the primary role of supervisors to review and approve new homes.  \nDHS developed a Resource Family Assessment Review Tool to facilitate supervisors’ review of \nRFAs.34  This tool comprehensively captures requirements that must be met by prospective \nfoster  parents  and  prompts  supervisors  to  assess  any  identified  deficiencies  or  concerns \nsurfaced through the home approval process and document, if the home is approved, how DHS \nwas able to resolve the issues to ensure child safety. DHS requires that supervisors upload the \ncompleted review tool to the KIDS digital file cabinet for the new, approved home.   In a review \nthis period of 50 new home RFAs, the Co-Neutrals observed that implementation of the review \ntool is still in its initial stages.  The Co-Neutrals found that supervisors are not yet routinely \nusing the new form to document the actions taken by DHS to address and/or mitigate any \nidentified safety concerns in the home and the form is not consistently uploaded to new \nhomes’ resource file cabinets in KIDS. \nCore Strategies to Reduce MIC in Facilities \nThroughout this report period, there continued to be an overwhelmingly disproportionate rate \nof child maltreatment in institutional settings. Based on the MIC data reported for this period, \nwhich showed that 16 more children were abused and neglected in institutional settings than \nduring the last period, the Co-Neutrals have serious concerns about DHS’ efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress for child safety in institutional settings.  \n                                                      \n34 This period, DHS created the Resource Family Assessment Review Tool by combining two prior tools - the \nResource Approval Checklist, which was completed by the assigned supervisor to ensure all requirements are met \nby applicants for full resource approval, and the RFA Review Tool, which is used by both the Co-Neutrals and DHS \nin their respective reviews of the home approval process. \n79 \n \n\nBetween October 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017, DHS substantiated the maltreatment of 60 \nchildren placed in institutional settings, compared to 44 children for the prior period. These 60 \nchild victims were identified in 41 distinct substantiated referrals. Investigators determined \nchildren were abused or neglected in 24 distinct institutional settings in Oklahoma this period. \nAs the Table below illustrates, the majority of child victims and distinct substantiations during \nthe current period were heavily concentrated among six institutions. \nTable 7: Institutions with More Than One Substantiation, October 2016 to September 2017 \n# of Distinct  # of Child \nResource  \nSubstantiations  Victims \nFacility 1*  8  9 \nFacility 2**  4  9 \nFacility 3  4  5 \nLaura Dester  3  4 \nFacility 4  2  2 \nFacility 5  2  3 \nTOTAL   23 of 41  32 of 60 \nPercent of Total \n56%   53%  \nSubstantiations This Period \n                               *This facility is now closed.   \n                               ** DHS placed a hold on new placements at this facility as of March 28, 2018. \nThe recurrence of child maltreatment at these six institutions this period raises questions about \nDHS’ capacity to effectively address and remedy identified safety concerns in institutions where \nit places children. Following the close of this data report period, three of these institutions \ncontinued to report additional, confirmed child maltreatment.  \nDuring the fall of 2015, DHS began implementing a series of commitments to expand and \nstrengthen protocols for oversight, monitoring, and engagement with higher-level institutions \nto  reduce  the  risk  of  maltreatment  of  children  and  youth  living  in  institutional  settings.  \nSpecifically, these protocols require DHS to initiate and enforce corrective actions to mitigate \nany identified safety concerns in an institution. For those institutions with confirmed child \nmaltreatment, DHS is to apply heightened monitoring and oversight to ensure the timely and \nfull resolution of safety concerns.  DHS also committed through new contract requirements to \nensure that all group home facility staff are trained on Managing Aggressive Behaviors (MAB), a \nmodel of positive youth development selected by DHS to prevent child restraints and de-\nescalate behavioral challenges presented by children and youth.   \nDuring this report period, the Co-Neutrals observed DHS’ continued implementation of these \ncommitments, with varied rigor and to varying degrees of effectiveness.  Despite these efforts, \n80 \n \n\nthe rate of maltreatment increased in institutional settings for this report period.  In a review of \nthree institutions that were the sites of multiple child maltreatment substantiations this period, \nthe Co-Neutrals found, as documented by DHS, ongoing safety concerns that placed children at \nincreased  risk  of  maltreatment  during  the  period.  One  of  these  institutions  is  the  state-\noperated shelter, the Laura Dester Children’s Center.  Included below is a detailed summary of \nthe safety concerns identified by DHS and the Co-Neutrals at the shelter that led to a dramatic \nincrease in child maltreatment between October 2017 and May 2018.    \nDHS’ Efforts to Reduce Child Maltreatment in Institutional Settings \nIn 2015, DHS designed a protocol to delineate the steps DHS and facilities must take during and \nfollowing  an  investigation  of  maltreatment,  or  when  any  issue  affecting  child  safety  is \nidentified. In a review this period, the Co-Neutrals observed that Specialized Placement and \nPartnership  Unit  (SPPU)  liaisons  initiated  actions  following  an  investigation  but  did  not \nconsistently remedy the identified concerns. DHS often initiated a corrective action plan (CAP) \nfollowing an investigation to address any employee-specific concerns.  However, the review \nfound that Facility Action Steps (FAS) were less often initiated to address facility-wide (or \nagency-wide) practices or conditions of concern, including contract compliance, inadequate \ntraining,  poor  staffing  levels,  over-use  of  restraints  and  inadequate  supervisory  oversight.  \nGiven that some of the facilities had systemic or cultural concerns identified by DHS that were \nnot effectively addressed to reduce the risk of harm to children, the department missed critical \nopportunities to promote child safety.    \nDHS committed in 2015 to undertake heightened monitoring of institutions with the highest \nnumber of maltreatment substantiations. This is supposed to include, among other activities, \nquarterly audits with facility leadership to review agency data and performance; bi-weekly \nheightened monitoring meetings within DHS to track safety and progress on risk mitigation; and \na  formal  accountability  process  when  improvements  are  not  implemented  by  established \ndeadlines. The facilities subject to heightened monitoring are selected quarterly based on DHS’ \nmost current child maltreatment data, which identifies institutions with the highest number of \nMIC substantiations for the period. Since the inception of heightened monitoring in 2015, DHS \nhas identified 21 group homes and shelters it determined required intensified oversight to \naddress identified child safety concerns. Nineteen of these facilities participated in heightened \nmonitoring, while two declined. Of these 19 facilities, nine are no longer providing placement to \nchildren in DHS custody due to contract termination or closure.  One of these facilities is the \nstate-operated Laura Dester shelter, which the Co-Neutrals ordered DHS to cease using due to \nconcerns for children’s safety.  As of July 31, 2018, eight of the 19 facilities have not had any \nconfirmed child maltreatment following the implementation of their heightened monitoring \nimprovement  plans.    The  remaining  two  facilities  are  currently  subject  to  heightened \n81 \n \n\nmonitoring  and,  as  discussed  below,  have  experienced  recurrent  maltreatment  after  the \ninitiation of heightened monitoring. \nAs DHS committed in its core strategies, each facility subject to heightened monitoring had an \nactive Facility Services Plan (FSP) during the report period.  The FSP is a rolling document \ncreated  and  maintained  by  the  assigned  SPPU  liaison  to  track  and  monitor  a  facility’s \nmaltreatment  referral  history  and  all  identified  child  safety  risk  factors.  The  Co-Neutrals \nobserved that on the FSP for each facility subject to heightened monitoring, the SPPU worker \nrecorded their observations monthly from their visits to the facility, and made note of issues \nthat needed to be addressed.  For three of the institutions with multiple substantiations, SPPU \nworkers  documented  ongoing,  unresolved  concerns  with  the  facility  in  the  FSP  as  DHS \ncontinued to place new children there.  For example, in DHS’ FSP for a Level E group home, DHS \ndocumented its efforts, observations, and concerns for each month the institution was subject \nto heightened monitoring from January 2017 to December 2017.    During 12 months of \nmonitoring and engagement by DHS at this facility, DHS consistently documented concerns of a \nprevailing culture of “control and compliance” with children that did not adequately include \n“trauma  responsive  elements”  of  care,  staff  failing  to  engage  with  youth,  and  facility \nleadership’s reluctance to take steps toward improving the quality of care provided to children.  \nAs  these  concerns  continued  despite  DHS’  oversight  of  the  facility,  maltreatment  of  five \nchildren was confirmed at the facility between June 2017 and December 2017.  As of June 2018, \nthere were four additional pending investigations at this institution with allegations of child \nabuse and neglect while DHS continued to place children there. \nThe Co-Neutrals found similar issues at another Level E group home that cares for children who \nare 12 years of age and younger with higher-level behavioral and emotional challenges and \nneeds.  This group home first became subject to DHS’ heightened monitoring in November \n2015.  The  Co-Neutrals  observed  that  over  nearly  two  years,  DHS  has  provided  enhanced \noversight and increased its presence, particularly during periods of instability at the facility.  \nHowever, these efforts have not prevented continued incidents of child maltreatment at the \nfacility.  Significant  concerns  for  child  safety  remain  regarding  a  lack  of  adequate  staff \nsupervision and errors in the administration of prescribed medications, which have continued \nto result in harm to children.  During this report period, investigators determined nine children \nwere abused and neglected at this institution. Since the close of the reporting period, four \nadditional  children  were  maltreated.    As  of  June  2018,  there  were  an  additional  two \ninvestigations pending with allegations related to lack of supervision and improper medication \n82 \n \n\nadministration.35 \nSupporting Group Homes to Therapeutically Manage Child Behavior \nDuring this report period, institutional staff physically abused 19 (32 percent) of the 60 child \nmaltreatment victims in institutional settings.  In response to historical concerns of children \nbeing subject to improper and/or unnecessary physical holds and restraints, DHS contractually \nrequired all group homes to adopt the MAB positive behavioral management model, which \nemphasizes de-escalation techniques. DHS committed to reduce the number of restraints and \nother non-therapeutic interventions that were used against children and youth in the state’s \ncustody.  DHS  made  available  to  group  home  staff  the  resources  of  Oklahoma’s  Trauma-\nInformed Care Project (TICP) to coach and build the expertise of each group home’s MAB \nexperts and help to address child-specific challenges.  This period, DHS reported higher-level \ninstitutions participated in a number of MAB related trainings.  However, a DHS investigation of \nchild maltreatment at Laura Dester, initiated in February 2018 (three months after MAB was \nreportedly fully implemented at the shelter and two months after the close of the reporting \nperiod), identified the following: \n(cid:120)  Concerns that staff do not fully understand the concepts of MAB; \n(cid:120)  Floor restraints of children, which are prohibited under MAB, are commonly used at the \nshelter.  In addition, the investigation identified that floor restraints appear to be \nunder-reported  at  the  shelter  and  shelter  administration  is  not  monitoring  the \noccurrence and use of floor restraints; \n(cid:120)  It was reported the staff use whatever means necessary when in a physical restraint \nwith children; and, \n(cid:120)  It appears no one from administration is following up to ensure staff completes the \nrequired MAB training. \nAs the Co-Neutrals reported in the last Commentary, staff at some institutions have not fully \nadopted the MAB practice model.  \nLaura Dester and Child Safety \nDuring the reporting period, the Co-Neutrals continued to express grave concerns about child \nsafety at Laura Dester to DHS leadership.  For more than two years, DHS used Laura Dester as a \nplacement  for  children  from  across  the  state  with  complex  behavioral,  medical  and \ndevelopmental challenges or who, for other reasons, DHS could not locate a family or needs-\n                                                      \n35 As of this report writing, DHS currently has a hold on any new placements in this facility.   \n83 \n \n\nbased placement. Despite the acute nature of the behaviors and therapeutic and medical needs \nof many of the children placed at Laura Dester, DHS did not establish conditions that would \nensure a reasonable level of safety.  \nIn the third Commentary issued in October 2014, the Co-Neutrals first began to report concerns \nregarding incident reports and the lack of sufficient staffing and expertise to meet the higher-\nlevel medical and therapeutic needs of many of the children placed at both Laura Dester and \nPauline E. Mayer, the other state-operated shelter open at that time.  The Co-Neutrals have \ncontinued to present to DHS ongoing, similar and at times more serious concerns about the \ncare and safety of children at Laura Dester.  DHS had previously announced plans to close or \ndiscontinue using Laura Dester as a children’s shelter by December 31, 2015.   DHS made this \ndecision as an extension of its original commitment under its Pinnacle Plan to discontinue by \nJuly 2014 placing any child ages 12 and under in a shelter or other non-family based setting \nunless they met an allowed exception to keep siblings together or a child with a minor parent in \ncustody.  \nAfter closing the Pauline E. Mayer state-operated shelter in November 2015, DHS announced \nthat due to a lack of family and need-based placements, it would not be able to close Laura \nDester until January 2017 but that routine, new admissions would end by October 2015.  Any \nnew child placements would be allowed only by permission of the child welfare director and in \nvery specific circumstances after exhaustive efforts were shown to have failed to secure an \nalternate needs-based placement for the child, preferably in a family based setting.  DHS \nannounced that it would close the shelter after the last child was placed out of Laura Dester.  By \nFebruary 2016, DHS had made efforts to reduce the population at Laura Dester to nine children. \nHowever, by November of 2016, the number of children placed at the shelter rose again to 20-\n30 placements at any given time and DHS leadership reported that closure of the shelter by \nJanuary 2017 was unlikely.   \nThroughout the most recent 2017 calendar year, the Co-Neutrals had numerous discussions \nwith DHS about ongoing concerns with respect to the safety of children at Laura Dester and the \nquality of their care.  Some of these discussions were prompted by specific incidents, including: \na child who was tased and handcuffed at the shelter by local police; a child whose medical \nneeds were reported by medical professionals to exceed the medical care capacity of the \nshelter; and the Co-Neutrals’ direct observations at the shelter of poor supervision of children \nand limited resources for staff. Throughout these discussions, DHS promised repeatedly to \nexpand staff capacity through additional hiring and training.   \nAs noted above, the need for additional, well-trained staff was exacerbated when DHS’ child \nplacements at Laura Dester raised the population to 44 children by June 30, 2017.  After a visit \nto the shelter in July 2017, the Co-Neutrals conferred with DHS leadership about a number of \n84 \n \n\nconcerning observations, primarily regarding shelter staff’s lack of supervision, engagement and \nability to safely manage the needs of children at Laura Dester. DHS leadership pledged that \nimprovement work was in progress. \nIn September 2017, the Co-Neutrals met with a broad group of DHS and shelter staff and \nleadership, as DHS requested the opportunity to present all of its efforts to improve safety and \nthe quality of care at Laura Dester.  DHS presented a number of actions planned or underway, \nincluding that: \n(cid:120)  DHS reported it had developed a Continuous Improvement Model plan as part of its \nSPPU Heightened Monitoring team work. The plan addressed physical interventions \nwith  appropriate  documentation  and  debriefings,  including  new  incident  forms,  to \nensure more accurate accounting of incidents and as a self-reflecting learning tool to \nimprove  de-escalation  skills.    The  plan  also  included  specific  tasks  to  improve \nengagement and use of skill-based activities with the children and quality assessment of \nstaff’s use of MAB and additional MAB coaching as needed.  \n(cid:120)  DHS assigned a SPPU liaison to work solely with Laura Dester and to employ Heightening \nMonitoring full time.   \n(cid:120)  DHS said it planned to hire 15-20 additional direct care staff to reach a 1:4 ratio and \nallow for 20 direct care staff for each shift. \n(cid:120)  DHS planned to bring on four child welfare specialists (one assigned to each cottage); \nthree  recreational  staff  and  a  program  coordinator;  a  full-time  (M-F,  8am  –  3pm) \nteacher to provide educational instruction for children not attending public school at \nany point in time; and, a resident advocate.  The shelter director said that they had \nalready identified the program coordinator and resident advocate.  \n(cid:120)  DHS was retrofitting Cottage D, which was previously designed for infants and toddlers, \nto have more living space for older children and to better separate children based on \ntheir sensory needs.  \n(cid:120)  DHS  was  continuing  to  implement  the  Journey  program  designed  to  help  children \nprogressively learn to manage their behaviors.  This program had been in place at Laura \nDester for some time through a contract with River Parks Developmental Center.    \n(cid:120)  DHS was mapping the best way to complete an intake on a new placement (getting \ninformation about the children, sharing information with staff, and developing safety \nplans).   \n(cid:120)  DHS was continuing multi-disciplinary staffing to identify alternate placements that best \nmeet the needs for permanency and well-being for children at Laura Dester. \n(cid:120)  DHS was continuing to coordinate and expand efforts of DDS and child welfare to meet \nthe therapeutic placement needs of children with developmental disabilities.   \n85 \n \n\nUnfortunately,  DHS’  plans  did  not  adequately  ensure  children’s  safety  or  mitigate  the \nsubstantial  risks  to  child  safety  that  reoccurs  in  the  allegations  of  child  maltreatment \ninvestigated by OCA over the past year. The increase in child maltreatment observed at Laura \nDester over the last year coincided with a sharp increase in the number of children placed at \nthe shelter. DHS reached its lowest population of children at Laura Dester during the first half of \n2016, which corresponds to a much lower number of maltreatment substantiations recorded \nfor the first semi-annual period from October 2016 to March 2017.  During the following \nperiod, April 2017 – September 2017, DHS substantiated two referrals that involved a total of \nthree children. And following that, from October 2017 – March 2018, DHS substantiated eight \nmore abuse and neglect referrals that involved 10 children.  DHS’ own records present, with an \noverwhelming and compounding amount of detail, the unacceptably high level of risk and \nunsafe conditions created by placing together in one facility so many children with significant \nand complex needs and behaviors without ensuring an appropriate level of staff, training, and \norganizational and programmatic management and oversight.  \nThe Co-Neutrals’ concerns snowballed with the precipitous increase in child maltreatment at \nLaura Dester between October 2017 and March 2018.  The Co-Neutrals reviewed over 100 \nabuse/neglect referrals prior to March 2018; over 1,000 incident reports; DHS internal records, \npolicies, and operational documents and communications.  The Co-Neutrals visited the site and \nmade direct observations at Laura Dester before, during and after the report period, and \nparticipated in years of discussions with DHS leadership regarding concerns about DHS’ efforts \nto establish safe, quality care for children placed at the shelter.  \nSummary of Operational and Safety Concerns at Laura Dester \nAmid growing concern that the rate of maltreatment at Laura Dester showed an alarming and \nsubstantial upward negative trend with respect to the number of children in the state’s custody \nwho were abused or neglected while placed at the shelter, the Co-Neutrals, on March 5, 2018 \ndirected DHS to cease placing any additional children in this state-operated children’s shelter.   \nUnder Section 2.14 of the CSA, the Co-Neutrals are granted the authority to require DHS to \nundertake and maintain diagnostic and remedial activities when the department fails to achieve \npositive trending or begins to trend negatively in any area. Further, the Co‐Neutrals directed \nDHS to develop and submit a transition plan to place all children out of the Laura Dester shelter \nby a date to be determined but not later than June 30, 2018.  \nDespite the Co-Neutrals’ order of March 5, 2018, that DHS cease all admissions to the shelter \ndue to serious concerns about child safety, DHS placed a 13-year-old boy at Laura Dester on \nMarch 7, 2018.  On March 28, 2018, a staff person at Laura Dester physically punched that \nsame  child.  On  April  25,  2018,  DHS  substantiated  child  abuse.    In  its  investigation,  OCA \ndocumented  that  the  staff  person  failed  to  employ  de-escalation  techniques  in  his \n86 \n \n\nengagements with the child, and instead escalated the situation by engaging physically and \naggressively.   \nOn March 15, 2018, DHS submitted to the Co-Neutrals a memorandum with its Proposed Plan \nto Eliminate Laura Dester Children’s Center as an Emergency Shelter, including an express \ncommitment that “[g]oing forward, the Office of Client Advocacy will ensure all pending and \nincoming investigations involving [Laura Dester] are completed within required timeframes so \nthat critical information needed to make safety and/or personnel decisions is available in a \ntimely manner,” which the department simply never honored. 36 The department’s latest plan \nalso listed other efforts which the agency represented would improve safety conditions and \noversight at the shelter, but subsequent child abuse/neglect referrals at Laura Dester after the \nplan’s submission strongly suggested otherwise.   \n \nDHS Documented Areas of Concern at Laura Dester \nDHS records reveal many safety and quality of care concerns at Laura Dester. Two primary \nareas of concern were the use of excessive force or other inappropriate actions by staff against \nchildren and the lack of adequate staff supervision of children.  In June 2016, the University of \nOklahoma’s National Resource Center for Youth Services completed a program assessment of \nLaura  Dester.  The  program  assessment,  while  completed  two  years  ago,  offers  a  cogent \nsummary  of  the  risks  to  child  safety  that  remained  present  in  the  reporting  period.  The \nassessment listed the following areas as needing programmatic improvement: \n(cid:120)  Current staffing and programming is not designed to meet the specific needs of many of \nthe young people currently residing at the shelter. (The assessment reported that the \nlast child maltreatment substantiation was due to staff not having proper training in the \nuse of a feeding tube, resulting in a child not being fed.) \n(cid:120)  Staff continue to struggle in positively engaging those young people at the shelter who \nexhibit  more  challenging  behaviors,  often  referring  to  these  young  people  as \n“delinquent.” \n(cid:120)  Requests for specialized equipment to assist with the activities of daily living for some of \nthe residents have been difficult to meet. \n                                                      \n36 The Office of Client Advocacy (OCA) is part of DHS’ organization but is separate from the main child welfare \nagency.   OCA investigates reports of child abuse and neglect in institutional settings while Child Protective Services \n(CPS), which is part of DHS’ child welfare agency investigates reports of child abuse and neglect in family settings, \nincluding foster homes. \n87 \n \n\n(cid:120)  Staff  are  struggling  to  keep  all  the  young  people  actively  engaged  in  meaningful, \ndevelopmentally appropriate activity. \n(cid:120)  Staff  need  training  and  supervision  regarding  working  with  young  people  with \nintellectual disabilities or require assistance in self-care, mobility, and communication, \nas well as those young people whose development, behavior, and relationships are \nimpacted by traumatic histories. \n(cid:120)  In order to keep shifts covered, many staff are working double shifts and extensive \novertime. Staff are tired and get little relief from this highly stressful situation. This can \nhave an impact on their ability to provide consistent therapeutic interactions. \n(cid:120)  Some staff forget the developmental level or the traumatic histories of the youth they \nare working with. Some staff may not understand the needs of the youth or what sorts \nof interventions would be helpful. \n(cid:120)  Some staff are not skilled at noticing when youth are in the initial stages of crisis, so \ninterventions do not come until much later in the escalation. \nOver a year after this program assessment identified concerns with the quality of care at the \nshelter,  Tom  Bates,  who  at  the  time  served  as  Special  Adviser  to  Governor  Mary  Fallin \nand Interim Advocate General of the Office of Client Advocacy (OCA) at DHS, forwarded to DHS \nchild welfare leadership in a January 12, 2018 email a list of safety and quality of care concerns \nat the shelter observed by OCA staff familiar with abuse/neglect investigations at Laura Dester. \nThe email contained the following:37 \nAttached are a list of concerns about the shelter that were submitted to me by \nOCA staff. I know you continue to work on securing adequate staffing, but one \nissue that continues to come up is the availability of supervisors and the support \nthey are providing to staff on the floor. Is there a plan to address that issue? In \norder to take full advantage of our time with Jim Powell, it is imperative that \nsupervisors and MAB trainers be on the floor with him. I understand that those \npersonnel may have been covering other duties so let us know what we would \nneed to do to get you the support you need. Director Lake has made clear that he \nwill make that support happen.  \n \n \n \n                                                      \n37 Through an independent review of substantiated, unsubstantiated and screened out referrals from Laura \nDester, the Co-Neutrals identified a number of the specific referrals and reports that directly formed the basis of \nMr. Bates’ January 12 email, some of which are summarized below.   \n88 \n \n\nConcerns regarding Laura Dester:  \n \n1. [Staff X] been observed in the Cottages since he has been placed on no contact. \n[Staff X] has a current referral where he is seen on video and placing his hands \naround a child’s neck and forcing him to the floor. He is also seen on video on top \nof a child during a restraint. Safety Plans are not being followed.  \n \n2. Not enough staff in the cottages. It was reported the ratios that are currently \nin place do not match the level of supervision needed for the types of children \nplaced at the facility.  \n \n3. It was reported the staff have been given the task of supervising up to 8 \nresidents, which is an unreasonable expectation.  \n \n4. Supervisors stay in the administration building, even though the supervisors \nare aware the staff are struggling to maintain order in the cottages.  \n \n5. It was reported when the supervisors are called for assistance they either do \nnot answer the phone or they arrive after the incident passed.  \n \n6. It was reported the administration that comes in on the weekend is no help to \nthe staff and does not serve a purpose, as they are not on the cottages assisting \nthe staff.  \n \n7. It was reported staff are working multiple 16 hour shift a week, which makes \nthem irritable and less effective. LDCC has a policy in regards to mandatory \novertime, which does not give them any choice as to when they can go home. \nThis was reported to be occurring 3-4 times a week. This alone puts the children \nat great risk for neglect and or abuse, not to mention we are forcing staff to \nneglect their own families in order to keep their jobs.  \n \n8.  Staff  are  having  conversation  about  not  feeling  supported  from  their \nsupervisors and administration.  \n \n9. It was reported the staff are not receiving adequate training for the population \nthat is currently placed at the shelter.  \n \n10. It was reported a countless number of children are not enrolled in school and \nnot on homebound services.  \n \n11. It was reported the CWS assigned to the children placed at the facility are not \nreceiving  daily/weekly  incident  reports  on  their  children,  therefore  they  are \nunaware as to how bad the environment and behaviors are at the facility.  \n \n89 \n \n\n12. There are concerns children are discharging from the facility with more issues \nthan they arrived with.  \n \n13. It has been reported there is a disconnect between the Shelter SW’s and the \nCWS assigned to the children.  \n \n14. It has been reported the kitchen is not serving adequate amounts of food for \nthe children, and the food that is served is terrible quality.  \n \n15. It was said that African American residents do not have the appropriate \nproducts to keep their hair healthy, and are not be taken to get their hair cared \nfor.  \n \n16. It was reported the residents are not receiving adequate therapy at the \nfacility  and  have  severe  trauma,  abuse,  and  neglect  in  their  history.  These \nchildren are staying at LDCC for extended periods of time and need/deserve \ntreatment.  \n \n17. Residents are being sexually abused by other residents, and then remain on \nthe same campus with them. We would not allow this in a home setting, so why \nis this happening at a DHS shelter? \n  \n18. Staff are moved around from cottage to cottage therefore they do not build \nsolid relationships with the children.  \n \nHeightened Monitoring at Laura Dester \nDuring the report period, in September 2017, following two substantiated referrals of child \nmaltreatment at the shelter, DHS decided to make Laura Dester fully subject to heightened \nmonitoring through the SPPU program office. In addition, beginning in October 2017, a lead \nDHS staff person began bi-monthly visits to the shelter to observe both shelter staff and \nleadership and to address identified concerns that impact children’s safety while placed at the \nshelter.  The Co-Neutrals’ review of the Laura Dester shelter’s FSP for September 2017 through \nDecember 2017, as well as over 100 SPPU contact notes from January through March 2018 \nrevealed  that  DHS’  SPPU  unit’s  ongoing,  documented  observations  mirror,  but  did  not \nameliorate, many of the child safety concerns lifted up by DHS’ Office of Client Advocacy, as \nsummarized in Mr. Bates’ January 2018 email, and those highlighted in the program assessment \ncompleted in June 2016.  \nThe confirmed allegations of maltreatment at Laura Dester include incidents of children being \nchoked, punched and kicked. In one instance, a referral was made on October 4, 2017 that on \nan unknown date, in the cottage kitchen, a 12 year old child knocked a container of Gatorade \n90 \n \n\non  the  kitchen  floor.    Since  he  had  just  cleaned  the  kitchen  floor,  the  staff  person  was \nreportedly upset by the spilt juice.  The staff person placed the child in a headlock, which is an \nunapproved  hold.  On  March  30,  2018,  OCA  substantiated  child  abuse.  The  staff  person \nsubstantiated in this referral is the same staff person responsible for abuse in three other \nmaltreatment referrals. Following the first abuse referral on August 18, 2017 this staff person \nwas subject to a Plan for Immediate Safety (PFIS), which stipulated that he was not to have any \ncontact with residents.  As evidenced by three subsequent incidents of substantiated abuse \nafter this initial August 18th referral, DHS did not comply with the safety plan and the staff \nperson continued to abuse children. This typifies much of DHS’ approach to child safety at Laura \nDester: warning lights that often went unheeded in a timely way. \nThere are numerous instances, as well, where DHS did not substantiate maltreatment, but the \ninvestigation revealed serious harm to the child.  In one such case, a first-hand report was made \nby shelter staff that on December 1, 2017, a seven year old child who is non-verbal and deaf, \nwas found in the bathtub with water pouring onto the bathroom floor and into the hallway. A \ndirect care staff person was observed jerking the child out of the bathtub, pulling the child’s \nears and slinging the child across the bathroom and bedroom floors, causing the child’s hip to \nhit the edge of the bed. Heightened monitoring and child welfare staff confirmed observing the \nstaff  person  becoming  increasingly  agitated  with  children  and  holding  another  child,  in  a \nseparate incident, on the ground in a threatening manner.  Several days after this bathtub \nincident, the seven year old child presented with a large bruise on his buttocks, a nickel-size \nbruise on his hip and a 1-2 inch scratch. The investigation interviews and notes reported that \nthe staff person in question lacked credibility and did not provide appropriate care to children. \nOCA’s investigation resulted in an unsubstantiated finding of abuse on December 14, 2017, but \ndid confirm caretaker misconduct.  \nStaffing challenges: lack of supervision   \nChild neglect in the form of inadequate supervision was the most frequently reported allegation \nin the records the Co-Neutrals reviewed at Laura Dester. Given the medical, behavioral, and/or \ndevelopmental challenges of many of the children placed at the shelter, adequate supervision \nof children is imperative to protect children. In its first month (September 2017) of heightened \nmonitoring at Laura Dester, SPPU documented that “youth were roaming around the cottages \nand outside unsupervised.”  In each subsequent monthly update through January 2018, SPPU \ndocumented observations regarding the lack of supervision, including concerns that children \nwith problematic behaviors were observed without any supervision at the shelter.   \nSome of the children at the shelter, due to their specialized needs, require one-on-one, line of \nsight  supervision.    In  some  cases,  these  children  who  require  constant  supervision  were \ndocumented  as  unsupervised  by  shelter  staff.  For  example,  on  January  11,  2018,  SPPU \n91 \n \n\n“observed a client on heightened supervision alone.”  Referrals monitored by SPPU in contact \nnotes also documented the unsafe outcomes that resulted from a lack of supervision, including \nchildren: physically assaulting one another; presenting with unexplained injuries; and missing \nfrom care (MFC).   \nA leading factor contributing to a lack of supervision was the significant deficiency in DHS’ \nefforts  to  establish  and  implement  accountability  processes  at  the  shelter.  Most  notably, \nshelter management did not adequately train staff on a process to identify, document and track \nwhich direct care staff person was assigned to which child(ren) for each shift.38  DHS also did \nnot establish a process to ensure that direct care staff consistently was made aware of all \nprecautions they needed to take in order to safely care for each child assigned to them.  DHS \nimplemented new accountability processes that were intended to inform staff of each child’s \nspecialized  needs  and  supervisory  requirements  (i.e.,  food  allergies,  aggressive  or  SAO \nbehaviors, requirement for 1:1 supervision) but during an unannounced visit to Laura Dester \ncommencing  at  6:00am,  the  Co-Neutrals  on  April  9,  2018  observed  a  substantial  lack  of \nconsistency in staff’s implementation of these improved accountability processes.  In particular, \nthe Co-Neutrals observed concerns related to staff documenting the required, minimum 15-\nminute checks for each child and when the supervision of a child changes within a shift from \none staff person to another.  Further, staff were not documenting if they observed a new injury \non the child(ren) assigned to them. Of the 22 accountability sheets (one for each child on \ncampus) completed for the first shift on April 9, 2018, the Co-Neutrals found that this new \ninjury section was completed on only five of the sheets.  \nNumerous substantiated child maltreatment referrals revealed ongoing problems regarding \nshelter  staff  supervising  children,  particularly  those  who  have  specialized  needs  and \nvulnerabilities.  An  eight  year  old  child  who  is  autistic  and  non-verbal  and  requires  1:1 \nsupervision due to his specialized needs and vulnerabilities was able in March 2018 to enter a \nbathroom and put himself in the bathtub with water without staff knowledge.  Once staff \nbecame aware the child was in the bath, they proceeded to leave him unattended in the \nbathtub with the exception of implementing five-minute checks.  The investigation clearly \nidentified that the safety risks on this day were due to inadequate supervision and training of \nnew DCS staff, especially as related to children with heightened needs.  On the day of the \nincident the shift supervisor assigned two staff to the cottage where the child was placed.  The \ntwo staff were new, both having worked less than a week in the cottages.  In addition, staff \nperson A was instructed to shadow staff person B who reported it being only her third official \n                                                      \n38 There are three shifts in each day’s 24-hour period: first shift is 6:45am – 3:15pm; second shift is 2:45pm – \n11:15pm; third shift is 10:45pm – 7:15am.  These shift overlaps by 30 minutes to allow for shift change briefings \nand continuous supervision.  \n92 \n \n\nday working in the cottages. The supervisor said that his rationale for placing two new staff in \nthe same cottage without supervision was that this cottage had the lowest census and the \nresidents in the cottage were typically “easier” to take care of.  However, as the Co-Neutrals \ndiscovered, the children typically placed in that cottage were children with developmental \ndisabilities who required heightened supervision and care.  The supervisor reported that the \nsupervision level for children in that cottage was “Line of Sight,” reflecting the increased needs \nof this population of children.  However, the supervisor reported that the Master Log did not \nnotate that “Line of Sight” supervision is required for children in this cottage.  According to \nDHS,  “[The  new  staff]  had  not  been  made  aware  of  [the  child’s]  diagnosis  or  level  of \nsupervision…[The  supervisor]  had  a  responsibility  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  resident  by \nproviding adequate supervision with an appropriate caretaker, as he was the supervisor on \nduty.    [The  supervisor]  admitted  the  children  in  Cottage  D  were  to  have  Line  of  Sight \nsupervision; however, he failed to advise either [new staff member].”   \nBoth new staff reported that their training was limited in regards to the care of children, the \nguidelines of care in the cottages, and daily schedules.  Both reported that during training they \nwere not informed of children who could not be left alone in the bathtub.  In addition, they \nboth reported being unaware of the eight year old child’s diagnoses and specialized needs.     \nThe DHS investigative report stated that the supervisor “failed to ensure [both new staff] had \nthe necessary need-specific information to provide appropriate care and supervision to [the \nchild],  which  could  have  resulted  in  serious  physical  injury.”  On  June  28,  2018,  DHS \nsubstantiated Neglect – Threat of Harm to the supervisor on duty.  \nThis investigation found that the same child had been observed at school with dried feces on \nhis socks and legs.  It was also reported that school staff attempted to contact Laura Dester \nwhen the child needed to be removed from school and it would sometimes be hours before any \none from the shelter arrived to attend to the child.  \nOn July 5, 2017, staff brought a non-verbal nine year old child on an outing to the Tulsa Air and \nSpace  Museum.    Two  vans  transported  the  children  to  the  shelter  and  four  staff  were \nresponsible for supervision during the outing.  After the visit to the museum, while traveling \nback to the shelter in one of the vans, a staff person received a phone call that the nine year old \nchild was still at the museum, having been left behind at the museum by shelter staff. The \ninvestigation  identified  that  the  outing  to  the  museum  was  poorly  organized  and  the \nappropriate level of planning and supervision to ensure child safety was not demonstrated by \nshelter staff.  In particular, the investigation found that safety protocols such as conducting a \nhead count of children prior to leaving the museum and documenting which van transported \nwhich children, were not followed. On January 31, 2018, DHS substantiated Neglect – Lack of \nSupervision against the four staff responsible for supervision during the outing. After returning \n93 \n \n\nto the shelter, the child was observed with a burn on his left forearm that measured 2X2 inches \nand was identified by the nursing staff as a second degree burn.   Due to the child being non-\nverbal, the investigation was unable to determine how the child sustained the injury.  The \ninvestigation notes that the child did not have the mark prior to the outing to the museum.  \nOCA substantiated Neglect – Failure to Protect against an unknown caretaker. This same child \nwas physically injured and maltreated several months before this incident as confirmed in a \nseparate maltreatment investigation at Laura Dester.    \nIn addition to the numerous substantiated allegations of maltreatment for lack of supervision, \nthe Co-Neutrals reviewed 36 maltreatment investigations that closed between September 2016 \nand March 2018 with an unsubstantiated finding. The majority of these investigations (25) \ninvolved allegations of a lack of supervision. One referral involved a six year old who is non-\nverbal and autistic missing from the campus for 45 minutes on October 15, 2017, during which \ntime a car had to stop abruptly to avert hitting the child as the child had crossed the busy \nthoroughfare in front of the shelter. The investigation report showed that Laura Dester staff \nwas aware that this child was a “runner” but still did not maintain sufficient supervision to \nprevent the child from leaving the shelter campus alone.   \nA plan for immediate safety (PFIS) was established the next day stating, “shelter staff will \nmaintain line-of-sight supervision of [this child] at all times.” Two days after this PFIS was \nestablished, this same six year old again went missing and was later found by staff in a vacant \nroom taking a bath unsupervised.  (Note: the vulnerable child involved in this incident is \ndifferent from the children involved in similar bathtub incidents referenced above.)  \nIt was reported that on November 10, 2017, two children, one who is autistic and non-verbal \n(age six) and the other who is non-verbal and deaf (age 12) were left unsupervised, outside in \nthe  shelter  courtyard  and  unable  to  re-enter  the  shelter  for  30  minutes.    Both  of  these \nvulnerable children were assigned one-on-one supervision but their assigned staff were on a \nsmoking break.  A shelter staff person who was on light duty (could only sit) observed this \nincident. DHS screened out the allegations and did not assign this referral for investigation, \nnoting that lack of supervision is a licensing violation. \nStaffing Challenges \nThroughout DHS’ records, staffing shortages are reported to have limited staff’s ability to \nsufficiently supervise and engage children at the shelter. DHS reported to the Co-Neutrals in \nSeptember 2017 that Laura Dester intended to hire what the agency reported to be 42 direct \ncare staff, including two recreation  staff and three child welfare specialists. However, the \nshelter director reported on April 9, 2018 that because of high turnover, there had been a very \nlimited  net  gain  of  direct  care  staff.  Further  the  new  resident  advocate  and  program \n94 \n \n\ncoordinator positions that DHS promised in September 2017 were not filled until after the Co-\nNeutrals’ order of March 5, 2018.   \n SPPU documented in January 2018 that the shelter “continues to struggle with not having \nenough staff to meet the needs of the youth, requiring staff to work numerous doubles in a \nrow.” On March 16, 2018, SPPU documented that two youth were arguing in a cottage and staff \nwished to separate the youth to de-escalate the situation.  However, since there were only two \nstaff assigned to the cottage, staff were unable to separate the youth.  SPPU documented some \nof the consequences of staffing shortages on staff morale, citing that shelter staff report being \n“exhausted,  frustrated  and  unsupported  in  their  work.”  SPPU  also  documented  that  staff \nappear “overwhelmed” and “tired.”      \nIn its investigations, OCA has also repeatedly documented that Laura Dester was understaffed \nand chaotic.  Several investigations reported that supervisors often did not assist direct care \nstaff with supervision of the children and when staff requested assistance from supervisors, \nparticularly when children’s behaviors escalated, supervisors frequently did not respond until \nthe incident was over. OCA reported that staff at Laura Dester was known to work double \nshifts, as long as 16 hours, which inhibited their ability to provide proper care to the children \ndue to fatigue, and caused some staff to become short tempered and inappropriately react to \nthe challenging behaviors of some children. \nDespite repeated warnings from SPPU, OCA, the Governor’s liaison and the Co-Neutrals about \nunsafe conditions for children at Laura Dester, and an increase in referrals of abuse and neglect \nof children at the Center, DHS did not make good faith efforts to address the risks to child \nsafety. From March 2017 thru February 2018, OCA substantiated seven distinct referrals of \nchild maltreatment at Laura Dester involving 10 children in DHS custody.  During the same \nperiod,  DHS  accepted  46  child  maltreatment  referrals  that  were  either  ruled  out  or \nunsubstantiated, and screened out an additional 53 referrals.  \nUnder Section 2.14 of the CSA, the Co-Neutrals are granted the authority to require DHS to \nundertake  and  maintain  diagnostic  and  remedial  activities  when  the  Department  fails  to \nachieve positive trending or begins to trend negatively in any area. In light of the agency’s \nperformance with respect to child maltreatment in care, and grave concerns for child safety at \nLaura Dester, the Co-Neutrals required DHS on March 5, 2018 to cease any new placements at \nLaura Dester. Further, the Co-Neutrals required that DHS develop a transition plan to place all \nchildren out of the shelter by a date to be determined but not later than June 30, 2017.  As \nadditional referrals and substantiations of child abuse and neglect at Laura Dester surfaced \nafter March 5, 2018, the Co-Neutrals filed with U.S. District Court Judge Frizzell a request to \nadopt the Co-Neutrals’ directive as a judgment of the Court, to which DHS objected. Judge \nFrizzell ordered on June 5, 2018, that “the Oklahoma Department of Human Services must, \n95 \n \n\namong other things, relocate the remaining children currently placed at the Laura Dester \nChildren’s Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma to alternate, safe, needs-based placements by June 30, \n2018.” (See Appendix F) \nF.  Caseworker Visitation  \nQuality visits by the same caseworker with the same child is fundamental to achieve stable \nplacements and timely permanency for children, provide opportunities to assess and address \nchildren’s safety and well-being, and support foster parents in their care of foster children. DHS \nreports on two performance areas related to caseworker visits: the frequency of caseworker \nvisits, which is defined as the number of required monthly visits completed with children in \ncare; and, the continuity of visits by the same caseworker. For frequency of visits, DHS reports \non the following: \nMetric 3.1: The percentage of the total minimum number of required monthly \nface-to-face  contacts  that  took  place  during  the  reporting  period  between \ncaseworkers and children in foster care for at least one calendar month during \nthe reporting period.  \nMetric 3.2: The percentage of the total minimum number of required monthly \nface-to-face  contacts  that  took  place  during  the  reporting  period  between \nprimary caseworkers and children in foster care for at least one calendar month \nduring the reporting period. \nRegarding Metric 3.1, DHS reported that caseworkers made 102,032 (97.7 percent) out of \n104,427  required  visits  with  children  during  the  reporting  period  of  January  1,  2017  to \nDecember 31, 2017. DHS started strong with an original baseline performance of 95.5 percent \nof all required visits made. DHS has consistently shown in every report period performance that \nexceeds the Target Outcome of 95 percent for this metric. DHS’ performance this period \nremained the same as last period, which has been the highest performance outcome reported \nduring this reform. \n \n \n \n \n \n96 \n \n\nFigure 22: Metric 3.1 – Frequency of Visits by All Workers  \n99%\n97.1% 97.4% 97.5% 97.7% 97.7% \n96.6% \n97% 96.3%  96.4% \n95.5% 95.7% \n95.0% \n95%\n93%\n91%\n89%\n87%\n \n85%\n \n \n \n      \n      Source: DHS Data \n \nDHS’ consistent, strong performance on Metric 3.1 demonstrates DHS’ commitment to regular \nmonthly visits between children and a caseworker.  The Co-Neutrals conclude that DHS has \nmade  good  faith  efforts  to  achieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  the  Target \nOutcome for Metric 3.1. \nThe  second  indicator,  Metric  3.2,  measures  monthly  required  visits  made  by  primary \ncaseworkers only.  To improve casework practice, DHS committed to end the use of secondary \nworkers across the state by January 2014. During the current report period (January 2017 \nthrough December 2017), DHS reported that primary workers made 96,217 (94.9 percent) of \nthe 101,378 required monthly visits with children in DHS custody.  For monthly visits conducted \nby primary workers only, the baseline for DHS’ performance was 51.2 percent and the final \ntarget of 90 percent for this metric was due on June 30, 2016.   DHS has surpassed the final \ntarget for this metric the last three report periods.   \n \n \n \n97 \n \n\nFigure 23: Metric 3.2 – Frequency of Primary Worker Visits \n100% 92.2%  93.7% 94.6% 94.9% \n89.9%  90.0% \n90%\n82.5% \n80% 74.1%  76.0%  77.2% \n70%\n60%\n51.2% \n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n \n0%  \n \n \n \n    Source: DHS Data \n \nThrough its ongoing, focused work to end the use of secondary workers, DHS has substantially \nshifted case practice by prioritizing the importance of having the same, primary worker meet \nwith the same child each month.  This enhanced practice supports better outcomes for children \nthrough consistent case planning by the same worker to secure a child’s placement stability, \nsafety, and permanency.   The Co-Neutrals conclude that DHS has made good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcome for Metric 3.2. \nPerformance Metrics for Continuity of Visits, Metrics 3.3a and 3.3b \nThe measure the Co-Neutrals use to assess Oklahoma’s progress on continuity of children’s \nvisits  with  the  same  caseworker  was  staged  in  two  phases.    First,  DHS  reported  on  the \ncontinuity of  visits  over  three  months  (Metric 3.3a).39    DHS  is  now  in the  second  phase, \nreporting for the sixth time its performance outcomes on continuity of visits over six months \n(Metric 3.3b).  Metric 3.3b measures the following:   \n \n                                                      \n39 DHS is no longer required to report on Metric 3.3a, which measured three month continuity of visits with the \nsame primary caseworker.  \n98 \n \n\nThe percentage of children in care for at least six consecutive months during the \nreporting period who were visited by the same primary caseworker in each of \nthe most recent six months, or for those children discharged from DHS legal \ncustody during the reporting period, the six months prior to discharge. \nDHS’ performance for this period continued to improve from the baseline that was set at 40.65 \npercent. For this reporting period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, DHS reports that \n8,370 children required at least six consecutive visits.  Of these 8,370 children, 5,238 children \n(62.6 percent) were visited by the same primary worker in their most recent six months in care. \nThis represents a decline from last period when DHS reported performance on this metric at \n63.3 percent, however, DHS remains in close proximity to the final Target Outcome of 65 \npercent and substantially above the starting baseline of 40.65 percent.   \nFigure 24: Metric 3.3b – Continuity of Primary Worker Visits Over Six Months \n70% 65% \n62.90% 63.30% 62.60% \n59.20% \n60%\n52.60% \n49.60% \n50%\n40.65% \n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%  \nBaseline Jun-15 Jan-16 Jun-16 Jan-17 Jun-17 J an-18 Target\nJan 13-  \nJune 14  \nSource: DHS Data \n \nDHS’ substantially improved performance on Metric 3.3b also reflects DHS’ commitment to end \nthe use of secondary workers and to support and retain caseworkers through more manageable \ncaseloads. This strengthens DHS’ efforts to ensure the same caseworkers perform visits each \nmonth with children in DHS custody more often.  The Co-Neutrals find that DHS has made good \nfaith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcome for \ncontinuity of visits over a six-month period. \n \n \n99 \n \n\nG. Placement Stability \nOver the last year, DHS has worked to implement a number of strategies that were developed \nor approved at the beginning of 2017 to strengthen practices impacting placement stability \noutcomes for children in DHS custody. These strategies focused primarily on stabilizing children \nin their first placements, and included increasing the number of children who are placed in \nkinship homes  as their  first  placement  in  care;  improving  supports and  services  to foster \nparents; and conducting ongoing reviews to understand where DHS needs to focus its efforts to \nimprove placement stability.    \nDuring the current period, DHS undertook a number of efforts to improve how these new \npractices are being implemented throughout the state.  As reported in the last Commentary, \nthe Co-Neutrals presented some concerns regarding the level of detail and thoroughness of the \ndepartment’s communications to the field on the expectations for staff to implement the new \nplacement stability practices.  As presented below, the department responded accordingly by \nenhancing  trainings  and  guidance  to  reinforce  accountability  among  staff,  clarifying  the \nprocesses and reporting requirements of the new practices, and reiterating the value and \nimportance  of  these  efforts  to  improve  placement  stability  outcomes.    As  a  result,  DHS \nreported improved outcomes with respect to the implementation of these practices over the \ncurrent  period.  However,  as  DHS  recognizes,  continued  improvements  are  necessary  to \nstrengthen  both  the  consistency  and  quality  of  these  practices  to  reduce  the  number  of \nplacements children in DHS custody experience.   \nPerformance Standards \nThe Co-Neutrals and DHS agreed to use the federal Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System \n(AFCARS) files and definitions for placement moves to measure children’s placement stability. \nThis report reviews performance data for the period October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 for \nMetrics 4.1 a, b and c and Metric 4.2. \nPerformance Outcomes \nFor this report period, DHS’ performance improved marginally in three of the four placement \nstability metrics, while performance declined in the remaining metric, as detailed in Table 8 \nbelow. Metrics 4.1 a, b and c report on the number of children who experience two or fewer \nplacements within different lengths of time in DHS custody (e.g., 0-12 months, 13-24 months, \nover 24 months), while Metric 4.2 reports on the number of children who experience two or \nfewer placements after their first 12 months in care.  \n \n100 \n \n\nTable 8: Placement Stability Baselines, Targets, and Current Performance \n     \nBaseline   Performance  Performance  Performance  Performance \nTarget \nMetric  Oct 2011 - April 2015 -  Oct 2015 -  April 2016 -  Oct 2016 - \n6/30/2016 \nSept 2012  March 2016  Sept 2016  March 2017  Sept 2017 \n     \n4.1(a): percent of children in custody \nwith 2 or fewer placements who are  70.0%  73.1%  75.2%  76.0%  76.6%  88.0% \nin care less than 12 months \n4.1(b): percent of children in custody \nwith 2 or fewer placements who are \n50.0%  54.5%  53.4%  55.5%  58.0%  68.0% \nin care more than 12 months but \nless than 24 months \n 4.1(c): percent of children in custody \nwith 2 or fewer placements who are  23.0%  29.7%  30.6%  30.2%  28.6%  42.0% \nin care at least 24 months \n4.2: percent of children in care more \n74% \nthan 12 months, with 2 or fewer \n(Apr.‘12– 77.8%  77.4%  78.0%  78.4%  88.0% \nplacements after their 12 months in \nMar.‘13) \ncare  \n \nKinship as First Placement \nDHS has made increasing the number of children whose first placement upon removal is in a \nsafe kinship relative or kinship non-relative placement a key objective to improve placement \nstability for children in DHS custody.  If a child welfare system determines that a child must be \nremoved from their birth family, placing the child with relatives or families who are familiar to \nthem is most often in a child’s best interest when such placements are determined to be safe \nand able to meet the child’s needs.  In addition to reducing the unease or trauma that children \ncan experience when placed in an unfamiliar home, DHS’ data analysis shows that children are \nmore stable and experience fewer placement moves and disruptions when placed with kinship \nfamilies.  As such, DHS has made it a priority to increase the number of children placed with \nkinship families as part of its strategies to improve placement stability outcomes for children in \nDHS custody.  \nStarting with a focus on first placements, DHS developed guidance and strategies to enhance \nthe department’s efforts to identify kinship placements early in a case, starting with gathering \npertinent information from any person who calls the statewide Hotline to report suspected \nabuse/neglect and from the beginning of any investigation regarding abuse/neglect allegations \nfor children living with their birth families. The overarching message to staff is that family \n101 \n \n\nengagement must be a priority through every step of the child welfare process and improving \nthis practice will advance placement stability and other outcomes for children.  \nWhile placing children with kinship families has always been a priority, DHS’ placement data \nsuggested  that  the  department  had  missed  many  opportunities  to  make  a  child’s  first \nplacement with an available kinship family, as evidenced from a data analysis completed for \nDHS by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which found that a large number of children were \nplaced in a stable kinship home on their second or third placement after removal, not their first. \nTo ensure that staff, particularly CPS investigators, have sought out and assessed all kinship \nplacement options for children entering state custody, DHS established that in order for a non-\nkinship placement to be approved, a caseworker’s supervisor must document for a district \ndirector’s review and approval all efforts undertaken to identify a viable kinship placement, \nincluding the specific kinship placement options reviewed and ruled out.  The supervisor is \nrequired to document all efforts made to locate a kinship placement on the Non-Kinship District \nDirector Approval form and record these efforts and the district director’s approval in KIDS.40   \nAlthough  the  main  focus  of  increasing  kinship  placements  has  been  on  children’s  first \nplacements, DHS requires a district director’s approval for all non-kinship placements, not only \nthose requested for a first placement.  Currently, DHS has not developed a mechanism to track \nand  report  data  on  how  consistently  caseworkers  complete  Non-Kinship  District  Director \nApproval forms.  Further, it is not clear if district directors are appropriately approving requests \nfor non-kinship placements and if caseworkers are sufficiently documenting their efforts to \nidentify kinship families that can serve as placements.  To ensure this recently established \npractice is being implemented at an increasing rate in the field, DHS should review its records to \nassess where improvement may be needed and what information may be gleaned from the \ncompleted forms to further improve on this practice.   However, DHS’ data for children’s first \nplacement type clearly shows that the department’s efforts to increase first kinship placements \nare achieving the intended result.  As shown in Table 9 below, the percentage of children \nwhose first placement is in a kinship home has improved significantly over the last year.  DHS \nestablished baseline data for kinship first placements during the six-month period of July to \nDecember 2016, with 34.6 percent of children being placed in kinship homes as their first \ncountable placement.  Kinship first placements subsequently increased during the following \ntwo  six-month  periods  to  38.5  percent  (January  to  June  2017)  and  44.6  percent  (July  to \nDecember 2017).   \n                                                      \n40 Before DHS makes a decision to remove and seek custody of a child, the department’s required practice is first to \nhold a child safety meeting (CSM) to assess if there remains any opportunity to maintain the child safely with their \nbirth family with supports and services from DHS and the family’s available support system. If a CSM is held where \na decision is made to remove a child and during the meeting kinship options are reviewed and determined not to \nbe an option at that time, a district director’s approval for a non-kinship placement is not required.   \n102 \n \n\nTable 9: Percent of Children Whose First Countable Placement is a Kinship Home41 \nChildren Removed \nChildren Placed in  during the Month \n% of Kinship as 1st \nMonth  Kinship as 1st  and Entered in \nPlacement \nPlacement  Countable \nPlacement \nBaseline: Jul - Dec 2016  878  2,540  34.6% \nJan-17  122  399  30.6% \nFeb-17  190  443  42.9% \nMar-17  206  517  39.8% \nApr-17  162  432  37.5% \nMay-17  151  397  38.0% \nJun-17  170  410  41.5% \nJan - June 2017  1,001  2,598  38.5% \nJul-17  176  398  44.2% \nAug-17  240  489  49.1% \nSep-17  158  373  42.4% \nOct-17  149  357  41.7% \nNov-17  136  344  39.5% \nDec-17  150  303  49.5% \nJuly - Dec 2017  1,009  2,264  44.6% \nSource: DHS Data \n       \nDuring this period, DHS took a number of steps to support the earlier identification of viable \nkinship placements to ensure children did not, whenever possible, go to non-kinship homes \nwhile waiting for kin to be identified. As discussed in the Co-Neutrals’ previous reports, there \nwas  a  history  at  DHS  of  inconsistent  practices  and  communication  to  the  field  that  lead \ncaseworkers to understand that they could not request an initial assessment of a prospective \nkinship family until the child needing placement was in DHS’ physical and legal custody.  This \ncreated a barrier to kinship as a first placement as DHS started its initial kinship assessment \nprocess too late, such as when a child was in immediate need of a placement. \nIn December 2017, the child welfare director issued a communication to all child welfare staff \nconfirming that staff can and should request that the resource family unit begin assessing \nkinship families identified for possible placement if DHS has determined that a child cannot \nsafely remain in their own home and DHS has initiated the process to request custody of the \n                                                      \n41 Countable placements include foster care, kinship, shelters, TFC, group homes, and tribal homes. Examples of \nplacements that are not countable include inpatient, hospitals, or trial reunification.   \n103 \n \n\nchild.  In the same communication, the director informed all caseworkers that if it appears a \ndetermination could be made at a Child Safety Meeting to remove a child from their own home \nand a kinship family has not yet been identified, the CPS investigative worker should invite the \nlocal  foster  care  recruiter  to observe and  listen  for  possible  kinship options  in  the  event \nremoval is deemed necessary. Further, foster care recruitment staff was instructed to use the \nguidance outlined in the Actively Seeking Kinnections (ASK) process to continue a follow up \nconversation  with  any  family  participating  in  the  Child  Safety  Meeting  to  discuss  further \npossible kinship options for the child. \nEfforts to Stabilize First Placements \nAs discussed in the Co-Neutrals’ last report, DHS  has focused on two specific efforts to help \nstabilize a child’s first placement in a foster home, which includes foster homes of all types.  \nThese are the two-day call and the Initial Meeting.  Following a child’s first placement in care, \nDHS now requires caseworkers to call the foster family within two days of placement as a \nmechanism to help ensure a child’s needs are being met and that the resource family feels \nsupported.  This is referred to as the two-day call.   \nFurther, following a child’s first placement in care, DHS has had a standing requirement that an \nInitial Meeting is held within 10 days after a permanency worker is assigned to a child newly \nplaced in DHS custody.42  The meeting is to include birth parent(s), the foster family, the child’s \npermanency worker, the foster family’s resource worker and the CPS worker, who is also \nresponsible for scheduling and coordinating the meeting.  DHS now includes a requirement that \nduring the Initial Meeting, DHS must develop a child and resource family support plan, which \nincludes any services and/or supports identified as important to ensure stable placements.    \nFor these practices, which DHS identified as core strategies to improve placement stability, the \ndepartment  established  baseline  data  to  assess  how  implementation  of  these  practices \nimproves over time.   For the two-day call, DHS reported a starting baseline for the three-\nmonth period of February to April 2017 (only two months after this practice began) with 13.2 \npercent of the newly required calls completed.  For the last three months of this period \n(October to December 2017), DHS reported that 53 percent (528 out of 1,004) of the two-day \ncalls were documented as complete.  \nFor the same three-month baseline period (February to April 2017), DHS reported that only \n10.5 percent of the required Initial Meetings were completed, which confirmed DHS’ earlier \n                                                      \n42 Previously the requirement was for the initial meeting to be held within seven days after the permanency \nworker is assigned to a child newly placed in custody and during this report period, DHS changed it to within 10 \ndays.  \n104 \n \n\nassessment that these meetings, although a long-time requirement, had not become a common \npractice in the field.  In comparison, from October to December 2017, DHS reported that 53 \npercent of the required Initial Meetings were documented as complete.   While work remains \nfor DHS to further increase implementation of these practices, the department has clearly \nshown progress to  advance  the  strategies  that  it  believes  will  further  improve placement \nstability outcomes.  \nAs  with  other  core  strategies  and  practices  that  DHS  has  implemented  to  improve  child \noutcomes  in  a  performance  area,  implementation  of  the  practice  on  its  own  is  just  one \ncomponent.  Ensuring strong case practice is equally important.  To assess the quality of DHS’ \nInitial Meetings, the Co-Neutrals reviewed the contact notes in KIDS for 50 Initial Meetings \ncompleted during the month of December 2017.  The review focused on documentation of two \nkey areas of Initial Meetings: 1) were the needs of foster parents’ discussed and addressed; \nand, 2) was a visitation schedule established, when appropriate, for the children to have regular \ncontact with their biological parents. \nAlthough the Co-Neutrals found limited documentation in KIDS from the 50 Initial Meeting \ncontact notes reviewed, the records showed that in the majority (28) of the cases there were \nreferences to a discussion about the child’s needs, likes or habits or the foster parents sharing \nthat they were already familiar with the child. In 12 cases, the foster parents indicated that \neverything was going well and there were no unmet needs at that time. In 20 cases there were \nnotes indicating a discussion of the foster parents’ needs was had during the Initial Meeting, \nwith seven of these cases documenting specific supports identified and planned for the foster \nparents. During focus group discussions in the field, caseworkers shared with the Co-Neutrals \nthat foster parents often are not yet aware, understandably, of the supports they may need \nwhen  a  child  is  newly  placed  with  them.    This  is  why  it  is  important  for  DHS’  assigned \npermanency and foster care caseworkers to continuously assess the needs of foster parents to \nsupport placement stability.  DHS has committed to such an ongoing assessment through the \nmonthly and quarterly contacts that resource workers must complete with their assigned foster \nfamilies and the monthly contacts required (at minimum) between permanency caseworkers \nand foster families.  \nDHS identified that ensuring frequent and regular visitation between a child in custody and \ntheir biological parents, when appropriate, is key to help advance not only permanency but also \nplacement stability.  The Co-Neutrals found that in 22 of the 50 initial meeting notes reviewed, \nplans for child-parent visitation were discussed, including frequency and transportation.  In \nseven of 50 cases, child-parent visitation was not discussed, either because the birth parents \nwere not present for the discussion or would not be available for visitation such as when the \nparent(s) is incarcerated. \n105 \n \n\nAs DHS continues to improve the completion rate of these Initial Meetings above 53 percent, \nfocus  must  also  remain  on  improving  the  quality  of  the  discussions  around  identifying, \nconfirming and documenting foster parent and child support needs and visitation plans.  The \nchild welfare director sent a communication to all child welfare staff on December 21, 2017 \nreinforcing the department’s Initial Meeting practice and the need to use the established Initial \nMeeting guide to develop a Child and Family Support Plan and to document the information in \nKIDS. (See Appendix G) DHS must also ensure that all caseworkers required to participate in the \nmeetings are present43 and understand the importance of attending these meetings, as well as \ntheir responsibilities during and following the meetings to support foster parents.  \nFurther, the Co-Neutrals understand DHS’ priority at this time is to focus on firmly establishing \nquality and consistent practices for these two selected placement stability strategies (two-day \ncall and Initial Meeting).  However, these strategies are currently required only for a child’s first \nplacement after removal and not any subsequent family-based placements.  As such, DHS must \nassess how these strategies should be applied to any new family-based placement for a child to \nsupport foster parents in the same or modified way for all new placements, not just the first, in \norder to further advance placement stability.  \nAssessments of Placement Stability \nTo support more stable placements for children in DHS custody, in January 2016, DHS began \nimplementation of the monthly “Two-Moves” tracking report.  The original focus of the report \ncentered on those children who experienced a move from their second to third placement each \nmonth.  For each of the children who experienced a move to their third placement in a given \nmonth,  DHS  required  the  child’s  permanency caseworker  to  document  in  the  Two-Moves \nreport the reason the child was moved, the specific efforts undertaken to prevent the child’s \nplacement move, and the efforts taken to collaborate with the foster family’s resource worker \nto avoid a third placement.  During this period, DHS changed the focus of this report (now \nreferred to as the “One-Move” report) to all children who moved from their first to second \nplacement.     \nThe objective of the One-Move report is two-fold: first, it establishes an accountability process \nby requiring that permanency workers and their supervisors assess if children who moved to \ntheir second placement, as well as their foster families, received the appropriate supports and \nservices to help prevent the first placement move, and second, it focuses workers on ensuring \nthe child’s new placement is prepared for and supported in caring for the child to secure \n                                                      \n43 The Co-Neutrals found that only in eight of the 50 Initial Meeting records reviewed, was it specifically noted that \nall the required caseworkers participated in the Initial Meeting.   \n106 \n \n\nstability in the second placement. DHS reports that the children directly targeted by DHS’ One-\nMove report are those included in the Metrics 4.1a (children in care for less than 12 months \nwho  are  in  their  first  placement)  and  4.2  (children  who  remain  in  their  same  or  “first” \nplacement they were in when they entered their 13th month in care).44   \nThe One-Move report from December 2017, the last month of the current period, showed that \nstatewide a total of 145 children exited their first placement.  As the chart below illustrates, the \nprimary reason children exited their first placement during the month of December was to be \nplaced in a kinship home (27 percent). The other most common reasons for children exiting \ntheir first placements were: foster parents’ request due to personal issues (22 percent) and \nfoster parents’ being unable to work with a child’s behavior (15 percent).   \nTable 10: First Placement Exit Reasons, December 2017 \n# of \nReason Child Moved from 1st Placement  Percentage \nChildren \nPlacement in kinship home  39  27% \nProvider requested due to personal issues  32  22% \nProvider unable to work with child's behavior  22  15% \nPlacement with sibling  21  14% \nPlacement in lower level of care  14  10% \nPending investigation  11  8% \nPlacement closer to family  3  2% \nOther   3  2% \nGrand Total  145  100% \n \nCentral to DHS’ work related to the One-Move report has been reducing the number of children \nwho experience placement disruptions due to foster parents requesting that a child be moved \ndue to behaviors.   To best learn from those cases where children disrupt from placements due \nto  behaviors,  supervisors  call  the  former  foster  parents  of  each  child  who  experienced  a \ndisruption from their first placement to understand from foster parents what specific child \nbehaviors led to the disruption and what actions, if taken by DHS, could have prevented the \ndisruption.   \n                                                      \n44 Metric 4.2 measures the percent of children who experienced two or fewer placement settings after their first \n12 months in care.  Since this metric functions as a re-set for children who during their first year in care \nexperienced more than two placements, DHS included these children in their One-Move report efforts in order to \nwork toward the stabilization of the child’s placement upon entering their 13th month in custody.    \n107 \n \n\nFrom  these  supervisor  calls,  DHS  has  collected  information  from  foster  parents  that,  if \nsystematically addressed, could better support foster families in meeting the needs of children \nwith  behavioral  challenges  and  prevent  placement  disruptions.    For  example,  One-Move \nreports from this report period documented the following actions, reported by foster parents, \nthat, if taken by DHS, might have prevented the placement disruption:   \n(cid:120)  Provide better information about a child’s behaviors and needs prior to placement;  \n(cid:120)  Improve  communication  between  foster  parents  and  caseworkers,  and  between \ndifferent caseworkers in the home;  \n(cid:120)  Place fewer children in foster homes (particularly fewer children two years of age and \nyounger); and, \n(cid:120)  Provide more timely and improved access to services, particularly in rural counties. \nIn other cases, the One-Move reports indicate that no additional actions, if taken by DHS, would \nhave prevented the disruption.  For example, some foster parents reported that caseworkers \ntook all appropriate actions to support the home and child but due to the severity of the child’s \nbehaviors, it was necessary for the child to be moved from the home.  Other foster parents \nreported that they declined caseworkers’ attempts to put services and supports in the home \nand thereby it is unclear what additional actions, if any, caseworkers could have taken to \nprevent the disruption.     \nTo further inform DHS’ efforts to prevent placement disruptions due to child behaviors, each \nregional placement stability lead conducts a case record review of two disruption cases a \nmonth.  These in-depth case record reviews showed both the strengths and weaknesses of \ncaseworkers’ case practice to support foster homes that experienced a placement disruption \ndue to a child’s behaviors.   In particular, the review found that in some cases, caseworkers \nappeared to:  initiate services and supports for children and foster parents; use monthly visits \nto address any needs/concerns of foster parents; and, respond timely to requests made by \nfoster parents.   The review also found that in other instances, caseworkers did not appear to \nprovide adequate support to foster families and children.  For example, some caseworkers did \nnot  consistently  use  monthly  visits  to  assess  and  address  the  needs  of  foster  parents  or \nchildren; services and supports were not timely initiated or offered to foster parents; and, \nfoster parent concerns or requests were not followed up on by caseworkers. \nFor those children who disrupted from their placement due to behaviors, DHS has committed \nto ensuring a child’s second placement receives the appropriate preparation, services and \nsupports to prevent a subsequent placement disruption.  Beginning in December 2017, DHS \ninstructed staff that if a child is moved from their first placement due to behaviors and the \nsecond placement is a kinship or traditional foster home, a Systems of Care (SOC) referral \nshould be made in order to ensure the child’s new placement is adequately supported to care \n108 \n \n\nfor the child and his or her needs.  DHS also sent a notification to all resource parents informing \nthem about SOC services and the department’s intended plans to support them and children \nplaced with them through SOC wraparound services.  DHS reports that through SOC, foster \nparents and children are supported through wraparound services that seek to address the \nneeds of the child and family.   An SOC referral may not be required if a child is already \nreceiving services or a caseworker prefers to establish services through a known and credible \nprovider in the local area where the child is placed.  DHS has revised the One-Move report in \norder to track if these referrals are being made, if appropriate.  \nAs noted in the TFC section of this Commentary, DHS will need to continue to assess with its \npartners at ODMHSAS how best to match foster families and children in custody to these and \nother necessary services to achieve the goals set for improved stability and well-being for the \nchild in custody and their caregivers. \nFocusing on DHS’ priority to increase the number of children whose first placement is in a \nkinship home, DHS has revised its One-Move report to include for those children who are \nmoved from their first placement into a kinship placement the barriers for why this kinship \nplacement was not secured as the child’s first placement.  Some identified barriers documented \nin the One-Move report include: \n(cid:120)  A lack of upfront family identification; \n(cid:120)  Personal issues of a kinship family prevented placement at the time of a child’s removal; \nand, \n(cid:120)  Delays in foster care’s approval of a kinship home.  \nDHS’ records also show that for a number of these children, their first placements were in \nkinship homes; however, due to various reasons, the initial kinship placement was not stable, \nwhich resulted in the child being moved to a second kinship placement.   \nOver this period, DHS has both strengthened and expanded its One-Move report to support its \nefforts to improve placement stability.  Through its One-Move report, DHS is gathering valuable \ninformation  on  the  specific  case  practice  areas  that  need  to  be  strengthened  to  prevent \nchildren from experiencing multiple placements.  Through this reporting structure, DHS is \npositioned to, and must, transfer its findings from the One-Move report to efforts to continue \nto improve children’s placement stability.   \nEnhanced Efforts to Improve Implementation of Core Strategies  \nAs  discussed  in  the  Co-Neutrals’  last  Commentary,  there  were  deficiencies  in  DHS’  initial \nimplementation of its placement stability core strategies.  These deficiencies were evidenced by \nthe findings of the Office of Performance Outcomes and Accountability’s (OPOA) analysis of 48 \n109 \n \n\nin-depth  case  reviews  last  period,  which  showed  that  the  enhanced  placement  stability \npractices were not yet being performed consistently and at a high quality.  In response to these \nfindings, DHS, in August 2017, provided mandatory Guided Application Practice (GAP) trainings \nfor supervisors in each region.  The training focused on how best to support foster parents, the \nimportance of kinship first placements, and the role of supervisors in advancing caseworkers’ \nplacement stability practice. DHS reports that after the completion of the GAP trainings, their \ndata indicated that the occurrence of the enhanced placement stability practices had not \nimproved as hoped.  As a result, DHS identified that an additional training was necessary to \naddress  remaining  barriers  to  caseworkers  completing  as  required  the  new  practices  and \nprotocols, including the two-day call and Initial Meetings.  In November 2017, the placement \nstability  leads  delivered  the  enhanced  placement  stability  training  to  all  regional  deputy \ndirectors, district directors, and field managers.  DHS reported that district directors and field \nmanagers trained all caseworkers by January 2018.   \nIn addition to these efforts, the child welfare director issued two instructional memos to staff in \nNovember  2017  which  contained  a  detailed  overview  of  each  of  the  placement  stability \nstrategies, case practice expectations of each, and the roles and responsibilities of caseworkers \n(Hotline, CPS, and Permanency) to identify and assess potential kinship placements for children \nin DHS custody.  Lastly, to support caseworkers’ real-time tracking of the placement stability \npractices they need to complete for new child removals, DHS developed a new report (yi867b) \nthis period.  The new report runs each night and offers caseworkers a daily tracking tool to \nensure they timely complete each new practice. Once the new practices have been completed \nand  properly  documented,  the  case  no  longer  appears  on  the  report.  This  new  report \nsupplements DHS’ initial tracking report (yi867), which runs on the 20th of each month and is \nused as a management tool to assess DHS’ progress monthly towards increasing the rate of \ncompletion of each of the placement stability practices.  \nSince the beginning of this reform effort, DHS has made some outcome improvements in all \nfour placement stability measures; however, progress has been incremental and not always \nsustained.  For Metric 4.1c, which measures the placement stability for children who have been \nin DHS custody for the longest period of time, DHS reported for the second consecutive period \na decline in performance. The Co-Neutrals acknowledge and appreciate the value of DHS’ \nefforts to achieve stability for children in their first placements. However, for most children \nreviewed  under  4.1c,  these  efforts  cannot  be  applied  as  these  children  have  already \nexperienced one placement move. For these children, who have been in care for an extended \nperiod of time (at least 24 months), DHS must intensify its efforts to ensure this population of \nchildren  achieve  long-term  stability  as  the  department  works  toward  achieving  their \npermanency. \n110 \n \n\nIt is important to highlight that children reviewed under Metric 4.1c are automatically reported \nas non-compliant for this metric if they were previously reported as non-compliant in either \nMetric 4.1a or b, or both, and still remain in care for at least 24 months as the same standard of \ncompliance (children must have two or fewer placements) is applied to all three metrics (4.1a, \nb, c), despite a progressive increase in the length of time children have been care (e.g., 0-12 \nmonths, 13-24 months, over 24 months).  \nThe Co-Neutrals completed a more in depth quantitative review of the children who were \neligible for placement stability measured under Metric 4.1c (i.e., prior to the reporting period, \nthese children had two or fewer placements). The Co-Neutrals identified the percentage of \nchildren who entered Metric 4.1c for this and the previous three report periods who were \neligible  for  placement  stability  compliance  because  they  had  experienced  two  or  fewer \nplacements prior to the entering at least their 24th month in care.  \nAs shown in Table 11 below, for the current period, 4,646 children were reviewed under Metric \n4.1c. At the start of the current period, only 33 percent (1,529) of these 4,646 children in the \ncohort had two or fewer placements and were thereby eligible to be in compliance for the \nmetric should DHS maintain their placement stability during the current period.   The majority \nof these children (3,117 or 67 percent) had already experienced two or more placements prior \nto the start of the period and therefore was already out of compliance on Metric 4.1c. The Co-\nNeutrals’ review found that DHS maintained the placement stability of 87 percent of the 1,529 \nchildren who entered the Metric 4.1c cohort with two or fewer placements. This more detailed \ndata review of Metric 4.1c shows that DHS achieved placement stability for a higher percentage \nof children this period when compared to three periods ago (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016), \nincreasing  from 80 to 87 percent of eligible children maintaining two or fewer placements. DHS \nexperienced a one percent improvement (86 to 87 percent) from the last report period.  This \ncloser review of Metric 4.1c data informed the Co-Neutrals’ determination of its good faith \nfinding on this measure, despite DHS’ performance outcome showing a decline in performance \nfrom last period.  DHS will need to focus on improving performance toward the established \nTarget Outcome which, in part, includes increasing the percentage of children reviewed under \nMetric 4.1c who enter the measure as eligible for compliance.  Placement stability efforts and \nimproved outcomes demonstrated in Metrics 4.1a and 4.1b are key to helping DHS achieve this \ngoal.   \n \n   \n111 \n \n\nTable 11: Measure 4.1 C, Number of Children Eligible, Performance, and Total Cohort45 \nReport Period \nCurrent  Prior  Two-Prior  Three-Prior \nOct 1, 2016  Apr 1, 2016   Oct 1, 2015  Apr 1, 2015 \n4.1 C \nto  to  to  to \nSep 30,   Mar 31,  Sep 30,  Mar 31, \n2017  2017  2016  2016 \nNumber of children eligible for \nnumerator at start of FFY  \n1529  1771  1899  2106 \n(i.e. had 2 or fewer placements \nat start of FFY) \nDHS Performance (Numerator)  1331  1524  1670  1687 \nCohort Total (Denominator)  4646  5060  5492  5681 \nPercent of Children Effected  87%  86%  88%  80% \n \nDHS over the last year has dedicated more focus and attention to establish case practices, \nprimarily focused on children’s first placement in DHS custody, to increase placement stability \nand reported some improvement in the other three placement stability metrics.  The Co-\nNeutrals find that DHS made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress \ntoward the Target Outcomes for all four placement stability measures.   \nH. Permanency  \nIn order to achieve permanency for children in DHS custody, the department has implemented \ncore permanency strategies for children with the goal of reunification; for children who are \nlegally free with a goal of adoption but do not yet have a permanent family identified; for \nchildren who are legally free and have an identified permanent placement and for older legally \nfree youth without an adoption goal at risk of aging out of foster care.  \nAs presented in greater detail below, the Co-Neutrals find that DHS has made good faith efforts \nto achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcomes for 10 of the 11 \npermanency metrics.  The Co-Neutrals have determined that for this report period DHS has not \nmade  good  faith  efforts  to  achieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  the  Target \nOutcome for Metric 6.2a, timely permanency for children within 12 months of entering DHS \ncustody, which is also the sole permanency performance area for which the department has \nnot achieved substantial or sustained progress toward the Target Outcome during this report \nperiod or throughout the entire reform.  \n                                                      \n45 Note that these numbers do not exactly match the numbers in the reports because of different data sources. \n112 \n \n\nTimeliness of Children’s Permanency, Metrics 6.2 (a-d)  \nThe four 6.2 Metrics (a, b, c and d) measure DHS’ progress to achieve timely permanency for \nchildren who entered DHS’ custody at a designated time and who achieved permanency in 12, \n24, 36 or 48 months from the child’s removal from their family. For more than two years, DHS \nhas worked to implement the Permanency Safety Consultation (PSC), its primary core strategy, \nto achieve timely permanency for children, with an emphasis on those children with the goal of \nreunification. DHS’ efforts to implement PSCs are discussed below. \nPermanency Safety Consultation (PSC) to Expedite Reunification  \nPSCs are structured case conferences scheduled to occur at regular intervals and are designed \nto assess through a team approach the viability of a child’s safe reunification with their family. \nPSCs are required to be conducted for every child whose permanency plan is reunification. \nPSCs begin 90-days after a child’s removal from his or her birth family to identify, address and \nmonitor opportunities for safe reunification as well as ongoing concerns preventing a child from \nreturning  to  the  parental  home.  As  part  of  a  PSC,  the  participating  team  records  a \nrecommendation of safe or unsafe, indicating if a pathway for safe reunification has or has not \nbeen identified. When reunification is determined to be possible, a plan of action is developed \nto move the child timely back home with their family, with a follow up PSC occurring every 30 \ndays until the child is placed in trial reunification. For PSCs that conclude with an unsafe finding, \nsubsequent PSCs are required at least every 90 days as long as reunification remains the child’s \npermanency goal. DHS established this schedule for ongoing PSCs for all children with a goal of \nreunification at the conclusion of the last report period. Prior to setting this schedule, DHS \nfocused first on ensuring that all children with a goal of reunification had at least one PSC, \nthrough  phased  implementation  of  the  PSC  practice  throughout  the  state,  while  the \ndepartment  simultaneously  developed  a  Continuous  Quality  Improvement  process  and \nproceeded to implement PSCs statewide by October 2016.   \nThe Co-Neutrals observed in DHS’ PSC data report (Y1838) that the department completed \nbetween July 1 and December 31, 2017 a total of 6,140 PSCs for 4,203 unique children, as some \nchildren received more than one PCS within the period, which is an indicator that the PSC \nprocess has become a central part of DHS’ statewide permanency practice.  As discussed in the \nprevious Co-Neutral Commentary, DHS developed a PSC Guidebook and Fidelity Review Tool to \nsupport staff in building consistent and quality PSC casework practice.  The PSC guidebook \ndescribes the responsibilities and expectations for every DHS staff person who participates in a \nPSC, including the child’s caseworker, the caseworker’s supervisor, the district director, and \npermanency program staff from DHS state office.  The PSC guidebook also provides a detailed \nexplanation of the activities caseworkers must complete and safety questions the worker must \n113 \n \n\nreview to prepare for an effective PSC and support a thorough assessment of any safety \nconcerns that have prevented reunification to date. DHS has also established a leadership \nstructure  and  process  to  conduct  quality  assurance  for  the  PSC  practice.  The  designated \nstatewide PSC coordinator participates in consultations in districts of every region to review the \nquality of the PSC process and, in individual cases, assists staff as needed to assess if safe \nreunification is possible. The PSC coordinator further focuses on the quality of the PSCs by \nconferencing  with  district  directors  before  participating  in  a  PSC  in  their  area  to  discuss \nprogress  and  challenges  with  the  PSC  process,  as  well  as  practice  trends  or  barriers  to \nreunification that have surfaced through the PSCs in their district.  The coordinator further \nconducts  a  debriefing  with  district  directors  and  supervisors  following  a  PSC  session  and \nmaintains a log of issues identified during the pre-calls and debriefings.  The PSC coordinator \nand designated PSC regional leads also confer to review completed PSC tools to determine if \nthere are systemic practice concerns or other barriers DHS may need to address to improve \npermanency outcomes.  \nDHS has implemented statewide the PSC process and practice with attention to ongoing quality \nimprovement.  However, by the end of the report period, the PSC process had not yet shown to \nhave a measurable, positive impact on permanency outcomes achieved for children who have \nbeen in DHS custody within one year of removal as measured under Metric 6.2a.  As the Co-\nNeutrals have previously commented, it is insufficient for DHS to continue to rely primarily on a \nsingular strategy to impact timeliness to permanency, particularly when, over the course of \nnumerous reporting periods, the strategy has not helped the department achieve substantial \nand sustained progress toward the Target Outcome. The Co-Neutrals have repeatedly extended \nthe benefit of the doubt to the department with respect to its efforts to achieve permanency \npursuant to Metric 6.2a, but at some point, progress must be evident and the CSA anticipates \nsome positive trending toward the Target Outcome. The department has maintained that its \nimplementation  of  the PSCs  would  improve  permanency for  the  shortest-staying  children, \nreflected in the Metric 6.2a measurement, and would remain its primary strategic effort.  After \nmore than five years, DHS’ performance on Metric 6.2a remains worse than it was at the \nbeginning  of  this  reform,  and  is  headed  in  the  wrong  direction.  DHS  must  assess  its \nperformance for these children, diagnose the barriers to permanency for short-staying children \nand implement measures to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Metric 6.2a \nTarget Outcome.  \n \n \n \n114 \n \n\nPermanency Outcomes - Timeliness \nThe following summaries and tables detail the baselines, performance to date and targets for \neach of the 6.2 Metrics.   \nMetric  6.2a,  Permanency  within 12  months of  removal:  DHS  reported  that of the  2,512 \nchildren who entered foster care between April 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016, 788 children \nachieved permanency within 12 months of their removal date.  This represents a permanency \nachievement rate of 31.4 percent for Metric 6.2a, which is a decrease of 1.7 percent from the \nprevious period.  The Target Outcome is 55 percent.  DHS has not made substantial or sustained \nprogress  on  this  measure  and  has  not  yet  achieved  during  any  period  of  this  reform \nperformance above the starting baseline of 35 percent.   \nOf the 2,512 children reviewed in this cohort, 598 (24 percent) were reunified, 73 (3 percent) \nwere adopted and 117 (5 percent) achieved permanency through guardianship or custody with \na relative.   \nFigure 25: Metric 6.2a – Permanency within 12 Months of Removal \n60.0%\n55.0% \n50.0%\n40.0%\n35.0% \n33.1% \n31.8%  30.3% 30.6%  31.4% \n30.0% 28.9% 28.2% 27.2% 28.2% \n20.0%\n10.0%\n0.0%\n \n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nIn the sixth Commentary issued in April 2016, for the report period of October 2014 through \nSeptember 2015, the Co-Neutrals found for the first time that DHS had made good faith efforts \n115 \n \n\nto achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcome for Metric 6.2a.   \nDHS’ performance outcome was 28.2 percent, as shown in the Table above.  At that time, this \nrepresented a small, one percent increase from the prior period and performance remained \nbelow the baseline and far from the Target Outcome.  However, despite DHS’ low performance \nfor Metric 6.2a, the Co-Neutrals made a good faith finding based on DHS’ efforts to systemically \nimplement  the  statewide  PSC  process,  which  the  department  reported  was  beginning  to \ncontribute to positive permanency results.   \nThe Co-Neutrals, in the three subsequent reporting periods, determined that DHS’ efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward the 6.2a Target Outcome rose to the level of \ngood faith despite DHS’ performance remaining below the baseline, as performance showed \nmoderate, incremental progress while DHS continued to implement the PSC process statewide. \nThe Co-Neutrals recognized that it would take time for DHS to implement a new statewide \npermanency practice and for the potential impact on permanency outcomes to be evidenced. \nIn each of the three report periods, progress, though modest, toward the Target Outcome was \nevident.   \nIn the current report period, however, DHS did not sustain the progress previously achieved, \nwith performance declining from 33.1 percent in the previous period to 31.4 percent in this \nreport period. In fact, in this report period, not only did performance decline, it remained below \nthe baseline of 35 percent and further from the Target Outcome of 55 percent. \nThe Co-Neutrals continue to recognize the value of PSC as a core strategy to assess the viability \nof timely and safe reunification. However, DHS’ efforts to implement and improve the quality of \nthe PSC process are not adequate to make substantial and sustained progress toward the 6.2a \nTarget Outcome. DHS must also address barriers to timely family reunification, on both an \nindividual case and systemic level, which DHS identified recently in a CQI assessment of 125 \npermanency cases; in recent collaboration with court system partners; and during the many \nPSCs that have been completed over the past several report periods. Some of these challenges \nare described below.   \nChallenges to Timely Reunification \nDHS reports that it has made concerted efforts over the last three years to prevent the removal \nof children from their families. As presented in the Table below, DHS’ data shows a significant \ndecrease in the number of children removed between fiscal year SFY14 with 6,078 removals \nand SFY15 with 5,328 removals.  For the following two years, the number of children DHS \nremoved from their families remained fairly constant with 5,143 removals in SFY16 and 5,158 in \nSFY17.  Between the last two state fiscal years DHS experienced a decrease in removals, going \nfrom 5,158 in SFY17 to 4,639 during SFY18. This reduction has not yet resulted in any significant \n116 \n \n\ndecrease in the number of children reviewed in  Metric 6.2a.  The population of children \nincluded in the denominator for Metric 6.2a increased from 2,340 in the last reporting period \n(April 2016 to March 2017) to 2,512 in the current federal fiscal year report period (October \n2016 to September 2017). For the next reporting period under review for 6.2a (April 2017 to \nMarch 2018), the denominator is 2,375.46 \nTable 12: Total Number of Children Removed During the SFY14-18 \nState Fiscal Year  Total Number of Children Removed \nSFY14  6,078 \nSFY 15  5,328 \nSFY16  5,143 \nSFY17  5,158 \nSFY18  4,639 \n \nDHS reports that it is focusing more on averting the need for removal and addressing identified \nsafety threats through the development of statewide prevention services. These services are \nprovided to families when it is determined that risk factors can be safely addressed while the \nchild remains living at home. DHS reports that prior to the development of these prevention \nservices many more children would have been taken into custody while staff worked to create \nand implement a service plan, after which children could be returned home. Many of those \nchildren, as DHS reports, would have experienced shorter lengths of stay in custody while \nservice plans were developed. Now, however, according to DHS, those children remain at home \nwith prevention services in place. The department indicates that children who now experience \nremoval are those whose parents present with more complex, severe challenges and cannot \nsafely remain home with services. DHS reports that, for these children, it takes longer to \naddress the serious issues their families confront and, as a result, they experience longer \nlengths of stay, having an impact on 6.2a performance.   \nDHS also reports that there have been challenges, at times, to obtain courts’ approval to reunify \nchildren or to place a child in trial reunification when DHS recommends it is safe to do so. To \naddress these issues, DHS initiated in May 2017 a court improvement project (CIP) team in \nthree  jurisdictions  (Adair,  Pottawatomie,  and  Canadian  counties)  to  improve  exits  to \npermanency  within  12  months.    The  teams,  which  include  DHS  supervisors  and  district \ndirectors,  judges,  assistant  district  attorneys,  children’s  attorneys  and  other  community \n                                                      \n46 The data for child removals and the 6.2a denominator referenced here are for state fiscal years and federal \nfiscal years, respectively, and not the exact same time periods.  \n \n117 \n \n\npartners, has begun to review 12 months of permanency data for a cohort of children entering \ncare from October 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018. The teams will track and analyze outcome \ndata from the identified cohort in order to develop action plans to advance timely permanency. \nThe Co-Neutrals will report in future Commentaries on the results of progress made by the CIP \nteam after DHS provides information regarding the results of the data analysis.   \nAs reported in the Co-Neutrals’ last Commentary, DHS conducted during this review period a \nquantitative and qualitative analysis of permanency trends for children in DHS custody through \nan assessment of 125 cases utilizing Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) protocols for the \nperiod of October 2015 through March 2016.  The analysis is based on a more in-depth review \nof permanency related items identified in the Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR) as \nneeding improvements as well as a review of 234 PSCs completed between October 2016 and \nMarch 2017.  DHS analyzed that the “lack of quality engagement with parents and families and \nassessing their needs is a reoccurring theme found throughout the study.”  The study showed \nthat another practice area needing significant improvement is the frequency and quality of \nchild visits with their birth parents. DHS also reported that the PSC feedback process observed \ndeficiencies in these same practice areas related to engagement with a child’s birth family and \nthe  quality  and  frequency  of  child-parent  visits,  both  of  which  are  essential  to  support \nreunification.  \nAs discussed in other areas of this Commentary, DHS developed during calendar year 2017 a \nnew  Supervisory  Framework  designed  to  improve  practice  and  child  outcomes  statewide, \nprimarily in the areas of permanency, maltreatment and placement stability.  The framework, \nwhich DHS tested in three districts this period, sets forth expectations and includes tools for \nsupervisors  to  regularly  and  effectively  assess  and  guide  case  practice  in  the  field.    The \nframework focuses, in part, on the “ongoing assessment of child safety and application of the \nsafety threshold in determining safe reunification based on findings from the PSCs.”   \nThe Co-Neutrals will report in future Commentaries on DHS’s efforts to address challenges \nidentified  above  and  its  work  to  implement  strategies  to  impact  timely  permanency  and \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward the permanency Target Outcome for 6.2a. \nMetric 6.2b, Permanency within two years of removal: DHS reported that of the 1,793 children \nwho entered foster care between April 1, 2015 and September 30, 2015 and stayed in foster \ncare for at least 12 months, 961 children achieved permanency within two years of their \nremoval date.  This represents a permanency achievement rate of 53.6 percent for Metric 6.2b, \nand an increase of 4.6 percent since the last report period.  The starting baseline for this metric \nwas set at 43.9 percent and the target is 75 percent.    \n118 \n \n\nOf the 1,793 reviewed in this cohort, 446 (25 percent) were reunified, 434 (24 percent) were \nadopted and 81 (five percent) achieved permanency through guardianship or custody with a \nrelative.   \nFigure 26: Metric 6.2b – Permanency within 2 years of Removal \n80.0%\n75.0% \n70.0%\n60.0%\n53.6% \n49.0% \n50.0% 45.6% \n43.9%  44.0% \n41.0% \n38.8%  38.6% 38.8% \n40.0% 37.4% \n30.0%\n20.0%\n10.0%\n0.0%  \n \n \n \n \n Source: DHS Data \n \nOver the last two report periods, DHS’ performance for this measure has increased by almost \n10 percent.  Over the last four periods, the percentage of children in the reported 6.2b cohorts \nwho achieved permanency through reunification remained steady between 23 and 25 percent. \nHowever, the percentage of children who were adopted increased from 17 percent two periods \nago to 24 percent this period.47 DHS’ work to achieve timely permanency through adoption, \nwhen  reunification  is  determined  no  longer  viable,  has  allowed  DHS  to  make  substantial \n                                                      \n47  In  the  September  2013  baseline  data  for  this  measure,  22 percent  of  children  in  the  cohort  achieved \npermanency through reunification, which holds fairly constant with the outcomes of 23 to 25 percent of children \nbeing reunified during the last four report periods.  The data also showed 19 percent of children in the baseline \nperiod achieved permanency through adoption, compared to 17 to 24 during the last four report periods, with the \ncurrent period at 24 percent achieving adoption within 12 to 24 months of entering care.  Adoption outcomes \nwithin this measure have shown a significant increase. \n119 \n \n\nprogress over the last three report periods.  For this report period, the Co-Neutrals find that \nDHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the \nTarget Outcome for Metric 6.2b. \nMetric 6.2c, Permanency within three years of removal: DHS reported that of the 989 children \nwho entered foster care between April 1, 2014 and September 30, 2014 and stayed in foster \ncare for at least 24 months, 633 children achieved permanency within three years of their \nremoval date.  This represents a permanency achievement rate of 64 percent for Metric 6.2c \nand an improvement of 8.3 percent since the last report period.  The Target Outcome is 70 \npercent and the baseline for this metric was set at 48.5%. \nAs with the previous measure (Metric 6.2b), DHS’ practice to achieve permanency through \nadoption has improved over the last several periods for the cohort of children reviewed in this \nmeasure, 6.2c. For this metric, permanency was achieved most often through adoption. During \nthis report period, 454 (46 percent) children in the cohort of 989 were adopted and 152 (15 \npercent) were reunified with their families.  In the baseline data for this measure, 33 percent of \nthe cohort children were adopted, which has since significantly increased to 46 percent.   \nFigure 27: Metric 6.2c – Permanency within 3 years of Removal \n80.0%\n70.0% \n70.0% 64.0% \n55.6% 55.7% \n60.0% 53.5% \n50.5% \n48.5% 46.9%  47.5% \n50.0% 43.7% \n37.4% \n40.0%\n30.0%\n20.0%\n10.0%\n0.0%\n \n \n \n \n       Source: DHS Data \n \nAs depicted in the Figure above, DHS has been approaching steadily the established Target \nOutcome for Metric 6.2c.

This represents a permanency achievement rate of \n54.8 percent, and despite a slight decrease of 0.2 percent from the last period when the \ndepartment met the target, DHS remains very close to the Target Outcome set at 55 percent. \nThe Co-Neutrals find that DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained \nprogress toward the Target Outcome.  \nFigure 28: Metric 6.2d – Permanency within 4 years of Removal \n60%\n55.3% 55.0% 54.8% 55.0% \n51.3% \n49.6% \n48.5% \n50% 46.6% \n42.6% \n39.3% \n40%\n32.7% \n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n \n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nChildren’s Re-entry to Foster Care within 12 Months of Exit, Metric 6.3 \nMetric 6.3 measures how well DHS ensures that children who achieve permanency remain with \ntheir permanent families and do not re-enter foster care in a short period of time. Specifically, \nMetric  6.3  measures  re-entry  to  foster  care  within  12  months  of  a  child’s  discharge  to \npermanency (not including adoption) in the 12-month period prior to the reporting period.  \nThe baseline for this metric is 10.3 percent of children re-entering care and the final Target \nOutcome is no more than 8.2 percent of children re-entering care.  For this period, DHS \n121 \n \n\nreported that of the 3,004 children who discharged to permanency (not including adoption) \nbetween October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016, 187 children re-entered care within 12 \nmonths, which represents 6.2 percent of child re-entries, DHS’ best performance to date on the \nmeasure, and progress of 1.1 percent since the last report period. For this report period, DHS \nmet  and  exceeded  the  final  Target  Outcome  of  8.2  percent,  representing  the  second \nconsecutive period that DHS has exceeded the Target Outcome for this measure.  The Co-\nNeutrals find that DHS made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress \nfor Metric 6.3. \nDHS attributes the requirements of PSC practice, including the assessment and documentation \nof safety prior to reunification and the provision of services and supports to families during trial \nreunification, as key efforts leading to improved performance outcomes and reduced child re-\nentries into the state’s custody.  \nFigure 29: Metric 6.3 – Re-entry within 12 Months of Exit \n12%\n10.3% \n10.0% \n10% 9.4% \n8.5%  8.6%  8.4% \n8.1%  8.2% \n7.6% \n8% 7.3% \n6.2% \n6%\n4%\n2%\n \n0%\n \n \n \n     \n              Source: DHS Data \n \n \n \n \n122 \n \n\nTimeliness to Adoption for Children Who Become Legally Free, Metric 6.5 \nMetric 6.5  measures the  timeliness to  adoption  for  children  who became  legally free  for \nadoption in the 12 months prior to the reporting period.  The baseline for this metric was \nestablished at 54.3 percent with the performance target set at 75 percent.  In the current \nreport period, DHS data shows that of the 2,734 children who became legally free between \nOctober 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016, 1,886 (69 percent) were adopted within 12 months \nof becoming legally free. This represents a small positive increase of .4 percent since the last \nreport period, and DHS’ strongest performance during the course of this reform effort.  Further, \nthis is the sixth consecutive period for which DHS has sustained progress toward the Target \nOutcome. \nFigure 30: Metric 6.5 – Permanency Performance \n80% 75.0% \n68.6% 69.0% \n70% 66.5% \n63.3% \n57.2% \n60% 54.3% 55.6% \n51.9% 52.0% \n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n \n0%  \n \n \n \n       \n \n       Source: DHS Data \n \nIt is notable that DHS achieved improved outcomes for Metric 6.5 in every report period at the \nsame time the number of children subject to the metric increased in every report period.   \nTable 13 below shows for each period the underlying number of children (denominator) who \nbecame  legally  free  in  the  12  months  prior  to  the  period  and  the  number  of  children \n(numerator) who achieved permanency through adoption in the 12 months after becoming \nlegally free. \n   \n123 \n \n\nTable 13: Number of Children who became Legally Free Every Report Period under Metric 6.548 \nJan  July  Jan  July  Jan  July  Jan  July  Jan \nMetric 6.5 \n2014  2014  2015  2015  2016  2016  2017  2017  2018 \nNumerator  898  857  839  935  1200  1459  1567  1754  1886 \nDenominator  1474  1540  1618  1797  2099  2304  2355  2558  2734 \nPerformance \n60.9%  55.6%  51.9%  52%  57.2%  63.3%  66.5%  68.6%  69.0% \nOutcome \n \nDHS’ regional Adoption Timeliness Accountability Teams (ATATs) continue to set and track \ntarget dates for adoption finalizations and address barriers that have delayed permanency for \nlegally free children, with a focus on timely permanency for children who have an identified \nadoptive family.   \nFor  the  last  five  report  periods,  DHS  has  been  on  a  steady trajectory toward  the  Target \nOutcome for this measure.  The Co-Neutrals find DHS has made good faith efforts during this \nreport period to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcome for \nMetric 6.5.   \nAdoption Permanency, Metrics 6.6, and 6.7  \nPermanency  Metrics  6.6  and  6.7  measure  how  well  DHS  avoids  pre-adoption  placement \ndisruptions and post-adoption finalization dissolutions.   \nMetric 6.6 measures the percentage of adoption placements that do not disrupt over a 12-\nmonth period, of all new trial adoption placements made during the previous 12-month period. \nThe baseline for this metric was set at 97.1 percent and the Target Outcome was set at 97.3 \npercent. For this reporting period, DHS’ data shows that of the 2,513 children who entered a \ntrial adoption placement between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016, 2,413 children (96 \npercent) did not disrupt from their placements within 12 months of entering trial adoption.  \nIn the prior two report periods, DHS met the Target Outcome for this metric.  However, for this \nperiod, the department reported a decrease of 1.3 percent from the 97.3 percent outcome \nachieved last period.  A total of 100 children disrupted from their trial adoption placement this \nperiod and DHS needed 33 fewer pre-adoption disruptions to maintain performance at the \n                                                      \n48 The column headings contained in this table reflect each semi-annual report date measured for this metric.  The \nsemi-annual report dates listed in the table correspond to the 12-month reporting periods contained in Table 9. \n124 \n \n\nTarget Outcome.  This performance outcome is below the baseline of 97.1 percent, after two \nprevious periods of performance at or above the Target Outcome. \nThe Co-Neutrals reviewed the records of the 100 children whose trial adoptions disrupted \nduring this report period. This review showed that challenging child behaviors identified by \nprospective adoptive parents were the predominant factors that contributed to placement \ndisruptions.  Child behaviors were noted as a factor for 65 of the 100 children whose adoption \ndisrupted. Based on documented notes in the KIDS records for these 65 children, it appeared \nthat for 61 (94 percent) of the children, DHS provided or offered services and supports for the \nchild and/or family as needed in an effort to stabilize and preserve the placement. For 24 \nchildren whose adoption placements disrupted, there were varying levels of concerns noted \nabout the family that appear to have impacted the placement, with the record showing DHS \nattempted in 17 of these child cases to address these concerns, when feasible, in order to \npreserve the placement. For ten children, the records showed that the pre-adoptive families \nrecommended or the record indicated that the child (or children in the case of some sibling \ngroups) should not be placed in a home with other children. For some cases, this was due to the \nchild’s intensified needs that require the full attention of adoptive parents or the ability of a \nchild to be placed safely with other children. However, these children were placed in pre-\nadoptive homes with other children and this appeared to be a contributing factor to the \ndisruption.  \nThe Co-Neutrals will review in future report periods DHS’ efforts to assess and continue to \nprovide supports to prospective adoptive families. It is important to highlight that the number \nof children who are reviewed under this measure has more than doubled since earlier in this \nreform effort.  Three years ago, in the review period of October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, \nthere were 1,239 children whose pre-adoption success was reviewed in this measure (with an \noutcome of 96.4 percent that did not disrupt), which is less than half of the 2,513 children in \npre-adoption reviewed in this report period.   \nDespite the performance downturn in this report period, the Co-Neutrals found evidence in the \ncase file review of 100 children that DHS routinely supported families through the pre-adoption \nplacement process and provided services meant to stabilize placements. DHS has done so even \nas the population of children placed pre-adoptively has increased by 85 percent since the \nbeginning of the reform. That said, the Co-Neutrals urge DHS to closely track and assess any \nbarriers that might prevent improved outcomes in this performance area.  For this report \nperiod, the Co-Neutrals find that DHS made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and \nsustained progress to achieve the Target Outcome for Metric 6.6.  \n \n125 \n \n\nFigure 31: Metric 6.6 – Permanency Performance\n100% 97.1%  96.4%  96.4%  96.5%  95.4%  95.9%  97.7%  97.3%  96.0%  97.3% \n95%\n90%\n85%\n80%\n75%\n70%\n65%  \n \n60%  \nBaseline Jul-14 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul-17  Jan-18 Target\n(Apr 08 -     \nMar 10)       Source: DHS Data \n \nMetric 6.7 measures the percentage of children who achieved permanency through adoption \nover a 24-month period and did not experience adoption dissolution within 24 months of \nadoption finalization.  The baseline for this metric was established at 99.0 percent and the \nTarget Outcome was set to maintain a 99.0 percent performance outcome. For this reporting \nperiod, DHS’ data shows that, of the 3,655 children who were adopted between October 1, \n2013 and September 30, 2015, the adoptions of 3,647 children (99.8 percent) did not dissolve \nwithin 24 months of being adopted.

DHS and the Co-Neutrals established \nthe point-in-time cohort of 292 children who were legally free for adoption and did not have an \nidentified adoptive placement as of January 10, 2014.  The Co-Neutrals established permanency \ntargets for these children and youth as follows:  \n(cid:120)  By June 30, 2016, 90 percent of the 207 children who were ages 12 and under on \nJanuary 10, 2014 will achieve permanency. \n \n(cid:120)  By June 30, 2016, 80 percent of the 85 children who were ages 13 and over on January \n10, 2014 will achieve permanency.  \n \nDHS reported that 167 (80.7 percent) of the 207 children in the younger segment of the cohort \n(ages 12 and under) achieved permanency as of December 31, 2017.  This is an increase of five \nchildren since June 30, 2017 when DHS last reported that 162 children in the cohort had \nachieved permanency.  At the end of the period, 39 children in the younger cohort remained in \nDHS custody. \n \n127 \n \n\nFor the 85 youth in the older group (ages 13 and older), DHS reported that a total of 39 youth \n(45.9 percent) achieved permanency as of December 31, 2017, an increase of two youth since \nJune 30, 2017.    \nTable 14: Metric 6.1 – Permanency Performance \nPermanency  Permanency \nPermanency Metric  Baseline \nTarget by  Achieved as of \n6/30/2016  12/31/2017 \n6.1: Of all legally free  207 children: \n167 children (80.7%) \nchildren not in an adoptive  Age 12 and  90% \nachieved permanency \nplacement on 1/10/14, the  younger \nnumber who have achieved \n85 children: \n39 children (45.9%) \npermanency.   80% \nAge 13 and \nachieved permanency \nolder \n \n \nDHS also reported that as of December 31, 2017, 39 youth (45.9) percent) in the older cohort \nhave aged out of custody without achieving permanency, an increase of three youth since June \n30, 2017, the end of the previous report period.  At the end of this period, seven youth in the \nolder cohort remained in DHS custody. \n \nEfforts to Identify Permanent Families for Children and Youth in the 6.1 Cohort \nA primary strategy DHS has implemented to advance permanency, primarily with a focus on \nadoption, for the children in the 6.1 cohort is to assign an Adoptions Transition Unit (“ATU”) \nworker to help identify and secure a permanent family for children in this cohort, regardless of \nthe child’s permanency goal.  DHS reported that these ATU workers, along with the child’s \npermanency caseworker, review each child’s progress toward permanency, and develop plans \nto identify permanent placements for each child and youth. ATU workers specialize in locating \npermanent homes for children by performing diligent searches to identify family connections \nand by using information gathered from discussions with children and youth to help identify \npotential adoptive or guardianship families.   \nIn order to further support the ATU process and to bring ATU workers closer toward agreed \nupon caseload standards, DHS reported that it allotted during this report period additional full-\ntime ATU positions, which expanded the statewide ATU team to eight supervisor groups with \nfour to six ATU specialists in each Region.  As of June 30, 2017, there were 27 ATU workers \ncarrying  at  least  one  case,  which  increased  to  38  by  December  31,  2017.    Further,  DHS \nhighlighted that this is the first period during which ATU workers were not assigned any non-\nATU related cases, allowing them to focus solely on advancing permanency for children in the \n128 \n \n\n6.1 cohort, as well as all other children who are legally free for adoption and do not yet have an \nidentified adoption placement.   \nThe Co-Neutrals find that DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained \nprogress toward the 6.1 Target Outcomes. \nPermanency for Older Legally-Free Youth, Metric 6.4 \nMetric 6.4 includes a cohort of legally free youth who turned 16 years of age within two years \nbefore the report period and tracks those youth to measure the percentage who exited foster \ncare to permanency, defined as adoption, guardianship or reunification, before the age of 18.  \nThe final Target Outcome for this metric is set only for the percentage of youth who achieve \npermanency.  However,  the  outcomes  for  youth  exiting  care  without  permanency  or  who \nremain  voluntary  in  DHS’  care  after  the  age  of  18  are  also  publicly  reported  to  provide \ntransparency into their overall experience.  DHS’ baseline for this permanency metric was set at \n30.4 percent of youth exiting with a permanent family.  The final target was set at 80 percent by \nJune 30, 2016. \nFor this period, DHS reported that 136 legally free youth turned 16 years of age between \nOctober 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015.  Fifty-nine of these youth, representing 43.4 percent, \nachieved  permanency  as  follows:  41  youth  were  adopted,  13  youth  exited  through \nguardianship, four youth exited through custody with a relative and one youth was reunified.  \nThis is a substantial increase of 12.3 percent from the last period, when performance was at \n31.1 percent, and represents the largest performance increase DHS has reported within one \nperiod for this measure.   \nDuring the previous period, DHS leadership developed a number of strategies to improve the \noutcomes for the youth who are reviewed in this measure and for whom, historically, DHS has \nfaced some of the greatest permanency challenges. Because youth in this cohort are 16 years of \nage or older, limits on time loom large with respect to achieving permanency before youth \nreach the age of 18 and exit DHS custody, and so it is critical that DHS continue to implement \nstrategies to support permanency for these youth.  \nThe strategies DHS has implemented to improve outcomes under this measure focus on both \nreducing the number of children who enter this metric’s cohort and applying additional focus \nand resources to youth in the cohort who are at the greatest risk of aging out.  To reduce the \nnumber of children entering the cohort, DHS has sought to achieve more timely permanency \n(through adoption and guardianship primarily) for legally free youth before they reach the age \nof 16 and to stabilize and maintain youth with their families, when safely possible, as older \nyouth  sometimes  have  higher  protective  capacities  and  can  remain  in  their  homes  with \nsupports and services.  \n129 \n \n\nFor children who enter the cohort, DHS developed a caseworker position type, Permanency \nExpeditor  (PE),  who  is  assigned  to  youth  with  a  permanency  case  plan  goal  of  planned \nalternative permanent placement (PAPP). PEs provide added support to the child’s permanency \nworker to identify and advance all remaining opportunities to achieve permanency before the \nyouth ages out of care. DHS decided to implement this permanency specialist position, as some \ncaseworkers found it challenging to engage and communicate effectively with some youth who \nrequest  a  PAPP  goal  and  struggled  to  support  youth  toward  achieving  stability  and  legal \npermanency with a family.  \nAs reported in past Commentaries, the majority of youth reviewed in the 6.4 measure during \nprior report periods had a PAPP goal, not a goal of adoption, guardianship or reunification.  For \nthese youth DHS no longer made concerted efforts to achieve permanency and focused instead \non preparing the youth to age out of DHS custody and for independent living. For example, in \nthe 6.4 Metric review period of October 2015 to September 2016, 81 of the 123 youth (66 \npercent) in the cohort had a PAPP case plan goal and 78 (96 percent) of the 81 youth with a \nPAPP goal aged out of foster care without a permanent family during that timeframe. For this \nreport period, October 2016 to September 2017, 67 (49 percent) of the 136 children in the 6.4 \nmeasure cohort were reported to have a PAPP goal, and 61 of these 67 children aged out.   \nTwo important changes positively impacted the reduction of youth assigned a PAPP goal from \n81 (review period September 2015 to October 2016) to 67 for the current review period. First, a \nnew federal law went into effect in September 2015, which no longer allows child welfare \nsystems to establish PAPP as the case plan goal for children ages birth to 15.49  Second, during \nthis period, DHS leadership communicated to staff new requirements to change a child’s case \nplan goal to PAPP, including the pre-condition that supervisors approve the change only after \nthe child’s caseworker has explored and documented that all other permanency options have \nbeen determined not to be feasible or in the child’s best interest. (See Appendix H)  Further, \nstaff must identify a sufficient number of permanent connections upon whom the child can \ndepend after aging out of DHS custody. When a youth is assigned a PAPP goal, DHS now assigns \na PE to continue final efforts, working with the child and permanency worker, to achieve \npermanency.  \n   \n                                                      \n49 P.L. 113-183, Section 112(a), signed Sept 29, 2014. \n130 \n \n\nFigure 33: Metric 6.4 – Permanency Performance \n90%\n80.0% \n80%\n70%\n60%\n50% 43.4% \n40%\n30.4%  31.1% \n30% 26.9% 25.0% 25.3% 26.2% 27.6% 28.5% \n20%\n10%\n \n0%  \nBaseline Jul-14 Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul -17 Jan-18 Target\n(Jul 09 -  \nJun 10)      Source: DHS Data \n \nAs shown in Figure 33 above, DHS’ performance for this metric remained below the starting \nbaseline until the last report period when DHS’ performance exceeded the baseline of 30.4 \npercent.

In addition to showing what is working in our system, CQI processes that involve the routine \nreview and analyses of data draw attention to unexpected changes in trend lines and alert leadership to \nthe need for focused attention. \nFor the first time since June of 2016, a review of data shows that our overall workload has surpassed \nour overall workforce capacity.  Over the last several years, we have focused heavily on stabilizing our \nworkloads by ensuring adequate resources are allocated based on where the workload need is located.  \nWe make adjustments as the workload shifts.  The data shows that our most recent shift in need is due \nto the increase in the CPS workload resulting from a spike in referrals assigned for investigation with a \nsimultaneous net decrease in number of caseload carrying staff.   \nAn increase in the number of overdue investigations and assessments combined with an increase in the \noverall number pending, is an indication that if we do not make adjustments quickly, we will lose the \nworkforce stability we’ve diligently worked to achieve.  Therefore, in addition to expediting \nrecruitment, hiring, and onboarding efforts to ensure the right number of staff are in place, immediate \nadjustments in workload distribution are required to stabilize the workforce.   \nThe following action steps will be implemented beginning immediately.  Some strategies are ongoing, \nand some are temporary strategies that will be utilized only to fill a gap while other efforts begin to \ntake hold. \n1.  Immediate Workload Adjustments \nStarting October 30, 2017, the following temporary adjustments in workload calculations can be \nutilized. These changes will be in effect for 90 days only.   \nA.   Graduated Workloads: \nThe purpose of assigning graduated workloads is to avoid overwhelming new staff and to \nprovide them opportunities for coaching and training before they receive a full caseload so that \nthey can acquire and practice the necessary skills.  This strategy is intended to positively impact \nturnover of staff within their first year of employment.  It has, and we must be careful not to \nreduce that impact.  However, feedback from the field indicates that minor adjustments could \npreserve the impact while increasing our ability to equalize distribution of workload.  \n(cid:190)  Previous methodology (based on length of employment): \no  3 months (approximately) = 25% workload \no  6 months = 50% workload \no  9 months = 100% workload \n(cid:190)  New (temporary) methodology (*): \n142 \n \n\n \no  3 months (approximately) = 50% workload \no  6 months = 75% workload \no  9 months = 100% workload \n(*Careful consideration should be given to the skill level and development of individual staff \nmembers.) \nB.  Workload Standard: \nWorkload standards were adopted to ensure staff have manageable workloads, so that they \nhave adequate time to devote to engaging families to ensure safety, permanency, and well-\nbeing of children served.   Further, establishing a workload methodology allows for leadership to \nallocate resources based on workload need.    \n(cid:190)  Current methodology:  \no  Staff “meet standards” when their workload is 100% of the standard or \nless \no  Staff “almost meet standards” when their workload is greater than 100% \nof the standard but less than 120% \no  Staff “do not meet standards” when their workload is greater than 120% \nof the standard.  \n(cid:190)  New (temporary)  methodology (*) for CPS and PP  in approved districts:   \no  All staff who are not eligible for a graduated workload may carry a \nworkload up to 120% of the standard. (For a permanency planning \nworker, this could be up to 18 children.  For a CPS worker, this could be up \nto 14 investigations.) \no  No staff member will carry a workload greater than 200% of the standard \nat any given time. \n \n(*Careful consideration should be given to the skill level and development of individual staff \nmembers.) \nAny district currently at less than 100% capacity in comparison to overall workload is approved to \nutilize the new temporary workload methodology.   As of 10/30/17, those districts are 4, 6, 7, 8, \n10, 14, 20, 21, 25, 26, and 27.  \nWe will continue to monitor the data, to determine whether the increase in CPS workload is a \ntemporary spike or a new trend.  This information will be utilized to make long term decisions \nregarding the allocation of resources. \n2.  Conduct turnover analyses to understand the uptick and turnover this SFY.  The analyses will be \nused to provide focused attention to targeted districts using the “target district” model we’ve used \nin the past. \n143 \n \n\n \n3.  Update workload analyses to reflect the increase in CPS workload.  This will inform decisions related \nto staffing distribution. \n4.  Implement training and quality assurance plan at the Hotline to ensure appropriate screening \ndecisions are occurring. \n5.  Utilize overtime plans in districts with highest number of investigations and assessments in backlog \nstatus. \nWe are interested in hearing feedback from you and your staff throughout the process of implementing \nthese temporary adjustments.  We need to understand what’s working and what’s not working related \nto these changes.  Therefore, we have created the following email address for staff to send feedback to:   \ncws.workload.feedback@okdhs.org.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n144 \n \n\n \nAppendix D: Statewide Workload and Hiring Plan \nWorkloads Compliance \nAs DHS closes in on its workload compliance goal of 90% of all caseload carrying staff will be \nmeeting standards by December 31st, 2018 and move past the 70% range which has been a place that DHS \nhas flattened out.

CW has noticed that there are two large \npockets of districts that all need help in getting positions on board. Those pockets are district 6, 20, and 21 \nbeing the first pocket and districts 8,10, and 14 making the second pocket. CW will need to work with HR to \nform an aggressive strategy to increase the number of applicants and therefor hires in those districts. The \nreality of the situation is that some districts will not be able to hire the number of staff needed while other \ndistricts will reduce the number of staff that is needed through the reduction of turnover and workloads \nbut retain staff to put their capacity well above the total workload. Finding a way to leverage extra capacity \nin some districts to cover the capacity deficit in others will be paramount to having 90% of workers meeting \nthe standard by December 31st.    \n \n \n \n147 \n \n\n \nAppendix E: Quality Worker Visits - Guidance and Tools \n \nQuality Worker Visits (Children) \n \nDefinition: Quality contacts are purposeful interactions between caseworkers and children, youth, parents, \nand resource parents that reflect engagement and contribute to assessment and case planning processes \nby ensuring child safety, supporting permanency planning, and promoting child and family well-being.  \n \nImpact of Quality Contacts:  \n(cid:120)  Improved assessments of safety, risk, and needs \n(cid:120)  Joint development in case plans \n(cid:120)  Shared understandings of progress toward goals, strengths, and needs \n(cid:120)  Improved family and youth engagement and empowerment  \nKey Phases: \nBefore: Planning and Preparation \nDuring: Engagement, Assessment, Exploration, and Adjustment \nAfter: Documentation, debriefing, and follow-up \n \nBefore:  \n(cid:120)  Plan for length and location of visit to support honest conversations \n(cid:120)  Contact all service providers and medical providers for the child and review most recent service \nprovider report.

If applicable, is the placement Indian Child Welfare \nAct (ICWA) compliant?  If not, what ongoing efforts are being made to place with kin \nor in an ICWA-compliant placement? \n(cid:57)  Has a diligent search been completed and letters sent to identified relatives as stated \nin policy? \n(cid:57)  Are there siblings and if so, are they placed together?  If not, is the quality and \nconsistency of visitation meeting the children's needs? \n(cid:57)  Is there any reason to believe that this placement may not be able to continue to \nmeet this child's needs?  If so, what is being done to support the child and placement \nprovider? \n(cid:57)  What  services  is  the  child  receiving,  such  as  physical  health,  counseling, \nIndividualized Education Program (IEP), developmental disability (DD) services, or \ntutoring? \n(cid:57)  Are the services currently in place meeting all the identified needs? \n(cid:57)  Does the specialist have any concerns with the child's placement?  \n151 \n \n\n \n \n2.  Review Visitation between the Child and Parent(s) \n(cid:57)  What is the frequency and duration of the parent/child visits?

If visits are currently supervised, what safety \ncondition needs to occur to move to unsupervised visitation? \n \n3.  Review of Specialists Contact with PRFC(s) Case Assessment and Progress \n(cid:57)  How does the specialist describe the family's involvement in case planning? \n(cid:57)  Can the specialist give specific examples of how he or she made efforts to improve \nfamily involvement? \n(cid:57)  Based on the underlying causes, what services has the parent(s) been referred to? \n(cid:57)  Can the specialist describe how the individualized service plan (ISP) is behaviorally \nbased?  How is it addressing the safety threats? \n(cid:57)  What services are the parent(s) engaged in?  Can the specialist relay what the \nparent's service providers report as barriers to child safety? \n(cid:57)  Can  the  parent(s)  articulate  what  he  or  she  thinks  has  changed  in  his  or  her \nbehaviors and the family home since the child was removed? \n(cid:57)  Does the specialist have contact with the parent(s)/PRFC(s) in the home at least \nonce a month?  If not, discuss the barriers to monthly contact and relate back to \ncontinually assessing a parent's progress and safety.  An ongoing assessment of \nchild safety requires monthly contact with the PRFC(s). \n(cid:57)  What is the specialist's assessment of the PRFC's current behaviors and protective \ncapacities?  How is he or she gathering information from ongoing collaterals - service \nproviders, friends, family, and foster parents; the child(ren); and the PRFC to make \nthis assessment? \n(cid:57)  Is the current permanency goal appropriate for the case circumstances?  If not, have \na discussion around changing the goal. \nPractice Note:  Potential reasons for changing case plan goal. \n(cid:120)  The case plan goal is reunification, but the child has been in out-of-home care for more \nthan 12 months. \n(cid:120)  90-calendar days since adjudication and the parent(s) is making minimal behavioral \nchanges. \n152 \n \n\n \n \n4.

How has this impacted the current case progress? \n(cid:57)  What underlying causes were identified that contribute to the safety threats? \n(cid:57)  Can the specialist compare, contrast, and discuss the original safety threats to the \ncurrent safety threats. \n(cid:57)  What steps has the specialist taken to support the family in understanding the safety \nthreats and conditions that need to occur to reunify? \n(cid:57)  Does  the  specialist  believe  the  PRFC  understands  what  led  to  the  child  being \nunsafe?    If  not,  discuss  with  the  specialist  what  can  be  done  to  help  them \nunderstand.  If the PRFC does not understand why there was a safety intervention he \nor she will struggle with understanding what his or her role is in correcting it. \n \n5.  Do any of these safety threats currently apply to the family’s circumstances? \n  Living arrangements seriously endanger a child's physical health. \n  PRFC(s) in the home lack the knowledge, skills, motivation, or abilities to perform \nparental duties and responsibilities. \n  PRFC(s) intend(ed) to hurt the child. \n  PRFC(s) does not have resources to meet basic needs. \n  Child has exceptional needs which the PRFC(s) cannot or will not meet. \n  Child is extremely fearful of the home situation. \n  PRFC(s) is violent and/or is unwilling or unable to control the violence. \n  PRFC(s) cannot or will not control behavior. \n  PRFC(s) has extremely unrealistic expectations or extremely negative perception of \nthe child. \n \n(cid:57)  If yes, how does the threat meet the safety threshold of: specific; severe; observable; \noccurring  now  or  likely  to  occur  within  the  next  few  days;  out-of-control;  and \napplicable to a vulnerable child? \n(cid:57)  What  do  ongoing  collaterals,  service  providers,  original  collaterals,  and  family \nmembers, report the PRFC’s current functioning and protective capacities to be? If \nthe case is more than six months old and an active safety threats still exists, discuss \nwith the specialist concurrent planning and the steps needed to ensure safe and \ntimely permanency. \n \n153 \n \n\n \nSupervisory  Feedback:    In  this  section,  the  supervisor  coaches  the  specialist  and  provides \nfeedback  to  identify  barriers  to  achieving  timely  permanency  for  this  case.

No. 871, pp. 5-6] is adopted in its entirety, attached hereto, and \nentered as a judgment of this Court. Pursuant to the March 5 decision, the Oklahoma Department \n158 \n \n\n \nof Human Services must, among other things, relocate the remaining children currently placed at \nthe Laura Dester Children’s Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma to alternate, safe, needs-based placements \nby June 30, 2018. \nENTERED this 5th day of June, 2018. \n \n \n159 \n \n\n \nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHMDocument 8&3ffi Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/05/18  Page 2 of 3 \nMarch 5, 2018 \nEd Lake \nDirector \nOklahoma Department of Human \nServices Sequoyah Building \n2400 N. Lincoln \nOklahoma City, OK \nVia Electronic Transmission \n \n \nDear Director Lake: \n \nDuring the last 12 months (March 2017 thru February 2018), DHS substantiated \nseven  distinct  referrals  of  child  maltreatment  at  the  Laura  Dester  shelter \ninvolving 10 children in DHS's child welfare custody . During the same period, \nDHS accepted for investigation 46 child maltreatment referrals that were either \nruled  out  or  unsubstantiated,  and  screened  out  an  additional  53  referrals. \nCurrently, there are five open investigations involving the treatment of children at \nthe Laura Dester shelter. We are deeply concerned that DHS has not established \na safe environment for the children who are placed in this state-operated facility. \nOver the same 12-month period, DHS steadily increased the number of children \n(many with complex needs) placed at the shelter, often without establishing the \nnecessary  resources  and  organizational  oversight  and  planning  required  to \nensure  these  children  receive  the  therapeutic  care  they  need  to  live  in  a \nreasonably safe environment. \n \nAs DHS is aware, the Co-Neutrals have raised concerns regarding the lack of quality \ncare and safety for the children placed at the Laura Dester shelter over the most \nrecent 12 months, and well before then. In response to concerns discussed in March \n2017, when  DHS had approximately 25 children placed in the shelter, DHS reported \nthat it would hire nine additional staff to improve  the child-to-staff ratio  and bring on \nspecialized individuals to meet the specialized needs of the children placed in the \nfacility. The Co-Neutrals conducted a site visit to the Laura Dester shelter in August \n2017, and observed multiple safety issues and continuing staffing problems, which \nthe Co-Neutrals reported to the Department. \n \nAfter the Co-Neutrals found that ongoing and grave concerns for child safety at the \nshelter persisted, DHS in September 2017 developed a Continuous Improvement \n160 \n \n\n \nModel Plan that included heightened monitoring by DHS' SPPU team and the  \nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM Document 8&3ffi Filed in USDC ND/OK on 06/05/18  Page 3 of 3 \n \nassignment of a full time SPPU liaison dedicated to monitoring the Laura Dester \nshelter. DHS also, again, committed to hire additional staff. \n \nCurrently, there are 44 children placed at the Laura Dester shelter. Despite DHS' \npast  or  ongoing  plans,  the  Laura  Dester  shelter  continues  to  present  an \nunreasonable risk of harm to children placed there. This is evidenced by the \nongoing  and  alarmingly  high  number  of  child  maltreatment  referrals, \ninvestigations  and  substantiations  of  maltreatment  of  children  placed  at  the \nshelter, and the monitoring notes of the SPPU liaison, which cite a wide range of \nserious concerns, many of which have also been observed directly by the Co-\nNeutral team. The Department's diagnostic and remedial actions over the last \nyear have not adequately improved the safety of children in the facility. \nUnder  Section  2.14  of  the  Compromise  and  Settlement  Agreement,  the  Co-\nNeutrals  are  granted  the  authority  to  require  OHS  to  undertake  and  maintain \ndiagnostic and remedial activities when the Department fails to achieve positive \ntrending or begins to trend negatively in any area. In light of the negative trending \nDHS  is  showing  with  respect  to  the  maltreatment  of  children  in  care  and  the \nnumber of children placed in shelters, particularly children ages six and older, the \nCo-Neutrals require DHS to cease immediately any new placements at the Laura \nDester shelter. \n \nFurther,  the  Co-Neutrals  require  that  DHS  develop  and  submit  to  the  Co-\nNeutrals a transition plan by April 1, 2018, to place all children out of the Laura \nDester shelter by a date to be determined but not later than June 30, 2018. \n \nSincerely, \n \nEileen Crummy, Kathleen Noonan and Kevin M. Ryan\n161 \n \n\n \nAppendix G: Placement Stability Communication \nAll  \nChild Welfare Services strongly believes in the practice surrounding Initial Meetings (IMs) \nand the positive impact they have on placement stability for children placed in out-of-home \ncare. Therefore, it is imperative that the information gathered through the attached initial \nmeeting guide that is used to develop a Child and Family Support Plan for the child’s \nplacement is documented in the KIDS contact. This allows the team to easily assess, review, \nand update the Child and Resource Family Support Plan on an ongoing basis. \nThe intended purpose of the Child and Resource Family Support Plan is to include the \nspecific supports, services and/or other tools identified by the CPS, PP and Resource \nSpecialists, Biological and Resource Parents, and Child(ren) that best support the safety, \nwell-being and stability of the child in his or her resource home. A few examples of what \nsupports or services could be in the Child and Family Support Plan, include, but are not \nlimited to respite care, transportation, visitation, specific ways a child is best comforted, \nchild’s likes or dislikes, and contact information for a local resource parent support group.    \nIt is the expectation that the permanency planning specialist documents the completion of \nthe IM within 5 business days and the contact screen provides detailed information from \nthe IM.  \n The body of the contact must include: \n(cid:120)  Efforts made to ensure all parties attended IM \n(cid:120)  Details from the initial meeting guide about the child(ren) \n(cid:120)  Details from the initial meeting guide about the Child and Resource Family Support \nPlan. \n(cid:120)  Identification of staff responsible for implementing the Child and Resource Family \nSupport Plan. \nPlease refer questions to [Name Deleted] or to your regional placement stability lead. \nThank you \n \nJami Ledoux, MSW \nChild Welfare Services Director \n \n162 \n \n\n \nAppendix H: Memorandum from child welfare director regarding Permanency Plan Selection \n \nTO:  CW Supervisors, District Directors, Deputy Directors, and Program Staff \nFROM:  Jami Ledoux, Director Child Welfare Services (CWS) \nDATE:    December 21, 2017 \nRE: Permanency Plan Selection \n \nTo clarify expectations in the selection of a child's permanency plan, revisions will be made to \nOklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 340:75-6-31.  Permanency planning for the child in \nOklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) custody. In the interim, this memo outlines \nspecific requirements that are effective immediately. \nThe permanency plan indicates the intended or desired outcome for each child and influences \nthe services and interventions used to achieve the outcome. The permanency plan must be \nconsistent with each child's legal status and in the child's best interests. Permanency plan \noptions are: \n(1) reunite the child with the child's parent or legal guardian; \n(2) terminate parental rights and place the child for adoption; \n(3) establish guardianship; or \n(4) planned alternative permanent placement (PAPP), provided the child is 16 years \nof age or older, and there is a compelling reason for the court to determine that \nreturning home, or placement of the child for adoption or guardianship is not in the \nchild's best interests. \n \nThe PAPP goal often results in the child aging out of care, which is the least desirable \npermanency  plan.  Research  indicates  children  who  age  out  of  care  are  more  likely  to \nexperience: \n•  unemployment; \n•  living at or below poverty level; \n•  serious untreated health conditions; \n•  a crime as a victim or involvement in a criminal activity; \n•  post-traumatic stress; or \n•  homelessness. \n \nTo improve outcomes for children in OHS custody, additional efforts are required before \nPAPP is selected for a child 16 years of age or older. The child welfare (CW) supervisor must \nensure these requirements are met and documented prior to considering PAPP as the \npermanency plan.  These additional requirements are effective immediately. \n•  Must explore and document all other permanency plan options determined as not \nfeasible or in the child's best interests. \n163 \n \n\n \n•  Identify a sufficient number of permanent connections the child can depend on after \nexiting care. Best practice is to identify at least six to 1O connections. \n•  Hold a family meeting (FM) with the child, all identified permanent connections, CW \nspecialist, CW supervisor, and regional permanency expediter (PE) to discuss and \nagree upon the permanency plan that is in the child's best interests. The FM report \nmust include a detailed description of how and why all other permanency options \nwere ruled out and what ongoing steps will be taken to achieve permanency for the \nchild. \n•  Ensure  the  child  is  actively  engaging  and  participating  in  Oklahoma  Successful \nAdulthood (OKSA) services. \n•  Assign the PE secondary assignment to the child when the child's goal is changed to \nPAPP. \nIf you have any questions, please contact any Permanency Planning Programs staff. \n \n \nJami Ledoux, Director \nChild Welfare Services \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n164 \n \n\n \nGlossary 1: Acronyms \nATAT    Adoption Timeliness Accountability Team \nCANH    Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline \nCAP    Corrective Action Plan \nCHBS    Comprehensive Home-Based Services \nCPS    Child Protective Services \nCQI    Department of Human Services Continuous Quality Improvement  \nCSA    Compromise and Settlement Agreement \nCWS51   Child Welfare Specialist \nDDS    Developmental Disabilities Services \nDHS     Oklahoma Department of Human Services \nFAS    Facility Action Step \nFFY    Federal Fiscal Year \nFSP    Facility Services Plan   \nITS    Instructions to Staff  \nLD    Laura Dester Shelter (state-operated) \nMIC    Maltreatment in Care \nMST    Mobile Stabilization Team \nNCANDS  National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \nOAYS    Oklahoma Association of Youth Services \nOCA    Department of Human Services Office of Client Advocacy \nODMHSA  Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse \n                                                      \n51 CWS additionally is the acronym for Child Welfare Services – the agency within DHS that is charged with \nimproving the safety, permanence and well-being of children and families involved in the Child Welfare system. \n165 \n \n\n \nOHCA    Oklahoma Health Care Authority  \nPEM     Pauline E.

Therein, \nthe Department seeks approval of the Co-Neutral Twenty-Second Commentary, dated January of \n2025 and titled “Final Report,” pursuant to the Compromise and Settlement Agreement entered in \nthis matter.   \nBy way of background, on February 13, 2008, the named plaintiffs—nine children in foster \ncare—on behalf of themselves and more than ten thousand similarly-situated Oklahoma children, \nfiled  suit  seeking  class  certification  and  a  permanent  injunction  enjoining  defendants  from \nsubjecting plaintiff children to practices that violate their constitutional rights, among other relief.  \n[Doc. 2].  This court certified a class of plaintiffs more specifically described as follows:  \nAll children who are or will be in the legal custody of the Oklahoma Department \nof Human Services (1) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect, or (2) who \nare or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.   \n \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-fhm     Document 917 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/13/25     Page 2 of\n5\n[Doc. 272].  The Plaintiff Class and the Oklahoma Department of Human Services subsequently \nreached a Compromise and Settlement Agreement, which this court approved by virtue of an Order \nand Judgment dated February 29, 2012.  [Doc. 778; Doc. 779].   \n  Pursuant to the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, Kathleen G. Noonan, Kevin M. \nRyan, and Eileen Crummy were appointed as “Co-Neutrals,” who were charged with, twice \nannually,  providing  commentary  as  to  the  Department’s  overall  progress  and  whether  the \nDepartment was making good faith efforts pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  [Doc. 770-1, \npp. 5 and 11].  To that end, the Co-Neutrals and Department established the Metrics, Baselines, \nand Targets Plan for various performance areas.   \nThe Settlement Agreement provided that, on December 15, 2016, the Co-Neutrals should \nissue a final report, to include a finding that the Department has, or has not, made good faith efforts \nto achieve substantial and sustained progress toward Target Outcomes.  [Doc. 770-1, pp. 11-12].  \nIn the final report,  \n[i]f the Co-Neutrals find that the Department has made, for a continuous period of \nat least two years prior to December 15, 2016, good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  each  Target  Outcome,  then  the \nDepartment’s obligations under th[e] Settlement Agreement shall terminate and the \nparties shall jointly seek to vacate any Judgment entered by the Court as a result of \na finding or decision by the Co-Neutrals.  \n \n[Doc. 770-1, p. 12].   \n  On September 2, 2016, the parties agreed to amend the Compromise and Settlement \nAgreement to suspend the Co-Neutrals’ issuance of a final report.  Instead, the amendment \npermitted the Department to request a Final Report from the Co-Neutrals at any time.    \nOn December 14, 2021, the court granted the parties’ Joint Motion to Modify Settlement \nAgreement as set forth in the Agreement to Amend the Compromise and Settlement Agreement \nand Partially Suspend Good Faith Reporting on Selected Performance Area Measures, referred to \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-fhm     Document 917 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/13/25     Page 3 of\n5\nas the COVID Recovery Agreement.  [Doc. 908-1; Doc. 909].  Under the COVID Recovery \nAgreement, the parties agreed to hold in abeyance during the “COVID Recovery Period”1 the \ntwice annual determinations by the Co-Neutral as to whether DHS had engaged in good faith \nefforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress for seven performance area measures, known \nas the “Delayed Performance Area Measures.”  All other performance area measures were referred \nto as the “Non-Impacted Performance Area Measures.”   \nOn  March  22,  2023,  the  Co-Neutrals  issued  the  Nineteenth  Commentary,  the  first \nCommentary  following  the  COVID  Recovery  Period.    With  respect  to  the  Non-Impacted \nPerformance Areas, the Co-Neutrals found that the Department had fulfilled the Compromise and \nSettlement  Agreement’s  requirement  for  a  two-year  continuous  period  of  good  faith \ndeterminations.  Accordingly, on April 24, 2023, the court entered an Order concluding that the \nDepartment’s obligations under the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, as amended, with \nrespect to the twenty-three “Non-Impacted Performance Areas Measures” were terminated.  [Doc. \n910].  \nOn February 11, 2025, the Co-Neutrals issued the Twenty-Second Commentary, which \nwas designated as the “Final Report.”  Therein, the Co-Neutrals found that the Department has \nfulfilled the Compromise and Settlement Agreement’s requirement for a two-year continuous \nperiod of good faith determinations as to the seven Delayed Performance Area Measures.  Thus, \nthe Twenty-Second Commentary serves as the Final Report both with respect to the Delayed \nPerformance Area Measures and the Compromise and Settlement Agreement as a whole.  \n \n1 The “COVID Recovery Period” included the following:  (1) January 1, 2021 through June 30, \n2021; (ii) July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021; and (iii) January 1, 2022 through June 30, \n2022.  [Doc. 908-1, p. 3].   \n  - 3 - \n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-fhm     Document 917 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 03/13/25     Page 4 of\n5\nOn March 12, 2025, the Department filed a Notice of No Objection to the Final Report.  \n[Doc. 912].2  \nOn March 13, 2025, the court held a hearing on the Twenty-Second Commentary.  [Doc. \n915].  During the hearing, plaintiffs presented a Notice advising that they do not object to the Final \nReport and will not file a Notice of Appeal. [Doc. 916]. \nHaving reviewed the report and there being no objection, the court concludes that the \nTwenty-Second  Commentary  of  the  Co-Neutrals  constitutes  the  Final Report  for  the  seven \nDelayed Performance Area Measures.  The Department’s obligations under the Compromise and \nSettlement  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  respect  to  the  seven  Delayed  Performance  Area \nMeasures are terminated.   \nFurther, having previously terminated the Department’s obligations under the Compromise \nand  Settlement  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  respect  to  the  twenty-three  Non-Impacted \nPerformance Area Measures, the defendants’ obligations under the Compromise and Settlement \nAgreement are satisfied.  \nWHEREFORE, the Motion Seeking this Court’s Acceptance and Approval [Doc. 913] of \ndefendant the Oklahoma Department of Human Services is granted.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Department’s obligations under the Compromise and \nSettlement  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  respect  to  the  seven  Delayed  Performance  Area \nMeasures are terminated.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendants’ obligations under the Compromise and \nSettlement Agreement are satisfied.  \n \n2 The Compromise and Settlement Agreement provides a thirty-day period for the parties to appeal \nto the court the Final Report of the Co-Neutrals.

They sought certification of a class of \nfoster children in the legal custody of DHS, alleging DHS’s agency-wide foster care policies and \npractices expose all class members to an impermissible risk of harm in violation of their \nFourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process.  Additionally, Named Plaintiffs alleged \nclass-wide violations of their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to procedural due process \nand liberty and privacy interests under the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n  On May 5, 2009, the court, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, certified the following class: \n_________________________________________________________________________________________ \n* Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d), Brad Yarbrough is substituted for Richard L. DeVaughn as \nChairman of the Oklahoma Commission for Human Services. \n\n  All children who are or will be in the legal custody of the Oklahoma Department \n  of Human Services (1) due to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect; or (2) who \n  are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect. \n \n[Dkt. #272 at 17].  In so ruling, the court—accepting as true the allegations of the complaint—\nfound plaintiffs had satisfied the requisites for Rule 23(a) of numerosity, commonality, typicality \nand adequacy of representation  [Id. at 7-11].  Based upon the Statement of Relief [Dkt. #241] \nfiled by plaintiffs pursuant to Shook v. Board of County Commissioners, 543 F.3d 597, 605 (10th \nCir. 2008), the court identified at least one common issue of fact:  Whether DHS has a policy or \npractice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of Plaintiff Children causing significant harm \nand risk of harm to their safety.  [Id. at 9].  The court also found that this common issue of fact \nraised at least one common legal issue:  Whether the alleged policies or practices violate \nplaintiffs’ right to be reasonably free from harm and imminent risk of harm while in state \ncustody.  [Id. at 9-10].   The court concluded that at least one remedy sought by Named \nPlaintiffs—their request for an injunction setting limits on the caseloads of caseworkers and their \nsupervisors—met the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d) for a remedy that is both \ncohesive and sufficiently specific. [Id. at 13].   \n  The Tenth Circuit affirmed the court’s class certification order on interlocutory appeal.  \nD.G. ex rel Stricklin v. DeVaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1195 (10th Cir. 2010).  The parties have since \nconducted and completed classwide discovery.  Defendants now urge the court to decertify the \nclass pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(C), asserting the evidence adduced does not show commonality \nunder Rule 23(a)(2) or that DHS has “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \nthe class.”  Defendants simultaneously filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all of plaintiffs’ \nclaims, including the claims at issue in this motion.  [Dkt. #561].   \n2 \n\n  In General Telephone Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982), the court \nobserved , “the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the \nfactual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs’ cause of action.”  (quotations and citations \nomitted).  This case is no exception.  The factual and legal issues underlying the class \ncertification issue are intertwined, at least to some extent, with the facts and law at issue in \ndefendants’ summary judgment motion.    \nI. Applicable Legal Standards \n  An order that grants class certification may be altered or amended at any time before final \njudgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(C).  DG, 594 F.3d at 1201-02; Weinman v. Fid. Captial \nAppreciation Fund, 354 F.3d 1246, 1261 (10th Cir. 2004).  While the decision to decertify is \ndiscretionary, Id., the court has an obligation to monitor the class decision in light of evidentiary \ndevelopments in the case.  See Anderson v. Boeing Co., 2006 WL 2990383 at *1 (N.D. Okla. \nOctober 16, 2006); Beer v. XTO Energy, Inc., 2010 WL 2773311 at *2 (W.D. Okla. July 13, \n2010).   \nIn its class certification order, the court, as required by law, accepted as true the \nsubstantive allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint,  See Shook v. El Paso County, 386 F.3d 963, 968 \n(10th Cir. 2004),  and stressed that its decision to certify a class was not a decision on the merits.  \n[Dkt. #272 at 7].  Even at this juncture, the court cannot and will not decide the case on the \nmerits.  Lightfoot v. District of Columbia, 273 F.R.D. 314, 323 n. 6 (D.D.C. 2011);  Anderson at \n*2.  However, a review of the decision is appropriate at this time in light of the extensive \ndiscovery undertaken since the court’s initial certification of the class. \n3 \n\n  Defendants’ post-discovery challenge focuses, once again, on whether the evidence \nadduced satisfies Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirement of commonality and the requirements for \ncohesiveness and specificity of remedies imposed by Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d). \n  Plaintiff Children acknowledge they retain the burden of establishing commonality under \nRule 23(a)(2).  [Dkt. #599 at 8].  The finding of commonality requires only a single issue of fact \nor law common to the class.  J.B. v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1288 (10th Cir. 1999).  However, \nmere allegations of systemic failures of an agency such as DHS will not suffice; a discrete legal \nor factual question common to the class must exist.  DG, 594 F.3d at 1195, citing J.B., 186 F.3d \nat 1288.  The Tenth Circuit will not allow plaintiffs “to broadly conflate a variety of claims to \nestablish commonality via an allegation of system failures.”  J.B., 186 F.3d at 1288-89.  \n  In its ruling denying defendants’ appeal of the court’s class certification order, the Tenth \nCircuit instructed, “Rule 23’s certification requirements neither require all class members to \nsuffer harm nor Name Plaintiffs to prove class members have suffered such harm.”  594 F.3d at \n1198.   The court stated: \n  [A] class will often include persons who have not been injured by the defendant’s \n  conduct….Such a possibility or indeed inevitability does not preclude class \n  certification.  Rule 23(a) only requires the district court to find a question of fact \n  or law common to all class members.  Requiring Named Plaintiffs to prove all class \n  members were inadequately monitored or are actually exposed to a threat of harm \n  due to OKDHS’s monitoring practices at the certification stage would require them \n  to answer the common question of fact or law, rather than just prove it exists.  Rule \n  23(a) does not require the district court to have an answer before certifying a class; \n  Classwide discovery and further litigation answer the question after certification. \n \nId.  (quotations and citations omitted).   \n \n  Another statement by the Tenth Circuit in this case bears repeating: \n \n  Defendants maintain because the evidence presented demonstrated a class member \n  has only a 1.2% chance of being injured, then 98.8% of the putative class is not \n  under an imminent threat of serious harm and, therefore, no issue of fact or law \n  common to its members exists.  This argument entirely misses the mark.  The \n4 \n\n  “injury” the Named Plaintiffs allege which the district court found constituted \n  a question of fact common to the class is not solely actual abuse or neglect.  The \n  injury, instead, includes exposure to an impermissible risk of harm due to OKDHS’s \n  alleged agency-wide failure to monitor class members adequately.  That “only” \n  1.2% of OKDHS foster children actually suffered abuse reveals nothing about  \nhow many of those children were not properly monitored and yet survived an \nunconstitutional risk of abuse or neglect unscathed.  Logically, the fact that 1.2% \nof OKDHS foster children reported abuse or neglect does not mean the rest of \nthe class was not exposed to an impermissible risk of serious harm.  In theory, \n100% of foster children could live under an imminent threat of serious harm, but \nonly 1.2% ultimately suffer and report abuse or neglect. \n \nId.  Thus, the court is mindful that the issue here is not what percentage of children have actually \nsuffered abuse while in state custody, but whether and to what extent foster children are at \nimminent risk of serious harm.   \nII. Analysis \nA.  Applicability of Wal-Mart Decision \nCiting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 254, (June 20, 2011), defendants renew \ntheir argument that Named Plaintiffs have failed to identify any common  issues of fact or law.  \nIn Wal-Mart, named plaintiffs sought certification of a nationwide class of some 1.5 million \nfemale employees claiming local managers of Wal-Mart exercised their discretion over pay and \npromotions disproportionately in favor of men, and Wal-Mart’s refusal to cabin its managers’ \nauthority amounted to disparate treatment.  Id. at 2544.  The district court granted plaintiffs’ \nmotion for class certification and the Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed the decision.  Id.  The \nSupreme Court reversed, finding certification of the plaintiff class was not consistent with Rule \n23(a)(2).  In so ruling, the court observed: \n[I]n resolving an individual’s Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is the  \nreason for a particular employment decision.  Here, respondents wish to sue \nabout literally millions of employment decisions at once.  Without some glue \nholding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible  \nto say that examination of all the class members’ claims for relief will produce a \ncommon answer to the crucial question why was I disfavored. \n5 \n\n \nId. at 2552.  (emphasis in original) (quotation and citation omitted).  Wal-Mart had an explicit \npolicy of nondiscrimination and hiring  Id. at 2550-51.   The court stated: \n  Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have \n  suffered the same injury.  This does not mean that they have all suffered a violation \n  of the same provision of law….Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of  \n  the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate- \n  impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can be \n  productively litigated at once.  Their claims must depend upon a common \n  contention—for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of \n  the same supervisor.  That common contention, moreover, must be of such a \n  nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination \n  of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \n  one of the claims in one stroke. \n \n  What matters to class certification…is not the raising of common “Questions”— \n  even in droves—but rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate \n  common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.  Dissimilarities \n  within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation \n  of common answers. \n \nId. at 2551 (quotations and citations omitted).   \n \n  In Wal-Mart, plaintiff were unable to identify “some glue holding the alleged reason for \n[plaintiffs’ harms] together,” so that the case would be capable of class-wide resolution.  Id. at \n2552.   Defendants assert the same is true in this case.  The court disagrees.   \nHere, as the Tenth Circuit noted, “every class member, by virtue of being in OKDHS \ncustody, is subject to OKDHS’s monitoring practices or lack thereof…”  DG, 594 F.3d at 1197, \nand faces harm or imminent risk of harm if the monitoring practices are insufficient.  Further, \nplaintiffs have identified at least one proposed remedy or “answer”—i.e., an injunction setting \nlimits on caseloads—that would be common to all plaintiffs.   \nIn Wal-Mart, the court described how the commonality issue must be approached in an \nemployment discrimination case, pointing out: “[T]here is a wide gap between (1) an \nindividual’s claim that he has been denied a promotion [or higher pay] on discriminatory \n6 \n\ngrounds, and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of \ndiscrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as \nthat individual, such that the individual’s claim and the class claim will share common questions \nof law or fact and that the individual’s claim will be typical of the class claims.”  Id. at 2553, \nciting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157-58.   The court, citing Falcon, suggested one way plaintiffs could \nbridge the gap was to show “significant proof” that Wal-Mart operated under a general policy of \ndiscrimination.  Id. \n  Based on this statement, defendants suggest plaintiffs must come forward with \n“significant proof” that DHS has a policy or practice of failing to adequately monitor the safety \nof plaintiffs, causing significant harm or risk of harm to their safety. \n  The court is not convinced “significant proof” is required for plaintiffs to resist \ndefendants’ motion to decertify, or whether some lesser standard is required outside of \nemployment discrimination cases.1  However, even assuming “significant proof” is the \nappropriate standard, the court finds, as set forth below, that  plaintiffs have met that standard \nwith respect to the bases upon which the class was initially certified.  \nB. Failure to Monitor Safety of Children \nPlaintiffs assert that notwithstanding the official policy of DHS, the agency has an actual \npractice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of plaintiff children, causing significant harm \nand risk of harm to their safety.  They cite the following evidence in support of their claim: \n1.  The Oklahoma Commission for Human Services has conceded it makes no \nattempt monitor children in its custody. \n \n2.  DHS caseworker caseloads are excessively high. \n                                                 \n1 In Vuyanich v. Republic Bank of Dallas, the court recognized that the standard of proof for \nsatisfying elements required for certification under Rule 223(a) is “ill-defined” and “has not yet \n[been] articulated by the higher courts.”  505 F. Supp. 224, 239 (N.D. Tex. 1980). \n7 \n\n \n3.  A large percentage of children are not being visited as required by regulation. \n \n \n1. Commission’s Alleged Lack of Monitoring Efforts \n \nThe Oklahoma Commission for Human Services has oversight responsibility for the \nconduct of the state’s foster care system and is responsible for hiring, firing and setting the salary \nof the DHS Director.  Okla. Const., art. 25, §§ 3-4.  Plaintiffs allege the Commission has made \nno attempt at all to monitor the problems at DHS that result in harm to children.   \n  The Commission usually meets monthly for two to three hours.  [Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, \nAneta Wilkinson Dep., 70:14-21; Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Steven Dow Dep., 102:16-20; Dkt. \n#601-23, Ex. 23, Michael Peck Dep., 88:21-25].  Steven Dow, who was appointed to the \nCommission after this lawsuit was filed, testified that in his opinion, “the meetings are rather \nperfunctory and not very engaging with respect to the level of oversight that the Commission is \nproviding.” [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22. Dow Dep., 103:15-18].   \n  Commissioners generally do not set the agenda, but consider only the information \nselected and provided by the Director and senior DHS managers.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, \nHendrick Dep., 29:5-14; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., 187:15-188:7].  Commissioner Steven \nDow testified that in his tenure, the Commission has never inquired about, or been told anything \nnegative about, the performance of DHS’s child welfare operations, or any shortcomings “that \nwe as a Commission ought to know whether self-identified or identified by an outside body.”  \n[Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 70:21-71:7, 108:4-14].  Director Hendrick testified in recent \nhistory no commissioners have asked him for a report on anything relating to child welfare, and \nno one has come in and talked about any of the department’s data that was troubling to them.  \n[Dkt. 601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 29:15-19, 33:7-13].  Commissioner DeVaughn could not \n8 \n\nremember whether there have been any reports to the Commission on rate of abuse in care, the \nnumber of placements per child, the number of permanency plans put in place by the department, \nthe length of stay in custody of foster children, out-of-county placements, family separations, or \nthe shortage of foster care homes available for children in the custody of the state.  [Dkt. #602-2, \nEx. 27, DeVaughn Dep., 23:23-25:21].  He testified regarding missed caseworker visits, that \n“Most all information is presented in forms, but as to getting down to the specific items, I can’t \nrecall…specificity on those.”  [Id., 24:23-25:8].   \nCommissioner Michael Peck did not ask for, nor does he remember receiving, any data \non services such as independent-living services provided to children, caseworker visits to \nchildren, visits between children and their parents, visits between workers and children’s parents, \nor worker caseloads.  [Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, 106:15-107:13]. He does not think the Commission \nhas ever asked for, or been provided with any, updates about DHS’s performance on federal \nstandards for foster children.  [Id., 132:19-21].  He has never asked for, nor been given \ninformation about abuse and neglect in care for calendar year 2011 to date, and does not know if \nit is trending up or down.  [Id., 145:25-146:8].  He does not recall the Commission asking for, \nnor receiving, any data on caseworker visitation.  [Id., 152:17-20].  He recalls no discussions \nabout placement stability at Commission meetings.  [Id., 159:11-14].  There has been no \ndiscussion about how DHS is doing on meeting its own policies with respect to visits between \nchildren and their parents and between workers and parents.  [Id., 175:11-20].  He does not know \nwhether there has recently been overcrowding and overcapacity at the DHS’s two shelters.  [Id., \n199:25-200:8].   \nCommissioner Linda Weeks testified she was unaware that from 2005 to 2008, \nOklahoma was among the bottom five states in the country on the federal government’s measure \n9 \n\nof abuse in care.  [Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 95:12-23].  She was unaware of how the \nOklahoma DHS performed in the data on abuse in care for 2009 or 2010.  [Id., 96: 8-14].  She \ncannot recall any discussions about shelters other than the locations of the two shelters DHS has.  \n[Id., 115:18-23]. \n  Commissioner Aneta Wilkinson testified that although she does not have any specific \nrecollection of discussions about caseloads, she is sure there have been discussions, and the \ndiscussions would be reflected in minutes of the meetings.  [Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Wilkinson \nDep., 128:20-129:19].  Similarly, she did not recall discussion about placement and stability at \nthe Commission meetings, but stated they would be reflected in the minutes of the meetings.  \n[Id., 145:14-20].   \n  Commissioner George Young testified commissioners receive monthly reports used to \nmeasure the performance of children in the custody of DHS.  [Dkt. #602-1, Ex. 26, Young Dep., \n27:16-25].  He did not think the reports included a rate of abuse in care.  [Id., 28:22-29:1]. \n  Commissioner Dow does not recall any discussion of child welfare worker caseloads at \nthe Commission’s meetings.  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, 176:2-5].  He has not asked for, nor been \ngiven any, information by DHS that would help him evaluate caseload levels, although he \nbelieves he could ask for the information.  [Id., 176-:22-177:6].  Dow recalls no discussion at \nCommission meetings about worker/parent or worker/child contacts or whether those policy \nexpectations are being met.  [Id., 194:7-14; 195:4-6]. \n  The Commission never inquired about, and was never informed of, the outcome of DHS’s \nmost recent federal CFSR [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 138:7-21; Dkt. #602-2, Ex. 27, \nDeVaughn Dep., 64:22-65:1; Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 73:4-8; 75:9-17; Dkt. #601-25, \nEx. 25, Weeks Dep.,  52:14-18; Dkt. #602-1, Ex. 26, Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 21, Dkt. #601-24:133:9-\n10 \n\n23; 135:7-14, 138:7-21].Wilkinson Dep., 57:6-19; Young Dep., 45:7-15, 48:6-11; 102:11-103:4, \n103:20-15].  Nor did commissioners ask about, or receive information about, the February 2009 \nPerformance Audit of DHS commissioned by the state legislature, although commissioners were \ntold about legislative proposed changes.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 143:13-144:9, \n150:24-151:12; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., 133:13-18, 134:4-17; Dkt. #602-1, Ex. 26, \nYoung Dep., 43:2-13, 86:4-12]. \n    In accordance with state law, DHS was accredited by the Council on Accreditation \n(“COA”) from 1985 to 2002.  [10A O.S. § 1-9-105(A)(4); Dkt. #602-3, Ex. 28, Letter from COA \nto Hendrick, COA-5-00012].  In September 2002, DHS chose not to renew its accreditation.  \n[Dkt. #602-3, Ex. 28, Letter from Hendrick to COA, COA-5-00010].  The Oklahoma DHS \nremains unaccredited to date.  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶6].  \nCurrent commissioners were unaware of the statute requiring COA accreditation or DHS’s \nviolation of it, although the Commission at the time was.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., \n128:12-129:2; Dkt. #602-2, Ex. 27, DeVaughn Dep., 77:24-78:3, 78:16-23, 83:4-19; Dkt. #601-\n22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 217:10-23; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., 203:23-204:15; Dkt. #601-\n25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 128:25-129:2; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Wilkinson Dep., 213:23-214:6; \n214:15-21, 215:1-6; Dkt. #602-1, Ex. 26, Young Dep., 55:15-24, 56:24-57:3, 57:14-15, 61:25-\n62:4, 62:16-17]. \n    Finally, plaintiffs’ expert John Goad opines that in no fewer than 64 (19%) and as many \nas 157 (46%) of 343 DHS investigations into reports of maltreatment of foster children during \n2009, the investigators’ findings were flawed.  [Dkt. #610-2, Ex. 31, Goad Report, pp. 37-38].  \n11 \n\nThis, plaintiffs contend, is additional evidence of defendants’ failure to exercise professional \njudgment.2 \n2. Child Welfare Worker Caseloads \nDHS managers and Commissioners admit that manageable caseloads for child welfare \nworkers are important to ensure that children are kept safe from harm.  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, \nDow Dep., 175:16-176:1; Dkt. #602-25, Ex. 49, Gary Miller Dep., 229:19-230:6; Dkt. #603-2, \nEx. 52, Deborah Smith Dep., 144:16-145:3; Dkt. #603-3, Ex. 53, Joanie Webster Dep., 48:17-25, \n51:14-52:5, 52:19-53:13; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 39:5-40:3; Dkt. #601-3, Ex. 3, Amy \nWhite Dep., 184:14-24; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Wilkinson Dep., 16:6-15, 127:17-23; Dkt. #603-4, \nEx. 54, Marq Youngblodd Dep., 224:15-23; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck, 38:1-3, 38:12-39:2].  \nSimilarly, both plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts acknowledge the importance of reasonable \ncaseloads in protecting foster children.  [Dkt. #603-5, Ex. 55, Affid. of Peg Hess, PhD, ACSW, \n¶6(a); Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 2, Viola Miller, Ed.D.

[Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional \nMaterial Facts, ¶25 and Dkt. #602-3, Ex. 28, PA-FC 19.06, PA-KC 16.06].  CWLA sets out \nsimilar standards.  [Dkt. #603-7, Ex. 57, CWLA Standards for Foster Care Services, § 3.48, KC \n§ 4.20]. \nEvery child in DHS custody is assigned a “primary” caseworker who is located in the \ncounty of juvenile court jurisdiction.  When a child is placed outside the county of court \njurisdiction, the child is also assigned a “secondary” worker in the county of placement.  OAC §§ \n340:75-1-29, 340:75-6-48.  DHS managers have testified that both primary and secondary \nworkers have equal and important responsibilities and both must be taken into account when \ncalculating workers’ caseloads.  [Dkt. #603-8, Ex. 58, Johnson Dep., 85:3-20, 115:13-118:3; \nDkt. #603-2, Ex. 52, D. Smith Dep., 145:4-23; Dkt. #601-3, Ex.3, White Dep. (5/12/11), \n188:17189:9].  As of May 2011, 41% of children in DHS custody were placed outside the county \nof court jurisdiction.  [Dkt. #603-10, Ex. 60, DHS Placement Summary, Y1617A-00380-81].   \nDHS’s “YI743 report” as of March 2011 shows that more than 5,300 children in out-of-\nhome care (68% of the total number of such children) had a primary caseworker whose caseload \nwas greater than 20 children; more than 3,000 children had a primary worker whose caseload \nwas greater than 25 children; and more than 1,200 children had a primary caseworker whose \n13 \n\ncaseload was more than 30 children. [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional Material \nFacts, ¶34 and Dkt. #603-15, Ex. 65, YI743 Report “built on December, 10, 2010”].   \nLarry Johnson, Director of the DHS Field Operations Division (“FOD”), acknowledged \nthat another report he uses to track average worker caseloads—referred to as the Combined \nWorkload Report (“CWR”)—omits entire categories of assignments from its calculation of \naverage workloads, and thus understates the average number of children assigned to permanency \nplanning workers  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional Material Facts, ¶¶29-30]. \n  Defendants’ own expert, Robin Arnold-Williams, concluded that DHS does not \naccurately measure caseloads and that its caseloads exceed professionally accepted standards.  \n[Dkt.601-10, Ex. 10, Arnold-Williams Report, at 5].  Commissioners Peck and Weeks admit that \nworker caseloads are too high.  [Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep.,146:17-148:6, 151:4-9, 212:6-\n24; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 62:16-64:2.   \n  Defendants’ expert Robin Arnold-Williams testified issues with caseloads continue [Dkt. \n#720-1, Ex. 29, Arnold-Williams Dep., 144:18-19], that caseloads need to be reduced [Id., \n145:21-145:2], that current reporting practices hamper effective caseload and workload \nmonitoring [Id., 150:15-151:3], and that in her opinion, “the best professional judgment would \nbe to seek more staff and to...reduce [caseloads] down lower, which I have recommended in [my \nreport].  [Id., 216:16-217:19].  Defendants’ expert Larry Brown opined that individual caseload \nor workload levels are, at this point, known only “at an individual unit level.”  [Dkt. #603-6, Ex. \n56, Larry Brown Dep., 85:6-10], that “there is no systematic way that the central office here—or \nin Oklahoma City can know that information,” [Id., 87:4-21], that Johnson “doesn’t have the data \nthat he needs to manage the system,” and “[h]e’s working to develop a report to give him that \ninformation,” and “those are positive steps that demonstrate to me that there’s reasonable \n14 \n\nexercise of some professional judgment that’s being shown here.”  [Id., 103:13-104:1].  In her \nreport, plaintiffs’ expert Viola P. Miller opined that caseworkers were inadequately supervised \nand staff turnover is excessive.  [Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 2, Miller Report]. \n3. DHS Case Worker Visits \nFederal law requires monthly visits between caseworkers and children in foster care.  42 \nU.S.C. § 624(2)(A).  DHS policy also requires visits with each foster child a minimum of one \ntime per month, with no less than two visits per quarter in the foster placement.  168 Okla. \nAdmin. Code (“OAC”) 340:75-6-48.  Each child is to be interviewed, or if an infant observed, \nalone without the foster parent present at least one time per quarter.  Id.   \n  DHS Commissioners and managers and experts on both sides admit worker-child \nvisitation is important, that it is critical for the same worker to visit the child each month and that \nthe visit should include one-on-one interactions with the child as well as observation of the \nchild’s interactions with others.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. #24, Howard Hendrick Depo., 173:8-18; \n174:12-175:10; 175:21-176:1; Dkt. #603-8, Ex. #58, Larry Johnson Depo., 59:11-60:10; Dkt. \n#601-23, Ex. #23, Michael Peck Depo., 37:4-25, 151:20-23, 152:2-11; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. #25, \nLinda Weeks Depo., 35:7-24, 36:23-25, 62:16-63:1; Dkt. #601-3, Ex. #3, Amy White Depo., \n318:19-23; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Aneta Wilkinson Depo., 15:17-16:5; Dkt. #602-1, Ex. #26, \nGeorge Young Depo., 36:13-25, 95:23-25, 97:9-15, 98:3-1; Dkt. #603-4, Ex. #54, Marq \nYoungblood Depo., 213:9-24; Dkt. #602-4, Ex. 29, Robin Arnold-Williams Depo., 195:25-\n196:14; Dkt. #601-16, Viola Miller Depo., 141:24-142:5; Dkt. #601-1, Foster Care Case Review \nof the OKDHS by Center for the Support of Families (CSF), Inc., p.70].  Additionally, the \nfederal government has found an association between caseworker visits and positive outcomes \nfor children.  [Dkt. #606-4, Ex. 129, Results of the 2007 and 2008 Child and Family Services \n15 \n\nReviews at 22-24; Dkt. #606-5, Ex. 130, “52 Program Improvement Plans—Strategies for \nImproving Child Welfare Services and Outcomes,” at 36-38; Dkt. #606-6, Ex. 131, GAO Child \nWelfare report, at 24-25, 33].   \nPlaintiffs contend in practice, however, the requisite visits are not occurring.  Larry \nJohnson, Director of the DHS Field Operations Division (“FOD”), stated in his declaration that \nthe FOD is responsible for accurate and timely delivery of services to eligible clients of the \nCFSD, the Family Support Services Division and the AIDS Coordination Information Service.  \n[Dkt. #558, Ex. 8, Decl. of Larry Johnson, ¶2].  Approximately 1,000 of 3,700 FOD staff are \nchild welfare workers.  [Id.].  DHS keeps track of the number of visits or “contacts” of its \nworkers with foster children.  A copy of the report is attached to his declaration and referred to \nas Ex. 15-1, Contacts Report June 2011, run July 10, 2011.  [Id., ¶3]. Johnson states that  \nbetween 90% and 96% of children living in their own homes while in foster care jurisdiction \nreceived the required visits; between 96% and 98.6% of children in therapeutic foster care \n(“TCF”) placements received the required visits.  Of the 20 or fewer children in unpaid relative \nplacements each month, between 90% and 100% received the required visits each month.  \nJohnson states that data regularly kept by DHS indicate that, since July 2000, DHS workers have \nmade monthly visits to children in foster care due a visit over 90% of the time.  Since January \n2007, data shows DHS workers have made more than 95% of monthly visits in all but two \nmonths.  In those months, 94.2% and 94.9% of visits were made.  [Id., ¶3]. \n  However, the report, “Caseworker Visits: Visited Every Month (Required Federal \nReporting),” shows that 3,707 children—32% of all children in out-of-home care for at least one \nmonth as of December 2010—did not receive all 12 monthly visits due that year.  [Dkt. #600, \nPlaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts ¶64; Dkt. #606-7, Ex. 132].  Defendants’ \n16 \n\nexpert, Robin Arnold-Williams, recommends in her report that DHS should “[c]ontinue progress \nmeeting federal expectations in the area of monthly visitation between case workers and \nchildren. [Dkt. #601-10, Ex. 10, A Review of Management of OKDHS’s Child Welfare System, \nRobin Arnold-Williams, D.S.W. at 7, 58]. \n  Plaintiffs assert, “In light of the large number and percentage of children whom DHS \nworkers have failed to visit, it is fair to say that all members of the Plaintiff Class are at risk of \nbeing assigned to a caseworker who will miss a required visit.” \n  The Tenth Circuit, in affirming the class certification decision, rejected an argument by \nDHS that because a child in custody of the state has less than a 2% chance of being injured there \nis a dearth of commonality.  As the appellate court noted, the injury alleged in this case is “not \nsolely actual abuse or neglect,” but includes “exposure to an impermissible risk of harm.”  The \ncourt finds plaintiffs have presented “significant proof” of exposure to an impermissible risk of \nharm.   \n  The court finds that plaintiffs have presented “significant proof” that DHS has a policy or \npractice of failing to adequately monitor the safety of plaintiff children causing significant harm \nand risk of harm to their safety.  In so finding, the court stresses that it is not making a finding \nthat DHS in fact has such a policy or practice; rather, the court merely concludes Plaintiff \nChildren have met the burden described in Wal-Mart to survive defendants’ motion to decertify \nthe class.  A determination on the merits of the claim still lies ahead. \nC. Other Alleged Common Issues of Fact and Law \n  Plaintiffs allege the evidence shows the existence of other common issues of fact and \nlaw, including:  (1) Whether DHS is subjecting Plaintiff Children to an impermissible level and \nrisk of abuse and neglect while in state custody; (2) whether DHS has failed to develop a \n17 \n\nsufficient number and array of placement resources;  (3) whether DHS has a practice of \nsubjecting Plaintiff Children to impermissibly frequent placement moves; and (4) whether DHS \nhas a practice of subjecting Plaintiff Children to excessively long stays in state custody.   The \nremaining issues are considered below. \n1.  Abuse in Care \nNamed Plaintiffs assert the issue of whether DHS subjects foster children to an \nimpermissible level and risk of abuse and neglect while in state custody presents a common \nquestion of fact suitable for class certification. \nThe federal government tracks the rate at which children are abused or neglected while in \nstate foster care (the “abuse-in-care rate”).  The rate is calculated by taking the number of child \nvictims of maltreatment perpetrated by foster parents and facility staff, and dividing it by the \nnumber of children served in foster care during the reporting year.  [Dkt. #602-12, Ex. 36, Child \nMaltreatment 2009, p. 24].   \nPlaintiffs have presented evidence that for every year from federal fiscal year (“FFY”) \n2002 through FFY 2010, DHS’s reported rate at which children in its custody are being \nmaltreated (the “abuse-in-care rate”) has been 1.54 to 3.97 times greater than the federal \nstandard, and was among the five highest reported rates in the country from FFY 2002 through \nFFY 2008.  [Dkt. #602-13, Ex. 37 NCANDS-DP-00001; Dkt. #602-14, Ex. 38 State-CFSR-\n2007-09956; Dkt. #602-15, Ex. 39, CDSR.PIP.Huckabee-00004, Dkt. #602-16, Dkt. #602-16, \nEx. 40, CSFR.PIP.Farjardo-00002; Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 5 HindmanB-012423; ].  From FFY 2002 to \nFFY 2008, DHS’s reported abuse-in-care rate was among the five highest reporting jurisdictions \nin the country.  [Dkt. #602-19, Ex. 43 PLAINTIFFS 01220.1-01220.2; Dkt. #602-20, Ex. 44 \nChildren’s Bureau, Child Maltreatment 2004, 64; Dkt. #602-12, Ex. 36, Child Maltreatment \n18 \n\n2009, 53].  Additionally, Director Hendrick testified DHS does not report to the federal \ngovernment any instances of maltreatment committed by facility staff members.  [Id., ¶13 and \nEx. 24, Hendrick Dep. 70:13-24].  Thus, plaintiffs assert, the DHS is under-reporting abuse-in-\ncare rates.  Defendants acknowledge that at least 154 children in 2009 and 80 children in 2010 \nwere maltreated by facility staff.  [Id., ¶14 and Ex. 45 Lee Decl. ¶¶1-2].  If the 154 children had \nbeen included in DHS’s reported abuse-in-care data for 2009, DHS would have reported a total \nof 241 children abused by foster parents and facility staff during that year, setting DHS’s abuse-\nin-care rate at 1.58%--almost five times the federal standard.  Likewise, if the other 80 children \nhad been included in DHS’s reported abuse-in-care data for FFY 2010, DHS would have \nreported a total of 183 children abused by foster parents and facility staff during that year, setting \nDHS’s abuse-in-care rate at 1.41%--more than four times the federal standard.  [Id., Ex. 37 \nNCANDS-DP-00002].  The number reported by DHS also does not include children abused by \ntheir birth parents while in DHS custody.  [Dkt. #561, Ex. 18, ¶9].    Defendant’s expert Barclay \ntestified that such maltreatment should be considered to obtain a fuller picture of abuse in care.  \n[Dkt. #601-9, Ex. 9, Barclay Dep., 162:7-15].  According to DHS data, 210 children in FFY \n2009 and another 191 children in FFY 2010 were maltreated by their birth parents while in DHS \ncustody.  [Dkt. #561, Ex. 18-2 Row XI]. \n  After this lawsuit was filed, Director Hendrick directed DHS to conduct an \n“administrative review” of all reports of maltreatment in care already substantiated by DHS’s \nCPS staff.  The administrative review continues to date.  [Dkt. #602-22, Ex. 46, Margaret \nDevault Dep., 145:19-146:7; Dkt, #602-23, Ex. 47, Debra Knecht Dep., 13:5-15, 33:223-34:3; \nDkt. #605-2, Ex. 102 (Dep. Ex. 605)].  The reviewers were allegedly instructed to reverse any \nsubstantiated findings of child maltreatment they believed were decided incorrectly, or where \n19 \n\nthere was insufficient information in the case file.  [Dkt. #602-22, Ex. 46, Devault Dep., 145:19-\n146:7; Dkt. #602-23, Ex. 47, Knecht Dep, 30:6-20].  Since DHS does not include unsubstantiated \nreports in this process, the review’s results can only lower its abuse-in-care rate.  [Dkt. #602-22, \nEx. 46, DeVault Dep., 121:18-122:10; Dkt. #602-23, Ex. 47, Knecht Dep., 30:6-20; Dkt. #602-\n25, Ex. 49, Gary Miller Dep., 231:25-233:14].  At least 61 substantiated findings of child \nmaltreatment involving foster parents were reversed between 2008 and 2010.  [Dkt. #602-22, Ex. \n46, DeValut Dep., 131:25-132:2; Dkt. #602-23, Ex. 47, Knecht Dep., 15:7-23].  Defendants’ \nexperts Dr. John Fluke and Andrew Barclay, as well as Margaret DeVault, the former Program \nAdministrator of DHS’s Prevention and Protection Unit, admitted that if DHS’s goal is to \ndetermine the accuracy of its reported abuse in care, both substantiated and unsubstantiated \nfindings must be reviewed.  [Dkt. #602-22, Ex. 46, DeVault Dep., 122:4-15; Dkt. #602-7, Ex. 32, \nJohn Fluke Dep., 215:25-216:23; Dkt. #601-9, Ex. 9, Andrew Barclay Dep., 93:12-22]. \n  The question of whether the abuse in care rate is excessive (or whether it is even \naccurately tracked) is closely related to the common issue of whether defendants have failed to \nadequately monitor the safety of foster children.  Indeed, the agency’s ability to accurately track \ninstances of abuse inevitably impacts the efficacy of its monitoring efforts.  It is an issue that \naffects foster children on a class wide basis and for which a class wide remedy—i.e., improved \ninvestigatory techniques and reporting—is conceivable.  Moreover, the proposed remedy is both \ncohesive and sufficiently specific.  Therefore, the court finds this issue is appropriate for class \ncertification. \n2. Number and Array of Placements/Impermissibly Frequent Placement Moves \n  In its order granting plaintiffs’ motion to certify, the court stated: \n  [T]he question whether DHS has a policy or practice of subjecting plaintiffs to \n  unreasonably frequent moves from placement to placement causing significant \n20 \n\n  harm and risk of harm to plaintiffs’ health and well-being is not common to all \n  children because many, perhaps the majority, of children in foster care are not \n  subjected to frequent moves. \n \n[Dkt. #272 at 9].  The court remains unpersuaded that the allegation of impermissibly frequent \nplacement moves presents a common question of fact.  Likewise, the alleged inadequacy of \nplacement options lacks commonality.  Moreover, these issues do not necessarily give rise to the \nlegal question presented by inadequate monitoring—that is, whether the alleged policies or \npractices violate plaintiffs’ right to be reasonably free from harm and imminent risk of harm \nwhile in state custody.  It is fairly easy to “connect the dots” between situations in which child \nwelfare workers have excessive caseloads, miss required visits with children, or fail to properly \ninvestigate suspected abuse or neglect with resulting harm or risk of harm to children.  The \nrelationship between frequent placement moves or limited placement options and the safety of \nchildren is more attenuated.  While these two factors could lead to less than ideal placements, \nthey do not necessarily put a child in harm’s way.  Therefore, the court finds these two issues do \nnot present common questions of fact or law.   \n                         3. Excessive Stays in State Custody \nPlaintiffs also urge the court to certify the class based on the question of whether \ndefendants’ policies and practices subject foster children to excessively long stays in state \ncustody.  However, this issue—like the issues of placement options and excessive placement \nmoves—fails to meet the commonality requirement.  Most children are not subjected to \nexcessively long stays in state custody, and the connection between long stays and harm or risk \nof harm to children is much more attenuated than, for example, the connection between \ninadequate investigations into reports of abuse and resultant harm or risk of harm to children.  \nTherefore, the court declines to expand class certification to this issue. \n21 \n\n \n \nIII. Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ Motion to Decertify the Class [Dkt. #558] is \ndenied.  The class remains certified on the question of whether DHS has a policy or practice of \nfailing to adequately monitor the safety of Plaintiff Children causing significant harm and risk of \nharm to their safety.  Additionally, the class is certified on the question of whether DHS is \nsubjecting Plaintiff Children to an impermissible level and risk of abuse and neglect while in \nstate custody. \n  ENTERED this 15th day of November, 2011. \n \n22 ",

Introduction  \nUnder  the  Compromise  and  Settlement  Agreement  (CSA)  reached  by  the  Oklahoma \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS) and Children’s Rights in D.G. vs. Yarborough, Case No. 08-\nCV-074, DHS and Children’s Rights identified a common desire for performance improvement in \na range of areas selected to improve services and outcomes for children in the care and custody \nof Oklahoma’s child welfare system. Under the CSA, the Co-Neutrals are required to provide \ncommentary twice annually on DHS’ overall progress in improving its child welfare system and \non DHS’ efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward targeted outcomes in \nspecific performance areas. With respect to commentaries, the Co-Neutrals are first charged, \nunder the CSA, with determining if DHS’ performance data is sufficient to accurately measure \nDHS’ progress. \nOn October 23, 2013, the Co-Neutrals issued a report providing initial commentary on DHS’ \ndata sufficiency for four performance areas involving: foster homes; shelter use; caseworker \nvisits with children in DHS custody; and maltreatment of children in DHS custody. In this report, \nthe Co-Neutrals continue the data sufficiency assessment begun in the October 2013 report \nand discuss the status of the Co-Neutrals’ efforts to determine the adequacy of DHS’ data for \nthe remaining three performance categories: caseloads, placement stability and permanency.  \nFurther, this report includes the Co-Neutrals’ assessment of performance and progress, as well \nas judgments in certain areas as to whether DHS has made “good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress toward each Target Outcome” as stated in the CSA.  \nTo prepare this report, the Co-Neutrals conducted a series of verification activities to further \nevaluate DHS’ progress in implementing its commitments. These activities included regular \nmeetings with DHS leadership, private agency leadership and child welfare stakeholders. The \nCo-Neutrals met with hundreds of DHS caseworkers and supervisors in 24 offices across 14 \ncounties; conducted focus groups with foster parents; visited seven group homes across five \ncounties and conducted more than a dozen announced and unannounced visits to children’s \nshelters in Oklahoma, Tulsa and five other counties. The Co-Neutrals visited and discussed \nreform efforts with the leadership of the Office of Client Advocacy, the centralized hotline, the \nDHS  Continuous  Quality  Improvement  (DCQI)  staff,  and  conducted  extensive  reviews  of \nindividual children’s case records, children’s maltreatment investigations, shelter census logs, \nfoster home studies and other documentation. During office visits, the Co-Neutrals interviewed \nstaff and supervisors and talked to public and private managers about the pace, progress, and \nchallenges of the reform work. The Co-Neutrals also reviewed and analyzed a wide range of \naggregate and detail data produced by DHS, and reviewed policies, memos, and other internal \ninformation relevant to DHS’ work during the period. Throughout, the Co-Neutrals have been \nimpressed  by  the  commitment  of  DHS  caseworkers  and  supervisors  to  strengthen  the \n3 \n \n\n \nOklahoma child welfare system so that it works better for children and families, although the \nDHS staff bear an enormous burden trying to do so in the face of very high caseloads and a \nshortage of safe, family-like placements for children. \nThe remainder of this report includes:  \n  Background (Section II); and \n  Seven Performance Categories: Data Sufficiency, Progress and Good Faith (Section III). \nII.  Background   \nOn January 4, 2012, DHS and Children’s Rights reached an agreement in a long-standing federal \nclass action lawsuit against the State of Oklahoma on behalf of children in the child welfare \ncustody of DHS. That matter, D.G. vs. Yarborough, Case No. 08-CV-074, resulted in the CSA, \nwhich was approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma \non February 29, 2012. Under the CSA, the parties identified and the court approved Eileen \nCrummy, Kathleen Noonan and Kevin Ryan as “Co-Neutrals,” and charged them to evaluate and \nrender judgment about the ongoing performance of DHS to strengthen its child welfare system \nto better meet the needs of vulnerable children, youth and families. The CSA gave DHS the \nopportunity to develop and present for the Co-Neutrals’ approval a comprehensive reform \nplan. DHS, with the assistance of state leaders, advocates and other stakeholders, developed \nthe Pinnacle Plan, a five-year roadmap of significant commitments beginning in State Fiscal Year \n(SFY) 2013, also referred to as Year One. The Plan was approved by the Co-Neutrals on July 25, \n2012. Further, the CSA charged DHS with identifying baselines and target outcomes to measure \nand report the state’s progress in core performance areas – henceforth referred to as the \n“seven performance categories” – which are: \n  Maltreatment (abuse and neglect) of children in the state’s legal custody (MIC); \n  Development of foster homes and therapeutic treatment foster homes (TFCs); \n  Regular and consistent visitation of caseworkers with children in the state’s legal \ncustody; \n  Reduction in the number of children in shelters; \n  Placement stability, reducing the number of moves a child experiences while in the \nstate’s legal custody; \n  Child permanency,  through reunification, adoption or guardianship; and \n  Manageable caseloads for child welfare staff. \nAs required by the CSA, the Co-Neutrals and DHS established the Metrics, Baselines and Targets \nplan (the “Metrics Plan”) on March 7, 2013. The CSA further requires the Co-Neutrals to provide \n4 \n \n\n \ncomments and to issue a determination as to whether DHS’ data submissions provide sufficient \ninformation to accurately measure the Department’s progress. Pursuant to the CSA, the Co-\nNeutrals may revise any determination of data sufficiency based on subsequent or ongoing data \nsubmissions as deemed appropriate.  \nFor each of the seven performance categories, the Metrics Plan establishes: the methodology \nfor the performance metrics and measuring progress; parameters for setting baselines; interim \nand final performance targets and outcomes; and the frequency by which DHS must report data \nand information to the Co-Neutrals and the public. The Metrics Plan identified a total of 35 \nmetrics based on the seven performance areas.  In July 2013, DHS began reporting data for four \nperformance  categories:  maltreatment  in  care,  foster  homes  and  TFCs,  shelters  and \ncaseworker-child visits. DHS began reporting data in January 2014 for the remaining three \nperformance categories: caseloads, placement stability and permanency.  Appendix A provides \nan update on DHS’ data reporting schedule as well as the status of four metrics (of the 35 \nindicated above) in the Metrics Plan for which the Co-Neutrals and DHS are continuing to work \nto finalize a target and/or baseline.  Appendix B provides a summary chart of all the baselines \nand targets established in the Metrics Plan.  \nIn this period of reform, as the Co-Neutrals draw judgments about DHS’ efforts to achieve \nsubstantial  and  sustained progress,  much  of the  analysis  centers  on the  activities  of DHS \nleadership to  improve the  conditions that  will  make  it  possible  for DHS  caseworkers  and \nsupervisors to better care for children. The standard set forth in the CSA – “good faith efforts to \nachieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress”  requires  more  than  an  assessment  of  DHS’ \nintentions but necessarily requires a conclusion by the Co-Neutrals that is based on an analysis \nof the activities undertaken and decisions made by the state to accomplish a target or goal and \nthe impact of those decisions and activities on achieving substantial and sustained progress as \ndefined in the CSA, the Pinnacle Plan and the Metrics Plan.  \nIII.  Seven Performance Categories: Assessment of Data Sufficiency, Progress and \nGood Faith Efforts \nIn this section of the commentary, the Co-Neutrals review the seven performance categories \nunder the CSA, commenting on: the sufficiency of data presented to the Co-Neutrals and DHS’ \nefforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward targeted outcomes.  \nFrom the beginning of DHS’ reform efforts, the Co-Neutrals have encouraged DHS to sequence \nits implementation of the Pinnacle Plan with an initial, intense focus on three areas – reducing \ncaseloads so that staff have the time and capacity to care for children; increasing the supply of \nfoster homes so that children who have been separated from their families have safe and \n5 \n \n\n \nappropriate places to live; and reducing the use of shelter care, especially for young children \nand infants. To achieve substantial and sustained progress toward targeted outcomes in all \nperformance categories, it is essential that DHS first achieve substantial and sustained progress \nin reducing caseloads and increasing its pool of safe, diverse and stable foster homes. All child \nwelfare systems must have a solid foundation of manageable caseloads and a sufficient number \nof foster homes to meet the diverse needs of children and to promote their safety, permanency \nand well-being.  \nTo  fully  assess  DHS’  reform  progress,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  and  consider  the \ninterconnected impact of each of the seven performance categories on one another and not \nreview progress of any one area in a vacuum. As such, the Co-Neutrals again want to reiterate \nthat the cross-metric impact of having a robust pool of foster homes and manageable caseloads \ncannot be underestimated. These areas in particular represent the two foundational pillars for \nreform, upon which all other areas of the CSA performance categories, as well as reforms \nidentified in the Pinnacle Plan, will rest.  \nDHS has encountered a number of formidable challenges in implementing this reform effort.  \nAs has been widely reported, DHS has experienced a surge in the number of children placed in \nDHS’ custody, a trend underway and noticeable at the time the Pinnacle Plan was submitted by \nDHS and approved.1  \nThe Co-Neutrals highlighted in the October 2013 report that DHS placed a great deal of its \nresources reorganizing the reporting structure of its child welfare system, which has been a \nwide-scale undertaking. In fact, the system and personnel changes were so significant that \nsome of the instability in the system now is a result of these modifications, including the \npromotion of a large cohort of caseworkers into supervisor positions. These types of broad \nrange system changes that occur at the start of serious child welfare reform efforts often take \ntime to settle and allow managers and workers at all levels to experience the positive results \nintended for better outcomes.  \nA.  Foster Care and Therapeutic Foster Care Homes \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish targets for the number of foster homes available for \nchildren, including children in need of therapeutic care (CSA Section 2.10). To make necessary \nprogress and develop an adequate supply of homes for children, DHS identified and committed \nto a set of strategies in its Pinnacle Plan. By virtue of the parties’ CSA, the Co-Neutrals are \n                                                           \n1 A recent expert report by Casey Family Programs highlights the various factors contributing to the increase in \nplacements.    \n6 \n \n\n \nauthorized to verify and confirm a baseline of available homes and establish performance \ntargets for improvement. \nYear Two (SFY14) Foster Home Baselines and Targets \nIn January 2014, at the Co-Neutrals’ request, DHS submitted a point-in-time baseline of all \nfoster homes, including kinship, tribal, traditional and non-traditional foster homes that were \nopen and available for children on July 1, 2013. As the Co-Neutrals reviewed that data, DHS \ndiscovered a flaw in the January submission and re-submitted the data in March 2014.  \nThe Co-Neutrals reviewed the most recent submission and focused analysis on foster homes as \ndescribed  in  their  first  commentary:  non-therapeutic  traditional,  contracted,  shelter  and \nemergency homes. The July 1, 2013 data shows that DHS had 1,704 homes available on that \ndate. Of those 1,704 homes, the data indicates that less than three percent of the homes had \nbeen vacant for more than six months and one percent had been vacant for more than a year. \nFollowing the Co-Neutrals’ review and analysis of DHS submissions and extensive interactions \nwith DHS, the Co-Neutrals conclude that the data is sufficient to establish a baseline of 1,704 \nfoster homes on July 1, 2013.  \nDHS acknowledged in its Pinnacle Plan that, \n“Oklahoma  needs  new  and  innovative  ways  to  recruit,  retain  and  support \nresource families. Stable families provide children with experiences they need \nfor  healthy  development  in  all  aspects  of  life  including  social,  physical  and \nemotional well-being. Every child deserves to be with a family that meets his or \nher  safety,  permanency  and  well-being  needs.  Each  child  in  out-of-home \nplacement should be matched with a family that keeps him or her with siblings \nand close to home and community.”  \nOver the past two years, the Co-Neutrals have reviewed hundreds of pages of DHS information \nand data, and convened numerous meetings with DHS leadership and staff, Children’s Rights, \nfoster parents, private agencies and other system partners to understand the scope of the need \nfor safe foster homes and therapeutic foster homes across Oklahoma.  \nConsistent themes that emerged include: DHS is struggling to keep up with the growing needs \nof  children  in  care;  foster  parents  often  receive  minimal  or  inaccurate  information  when \nchildren are placed, hampering the foster parent’s ability to meet the child’s needs; and many \nworker caseloads are excessive, having a negative impact on staff’s ability to share ongoing \ninformation  and  respond  to requests for  assistance.  Concerns  were  expressed  about  high \nworker turnover and lack of coordination between primary and secondary workers as it impacts \n7 \n \n\n \nboth the children and foster parents. Foster parents raised questions regarding the new public-\nprivate foster care system that requires communication between DHS and its public agency \nfoster parents. Finally, foster parents shared that board rate increases are important to provide \nneeded services for children, particularly for kinship families who are called upon to care for \nchildren at a moment’s notice without the opportunity to plan for the responsibilities of caring \nfor a child. \nThe perspective universally shared in these meetings, underscored by data and information \nfrom DHS, is that the number of foster homes and therapeutic foster homes is inadequate to \nmeet the needs of children in Oklahoma’s child welfare system. Consistently, the Co-Neutrals \nwere  informed  in  meetings  with  hundreds  of  caseworkers  and  supervisors  that  DHS \ncaseworkers routinely experience great difficulty finding and accessing appropriate foster and \ntherapeutic foster homes for children. \nAs noted in the Co-Neutrals’ October 2013 report, DHS had been employing a practice of asking \nkinship families to care for non-kinship children on an emergency basis, with no prior approval \nas a traditional home, and often without adequate time to prepare for the placement of a non-\nkinship child. DHS responded to the Co-Neutrals’ concerns about converting kinship homes to \ntraditional homes and moved quickly to develop protocols that guide staff in assessing a kinship \nfamily’s readiness and capacity to provide care for non-kinship children. DHS developed similar \nprotocols  to  planfully  convert  adoptive  homes  to  traditional  foster  homes.  DHS  recently \nimplemented these protocols and the Co-Neutrals will continue to monitor DHS’ process for \ntransitioning kinship and adoptive homes to traditional foster homes. \nFoster Home Development and Support \nDHS reported early in the development of the Pinnacle Plan that public sector resources were \nstrained due to the growing number of children in foster care. To develop and support more \nfoster homes, DHS implemented a set of short-term strategies while it developed a longer-term \nreconceptualization of its business model for recruiting, assessing, supporting and certifying \nfoster  homes.  In  2012  and  continuing  through  2013,  DHS  approved  staff  overtime,  hired \ntemporary staff, rehired retirees and contracted with vendors to complete foster care home \nstudies. Additionally, DHS increased the availability of foster parent pre-service trainings in \norder to increase convenience and options for families. As articulated in its Pinnacle Plan, DHS’ \nchief longer-term strategy involved the privatization of non-kin foster home development and \nsupport. DHS planned to continue to manage the pool of public agency foster homes that it had \nalready developed and to utilize those homes for children’s placements. Moving forward, DHS \narticulated that private agencies would develop and support new foster homes after contracts \n8 \n \n\n \nwere awarded, creating a bifurcated foster care system that would require close coordination \nbetween DHS and private agencies. \nIn order to select the private agencies authorized to undertake this work with foster homes, \nDHS committed in its Pinnacle Plan to administer a contract bidding process through the \nissuance  of  a  Request  for  Proposals  (RFP)  with  the  bidding  process  to  be  completed  by \nSeptember 30, 2012. However, DHS did not post the RFP on the state’s Central Purchasing \nwebsite until October 29, 2012 with a proposal deadline of December 3, 2012, two months late. \nThroughout the RFP process, bidders expressed concerns to DHS leadership regarding what \nthey believed to be a lack of bidder input concerning RFP outcomes, unrealistic performance \nmetrics and fiscal penalties for agencies if certain performance targets were missed.  One \nhundred  twenty  proposals  were  submitted  in  response  to  the  RFP  and  DHS  selected  ten \nagencies to provide foster care services in 26 of its 29 child welfare districts.  \nOn April 12, 2013, DHS leadership cancelled the ten contracts, believing its longer-term goals \nidentified  in  the  Pinnacle  Plan  would  be  compromised  by  the  awards.  In  its  notice  of \ncancellation to the contracted agencies, DHS explained that its original RFP language was too \nprescriptive  and  worked  against  provider  creativity,  flexibility  and  capability.  DHS  further \nobserved that the service regions of the state had been artificially defined and worked against \nthe reality of how foster homes could be recruited and supported. DHS expressed concern that \na number of high quality agencies had been eliminated in the process and that providers did \nnot have an opportunity to provide input in the design and details of the contracts. \nDHS then implemented another contracting process that allowed the Department to include \ninput from providers, with performance outcomes negotiated with agencies and with the focus \non strong public-private partnerships. In August 2013, contracts were awarded to four agencies \nto provide foster care services statewide, eleven months after the state’s commitment to do so \nin the Pinnacle Plan. DHS charged its private partners to develop 1,197 homes between August \n2013–July 2014 and the Co-Neutrals accepted and adopted this performance goal as the DHS \ntarget outcome for the development of new non-relative foster homes in SFY14.  \nContracting with private agencies to provide foster care services impacts all child welfare \nsystem partners, including prospective foster parents, existing foster parents, and DHS staff. \nDue to the scale and importance of this system change, thoughtful transition planning was \ncritical to execute effective implementation. The Co-Neutrals have reviewed the new contracts \nand meeting notes between the private agencies and DHS staff; met with leadership of each of \nthe private agencies and with foster parents in focus groups in Tulsa and Oklahoma County; and \ninquired about the transition process in meetings with DHS staff.  The Co-Neutrals have not \nfound sufficient evidence that an adequate transition plan was developed and implemented. As \nan example, the new contracts did not include start-up time for private agencies to adequately \n9 \n \n\n \ndevelop capacity to undertake the new work. Once the contracts were awarded, DHS quickly \nbegan  sending  new  inquiries  from  prospective  foster  parents  to  the  contracted  private \nagencies, while the foster care agencies were just beginning to recruit, train and hire new staff \nand, in some cases, set up new office space. Not surprisingly, the transition period proved \ndifficult, as evidenced by the very low number of homes (25) developed and approved by the \ncontracted agencies from August-December 2013.  \nAs of December 31, 2013, DHS reported developing 345 new homes, or 29 percent of the SFY14 \ntarget of 1,197 new homes. Twenty-five of these 345 new homes were developed under the \nnew private contracts, as noted above, while DHS developed the other 320 homes in-house \nbetween July-December 2013. DHS completed the approval process for the 320 new homes as \nthey were already well through the DHS approval process at the time the private agency \ncontracts were finalized in August 2013.  \nIn the October 2013 Commentary, the Co-Neutrals also established a net gain target of 615 \nfoster homes for SFY14. The Co-Neutrals worked with DHS to establish a written methodology \nfor calculating net gain/loss (see Appendix C). DHS’ net gain/loss analysis indicates that the \nDepartment had 1,704 open foster homes on July 1, 2013 and 1,754 open foster homes on \nDecember 31, 2013, for a net gain of 50 foster homes, eight percent of the target for SFY14.2 \nThe Co-Neutrals have evaluated the pace, quality and progress of DHS’ efforts to achieve these \ntarget outcomes and conclude the Department’s work does not represent good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward these target outcomes. \nFoster Care Board Rate Increase \nMonthly foster care reimbursement rates cover the cost of caring for a child, including food, \nclothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies and personal incidentals. In the Pinnacle \nPlan, DHS committed to increase foster care board payments incrementally to more closely \nalign  with national  “Hitting  the MARC”3  standards  published  in 2007 and  to  increase  the \nnumber of available safe placements for children. The following table represents the board rate \n                                                           \n2Of the homes open on July 1, 2013, 306 were closed as of December 31, 2013. Of the homes open on December \n31, 2013, 356 opened after July 1, 2013. \n3In October 2007 Children’s Rights, The National Foster Parent Association and the University of Maryland School \nof Social Work released a state-by-state analysis of the cost of supporting children in foster care. The report, \nHitting the MARC (Minimum Adequate Rates for Children), identified deficiencies and disparities amongst states \nand proposed a standard rate for each state to use in fulfilling the federal requirement to provide foster parents \nwith payments to cover the basic needs of children in foster care, including food, shelter, clothing and school \nsupplies. \n \n10 \n \n\n \nincreases to which DHS committed as a central strategy to achieve its targets in the above-\nreferenced performance areas: \nTable 1: Monthly Foster Care Reimbursement Rates \nAge  SFY12  SFY13  SFY14  SFY15  SFY16  SFY17 \n0-5  $365.00  $403.48  $441.97  $480.45  $518.94  $557.42 \n6-12  $430.00  $471.78  $513.57  $555.35  $597.14  $638.92 \n13+  $498.33  $538.73  $579.13  $619.53  $659.93  $700.33 \n \nThe first board rate increase was implemented in SFY13. However, the second annual increase \nhad not been implemented as of March 31, 2014, which DHS attributes to an insufficient \nappropriation from the Legislature. DHS requested a supplemental budget appropriation from \nthe  Legislature  that  includes  funding  for  the  SFY14  increase,  but  the  Legislature  had  not \nsupported the request as of March 31, 2014. DHS has indicated it intends to implement a 6.25% \nresource home rate increase this spring, and then provide another 6.25% rate increase effective \nJuly  1,  assuming  its  Pinnacle  Plan  appropriation  request  for  SFY15  is  supported  by  the \nLegislature. DHS believes the strategy is adequate to support its effort to achieve the target \noutcomes in this area. \nTherapeutic Foster Care \nThe Co-Neutrals’ previously set a target of 150 new therapeutic foster care homes (TFC) in \nSFY14. The Co-Neutrals’ October 2013 commentary cited DHS data showing that by the end of \nSFY13, there were 586 TFC homes open as of June 30, 2013 and that almost 50 percent (282 \nhomes) had no children placed in them.  \nThe revised baseline data submitted by DHS in March 2014 indicates that 548 TFCs were open \non July 1, 2013. Of these 548 TFCs, 102 homes were “joint approved,” meaning they were \nauthorized to provide at least one type of regular foster care as well as therapeutic foster care. \nAs such, 446 of the open TFCs were approved for TFC placements only. As of December 31, \n2013, DHS has approved 56 new therapeutic foster homes, or 37 percent of the target.  \nThough DHS’ revised data for July 1, 2013 shows fewer TFCs as vacant – not fostering any \nchildren – than the data DHS supplied to the Co-Neutrals for the October 2013 commentary, \nvacancy rates are still high compared to regular foster care and relative to reports of demand \nfrom DHS staff. On July 1, 2013, DHS’ data indicates that of homes licensed as TFCs only (not \njoint approved), 28% had been vacant at least six months and 18% had been vacant for more \n11 \n \n\n \nthan a year. As of December 31, 2013, 26% of homes approved as TFCs only had been vacant at \nleast six months and 20% of TFC-only homes had been vacant for more than one year.4  \nThe Co-Neutrals did not set a target for TFC net gain/loss in SFY14, but have calculated this \nnumber to bring transparency to the continuum of available placements for children. DHS \nreports 548 approved TFCs on July 1, 2013 and 547 approved TFCs on December 31, 2013, for a \nnet loss of one TFC home during the first half of SFY14.  \nThe Co-Neutrals discussed the challenges around therapeutic foster care with DHS leadership, \nwith  the  appropriate  DHS  management  staff,  with  providers  and  with  caseworkers  and \nsupervisors  charged to find  appropriate placements for  children  in  care.  In  light of these \ndiscussions and the low number of therapeutic homes licensed through December 31, 2013, \nthe Co-Neutrals are not convinced that DHS presently has in place an adequate process to meet \nthe target outcome for additional TFCs, nor its Pinnacle Plan commitment to match children’s \nindividual needs with available and appropriate placements and to maximize the available \nsupply of existing homes. On March 21, 2014, DHS submitted a plan to the Co-Neutrals, which is \ncurrently under review.   \nBased on a review of DHS’ pace and progress to achieve the target outcome for developing new \nTFC homes, the Co-Neutrals do not conclude that the Department’s work represents good faith \nefforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the target outcomes. \nB.  Caseworker Caseloads and Supervisor Workloads \nThe  CSA  requires  that  DHS  establish  performance  targets  for  caseworker  caseloads  and \nsupervisor workloads (CSA Section 2.10). As noted in the October 2013 report, DHS’ ability to \nachieve progress in the most critical areas of reform hinges on reducing worker caseloads. \nUnder the Pinnacle Plan, DHS committed to the following caseload standards: \n                                                           \n4 Vacancy rates for jointly approved TFC homes are far lower: of the 102 jointly approved homes on July 1, 2013, \nfour percent had been vacant for at least six months, and two percent for at least one year. These homes may be \noccupied by children in regular foster care or in therapeutic foster care. Of the 115 jointly approved homes on \nDecember 31, 2013, six percent had been vacant for at least six months and one percent for at least one year. \n12 \n \n\n \nTable 2: Pinnacle Plan Caseload and Workload Standard Commitments \nRole  Standards  Weight Per Case \nCPS  12 Open Investigations or Assessments  0.0833 \nOCA  12 Open Investigations  0.0833 \nFamily Centered Services  8 Families  0.125 \nPermanency Planning  15 Children  0.0667 \nResource  22 Families  0.0455 \nAdoption  8 Families & 8 Children  0.0625 \nSupervisors   1 Supervisor Dedicated to 5 Workers   0.2 per worker \n \nCaseworker Caseloads and Data Sufficiency \nThe Pinnacle Plan identified a variety of activities to reduce caseworker turnover and improve \nthe overall working conditions for the DHS workforce so they can better care for and meet the \nneeds of children. These commitments include adopting a graduated workload assignment for \nnew workers so that they would not receive a full caseload until nine months after completing \nCORE training and committing to “incrementally increase pay for child welfare staff so that \nsalaries are more competitive with other states.” Finally, DHS committed to implement a 1:5 \nsupervisor  to  caseworker  workload  ratio  to  ensure  caseworkers  receive  the  support  and \nguidance they need, which is most critical for new workers. \nThe Metrics Plan  codified  targets  for the  caseload  standards  and  for  the  supervisor  ratio \nidentified in the Pinnacle Plan. One of DHS’ first steps to achieve these targets was to develop \nan accurate way to count caseloads. Counting a caseload for staff who have a single role and \nwho work full-time in that role is straightforward. Counting a caseload for staff with mixed \ncaseloads and responsibilities other than casework is more difficult. As counting caseloads is \ncomplex, the Co-Neutrals have employed an iterative process in working with DHS to develop \nan appropriate methodology.  \nAt  the  Co-Neutrals’  request,  DHS  submitted  detailed  caseworker  caseload  information  for \nDecember 31, 2013. The point-in-time data submission for caseloads and workloads was well \norganized, and DHS quickly answered the Co-Neutrals’ questions and concerns. However, the \nmethodology currently used by DHS does not account for graduated assignments for the many \nnew staff at DHS, does not yet account for all appropriate secondary work and does not take \ninto account non-titled supervisors who spend a portion of their time supervising caseworkers. \nAs such, the Co-Neutrals will continue to work with DHS on these outstanding issues and will \nassess data sufficiency in this area in the next report.  \n13 \n \n\n \nThe Co-Neutrals will reserve judgment until the October 2014 report on whether DHS has \nexhibited good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward its caseload \ntarget outcomes. At this juncture, relying only on the Department’s preliminary data, described \nin  Table  3,  the  Co-Neutrals  do  not  yet  find  evidence  that  workloads  are  improving  in  a \nsubstantial  and  sustained  direction  and  DHS  will  need  to  demonstrate  very  significant \nmovement over the next several months. \nTable 3: Metrics Plan Caseload5 Baselines and Targets \nBaseline  Interim Targets for  Caseloads Reported \nCompliance Measure \n12/31/13  for 12/31/13 \nMeet \n27%  45%  Meet  35% Meet \n(100% or below standard) \nClose \n8%  30% Close  9% Close \n(1-20% above standard) \nOver \n65%  25% Over   57% Over  \n(20% or more above standard) \nSupervisor Workloads and Data Sufficiency \nIn  January  2014, the  Co-Neutrals  approved  a methodology  for  counting  the  workloads of \ncaseload carrying supervisors (Appendix B). DHS presented the Co-Neutrals with data showing \nthe compliance status of 260 supervisors as of December 31, 2013. In reviewing this supervisor \nworkload data, the Co-Neutrals found that 78 supervisors carried 636 cases. As approved by the \nCo-Neutrals, DHS did not assign any case weight to the 40 supervisors who carried two or fewer \ncases.6  Thus,  only  38  supervisors  were  counted  as  case-carrying  in  determining  workload \ncompliance. Of these 38 supervisors, 21 carried more than half of a caseload. Of those 21, six \nhad a total workload that was twice the standard and of those six, three had a total workload \nfour times the standard. \nThe Co-Neutrals identified and DHS confirmed that 16 units, comprised of 55 caseworkers, did \nnot have a titled supervisor (a “CWS IV”) in place. Instead, the 16 units had managers serving as \nsupervisors or had a senior caseworker fill that role. DHS did not include those staff in their \n                                                           \n5 The caseloads referenced in the baseline, targets and performance data represent an aggregate of all caseload-\ncarrying worker types (permanency, CPS, family centered services, foster care/Bridge and adoption) combined, \ncalculating each worker’s compliance with his/her own caseload standard. The Co-Neutrals have concluded that \nnot all required worker standards in the Pinnacle Plan (e.g., graduated assignments and 50% caseload standard for \ncaseworker mentors) are reflected in the point in time performance data for December 31, 2013 and will need to \nbe resolved and integrated into the methodology used prospectively for counting caseloads. \n6 At any point in time, supervisors can have one or two new incoming cases assigned to them in the transition \nperiod of receiving the new case in their unit and prior to assigning the responsibility for the case to a caseworker.  \n14 \n \n\n \ncompliance calculations and the Co-Neutrals have requested that DHS propose how best to \nreflect the supervisory work of these individuals.   \nDHS’  preliminary  and  unverified  data  as  of  December  31,  2013  shows  that  66.15%  of \nsupervisors met the workload standard, 15.38% were close and 18.46% were over the standard. \nDHS agreed to reach 90% of supervisors meeting the workload standard by June 30, 2014. The \nCo-Neutrals and DHS are still in the process of establishing a baseline for supervisor workloads. \nDHS  continues  the  process  of  working  through  all  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  its \ncalculations are complete, such as accounting for unsupervised units of workers. As such, the \nCo-Neutrals will continue to work with DHS on these outstanding issues and will assess data \nsufficiency in this area in the next report.  \nC.  Shelter Use \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets related to shelters (CSA Sec. 2.10). In \nthe Pinnacle Plan, DHS committed that it would “ensure all children are cared for in family-like \nsettings” and “stop its use of temporary placement in shelters for all children under 13 years of \nage.” \nIn addition, DHS made specific commitments to children of different age groups related to \nshelters including: \n \n  By December 31, 2012, all children under two years of age will be placed in family-like \nsettings;  \n  By June 30, 2013, all children under six years of age will be placed in family-like settings;  \n  By June 30, 2014, all children under 13 years of age will be placed in family-like settings; \nand  \n  By June 30, 2014, children ages 13 years of age and older may be placed in a shelter, \nonly if a family-like setting is unavailable to meet their needs.  \n \nIn the Metrics Plan, the number of “child-nights” spent in shelters was chosen as the metric to \nassess Oklahoma’s progress in eliminating shelter use. One “child-night” is defined as “one child \nin a shelter at midnight.” The total number of child-nights is calculated by summing the number \nof children in shelters at midnight for each night of the reporting period.  \nThe Metrics Plan identified the baselines and targets for each of the above metrics except for \nchildren age 13 and older. The Co-Neutrals and DHS finalized a target for shelter placements \nand nights for children age 13 and older using a dual variable metric:  the first variable is based \non a percentage reduction in the total number of child-nights and the second variable is based \non the rule established in the Pinnacle Plan Section 1.17, which states that,  \n15 \n \n\n \n“By June 30, 2014, children ages 13 years of age and older may be placed in a \nshelter, only if a family-like setting is unavailable to meet their needs. Children \nshall not be placed in a shelter more than one time within a 12-month period \nand for no more than 30 days in any 12-month period. Exceptions must be rare \nand  must  be  approved  by  the  deputy  director  for  the  respective  region, \ndocumented in the child’s case file, reported to the division director no later \nthan the following business day, and reported to the OKDHS Director and the Co-\nNeutrals monthly.”   \nThis metric assumes that there will continue to be a need to place older children in congregate \nsettings but the target ultimately focuses on reducing child-nights in a shelter for children ages \n13 and older by more than 50% and ensuring Pinnacle Plan Section 1.17 is followed to limit the \nnumber of times and length of stay a child experiences in a shelter, when a family-like or other \nsetting that best meets a child’s needs is not available.  \nTable 4: Baselines and Targets by Age, DHS Shelter Use \nAge  Baseline  Interim Target and  Final Target  Final Target Date \nDate \n0 to 1  2,923 child- None set  0 nights  12/31/2012 \nnights \n2 to 5  8,853 child- None set  0 nights  6/30/2013 \nnights \n6 to 12  20,147 child- 50% reduction by  0 nights  6/30/2014 \nnights  12/31/2013 \n13 & Older  20,635 child- 1) 13,200 child- 1) 8,850 child- 6/30/2016 \nnights  nights  nights   \n2) 80% of children  2)90% of children \nplaced will meet  placed meet \nPinnacle Plan 1.17  Pinnacle Plan 1.17 \nby 6/30/2015 \n \nShelter Utilization and Data Sufficiency  \nIn the October 2013 commentary, the Co-Neutrals reported that after reviewing a number of \ndata sources – the KIDS database, available shelter logs maintained by individual shelters, and \nDHS’ monthly shelter report – a small discrepancy was detected in the number of children \nexperiencing shelter placement between the shelter data reported to the Co-Neutrals and the \npublic,  and  the  data  sources  noted  above.  DHS  explained  that  the  discrepancies  existed \nbecause they needed more time to ensure all relevant data was entered into the KIDS system \nand verified. The Co-Neutrals and DHS subsequently agreed to additional “data lag time” as \ndiscussed in Appendix A. The Co-Neutrals thereafter conducted a comparison review of DHS \n16 \n \n\n \nshelter data reports provided to the Co-Neutrals and shelter entry and exit logs maintained in \nthe KIDS system and found that the data is consistent. Given this, the Co-Neutrals find that the \nshelter data produced by OKDHS is sufficient.  \nSubstantial and Sustained Progress and Good Faith Efforts \nThe first shelter deadline per the Metrics Plan established that no children under the age of 2 \nwould be placed in a shelter after December 31, 2012.7  At the time of this first shelter deadline \nfor children under 2, an average of 35 children that age entered shelters each of the prior three \nmonths of October-December 2012.  \nFor the first few months into 2013, DHS worked hard to meet this commitment. However, given \nthe undersupply of foster homes, even for this small number of children, DHS was not able to \nsustain its progress and meet this target. The Co-Neutrals heard regularly through focus groups \nwith hundreds of staff around the state about the lack of available placements for all children, a \nproblem confounded by the delay in the RFP process. Moreover, the Co-Neutrals’ own review \nof records in 2013 found that while a smaller number of children under the age of 2 were being \nplaced in shelters, DHS was continuing its practice of removing children and placing them in \nsome type of temporary arrangement before they could be moved to a permanent kinship or \nfoster care home.  \nAs of April 2013, DHS reported and the monthly data showed that OKDHS could not sustain its \nreduction in child-nights in the shelters. Over the following months, the number of children \nunder the age of 2 in shelters increased as did the total shelter nights experienced (from a low \nof seven child-nights in March 2013 up to 117 child-nights in September 2013).  \nDHS leadership has instituted a pre-authorization process whereby caseworkers must work \nwith their supervisors and local and regional managers to explore, exhaust and document all \noptions available to place a child in a foster or kinship home. This process started on December \n31, 2012 for children under 2, and started on March 1, 2013 for any child under 6. This \ninformation is documented on an authorization form that must be approved by the child \nwelfare director before DHS places a child under the age of  2 in a shelter. DHS Regional \nDirectors must approve the placement of children ages 2-5 years old in shelters.  This additional \nprocess is meant to ensure family-like placement options are considered first before a child is \nsent to a shelter. However, given that DHS has not produced nearly as many new foster homes \n                                                           \n7 A Note about Shelter Exceptions:  The Pinnacle Plan allows DHS to place young children in shelters if they are part \nof a large sibling group. DHS had also been placing children in shelters as an exception if they had “complex \nmedical needs.”  DHS informed the Co-Neutrals that it will no longer consider the latter an exception to shelter \nplacement. \n17 \n \n\n \nas planned, caseworkers are often still in the position of having to place children in a shelter \nbecause of a lack of available foster homes.  \nThe Co-Neutrals reviewed 88 shelter pre-authorization forms submitted for children under the \nage of 6 between October 2013 and February 2014. The 88 forms covered many more children \nthan this, since many had two or more siblings. Of the 88 pre-authorizations submitted, 58 \nwere for new placements and 30 were for placement disruptions.  There were many cases in \nwhich reasonable efforts were made to consider kinship placements before removal.  However, \nin 21 of the 88 cases reviewed, including 7 cases that involved either a joint response with the \npolice or an independent police removal, kinship resources were either not considered or were \nidentified but not pursued to avoid shelter placement. The Co-Neutrals noticed that kin were \nautomatically  ruled  out  in  some  of  these  cases  if  there  was  anyone  alleged  to  be \nundocumented in the house, if one of the parents had child welfare involvement as a child or if \nthe relative had some income limitations. In these cases, reasonable efforts to place with kin \nseemed to stop. In 15 of the 30 cases that involved a placement disruption, the foster or kinship \nparent’s inability to handle a behavior problem and/or lack of availability of a TFC was noted in \nthe shelter form.  \nDHS conducted its own qualitative review on shelter usage for children under 6 between \nOctober and December 2013 and generated a similar set of findings, including the need for \nbetter  planning  related  to  placement  disruptions  and  the  importance  of  looking  into  all \navailable family-setting options before a decision is made to use a shelter. For each of these \nrecommendations,  a  key  conclusion is  the  need  for  DHS to think  more  proactively about \nplacement resources before a child is removed or once removal occurs.  \nThe second shelter deadline per the Metrics Plan established that no children under the age of \n6 would be placed in a shelter after June 30, 2013. DHS reported and the data showed the same \npattern for children in this age group as experienced with younger children:  the first few \nmonths after the deadline saw a steady decline in the number of children and shelter nights \nthrough March 2013 before an upward trend through September 2013 (from a low of 493 child-\nnights in March 2013 to 777 child-nights in September).  \nStill, for both age groups, DHS has demonstrated a decline in the number of child nights from \nthe baseline established in the Metrics Plan as shown in Table 5. \n18 \n \n\n \nTable 5: DHS Shelter Use April-Sept. 2013 and Change from Baseline \nDHS Shelter Use  Baseline   Performance  Change (n)  Change (%) \nby Age  (Jan 2012-June2013)  (Apr 2013-Sept 2013) \n0 to 1  2,923  784  -2,139  -73.0% \n2 to 5  8,853  4,679  -4,174  -47.0% \n6 to 12  20,147  22,337  2,190  11.0% \n13 & Older  20,635  24,486  3,851  19.0% \nTOTAL  52,558  52,286  -272  -0.5% \n \nAlthough DHS has not achieved the targets set in the Pinnacle Plan of no child-nights for either \nchildren under the age of 2, or for children under the age of 6, the use of shelter placements for \nyoung children has declined substantially to date under this reform effort.  \nDHS re-committed to the Co-Neutrals that there would be no young children under the age of 2 \nin shelters by March 31, 2014, and no young children under the age of 6 in shelters by June 30, \n2014. DHS’ preliminary data suggests that shelter placement for children under the age of 2 is \nvery low (6 children in March 2014 – 4 of whom met the exception for placement with a sibling \ngroup of 4 or more children). DHS believes that this new effort can be sustained because they \nare recruiting new resource homes with a priority of using them first to place young children.  \nThe deadline for eliminating shelter placements of children aged 6 through 12 is June 30, 2014. \nIn an effort to track and work towards a phased decrease in the number of children ages 6 \nthrough 12 entering shelters, DHS and the Co-Neutrals set an interim target for this group in \nthe Metrics Plan. This interim target was set for December 31, 2013 with DHS reducing by 50% \nthe total number of child-nights experienced in the six-month baseline period from January-\nJune 2013. The established baseline is 20,147 shelter nights. Unfortunately, DHS did not reach a \n50% reduction in the interim target of 10,073 shelter nights but, in fact, saw a marked increase \nfor this age group to 23,384 shelter nights during the period of July-December 2013.  \nFurther, DHS does not appear to be on track to meet the final target and deadline set for June \n30, 2014, as the number of children (ages 6 to 12) being placed in shelters is still rising. There is \na similar upward trend for children 13 years of age and older.  \nThe Co-Neutrals remain very concerned about the growing number of shelter placements for \nchildren ages 6 and older, especially because the use of shelters seems based not only on a lack \nof resource homes, but – as noted above – on a practice norm of only looking for resources \nafter a decision for removal has been made. This practice will have to evolve in order for DHS to \nfulfill its Pinnacle Plan commitment of “matching” children to appropriate placements from the \ntime of a first placement.  \n19 \n \n\n \nDespite concerns regarding shelter placements of older children, the Co-Neutrals find that DHS \nhas made good faith efforts to achieve substantial progress toward the target outcome of \neliminating shelter placement for children under the age of 2 years. This finding is based on the \nCo-Neutrals’ review of DHS activities and performance data as well as interviews with staff in \noffices  across  Oklahoma  and  on-site  interviews  and  observations  at the  shelters.  The  Co-\nNeutrals cannot yet conclude if this progress has been “sustained” and will continue to monitor \nthis issue and include an update in the next report. The Co-Neutrals will reserve judgment until \ntheir next report on whether DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and \nsustained progress toward the target outcome of eliminating shelter placements for children \nbetween 2 and 5 years of age, and will also continue to monitor shelter utilization for older \nchildren. \nD.  Child Maltreatment in Care (MIC) \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets to reduce abuse and neglect of \nchildren in DHS’ custody (CSA Section 2.10). As the Co-Neutrals previously reported, DHS has \ninitiated a number of meaningful reforms to align its investigative response to alleged abuse \nand neglect for children in DHS’ custody, regardless of placement type. To assess the safety of \nchildren in DHS’ custody, Oklahoma is tracking and reporting the number of children abused or \nneglected  in  two  categories  based  on  the  type  of  perpetrator.  The  first  are  alternative \ncaregivers:  a foster parent,  therapeutic  foster parent,  kinship  parent, or  institutional  staff \nperson (all referred to as resource caregivers). The second is abuse or neglect by a parent while \nthe child is in DHS’ custody. \nWith regard to the first, DHS and the Co-Neutrals agreed DHS would improve safety for children \nin care using two indicators. First, DHS now tracks and reports publicly the number of children \nabused or neglected by an alternative caregiver, on a monthly basis. Second, DHS and the Co-\nNeutrals use the federal metric “Absence of Child Abuse and/or Neglect in Foster Care,” which \nincludes the percent of all children in foster care during a 12-month period who were not \nvictims of substantiated abuse or maltreatment by a foster parent or facility staff. The 12-\nmonth period coincides with the federal fiscal year, October 1 to September 30. \n  MIC and Data Sufficiency \nDHS, along with all other state child welfare systems, annually submits (in January) a Child \nMaltreatment Report to the federal government, which is aggregated with other states’ data in \nthe  National  Child  Abuse  and  Neglect  Data  System  (NCANDS).  In  the  Pinnacle  Plan,  DHS \ncommitted to include in its Federal Fiscal Year 2013 (FFY13) report to the federal government \nmaltreatment of all children in custody substantiated by the DHS Office of Client Advocacy \n(OCA). The Co-Neutrals are in the process of verifying that commitment and will disclose their \n20 \n \n\n \nfindings in the next report.  \nDuring the Co-Neutrals’ verification, some questions about the data emerged, which led DHS to \nconclude that it had over-reported to the Co-Neutrals and the public instances of child abuse \nand neglect in institutional settings, including some children who were not in DHS’ legal custody \nat the time they suffered maltreatment. That discovery raised doubts for the Co-Neutrals about \nthe integrity of the historical data previously supplied by DHS in 2013, which the Co-Neutrals \nrelied upon to  establish both the performance baselines and the target outcomes in this \nperformance area. DHS and the Co-Neutrals concluded that the historical data submitted by \nDHS and used by the Co-Neutrals to establish the baseline had not been subject to any internal \nverification by DHS over the years, and that the detailed information supporting the baseline \nwas  not  available  for  review.  As  a  result,  the  Co-Neutrals  are  formally  withdrawing  the \npreviously published baselines and targets in this performance category, and will be working \nwith  DHS  over  the  next  several  months to  establish  new baselines  and targets  based  on \nvalidated data. The Co-Neutrals will publish these new standards in the next report. \nE.  Caseworker Visitation  \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets for two measures on caseworker visits \n(CSA Section 2.10): the frequency of caseworker visits, which is defined as the number of \nrequired monthly visits completed with children in care; and, continuity of visits by the same \ncaseworker. At this time, DHS is only required to report on the frequency of caseworker visits. \nFor frequency of visits, the Metrics Plan establishes that DHS will report the following: \n“3.1 The percentage of the total minimum number of required monthly face-to-\nface contacts that took place during the reporting period between caseworkers \nand children in foster care for at least 1 calendar month during the reporting \nperiod.”  \nThe  second  indicator  is  the  same,  but  includes  only  visits  made  by  primary  case- \nworkers: \n“3.2 The percentage of the total minimum number of required monthly face-to-\nface  contacts  that  took  place  during  the  reporting  period  between  primary \ncaseworkers and children in foster care for at least 1 calendar month during the \nreporting period.” \nDHS and the Co-Neutrals agreed that DHS would not begin recording data on continuity of visits \nuntil January 2014, with reporting to begin in July 2014. \n21 \n \n\n \nAs  reflected  in  the  Metrics  Plan,  DHS  and  the  Co-Neutrals  agreed  that  it  would  not  be \nreasonable to establish a baseline and measurable targets for continuity of visits while the state \nwas phasing out the use of secondary workers whose responsibilities include conducting the \nrequired monthly child visits. DHS committed to end the use of secondary workers across the \nstate by January 2014; however, the Co-Neutrals approved DHS’ request to postpone this target \ndate  until  July  1,  2014.  This  delay  may  affect  the  Co-Neutrals’  ability  to  provide  a  final \nassessment of DHS’ efforts to achieve progress in providing children in care continuity of visits \nwith the same primary caseworker.  \nCaseworker Visits and Data Sufficiency \nIn the October 2013 Commentary, the Co-Neutrals deemed DHS’ data to be sufficient to assess \nDHS’  progress  for  the  frequency  of  caseworker  visits.  At  the  Co-Neutrals’  request,  DHS \nsubmitted caseworker visitation data for FFY13 in March 2014. The Co-Neutrals are currently \nengaged in a set of verification activities on this data and will reserve judgment on DHS’ efforts \nto achieve substantial and sustained progress until the next report.  \nF.  Placement Stability \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets to provide stability of placements for \nchildren in DHS’ custody (CSA Sec. 2.10) as DHS and Children’s Rights agree that children should \nhave  as  few  placement  changes  as  possible  during  their  time  in  foster  care.  Placement \ninstability causes trauma for children and is associated with increased behavioral challenges \nand poor educational and health outcomes.  \nThe Co-Neutrals and DHS agreed to use the federal Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System \n(AFCARS) files and definitions for placement moves in calculating placement stability metrics. \nDHS presented the Co-Neutrals with its FFY13 AFCARS files, which draw data from DHS’ KIDS \nsystem and contain information on children who spent time in foster care from October 2012 \nthrough September 2013. \nTo verify the accuracy of children’s placement moves in the AFCARS files, the Co-Neutrals \nreviewed the records in the KIDS child welfare database for 78 children who entered DHS foster \ncare  in  the  month  of  October  2012  and  who  experienced  two  placements  during  FFY13 \naccording to the AFCARS files. The Co-Neutrals are currently engaged in a set of verification \nactivities on this data and will reserve judgment on DHS’ efforts to achieve substantial and \nsustained progress until the next report. The Co-Neutrals’ ongoing review seeks to determine if \nplacement moves were accurately recorded in the KIDS fields that are used to count placement \nmoves in AFCARS. Children with two placement moves were selected for the review because \n22 \n \n\n \none unrecorded placement would change their status from compliant to noncompliant with \nmetric 4.1, which measures, in part: \n4.1:  Percent of children in the legal custody of OKDHS that experience two or \nfewer placement settings: \na.   Of all children served in foster care during the year who \nwere in care for at least 8 days but less than 12 months, the \npercentage that had two or fewer placement settings. (4.1 \n(b) and (c) are outlined below in Table 5.)   \nIn December 2013, DHS and the Co-Neutrals finalized a baseline and target for Metric 4.2 in the \nMetrics Plan, which measures: \n4.2: Of those children in foster care for more than 12 months, the percent of \nchildren who experienced two or fewer placements settings after their first 12 \nmonths in care. \n \nThe  following  table  includes  the  full  listing  of  the  baselines,  targets  and  current \nperformance reported for 4.1 and 4.2:8 \n \nTable 6: Placement Stability Baselines, Targets and Current Performance \nMetric  Baseline  Target  Performance \nOct 2011-Sept 2012 June 30, 2016  Oct 2012-Sept 2013 \n4.1(a): % of children in custody with 2 or fewer  70.0%  88.0%  72.9% \nplacements: in care less than 12 months   \n4.1(b): percent of children in custody with 2 or fewer 50.0%  68.0%  50.8% \nplacements who are in care more than 12 months   \nbut less than 24 months \n4.1(c): percent of children in custody with 2 or fewer 23.0%  42.0%  24.8% \nplacements who are in care at least 24 months   \n4.2: percent of children in care more than 12  74.0%   88.0%   74.6% \nmonths, with 2 or fewer placements after their 12  (Apr.‘12–Mar.‘13) \nmonths in care \n                                                           \n8 The Metrics Plan includes a third metric for placement stability (4.3) that would measure placement changes that \nrepresent moves toward permanency. DHS and the Co-Neutrals worked to develop DHS’ capacity to produce this \nmeasure. Due to the range of placement types in KIDS and the complexity of defining a “move to permanency” \nwith existing data, developing the metric required significant time from DHS analytic staff. To allow DHS to focus \non the three priority areas identified by the Co-Neutrals (caseloads, foster homes and shelters), the Co-Neutrals \nsuspended reporting requirements on metric 4.3 and may revisit working with DHS to establish this measure at a \nlater date.  \n23 \n \n\n \nPlacement Stability and Data Sufficiency \nAs of the time of the preparation of this report, the Co-Neutrals were still in the process of \nassessing the sufficiency of DHS’ placement stability data. The Co-Neutrals will continue this \nreview in conjunction with DHS and provide further comment on the data for this performance \narea in the October 2014 report.  \nG.  Permanency \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets for achieving permanency for children \nand to do so in a timely manner (CSA Section 2.10). DHS and the Co-Neutrals agreed that \npermanency  for  children  will  be  defined  as  reunification,  adoption  or  guardianship  and \nestablished a suite of metrics to assess DHS’ progress in moving children to permanency. These \nmetrics are listed in the following table.  \n \nTable 7: Permanency Metrics, Baselines, Targets and Performance Reported by DHS \n Metric  Baseline  Target   Performance \nJune 30, 2016   \n6.1: Of children who are legally free not living in an adoptive  Jan 10, 2014 Cohort   TBD  TBD \nplacement as of Jan. 10, 20149, the percent to achieve  292 children \npermanency.   \n6.2(a): children who entered care 12-18 months prior to end  Data due: 9/30/13  Total – 55.0%  Total – 31.8% \nof report period, the % to reach permanency within 1 year of   \nremoval – by type of permanency  Total – 35.0% \n   Reunification - 31.4% \n   Adoption - 1.6% \n   Guardianship – 2.0% \n6.2(b): children who entered 12th month in care 12-18  Data due: 9/30/13  Total – 75.0%  Total – 41.0% \nmonths prior to end of report period - % to reach   \npermanency within 2 years of removal, by type of  Total - 43.9% \npermanency     Reunification - 22.3% \n   Adoption - 18.9% \n   Guardianship - 2.7% \n6.2(c): children who entered 24th month in care 12-18  48.5%  Total – 70.0%  Total – 46.9% \nmonths prior to end of report period - % to reach   \npermanency within 3 years of removal, by type of  a) Reunification - 13.0% \npermanency  b) Adoption - 32.7% \nc) Guardianship - 2.9% \n                                                           \n9 The Metrics Plan established the point-in-time date of March 7, 2013 as when the cohort for this metric would be \nestablished. DHS required additional time to work through how best to define and capture this cohort given some \ncomplexities with DHS’ data system and ongoing work to ensure accuracy of the data maintained in the KIDS \nsystem.  \n24 \n \n\n \n Metric  Baseline  Target   Performance \nJune 30, 2016   \n6.2(d): children who entered 36th month in care 12-18  46.6%  Total – 55.0%   Total – 48.5% \nmonths prior to end of report period - % to reach     \npermanency within 4 years of removal, by type of  a) Reunification - 8.8% \npermanency  b) Adoption - 37.3% \n  c) Guardianship - .4% \n6.3: of children discharged in 12 month period prior to report  Total-10.3%    8.2%  10.0% \nperiod, % who re-enter care during  with 12 months after \ndischarge \n6.4:  of legally free foster children who turn 16 during 24-36  30.0%   50.0%   31.4% \nmonth prior to report period, (a)% to exit to permanency by    by 12/31/14 \nage 18, (b) % to stay in care after age 18 and (c) % to exit  a) Exit to perm =   \nwithout permanency by 18  30.43%  75%  \n  b) Stayed in care =  by 12/31/15 \nBaseline Period: 7/1/09 to 6/30/10  2.72%  80%  \nc) Exit w/o perm =  by 6/30/16 \n66.85% \n6.5: of children who become legally free for adoption in the  54.3%  75.0%   60.9% \n12 months prior to the year of reporting period, % discharged  (AFCARS for FFY12)  6/30/16 \nto finalized adoption in less than 12 months from date of   \nbecoming legally free \n6.6: % of adoptions to not disrupt over a 12 month period, of  97.1%  97.3%  96.7% \nall trial adopt placements during previous 12 months \n6.7: % of children with finalized adoption over a 24 month  99.0%  99.0%  99.5% \nperiod whose adoption did not dissolve with 24 months of \nfinalization \nDHS made progress toward reaching data sufficiency for several permanency metrics, \nparticularly metrics 6.1 and 6.7.  \nMetric 6.1 Achieving Permanency for Legally Free Children \nThe Metrics Plan requires DHS to identify a cohort of children in foster care who were legally \nfree for adoption but for whom no adoptive placement had been identified. The cohort was to \nbe identified as of March 7, 2013, the day the Metrics Plan was approved. At that time, KIDS did \nnot have a reliable indicator for legally free children in this status. DHS field and analytic staff \nworked to improve data quality in this area throughout the fall of 2013 and the Co-Neutrals \ndirected DHS to draw the cohort as of January 10, 2014. DHS then submitted a cohort of 292 \nlegally free children with no identified adoptive placement. The Co-Neutrals deem the data \nsubmitted sufficient to calculate metric 6.1 and approve the cohort of 292 children.  \nMetric 6.7 Adoption Dissolution \nDHS submitted calculations and detailed data for this metric in January 2014. After analyzing \nthis information, the Co-Neutrals clarified the calculation methodology for the metric. DHS \n25 \n \n\n \nresubmitted their calculations and supporting data. After analyzing this information, the Co-\nNeutrals deem the data submitted sufficient to calculate metric 6.7.  \nAs of the time of the preparation of this report, the Co-Neutrals continued to work with DHS on \ndata sufficiency for the permanency metrics beyond 6.1 and 6.7, for which the Co-Neutrals \nhave determined data sufficiency, and will render a judgment on the remaining permanency \nmetrics in the next commentary. \n26 \n \n\n \nAppendix A:Performance Metrics and Reporting Schedule \n \nAt the time the Metrics Plan was finalized in March 2013, a number of baselines and targets \nremained outstanding. DHS and the Co-Neutrals have since worked through an iterative process \nto finalize many more of the unresolved baselines and targets as DHS continues to refine and \nensure accuracy and consistency in its data collection and reporting.  \nOnly four out of 35 metrics included in the Metrics Plan still require a target and/or baseline: \nsupervisor workloads require a baseline (data submitted in February 2014 is currently under \nreview); continuity of caseworker visits for six consecutive months requires a baseline and \ntarget, which are due to be set by December 31, 2014 (Metric 3.3(b)); MIC requires a new \nbaseline and target (see Section III, D of this April 2014 Commentary); and a target will be set \nfor permanency for children legally free as of January 10, 2014 (Metric 6.1). \nAppendix B is a summary table of the baselines and targets embedded in the Metrics Plan.  \nDHS requested additional time to report data for the four performance areas it reports every \nmonth. The Co-Neutrals have reinforced with DHS that taking the necessary time to ensure \naccuracy in DHS’ data reporting is essential to allow the Co-Neutrals, the public, and most \nimportantly, DHS to assess the progress of its work and reform efforts.  \nDHS requested additional time to account for the period between when workers are scheduled \nto input information into the data systems and when the central data team extracts the \ninformation and prepares it for reporting to the Co-Neutrals and the public. With respect to \nfoster homes, TFCs, shelter utilization and caseworker child visits, the Co-Neutrals considered it \na reasonable request to allow DHS 60 days in its effort to develop data accuracy and provide \nDHS staff more time to enter, verify and prepare the data for public reporting and DHS’ own \nanalysis.  \nFor maltreatment of children in care (MIC), DHS originally requested in April 2013 to have 90 \ndays to report final determinations of substantiated abuse/neglect of children in DHS custody \non a monthly basis. DHS subsequently requested an additional time lag of 180 days, which the \nCo-Neutrals declined.  \nData Reporting Frequency \nDHS will continue to produce data reports every month during the life of the CSA. Under the \nMetrics Plan, DHS will include data on maltreatment in care, foster homes and TFCs, shelters \nand caseworker-child visits in every monthly report. Every three months (quarterly: January, \nApril, July and October), DHS will include caseload data in the monthly report and, semi-\n27 \n \n\n \nannually (January and July), DHS will include data for placement stability and permanency in its \nmonthly reports.  \n28 \n \n\n \nAppendix B:Metric Plan Baselines and Targets \n \nOklahoma Department of Human Services \nCompromise and Settlement Agreement in D.G. v.

A resource family only counts once even if they have \napprovals in multiple “countable categories”. \n \n4.  Open Resource Family – Any resource family that has at least one resource type \ncontained in one of the agreed upon “countable categories” as defined in the \nmeasurement plan.   \na.  The date on which a resource family is considered open depends on the type of \nhome: \ni.  When approved by OKDHS staff, resource families are open as of the \nfamily assessment “supervisor approval” date in KIDS. \nii.  When approved by contracted agencies, resource families are open as of \nthe “open date” in KIDS as a DHS supervisor does not approve these \nhomes.  \n \n                                                           \n10 Per the Approved Baselines, Metrics and Targets plan, the Co-Neutrals will determine if emergency foster care \nand shelter host homes will be counted in future baselines and targets.  \n37 \n \n\n \nNote: A resource family is considered “open” even if a resource type is closed during the \nperiod under review as long as at least one resource type remains open in a countable \ncategory. \n \n5.  Closed Resource Family – Any resource family in which all countable resource types \nhave a close date during the period under review. The resource family is considered \nclosed even if the resource family is licensed in non-countable categories. \n \nMethod of counting net change in resource families: \n1.  Baseline count of resource families: On the first day of the period under review, the \nnumber of resource families with at least one open resource type in a “countable \ncategory”. \n \n2.  Current count of resource families: On the last day of the period under review, the \nnumber of resource families with at least one open resource type in a “countable \ncategory”. \n \n3.  The net change is the baseline count of resource families subtracted from the current \ncount of resource families.  \n \n4.  In reporting the net change in resource families, the Department will provide the \nbaseline count, the current count, the number of closures, and the number of openings.  \n \na.  Closures are defined as resource families included in the baseline count but not \nincluded in the current count.   \nNote: the number of closures in this section is not the number of times a \nresource family opens and closes during the reporting period. \nb.  Openings are defined as resource families included in the current count but not \nincluded in the baseline count.   \nNote: the number of closures in this section is not the number of new resource \nfamilies recruited for foster care as previously defined by the Co-Neutrals.  \n \n5.  The Department will provide in separate spreadsheets detailed information on resource \nfamilies that were part of the baseline count and current count, as has been provided in \nprior submissions.   \n \na.  The baseline detail will include an indicator for resource families that were \nclosed as of the current count. The current count detail will include an indicator \nfor resource families that were open as of the current count but not as of the \nbaseline count.  Of the latter group, a separate indicator will identify homes \ncounted under the criteria toward the target of new homes developed.    \n \n38 \n ",

Introduction   \nOn January 4, 2012, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) and Plaintiffs reached \nagreement in a long-standing federal class action lawsuit against the State of Oklahoma on \nbehalf of children in the custody of DHS due to abuse and neglect by a parent or guardian. That \nmatter, D.G. vs. Yarborough, Case No. 08-CV-074, resulted in the Compromise and Settlement \nAgreement (CSA), which was approved by the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Oklahoma on February 29, 2012. Under the CSA, the parties identified and the court \napproved Eileen Crummy, Kathleen Noonan, and Kevin Ryan as “Co-Neutrals,” and charged \nthem to evaluate and render judgment about the ongoing performance of DHS to strengthen its \nchild welfare system to better meet the needs of vulnerable children, youth, and families. The \nCSA  gave  DHS  the  opportunity  to  develop  and  present  for  the  Co-Neutrals’  approval  a \ncomprehensive reform plan. DHS, with the assistance of state leaders, advocates, and other \nstakeholders,  developed  the  Pinnacle  Plan,  which  contains  significant  commitments  to  be \nimplemented over a five-year period, beginning in State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2013. The Co-Neutrals \napproved the Pinnacle Plan on July 25, 2012.  \nThe CSA charged DHS with identifying baselines and Target Outcomes to measure and report \nthe  state’s  progress  in  core  performance  areas  –  henceforth  referred  to  as  the  “seven \nperformance categories” – which are: \n  Maltreatment (abuse and neglect) of children in the state’s legal custody (MIC); \n  Development of foster homes and therapeutic foster homes (TFCs); \n  Regular and consistent visitation of caseworkers with children in the state’s legal \ncustody; \n  Reduction in the number of children in shelters; \n  Placement stability, reducing the number of moves a child experiences while in the \nstate’s legal custody; \n  Child permanency, through reunification, adoption or guardianship; and, \n  Manageable caseloads for child welfare staff. \nAs required by the CSA, the Co-Neutrals and DHS established the Metrics, Baselines, and \nTargets  Plan  (the  “Metrics  Plan”)  on  March  7,  2013.  For  each  of  the  seven  performance \ncategories, the Metrics Plan establishes: the methodology for the performance metrics and \nmeasuring progress; parameters for setting baselines; interim and final performance targets \nand outcomes; and the frequency by which DHS must report data and information to the Co-\nNeutrals and the public.  Appendix A provides a summary chart of the metrics for the seven \n4 \n \n\nperformance areas, with corresponding baselines and targets, established by DHS and the Co-\nNeutrals, and updated through February 2015.1  \nThe CSA further requires the Co-Neutrals to provide commentary and issue a determination as \nto whether DHS’ data submissions provide sufficient information to accurately measure the \nDepartment’s progress. The Co-Neutrals have previously found data sufficiency for all the CSA \nperformance areas and data metrics.  Pursuant to the CSA, the Co-Neutrals may revise any \ndetermination of data sufficiency based on subsequent or ongoing data submissions as deemed \nappropriate.  \n \nThis document serves as the Co-Neutrals’ Fourth Commentary under the CSA and reflects DHS’ \nperformance, data, and information available through December 2014. In numerous instances, \nas described in this report, data and information are only available through September 30, 2014 \n(due to reporting lags or intervals agreed upon previously by the Co-Neutrals and DHS).  In \naddition, in some instances, the Co-Neutrals report on more recent decisions or activities by \nDHS to reflect, when possible, the most current view of the reform.  \nII.   Summary of Progress and Challenges Ahead \nWith more than two years into DHS’ implementation of its reform effort, DHS reports progress \nin  a  number  of  areas,  as  well  as  ongoing  challenges.    The  following  highlights  several \naccomplishments DHS achieved for Oklahoma’s children since the last report period: \n  DHS Commitment to Close the DHS-Operated Shelters in Tulsa and Oklahoma City: To \nfurther its commitment to place children in family-based settings, DHS announced, \nfollowing the end of this reporting period, plans to close the Pauline E. Mayer \nShelter in Oklahoma City and the Laura Dester Shelter in Tulsa by the end of 2015.  \n \n  Caseworker Visitation with Children by Primary Caseworker: DHS continues to report \nstrong performance in the area of caseworkers completing required monthly visits \nwith the children assigned to them. In fact, DHS reported that 96.6 percent of \nrequired  monthly  caseworker  visits  with  children  occurred  as  described  in  this \nreport.   Further,  DHS  continues  to  show  positive  trending  with  the  number  of \nmonthly visits conducted by a child’s assigned primary caseworker (77.2 percent), \n                                                           \n1 Under Section 2.10(f) of the CSA, the Co-Neutrals shall issue Baseline and Target Outcomes, which shall not be \nsubject to further review by either party but may at the discretion of the Co-Neutrals, after providing the parties \nan opportunity to comment, be revised by the Co-Neutrals. \n5 \n \n\nreflecting DHS’ ongoing commitment to minimize the use of secondary caseworkers \nto support children in DHS custody.  \n \n  Reducing the Number of Child Welfare Supervisors who Carry and Manage their Own \nCases:  DHS reported that as of December 31, 2014, 34 supervisors carried more \nthan two cases, which more than cuts in half the number reported for June 30, 2014, \nwhen 79 supervisors carried more than two cases.  Additional work remains for DHS \nto meet the 90 percent target of supervisor workload compliance and to further \nreduce the  number  of cases  managed by supervisors.  However,  DHS  is  making \nprogress in this area. \n \n  Reducing the Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigations Backlog: DHS developed \nand  implemented  a  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of  overdue  CPS  investigations, \neffectively cutting the backlog from 1,335 in mid-November 2014 to 1,062 at the \nend of December 2014.  As of March 23, 2015, DHS reported the backlog had been \nfurther reduced to 278 cases. \nThe Co-Neutrals observed, among others, the following challenges during this report period:   \n  Inadequate  Supply  of  Foster  and  Therapeutic  Foster  Homes  for  Children:  DHS \nunderstands  that  it  must  increase  the  number  of  available  foster  homes  and \ntherapeutic foster homes to meet the needs of children in care. During this reporting \nperiod,  approvals  for  both  types  of  homes  lagged  behind  the  monthly  pace \nnecessary to meet the annual and interim Target Outcomes.  \n \n  High Caseloads: DHS showed some modest progress in further reducing caseloads \nduring  the  period,  but  most  caseworkers  endeavor  to  perform  their  jobs  with \nexcessive caseloads. \n \n  Overuse of Shelters for Children Ages Thirteen and Older: The number of children \nages 13 and older in shelters continued to trend negatively above the baseline \nestablished at the beginning of the reform. During the first six months of 2012, \nchildren ages 13 and older spent a total of 20,635 nights in shelters, which increased \nto  25,108  nights  during  the  last  six  months  of  2014.   DHS  must  develop  the \nplacement resources and supports needed to care for these older children who \nlinger the longest in shelters. \n \n  \n \n6 \n \n\n  Permanency Delays:  For most of the metrics that track the timeliness of children \nachieving permanency, DHS’ performance has continued to trend negatively with \noutcomes worse than at the beginning of the reform.   \nThe CSA requires that the Co-Neutrals determine whether DHS has “made good faith efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress” toward a Target Outcome. This standard requires \nmore than an assessment of DHS’ intentions but necessarily requires a conclusion by the Co-\nNeutrals that is based on an analysis of the activities undertaken and decisions made by the \nstate  to  accomplish  a  target  or  goal  and  the  impact  of  those  decisions  and  activities  on \nachieving substantial and sustained progress as defined in the CSA, the Pinnacle Plan, and the \nMetrics Plan.  \nFundamental to this analysis is a clear understanding of the core strategies DHS has identified \nand implemented to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcomes.  \nAt the time of this writing, the Co-Neutrals observed DHS starting to modify earlier strategies \nthat have not resulted in progress, to make some necessary adjustments where possible, and to \ndevelop core strategies in certain performance areas.  DHS is in the process of analyzing which \nadditional core strategies should be employed for the balance of the performance areas under \nthe CSA and is expected to present those plans to the Co-Neutrals in the Spring of 2015.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Target Outcomes \nHas Made Good Faith \nHas Achieved \nEfforts to Achieve \nSustained, Positive \nHas Met Target  Substantial and  Page in \nMetric  Trending Toward \nOutcome  Sustained Progress  Report \nthe Target \nToward the Target \nOutcome \nOutcome \n1.

These  activities  included  regular \nmeetings  with  DHS  leadership  and  staff,  private  agency  leadership,  and  child  welfare \nstakeholders. In addition, the Co-Neutrals undertook announced and unannounced visits to \nchildren’s shelters. The Co-Neutrals also reviewed and analyzed a wide range of aggregate and \ndetailed data produced by DHS, and child and foster home records, policies, memos, and other \ninternal information relevant to DHS’ work during the period.  \nThe remainder of this report includes:  \n  Context Data of Children in DHS Custody (Section III); \n  Remedial Order (Section IV); \n12 \n \n\n  Seven Performance Categories: Assessment of Progress and Good Faith Efforts (Section \nV);  \n  Appendices; and, \n  Glossary of Acronyms. \nIII.  Context: Children in DHS Custody \nDemographics \n \nDHS reported there were 11,466 children in custody as of September 30, 2014 compared to \n11,063 children in custody on March 31, 2014.  During the reporting period from April 1, 2014 \nto September 30, 2014, 2,842 children entered care and 2,779 children exited care.2 \n \nYoung children aged zero to five years make up the largest portion of children in care (5,613 or \n49 percent). Children aged six to 12 years comprise 35 percent (4,021) of the population in care.  \nSixteen percent (1,832) are 13 years or older, as detailed in the following chart: \n \nFigure 1: Children in Care on September 30, 2014 by Age Group (Total = 11,466) \n13 or older  0 to 1 \n1,832   2,061 \n 16%  18% \n6 to 12  2 to 5 \n4,021  3,552 \n 35%  31% \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \n   \nWith regard to gender, the population is split almost equally — 51 percent male and 49 percent \nfemale.

Because of slight differences \nin reporting, adding the entries and subtracting the exits from the number of children in care as of the previous \nreporting period will not sum to the children in care at the end of this reporting period. \n13 \n \n\npercent  White,  and  eight  percent  Native  American.    In  addition,  17  percent  of  children \nidentified with Hispanic ethnicity (and can be of any race).  Twenty-eight percent identified with \nmultiple race and ethnicity categories, of which 73 percent identified as Native American.3   \n \nFigure 2: Children in Care on September 30, 2014 by Race (Total = 11,466) \nAfrican-\nAmerican \n9% \nMultiple race/ \nethnicity \n28% \nWhite \n38% \nHispanic \n17% \nNative \nAmerican   \n8%   \nSource: DHS Data \n \n \nAs presented in Figure 3 below, DHS’ data shows that of the children in care on September 30, \n2014, 43 percent (4,877) were in care for less than one year; 31 percent (3,533) between one \nand two years; 14 percent (1,594) between two and three years; ten percent (1,142) between \nthree and six years; and three percent (320) for more than six years. 4    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n3 Overall, 28 percent of children identified as Native American including those children who identified with more \nthan one race and ethnicity category. \n4 In Figures 3 and 4, percentages do not add up to 100 due to rounding. \n14 \n \n\nFigure 3: Children in Care on September 30, 2014 by Length of Stay (Total = 11,466) \n2-3 years \n1,594 \n3-6 years \n1-2 years  14% \n1,142 \n 3,533 \n 10% \n31% \n6+ years \n320 \nLess than one \n 3% \nyear \n4,877 \n \n 43% \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \n \nAs the following chart demonstrates, 91 percent of children in DHS’ custody live in family \nsettings, including with relatives (35 percent), foster families (43 percent), with their own \nparents (10 percent), and in homes that intend to adopt (four percent).

Remedial Order  \nSection 2.14 of the CSA vests the Co-Neutrals with the authority to require, at any time, that \nDHS undertake and maintain diagnostic and remedial activities for any performance area if the \nDepartment fails to achieve positive trending or begins to trend negatively.  On November 14, \n2014, the Co-Neutrals issued a Remedial Order5 directing DHS to undertake and maintain \ndiagnostic and remedial activities in three areas: 1) developing foster homes; 2) achieving \nmanageable caseloads; and 3) reducing a backlog of child abuse and neglect investigations. The \nRemedial Order requires DHS to identify core strategies to improve performance in each of \nthese areas.  Additional information and reports on progress related to the Remedial Order is \nincluded in the corresponding sections below on foster homes and caseloads.   \nV.  Seven Performance Categories: Assessment of Progress and Good Faith Efforts \nIn  this  section,  as  required  by  the  CSA,  the  Co-Neutrals  review  the  seven  performance \ncategories under the CSA, providing commentary on DHS’ overall progress and its efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward each Target Outcome. As described in Table \n1 (Summary of Target Outcomes) and Appendix A, not all performance categories and their \ncorresponding metrics have a Target Outcome that was due before the end of this reporting \nperiod (through December 31, 2014).    \nA.  Foster Care and Therapeutic Foster Care Homes \n \nIn the Pinnacle Plan, DHS agreed to develop a broad array of family-based placements sufficient \nto meet the needs of children in its custody. DHS committed to develop innovative strategies to \nrecruit, support and retain foster families and to streamline the foster home approval process. \nDHS acknowledged it must develop many more safe and stable family-based placements in \norder  to  meet  its  commitments  to  reduce  shelter  care  use,  ensure  child  safety,  improve \nplacement stability, and achieve positive permanency outcomes for children and youth. \nDHS faced many challenges throughout SFY14 as it transitioned to a new model of public-\nprivate agency partnerships for the recruitment of foster homes and failed to make substantial \nor sustained progress toward achieving the SFY14 Target Outcome to develop 1,197 new foster \nhomes.6  Now in SFY15, half way through the timeline set for the full implementation of the \nPinnacle  Plan,  DHS  has  pledged to  adopt  a  focused  set  of  core  strategies  to  significantly \nincrease the pool of foster and therapeutic homes available for the placement of children and \nyouth, which has not been accomplished over the last two years.  \n                                                           \n5 See Appendix B for the Remedial Order \n6 See Co-Neutral Commentary 3 for a full discussion of SFY14 performance. \n16 \n \n\nFoster Home Targets \nThe CSA requires that targets are established each year for the number of foster homes \ndeveloped for children, including children in need of therapeutic foster care. Under the CSA, the \nCo-Neutrals are authorized to verify and confirm a baseline of available homes and to establish \nDHS’ performance targets. In July 2014, after reviewing extensive information and data in the \ncontext of multiple discussions with DHS leadership, the Co-Neutrals established the SFY15 (July \n1, 2014-June 30, 2015) foster home target at 904 new non-kin foster homes.  The net gain \nfoster home target for this same period was established at 356 homes.7  \nOn November 14, 2014, to better track DHS’ progress in meeting the annual target, the Co-\nNeutrals established an interim target for foster homes: DHS must develop 678 new non-kin \nfoster homes by March 31, 2015.8 For future years, the Co-Neutrals will establish an annual \ninterim target (both date and target number to be determined) which will be based on the \nannual target established for the fiscal year.  (See Appendix C for the November 14, 2014 \nmemorandum that established the requirement for an annual interim target.) \nThe Co-Neutrals established the SFY15 criteria for new non kin-foster homes as follows:9  \n1.  A home certified for the first time as a foster home.  This includes homes certified at the \nsame time to be both an adoptive and foster home.  \n2.  A home newly certified as a foster home if the home is already approved as an adoptive \nhome.   \n3.  A home reopened or recertified as a foster home as long as the home has been closed \nas a foster home for more than twelve months.     \n4.  A  home  certified  as  a  kinship  home  that  is  then  reassessed  and/or  certified  as  a \ntraditional foster home resource open for non-kinship placements.  OKDHS must be able \nto identify these converted or dually certified homes in its reporting if the home existed \nas a kinship home within the past 12 months. \nThe SFY15 annual target of 904 new foster homes requires that DHS approve approximately 75 \nnew homes each month. During the first four months of SFY15, performance appeared to lag as \nDHS approved 274 new homes, approximately 69 new homes each month. (See Figure 5.)  DHS \nreported  to  the  Co-Neutrals  that  it  was  working  to  improve  performance  by  establishing \n                                                           \n7 Beginning in December 2014, DHS reported progress toward achieving the net gain target in its monthly public \nreport. \n8 DHS will report progress toward achieving the interim target for new non-kin foster homes in its monthly reports. \n9 The Co-Neutrals annually review these criteria and update them as appropriate. \n17 \n \n\nworkgroups  of  private  agency  and  foster  parent  representatives  to  identify  and  address \nsystemic  barriers  to  timely  foster  home  approval.  As  a  result,  DHS  reported  that  it  had \ncontracted for an electronic fingerprinting service to reduce wait times that persisted in its \nmanual fingerprinting process. DHS also reported that it discontinued DHS’ staff review of new \nprivate agency foster home studies for three of the four private agencies retained to recruit \nnew homes because the home reviews consistently met DHS review criteria and because the \nDHS secondary review slowed foster home approval. DHS further reported that, with the \nassistance of independent consultants, work had begun to develop a statewide recruitment \nplan that would be implemented by DHS and its private agency partners.  \nWhile DHS’ efforts early in SFY15 appeared to become more focused and collaborative with the \nprivate agencies, the Co-Neutrals were concerned that DHS had not developed the overall \ncapacity to recruit the number of foster homes sufficient to meet the needs of children and \nyouth in its care. The Co-Neutrals urged DHS to greatly expand its contracted foster home \ndevelopment work to additional providers and directed DHS to develop a plan that includes a \nset of core strategies to timely, substantially, and sustainably increase the number of available \nof foster and therapeutic foster homes. \nThe  Remedial  Order  issued  on  November  14,  2014  requires  DHS  to  adopt  a  set  of  core \nstrategies  in  a  remediation  plan  designed  to  catalyze  the  process  of  new  foster  home \ndevelopment.  DHS submitted its remediation plan to the Co-Neutrals on January 23, 2015 and \nthe Co-Neutrals conditionally10 approved the plan on February 6, 2015. DHS resubmitted a \nrevised plan on March 10, 2015, and the Co-Neutrals gave final approval of the plan on March \n12, 2015. \nIn the plan, DHS acknowledged that its decision to limit the 2013 RFP foster home contracts to \nfour agencies did not bring sufficient capacity to the system quickly enough. DHS has now \ncommitted to rapidly expand foster home recruitment contracts with one of the supported \nfoster care agencies and, for the first time, to contract for foster home development with youth \nservices agencies throughout Oklahoma.  DHS’ remediation plan states: \nDHS has contracted with private agencies for the recruitment and retention of \nresource families and established, along with providers, the recruitment goals for \nthe year.  Until recently, efforts were not producing an increased number of \ncertified  resource  families  at  a  pace  that  would  ensure  goal  achievement.  \nTherefore it is essential to evaluate and assess other options to ensure targets \nare met within established timeframes.  DHS will immediately expand the use of \n                                                           \n10 The Co-Neutrals requested that DHS submit additional data and information by March 10, 2015.  \n18 \n \n\ncurrent  contracts  and  will  immediately  contract  with  additional  providers  to \nexpand capacity.  These efforts are underway with a target date of March 1, \n2015 for the full execution of additional contracts.11 \nDHS also committed in the remediation plan for a senior level staff member to: \n  conduct weekly reviews of prospective foster homes engaged in the recruitment \nprocess with private agencies to assess the timeliness of home approval and to work \nwith agencies to reduce barriers as they are identified;  \n  to develop a statewide SFY16 recruitment plan, with the assistance of national \nexperts  and  in  collaboration  with  private  agency  partners,  to  assign  regional \nrecruitment  coordinators  who  will  partner  with  private  agencies  to  implement \ntargeted recruitment plans; and, \n  to contact foster families that exited in good standing within the last two years to \ndetermine  their  interest  in  fostering  and  to  implement  strategies  for  improved \ncustomer service.  \nDHS also agreed to utilize data to modify existing foster care contract requirements to ensure \nthat foster home recruitment is targeted to the populations of children in care who need \nhomes. DHS has also committed to improve supportive services available to foster families \nthrough an array of efforts. \nDHS has much work to do in the upcoming months to implement the commitments in the \nremediation plan, to timely address barriers and to demonstrate good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress toward the SFY15 Target Outcome of 904 new non-kin foster \nhomes. The Co-Neutrals will evaluate the quality, pace and progress of DHS’ efforts in the \nOctober 2015 Commentary and, for this reporting period, reserve judgment on DHS’ efforts to \nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward the SFY15 foster home Target Outcomes. \n \nSFY15 Foster Home Performance \nIn the first six months of SFY15, DHS and its private agency partners approved 447 new foster \nhomes.   \n                                                           \n11 From DHS’ January 23, 2015 Remedial Order, Foster Home Remediation Plan   \n19 \n \n\nFigure 5: New Foster Care Homes, July - December 2014 \n120 112 \n100\n88 \n80 71  Total new  \nhomes =  \n61  61 \n60 54  447 \n40\n20\n0\nJul-14 Aug-14 Sep-14 Oct-14 Nov-14 Dec-14\n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nThe private agencies approved 302 new homes (68 percent), and DHS approved 145 new \nhomes (32 percent). The private agencies made significant gains during the current period \ncompared to performance in SFY14, when they developed only 35 percent of all new foster \nhomes.  \nFigure 6: SFY15 New Foster Homes (Total = 447) \nPrivate \nAgency \n301 \n67% \nOther \n1 \nDHS \n.22% \n145 \n32% \n \n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nOf the 447 foster homes approved during the first half of SFY15, 248 families (55 percent) were \nnewly recruited by DHS and the private agencies.

Fifty–nine (13 percent) were DHS resource homes12 that were closed for more \nthan a year and reopened during the first six months of SFY15.13   \nFigure 7: SFY15 New Foster Home Types (Total = 447) \nKinship/ \nAdoption \nConversion \nNew  \n140 \n248 \n31% \n55% \nReopened \n59 \n13% \nSource: DHS Data \n \nSFY15 Net Gain Target and Performance \nThe Co-Neutrals established the SFY15 net gain Target Outcome of 356 foster homes and \nworked  with  DHS  to  establish  a  written  methodology  for  calculating  net  gain/loss.  DHS \npresented data showing that 1,907 foster homes were open on July 1, 2014 and 2,139 foster \nhomes were open on January 1, 2015 for a net gain of 232 foster homes in the first six months \nof SFY15.14   \nOf the 2,139 foster homes reported as open on January 1, 2015, 1,535 (72 percent) were \noccupied and 604 (28 percent) were vacant.15 DHS’ data further showed that of the 604 foster \nhomes vacant on January 1, 2015, 152 (25 percent) had been vacant at least six months, and 41 \nhomes (seven percent) had been vacant over one year.  The length of time these foster homes \n                                                           \n12 DHS resource homes that are reopened could have been previously approved as a number of different types of \nDHS resources, including traditional, kinship, emergency foster care, TFC and DDSD homes. \n13 Due to rounding, the percentages do not add up to 100. \n14 As of this report writing, DHS identified 149 contracted foster homes that appear in one or both baseline \ndatasets for June 30, 2014 and January 1, 2015. DHS determined that these homes are not available to any child in \nneed of a foster home placement and should be removed from the baseline data. DHS and the Co-Neutrals are \njointly reviewing DHS’ data and will provide an update in the October 2015 Commentary.     \n15 Seventy-two vacant foster homes were jointly approved as another type of resource (adoption, DDSD, etc.) and \nwere occupied by children in those resource types on January 1, 2015.  \n21 \n \n\nhave been vacant raises questions and concerns as it is widely acknowledged that there is not a \nsufficient pool of foster homes for children. \n \nThe Co-Neutrals also found that DHS’ data showed that a significant percentage of the homes \nreported vacant were also listed as unavailable for placements.  DHS and the Co-Neutrals \nreviewed this data and found that some data and program adjustments would be needed to \nensure that DHS’ data accurately shows which foster homes are open and available for child \nplacements  and  which  ones  should  be  closed  or  temporarily  tagged  as  unavailable  for \nplacements.   \n \nThe Co-Neutrals understand there are a number of reasons why a foster home would remain \nopen yet be registered as unavailable to accept placements for a short period of time. These \nreasons include foster parents needing time for medical care, vacations, changes in family \nstructure (e.g., birth or adoption of a child), home relocation, or if the home is experiencing a \nCPS investigation.  However, DHS shared with the Co-Neutrals that it had identified some \nchallenges with its child welfare data system (KIDS) that lead to inconsistencies in recording \nwhether foster homes are available or unavailable.  DHS understands the critical need to have \nan accurate picture of its pool of available foster homes, both to support caseworkers who at \nany moment are trying to place children in DHS’ foster homes and to establish appropriate \ntargets for developing the foster homes Oklahoma needs for children in DHS custody. \n \nAt the time of this report writing, DHS leadership had already begun to make changes in the \nKIDS system and provide guidance to all DHS foster care supervisors that will help establish a \nmore accurate record of those foster homes that are open and available to accept placements.  \nFurther, DHS and the Co-Neutrals are continuing a joint review of the foster home data as it \nrelates to homes reported as vacant and/or unavailable and the Co-Neutrals will provide an \nupdate regarding this review in their next Commentary. \n \nTherapeutic Foster Care \nDHS agreed to increase the number of therapeutic foster care (TFC) homes available to meet \nthe needs of children in its custody.  Children who are assessed to have behavioral health needs \nand who can live in the community with specially trained foster parents are eligible to be placed \nin TFC homes. DHS committed to develop a sufficient pool of TFC homes within the continuum \nof placement settings in order to avoid children’s placement in higher levels of congregate care, \nto step-down children from higher levels of care, and to ensure that appropriate services are \nprovided for children in need of behavioral health treatment.  \n22 \n \n\nIn advance of each state fiscal year, DHS committed to provide to the Co-Neutrals the agency’s \nproposed target for TFC home approval.  In setting the proposed target, DHS agreed to conduct \nan analysis of the children in placement who are in need of TFC homes as compared to available \nTFC homes to analyze how well existing capacity meets the projected need.  \nIn July 2014, DHS submitted to the Co-Neutrals its proposed TFC new home target for SFY15. \nDHS reported that it had analyzed available data and needed 196 new TFC homes statewide.  \nDHS reported that it continued to further analyze TFC home data and child waiting lists and \nproposed the target to be set at 150 new TFC homes, 75 percent of the identified need.  The \nCo-Neutrals accepted DHS’ proposal and established the SFY15 target at 150 new TFC homes \nwhich,  if  met,  would  be  a  35  percent  performance  improvement  over  SFY14  when  DHS \ndeveloped 111 new TFC homes.  \n \nAt the close of SFY14, DHS reported that 11 percent of TFC-only homes had been vacant for at \nleast six months.  The Co-Neutral’s raised concern in the October 2014 Commentary regarding \nthe high TFC vacancy rate and DHS’ monitoring of its TFC bed utilization. In order to bring focus \nto these issues, on November 14, 2014 and as provided for in Section 2.10 (f) of the CSA, the \nCo-Neutrals revised the Metrics, Baselines and Targets Plan (Metrics Plan) to include a net gain \ntarget and reporting requirements for TFC homes. \n \nTherapeutic Foster Care (TFC) homes - Annual Net Gain Target \nThe Metrics Plan establishes that “OKDHS shall establish targets for licensing new therapeutic \nhomes to be submitted to the Co-Neutrals by May 30th of each year.”   The Co-Neutrals require \nthat DHS also establish an annual net gain target for new TFC homes.16 \na.  For SFY15, the Co-Neutrals establish a net gain target of 56 TFC homes.  For future \nyears, DHS will submit to the Co-Neutrals proposed annual net gain targets for TFC \nhomes by May 30th of each year.  \nb.  Beginning in December 2014, DHS will report progress toward achieving the SFY15 \nnet gain target of new TFC homes in its monthly reports.   \n \nIn the first six months of SFY15, DHS reported that 63 new TFC homes were opened. DHS \nreported a net gain of 31 TFC homes with a baseline of 475 unique TFC homes open on July 1, \n2014 and 506 unique TFC homes open on January 1, 2015.17  In the second half of SFY15, DHS \n                                                           \n16 New TFC homes included in the net gain count are subject to the SFY15 Criteria for Counting New Non-Kin Foster \nand TFC Homes established by DHS and the Co-Neutrals. \n17 During the period, 37 TFCs closed, while 68 TFC homes opened during the period. \n23 \n \n\nmust make good faith efforts to accelerate performance and develop 87 additional TFC homes, \n(15 homes per month) to meet the SFY15 Target Outcome of 150 homes. \nSFY15 TFC Performance \nFigure 8: New Therapeutic Foster Homes, July - December 2014 \n14 13 \n12  12 \n12\n10 9  9 \nTotal new  \n8 \nhomes =  \n8\n63 \n6\n4\n2\n0\nJul-14 Aug-14 Sep-14 Oct-14 Nov-14 Dec-14\n \n   Source: DHS Data \n \nOver the past two years, DHS reported to the Co-Neutrals that it worked to improve data \nquality regarding the number of open and available TFC homes as well as the number of \nchildren requiring TFC placements. In recent discussions, DHS advised the Co-Neutrals that the \nhistorical TFC waiting list of 160-180 children continues to persist. At the same time, DHS \nadvised the Co-Neutrals that 185 TFC beds were open and available but were vacant.  When \nquestioned regarding how it is possible for a waiting list of up to 180 children to exist at the \nsame time 185 vacant beds are reportedly available, DHS acknowledged that there does not \ncurrently exist a systemic, routine process to manage bed utilization with the TFC agencies.  \nFurther, DHS confirmed that it had not conducted an analysis of its data to understand the \nproblem so that corrective steps could be taken.  Rather, DHS reported that when a home is \nlisted as vacant and available for 90 days or more, DHS staff contact the private agency and \ninquire about the status of the home. It is unclear to the Co-Neutrals, however, what action \nDHS takes either to ensure a vacant bed is filled or, when appropriate, to remove a home from \nthe list  of  available placements.   The  Co-Neutrals  conducted  their  own  data  analysis  and \n24 \n \n\ndetermined that there were 506 TFC homes open on January 1, 2015, of which 323 (64 percent) \nwere occupied and 183 (36 percent) were vacant.18  \n   \nFigure 9: Occupancy Rate of TFC Homes (Total = 506) \nVacant \n183 \n36% \nOccupied \n323 \n64% \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nOf the 183 TFC homes vacant on January 1, 2015, 79 (43.2 percent) had been vacant at least six \nmonths, and 37 homes (20 percent) had been vacant over a year.  Here too, as DHS reviews and \nworks to establish accuracy in how its foster care homes are listed as available or unavailable, it \nmust conduct the same close review to determine if the TFC  homes listed as vacant and \navailable or unavailable for extended periods are still viable or should be closed. \n   \nDHS reported to the Co-Neutrals that its focus in the first half of SFY15 was to increase \nreimbursements to TFC agencies, to work with TFC agencies to develop recruitment plans and \nto develop performance based contracts scheduled to be implemented with TFC agencies in \nSFY16.  DHS  reported  that  the  performance  based  contracts  are  meant  to  support  the \ndevelopment of new homes, the placement of teenagers, and the placement of children with \nhigher levels of behavioral and mental health acuity.  TFC agencies reported to the Co-Neutrals \nthat its work with DHS has been collaborative but that the recruitment of new TFC homes \ncontinues to lag.   As of the writing of this report, DHS has not yet identified, but indicates it \nwill, a set of core strategies and activities to address persistent problems in this performance \narea.  The Co-Neutrals conclude for this reporting period that DHS has not yet made good faith \nefforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress to achieve the Target Outcomes for TFC \nhomes. \n                                                           \n18 Twenty-five TFC homes are jointly approved and occupied as a non-TFC resource. \n25 \n \n\nThe Co-Neutrals have advised DHS to move with a sense of urgency to develop a core strategy \nplan in collaboration with TFC providers. The plan should be grounded in data and analysis to \nimprove TFC development, maximize bed utilization and eliminate child waiting lists. The Co-\nNeutrals expect DHS to submit the TFC core strategy plan in the Spring of 2015 for approval and \nto  implement  the  plan  when  approved.  The  Co-Neutrals  will  report  on  DHS’  efforts  to \nimplement the plan in the October 2015 Commentary. \nB.  Caseworker Caseloads and Supervisor Workloads \n \nPerformance Standards – Caseworker Caseloads19 \nThe CSA requires performance targets for caseworker caseloads and supervisor workloads (CSA \nSection 2.10). Under the Pinnacle Plan, DHS committed to the following caseload standards: \nTable 2: Pinnacle Plan Caseload and Workload Standard Commitments \nRole  Standards  Weight Per Case \nCPS  12 Open Investigations or Assessments  0.0833 \nOCA  12 Open Investigations  0.0833 \nFamily Centered Services  8 Families  0.125 \nPermanency Planning  15 Children  0.0667 \nResource  22 Families  0.0455 \nAdoption  8 Families & 8 Children  0.0625 \nSupervisors   1 Supervisor Dedicated to 5 Workers  0.2 per worker \nPerformance – Target Outcomes \nDHS reported that 34.2 percent of caseworkers met the established workload standard as of \nDecember 31, 2014, with 8.6 percent of workers close to the standard and 57.2 percent over \nthe workload standard.   \n                                                           \n19 The caseloads referenced in the baseline, targets, and performance data represent an aggregate of all caseload-\ncarrying worker types (permanency, CPS, family centered services, foster care/Bridge and adoption) combined, \ncalculating each worker’s compliance with his/her own caseload standard. \n26 \n \n\nFigure 10: Workers Meeting Workload Standards, December 31, 2014 \nClose \n8.6% \nMet \nOver \n34.2% \n57.2% \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nDHS committed to achieve a final target of 90 percent of caseworkers meeting workload \nstandards by June 30, 2014.  As presented in Figure 11 below, DHS did not meet this Target \nOutcome by either June 30, 2014 or December 31, 2014.   \nDHS’ caseload performance data, as of September 30, 2014, showed that DHS was trending \nslightly  negatively  against  the  starting  baseline  of  27  percent,  as  only  26.6  percent  of \ncaseworkers were meeting their caseload standard.  Shortly thereafter, the Co-Neutrals issued \nthe Remedial Order, which directed DHS to develop a staff tracking report that integrates key \ninformation, including current caseloads, number of workers needed to achieve 90 percent \ncaseload compliance, number of caseworker positions allocated and filled in each district, \nnumber of vacant positions, and other relevant factors. The Co-Neutrals also required that DHS \nidentify a set of “priority districts” with the greatest caseload challenges, vacant positions and \nstaff turnover.  Further, the Remedial Order directed DHS leadership to conference weekly with \nthe  district  directors  of  the  priority  districts  to  review  their  district’s  data  and  progress, \nchallenges and barriers with caseloads, hiring and retention. \nAt  the  close  of the  reporting  period, the  Co-Neutrals  observed  DHS  working  diligently to \nassemble the most rigorous (to date), data-informed, statewide hiring plan constructed by the \nagency during the past three years.  This work, which continues as of the writing of this report, \nintegrates  district-level  attrition  analysis  and  accounts  for  the  amount  of  time  DHS  has \ncommitted to offer newly hired staff before distributing a gradually increasing caseload to \nthem.  The document identifies which districts must hire what staff by when in order to bring \nDHS to 90 percent caseload compliance by the Summer of 2016. In this Commentary, the Co-\nNeutrals  reserve  judgment  on  DHS’  efforts  to  achieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress \ntoward the caseload Target Outcomes in order to give the agency additional time to implement \n27 \n \n\nthe hiring plan as created.  The Co-Neutrals will draw future judgments based in large part on \nan  analysis  of  DHS’  efforts  to  implement  the  hiring  plan,  including  overcoming  systemic \nbarriers, proactively recruiting staff, improving retention and streamlining hiring processes.  \n  Figure 11: Worker Caseloads: Percent of Workers Meeting Workload \nStandards \n \n70% 65.0% \n62.2% \n57.2% \n60%\n50%\n40% 34.2% \n27.0%  27.8% \n30%\n20%\n10.0% \n8.0%  8.6% \n10%\n0%  \nBaseline 30-Jun-14 3 1-Dec-14\n \n \n% Met % Over % Close Source: DHS Data \n \nPerformance Standards and Target Outcomes – Supervisor Workloads  \nDHS understands that good supervisory support for caseworkers, especially new caseworkers, is \nessential to supporting effective and consistent child welfare practice and positive outcomes for \nchildren and families. DHS committed to meeting the same target for supervisor workloads as it \ndid for caseloads: 90 percent of supervisors meeting the 1:5 worker ratio by a final target date \nof June 30, 2014.   \nAlthough  DHS  has  not  achieved  the  target  of  90  percent  of  supervisors  meeting  the  1:5 \nworkload standard, DHS showed substantial progress over the last six months with the number \nof  supervisors  meeting  the  standard,  which  also  reflects  a  decrease  in  the  number  of \nsupervisors who are assigned and managing their own cases.     \nAs of December 31, 2014, DHS data shows that 70.9 percent of supervisors met the 1:5 \nworkload standard, compared to just 58.8 percent on June 30, 2014.  DHS also reported \nimprovements with the number of supervisors moving into the “close” range for meeting the \nstandard (up to 18 percent from 17.3 percent) and a positive decline (23.9 percent down to \n11.1 percent) for the percent of supervisors managing workloads over the standard. \n28 \n \n\nChild welfare cases managed by supervisors carry the same case weight as the cases managed \nby caseworkers and are calculated into each supervisor’s workload ratio.  As of June 30, 2014, \n79 supervisors carried more than two cases, but by December 31, 2014, only 34 supervisors \ncarried more than two cases.  While important work remains to be done, both to meet the 90 \npercent Target Outcome of supervisor workload compliance and to further reduce the number \nof cases managed by supervisors, DHS is clearly making progress in this area. \nC.   Shelter Use \n \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets related to the placement of children \nin shelters (CSA Section 2.10).   More specifically, DHS committed that it would “ensure all \nchildren are cared for in family-like settings” and “stop its use of temporary placement in \nshelters for all children under 13 years of age.”   \nTo support their review of DHS’ performance in this area, the Co-Neutrals engage regularly in a \nvariety of activities including: announced and unannounced visits and interviews at the Laura \nDester (LD)  and Pauline E. Mayer (PEM) shelters; announced visits at private shelters; review of \nmonthly outcomes data from DHS; review of shelter authorization forms to understand why \nchildren are admitted to shelters and if reasonable efforts are made to identify a family-like \nplacement before resorting to a shelter placement; and finally, review of PEM and LD shelter \nincident reports, which are filed with the shelter director when an incident occurs that requires \neither  medical  attention  or  discipline  of  shelter  residents.  In  this  period,  the  Co-Neutrals \nreviewed 64 shelter authorization forms and 177 shelter incident forms.  \nDuring this review period, the Co-Neutrals focused their shelter Target Outcome verification \nefforts  on  analyzing,  discussing  and  evaluating  DHS’  proposed  core  strategies  to  achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress towards the shelter Target Outcomes. This involved multiple \ndiscussions with DHS and external stakeholders at a time when DHS’ progress was decidedly \nmixed.  While the population of young children in shelters remains well below the original \nbaseline, the population of older children in shelters far exceeds the baseline set in 2012.  \nDHS’ Decision to Close Oklahoma’s State-Operated Shelters  \nIn  February  2015,  after  this  reporting  period  ended,  DHS  leadership  announced  plans  to \nsteadily reduce the number of children placed in DHS’ two state-operated shelters (PEM and \nLD) in order to close the facilities for use as shelters. As of the time of this report writing, DHS \nindicates it will close the two public shelters by the end of 2015.  The Co-Neutrals commend \nDHS for this decision, which should result in additional reductions in shelter-nights, particularly \nwith the younger groups of children who, for this reporting period, were placed more often in \nthe two state shelters as shown in Table 3 and Table 4 below. The closures make sense so long \n29 \n \n\nas DHS does what it has committed to do: substantially expand the number of family-based \nplacements for children in care.  Older children (ages six and older) are more often placed in the \n27 non-state operated shelters that DHS accesses as shown in Table 3 and Table 4 below. As \nsuch, the Co-Neutrals will continue to monitor DHS’ shelter placements in both state operated \nand non-state operated shelters. \nIn addition to its decisions to close the two public shelters, DHS has more recently adopted a \nnumber of additional core strategies with regard to shelters.  The Co-Neutrals will review these \nstrategies as they begin to be implemented and discuss them in future reports. \nTable 3: Child-Nights by Shelter, July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 \nTotal  Shelter  % Laura Dester and \n% Other \nAge Group  Child- Pauline Mayer \nShelters \nNights  Shelters \nOther Shelters  Laura Dester  Pauline E.

Because of this, not all \npercentages add up to 100. \n \n \n \n30 \n \n\nPerformance Standards \n \nIn the Metrics Plan, the Co-Neutrals selected the number of “child-nights” spent in shelters as \nthe metric to assess Oklahoma’s progress in eliminating and reducing shelter use.  One “child-\nnight” is defined as “one child in a shelter at midnight.”  The total number of child-nights is \ncalculated by summing the number of children in shelters at midnight for each night of the \nreporting period.   The Pinnacle Plan includes an exception for shelter placement if the child is \npart of a sibling set of four or more being placed together.20   \nThe timelines set in the Metrics Plan for DHS to meet its shelter targets have been extended \ntwice as DHS’ ongoing shortage of foster homes has negatively impacted its commitment to the \noriginal targets of ending shelter placements for children ages zero to one by December 31, \n2012; children ages two to five by June 30, 2013; and, children six to 12 by June 30, 2014.  DHS \nhas been working toward the following extended targets, which were approved in June 2014:  \n  \n  By July 1, 2014, children under the age of 8 years old will be placed in family-like settings \nrather than staying overnight in shelters unless they are part of a large sibling group of \nthree or more children.    \n \n  By October 1, 2014, children under the age of 10 years old will be placed in family-like \nsettings rather than staying overnight in shelters unless they are part of a large sibling \ngroup of three or more children.   \n \n  By January 1, 2015, children under the age of 13 years old will be placed in family-like \nsettings rather than staying overnight in shelters unless they are part of a large sibling \ngroup of three or more children.   \n \n  By April 1, 2015, DHS will meet the original target and expectation of placing children \nunder the age of 13 years old in family-like settings unless they are part of a large sibling \ngroup of four or more children.   \n \nPerformance for Children under Age Six, Shelter Metrics 5.1 and 5.2 \nAlthough DHS has not reached the Target Outcome of zero child-nights in shelters for children \nunder age six, it has sustained a substantial reduction in shelter-nights in comparison to the \nbaseline of 2,923 child-nights for children ages zero to one, and 8,853 child-nights for children \nages two to five.   During this reporting period, DHS identified 505 child-nights in shelters for \n                                                           \n20 In June 2014, DHS requested and the Co-Neutrals approved that a set of three siblings, with all children being \nover six years old, could be considered - until April 1, 2015 - a large sibling group for the purposes of receiving an \nexception to place the siblings together in a shelter.   \n31 \n \n\nchildren  zero  to  one,  representing  33  unique  children.    DHS  reported  that  the  shelter \nplacements for 23 of these 33 children met an automatic exception.  Further, DHS’ data shows \n2,689  child-nights  in  shelters  during  this  report  period  for  children  ages  two  to  five, \nrepresenting 119 unique children.   DHS reported that the shelter placements for 49 of these \n119 children met an automatic exception.  \nFigure 12: Metrics 5.1 and 5.2 – Shelter-Nights, Children Ages 0 - 5  \n10,000\n8,853 \n9,000\n8,000\n7,000\n6,000\n5,000 4,357 \n4,000\n2,923 \n2,689 \n3,000\n2,080 \n2,000\n843 \n1,000 190  505   \n0  \nAges 0 -1 Ages 2 - 5  \n \nBaseline Jan - 14 Jul - 14 Jan - 15 Source: DHS Data \n \nThe Co-Neutrals’ Commentary Three found that DHS had made good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress with regard to eliminating shelter placements for children \nunder age six.  DHS has maintained a substantially lower number of child-nights relative to the \nbaseline and has taken a significant step to further reduce shelter placements of the youngest \nchildren with its commitment to close the two state-operated shelters.  However, shelter \nrecords  show  that  DHS  continues  to  struggle  with  the  shortage  of  family-like  placements \navailable to meet the diverse and special needs of children in DHS custody.   \nFor this period, the Co-Neutrals reviewed 64 shelter authorization forms (shelter placement \nforms that are completed by casework staff and approved by DHS senior management), which \nshow a pattern of problems with regard to placements for young children, though they also \nreflect a dynamic that exists for older children too:    \n  Police  Involvement:    For  the  most  part,  children  who  are  removed  by  the  police \ncontinue to be taken directly to shelters or shelter admission is assumed.  In the forms \nreviewed  this  period,  there  were  a  few  police-involved  removals  in  which  shelter \nadmission was not automatic, which is progress.  However, the majority of cases with \npolice  involvement  reviewed  by  the  Co-Neutrals  resulted  in  shelter  admission.    In \n32 \n \n\naddition, the shelter authorization forms show that police involvement is viewed by \nsome DHS caseworkers (and signed off by managers) as meaning reasonable efforts to \navoid a shelter placement are not needed.  For example, one form noted that “efforts \nwere not made at the time of entry because the children were in Protective Custody.”  \nThis practice will need to be curtailed to limit further the number of young children \nentering shelter care.  \n  Specialized Medical Homes:  In two cases, foster parents asked DHS to remove children \nwho had been placed with them because of the special medical needs of the children.   \nDHS will need to review whether their existing cadre of homes includes an adequate \nnumber of foster parents who are willing to care for children with complex or chronic \nmedical conditions.  For the most part, the shelters do not have full-time medical staff \n(neither the public nor private shelters) and are an inappropriate option for these \nchildren.  \n  Foster  Home  Placement  Disruptions:    Of the 64  authorization forms  reviewed,  28 \ninvolved admission to shelters because of placement disruption.  Of the 28, two were \nreported to involve children who had medical needs that could not be handled by the \nfoster parents (see above).  In 13 of the 28, the child’s behavior was cited as the \nproblem; the children in most of these cases were about four years old.  Better training \nand support for foster parents to manage the behaviors of young children experiencing \nthe effects of stress and trauma will help DHS avoid unnecessary placement disruptions \nand shelter placements like those described above.  \n  TFC Placement Disruptions:  It is unclear why children’s placements are disrupting from \nTFC homes given that these caregivers are trained and selected to work with higher-\nneeds children. In two cases, TFC homes requested that a young child be removed due \nto their behavior issues (e.g., kicking, screaming, and biting). In these cases, one child \nwas age four and the other was age seven. DHS will need to review, analyze and address \nwhy these disruptions are occurring.  \n \nDespite some slippage with regard to progress for young children admitted to shelters, the Co-\nNeutrals still find that DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained \nprogress toward the Target Outcomes for children under age six in shelters (shelter Metrics 5.1 \nand 5.2).  While DHS has not reached the Target Outcomes of zero “child-nights” in shelters for \nchildren under age six who do not meet a shelter placement exception under the Pinnacle Plan, \nDHS’ work has resulted in a sustained, positive trend toward the Target Outcomes. DHS will \nneed to attend to the specific problems identified above if the practice of using shelters for \nyoung children is to be stopped altogether.  \n \n33 \n \n\nPerformance for Children Ages Six to 12 and Ages 13 and Older, Shelter Metrics 5.3 and 5.4 \nDHS continues to struggle with achieving the same type of major reductions in child-nights for \nchildren ages six and older as it has for children under age six.  In fact, for this reporting period \nthough there was some decline in the number of child-nights for children ages six to 12 years \nold, the number of child-nights for children ages 13 and older continued to trend negatively \nupward and well above the baseline (22 percent above) as shown in Table 5. \nTable 5: Child-Nights in Shelters by Age, July to December 2014 and Change from Baseline \nChild-Nights in  Baseline   Performance \nChange (n)  Change (%) \nShelters by Age  (Jan 2012-June 2013)  (July 2014-Dec 2014 ) \n0 to 1  2,923  505  -2,418  -83.0% \n2 to 5  8,853  2,689  -6,164  -70.0% \n6 to 12  20,147  18,631  -1,516  -8.0% \n13 & Older  20,635  25,108  4,473  22.0% \nTOTAL  52,558  46,933  -5,625  -11.0% \n \nShelter Metric 5.3 – Children Ages Six to 12 \nDHS did make some progress in terms of total shelter-nights for children ages 6-12 since the \nlast report period, but the progress is not substantial (18,631 shelter-nights) compared to the \nstarting baseline of 20,147 child-nights, which represents only an eight percent reduction.   \nFigure 13: Metric 5.3 – Shelter-Nights, Children Ages 6 - 12 \n25,000\n23,127 \n22,288 \n20,147 \n20,000 18,631 \n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n \n0  \nBaseline Jan - 14 Jul - 14   Jan - 15\n \n      Source: DHS Data \n \n \n34 \n \n\nShelter Metric 5.4 and Pinnacle Plan Commitment 1.17 – Youth 13 and Older \nDHS’ Pinnacle Plan did not contemplate that shelter usage would be completely eliminated \nduring the implementation of DHS’ reform efforts under the CSA.  However, DHS did commit \nunder the Pinnacle Plan (Point 1.17) that by June 30, 2014, the state would place children ages \n13 and older in a shelter only if a family-like placement is not available to meet their needs; and \nfurther, would not place any child in a shelter more than one time within a 12-month period \nand for no more than 30 days in any 12-month period.   \nSince the last report period, the number of child-nights in shelters for children ages 13 and \nolder has increased to 25,108 and, as mentioned, remains substantially above the starting \nbaseline of 20,635 child-nights for this older age group. \nFigure 14: Metric 5.4 – Shelter-Nights, Children Ages 13 and Older \n30,000\n25,342  24,935  25,108 \n25,000\n20,635 \n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n \n0  \nBaseline Jan-14 Jul-14  Jan-15\n \n       Source: DHS Data \n \nDuring this six-month review period, DHS for the first time is reporting its performance against \nthe Pinnacle Plan 1.17 Metric as shown in Table 6 below.  Also during this reporting period, DHS \nand the Co-Neutrals established the baseline for this metric, which is based on the previous six-\nmonth reporting period, January 2014 through June 2014 (see Table 6 ).  \nBy June 30, 2015, DHS committed to an interim target21 of ensuring 80 percent of children ages \n13 and older would meet the Pinnacle Plan 1.17 commitment.  DHS’ baseline showed that 200 \n(33.7 percent) of the 593 children ages 13 and older with an overnight shelter stay from January \n                                                           \n21 The final target for this metric (1.17) is 90 percent of children meeting the commitment by June 30, 2016.  \n35 \n \n\nto June 2014 were compliant with Pinnacle Plan 1.17, having had no more than one shelter stay \nand/or no more than 30 nights in a shelter over a 12-month period.  For the following six-\nmonth performance period, DHS’ compliance with Pinnacle Plan 1.17 moved downward with \nonly 166 (29.6 percent) out of 561 children ages 13 and older meeting the more limited shelter \nstay commitment of Pinnacle Plan 1.17.    \nTable 6: Baseline and Performance, Pinnacle Plan 1.17 \nCurrent \nBaseline \nPerformance Categories  Performance \nJan – June 2014  July – Dec 2014 \nChildren Age 13+, with a shelter stay of at least 1 day  593  100.0%  561  100.0% \nShelter Placements Compliant with Pinnacle Plan 1.17 \nThose with 1 stay, less than 31 days  200  33.7%  166  29.6% \nCompliant  TOTAL  33.7%  29.6% \n Shelter Placements Not Compliant with Pinnacle Plan 1.17 \nThose with 1 stay, 31 or more days  136  22.9%  149  26.6% \nThose with 2 or more stays, less than 31 days  74  12.5%  56  10.0% \nThose with 2 or more stays, 31 or more days  183  30.9%  190  33.9% \nNot Compliant  TOTAL  66.3%  70.5% \n \nWhile the interim target for Pinnacle Plan 1.17 is not due until June 30, 2015, the Co-Neutrals \ncontinue to be concerned with the high number of older children placed in shelters. In the last \nCommentary,  the  Co-Neutrals  observed  that  DHS  presented  no  strategic  vision  for  how \nshelters,  foster  homes,  group  homes  and  other  residential  programs  should  interact  and \nsupport each other to best transition children to placements that meet their needs along a \ncontinuum.  This remained true through the end of this review period.  Given this gap and the \nongoing high number of shelter-nights for older children, the Co-Neutrals do not find that DHS \nhas made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress to reduce shelter \nstays for children in DHS custody who are ages six and older (shelter Metrics 5.3 and 5.4).   \nThe Co-Neutrals’ review of shelter authorization forms during this period found that developing \na sufficient supply of TFC placements, and ensuring those homes do not remain vacant, will be \ncritical to reductions in shelter utilization.  Many children and youth in the shelters have the \ntypes of therapeutic needs that should make them eligible for TFC placements.  The Co-Neutrals \nhave asked DHS to analyze why there are so many children on the TFC waiting list (up to 180) \nand a similar number (185) of open TFC beds.  This is particularly relevant to the growing \nnumber of older youth placed in shelters who may be served best in a TFC home.   \n36 \n \n\nOne  core  strategy  identified  by  DHS  in  regards  to  older  youth  placed  in  shelters  is  the \ndevelopment of more group home beds.  It would be premature for DHS to develop new group \nhomes before it has a better understanding why so many of its TFC beds are vacant. In addition, \nDHS needs a better understanding of the needs of its youth in group care.  A report just \nreleased by the federal Children’s Bureau reported that 40 percent of the children and youth in \ngroup care have no “clinical indications” for higher levels of care like group homes or residential \ntreatment centers.22 This is not to say that group care could not be helpful for youth with \nspecialized needs, but DHS should have a better understanding of the needs of its population \nbefore developing new group settings.  It is possible, for example, that DHS needs specialized \nTFC homes for children with a variety of special needs, such as, youth who are medically fragile; \nhave intellectual disabilities; are teen parents; or have gender identity issues that require \nspecialized support. The incongruity between the waiting list and the number of open TFC beds \nin Oklahoma needs immediate attention.  \nShelter Environment \nGiven the ongoing high number of older youth in shelters, the Co-Neutrals began to review \nincident reports for children in the two state shelters.  The incident reports are completed \nwhen a child requires medical attention and/or is involved in a situation that involves medical \ntreatment, a loss of privileges or the use of restraints. For this period, the Co-Neutrals reviewed \n177 incident reports.  As noted in the Co-Neutrals’ last Commentary, these reports paint a \npicture  of  non-therapeutic  residential  settings  that  are  ill-equipped  to  care  for  children \nexperiencing trauma and/or with other special needs.  \nAs noted above, DHS has now decided to close its state shelters, which will address some of \nthese issues. However, given the prevalence of shelter placements and that child-nights for \nolder children is much higher than contemplated by the CSA and the Pinnacle Plan, DHS will \nalso need to address this trend immediately, in collaboration with both its public and private \nshelter providers.   \nD.  Child Maltreatment in Care (MIC) \n \nSection 2.10 of the CSA requires DHS to reduce abuse and neglect of children in its custody, \nwhich Oklahoma tracks and reports by the number of children abused or neglected in two \ndistinct categories, based on the type of perpetrator. The first (Metric 1a) consists of alternative \ncaregivers:  a foster parent,  therapeutic  foster parent,  kinship  parent, or  institutional  staff \nperson (all referred to as resource caregivers). The second (Metric 1b) involves abuse or neglect \n                                                           \n22 A National Look at the Use of Congregate Care in Child Welfare, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nAdministration for Children’s Services, Children’s Bureau, March 2015. \n37 \n \n\nby a parent while the child is in DHS’ custody. \n   \nChild Safety: Abuse and Neglect by Resource Caregivers While Child is in the Legal Custody of \nDHS, Metric 1a \n \nWith regard to the first measure, DHS and the Co-Neutrals agreed DHS would improve safety \nfor children in care using two indicators. First, DHS tracks and reports publicly the number of \nchildren abused or neglected by a resource caregiver on a monthly basis.  Second, DHS and the \nCo-Neutrals adopted the widely used federal metric, “Absence of Child Abuse and/or Neglect in \nFoster Care,” which represents the percent of all children in foster care during a 12-month \nperiod who were not victims of substantiated maltreatment by a foster parent or facility staff. 23   \nFor  this  metric’s  report  period,  which  covers  the  12  months  of  October  2013  through \nSeptember 2014, DHS reported that 206 children out of 16,272 in DHS custody were victims of \nchild maltreatment.  Applying the federal metric, this represents a rate of 98.73 percent of \nchildren in DHS custody during this period who were not victims of child maltreatment.  For \nDHS to have met the Target Outcome of 99.68 percent children in custody absent of child \nmaltreatment, DHS would have had to keep an additional 154 children safe from abuse and \nneglect by a resource caregiver. During the baseline period, April 2013 to March 2014, DHS \nserved 15,806 children and youth, and determined 200 children had been maltreated by a \nresource caregiver, for a rate of 98.73 percent, the same as the current report period.  \n                                                           \n23 In October 2014, the federal Children’s Bureau changed the metric it uses to assess state child welfare efforts to \nreduce maltreatment in care.  The new federal metric combines maltreatment in care by resource caregivers and \nby parents, with some additional adjustments to the methodology.  For consistency and comparability, the Co-\nNeutrals will continue to use the two metrics listed here in their reporting.  \n38 \n \n\nFigure 15: Metric 1a - Absence of Maltreatment in Care by Resource Caregivers \n99.68% \n100%\n98.73%  98.73% \n99%\n98%\n97%\n96%\n95%\n94%\n93%\n92%\n91%\n \n90%\n \nBaseline Oct 2013 -  Sept Target\n \n(April 2013 - 2014\n      Source: DHS Data \nMarch 2014)\n \nIn addition to publicly reporting performance on this federal metric semi-annually, DHS publicly \nreports substantiations of child maltreatment in their monthly data.  Over the same 12-month \nperiod, October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, DHS reported 26024 substantiations of child \nabuse and neglect.  Of these, 54 substantiations are not included in the federal metric adopted \nby the Co-Neutrals as Measure 1a for two reasons: (1) 52 cases of child abuse or neglect were \nexcluded because, according to the federal methodology, both the referral date (date when an \nallegation is made to DHS) and findings date (date when the case is substantiated by DHS) must \nexist in the same 12 month reporting period; and (2) two cases were not counted in the federal \nmetric because they represent multiple substantiations for the same child.  \n \nDuring the period, the Co-Neutrals commenced a case record review of all 24725 abuse and \nneglect substantiations by a resource caregiver that DHS initially reported in its monthly MIC \ndata for the current 12-month reporting period and encouraged DHS to do the same to identify \nareas for improvement in child safety. That review continued after the reporting period and will \nforge the basis of discussions between the Co-Neutrals and the parties in the Spring of 2015.  In \nfuture  Commentaries,  the  Co-Neutrals  will  evaluate  DHS’  efforts  to  achieve  the  Target \nOutcomes to protect children in custody from abuse and neglect, based on DHS’ analysis of \ndata and information, including trends, patterns and practice issues surfaced by DHS and, \nseparately, by the Co-Neutrals in the case record review.  The Co-Neutrals have advised DHS to \n                                                           \n24 A rollup of DHS’ monthly data shows 247 substantiations of abuse and neglect of children in DHS custody.  \nHowever, the total number of substantiations used in the Co-Neutrals’ analysis is 260; 14 substantiations were not \nincluded in the monthly data due to data lag and other programmatic reasons but were eventually reported by \nDHS in the data submitted to the federal government.  \n25 See footnote 20 above. \n39 \n \n\ndevelop a core strategy plan to improve child safety, which DHS plans to submit in the Spring of \n2015.  The Co-Neutrals are reserving judgment on DHS’ efforts to achieve substantial and \nsustained progress in this performance area and will report on DHS’ efforts to implement its \ncore strategy plan in the October 2015 Commentary. \nChild Safety: Abuse and Neglect by Parents While Child is in the Legal Custody of DHS, Metric \n1b \nThe Co-Neutrals adapted the methodology utilized in the preceding section, Abuse and Neglect \nby Resource Caregivers, to measure abuse and neglect by parents while a child is in the legal \ncustody of DHS. This includes the significant population of children who remain the legal \nresponsibility of DHS but who reside in, or have been placed back in, their homes of origin for \ntrial home visits.  In Oklahoma, children can experience trial home visits for months, and DHS \nrecognizes the importance of closely monitoring their safety. \nThis metric for “Abuse and Neglect by Parents While Child is in the Legal Custody of DHS,” \nmeasures performance this way:  Of all children in the legal custody of DHS during the reporting \nperiod, the number and percent of children who were not victims of substantiated or indicated \nmaltreatment by a parent and the number of children who were victims over the 12-month \nperiod.  \nFor the previous period, April 2013 to March 2014, DHS served 15,806 children in custody, 220 \nof  whom  had  parents  who  abused  or  neglected  them  while  in  DHS  custody,  yielding  a \nperformance rate of 98.57 percent. DHS reports that for this 12-month report period, October \n2013  through  September  2014,  there  were  25426  children  who  were  maltreated  by  their \nparents while in DHS custody. This represents a performance rate of 98.44 percent for this \nperiod against a target of 99 percent. For DHS to have reached the target during this period, the \nagency would have had to prevent maltreatment for an additional 92 children. \n                                                           \n26 DHS reported in its federal submission data that 259 children in custody were maltreated by a parent. Data \nerrors in the records of five of these 259 children resulted in over-reporting.   \n40 \n \n\nFigure 16: Metric 1b - Absence of Maltreatment in Care by Parents \n100%\n99.00% \n99% 98.56%  98.37%  98.57%  98.44% \n98%\n97%\n96%\n95%\n94%\n93%\n92%\n91%\n90%\n \nBaseline Oct 12 - Sept 13 April 13 - March 14 Oct 13 - Sept 14 Target\nOct 11 - Sept 12  \nSource: DHS Data \n \nIn  DHS’  monthly-reported  data  for  this  12-month  period,  DHS  shows  an  additional  87 \nsubstantiations of maltreatment of children by their parents while in DHS custody.  These 87 \nsubstantiations are not included among the 254 children reported in the federal measure \nbecause of the federal exception applicable in Metric 1a that both the referral date (date when \nan allegation is made to DHS) and findings date (date when the case is substantiated) must exist \nin the same 12-month reporting period.   \nThe Co-Neutrals have advised DHS to develop a core strategy plan to improve child safety, \nwhich DHS plans to submit in the Spring of 2015.  The Co-Neutrals are reserving judgment on \nDHS’ efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress in this performance area and will \nreport on DHS’ efforts to implement its core strategy plan in the October 2015 Commentary. \nE.  Caseworker Visitation \n \nDHS understands that regular visits between children and caseworkers are important to protect \nchildren, give them an opportunity to ask questions, communicate concerns, and contribute to \ntheir case plans. A key element of permanency practice involves face-to-face time between the \ncritical participants in a child welfare case. There is a substantial body of data and research \ndemonstrating that more frequent visits with caseworkers, parents, and siblings improve safety, \npermanency, and well-being for children in care.27  Regular visits by the same caseworker to the \n                                                           \n27 United States Children’s Bureau (2003). Relationship between caseworker visits with children and other indicator \nratings in 2002 cases; Child Welfare Information Gateway, Sibling Issues in Foster Care and Adoption (December \n2006). The importance of caseworker visitation with children in foster care has also been recognized by Congress \n \n41 \n \n\nsame child are associated with faster permanency, building relationships between caseworkers, \nchildren and caregivers, and providing benchmarks to assess children’s safety and well-being \nfrom visit to visit.  \nThe CSA includes two performance areas related to caseworker visits (CSA Section 2.10): the \nfrequency of caseworker visits, which is defined as the number of required monthly visits \ncompleted  with  children  in  care;  and,  continuity  of  visits  by  the  same  caseworker.  For \nfrequency of visits, the Metrics Plan establishes that DHS will report the following: \n3.1: The percentage of the total minimum number of required monthly face-to-\nface contacts that took place during the reporting period between caseworkers \nand children in foster care for at least one calendar month during the reporting \nperiod.  \n3.2: The percentage of the total minimum number of required monthly face-to-\nface  contacts  that  took  place  during  the  reporting  period  between  primary \ncaseworkers and children in foster care for at least one calendar month during \nthe reporting period. \nRegarding Metric 3.1, DHS reported that caseworkers made 124,355 (96.6 percent) out of \n128,745  required  visits  with  children  during  the  reporting  period  of  January  1,  2014  to \nDecember 31, 2014.  The baseline for DHS’ performance was an already strong 95.5 percent of \nall required visits made. DHS showed improved performance when it last reported in July 2014 \nthat its staff had completed 96.3 percent of all required visits for the period July 1, 2013 to June \n30, 2014.  This most recent report period indicates even further progress.   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nin the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-288 (2006), which requires that child \nwelfare agencies ensure that caseworkers visit at least 90% of children in foster care monthly by 2011.  \n42 \n \n\nFigure 17: Metric 3.1 - Frequency of Visits by All Workers  \n100%\n98% 96.3%  96.6% \n95.5%  95.7% \n96%\n94%\n92%\n90%\n88%\n86%\n84%\n82%\n \n80%  \nBaseline Jan-14 Jul-14   Jan-15\n \n     Source: DHS Data \n \nIn focus groups with workers and supervisors, the Co-Neutrals have heard that visits are a \npriority and that workers feel strongly that they must see the children on their caseload once \nper month.  This continues to be a strength of the system and the Co-Neutrals conclude that \nDHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress with the Target \nOutcome for Metric 3.1.     \nThe  second  indicator,  Metric  3.2,  includes  only  visits  made  by  primary  caseworkers.  DHS \ndecided in its Pinnacle Plan to end the use of secondary workers across the state by January \n2014; however, as noted in previous commentaries, the Co-Neutrals approved DHS’ request to \nstagger implementation of this commitment until January 1, 2015.  \nDHS reported that primary workers made 99,358 visits with children out of 128,745 required \nmonthly visits, which represents 77.2 percent of all required visits during the reporting period \nof January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. For monthly visits conducted by primary workers \nonly, the baseline for DHS’ performance was 51.2 percent and the interim target due for \nFFY2014 is 70 percent.28   \n   \n                                                           \n28 Nine of the twelve months of this reporting period, covering January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, fell within \nFFY2014, for which the interim target is 70 percent.  For December 2014, the last month of this reporting, DHS \nreported its performance at 81.0 percent. \n43 \n \n\n   \nFigure 18: Metric 3.2 - Frequency of Primary Worker Visits \n100%\n90%\n80% 74.1%  76.0%  77.2% \n70%\n60%\n51.2% \n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n \n10%\n \n0%\n \nBaseline Jan-14 Jul-14 Jan-15\n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nDHS has continued to trend positively in this performance area, which reflects DHS’ successful \nimplementation of its commitment to end the use of secondary workers. The Co-Neutrals \nconclude that DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress \nwith the Target Outcome for Metric 3.2. \nPerformance Metrics for Continuity of Visits, Metrics 3.3a and 3.3b \nThe metric the Co-Neutrals use to assess Oklahoma’s progress on continuity of children’s visits \nwith the same caseworker is staged in two phases: first assessing continuity of visits over three \nmonths (Metric 3.3a) and then over six months (Metric 3.3b). For the period from January 1, \n2014 to December 31, 2014, the Co-Neutrals use a metric that measures continuity over a \nthree-month period: \n3.3a: The percentage of children in care for at least three consecutive months \nduring the reporting period who were visited by the same primary caseworker in \neach of the most recent three months, or for those children discharged from \nDHS  legal  custody  during  the  reporting  period,  the  three  months  prior  to \ndischarge. \nThe Co-Neutrals established that DHS’ baseline performance for this metric was 53 percent and \nset a target of 75 percent by December 31, 2014. DHS reported that between July 1, 2014 and \nDecember 31, 2014, there were 10,250 children in DHS custody who required at least three \nconsecutive visits.  Of these 10,250 children, 6,640 (64.8 percent) were visited by the same \nprimary caseworker in their most recent three months in care.  This data shows progress over \n44 \n \n\nthe performance data DHS reported for the previous six months when 57.8 percent of children \nhad three consecutive visits with the same primary worker.   \nFigure 19: Metric 3.3a - Continuity of Worker Visits by Primary Workers \n100%\n90%\n80%\n70% 64.8% \n57.8% \n60% 53.0% \n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%  \n0%  \n \nBaseline Jul-14 Jan-15\n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nAlthough DHS did not reach the 75 percent target for this metric by December 31, 2014, the Co-\nNeutrals understand that DHS’ improved performance from 53 to 64.8 percent in one year \nrepresents, again, DHS’ commitment to complete child visits and reduce its case assignments to \nsecondary workers.  The Co-Neutrals find that DHS has made good faith efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress for this first phase of the continuity of visits metric.   \nDHS, in its next semi-annual data report, will present performance data on the second phase of \nthe continuity of visits metric (3.3b), which will assess the number of children with consecutive \nmonthly visits with the same primary caseworker over a six-month period.  Moving forward, \nthis six-month continuity metric replaces the first phase of this metric (3.3a) that reviewed a \nthree-month period of visits.  \nDuring this performance period, DHS and the Co-Neutrals established the baseline and target \nfor the six-month continuity of visits metric.  For the period of July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014, \nDHS reported a baseline of 40.6 percent and the Co-Neutrals approved a final target of 65 \npercent. \nAs  DHS  continues  to  work  toward  improving  caseloads  and  ending  the  use  of  secondary \nworkers – except in limited, supervisor approved cases – the Co-Neutrals anticipate that DHS \nwill continue to report progress with all its metrics for caseworker visits.   As DHS reduces its \ncaseloads, the Co-Neutrals also expect that DHS will work to improve the quality of caseworker \nvisits. \n45 \n \n\nCaseworkers and supervisors have expressed to the Co-Neutrals that while completing visits is a \npriority, their high caseloads frequently limit their time with children, parents, foster parents or \ngroup home staff.  Both caseworkers and supervisors readily admit that they will need longer \nvisits to ensure that visits are used to thoroughly review any issues of concern and to establish \na relationship with the children, birth parents/guardians and foster parents or other substitute \ncaretakers on their caseloads (such as group home staff).  The Co-Neutrals are undertaking a \nreview of DHS case records that includes an assessment of the quality of caseworker visits as \none area of case practice, among several, that are used to ensure the safety and well-being of \nchildren in care. The Co-Neutrals have shared with DHS their findings from this review in order \nto  conduct  a  joint  assessment  of  the  records  and  will  report  on  findings  in  the  next \nCommentary.  \nF.  Placement Stability \nThe CSA requires that DHS establish performance targets to provide stability of placements for \nchildren in DHS custody (CSA Section 2.10) and reduce the number of times a child moves to a \nnew placement while in DHS custody. It is widely understood and reported that placement \ninstability causes trauma for children and is associated with increased behavioral challenges \nand poor educational and health outcomes, and longer waits to permanency.  \nPerformance Standards \nThe Co-Neutrals and DHS agreed to use the federal Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System \n(AFCARS) files and definitions for placement moves to measure children’s placement stability. \nThis report reviews performance data for the period October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014 for \nMetrics 4.1 (a through c) and 4.2. \nPerformance Outcomes \nDHS understands the importance of a child’s first placement being the best placement to \nsupport placement stability and that this approach requires DHS to establish and maintain a \nrobust continuum of care (foster homes, TFCs and higher levels of care such as group homes) to \nmeet the diverse needs of children in DHS’ custody.  Achieving stable placements also requires \ncaseworkers to have manageable caseloads, so they have the time needed to focus on the \nchildren and foster families who depend on their support.   \nFor this reporting period, DHS continues to show some improvements for Metrics 4.1 a, b and c \nas noted in Table 7 below.  These metrics report on the number of children who experience two \nor fewer placements at different lengths of time in DHS custody (e.g., 12, 24 or 36 months).  For \nMetric 4.2, as well, DHS achieved some small improvements over the starting baseline (from 74 \n46 \n \n\nto 77.7 percent) – despite a slight decline in performance in this report period compared to the \nlast (from 78 to 77.7 percent).  \nTable 7: Placement Stability Baselines, Targets, and Current Performance \nBaseline  Performance  Performance  Performance \nTarget \nMetric  Oct 2011 - Oct 2012 –   April 2013 – Oct 2013 – \nJune 30, 2016 \nSept 2012  Sept 2013  March 2014  Sept 2014 \n4.1(a): percent of children in custody with 2 \n70.0%  88.0%  72.9%  74.4%  76.1% \nor fewer placements who are in care less \nthan 12 months \n4.1(b): percent of children in custody with 2 \n50.0%  68.0%  50.8%  52.3%  54.0% \nor fewer placements who are in care more \nthan 12 months but less than 24 months \n4.1(c): percent of children in custody with 2 \n23.0%  42.0%  24.8%  26.0%  27.5% \nor fewer placements who are in care at least \n24 months \n4.2: percent of children in care more than 12  74.0%  \n88.0%  76.5%  78.0%  77.7% \nmonths, with 2 or fewer placements after  (Apr.‘12–\nMar.‘13) \ntheir 12 months in care  \n \n \nWhile  DHS  is  trending  positively  for  these  metrics,  the  level  of  improvement  is  not  yet \nsubstantial. The Co-Neutrals have advised DHS to move with a sense of urgency to develop a \ncore strategy plan, which DHS plans to submit in the Spring of 2015. The Co-Neutrals are \nreserving  judgment  on  DHS’  efforts  to  achieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress  in  this \nperformance area and will report on DHS’ efforts to implement its core strategy plan in the \nOctober 2015 Commentary.  \nG.  Permanency  \n \nChildren and youth in the child welfare system need and deserve loving and permanent families \nto keep them safe and to support their emotional, physical and social development. When DHS \nremoves a child from their family due to abuse and/or neglect,  the agency establishes a \npermanency case goal for the child. For most children, reunification, adoption or guardianship \nis the child’s permanency goal and DHS develops individualized case plans designed to achieve \ntimely permanency for all children in the state’s custody.  In the Pinnacle Plan, DHS also \ncommitted  to  implement  targeted  strategies  for  children  who  experience  permanency \nchallenges. This includes youth who are legally free for adoption but are at risk of exiting foster \ncare without a permanent family, children who are legally free without an identified adoptive \nplacement, children and youth in congregate care and children with a goal of reunification who \nremain in foster care without permanency. DHS’ recent data analysis shows children with \ndisabilities, as well as older youth, are more likely to experience longer lengths of stay. Given \nthis, it is imperative that DHS target its efforts to support these groups of children. \n47 \n \n\nSince the beginning of DHS’ reform efforts, the Co-Neutrals have encouraged DHS to sequence \nits implementation of the Pinnacle Plan with an initial, intense focus on three performance \nareas – reducing caseloads so that staff have the time and capacity to care for children; \nincreasing the supply of foster and therapeutic foster homes so that children who have been \nremoved from their families have safe and appropriate places to live; and reducing the use of \nshelter placements for children.  At this point in the reform process, DHS should be as intensely \nfocused on achieving timely permanency for children consistent with the Metrics Plan as with \nall other elements of the reform work.  \nIn  recent  discussions,  the  Co-Neutrals  encouraged  DHS  leadership  to  evaluate  the  many \nPinnacle Plan permanency commitments and, from these commitments, adopt a set of core \nstrategies DHS leadership believes will result in improved timely permanency outcomes for \nchildren in its custody. DHS agreed to do so and is expected to submit a core strategy plan to \nthe Co-Neutrals in the Spring of 2015.  DHS’ performance trended negatively for most of the \npermanency measures.  However, the Co-Neutrals reserve judgment on DHS’ efforts to achieve \nsubstantial and sustained progress toward the permanency Target Outcomes in this reporting \nperiod for eight of the ten permanency measures.29 The Co-Neutrals will afford DHS additional \ntime, through June 30, 2015, to demonstrate its adoption and effective implementation of core \nstrategies  to  achieve  substantial  and  sustained  progress  toward  the  permanency  Target \nOutcomes.  \nPermanency Performance \nLegally Free Children without an Adoptive Family on January 10, 2014, Metric 6.1 \nDHS, under Metric 6.1, is responsible to move an identified cohort of legally free30 children and \nyouth  without  an  identified  family  to  permanency expeditiously.  DHS’  strategy  to  achieve \npermanency for the cohort was to allocate additional adoption staff throughout the state to \nconvene permanency case review conferences. The purpose of the reviews is for permanency \nand adoption staff to review the child’s case plan, and to identify barriers to permanency.  \nAction  plans  to  resolve  the  barriers  for  individual  children  are then  developed,  and  both \nadoption  and  permanency  staff  are  responsible  for  advancing,  tracking,  and  monitoring \nprogress. DHS reported that it continued to utilize this targeted, child-specific review process \nthroughout the reporting period and will continue to do so moving forward. \n                                                           \n29 For one of the ten permanency measures, Metric 6.1, the Co-Neutrals are evaluating performance using the \nTarget Outcomes set for two separate age groups established for the identified point-in-time legally free cohort.  \n30 These are children and youth whose parents rights have been legally terminated by the Court. \n48 \n \n\nDHS and the Co-Neutrals established a point-in-time cohort of 292 children who were legally \nfree  for  adoption  as  of  January  10,  2014,  and  who  did  not  have  an  identified  adoptive \nplacement.  On June 10, 2014, the Co-Neutrals established permanency targets for these \nchildren and youth as follows:  \n  By June 30, 2016, 90 percent of the 207 children who were ages 12 and under on \nJanuary 10, 2014 will achieve permanency. \n  By June 30, 2016, 80 percent of children who were ages 13 and over on January 10, \n2014 will achieve permanency. \n \nDHS reported that 47 (22.7 percent) of the 207 children in the younger segment of the cohort \n(ages 12 and under) achieved permanency as of January 1, 2015.  This is an increase of 30 \nchildren since August 15, 2014 when DHS last reported to the Co-Neutrals that 17 children had \nachieved permanency.  For this younger segment of the cohort, the Co-Neutrals find that DHS \nhas made good faith efforts to achieve sustained, positive trending toward the Target Outcome.   \nFor the 85 youth in the older group (ages 13 and older), DHS reported that a total of eight \nchildren achieved permanency as of January 1, 2015, an increase of six children since August \n15, 2014.   DHS also reported that as of December 31, 2014, six children in the older age group \nof the cohort have aged out of custody without achieving permanency. Given the low number \nof children who are moving to permanency in this older segment of the cohort, as well as the \nnumber of children aging out, DHS will need to expand its permanency strategies to ensure the \nchildren in this age group achieve permanency.  The Co-Neutrals do not find that DHS has made \ngood faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward the Target Outcome for \nthe older segment of the legally free cohort identified for Metric 6.1. \nDHS reported that an additional 30 children placed in adoptive homes were in trial adoption \nstatus on January 1, 2015, a sign that more children should achieve permanency in upcoming \nmonths. The Co-Neutrals will report on these permanency outcomes and the distribution across \nthe two age groups in the October 2015 Commentary. \n \n \n \n49 \n \n\nTable 8: Permanency Performance for Metric 6.1 \nPermanency  Permanency  Permanency \nPermanency Metric  Baseline \nTarget by   Achieved as of  Achieved as of \nJune 30, 2016  August 15, 2014  January 1, 2015 \n6.1: Of all legally free  207 children- 17 children  47 children \n90% \nchildren not in an adoptive  Age 12 and  (8.2%) achieved  (22.7%) achieved \nplacement on 1/10/14, the  under  permanency  permanency \n85 children- 2 children (2.4%)  8 children (9.4%) \nnumber who have achieved \n80% \nAge 13 and  achieved  achieved \npermanency.  \nolder  permanency  permanency \n \nFinal Target Outcomes for this cohort of children are set to be achieved by June 30, 2016, and \nthere are no interim performance targets.  The progress made thus far by DHS is encouraging, \nparticularly for children ages 12 and younger, and the Co-Neutrals look forward to discussing in \nthe next Commentary DHS’ ongoing efforts on behalf of children and youth in the cohort. \nTimeliness of Children’s Permanency, Metrics 6.2 (a-d)  \nMetrics 6.2 (a-d) measure DHS’ progress in achieving timely permanency for children who \nentered foster care at a designated time and who achieved permanency in 12, 24, 36 or 48 \nmonths from the child’s removal from their family. In three (6.2 a, b and c) of the four 6.2 \nmetrics for timeliness to permanency, DHS is trending negatively with the remaining metric \n(6.2d)  showing  some  recent  improvement.  The  following  Figures  detail  the  baselines, \nperformance to date and targets for the achievement of timely permanency for children in DHS’ \ncustody. \nMetric  6.2a,  Permanency  within 12  months of  removal:  DHS  reported  that of the  2,901 \nchildren who entered foster care between April 1, 2013 and September 30, 2013, 818 children \nachieved permanency within 12 months of their removal date.  This represents a permanency \nachievement rate of 28.2 percent for Metric 6.2a – the Target Outcome is 55 percent.  The goal \nis for DHS to achieve a higher outcome number for this metric.  With the baseline set at 35 \npercent,  DHS’  performance  has  trended  negatively  and  below  the  baseline  for  three \nconsecutive reporting periods.  \n50 \n \n\nFigure 20: Metric 6.2a - Permanency within 12 Months of Removal \n60% 55.0% \n50%\n40% 35.0% \n31.8% \n28.9%  28.2% \n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n \n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nMetric 6.2b, Permanency within two years of removal: DHS reported that of the 1,787 children \nwho entered foster care between April 1, 2012 and September 30, 2012 and stayed in foster \ncare for at least 12 months, 669 children achieved permanency within two years of their \nremoval date.  This represents a permanency achievement rate of 37.4 percent for Metric 6.2b \n– the Target Outcome is 75 percent. The goal is for DHS to achieve a higher outcome number \nfor this metric. With the baseline set at 43.9 percent, DHS’ performance has trended negatively, \nas performance was consistently below and further from the baseline in each reporting period. \n51 \n \n\nFigure 21: Metric 6.2b - Permanency within 2 years of Removal \n80% 75.0% \n70%\n60%\n50% 43.9% \n41.0% \n38.8%  37.4% \n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nMetric 6.2c, Permanency within three years of removal: DHS reported that of the 924 children \nwho entered foster care between April 1, 2011 and September 30, 2011 and stayed in foster \ncare for at least 24 months, 346 children achieved permanency within three years of their \nremoval date.  This represents a permanency achievement rate of 37.4 percent for Metric 6.2c \n– the Target Outcome is 70 percent.   With the baseline set at 48.5 percent, performance is \ntrending  negatively  with  DHS  reporting  three  consecutive  performance  outcomes  that \nrepresent a decrease from the previously reported data.  The goal is for DHS to achieve a higher \noutcome number for this metric. All three performance outcomes DHS has reported to date for \nMetric 6.2c have been below the baseline. \n52 \n \n\nFigure 22: Metric 6.2c - Permanency within 3 years of Removal \n80%\n70.0% \n70%\n60%\n48.5%  46.9% \n50% 43.7% \n37.4% \n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nMetric 6.2d, Permanency within four years of removal: DHS reported that of the 359 children \nwho entered foster care between April 1, 2010 and September 30, 2010 and stayed in foster \ncare for at least 36 months, 141 children achieved permanency within four years of their \nremoval date.  This represents a permanency achievement rate of 39.3 percent for Metric 6.2d \n– the Target Outcome is 55 percent.   As shown in Figure 23 below, DHS has shown mixed \nperformance in the last three reporting periods. The goal is for DHS to achieve a higher \noutcome number for this metric.  With the baseline set at 46.6 percent, DHS reported that its \nperformance for this period is below the baseline. However, performance improved from the \nlast reporting period when 32.7 percent of children in the cohort achieved permanency.   \n53 \n \n\nFigure 23: Metric 6.2d - Permanency within 4 years of Removal \n60% 55.0% \n48.5% \n46.6% \n50%\n39.3% \n40%\n32.7% \n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \nDHS  has  acknowledged  there  have  been  significant  challenges  to  improved  permanency \npractice due to the increase in the number of children in care, high worker caseloads, worker \nturnover, and the lack of placement resources for children in DHS’ custody.  DHS has also \nacknowledged that progress in reducing worker caseloads and in developing an increased pool \nof foster home and TFC placements are directly linked to better permanency outcomes for \nchildren and youth.  \nChildren’s re-entry to foster care within 12 months of exit, Metric 6.3 \nMetric 6.3 measures how well DHS ensures that children who achieve permanency remain with \ntheir permanent family and do not re-enter foster care in a short period of time. Specifically, \nMetric  6.3  measures  re-entry  to  foster  care  within  12  months  of  a  child’s  discharge  to \npermanency (not including adoption) in the 12-month period prior to the reporting period.  \nThe baseline for this metric is 10.3 percent of children re-entering care; the final target set for \nJune 30, 2016 is no more than 8.2 percent of children re-entering care.  For this period, DHS \nreported that of the 2,638 children who discharged to permanency (not including adoption) \nbetween October 1, 2012 and September 30, 2013, 225 children re-entered care within 12 \nmonths,  which  represents  8.5  percent  of  child  re-entries.  DHS’  performance  has  trended \npositively with respect to this permanency metric, as performance moved closer to the final \nTarget Outcome in each of the reporting periods. \n54 \n \n\nFigure 24: Metric 6.3 - Re-entry within 12 Months of Exit \n12%\n10.3%  10.0% \n9.4% \n10%\n8.5%  8.2% \n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n \n \n \nSource: DHS Data \n \n \nPermanency for Older Legally-Free Youth, Metric 6.4 \nThis metric measures the experience of a cohort of legally free youth who turned 16 years of \nage within two to three years before the report period and tracks those children to measure \nthe percentage of these youth who exited foster care to permanency by age 18, the percentage \nwho remain in care after age 18, and the percentage who exit care without permanency.  The \ninterim and final Target Outcomes for this metric are set only for the percentage of youth who \nwill achieve permanency, while the other outcomes of youth exiting care without permanency \nor remaining in care are publicly reported to provide transparency into the overall experience \nof these youth. \nDHS’ baseline for this permanency metric was set at 30.4 percent of youth exiting with a \npermanent family.  Two interim targets were set, the first of which is 50 percent of youth \nexiting to permanency by December 31, 2014, and the second with 75 percent exiting to \npermanency by December 31, 2015. The final target is set at 80 percent by June 30, 2016. \nFor this period, DHS reported that 148 legally free children turned 16 years old between \nOctober 1, 2011 and September 30, 2012.  Thirty-seven of these children, representing 25 \npercent, achieved permanency as follows: \n  Twenty-four were adopted;  \n  Ten exited through guardianship; \n  Two were reunified with their families; and \n  One youth exited through custody to a relative.   \n55 \n \n\n \nOf significant concern to the Co-Neutrals, 92 (62.2 percent) of the 148 youth in the cohort \nexited the state’s custody without permanency.  Nineteen youth (12.8 percent) remained in \ncare on the last day of the reporting period. \nAs shown in the table below, performance outcomes have been below the baseline in all three \nreporting periods and fall well-short of the 50 percent interim permanency target established \nfor December 31, 2014. \nTable 9: Permanency Performance for Metric 6.4 \nReported  Reported  Reported  Target \nPermanency Metric  Baseline \nJan 2014  July 2014  Jan 2015 \n6.4:  Among legally free foster  50.0% by \nyouth who turned 16 in the  12/31/14 \nperiod 24 to 36 months prior to  30.4%   \nthe report date the percent    75.0% by \n20.7%  26.9%  25.0% \nthat: exited to permanency by  (July ‘09-June  12/31/15 \nage 18; stayed in foster care  ‘10)   \nafter age 18; and, exited  80.0% by \nwithout permanency by age 18.   6/30/16 \n \nOne  of  DHS’  primary  strategies  to  advance  permanency  for  older  youth  was  to  convene \nPermanency Roundtables (PRT) for legally free youth 16 years of age or older who are at risk of \naging out of foster care without permanency. The goal of the PRT is to identify barriers to \npermanency, to engage a team of partners to brainstorm creative solutions to those barriers, \nand to design an individualized Permanency Action Plan. In July 2013, DHS identified 247 youth \nto participate in the PRT meeting process.  As of March 2015, DHS completed PRT meetings for \n143 youth in the cohort.   \nDHS reported that data collection at the end of each PRT identified three main barriers to \nachieving permanency for these youth: limited or lost connections to youth’s kin, culture and \ncommunity; staff turnover; and youth’s behavioral and mental health needs. DHS reported that \nthe data gathered to determine whether or not PRTs have successfully influenced positive \npermanency outcomes is inconclusive but there is a slight indication of positive improvements \nof permanency achievement in this population. DHS reported data validity limitations due to: \n  Limited responses from workers; \n  Reduced action plan timeframes due to the age of youth and the risk of youth aging out \nbefore the action plan could be completed; \n  Inadequacies in the type of data gathered and measurement capacity; and \n  Staff turnover has affected survey responses and action plan completion. \n56 \n \n\nDHS leadership reported to the Co-Neutrals that they continue to evaluate PRT implementation \nto determine the capacity the agency needs to implement the PRT model with fidelity and to \ndetermine the populations of children and youth for whom PRT meetings will be utilized on an \nongoing basis.  \nTimeliness to Adoption for Children who become Legally Free, Metric 6.5 \nMetric 6.5 measures the timeliness to adoption for children who became legally free for \nadoption in the 12 months prior to the reporting period.  The baseline for this metric was \nestablished at 54.3 percent with the performance target set at 75 percent.  In January 2014, \nDHS’ first reported performance data for this metric showed DHS’ performance at 60.9 percent \n– 6.6 percent above the baseline.  Since that time, DHS’ performance declined to 55.6 percent \nin the previous period and 51.9 percent in current period which is below the established \nbaseline.  DHS reported that of the 1,618 children who became legally free between October 1, \n2012 and September 30, 2013, 839 (51.9 percent) were adopted within 12 months of becoming \nlegally free. \nTable 10: Permanency Performance for Metric 6.5 \nCurrent \nReported  Reported \nPermanency Metric  Baseline  Report  Target \nJan 2014  July 2014 \nJan 2015 \n6.5: Of children who became legally free in \n \nthe 12 months before the report period, \nthe percent who were discharged from \n54.3%  60.9%  55.6%  51.9%  75.0% \nfoster care to a finalized adoption in less \nthan 12 months from the date of   \nbecoming legally free. \n \nAdoption Permanency, Metrics 6.6, and 6.7  \nThe remaining permanency metrics (6.6 and 6.7) measure how well DHS avoids pre-adoption \nplacement disruptions and post-adoption finalization dissolutions.   \nMetric 6.6 measures the percentage of adoption placements that do not disrupt over a 12-\nmonth period, of all trial adoption placements during the previous 12-month period. The \nbaseline for this metric was set at 97.1 percent and the Target Outcome was set at 97.3 \npercent. DHS’ performance has remained flat and below the baseline across the last three \nreport periods.  See Table 11  below.  For this reporting period, DHS’ data shows that, of the \n1,239  children  who  entered  a  trial  adoption  placement  between  October  1,  2012  and \nSeptember 30, 2013, 1,195 children (96.4 percent) did not disrupt within 12 months of entering \n57 \n \n\ntrial adoption.  Forty-four children experienced disruptions in their adoption placements and in \norder for DHS to have met the Target Outcome for this reporting period, 10 less children would \nhave experienced disruptions in their adoption placements.  \nMetric 6.7 measures the percentage of children who achieved permanency through adoption \nover a 24-month period and who did not experience adoption dissolution within 24 months of \nadoption finalization.  The baseline for this metric was established at 99.0 percent and the \nTarget Outcome was set at 99.0 percent. For this reporting period, DHS’ data shows that, of the \n2,865 children who were adopted between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, 2,856 \nchildren (99.7 percent) did not disrupt within 24 months of being adopted. DHS has consistently \nexceeded the Target Outcome for both the current and last two performance periods, reporting \nperformance at 99.7 in each period. See Table 11 below. \nTable 11: Permanency Performance Metrics 6.6, and 6.7 \nCurrent  Target \nReported  Reported \nPermanency Metric  Baseline  Report  June \nJan 2014  July 2014 \nJan 2015  2013 \n6.6: Percent of adoption placements that   \ndid not disrupt over a 12-month period,  97.1%  96.2%  96.4%  96.4%  97.3% \nof all trial adoption placements during \nthe previous 12-month period.   \n6.7: Percent of children whose adoption \n \nwas finalized over a 24-month period \n99.0%  99.7%  99.7%  99.7%  99.0% \nwho did not experience adoption \ndissolution within 24 months of \nfinalization.  \n   \n58 \n \n\nAppendix A: Metric Plan Baselines and Targets (Updated February 2015) \nOklahoma Department of Human Services \nCompromise and Settlement Agreement in D.G. v.

The remediation plan shall be subject to the approval of the Co-Neutrals, and upon Co-\nNeutral approval, DHS shall immediately implement the remediation plan. \n \nd)  Director Lake shall, by November 30, 2014, identify a senior DHS staff person responsible for \ncontinually assessing progress and identifying barriers toward achieving the foster home Target \nOutcomes.   This individual shall serve as the DHS liaison to the Co-Neutrals for all matters \nrelated to the foster home performance area.  \n \n2)  Caseloads \n \na)  DHS shall prepare weekly caseload and position management reports that identify the following \nfor every district office: \n \ni)  The number of caseworker positions allocated to the district. \nii)  The list of caseworkers currently employed (list their caseload carrying capacity under \ngraduated caseloads – 0%, 25%, 50% and 100%). \niii)  The caseloads for each caseworker.   \n67 \n \n\niv)  The number of caseworkers (by type) needed to achieve 90 percent caseload compliance \nbased on the previous week’s workload. \nv)  The number of vacant caseworker positions available to fill. \nvi)  The number of vacant caseworker positions posted to fill. \nvii) The number of caseworker positions vacated and/or new resignations or transfers \nannounced during the previous week. \n \nWhile the primary purpose of the weekly caseload and position management report is for DHS \nleadership to track progress and manage toward better outcomes, DHS will also submit these \nreports weekly to the Co-Neutrals.  Starting on December 1, 2014, DHS will submit to the Co-\nNeutrals its first weekly report, containing all the data elements listed above for which DHS \nalready has the capacity to report. By February 28, 2015, DHS will provide weekly reports to the \nCo-Neutrals that include all the data elements set forth above. \n \nb)  By January 10, 2015, DHS shall identify a set of priority districts that have the highest needs in \nterms of caseloads, vacancies and turnover. The priority districts will be identified using criteria \nproposed by DHS based on a threshold of a percentage of workers who are above the caseload \ncarrying standard, a percentage of vacancies and a rate of turnovers.  The Co-Neutrals will \nreview and approve DHS’ proposed criteria and selected list of priority districts.  Once the set of \npriority districts have been identified and approved, DHS shall provide monthly reports to the \nCo-Neutrals  on  targeted  strategies  to  hire  and  retain  caseworkers  for  this  priority  set  of \ndistricts.  These plans shall include the results of diagnostic assessments of any barriers to hiring \nand retention in the targeted district offices and strategies to overcome those barriers.  \n \nc)  DHS shall produce and submit to the Co-Neutrals monthly reports on its plans and progress \ntoward implementing graduated caseloads and the field mentor training program, two core \ncaseload strategies DHS included in the Pinnacle Plan. \n \nd)  Director Lake shall identify a senior DHS person responsible for continually assessing the weekly \ncaseload and position management reports to identify barriers (short-term, long-term, local and \nstatewide) and opportunities to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward caseload \nTarget Outcomes.  This individual shall serve as the DHS liaison to the Co-Neutrals for all matters \nrelated to the caseload performance area.  The Co-Neutrals direct that this same person will \nengage in weekly calls with all District Directors in priority districts and monthly calls with all \nremaining District Directors related to progress and challenges with caseloads, retention and \nhiring.   \n \n3)  Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation Backlog \n \n68 \n \n\ne)  DHS shall develop and submit to the Co-Neutrals by December 15, 2014 a remediation plan to \nreduce its backlog of overdue CPS investigations.  The remediation plan shall identify current \nbarriers to DHS’ completing investigations within the required 60-day timeframe and core \nstrategies DHS will employ to reduce the backlog.  DHS’ remediation plan will propose interim \ntargets and dates for backlog reduction and a final target date for eliminating the backlog.   \n \nf)  Director Lake shall identify a senior DHS person responsible for continually assessing progress or \nnegative trending with the backlog reduction and identifying barriers (short-term, long-term, \nlocal and statewide) to timely completions of CPS investigations.  This individual shall serve as \nthe DHS liaison to the Co-Neutrals for all matters related to the CPS investigation backlog.   \n \n \nThis order is effective upon publication which is the date noted below. \n \n \nBy:       \n           \nEileen Crummy           Kathleen Noonan    Kevin Ryan \nCo-Neutral      Co-Neutral      Co-Neutral \n \n \nDated: November 14, 2014 \n \n69 \n \n\nAppendix C: November 14, 2014 Memorandum regarding Interim Targets \n \nTo:   Ed Lake and Jami Ledoux \nFrom:  Eileen Crummy, Kathleen Noonan and Kevin Ryan \nDate:  November 14, 2014 \nRe:  Metrics Plan Revisions \nAs provided for in Section 2.10 (f) of the Compromise and Settlement Agreement, the Co-Neutrals are \nrevising the Metrics, Baselines and Targets Plan (Metrics Plan) to include the following targets and \nreporting requirements: \n2.  Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) homes - Annual Net Gain Target \nThe Metrics Plan establishes that “OKDHS shall establish targets for licensing new therapeutic \nhomes to be submitted to the Co-Neutrals by May 30th of each year.”   The Co-Neutrals require that \nDHS also establish an annual target for new TFC homes.32 \na.  For SFY15, the Co-Neutrals establish a net gain target of 56 TFC homes.  For future years, \nDHS will submit to the Co-Neutrals annual net gain targets for TFC homes by May 30th of \neach year.  \nb.  Beginning in December 2014, DHS will report progress toward achieving the SFY15 net gain \ntarget of new TFC homes in its monthly report.    \n \n3.  Foster Homes33 – Annual Net Gain Target, Monthly Reporting \nThe Co-Neutrals established the SFY15 net gain target of 356 new foster homes.    \na.  Beginning in December 2014, DHS will report progress toward achieving the SFY15 net gain \ntarget of new foster homes in its monthly report. \n \n4.  Foster Homes – Annual Interim Target and Monthly Reporting \n \nThe Co-Neutrals determined that the SFY15 new foster home target is 904 homes.  In order to \nbetter track DHS’ progress in meeting the annual target, the Co-Neutrals establish an interim SFY15 \ntarget. \n \n \n                                                           \n32 New TFC homes included in the net gain count are subject to the SFY15t Criteria for Counting New Non-Kin \nFoster and TFC Homes established by DHS and the Co-Neutrals. \n \n33 Non-kinship foster homes \n70 \n \n\na.  By March 31, 2015, DHS will develop 678 new non-kin foster homes as an interim target for \nSFY15.  For future years, the Co-Neutrals will establish an annual interim target (both date \nand target number to be determined) for new foster homes, which will be based on the \nannual target established for that year. \nb.  Beginning in December 2014, DHS will report progress toward achieving the interim target \nfor new foster homes in its monthly report. \n \nThe Co-Neutrals will accept comments from DHS and Plaintiffs before finalizing these revisions to the \nMetrics Plan.

Standard of Review \nThe district court must conduct a de novo review of the Magistrate Judge's Report and \nRecommendation.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Northington v. Marin, 102 F.3d 1564, 1570 (10th \nCir.1996) (“De novo review is required after a party makes timely written objections to a \nmagistrate's report.  The district court must consider the actual testimony or other evidence in the \nrecord and not merely review the magistrate's report and recommendations.”).  The court may \n\n“accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the \nmagistrate judge.”  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).   \n                                             II. Procedural Background \nThis class action was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of all foster children in \nthe legal custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (“DHS”) against members of \nthe Oklahoma Commission for Human Services and the director of DHS.  Plaintiff children sued \ndefendants in their official capacities, alleging policies and procedures adopted by defendants \nhave subjected foster children to significant, ongoing harm and risk of harm, deprivation of the \nchance for safe and stable childhoods and violation of their constitutional and statutory rights.  \nPlaintiffs asserted claims for violation of their substantive due process right under the \nFourteenth Amendment to be free from harm and risk of harm; violation of their liberty and \nprivacy rights guaranteed by the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments; and violation of their \nprocedural due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments based on deprivation \nof state law entitlements. [Dkt. #2]. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted claims for violation of the \nFederal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 621, et seq., and \nbreach of federal contractual obligations to third party beneficiaries.  [Id.]. The court granted \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss the last two claims.  [Dkt. #220].   \nOn May 5, 2009, the court, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, certified a class consisting of  \nall children who are or will be in the legal custody of DHS (1) due to a report or suspicion of \nabuse or neglect; or (2) who are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.  [Dkt. \n#272 at 17].   \nOn December 1, 2011, the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on \nplaintiffs’ claims for violation of liberty and privacy rights and violation of their procedural due \n2 \n \n\nprocess rights.  [Dkt. #741].  The court denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment with \nrespect to plaintiffs’ claim for violation of their substantive due process rights.  [Id.]. \nOn January 4, 2012, the case settled.  [Dkt. #768].  The Compromise and Settlement \nAgreement (“Settlement Agreement”) executed by the parties contained the following \nprovisions: \n1.2  Class Counsel shall mean Angela R. Vicari, Frederic Dorwart, Ira P. \nLustbader, John S. Cahalan, Marcia R. Lowry, Paul DeMuro, Phillip A. Geraci, \nR. Thomas Seymour, Scott A. Graham, William Kapell, Miriam F. Ingber, Patrick \nS. Almonrode, Jodi K. Miller, Laurence D. Borten, Philip G. Barber, and Sarah T. \nRusso. \n \n1.3  Class  Counsel  Fees  and  Expenses  shall  mean  reasonable  fees  and \nexpenses of Class Counsel in an amount to be determined by the Court, provided \nthe services and expenses of Frederic Dorwart Lawyers have been and will be \nprovided pro bono for the benefit of the Plaintiff Class. The Court shall retain \njurisdiction to make this determination.  The Named Plaintiffs and Next Friends \nshall not seek or be awarded compensation in return for their role in the Class \nAction Litigation.  Settling Defendant stipulates that Class Counsel  is entitled to \nClass Counsel Fees and Expenses but reserves the right to dispute the amount of \nClass Counsel Fees and Expenses.   \n [Dkt. #770-1]. \n[Dkt. #770-1 at 3].   \n  In the pending motion, plaintiffs seek an award of reasonable attorney fees under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and ¶ 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement.  They requested an award of $8,345,588 \nfor 36,188 billable hours1 and $1,174,831 in reimbursable expenses, for a total of $9,520,419.  \nDefendants opposed the motion, arguing that neither the hourly rates nor the number of hours \nwere reasonable, and asserting that the court should either disallow an award entirely or limit the \namount of the award to between $2.6 and $3.7 million.   \n                                                 \n1 Total plaintiffs’ attorney hours were 39,822 (excluding 2,246 hours of the Dorwart firm’s time and 4,007 hours of \nKaye Scholer’s time (both pro bono), and 3,817 hours spent by “temporary attorneys,” for which plaintiffs seek \nrecovery as an expense). [Dkt. #790 at 8]. Plaintiffs, in their exercise of billing judgment, excluded 3,634 hours of \ntime expended by Children’s Rights attorneys.  [Dkt. #791, Marcia Lowry Dec., ¶ 12].  Defendants’ counsel (Riggs, \nAbney and Crowe & Dunlevy) expended 38,850 hours on the case, exclusive of work by DHS staff and in-house \ncounsel.  [Dkt. #790 at 25]. \n \n3 \n \n\nThe attorney fee motion was referred to Magistrate Judge McCarthy, who issued a Report \nand Recommendation.  Defendants have filed four objections.   \nIII. Magistrate Judge’s Recommendation \n  The Magistrate Judge recommended that: \n1.  The court reject defendants’ argument that plaintiffs may only recover fees \nand expenses for the attorneys specifically named as “Class Counsel” in ¶ 1.2 \nof the Settlement Agreement. [Dkt. #846 at 3-4]. \n \n2.  The court reject defendants’ argument that the fee award should be reduced \nbecause only one of the five claims asserted in the complaint survived \ndismissal and/or summary judgment. [Id. at 5]. \n \n3.  The court reject defendants’ argument that the overall fee award be reduced \nbased on alleged unethical conduct by plaintiffs’ attorneys in communicating \nwith Steven Dow, a member of the Oklahoma Commission for Human \nServices. [Id. at 5-6]. \n  \n4.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys be paid for travel time at a rate of $50 per hour and \nreimbursed for reasonable travel expenses. [Id. at 8]. \n \n5.  Local hourly rates of up to $300 be applied to all of plaintiffs’ attorneys, \nexcept that a rate of $450 per hour should apply to Marcia R. Lowry; and the \ncourt accept defendants’ expert report on the rates for the individual attorneys. \n[Id. at 9-11]. \n \n6.  Local hourly rates of $60-$75 per hour be applied to paralegal and intern time, \nfor an average of $70 per hour, as recommended by defendants’ expert. [Id. at \n12]. \n \n7.  The court reduce plaintiffs’ total lodestar fee2 of $6,017,215 by 7.5 percent (as \nsuggested by plaintiffs’ expert) to account for inadequate descriptions of tasks \nin billing entries, duplication of effort and lack of billing judgment. [Id. at 15-\n16]. \n \n8.  A total 209 of the 9,047 hours of paralegal time be eliminated because it \nrepresented work that was secretarial in nature and not separately billable to a \nclient; and the remaining 8,838 hours be reduced by 7.5 percent based on lack \nof billing judgment.  [Id. at 15-16]. \n \n                                                 \n2 The lodestar is determined by multiplying the hours reasonably expended by plaintiffs’ counsel on the litigation by \na reasonable hourly rate.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983); Case v. Unified School Dist. No. 233, \nJohnson County, 157 F.3d 1243, 1249 (10th Cir. 1998). \n4 \n \n\n9.  The court award attorney fees totaling $5,596,010, paralegal/intern fees \ntotaling $572,260; and travel fees totaling $139,500. [Id. at 16-17]. \n \n10. Plaintiffs’ request for reimbursement of expenses totaling $1,174,831 be \nreduced by $450,672, with reductions broken down as follows:   \n \n  costs recoverable under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (requiring filing of a bill of \ncosts)--$193,267.60; \n  expert deposition preparation--$65,571.183 (should be $68,571.18) \n  litigation support--$16,450.13; \n  conference meals--$546.69; \n  working meals--$6,576.22; \n  other inappropriate meal requests--$3,000.00; \n  other transportation--$50,121.87; \n  travel agent fees--$2,100.00 \n  cancelled flights--$7,050.00 \n  Amtrak charges--$825.00 \n  Kaye Scholer law firm inappropriate charges for travel and meals--\n$3,048.02; \n  Kaye Scholer law firm litigation expense--$49,625.74; \n  Temporary attorneys--$52,490.00. [Id. at 28]. \n \n \n11. Overall, the Magistrate Judge recommended an award to plaintiffs of attorney \nfees and expenses in the total amount of $7,031,928, broken down as follows: \n \n  Attorney fees of $5,596,010; \n  Travel time of $139,500; \n  Paralegal and intern time of $572,260; and \n  Reimbursable expenses of $724,158  [Id.]. \n \nIV. Defendants’ Objections \n \n  Defendants object to the Report and Recommendation on the following bases:  (A) the \nMagistrate Judge erred as a matter of law in recommending an award of fees for attorneys not \nidentified in the Settlement Agreement as “Class Counsel;” (B) the Magistrate Judge erred as a \nmatter of law and ignored the clear weight of evidence in failing to recommend a reduction in \nfees for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ alleged inappropriate contact with Steven Dow; (C) the \n                                                 \n3 The Magistrate Judge recommended excluding $68,571.18 in expert deposition preparations, but deducted only \n$65,571.18. [Dkt. #846 at 19-20].  The entire $68,571.18 is excluded in the court’s calculations. \n5 \n \n\nrecommended reduction of 7.5 percent to plaintiffs’ requested fee award is insufficient;  and (D) \nplaintiffs’ claimed expenses for temporary attorneys and Kaye Scholer’s litigation support \nshould be disallowed in their entirety. \nV. Analysis \nA. Award of Fees for Work by Attorneys Not Listed as “Class Counsel” \n  Defendants argue that under ¶ 1.2 and ¶ 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement, plaintiffs \nwaived their right to seek legal fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for work by attorneys not listed as \n“Class Counsel” in ¶ 1.2.   \nThe Supreme Court has held that a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights action “should \nordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circumstances would render an award unjust.”  \nEllis v. University of Kansas Medical Center, 163 F.3d 1186, 1200 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).  The presumption in favor of attorneys’ fees \nmay be overcome by waiver of fees by the prevailing plaintiff.  Id.  However, “[a]bsent express \nlanguage in the settlement agreement waiving the right to recover attorney fees, the intent of the \nparties governs.” Id. \n  Waiver is “the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right.”  Barringer v. \nBaptist Healthcare of Oklahoma, 22 P.3d 695, 700-01 (Okla. 2010) (quoting Faulkenberry v. \nKansas City Southern Ry. Co. 602 P.2d 203, 206-07 (Okla. 1979).  “The doctrine is essentially a \nmatter of intention, focusing on the intent of the party against whom waiver is asserted.”  Id.  \nWaiver can be accomplished either expressly or implicitly, but an implied waiver requires “a \nclear, unequivocal and decisive manifestation of the party’s relinquishment of the right.”  Id. “No \none can be bound by a waiver of one’s rights unless it was made with full knowledge of the \nrights intended to be waived.” Faulkenberry, 602 P.2d at 207. \n6 \n \n\n  Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 do not expressly waive plaintiffs’ right to seek recovery of \nattorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for non-listed attorneys.  As the Magistrate Judge correctly \nnoted, Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 neither mention § 1988, nor waive the right to seek statutory fees \nfor non-listed attorneys.  In Paragraph 1.3, the “Settling Defendant,” the Oklahoma Commission \nfor Human Services, stipulates that Class Counsel are entitled to fees and expenses; the language \nof the paragraph in no way limits plaintiffs’ right to seek fees under § 1988 for non-listed \nattorneys.   \nNor, in this court’s view, can Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 be fairly read to constitute an \nimplied waiver.  The language in the paragraphs simply falls short of “a clear, unequivocal and \ndecisive manifestation of [plaintiffs’] relinquishment of the right” [to seek fees under § 1988 for \nnon-listed attorneys].  Barringer, 22 P.3d at 701.   \nThe court concludes that plaintiffs did not waive their right to seek attorney fees under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 for attorneys not listed as “Class Counsel” in Paragraph 1.2 of the Settlement \nAgreement. \n \nB. Reduction for Communications with Steven Dow and DHS Personnel \n  Defendants seek a significant reduction in the fee award due to plaintiffs’ counsels’ \nunauthorized contact with represented defendants.  Specifically, they contend plaintiffs’ counsel \nviolated Oklahoma Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 by communicating with DHS \nCommissioner Steven Dow and DHS personnel without the consent of DHS counsel or a court \norder authorizing such communication.   \nTime records produced by attorneys for Children’s Rights contained numerous entries \nconcerning communications between plaintiffs’ attorneys and confidential sources or informants.  \n7 \n \n\nIn connection with the attorney fee motion, defendants sought to compel production of \ndocuments disclosing the identities of the confidential sources.  [Dkt. #804].  The Magistrate \nJudge conducted an in camera review of the list of confidential sources before ruling on the \nmotion to compel. [Dkt. #812].   \nIn his Report and Recommendation on the attorney fee motion, the Magistrate Judge \nobserved that Dow was not on the list of names of “confidential sources” and “with the exception \nof one individual identified as a supervisor, the sources were case workers or other front line \nemployees.”  [Dkt. #846 at 6].  Further, with respect to communications by Dorwart and/or \nLowry with Dow, the court found “the evidence did not establish that there were any \nunauthorized discussions between Plaintiffs’ attorneys and Mr. Dow regarding this litigation” \nand “[t]here is, therefore, no basis for a reduction the fee award for unethical conduct with \nrespect to Mr. Dow, or otherwise.”  [Id.].     \n  With respect to communications with confidential sources, defendants assert the \nMagistrate Judge’s review of plaintiffs’ in camera submission was “insufficient to fully address \nthe Rule 4.2 Issue,” and speculate plaintiffs did not submit all information the Magistrate  Judge \nordered them to produce for in camera review.  [Dkt. #850 at 22].  They state, “In other words, \nthe R&R reflects that Plaintiffs’ counsel has not submitted descriptions of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \ncontact with Mr. Dow or with any other DHS-affiliated individual, unless that individual also \nhappened to be named as a ‘source’ by Children’s Rights on a time record filed with the Court.”  \n[Id. at 23]. \n  The court declines to second guess the adequacy of the list submitted to the Magistrate \nJudge for in camera review.  The Magistrate Judge reviewed the list in connection with the \nmotion to compel.  He determined none of the people identified on the list were of a level to raise \n8 \n \n\nRule 4.2 issues.  Plaintiffs turned over the time records indicating Dorwart’s contacts with Dow, \nand both Dorwart and Lowry testified about the nature and extent of their communications with \nDow.   \n  Dow was appointed as a member of the Human Services Commission on November 25, \n2009.  [Dkt. #850, Ex. 5].  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d), he was automatically substituted as \na party in this lawsuit.  Time records from the Dorwart firm confirm telephone calls between \nDorwart and Dow on December 16, 2009, and March 2, 2010.  [Dkt. #850, Ex. 7].  Additionally, \na March 8, 2010, entry stated, in pertinent part, “work on care package to Mr. Dow.”  [Id.].  The \ntime records indicate that subsequently, on November 19-21, 2010, numerous emails and \ntelephone calls occurred among Dorwart, Dow and Don Bingham, counsel for defendants.  [Id.].4  \n  Dorwart testified at the hearing that he and Dow are friends and otherwise professionally \nassociated and speak frequently.  [Dkt. #843, TR at 80:24-25].  He testified that in the December \n16, 2009, Dow told him he had long expressed a desire to go on the commission and that DHS \nDirector Howard Hendrick opposed Dow coming on the commission.  [Id., TR at 81:4-23].  The \nMarch 8, 2010 care package for Dow, according to Dorwart, included a number of the filed \npleadings in this case and a copy of the consent decree entered of record in the Tennessee case.  \n[Id., TR at 85:3-11].  Dorwart testified he had talked to Dow sometime before and Dow \nexpressed his desire to see the pleadings in the case so that when he went on the commission he \nwould know what was going on.  [Id., TR at 85:12-17].  Dorwart testified that to his knowledge, \nDow was not serving as a commissioner at the time he sent him the care package.  [Id., TR at \n                                                 \n4 The entry for 12/16/09 states, in pertinent part:  “Teleconference with Steven Dow regarding appointment to DHS \nCommission.” [Dkt. #850, Ex. 7 at pp. 32-33].  The entry for 3/2/10 states, in pertinent part:  “teleconference with \nSteven Dow.”  [Id. at 34]. An entry on 11/19/10 states “Multiple emails to Messrs. Dow and Bingham [DHS \ncounsel] concerning scheduling settlement discussion.” [Id. at 36] The entry for 11/20/10 states “Teleconference \nwith and emails x3 to Mr. Dow concerning settlement discussions.” [Id.]. The entry for 11/21/10 states \n“Teleconference with Mr. Dow and emails x4 to Messrs. Dow and Bingham concerning settlement.” [Id.] \n9 \n \n\n86:12-14].5  In any event, Dorwart’s testimony that he had no substantive discussions with Dow \nregarding this lawsuit is uncontroverted.    \n  Lowry testified she had no substantive communications with Dow.  [Id., TR at 209:19-\n25].  Neither Dorwart nor anyone else communicated to her any discussions they had with Dow.  \n[Id., TR at 210:1-6].   \n  After consideration of the arguments of counsel, together with the testimony and \nevidence presented, this court concludes that any attorney fee award need not be reduced based \non counsels’ contact with Mr. Dow and DHS personnel. \n \nC. Lodestar Reduction \n  In the hearing before the Magistrate Judge, defendants argued for a 30 to 50 percent \nreduction in plaintiffs’ requested fees, and experts for both sides agreed some reduction is \nappropriate.  Defendants’ expert recommended a reduction of 30 percent. [Dkt. #844, TR at \n422:19-20].  Plaintiffs’ expert testified that if he were in the shoes of the court, he would reduce \nthe Children’s Rights attorney fees by 7.5 percent “because of potential duplication of effort or \nitems that were excessive.”  [Dkt. #844, TR at 288:1-25].   \nThe Magistrate Judge recognized serious issues with plaintiffs’ descriptions of tasks in \nbilling entries, duplication of effort, and a lack of billing judgment.  In particular, he noted that—\naccording to defendants—the Children’s Rights attorneys, in more than 840 time entries \nrepresenting $198,414.75 in fees, allocated time to communications with unidentified “sources,” \nand he concluded the entries were too vague to evaluate whether the time spent was reasonable.  \n                                                 \n5 However, Dow had been appointed November 5, 2009, and attended a commission meeting on February 23, 2010.  \n[Dkt. #850, Ex. 6, Minutes of February 23, 2010 Executive Session of the Oklahoma Commission for Human \nService meeting]. \n \n10 \n \n\n[Dkt. #846 at 13].   Further, he observed that defendants had identified over 1,900 billing entries \nfor attorney Kapell that contain the description “electronic mail” and little other detail about the \nsubstance of the work performed, and $36,066.34 in attorney time which defendants argued is \nnot recoverable as it was devoted to non-substantive tasks such as organizing and training \nattorneys.  [Id.].  The Magistrate Judge adopted and recommended plaintiffs’ experts’ \nsuggestion—a reduction of 7.5 percent.  [Dkt. #846 at 15].   \nDefendants argue the recommended 7.5 percent reduction is “meager” and “considerably \nbelow the range of reductions” in other cases. [Dkt. #850 at 9, 11].  They contend the plaintiffs’ \nattorneys’ lodestar should be reduced by at least 25 percent.  [Id. at 10].6  Defendants also \ncontend the requested fees should be reduced because plaintiffs ultimately prevailed on only one \nof their five claims.   \nAlthough the court may reduce a lodestar calculation on the grounds that plaintiffs have \nachieved only partial success, many civil rights cases involve multiple claims “based on a \ncommon core of facts . . . or related legal theories.”  Robinson v. City of Edmond, 160 F.3d 1275, \n1283 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435 (1983). The Tenth \nCircuit has held “that when a plaintiff achieves the principal goal of her lawsuit, lack of success \non some of her interrelated claims may not be used as a basis for reducing the plaintiff’s fee \naward.” Robinson, 160 F.3d at 1283. \n  The court concurs with the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that the facts supporting the \nsuccessful claim were intertwined with the unsuccessful ones.  Therefore, it rejects defendants’ \nargument that a reduction for plaintiffs’ unsuccessful claims is appropriate.   \n                                                 \n6 Further, defendants correctly assert there is an arithmetic error in the calculation of the reduction at pages 16-17 of \nthe Report and Recommendation, and that a 7.5 percent reduction in the subtotal figure of $6,017,215 amounts to a \nreduction of $451,291 (rounded to the nearest dollar) instead of $421,205, as stated on pages 17-18 of the Report \nand Recommendation.   \n11 \n \n\n  This court also concurs with the Magistrate Judge that a reduction in the overall fee \naward is justified by the lack of billing judgment found in the fee request.   Plaintiffs bear the \nburden to prove the reasonableness of “each dollar, each hour, above zero” in their fee request. \nMars v. Credit Bureau of Raton, 801 F.2d 1197, 1210 (10th Cir. 1986).  Their fee application \ncontains numerous deficiencies which undermine their request.  After an independent review of \nthe billing statements, the exhibits, and the testimony presented, this court concludes that a 20 \npercent reduction of the base fee of $6,017,215 is reasonable and appropriate.7  This percentage \nwas determined by considering (1) the lack of billing judgment referenced by the Magistrate \nJudge, including billing entries that do not detail the work performed, and attorney time devoted \nto organizing and training attorneys; (2) the excessive fees Children’s Rights sought for class \ncertification, insofar as the class was provisionally certified without much difficulty, and \nconsidering the significant pro bono assistance plaintiffs received on the issue from Kaye \nScholar;8 (3) the inefficiencies incumbent with high turnover rates of attorneys and staff at \nChildren’s Rights;9 (4) the absence of monthly or periodic billing reviews at Children’s Rights, \nresulting in vague, insufficiently detailed, and excessive billing; (5) duplicative billing entries by \nmultiple attorneys for the same task; and (6) plaintiffs’ failure to provide documentation or \ndescription of the 3,634 hours they wrote off,  making it difficult to evaluate the adequacy of \ntheir exercise of billing judgment.  As a result, the plaintiffs are awarded a reasonable attorney \nfee in the amount of $4,813,772.  Similarly, the court concludes total fees for paralegal/intern \n                                                 \n7 This reduction is consistent with the lodestar reduction in Kenny A. v. Perdue, 454 F. Supp.2d 1260, 1286 (N.D. \nGa. 2006) (ordering 15% reduction in number of non-travel related hours claimed by plaintiffs’ counsel).  \n  \n8 The Kaye Scholer firm reported $236,000 in billable time on the class certification issue.  [Dkt. #844, TR at \n426:14-2]. \n \n9 Defendants’ expert James Sturdivant, testified, based on his review of plaintiffs’ records that only two Children’s \nRights attorneys were at the firm for the entirety of the lawsuit; six came after the case was filed and remained to the \nend; and 37 other timekeepers came and went during the pendency of the case. [Dkt. #844, TR at 424:14-22]. \n12 \n \n\ntime should be reduced by 20 percent.  The requested fee of $618,660 is therefore reduced to an \naward of $494,928 for paralegal and intern time.   \n \nD. Expenses for Kaye Scholar’s Litigation Support and for “Temp Attorneys” \nWhile only those items listed under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 may be awarded as costs, other out-\nof-pocket expenses incurred during litigation may be awarded as attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § \n1988 if (1) the expenses are not absorbed as part of the law firm overhead but are normally billed \nto a private client, and (2) the expenses are reasonable.  Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F.3d 1505, 1517 \n(10th Cir. 1995). \n1. Data Storage Costs   \n Plaintiffs sought reimbursement of a total of $262,120 for out-of-pocket expenses of the \nKaye Scholer law firm.  Phillip Geraci, the Kaye Scholer partner who supervised the firm’s work \non this case, declared that the firm incurred the expenses in connection with this action.  [Dkt. \n#792, Phillip A. Geraci Dec., ¶ 4].   Included in the out-of-pocket expenses was $191,176.95 for \n“litigation support.” Geraci, in his declaration, stated:   \nThe  largest  category  of  reimbursable  expenses  incurred  by  Kaye  Scholer  in \nconnection  with  this  litigation  was  for  litigation  support,  which  consisted  of \npayments to Plaintiffs’ vendor for computerized data loading, storing and hosting \ncharges with respect to the millions of pages of records obtained by Plaintiffs \nduring the discovery phase of the case. \n \n[Id., Geraci Dec., ¶ 7].  Exhibit B to the Geraci Declaration is an itemized list of individual \nexpenses.  It includes eight pages listing payments to three vendors, Iris Data Services, LLC, \nEverest Technologies Co., LLC, and TechLaw Solutions, Inc. for “Litigation Support.”   \nAt the hearing on plaintiffs’ fee motion, attorney Lowry testified the Kaye Scholar firm \nprovided litigation support, “which was…a hosting system for the data and for the electronic \n13 \n \n\ndata that we had collected.  And they maintained that, and we loaded our data onto that hosting \nsystem.”  [Dkt. #843, TR at 163:18-22].  Further, she stated: \nBut I do know personally that the data that we were collecting through electronic \ndiscovery was going up on a system, a computer system that Kaye Scholer was \npaying for.  And that was obviously an essential part of the case, to be able to \nhandle the electronic discovery.    \n \n[Id., TR at 168:5-11].   \nThe Magistrate Judge concluded that, considering the volume of the data production in \nthis case, some expense was necessarily incurred to manage data [Dkt. #846 at 23].  However, he \nstated: \n[S]ince  Plaintiffs  made  no  attempt  to  demonstrate  the  reasonableness  of  the \nexpense, the undersigned finds that some reduction of that large expense item is in \norder. The lack of a basis for determining whether the amount of the expense is \nreasonable or unreasonable is entirely due to Plaintiffs’ failure to meaningfully \naddress Defendants’ objection to the expense.  The recommended reduction in the \n“litigation services” expense is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, but that too is the \nresult of Plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate the reasonableness of the expense.  \n \n[Dkt. # 846 at 23-24].   \nThe Magistrate Judge noted that a charge for “data storage and hosting” for July 2009 in \nthe amount of $2,422 appears to have been charged twice. [Id. at 23].  Additionally, some of the \nentries are vaguely described as being “for services rendered.”  [Doc. 792-2, Ex. B at pp. 30-31], \nand throughout the entries, there are numerous instances of what appear to be double posting of \ncharges and subsequent removal of charges. The Magistrate Judge did not recommend a \nreduction for the “services rendered” billings, which he concluded appeared to be data storage \nand hosting charges.  [Dkt. #846 at 23].  However, he recommended a reduction of $2,442 for \nduplication of the July 2009 hosting fee.  [Id. at 24].  Further, because plaintiffs made no effort to \ndemonstrate the reasonableness of the overall expense for “litigation support,” the Magistrate \n14 \n \n\nJudge recommended a 25 percent reduction, or $47,183.74, for a total reduction in this category \nof expense of $49,625.74. [Id.]. \n  In their objection, defendants argue the $191,176.95 for “litigation support” should be \ndenied in its entirety because “[p]laintiffs have not sufficiently linked a payment from \nDefendants of nearly $200,000 to why or how this expense was necessary to Plaintiffs’ case.” \n[Dtk. #850 at 30]. \n  The court rejects defendants’ argument.  As the Magistrate Judge observed, cases \ninvolving voluminous electronic document production necessarily generate such costs.  Plaintiffs \nhave sufficiently established the costs were out-of-pocket expenses paid by Kaye Scholer to \nvendors for electronic document hosting and management.  The Magistrate Judge’s proposed 25 \npercent reduction adequately accounts for the deficiencies in documentation of the costs. \n \n2. Temporary Attorneys \n  Plaintiffs sought recovery of out-of-pocket expenses totaling $209,959.75 (representing \nover 3,800 hours) for temporary attorneys over a term of 20 weeks to assist in the review of \nnearly one million emails produced by defendants.  [Dkt. #791, Marcia Lowry Declaration, ¶ 17; \nDkt. #791-4 at 2, Ex. D, p. 1].  Lowry testified the emails were produced late in the case, and \ngiven the size and timing of the production, plaintiffs had no choice but to hire temporary \nattorneys in order to complete the review of the emails in time to use them for depositions and \nother discovery.  [Dkt. #843, TR at 172:18-173:3].  Plaintiffs billed the attorneys at the actual \ncost from the agency--$55 per hour.  [Id., TR at 173:3-6].  Lowry testified that if CR attorneys \nhad reviewed the emails, their rates would have been “well above” the $55 per hour rate charged \nby the agency.  [Id., TR at 173:114-20]. \n15 \n \n\nThe Magistrate Judge agreed the use of temporary attorneys was a cost savings over the \nrequested hourly rates for attorneys and paralegals.  However, because no time entries for the \ntemporary attorneys’ work were submitted, he concluded “there is no way for the court to \ndetermine whether the time was reasonable for the tasks, or even what tasks were performed.”  \n[Dkt. #846 at 25].  He recommended that the expense for temporary attorneys be reduced by 25 \npercent ($52,490). \n  Defendants argue that the temporary attorney costs should be entirely disallowed because \nattorney fees are not an “expense” under § 1988, no matter which attorneys are performing the \nwork.  Further, they assert plaintiffs’ documentation fails to establish the charges were \nreasonable.  This court agrees.  Rather than properly documenting and describing the time \nexpended by these temporary attorneys, Children’s Rights improperly seeks reimbursement for \nthe attorneys’ time as an “expense.”  Moreover, as the Magistrate Judge recognized, the 3,800 \nattorney hours allegedly spent by the temporary attorneys represents “an enormous expenditure \nof time for which there is no description of the work performed.”  Therefore, the court concludes \nthe claim for attorney fees characterized as “expenses” must be disallowed. \n \nVI. Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation [Dkt. \n#846] is accepted in part and rejected in part, as set forth above.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Award of \nClass Counsel Fees and Expenses [Dkt. #790] is granted.  Plaintiffs are awarded attorney fees \nand expenses in the total amount of $6,011,888.80, broken down as follows: \n  attorney fees in the amount of $4,813,772; \n  travel time of $139,500; \n16 \n \n\n  paralegal and intern time of $494,928; and \n  reimbursable expenses of $563,688.80. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 31st day of March, 2013. \n   \n \n    \n17 \n ",

Magistrate Judge McCarthy recommended plaintiffs be awarded attorney fees and \nexpenses totaling $7,031,928.  Defendants have raised four objections to the Magistrate Judge’s \nReport and Recommendation. [Dkt. #850]. \nI. Standard of Review \nThe district court must conduct a de novo review of the Magistrate Judge's Report and \nRecommendation.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Northington v. Marin, 102 F.3d 1564, 1570 (10th \nCir.1996) (“De novo review is required after a party makes timely written objections to a \nmagistrate's report.  The district court must consider the actual testimony or other evidence in the \nrecord and not merely review the magistrate's report and recommendations.”).  The court may \n\n“accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the \nmagistrate judge.”  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).   \n                                             II. Procedural Background \nThis class action was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of all foster children in \nthe legal custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (“DHS”) against members of \nthe Oklahoma Commission for Human Services and the director of DHS.  Plaintiff children sued \ndefendants in their official capacities, alleging policies and procedures adopted by defendants \nhave subjected foster children to significant, ongoing harm and risk of harm, deprivation of the \nchance for safe and stable childhoods and violation of their constitutional and statutory rights.  \nPlaintiffs asserted claims for violation of their substantive due process right under the \nFourteenth Amendment to be free from harm and risk of harm; violation of their liberty and \nprivacy rights guaranteed by the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments; and violation of their \nprocedural due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments based on deprivation \nof state law entitlements. [Dkt. #2]. Additionally, plaintiffs asserted claims for violation of the \nFederal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 621, et seq., and \nbreach of federal contractual obligations to third party beneficiaries.  [Id.]. The court granted \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss the last two claims.  [Dkt. #220].   \nOn May 5, 2009, the court, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, certified a class consisting of  \nall children who are or will be in the legal custody of DHS (1) due to a report or suspicion of \nabuse or neglect; or (2) who are or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.  [Dkt. \n#272 at 17].   \nOn December 1, 2011, the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on \nplaintiffs’ claims for violation of liberty and privacy rights and violation of their procedural due \n2 \n \n\nprocess rights.  [Dkt. #741].  The court denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment with \nrespect to plaintiffs’ claim for violation of their substantive due process rights.  [Id.]. \nOn January 4, 2012, the case settled.  [Dkt. #768].  The Compromise and Settlement \nAgreement (“Settlement Agreement”) executed by the parties contained the following \nprovisions: \n1.2  Class Counsel shall mean Angela R. Vicari,  Frederic Dorwart, Ira P. \nLustbader, John S. Cahalan, Marcia R.  Lowry, Paul DeMuro, Phillip A. Geraci, \nR. Thomas Seymour, Scott A. Graham, William Kapell, Miriam F. Ingber, Patrick \nS. Almonrode, Jodi K. Miller, Laurence D. Borten, Philip G. Barber, and Sarah T. \nRusso. \n \n1.3  Class  Counsel Fees and Expenses  shall  mean reason able  fees an d \nexpenses of Class Counsel in an amount to be determined by the Court, provided \nthe services and expenses of Frederic Dorwart Lawyers have been and will be \nprovided pro bono for the benefit of the Pl aintiff Class. The  Court shall retain \njurisdiction to make this determination.  The Named Plaintiffs and Next Friends \nshall not seek or be aw arded compensation in return for their role in the Class  \nAction Litigation.  Settling Defendant stipulates that Class Counsel  is entitled to \nClass Counsel Fees and Expenses but rese rves the right to dispute the amount of \nClass Counsel Fees and Expenses.   \n [Dkt. #770-1]. \n[Dkt. #770-1 at 3].   \n  In the pending motion, plaintiffs seek an award of reasonable attorney fees under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and ¶ 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement.  They requested an award of $8,345,588 \nfor 36,188 billable hours1 and $1,174,831 in reimbursable expenses, for a total of $9,520,419.  \nDefendants opposed the motion, arguing that neither the hourly rates nor the number of hours \nwere reasonable, and asserting that the court should either disallow an award entirely or limit the \namount of the award to between $2.6 and $3.7 million.   \n                                                 \n1 Total plaintiffs’ attorney hours were 39,822 (excluding 2,246 hours of the Dorwart firm’s time and 4,007 hours of \nKaye Scholer’s time (both pro bono), and 3,817 hours spent by “temporary attorneys,” for which plaintiffs seek \nrecovery as an expense). [Dkt. #790 at 8]. Plaintiffs, in their exercise of billing judgment, excluded 3,634 hours of \ntime expended by Children’s Rights attorneys.  [Dkt. #791, Marcia Lowry Dec., ¶ 12].  Defendants’ counsel (Riggs, \nAbney and Crowe & Dunlevy) expended 38,850 hours on the case, exclusive of work by DHS staff and in-house \ncounsel.  [Dkt. #790 at 25]. \n \n3 \n \n\nThe attorney fee motion was referred to Magistrate Judge McCarthy, who issued a Report \nand Recommendation.  Defendants have filed four objections.   \nIII. Magistrate Judge’s Recommendation \n  The Magistrate Judge recommended that: \n1.  The court reject defendants’ argument that plaintiffs may only recover fees \nand expenses for the attorneys specifically named as “Class Counsel” in ¶ 1.2 \nof the Settlement Agreement. [Dkt. #846 at 3-4]. \n \n2.  The court reject defendants’ argument that the fee award should be reduced \nbecause only one of the five claims asserted in the complaint survived \ndismissal and/or summary judgment. [Id. at 5]. \n \n3.  The court reject defendants’ argument that the overall fee award be reduced \nbased on alleged unethical conduct by plaintiffs’ attorneys in communicating \nwith Steven Dow, a member of the Oklahoma Commission for Human \nServices. [Id. at 5-6]. \n  \n4.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys be paid for travel time at a rate of $50 per hour and \nreimbursed for reasonable travel expenses. [Id. at 8]. \n \n5.  Local hourly rates of up to $300 be applied to all of plaintiffs’ attorneys, \nexcept that a rate of $450 per hour should apply to Marcia R. Lowry; and the \ncourt accept defendants’ expert report on the rates for the individual attorneys. \n[Id. at 9-11]. \n \n6.  Local hourly rates of $60-$75 per hour be applied to paralegal and intern time, \nfor an average of $70 per hour, as recommended by defendants’ expert. [Id. at \n12]. \n \n7.  The court reduce plaintiffs’ total lodestar fee2 of $6,017,215 by 7.5 percent (as \nsuggested by plaintiffs’ expert) to account for inadequate descriptions of tasks \nin billing entries, duplication of effort and lack of billing judgment. [Id. at 15-\n16]. \n \n8.  A total 209 of the 9,047 hours of paralegal time be eliminated because it \nrepresented work that was secretarial in nature and not separately billable to a \nclient; and the remaining 8,838 hours be reduced by 7.5 percent based on lack \nof billing judgment.  [Id. at 15-16]. \n \n                                                 \n2 The lodestar is determined by multiplying the hours reasonably expended by plaintiffs’ counsel on the litigation by \na reasonable hourly rate.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983); Case v. Unified School Dist. No. 233, \nJohnson County, 157 F.3d 1243, 1249 (10th Cir. 1998). \n4 \n \n\n9.  The court award attorney fees totaling $5,596,010, paralegal/intern fees \ntotaling $572,260; and travel fees totaling $139,500. [Id. at 16-17]. \n \n10. Plaintiffs’ request for reimbursement of expenses totaling $1,174,831 be \nreduced by $450,672, with reductions broken down as follows:   \n \n  costs recoverable under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (requiring filing of a bill of \ncosts)--$193,267.60; \n  expert deposition preparation--$65,571.183 (should be $68,571.18) \n  litigation support--$16,450.13; \n  conference meals--$546.69; \n  working meals--$6,576.22; \n  other inappropriate meal requests--$3,000.00; \n  other transportation--$50,121.87; \n  travel agent fees--$2,100.00 \n  cancelled flights--$7,050.00 \n  Amtrak charges--$825.00 \n  Kaye Scholer law firm inappropriate charges for travel and meals--\n$3,048.02; \n  Kaye Scholer law firm litigation expense--$49,625.74; \n  Temporary attorneys--$52,490.00. [Id. at 28]. \n \n \n11. Overall, the Magistrate Judge recommended an award to plaintiffs of attorney \nfees and expenses in the total amount of $7,031,928, broken down as follows: \n \n  Attorney fees of $5,596,010; \n  Travel time of $139,500; \n  Paralegal and intern time of $572,260; and \n  Reimbursable expenses of $724,158  [Id.]. \n \nIV. Defendants’ Objections \n \n  Defendants object to the Report and Recommendation on the following bases:  (A) the \nMagistrate Judge erred as a matter of law in recommending an award of fees for attorneys not \nidentified in the Settlement Agreement as “Class Counsel;” (B) the Magistrate Judge erred as a \nmatter of law and ignored the clear weight of evidence in failing to recommend a reduction in \nfees for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ alleged inappropriate contact with Steven Dow; (C) the \n                                                 \n3 The Magistrate Judge recommended excluding $68,571.18 in expert deposition preparations, but deducted only \n$65,571.18. [Dkt. #846 at 19-20].  The entire $68,571.18 is excluded in the court’s calculations. \n5 \n \n\nrecommended reduction of 7.5 percent to plaintiffs’ requested fee award is insufficient;  and (D) \nplaintiffs’ claimed expenses for temporary attorneys and Kaye Scholer’s litigation support \nshould be disallowed in their entirety. \nV. Analysis \nA. Award of Fees for Work by Attorneys Not Listed as “Class Counsel” \n  Defendants argue that under ¶ 1.2 and ¶ 1.3 of the Settlement Agreement, plaintiffs \nwaived their right to seek legal fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for work by attorneys not listed as \n“Class Counsel” in ¶ 1.2.   \nThe Supreme Court has held that a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights action “should \nordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circumstances would render an award unjust.”  \nEllis v. University of Kansas Medical Center, 163 F.3d 1186, 1200 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).  The presumption in favor of attorneys’ fees \nmay be overcome by waiver of fees by the prevailing plaintiff.  Id.  However, “[a]bsent express \nlanguage in the settlement agreement waiving the right to recover attorney fees, the intent of the \nparties governs.” Id. \n  Waiver is “the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right.”  Barringer v. \nBaptist Healthcare of Oklahoma, 22 P.3d 695, 700-01 (Okla. 2010) (quoting Faulkenberry v. \nKansas City Southern Ry. Co. 602 P.2d 203, 206-07 (Okla. 1979).  “The doctrine is essentially a \nmatter of intention, focusing on the intent of the party against whom waiver is asserted.”  Id.  \nWaiver can be accomplished either expressly or implicitly, but an implied waiver requires “a \nclear, unequivocal and decisive manifestation of the party’s relinquishment of the right.”  Id. “No \none can be bound by a waiver of one’s rights unless it was made with full knowledge of the \nrights intended to be waived.” Faulkenberry, 602 P.2d at 207. \n6 \n \n\n  Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 do not expressly waive plaintiffs’ right to seek recovery of \nattorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for non-listed attorneys.  As the Magistrate Judge correctly \nnoted, Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 neither mention § 1988, nor waive the right to seek statutory fees \nfor non-listed attorneys.  In Paragraph 1.3, the “Settling Defendant,” the Oklahoma Commission \nfor Human Services, stipulates that Class Counsel are entitled to fees and expenses; the language \nof the paragraph in no way limits plaintiffs’ right to seek fees under § 1988 for non-listed \nattorneys.   \nNor, in this court’s view, can Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 be fairly read to constitute an \nimplied waiver.  The language in the paragraphs simply falls short of “a clear, unequivocal and \ndecisive manifestation of [plaintiffs’] relinquishment of the right” [to seek fees under § 1988 for \nnon-listed attorneys].  Barringer, 22 P.3d at 701.   \nThe court concludes that plaintiffs did not waive their right to seek attorney fees under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 for attorneys not listed as “Class Counsel” in Paragraph 1.2 of the Settlement \nAgreement. \n \nB. Reduction for Communications with Steven Dow and DHS Personnel \n  Defendants seek a significant reduction in the fee award due to plaintiffs’ counsels’ \nunauthorized contact with represented defendants.  Specifically, they contend plaintiffs’ counsel \nviolated Oklahoma Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 by communicating with DHS \nCommissioner Steven Dow and DHS personnel without the consent of DHS counsel or a court \norder authorizing such communication.   \nTime records produced by attorneys for Children’s Rights contained numerous entries \nconcerning communications between plaintiffs’ attorneys and confidential sources or informants.  \n7 \n \n\nIn connection with the attorney fee motion, defendants sought to compel production of \ndocuments disclosing the identities of the confidential sources.  [Dkt. #804].  The Magistrate \nJudge conducted an in camera review of the list of confidential sources before ruling on the \nmotion to compel. [Dkt. #812].   \nIn his Report and Recommendation on the attorney fee motion, the Magistrate Judge \nobserved that Dow was not on the list of names of “confidential sources” and “with the exception \nof one individual identified as a supervisor, the sources were case workers or other front line \nemployees.”  [Dkt. #846 at 6].  Further, with respect to communications by Dorwart and/or \nLowry with Dow, the court found “the evidence did not establish that there were any \nunauthorized discussions between Plaintiffs’ attorneys and Mr. Dow regarding this litigation” \nand “[t]here is, therefore, no basis for a reduction the fee award for unethical conduct with \nrespect to Mr. Dow, or otherwise.”  [Id.].     \n  With respect to communications with confidential sources, defendants assert the \nMagistrate Judge’s review of plaintiffs’ in camera submission was “insufficient to fully address \nthe Rule 4.2 Issue,” and speculate plaintiffs did not submit all information the Magistrate  Judge \nordered them to produce for in camera review.  [Dkt. #850 at 22].  They state, “In other words, \nthe R&R reflects that Plaintiffs’ counsel has not submitted descriptions of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \ncontact with Mr. Dow or with any other DHS-affiliated individual, unless that individual also \nhappened to be named as a ‘source’ by Children’s Rights on a time record filed with the Court.”  \n[Id. at 23]. \n  The court declines to second guess the adequacy of the list submitted to the Magistrate \nJudge for in camera review.  The Magistrate Judge reviewed the list in connection with the \nmotion to compel.  He determined none of the people identified on the list were of a level to raise \n8 \n \n\nRule 4.2 issues.  Plaintiffs turned over the time records indicating Dorwart’s contacts with Dow, \nand both Dorwart and Lowry testified about the nature and extent of their communications with \nDow.   \n  Dow was appointed as a member of the Human Services Commission on November 25, \n2009.  [Dkt. #850, Ex. 5].  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d), he was automatically substituted as \na party in this lawsuit.  Time records from the Dorwart firm confirm telephone calls between \nDorwart and Dow on December 16, 2009, and March 2, 2010.  [Dkt. #850, Ex. 7].  Additionally, \na March 8, 2010, entry stated, in pertinent part, “work on care package to Mr. Dow.”  [Id.].  The \ntime records indicate that subsequently, on November 19-21, 2010, numerous emails and \ntelephone calls occurred among Dorwart, Dow and Don Bingham, counsel for defendants.  [Id.].4  \n  Dorwart testified at the hearing that he and Dow are friends and otherwise professionally \nassociated and speak frequently.  [Dkt. #843, TR at 80:24-25].  He testified that in the December \n16, 2009, Dow told him he had long expressed a desire to go on the commission and that DHS \nDirector Howard Hendrick opposed Dow coming on the commission.  [Id., TR at 81:4-23].  The \nMarch 8, 2010 care package for Dow, according to Dorwart, included a number of the filed \npleadings in this case and a copy of the consent decree entered of record in the Tennessee case.  \n[Id., TR at 85:3-11].  Dorwart testified he had talked to Dow sometime before and Dow \nexpressed his desire to see the pleadings in the case so that when he went on the commission he \nwould know what was going on.  [Id., TR at 85:12-17].  Dorwart testified that to his knowledge, \nDow was not serving as a commissioner at the time he sent him the care package.  [Id., TR at \n                                                 \n4 The entry for 12/16/09 states, in pertinent part:  “Teleconference with Steven Dow regarding appointment to DHS \nCommission.” [Dkt. #850, Ex. 7 at pp. 32-33].  The entry for 3/2/10 states, in pertinent part:  “teleconference with \nSteven Dow.”  [Id. at 34]. An entry on 11/19/10 states “Multiple emails to Messrs. Dow and Bingham [DHS \ncounsel] concerning scheduling settlement discussion.” [Id. at 36] The entry for 11/20/10 states “Teleconference \nwith and emails x3 to Mr. Dow concerning settlement discussions.” [Id.]. The entry for 11/21/10 states \n“Teleconference with Mr. Dow and emails x4 to Messrs. Dow and Bingham concerning settlement.” [Id.] \n9 \n \n\n86:12-14].5  In any event, Dorwart’s testimony that he had no substantive discussions with Dow \nregarding this lawsuit is uncontroverted.    \n  Lowry testified she had no substantive communications with Dow.  [Id., TR at 209:19-\n25].  Neither Dorwart nor anyone else communicated to her any discussions they had with Dow.  \n[Id., TR at 210:1-6].   \n  After consideration of the arguments of counsel, together with the testimony and \nevidence presented, this court concludes that any attorney fee award need not be reduced based \non counsels’ contact with Mr. Dow and DHS personnel. \n \nC. Lodestar Reduction \n  In the hearing before the Magistrate Judge, defendants argued for a 30 to 50 percent \nreduction in plaintiffs’ requested fees, and experts for both sides agreed some reduction is \nappropriate.  Defendants’ expert recommended a reduction of 30 percent. [Dkt. #844, TR at \n422:19-20].  Plaintiffs’ expert testified that if he were in the shoes of the court, he would reduce \nthe Children’s Rights attorney fees by 7.5 percent “because of potential duplication of effort or \nitems that were excessive.”  [Dkt. #844, TR at 288:1-25].   \nThe Magistrate Judge recognized serious issues with plaintiffs’ descriptions of tasks in \nbilling entries, duplication of effort, and a lack of billing judgment.  In particular, he noted that—\naccording to defendants—the Children’s Rights attorneys, in more than 840 time entries \nrepresenting $198,414.75 in fees, allocated time to communications with unidentified “sources,” \nand he concluded the entries were too vague to evaluate whether the time spent was reasonable.  \n                                                 \n5 However, Dow had been appointed November 5, 2009, and attended a commission meeting on February 23, 2010.  \n[Dkt. #850, Ex. 6, Minutes of February 23, 2010 Executive Session of the Oklahoma Commission for Human \nService meeting]. \n \n10 \n \n\n[Dkt. #846 at 13].   Further, he observed that defendants had identified over 1,900 billing entries \nfor attorney Kapell that contain the description “electronic mail” and little other detail about the \nsubstance of the work performed, and $36,066.34 in attorney time which defendants argued is \nnot recoverable as it was devoted to non-substantive tasks such as organizing and training \nattorneys.  [Id.].  The Magistrate Judge adopted and recommended plaintiffs’ experts’ \nsuggestion—a reduction of 7.5 percent.  [Dkt. #846 at 15].   \nDefendants argue the recommended 7.5 percent reduction is “meager” and “considerably \nbelow the range of reductions” in other cases. [Dkt. #850 at 9, 11].  They contend the plaintiffs’ \nattorneys’ lodestar should be reduced by at least 25 percent.  [Id. at 10].6  Defendants also \ncontend the requested fees should be reduced because plaintiffs ultimately prevailed on only one \nof their five claims.   \nAlthough the court may reduce a lodestar calculation on the grounds that plaintiffs have \nachieved only partial success, many civil rights cases involve multiple claims “based on a \ncommon core of facts . . . or related legal theories.”  Robinson v. City of Edmond, 160 F.3d 1275, \n1283 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435 (1983). The Tenth \nCircuit has held “that when a plaintiff achieves the principal goal of her lawsuit, lack of success \non some of her interrelated claims may not be used as a basis for reducing the plaintiff’s fee \naward.” Robinson, 160 F.3d at 1283. \n  The court concurs with the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that the facts supporting the \nsuccessful claim were intertwined with the unsuccessful ones.  Therefore, it rejects defendants’ \nargument that a reduction for plaintiffs’ unsuccessful claims is appropriate.   \n                                                 \n6 Further, defendants correctly assert there is an arithmetic error in the calculation of the reduction at pages 16-17 of \nthe Report and Recommendation, and that a 7.5 percent reduction in the subtotal figure of $6,017,215 amounts to a \nreduction of $451,291 (rounded to the nearest dollar) instead of $421,205, as stated on pages 17-18 of the Report \nand Recommendation.   \n11 \n \n\n  This court also concurs with the Magistrate Judge that a reduction in the overall fee \naward is justified by the lack of billing judgment found in the fee request.   Plaintiffs bear the \nburden to prove the reasonableness of “each dollar, each hour, above zero” in their fee request. \nMars v. Credit Bureau of Raton, 801 F.2d 1197, 1210 (10th Cir. 1986).  Their fee application \ncontains numerous deficiencies which undermine their request.  After an independent review of \nthe billing statements, the exhibits, and the testimony presented, this court concludes that a 20 \npercent reduction of the base fee of $6,017,215 is reasonable and appropriate.7  This percentage \nwas determined by considering (1) the lack of billing judgment referenced by the Magistrate \nJudge, including billing entries that do not detail the work performed, and attorney time devoted \nto organizing and training attorneys; (2) the excessive fees Children’s Rights sought for class \ncertification, insofar as the class was provisionally certified without much difficulty, and \nconsidering the significant pro bono assistance plaintiffs received on the issue from Kaye \nScholar;8 (3) the inefficiencies incumbent with high turnover rates of attorneys and staff at \nChildren’s Rights;9 (4) the absence of monthly or periodic billing reviews at Children’s Rights, \nresulting in vague, insufficiently detailed, and excessive billing; (5) duplicative billing entries by \nmultiple attorneys for the same task; and (6) plaintiffs’ failure to provide documentation or \ndescription of the 3,634 hours they wrote off,  making it difficult to evaluate the adequacy of \ntheir exercise of billing judgment.  As a result, the plaintiffs are awarded a reasonable attorney \nfee in the amount of $4,813,772.  Similarly, the court concludes total fees for paralegal/intern \n                                                 \n7 This reduction is consistent with the lodestar reduction in Kenny A. v. Perdue, 454 F. Supp.2d 1260, 1286 (N.D. \nGa. 2006) (ordering 15% reduction in number of non-travel related hours claimed by plaintiffs’ counsel).  \n  \n8 The Kaye Scholer firm reported $236,000 in billable time on the class certification issue.  [Dkt. #844, TR at \n426:14-2]. \n \n9 Defendants’ expert James Sturdivant, testified, based on his review of plaintiffs’ records that only two Children’s \nRights attorneys were at the firm for the entirety of the lawsuit; six came after the case was filed and remained to the \nend; and 37 other timekeepers came and went during the pendency of the case. [Dkt. #844, TR at 424:14-22]. \n12 \n \n\ntime should be reduced by 20 percent.  The requested fee of $618,660 is therefore reduced to an \naward of $494,928 for paralegal and intern time.   \n \nD. Expenses for Kaye Scholar’s Litigation Support and for “Temp Attorneys” \nWhile only those items listed under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 may be awarded as costs, other out-\nof-pocket expenses incurred during litigation may be awarded as attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § \n1988 if (1) the expenses are not absorbed as part of the law firm overhead but are normally billed \nto a private client, and (2) the expenses are reasonable.  Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F.3d 1505, 1517 \n(10th Cir. 1995). \n1. Data Storage Costs   \n Plaintiffs sought reimbursement of a total of $262,120 for out-of-pocket expenses of the \nKaye Scholer law firm.  Phillip Geraci, the Kaye Scholer partner who supervised the firm’s work \non this case, declared that the firm incurred the expenses in connection with this action.  [Dkt. \n#792, Phillip A. Geraci Dec., ¶ 4].   Included in the out-of-pocket expenses was $191,176.95 for \n“litigation support.” Geraci, in his declaration, stated:   \nThe  largest catego ry  of  reimbursable  expenses  incurred by Kaye Scholer in \nconnection  with this litigation was for  litigation  support, which consisted of \npayments to Plaintiffs’ vendor for computerized data loading, storing and hosting \ncharges with respect to  the millions of pages of records obtained by  Plaintiffs \nduring the discovery phase of the case. \n \n[Id., Geraci Dec., ¶ 7].  Exhibit B to the Geraci Declaration is an itemized list of individual \nexpenses.  It includes eight pages listing payments to three vendors, Iris Data Services, LLC, \nEverest Technologies Co., LLC, and TechLaw Solutions, Inc. for “Litigation Support.”   \nAt the hearing on plaintiffs’ fee motion, attorney Lowry testified the Kaye Scholar firm \nprovided litigation support, “which was…a hosting system for the data and for the electronic \n13 \n \n\ndata that we had collected.  And they maintained that, and we loaded our data onto that hosting \nsystem.”  [Dkt. #843, TR at 163:18-22].  Further, she stated: \nBut I do know personally that the data th at we were collecting through electronic \ndiscovery was going up on a  system, a computer system that Kaye Scholer was  \npaying for.  And that was obviously an essential part of the case, to be able to \nhandle the electronic discovery.    \n \n[Id., TR at 168:5-11].   \nThe Magistrate Judge concluded that, considering the volume of the data production in \nthis case, some expense was necessarily incurred to manage data [Dkt. #846 at 23].  However, he \nstated: \n[S]ince  Plaintiffs  made no at tempt  to  demonstrate  the  reasonableness  of the  \nexpense, the undersigned finds that some reduction of that large expense item is in \norder. The lack of a basis for determ ining whether the amount of the expense is \nreasonable or unreasonable is entirely due  to Plaintiffs’ failure to meaningfully \naddress Defendants’ objection to the expense.  The recommended reduction in the \n“litigation services” expense is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, but that too is the \nresult of Plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate the reasonableness of the expense.  \n \n[Dkt. # 846 at 23-24].   \nThe Magistrate Judge noted that a charge for “data storage and hosting” for July 2009 in \nthe amount of $2,422 appears to have been charged twice. [Id. at 23].  Additionally, some of the \nentries are vaguely described as being “for services rendered.”  [Doc. 792-2, Ex. B at pp. 30-31], \nand throughout the entries, there are numerous instances of what appear to be double posting of \ncharges and subsequent removal of charges. The Magistrate Judge did not recommend a \nreduction for the “services rendered” billings, which he concluded appeared to be data storage \nand hosting charges.  [Dkt. #846 at 23].  However, he recommended a reduction of $2,442 for \nduplication of the July 2009 hosting fee.  [Id. at 24].  Further, because plaintiffs made no effort to \ndemonstrate the reasonableness of the overall expense for “litigation support,” the Magistrate \n14 \n \n\nJudge recommended a 25 percent reduction, or $47,183.74, for a total reduction in this category \nof expense of $49,625.74. [Id.]. \n  In their objection, defendants argue the $191,176.95 for “litigation support” should be \ndenied in its entirety because “[p]laintiffs have not sufficiently linked a payment from \nDefendants of nearly $200,000 to why or how this expense was necessary to Plaintiffs’ case.” \n[Dtk. #850 at 30]. \n  The court rejects defendants’ argument.  As the Magistrate Judge observed, cases \ninvolving voluminous electronic document production necessarily generate such costs.  Plaintiffs \nhave sufficiently established the costs were out-of-pocket expenses paid by Kaye Scholer to \nvendors for electronic document hosting and management.  The Magistrate Judge’s proposed 25 \npercent reduction adequately accounts for the deficiencies in documentation of the costs. \n \n2. Temporary Attorneys \n  Plaintiffs sought recovery of out-of-pocket expenses totaling $209,959.75 (representing \nover 3,800 hours) for temporary attorneys over a term of 20 weeks to assist in the review of \nnearly one million emails produced by defendants.  [Dkt. #791, Marcia Lowry Declaration, ¶ 17; \nDkt. #791-4 at 2, Ex. D, p. 1].  Lowry testified the emails were produced late in the case, and \ngiven the size and timing of the production, plaintiffs had no choice but to hire temporary \nattorneys in order to complete the review of the emails in time to use them for depositions and \nother discovery.  [Dkt. #843, TR at 172:18-173:3].  Plaintiffs billed the attorneys at the actual \ncost from the agency--$55 per hour.  [Id., TR at 173:3-6].  Lowry testified that if CR attorneys \nhad reviewed the emails, their rates would have been “well above” the $55 per hour rate charged \nby the agency.  [Id., TR at 173:114-20]. \n15 \n \n\nThe Magistrate Judge agreed the use of temporary attorneys was a cost savings over the \nrequested hourly rates for attorneys and paralegals.  However, because no time entries for the \ntemporary attorneys’ work were submitted, he concluded “there is no way for the court to \ndetermine whether the time was reasonable for the tasks, or even what tasks were performed.”  \n[Dkt. #846 at 25].  He recommended that the expense for temporary attorneys be reduced by 25 \npercent ($52,490). \n  Defendants argue that the temporary attorney costs should be entirely disallowed because \nattorney fees are not an “expense” under § 1988, no matter which attorneys are performing the \nwork.  Further, they assert plaintiffs’ documentation fails to establish the charges were \nreasonable.  This court agrees.  Rather than properly documenting and describing the time \nexpended by these temporary attorneys, Children’s Rights improperly seeks reimbursement for \nthe attorneys’ time as an “expense.”  Moreover, as the Magistrate Judge recognized, the 3,800 \nattorney hours allegedly spent by the temporary attorneys represents “an enormous expenditure \nof time for which there is no description of the work performed.”  Therefore, the court concludes \nthe claim for attorney fees characterized as “expenses” must be disallowed. \n \nVI. Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation [Dkt. \n#846] is accepted in part and rejected in part, as set forth above.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Award of \nClass Counsel Fees and Expenses [Dkt. #790] is granted.  Plaintiffs are awarded attorney fees \nand expenses in the total amount of $6,011,888.80, broken down as follows: \n  attorney fees in the amount of $4,813,772; \n  travel time of $139,500; \n16 \n \n\n  paralegal and intern time of $494,928; and \n  reimbursable expenses of $563,688.80. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 31st day of March, 2013. \n   \n \n    \n17 \n ",

Henry, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2009)   \n2009 WL 1011595 \n \nStandard of Review  As a general rule, a suit brought as a class action must be \ndismissed for mootness when the personal claims of the \nSummary  judgment  is  appropriate  “if  the  pleadings,  named  plaintiffs  are  satisfied  and  no  class  has  been \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on  properly certified, Reed v.

However, there are certain exceptions to \nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the  this rule. As previously stated, plaintiffs contend two of \nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  those  exceptions  apply  in  this  case.  First,  they  argue \nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). When applying this standard, a court  plaintiffs’  claims,  including  D.G.’s,  are  “so  inherently \nmust  examine  the  factual  record  and  reasonable  transitory that the trial court will not have even enough \ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the  time to rule on a motion for class certification before the \nparty opposing summary judgment.

The \nremaining  eight  plaintiffs,  who  are  all  still  in  DHS \nAnalysis \ncustody,  assert  identical  constitutional  violations  and \nrequest the same prospective injunctive relief sought by \nDefendants argue that since D.G. is no longer in the \nD.G.

No delay or omission by any party in exercising any of their rights under \nthis  Settlement Agreement will operate as  a waiver of that or any other right.  A waiver or \nconsent given by a party on anyone occasion is effective only in that instance and will not be \nconstrued as  a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion, unless otherwise agreed in \nwriting. \n2.7  Nature of Agreement.  This  Settlement Agreement shall be  binding  and  enforceable \nagainst the parties, but it is not, nor shall it be construed to be, a consent decree. \n2.8.  Co-Neutrals. \n(a) The Co-Neutrals shall act as arbiters of any dispute between the parties arising out of this \nSettlement Agreement, whether or not the subject matter of the dispute is specifically \nidentified herein.

The Co-Neutrals shall also have free and complete access to the staff of DHS; \nits  divisions  and  any  successor  agencies  or  divisions;  persons  within  the  executive \nbranch;  and DHS  shall  facilitate  access  to  private agencies  working  with DHS;  and \nchildren in the custody ofDHS. \n(e) After execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Department shall, as soon as practical, \nretain  the  services  of the  Co-Neutrals  for  the  period  of the  Settlement Agreement; \nhowever, the Co-Neutrals may begin work under the Settlement Agreement as soon as it \nis  approved  by  the  Contingency  Review  Board  (as  contemplated  in  Section  5.10). \nPayment of the Co-Neutrals shall be addressed as follows: (1) The Department shall enter \ninto a professional services contract to secure payment of the Co-Neutrals, and the first \nsuch contract shall be for a period of not less than one year with the option to renew on \nan annual basis up to three years; and (2) As part ofthe professional services contract, the \nCo-Neutrals shall have a budget and staff sufficient to allow the Co-Neutrals to carry out \nthe responsibilities described in the Settlement Agreement, and may contract with such \nexperts or consultants as the Co-Neutrals may deem appropriate. The Co-Neutrals agree \nto reasonable and customary fees  and to  actual expenses which will be reimbursable \npursuant to the terms of the professional services contract. Nothing in this Settlement \nAgreement shall be read to prevent the involvement of a foundation or other third party in \nthe funding of all or part of the annual expense of the Co-Neutrals' work pursuant to this \nSettlement Agreement (whether or not a professional services contract is executed). \n(f) The Co-Neutrals are not a state or local agency or an agent thereof, and accordingly the \nrecords maintained by the Co-Neutrals shall not be deemed public records subject to \npublic inspection. Neither the Co-Neutrals nor any person or entity hired or otherwise \nretained by the Co-Neutrals to assist in furthering any provision of this Agreement shall \nbe liable for any claim, lawsuit, or demand arising out of the Co-Neutrals' good-faith \nperformance  pursuant to  this  Agreement.  Except  as  otherwise  required by  law,  any \nreports, opinions, or documents used or prepared by the Co-Neutrals or their staff shall be \nused for the purposes of this case only and may not be used for  any other purpose, \nwithout the prior written consent of Defendant. \n2.9  Enforcement of Co-Neutral Decision. With the written majority agreement of the Co \nNeutrals (and only with such agreement), any decision of the Co-Neutrals may be presented to \nthe Court for entry as a judgment in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FAA. The \nparties acknowledge that the FAA may, or may not, apply to the subject matter of the Lawsuit; \ntherefore,  the  parties  expressly incorporate the  procedural provisions  of the FAA into  this \nSettlement Agreement as if those provisions were expressly set forth herein,  except that the \nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement control in the event of any inconsistencies between the \nFAA and the Settlement Agreement. A decision of the Co-Neutrals can be vacated by the Court \nonly upon a judicial determination that one or  more of the  grounds  set forth in 9 U.S.C.  § \n10(a)(1)-(4) exists. Once a decision of the Co-Neutrals has been entered as a judgment by the \nCourt, it may be enforced by Class Counsel, the Class Representatives and the Plaintiff Class. \n6 \n\n2.10  Child Welfare Plan. \n(a) By March 30, 2012 the Department shall submit a child welfare plan (\"Plan\") to the Co \nNeutrals and Class Plaintiffs and provide a copy to counsel for the Group Homes (as defined \nin dkt. #2). The Department may consult with the Co-Neutrals during the Plan development \nprocess. The Governor of Oklahoma may designate members of her staff and the Speaker of \nthe Oklahoma House of Representative and President Pro Tempore of the Senate may select \nmembers of the Legislature who will participate in the development of the Plan. The Plan \nwill set forth:  specific  strategies to  improve the child welfare system as  it relates to the \nPerformance  Areas  (as  defined below);  specific  structural  and/or  organizational  changes \nneeded to implement the strategies; and the anticipated· cost for implementation. The Plan \nmust  specifically  target,  but  need  not  be  limited  to,  the  following  performance  areas \n(\"Performance Areas\"): \n(1) child abuse and neglect in care, \n(2) the number of foster homes available for children in need of \ntherapeutic care, \n(3) the number of foster homes available for children not in need of \ntherapeutic care, \n(4) visitation of children by case workers, \n(5) continuity of visitation by the same case worker, \n(6) on an annual basis, the average number of placements experienced by \na child two years old or older, excluding the ten percent of children with \nthe least number of changes in placement and the ten percent of children \nwith the highest number of changes in placement, \n(7) the actual number of placements for each child two years old or older \nthat is in the ten percent of children two years old or older with the highest \nnumber of changes in placements, \n(8) on an annual basis, the average number of placements experienced by \na child under two years old, excluding the ten percent of children with the \nleast  number  of placements  and  the  ten percent  of children  with the \nhighest number of placements, \n(9) the actual number of placements for each child under two years old \nwho is in the ten percent of children under two years old with the highest \nnumber of placements, \n(10)  as  of March  31  and  September  30  of each year,  the  number  of \nchildren in shelters delineated by even ages (i.e., younger than 2 years, 2 \nyears old to 4 years old, 4 years old to 6 years old, ... ), \n(11) during the same six month time period (April through September and \nOctober through March), the average stay in a shelter for each age group \nidentified in subparagraph (10), excluding the ten percent of children with \nthe  shortest stay in a shelter and the ten percent of children with the \n7 \n\nlongest stay in a shelter, \n(12) the actual length of stay for each child that is in the ten percent of \nchildren with the longest stay in a shelter, \n(13) permanency (i.e., the child exits the system with a connection to a \npermanent family), \n(14) adoption, including adoption failure rates, and \n(15) caseload. \n(b) The Department shall consult with the Co-Neutrals to identify a data expert to establish \nbaseline measures and target outcomes for the Performance Areas. It is permissible for the \nexpert to be an existing consultant to, or employee of, the Department, but the expert shall be \nsubject to the Co-Neutral's approval. The Department's engagement of an expert should occur \nno later than one month after the signing of this Settlement Agreement. The expert will work \nwith the Department to  develop its internal  capacity to  report on the Performance Areas \nidentified above, and in the Plan. The Co-Neutrals will meet with the Department and the \nExpert to ascertain progress towards the development of the Plan, as needed. \n(c) The Department shall share drafts of the Plan routinely with the Co-Neutrals,  and as \nrequested  by  the  Co-Neutrals.  The  Plan  may  incorporate  existing  planning  goals  and \npriorities of the Department. \n(d) The Co-Neutrals will hold discussion meetings with the Department and Class Plaintiffs \n(the \"Progress Update Meetings\"). These Progress Update Meetings will be an opportunity to \napprise Class Plaintiffs of progress on the implementation of the Plan and to discuss and \nresolve any concerns. It is contemplated that the Progress Update Meetings will occur at least \non a quarterly basis and will begin after the acceptance of the Plan by the Co-Neutrals and \nwill continue until the Settlement Agreement Terminates in accordance with Section 2.15; \nhowever, the date, time, and length of such meetings, and the number of such meetings, shall \nbe left to the sole discretion of the Co-Neutrals. \n(e) The  Class  Plaintiffs  shall  have  fifteen  (15)  days  to  submit comments  regarding the \nproposed Plan to the Co-Neutrals. The Co-Neutrals shall, thereafter, review the Plan and, \nwithin 30 days, endorse the Plan or decline to endorse the Plan. The Department may seek \nfunding for the Plan from the Oklahoma State Legislature at any time, including during the \nreview period. \n(f) I fthe Co-Neutrals endorse the Plan, then the Department shall have 75 days to submit a \nreport  to  the  Co-Neutrals  and to  the  Class  Plaintiffs.  The  report  shall  identify  specific \nbaseline measurements with respect to each of the Performance Areas identified in Section \n2.10(a) (\"Baselines\") and  specific target outcomes  and/or performance standards (\"Target \nOutcomes\").  Any  Performance  Area  contained  in  the  Plan but  which  is  not  expressly \nidentified  in  Section  2.1O(a)  may  be  included  in  the  Department's  report,  but  such \nPerformance Area shall not be a mandatory part of the implementation of this Settlement \nAgreement and cannot form the basis of a violation, although the Co-Neutrals may consider \nthe Department's efforts toward such Performance Area(s) when determining whether the \nDepartment has proceeded in good faith (as set forth in Section 2.15). Within 45  days of \nreceipt of the Department's report, the Co-Neutrals shall endorse or reject the Baselines and \n8 \n\nthe Target Outcomes on an individual basis. The Co-Neutrals may retain at their discretion \nan  expert to  help  the  Co-Neutrals  determine the  validity  of the  Department's  proposed \nBaselines and Target Outcomes and ongoing data production. For any Baseline or Target \nOutcome, the parties shall have 15 days to submit comments, briefing, or argument to the \nCo-Neutrals.  Thereafter, but in no  event later than 90  days,  the  Co-Neutrals shall  issue \nrevised Baselines and Target Outcomes, which shall not be subject to further review by any \nparty but may, at the discretion of the Co-Neutrals (after providing the parties an opportunity \nto  comment),  be  revised by the  Co-Neutrals.  The Baselines  and  Target  Outcomes  shall \nbecome an amendment to the Plan. \n(g) If the Co-Neutrals reject the Plan, then the Department shall, under the guidance of the \nCo-Neutrals, and in consultation with the legislative and gubernatorial representatives, have \nan additional 30 days to modify the Plan, at which time the Plan may be resubmitted to the \nCo-Neutrals and plaintiffs. If the revised Plan is endorsed, then the Department shall proceed \nas  set forth in Section 2.9(f).  If the Plan is rejected a second time, the Co-Neutrals may \ndesignate a third party not affiliated with plaintiffs to modify the Plan or create a new plan, or \nthe Co-Neutrals, in their sole discretion, may do so themselves. The Department shall fully \ncooperate with any  third party  designated by the  Co-Neutrals  and with the  Co-Neutrals \nduring this process. No later than 75  days after the second rejection, the Co-Neutrals will \nprovide the Plan to all parties, who shall have  15  days to provide comments, briefing, or \nargument to the Co-Neutrals for the purpose of seeking changes to the Plan. Within 15 days \nthereafter,  the  Co-Neutrals  shall  issue  the  Plan,  which  shall  not  be  subject to  further \namendment by any party. The Department shall then proceed as set forth in Section 2.10(f) \nand all subsequent deadlines contained in this Agreement shall be extended by 180 days. \n(h) If the Department believes that the Plan cannot be implemented without appropriations to \nthe Department in excess of existing funding to the Department by the State of Oklahoma, \nthe Department, pursuant to Section 200 of Title 51 of the Oklahoma Statutes, shall seek to \nobtain the approval of the Oklahoma Legislature or the Contingency Review Board of any \nsuch required appropriations. The Attorney General shall provide advice and guidance to the \nContingency Review Board and the Legislature in their review of the Department's request \nfor funds necessary to implement the Plan. Request by the Department to the Legislature or \nthe Contingency Review Board of any additional funding to implement the Plan shall be \nconsidered by the Co-Neutrals in determining a finding of good faith efforts in implementing \nthe Plan by the Department pursuant to Section 2.15 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any \nsuch request for appropriations, the Department shall proceed to implement the provisions of \nthe Plan in good faith, subject to the foregoing provisions. \n(i)  On the date that the Baselines and Target Outcomes are accepted or determined by the \nCo-Neutrals (the \"Acceptance Date\"), the Department shall proceed to implement the Plan \nand shall issue reports to the Co-Neutrals and Class Plaintiffs measuring the Department's \nprogress toward achieving the Target Outcomes.  The reports  shall be submitted monthly \nbeginning with the third month after the Acceptance Date, shall be issued on or before the \n20th day of each month (or the first business day thereafter) for the prior month, and shall \nmeasure progress on a monthly basis (e.g., if the Acceptance Date is June 7, then the first \nreport shall be for September and shall be issued by October 20). Although the reports will \nbe issued pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement, the data in the reports shall be \nincorporated into routine public reporting by the Department and shall continue after the \nconditions  of this  Settlement Agreement are  met.  The  Co-Neutrals  shall issue  a finding \n9 \n\nwithin 60 days of having received the first report stating whether or not the report provides \nsufficient information to measure accurately the Department's progress toward the Target \nOutcomes.  The  Co-Neutrals  may  revise  this  finding  from  time  to  time  as  they  deem \nappropriate for subsequent reports. If the Co-Neutrals find that a report does not provide \nsufficient information to measure accurately the Department's progress, then the Department \nshall revise the report as required by the Co-Neutrals until the report meets this requirement. \nTwice  annually,  the  Co-Neutrals  shall  provide  commentary  regarding  the  Department's \noverall progress as reflected by the reports and shall provide commentary as to whether the \nDepartment  is  making  good  faith  efforts  pursuant  to  Section  2.15  of the  Settlement \nAgreement. The Co-Neutrals may, in their discretion: confirm independently the data and \nstatistics in the reports and/or require additional data as they deem necessary to demonstrate \nperformance  pursuant  to  this  Settlement Agreement;  and  conduct  such record  reviews, \nquantitative  or  qualitative  analysis  as  the  Co-Neutrals  deem  necessary  to  determine the \nDepartment's compliance with this Settlement Agreement.  The reports, commentary, and \nfindings described in this paragraph shall not be subject to appeal but may be included in the \nrecord on appeal as provided in Section 2.15(b). \n2.11  Co-Neutral  Access  to  Department.  Without  limiting  any  other  provision  of the \nSettlement Agreement, the Co-Neutrals,  and their designates,  shall have free  and unfettered \naccess to the Department's staff and documents in order to perform their duties and in order to \nexercise the powers conferred herein. The Department shall cooperate fully and comply with any \nrequest made by the Co-Neutrals. \n2.12  Target Outcome Findings. On or before October 15, 2014, the Co-Neutrals shall issue \nwritten findings to Settling Defendant and Class Counsel identifying for the period through June \n30, 2014, in the Co-Neutrals sole discretion: those Target Outcomes that have been met; those \nTarget Outcomes for which the Department has achieved sustained, positive trending toward the \nTarget Outcomes;  and  those  Target Outcomes  for  which the  Department has  not achieved \nsustained, positive trending (collectively, the \"Target Outcome Findings\"). These findings are \nnot subject to  review.  A second Target Outcome Findings report shall be issued to  Settling \nDefendant and Class Counsel on or before October 15, 2015, for the period through June 30, \n2015.  The  Target  Outcome  Findings  shall  replace  one  of the  Co-Neutrals'  twice  annual \ncommentaries as referenced in Section 2.10(h). \n2.13  Continued Reporting. Even if the Department meets one or more Target Outcomes or \nachieves sustained, positive trending toward one or more Target Outcomes during the term of \nthis Settlement Agreement, the Department will continue to report to the Co-Neutrals on all of \nthe Performance Areas in this Settlement Agreement. \n2.14  Diagnostic and Remedial Activities. If the Department fails to achieve positive trending \nor begins to trend negatively in any area, the Co-Neutrals can at any time require the Department \nto undertake and maintain diagnostic and remedial activities in that performance area. \n2.15  Final Report. (a) On December 15,2016, the Co-Neutrals shall issue a final report. The \nfinal report, in addition to the information contained in the Target Outcome Findings referenced \nabove, shall include a finding that the Department has, or has not, made good faith efforts to \n10 \n\nachieve substantial and sustained progress toward each Target Outcome. If the Co-Neutrals find \nthat the Department has made, for a continuous period of at least two years prior to December \n15, 2016, good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward each Target \nOutcome, then the Department's obligations under this Settlement Agreement shall terminate \nand the parties shall jointly seek to vacate any Judgment entered by the Court as a result of a \nfinding or decision by the Co-Neutrals. If the Co-Neutrals find that the Department has not made \ngood faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward each Target Outcome, the \nDepartment shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Settlement Agreement for successive \none year periods, with a continuation of the identified reporting requirements. At the end of each \nsuch period, the Co-Neutrals shall issue additional Target Outcome Findings until such time as \nthe Co-Neutrals find that the Department has made, for a continuous period of at least two years \nprior to the report, good faith efforts to achieve substantial and sustained progress toward each \nTarget Outcome. \n(b) The parties agree each has a right to appeal to the Court the Final Report of the Co-neutrals \nissued on December 15, 2016.  The parties agree that if Magistrate Judge Wilson is still serving \nas a magistrate for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, or is \nstill serving as a member of the federal judiciary, he shall hear any appeal of the Final Report so \nlong as doing so  does not violate any federal rule or statute.  The parties hereby consent to \ndisposition by Magistrate Judge Wilson in accordance with Title 18, Section 636(c)(1) of the \nUnited States Code for this purpose. If Magistrate Judge Wilson is unable to hear the appeal, \nthen the appeal shall be to the District Court.  A notice of appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) \ndays of the date the Final Report.  The standard of review for any such appeal of the Final \nReport shall be the standard of \"arbitrary and capricious.\"  After a notice of appeal is filed, the \nparties will request a schedule from the court regarding completion of the record and submission \nof briefs. The record for the appeal shall be limited to this Settlement Agreement, the Child \nWelfare  Plan  and  any  amendments  or  appendices  attached  thereto,  Co-neutrals'  reports \n(including but not limited to their written commentary and findings) and the documents relied \nupon by the Co-neutrals to make those reports, and the reports/written responses from the parties \nto  the  Co-neutrals  and  documents  relied upon by the  parties to  make those reports/written \nresponses which were provided to the Co-neutrals for their consideration.  This right to appeal is \nconsidered a final  appeal limited to Magistrate Judge Wilson or, if he is unable to hear the \nappeal, to the District Court, and the decision of either will be final and unappealable to the \nDistrict Court, Tenth Circuit or other court of any jurisdiction. It is agreed by the parties that in \nthe event an appeal is filed, but is unsuccessful, the non-appealing party shall be entitled to \nrecover the reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in defending an unsuccesful appeal. \nCOURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT \nAND CONTINUING JURISDICTION OF THE COURT \n3.1  As  soon  as  practicable  after  the  execution  of  this  Settlement  Agreement,  Class \nRepresentatives and Class Counsel will file a motion seeking: (a) preliminary approval of this \nSettlement Agreement; and (b) authority for the Department to provide notice of the proposed \nsettlement to the Plaintiff Class. Class Counsel will also file a motion for Class Counsel Fees and \nExpenses. \n11 \n\n3.2  After notice of:  (a) the proposed settlement; and (b) Class Counsels' request for Class \nCounsel Fees and Expenses, the Court shall be requested to enter Judgment, substantially in the \nform attached hereto as Exhibit C, approving the settlement between Settling Defendant and the \nPlaintiff  Class,  and  specifically  approving  the  terms  of this  Settlement  Agreement.  The \nJudgment shall: \na.  Approve the settlement between Settling Defendant and the Settlement \nClass embodied in this Settlement Agreement, without modification of its terms \nin any respect, unless all Parties agree to such modifications, as fair, reasonable \nand adequate to the Plaintiff Class within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23; \nb.  Dismiss with prejudice the Class Action Litigation; \nc.  Adjudge that each Settlement Class Member shall be deemed conclusively \nto have released the Released Claims against the Released Parties; \nd.

Include a finding that the settlement between Settling Defendant and the \nSettlement  Class  is  fair,  reasonable  and  was  entered  into  between  Settling \nDefendant and the Settlement Class in good faith and without collusion; \nf.  Include a finding that, by agreeing to settle the Class Action Litigation, \nSettling Defendant does not admit, and specifically denies, any and all liability to \nthe Plaintiff Class, the Class Representatives and Class Counsel; and \ng.  Incorporate the Settlement Agreement and provide that the Court \nretains jurisdiction as set forth herein. \nFAILURE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n4.1  If the Court does  not enter an order preliminarily approving this  settlement, without \nmodification of its terms in any respect, unless all parties agree to such modifications, or does \nnot enter a Judgment approving the settlement (including, without limitation, the provisions of \nParagraph 3 .2  above) between Settling Defendant and the Settlement Class after appropriate \nnotice  of the  Settlement Fairness  Hearing,  in  conformity  herewith,  or  if the  Court  enters \nJudgment approving the settlement between Settling Defendant and the Settlement Class and \nappellate review of said Judgment is sought and upon such review such Judgment is reversed, in \nwhole or in part, then this Settlement Agreement between Settling Defendant and the Settlement \nClass shall immediately become null and void ab initio. It is specifically agreed that any failure \nof the Court to approve the Motion for Class Counsel Fees and Expenses in the amounts sought \nby Class Counsel shall not affect the validity of this Settlement Agreement. \nMISCELLANEOUS \n12 \n\n5.1  Settling Defendant contends that all claims and allegations, individually and collectively, \nof the Class Representatives and the Plaintiff Class in the Class Action Litigation are without \nmerit. Settling Defendant expressly denies all allegations of wrongdoing or liability with respect \nto the claims and allegations. It is expressly agreed that neither this Settlement Agreement nor \nany document referred to herein, nor any action taken to carry out this Settlement Agreement is, \nmay be construed as,  or may be used as  an  admission by Settling Defendant of any  fault, \nwrongdoing or liability whatsoever with respect to the claims and allegations in the Class Action \nLitigation. By agreeing to settle the claims of the Plaintiff Class in the Class Action Litigation, \nSettling Defendant does not admit that the Class Action Litigation is properly maintained as a \nclass action and the Plaintiff Class does not admit any deficiency in the merits of its claims. \n5.2  The Class Representatives, the Settlement Class and Settling Defendant agree to settle the \nclaims of the Plaintiff Class asserted against Settling Defendant in the Class Action Litigation \nand  to  execute  this  Settlement  Agreement  solely  to  compromise  and  settle  protracted, \ncomplicated and expensive litigation.

Before the Court is\n17 plaintiffs' Motion For Class Certification found at document\n18 number 4 in the Court's docket. The Court having reviewed the\n19 pleadings of the parties and having heard argument of counsel\n20 finds as follows:\n21 The named plaintiffs in this case are eight children\n22 in foster care in Oklahoma. They have sued the nine members of\n23 the Oklahoma Commission for Human Services - the body\n24 responsible for formulating the policies and adopting the rules\n25 and regulations for the administration of the Oklahoma\n\n3\n1 Department of Human Services - and the director of DHS himself\n2 in their official capacities. Plaintiffs allege policies and\n3 practices of DHS regarding the state's foster care program\n4 violate their 14th Amendment right to substantive due process,\n5 their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to procedural due\n6 process, and liberty and privacy interests protected by the\n7 First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n8 Plaintiffs seeks certification of the following class:\n9 All children who are or will be in the legal custody\n10 of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, number one, due\n11 to a report or suspicion of abuse or neglect, or two, who are\n12 or will be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.\n13 Plaintiffs in their Statement of Relief Sought found\n14 at document number 241 seek seven remedies summarized as follows:\n15 Number one, caseloads: Limits on the caseloads of all\n16 case carrying workers and supervisors based on standards for\n17 accreditation of public child welfare agencies set by the\n18 Council on Accreditation, the COA, and professional standards\n19 set by the Child Welfare League of America, the CWLA. The CWLA\n20 standards call for a caseload size for family foster care\n21 social workers of between 12 to 15 children per worker, and for\n22 supervisors to supervise no more than five social workers. The\n23 COA recommends that caseloads generally not exceed 18 children\n24 or eight children with special therapeutic needs.\n25 Number two, education and training: The imposition of\n\n4\n1 educational qualifications requirements for caseworkers and\n2 supervisors and implementation of comprehensive pre-service and\n3 in-service training programs for caseworkers, supervisors,\n4 foster parents and adoptive parents based on standards for\n5 training established by the COA and CWLA.\n6 Number three, availability of necessary resources for\n7 placement of children: An assessment by qualified professionals.\n8 to determine, number one, the need for additional placements to\n9 provide the necessary range of placement options for children\n10 in the custody of DHS; number two, the time period during which\n11 these placements will be developed; and number three, the steps\n12 necessary to develop these placements.\n13 Number four, monitoring the safety of children in\n14 placement: Implementation of mandatory schedules for DHS\n15 workers to visit all children in placement and their foster\n16 parents, in accordance with COA standards. Mandatory\n17 compliance with regulations of the Oklahoma Administrative\n18 Code, the OAC, for investigating complaints of abuse and\n19 neglect of children in placement, and mandatory compliance with\n20 OAC standards and processes for the approval, screening,\n21 oversight and utilization of all placement types that house\n22 foster children.\n23 Number five, outcomes for children: An order\n24 requiring DHS shall meet the outcome measures set by the U.S.\n25 Department of Health and Human Services, the DHHS, including,\n\n5\n1 for example, DHHS measures aimed at protecting foster children\n2 from abuse and neglect, ensuring permanency and stability in\n3 their living situations and preserving the continuity of family\n4 relationships and connections.\n5 Number six, quality assurance data: An order\n6 requiring DHS to ensure that it has a quality assurance system\n7 consistent with the standards of the COA and CWLA that is\n8 capable of measuring the quality of treatment and services\n9 provided to children in DHS custody.\n10 And finally, number seven, monitoring and enforcement:\n11 Plaintiffs seek Court appointment of a neutral monitor to\n12 monitor the provisions of any Court order entered pursuant to\n13 Rule 65(d)\n14 Now under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n15 Procedure the Court may certify a class if the purported class\n16 meets four requirements set out in subsection (a) of the rule\n17 and also meets the requirement of one of the types of classes\n18 described in subsection (b) of the rule. The requirements of\n19 Rule 23(a) are numerosity, commonalty of questions of fact or\n20 law between the named plaintiffs and the class, typicality of\n21 named plaintiffs' claims and defenses to those of the class,\n22 and adequacy of the named plaintiffs and their attorneys as\n23 class representatives. The particular type of class plaintiffs\n24 seek to certify is set forth in Rule 23(b)(2), that is,\n25 plaintiffs assert that defendants have acted or refused to act\n\n6\n1 on grounds that apply generally to the class so that final\n2 injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is\n3 appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\n4 Plaintiffs, as the parties seeking certification, bear\n5 a strict burden of proving all the requirements of Rule 23(a)\n6 have been met. Rex v. Owens ex rel, Oklahoma 585 F.2d 432 at\n7 435, Tenth Circuit 1978.\n8 The Court, in its analysis, must accept the\n9 substantive allegations of complaint as true. Shook vs. El\n10 Paso County, 386 F.3d 963 at page 968, Tenth Circuit 2004.\n11 Whether a case should be allowed to proceed as a class\n12 action involves intensely practical considerations, most of\n13 which are purely factual or fact intensive. Reed vs. Brown,\n14 849 F.2d 1307 at 1309, Tenth Circuit 1988.\n15 Each case must be decided on its own facts on the\n16 basis of practicalities and prudential considerations. Reed\n17 vs. Brown again.\n18 The class determination generally involves\n19 considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal\n20 issues comprising the plaintiffs' cause of action. General\n21 Telephone Company of the Southwest vs. Falcon, 457 U.S. at 147\n22 at page 160, 1982.\n23 Therefore, while the Court is not to decide the case\n24 on its merits, it should make whatever factual and legal\n25 inquiries are necessary under Rule 23. Castano vs. American\n\n7\n1 Tobacco Company, 84 F.3d 734 at 744, Fifth Circuit 1996, and\n2 Sazbo, S-A-Z-B-O vs. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., 249 F.3d, 672\n3 at page 676, Seventh Circuit, 2001.\n4 Further to the point, the Court stresses that its\n5 decision today is in no way to be construed as a decision on\n6 the merits. In keeping with the law cited above the Court has\n7 made factual inquiries only to the extent necessary to comply\n8 with the Rule 23 requirements for class certification. A\n9 decision on the merits of plaintiffs' claims lies somewhere\n10 down the road after discovery, motion practice and trial are\n11 complete.\n12 The Court makes the following findings regarding the\n13 elements of 23(a):\n14 Numerosity: Plaintiffs allege the class of children\n15 in foster care due to abuse or neglect numbers in excess of\n16 10,000. Defendants do not dispute the size of the class meets\n17 the numerosity requirement. The Court finds, therefore, that\n18 the numerosity element set forth in Rule 23(a)(1) is satisfied.\n19 Commonality: Plaintiffs have asserted that there are\n20 nine questions of fact and five questions of law common to all\n21 of the children in the class. A finding of commonalty requires\n22 only a single issue of fact or law common to the class. J.B.\n23 vs. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280 at page 1288, Tenth Circuit, 1999.\n24 However, mere allegations of systemic failures of an agency\n25 such as DHS will not suffice. J.B. vs. Valdez at pages 1288\n\n8\n1 and 1289. The Tenth Circuit will not allow plaintiffs, quote\n2 \"to broadly conflate a variety of claims to establish\n3 commonalty via an allegation of systemic failures.\" End quote.\n4 Also J.B. vs. Valdez at the same pages.\n5 The class that plaintiffs seek to represent is quite\n6 diverse. It's members range in age from infants to teenagers.\n7 The reasons they end up in the foster care system vary widely.\n8 Their placements range from emergency shelters to institutions,\n9 to group homes, to placement with relatives, to placement with\n10 unrelated foster care providers. Their needs vary widely.\n11 Their lengths of stay in the foster care system are similarly\n12 diverse. The ultimate outcome goals for these children vary.\n13 Reunification with their birth families is the goal for some\n14 while adoption is the goal for others. Their physical,\n15 educational, and emotional needs are divergent. Many are\n16 Native American children and thus special laws apply to them.\n17 Some have been adjudicated not only as deprived, but as\n18 juvenile delinquents.\n19 Suffice it to say, as a result of the diversity of the\n20 group, many of the questions of fact and law plaintiffs allege\n21 to be common do not appear to be, in fact, common. A clear\n22 example of this is the question of whether DHS has a policy or\n23 practice of failing to arrange for and facilitate plaintiffs'\n24 family relationships causing significant harm and risk of harm\n25 to plaintiffs' health and well-being. Clearly, this is not\n\n9\n1 that fact issue common to all children in foster care because\n2 the goal for many children is to terminate parental rights of\n3 the biological family and place these children for adoption.\n4 Similarly, the question whether DHS has a policy or practice of\n5 subjecting plaintiffs to unreasonably frequent moves from\n6 placement to placement causing significant harm and risk of\n7 harm to plaintiffs' health and well-being is not common to all\n8 children because many, perhaps the majority, of children in\n9 foster care are not subjected to frequent moves.\n10 However, the court finds at least one common issue of\n11 fact: Whether DHS has a policy or practice of failing to\n12 adequately monitor the safety of plaintiff children causing\n13 significant harm and risk of harm to plaintiff children's\n14 safety, health and well-being.\n15 With respect to the adequate monitoring of foster\n16 children's safety, the Court finds, based on evidence submitted\n17 by the parties, that this is a fact issue common to all\n18 children in the proposed class. The Court is not making any\n19 finding that these children are all subjected to harm as a\n20 result of DHS's monitoring practices. The Court is simply\n21 finding that the issue of whether the monitoring practices\n22 compromise the safety of foster children is an issue common to\n23 the entire proposed class.\n24 Additionally, it appears to the Court that this common\n25 factual issue also raises at least one common legal issue,\n\n10\n1 specifically whether the alleged policies or practices violate\n2 plaintiffs' right to be reasonably free from harm and imminent\n3 risk of harm while in state custody. See Yvonne L. vs. New\n4 Mexico Department of Human Services, 959 F.2d 883 at page 892\n5 to 893.\n6 Therefore, the Court finds the commonalty element set\n7 forth in Rule 23(a)(2) has been met.\n8 Typicality: Rule 23(a)(3) requires the claims of the\n9 named plaintiffs to be typical of the claims of the class.\n10 Obviously, issues of commonalty and typicality are closely\n11 related, and as with the commonalty requirement, differing fact\n12 situations of class members do not defeat typicality under Rule\n13 23(a)(3) so long as the claims of the class representatives and\n14 class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory.\n15 Adamson vs. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668 at 676, Tenth Circuit 1988.\n16 In a civil rights action such as this one typicality\n17 does not require that the interest and the claims of the named\n18 plaintiffs and the class members to be identical. Anderson vs.\n19 City of Albuquerque, 690 F.2d 796 at page 800, Tenth Circuit,\n20 1982.\n21 As long as the class representatives' claims are not\n22 significantly antagonistic to a class, typicality is established.\n23 In re: Williams Companies ERISA Litigation, Northern District\n24 of Oklahoma 2005.\n25 While each named plaintiff and each potential class\n\n11\n1 member has his or her own unique background, story and\n2 problems, the Court finds that the interests of the named\n3 plaintiffs and the class member are not significantly\n4 antagonistic.\n5 Therefore, the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3)\n6 is satisfied.\n7 Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d): Plaintiffs seek class\n8 certification under Rule 23(b)(2), asserting that DHS has acted\n9 or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,\n10 so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\n11 relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. Rule\n12 23(b), in turn, implicates Rule 65(d) which provides that every\n13 order granting an injunction must state the reasons why it\n14 issued, state its terms specifically, and describe in\n15 reasonable detail, and not by referring to the complaint or\n16 other documents, the act or acts to be restrained or required.\n17 The tension between Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d) was examined\n18 at length by the Tenth Circuit in the Tenth Circuit's recent\n19 Shook II decision found at Shook vs. Board of County\n20 Commissioner of County of El Paso, 543 F. 3d 597, Tenth\n21 Circuit, 2008.\n22 The Tenth Circuit stated in Shook II that Rule\n23 23(b)(2) imposes two separate but related requirements: First,\n24 the defendants' actions or inactions must be based on grounds\n25 generally applicable to all class members. Second, the final\n\n12\n1 injunctive relief must be appropriate for the class as a whole.\n2 The Tenth Circuit said that quote, \"put differently, Rule\n3 23(b)(2) demands a certain cohesiveness amongst class members\n4 with respect no their injuries, the absence of which can\n5 preclude certification.\" End quote. Found at page 604. The\n6 court described the cohesiveness as follows: First, the class\n7 must be sufficiently cohesive that any class-wide injunctive\n8 relief can satisfy the limitations of Rule 65(d), namely the\n9 requirement that it state its terms specifically and describe\n10 in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained or required.\n11 Second, a class action may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2)\n12 if relief specifically tailored to each class member would be\n13 necessary to correct the allegedly wrongful conduct of each\n14 defendant.\n15 The court's ruling in Shook II cautions that\n16 individual issues cannot be avoided simply by formulating an\n17 injunction at a stratospheric level of abstraction, and\n18 injunctions simply requiring defendants to obey the law are too\n19 vague to satisfy Rule 65. The bottom line is that, at the\n20 class certification stage where we are now, the injunctive\n21 relief sought must be described in reasonably particular detail\n22 such that the Court can at least conceive of an injunction that\n23 would satisfy the requirements of both Rule 65(d) and Rule\n24 23(b)(2). Shook II at pages 605 and 606.\n25 Defendants argue that none of plaintiffs' proposed\n\n13\n1 remedies meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d)\n2 because they are too vague, unmanageable and/or inappropriate.\n3 The Court agrees with defendants at least with respect to many\n4 of the proposed remedies. Without ruling definitively the\n5 Court can state that this Court is disinclined to enter an\n6 injunction generally requiring DHS to obey Oklahoma statutes\n7 and regulations because such an order would run afoul of Rule\n8 65 and the Tenth Circuit's directives. The Court will also be\n9 reluctant to order any type of relief incapable of description\n10 in a sufficiently objective way that both the defendant and the\n11 Court can determine whether the defendant is complying.\n12 However, at least one remedy requested by plaintiffs\n13 appears to pass the test set out in Shook II. Plaintiffs seek\n14 an injunction setting limits on the caseloads of caseworkers\n15 and their supervisors. While the Court does not necessarily\n16 accept the propositions that the caseloads should be based on\n17 standards set by the COA and the CWLA, as proposed by\n18 plaintiffs, the injunctive relief is set forth in enough\n19 concrete manageable detail that the Court can at least conceive\n20 of an injunction that would satisfy the requirements of both\n21 Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d). Plaintiffs assert in this\n22 lawsuit that excessive caseloads are harming or putting at risk\n23 of harm all children in the class. Imposition of caseload\n24 limits would apply to the entire class. Thus, Rule 23(b)(2)'s\n25 cohesiveness requirement is met. The Rule 65(d) requirement is\n\n14\n1 also met because an injunction setting caseload limits would\n2 provide sufficient specificity and detail to escape the\n3 vagueness prohibition.\n4 In this vein, the Court would like to address an\n5 argument raised by defendants in their briefing and in argument\n6 today. Defendants take the position that plaintiffs must show\n7 actual injury in order to seek injunctive relief and that a\n8 determination must be made that each and every plaintiff in the\n9 class must show actual injury before they are entitled to an\n10 injunction. In support of these propositions defendants cite\n11 the Vallario vs. Vandehey decision at 545 F.3d 1259, at page\n12 1268 note 7, Tenth Circuit 2009, and Tandy vs. City of Wichita,\n13 380 F.3d 1288 at page 1283, Tenth Circuit 2004. The defendants\n14 are mistaken in two respects. First, under Tandy, in order to\n15 establish standing named plaintiffs must show an injury in fact\n16 that is actual or imminent. However, in Tandy the court said\n17 that if plaintiffs seek prospective relief as opposed to\n18 retrospective relief, the plaintiffs must show they are\n19 suffering a continuing injury or be under a real and immediate\n20 threat of being injured in the future. Further, the court held\n21 in Tandy that quote, \"Past wrongs are evidence bearing on\n22 whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated\n23 injury.\" End quote. Found at 380 F.3d at 1283. Moreover,\n24 while named plaintiffs must show standing in order to proceed,\n25 neither Vallario nor Tandy stand for the proposition that each\n\n15\n1 and every class member must go through the same process at this\n2 point in this case, that is, in order to meet the requirements\n3 for class certification.\n4 Applying this test, six of the remaining eight\n5 plaintiffs C.S., J.B. A.P., J.P., R.J., and G.C. allege\n6 physical abuse, sexual abuse, and/or injury due to unsafe\n7 conditions while in custody of DHS. The remaining two\n8 plaintiffs, J.A. and K.T., do not actually allege physical\n9 injury due to abuse or neglect in DHS custody, although I\n10 believe in Ms. Lowry's argument today she asserted that K.T.\n11 has in fact been subject to physical abuse. J.A., a 5-year old\n12 boy, alleges that during the one year he had been in custody\n13 before this suit was filed he had been shuffled through nine\n14 different placements including institutional facilities, which\n15 has led to a lack of adequate stability, treatment or care.\n16 K.T., a 16 year old girl, alleges she has suffered from\n17 developmental delays from being housed in inappropriate, unsafe\n18 and poorly monitored emergency shelters and group homes.\n19 The Court concludes that the allegations of the\n20 remaining named plaintiffs satisfy the requirement regarding\n21 injury in fact and imminent risk of injury and, therefore, the\n22 Court must reject defendants' standing argument.\n23 The question remains, given the Court's determination\n24 as to allegation of shuffled placement doesn't meet the\n25 commonalty requirement, whether J.A. should remain a member of\n\n16\n1 the class, but I'll leave that to you to suggest how to\n2 proceed. And of course we're proceeding with discovery so I\n3 don't know that it precludes discovery on the issue, but that\n4 remains an issue to be wrestled with.\n5 Examining the remedies proposed by plaintiffs, it is\n6 clear that at least the caseload limit remedy meets the\n7 requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d), that is, it\n8 applies to the proposed class in a cohesive manner which would\n9 not require the Court to look at each class member individually,\n10 and at the same time it is specific and detailed enough that it\n11 escapes the vagueness defect. In this case, in contrast to the\n12 facts presented in Shook II, plaintiffs have given content to\n13 what it would mean to provided adequate caseload staffing.\n14 Thus, for purposes of today's hearing, plaintiffs have\n15 satisfied Rule 65(d) by showing that caseload limits are\n16 ultimately capable of description in a sufficiently objective\n17 way that both the defendants and the Court can determine if the\n18 defendants are complying.\n19 Similarly, while this Court would be disinclined to\n20 order DHS to quote, \"obey the law,\" end quote, regarding\n21 visitation and monitoring of foster children by caseworkers,\n22 the Court can conceive of an injunction regarding visitation\n23 and monitoring, if warranted by the evidence in a trial on the\n24 merits, that would meet the cohesiveness mandate of Rule\n25 23(b)(2) and still be specific enough to satisfy Rule 65(d).\n\n17\n1 The Court is less convinced that the remaining\n2 requests for relief meet the requirements of Rule 23 and Rule\n3 65. However, the Court makes no conclusive rulings about\n4 remedies today other than that with respect to plaintiffs'\n5 class certification motion, the remedy dealing with caseload\n6 limits and the remedy dealing with monitoring of children in\n7 foster care, appear to meet the requirements of these two\n8 rules. Therefore, this Court concludes that certification of\n9 the class requested by plaintiffs is appropriate.\n10 For these reasons, plaintiffs' motion to certify,\n11 document number 4, is granted and the Court hereby certifies\n12 under Rule 23 the following class:\n13 All children who are or will be in the legal custody\n14 of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (1) due to a\n15 report or suspicion of abuse or neglect, or (2) who are or will\n16 be adjudicated deprived due to abuse or neglect.\n17 Counsel, if you-all would approach.\n18 (Off-the-record sidebar conference out of hearing of\n19 open court and the court reporter.)\n20 THE COURT: Ms. Lowry, with regard to exhibits?\n21 MS. LOWRY: Yes. Your Honor, I neglected to ask the\n22 Court to receive the dispositives that I used during the\n23 argument and so I would ask that they be made a part of the\n24 record.\n25 THE COURT: Very well. And how are those marked?\n\n18\n1 MS. LOWRY: They are numbered 1 through 11.\n2 THE COURT: Very well. Any objection?\n3 MR. NANCE: No, Your Honor.\n4 THE COURT: Very well, Plaintiff's 1 through 11 are\n5 admitted.\n6 In addition, the Court needs to make the following\n7 conclusion with regard to Rule 23(a)(4), and I apologize for\n8 reading the order, but it's necessary to satisfy the legal\n9 requirements that are set forth by the Tenth Circuit, and\n10 there's one additional matter that the Court needs to touch\n11 upon. Rule 23(a)(4) requires a two-part inquiry. Number one,\n12 do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of\n13 interest with other class members; and number two, will the\n14 named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action\n15 vigorously on behalf of the class? See Rutter & Wilbanks\n16 Corporation vs. Shell Oil Company, 314 F.3d 1180, at pages 1187\n17 to 1188, Tenth Circuit, 2002. In this case there appears to be\n18 no dispute regarding those two matters regarding counsel, as to\n19 conflict of interest or their ability to prosecute the action\n20 vigorously. Is there anything further?\n21 MS. LOWRY: Not from plaintiffs, Your Honor.\n22 THE COURT: Mr. Nance.\n23 MR. NANCE: No, Your Honor. You are entering a\n24 written order in keeping with what you said or is this the\n25 ruling?\n\n19\n1 THE COURT: Well, this would be the ruling. The\n2 question may arise whether or not we ought to simply rewrite\n3 what I just read. You can certainly get it from Glen here.\n4 Basically it would not differ whatsoever from what I just read,\n5 so I think it's been adequately set forth on the record. There\n6 may be some debate about that but...\n7 MR. NANCE: Thank you, Your Honor. And nothing\n8 further from us.\n9 THE COURT: Very well. If there's nothing further\n10 we'll be adjourned.\n11 (Recess.)\n12\n13 A TRUE AND CORRECT TRANSCRIPT.\n14\n15 CERTIFIED: s/ Glen R. Dorrough\nGlen R.

BRAD HENRY, in his official capacity as  )\nGovernor of the State of Oklahoma, et al., )\n )\n                           Defendants. )\nO P I N I O N  A N D  O R D E R\nThis matter comes before the court on defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject\nMatter Jurisdiction. [Doc. No. 77].   On January 7, 2009, the court denied the motion with\nrespect to all causes of action except plaintiffs’ third and fifth causes of action.  The court took\nthe motion under advisement with respect to these causes of action.  For the reasons set forth\nbelow, defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction is granted with\nrespect to plaintiffs’ third and fifth causes of action.\nPlaintiffs’ third cause of action is a Section 1983 claim arising from alleged violations of\nthe federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. §621 et\nseq.  Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action is a common law claim for breach of alleged third party\nbeneficiary rights arising from the AACWA.\n    Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of Action–Violations of AACWA\nIn their third cause of action, plaintiffs allege the policies and practices of the defendants\nhave deprived them of rights conferred by  AACWA and regulations promulgated thereunder. \nSpecifically, they allege:\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 2 of 13\n1.  Plaintiffs are entitled to timely written case plans containing mandated elements and\nto a case review system to ensure implementation of those plans. [citing  42 U.S.C.\n§§622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 671(a)(16); 675(1) and 675(5)(A)].  \n2.  Plaintiffs have a right to have a petition to terminate parental rights filed or have\ncompelling reasons document why such petition has not been filed, in accordance with specified\nstatutory standards and time frames. [citing 42 U.S.C. §§622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 671(a)(16); 675(5)(E);\n675 note; and 45 C.F.R. §1356.21(i)].  \n3.  Plaintiff children whose permanency goal is adoption have an enforceable right to\nplanning and services to obtain a permanent placement including documentation of steps taken\nto secure permanency. [citing 42 U.S.C. §§622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 622(b)(8)(A)(iii)(II); 671(a)(16);\n675(1)(E); 675(5)].\n4.  Plaintiff children have an enforceable right to services that protect their safety and\nhealth. [citing 42 U.S.C. §§622(b)(15); 671(a)(22); 675(1)(B); 45 C.F.R. §1357.10(c)(5)].\n5.  Plaintiff children have an enforceable right to have health and educational records\nreviewed, updated and supplied to foster parents or foster care providers with whom they are\nplaced, at the time of the placement. [citing 42 U.S.C. §§622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 671(a)(16); 675(1)(C);\n675(5)(D)].\n6.  Plaintiff children have an enforceable right to live in foster placements that have the\ncapacity to provide for their essential needs and services by receiving adequate foster care\nmaintenance payments that cover the actual cost of (and the cost of providing) plaintiff\nchildren’s food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies, reasonable travel to\nvisitation with family and other expenses. [citing 42 U.S.C. §§671(a)(1), 671(a)(11), 671(a)(22),\n672(a)-(c); 675(4)(A) and 45 C.F.R. §§1355.20(a), 1356.21(m)(1)].\nA.  Requirements for Finding a Statute Creates a\n         Private Cause of Action\nSection 1983 imposes liability upon anyone who, under color of state law, deprives a\nperson “of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”  To seek\nredress through Section 1983, a plaintiff must assert a violation of a federal right, not merely a\nviolation of federal law.  Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997).  In Blessing, the\nSupreme Court set forth three criteria necessary to finding that a statutory provision gives rise to\na federal right: (1) Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the\n2\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 3 of 13\nplaintiff; (2) the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not\nso “vague and amorphous” that its enforcement would strain judicial competence; and (3) the\nstatute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States.  Id. at 340-41.  See also,\nMandy R. v. Owens, 464 F.3d 1139, 1146-47 (10th Cir. 2006).  \nIn Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283-84 (2002), the Supreme Court\ntightened the first requirement, holding that an enforceable private right exists only if the statute\ncontains nothing “short of an unambiguously conferred right” and not merely a vague benefit or\ninterest.   The court in Gonzaga emphasized that in cases brought to enforce legislation enacted\npursuant to the spending power of Congress, Congress must “speak with a clear voice” and\nmanifest an “unambiguous” intent to confer individual rights before federal funding provisions\nwill be read to provide a basis for private enforcement.  Id. at 280.  “In legislation enacted\npursuant to the spending power, the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally\nimposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the\nFederal Government to terminate funds to the State.”  Id., citing Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.\nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981).  \nThe court in Gonzaga held that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974\n(FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, did not create a private right of action under §1983.  In FERPA,\nCongress explicitly directed the Secretary of Education to withhold federal funding from states\nwith a policy or practice of permitting the unauthorized release of education records or personal\ninformation.  20 U.S.C. §1232g(b)(1).  536 U.S. at 287.  The court contrasted this with the\nlanguage of Titles VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“no person...shall...be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal Financial Assistance”) and Title\n3\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 4 of 13\nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“No person...shall, on the basis of sex, ... be\nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance”), both of which create enforceable private rights.  Id. at 284, n. 3.  “Unlike the\nindividually focused terminology of Titles VI and IX...FERPA’s provision speak only to the\nSecretary of Education...This focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students\nand parents and clearly does not confer the sort of “individual entitlement” that is enforceable\nunder §1983.”  Id. (citations omitted). \nThe court in Gonzaga also noted that FERPA’s nondisclosure provisions “speak only in\nterms of institutional policy and practice, not individual instances of disclosure...they have an\n“aggregate” focus...they are not concerned with whether the needs of any particular person have\nbeen satisfied, and they cannot give rise to individual rights.”  Id. at 288 (citations omitted). \nFinally, the court held that the mechanism Congress chose to provide for enforcing those\nprovisions buttressed its conclusion that FERPA’s nondisclosure provisions fail to confer a\nprivate right of action: “Congress expressly authorized the Secretary of Education to ‘deal with\nviolations’ of the Act...and required the Secretary to ‘establish or designate [a] review board’ for\ninvestigating and adjudicating such violations.”  Id. at 289. \nAfter Gonzaga, the Tenth Circuit has applied the more stringent test to determine that the\n“sufficient payments” section of the Medicaid Act [42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(30)(A)] does not create\nan enforceable private right of action,  Mandy R., 464 F.2d at 1147, and that a federal statute\nlimiting illegal aliens’ eligibility for higher education benefits [8 U.S.C. §1623] does not create a\nprivate right of action.  Day v. Bond, 500 F.3d 1127, 1139 (10th Cir. 2007).\nPost-Gonzaga, the Tenth Circuit has not addressed whether any provisions of the\n4\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 5 of 13\nAACWA create a private right of action.1  However, in 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d\n1255 (11th Cir. 2003), the Eleventh Circuit found that §§675(5)(D) and (E) of the AACWA–two\nof the provisions plaintiffs in this case rely upon–do not confer a private right of action\nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. §1983.  The court noted that the AACWA–like FERPA in the\nGonzaga case–is a federal funding statute.  Id. at 1270.  For a state to receive funds, it must\nsatisfy certain requirements, including submission of a State Plan for foster care and adoption\nassistance.  Id. citing 42 U.S.C. §671(a).   If a state follows its approved plan, it receives federal\nfunds. Id. citing 42 U.S.C. §670; 42 U.S.C. §1320a-2a.  If a state fails to follow its approved\nplan, it may lose all or some of the federal funds it otherwise would receive.  Id.  The Secretary\nis required to promulgate regulations for use in reviewing state programs in order to determine\nwhether they are in substantial conformity with the state plan.  Id.  The regulation must require\nthe Secretary to withhold federal funds if a state has failed to substantially conform to its\napproved plan, and the regulations do exactly that.  Id., citing 42 U.S.C. §1320a-2a(b)(3), 45\nC.F.R. §§1355.35(c)(4), 1355.36(b).   \nCiting Gonzaga, the court in 31 Foster Children pointed out that §675(5)(D) and (E) are\ndefinitional in nature and there cannot, alone, supply a basis for conferring rights enforceable\nunder §1983.  Id. at 1271.  The court noted that other than the definition of “case review\nsystem,” the only provision in Part E of Title IV that uses the term is 42 U.S.C.\n1Pre-Gonzaga, , in Yvonne L. v. New Mexico Department of Human Services, 959 F.2d\n883, 889 (10th Cir. 1992), the Tenth Circuit held “that individual causes of action [under\nAACWA] may be appropriate, depending upon the particular section or violation involved.” \nHowever, the court concluded plaintiffs’ contentions that defendants had failed to comply with\n42 U.S.C. §671(a)(1) and the alleged facts supporting those contentions were insufficient to\ndefeat summary judgment on their claim.  Id.  \n5\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 6 of 13\n§671(a)(16)–another provision relied upon by plaintiffs in this case.  That section conditions\nreceipt of federal funds on implementation of a State Plan that, among other things, provides for\n“a case review system which meets the requirements of section 675(5)(B)...with respect to each\nsuch child.”  However,  the court pointed out, §671(a)(16) does not condition receipt of federal\nfunds on compliance with either §675(5)(D) or (E).  “The conclusion we reach is that Congress\nknew how to require compliance with all aspects of a case review system, as described in\n§676(5), when it wanted to do so.  It did not choose to do so in §671(a)(16).”  Id. at 1271-72.\nThe court in 31 Foster Children also concluded §§675(5)(D) and (E) “do not have the\nkind of focused-on-the individual, rights-creating language required by Gonzaga.  Instead, the\nlanguage of those provisions gives them an aggregate or system wide focus instead of one that\nindicates concern with whether the needs of any particular child are met.”  Id. at 1272.  \nB.  Analysis\nAs noted by the court in 31 Foster Children, the AACWA, 42 U.S.C. §§621 et seq., is a\nfederal funding statute that establishes a program of payments to states for foster care and\nadoption assistance.  The typical remedy for state noncompliance with such a statute is not a\nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the federal government to\nterminate funds to the state.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280.  The AACWA, in fact, directs the\nSecretary to promulgate regulations for the review of state operations to determine whether they\nare in “substantial conformity” with State Plans and to withhold federal funds if they are not.  42\nU.S.C. §1320a-2a.  Therefore, as instructed in Gonzaga,  Congress must “speak with a clear\nvoice” and manifest an “unambiguous” intent to confer individual rights before federal funding\nprovisions will be read to provide a basis for private enforcement.  536 U.S. at 280. \n6\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 7 of 13\nPlaintiffs urge the court to conclude, based on repeated us of the words “child” and\n“children,” that the AACWA creates a private right of action for foster children.  However,\napplying the inquiry mandated by Gonzaga, the court must conclude otherwise.  The court has\nreviewed every provision of the AACWA relied upon by plaintiffs.2  None convince the court\nthat Congress has “with a clear voice” manifested an unambiguous intent to confer individual\nrights.  Certainly the provisions are unlike Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or Title IX of\nthe Education Amendments of 1972.  Rather, the provisions of the AACWA impose on states\nrequirements that are institutional and aggregate in nature.3   \n1.  Right to Timely Written Case Plans Containing Mandated Elements and to a\nCase Review System to Ensure Implementation of those Plans. \nThe AACWA requires State Plans to include a case review system for the review of each\nfoster child [42 U.S.C. §622(b)(8)(A) (ii)] that meets specific requirements [42 U.S.C.\n§675(5)(A)] and to provide for development of a case plan for each child [42 U.S.C.\n§671(a)(16)] which contains specific required elements [42 U.S.C. §675(1)].  Plaintiffs argue\nthese statutes therefore confer a privately enforceable right to timely written case plans\ncontaining mandated elements.  However, a review of these statutes fails to convince the court\nthat Congress has “with a clear voice” manifested an unambiguous intent to confer individual\n2Plaintiffs also rely upon regulations enacted pursuant to the AACWA.  The\nregulations–being outside the scope of the text of the statutes themselves–do not aid the court in\ndetermining whether Congress intended, in passing the legislation, to confer a private right of\naction.  Nevertheless, the court has reviewed the regulations and finds that they contain no\n“rights creating” language required by Gonzaga.\n3Plaintiffs rely on 42 U.S.C. §675 and/or its subsections for every right asserted under\nAACWA.  As noted by the court in 31 Foster Children, §675 is definitional in nature and\ntherefore cannot supply a basis for conferring rights under §1983.  329 F.3d at 1271 (citing\nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 and Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F.Supp.2d 476, 490 (D.N.J. 2000).\n7\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 8 of 13\nrights.  Certainly, none of these provisions are like Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Rather, these provisions impose upon states the\nrequirement to adopt State Plans that have specific elements.  Thus, the court believes these\nprovisions are institutional and aggregate in nature.\n2.  Right to Have a Petition to Terminate Parental Rights Filed or Have Compelling\nReasons Document Why Such Petition has not been Filed, in Accordance with\nSpecified Statutory Standards and Time Frames\nThe case review systems of the State Plans [42 U.S.C. §622(b)(8)(A)(ii)] must have a\nprocedure assuring that, in the case of a child who has been in foster care for 15 of the most\nrecent 22 months or has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an abandoned\ninfant, or whose parent has committed murder or voluntary manslaughter of  or felony assault\nupon another child of the parent, or the other parent, the state will file a petition to terminate the\nparental rights of the child’s parents and concurrently to identify, process, and approve a\nqualified family for an adoption or document reasons why the filing of a petition would be in the\nbest interest of the child.   [42 U.S.C. §675(5)(E)].  The procedure for determining when a\npetition to terminate parental rights must be filed is set forth in 5 C.F.R. §1356.21(i).  \nSection 675(5)(E), much like §§675(1) and 675(5)(A), does not manifest an unambiguous\nintent to confer individual rights.  Rather, it is part of a listing of specific elements the State\nPlans are required to cover.  The court finds that AACWA does not create an individual right to\nsue under §1983 for a state’s failure to comply with this provision.\n3.  Right of Plaintiff Children Whose Permanency Goal is Adoption to Planning and\nServices to Obtain Permanent Placement\nThe AACWA requires State Plans to provide for a service program designed to help\n8\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 9 of 13\nchildren  either to be returned to families from which they have been removed, where safe and\nappropriate, or placed for adoption, with a legal guardian or other permanent living arrangement.\n[42 U.S.C. §§622(b)(8)(A)(iii)(I) and (II)].  A case plan must be developed for each child. [42\nU.S.C. §§671(a)(16) and 675(5)].  The case plan for children with respect to whom the\npermanency program is determined to be adoption or placement in another permanent home\nmust include documentation of the steps the agency is taking to adopt or place the child. [42\nU.S.C. §675(1)(E)]. \nOnce again, these statutes deal with the requirements of the State Plans.  The State Plans\nmust have a service program which, among other things, helps with adoption or other permanent\nplacement of children, and the case plans have to document efforts to achieve this goal. \nHowever, there is no language that manifests unambiguous intent to confer a private right of\naction.  \n4.  Right to Services that Protect Safety and Health\nThe AACWA requires that State Plans describe how the state “actively consults with and\ninvolves physicians and other appropriate medical professionals” in assessing the health and\nwell-being of foster children and determining appropriate medical treatment for them. [42 U.S.C.\n§622(b)(15)].  The case plan developed for each child [42 U.S.C. §671(a)(22)] must include “a\nplan for assuring that the child receives safe and proper care” and addressing the needs of the\nchild in foster care. [42 U.S.C. §675(1)(B)].  Federal regulations also state that one purpose of\nchild welfare services is to assure adequate care of children away from their homes where the\nchild cannot be returned home or cannot be place for adoption.  45 C.F.R. §1357.10(c)(5).\nThese provisions set out yet another requirement of the State Plans and describe another\n9\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 10 of 13\nrequired element of the case plans for foster children.  There is no clear, unambiguous\nexpression of Congressional intent to confer individual rights.\n5.  Right to Have Health and Education Records Reviewed, Updated and Supplied\nto Foster Parents or Foster Providers\nThe AACWA requires that State Plans have case review systems [42 U.S.C.\n§622(b)(8)(A)(ii)] and case plans for each child [42 U.S.C. §671(a)(16)] that contain the health\nand education records of the child [42 U.S.C. §675(1)(C)] and the case review system must\nassure that the health and education records are supplied to the foster parent or foster care\nprovider at the time of each placement. [42 U.S.C. §675(5)(D)].  \nThis clearly does not confer any private right of action to plaintiff children.4  Rather, it is\nbut another requirement of State Plans.\n6.  Right to Live in Foster Placements That Have the Capacity to Provide for\nEssential Needs and Services by Receiving Adequate Foster Care Maintenance Payments\nThe AACWA requires that State Plans provide for foster care maintenance payments in\naccordance with §672 of the act and for adoption assistance in accordance with §673 of the act\n[42 U.S.C. §671(a)(1)].  The State Plans must provide for periodic review of the amounts paid as\nfoster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance to assure their continuing\nappropriateness. [42 U.S.C. §671(a)(11)].  The State Plans must also provide for granting an\nopportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for benefits\navailable pursuant to the statute is denied or not acted upon with reasonable promptness. [42\n4Section 675(5)(D) also provides that the health and education records are to be supplied\nto the child at the time the child leaves foster care by reason of having reached the age of\nmajority.  This is the only statutory language in the AACWA the court is aware of that  appears\nto confer a direct right to foster children.  Plaintiffs, all of whom are minors, have not asserted\nany such right.\n10\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 11 of 13\nU.S.C. §671(a)(12)].  Section 672 sets out the requirements for states’ foster care maintenance\npayments programs. [42 U.S.C. §672].  The term “foster care maintenance payments” is defined\nto cover the cost of food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies, a child’s personal\nincidentals, liability insurance and reasonable travel to the child’s home for visitation. [42 U.S.C.\n§675(4)(A)].  In the case of institutional care, the term includes the reasonable costs of\nadministration and operation of the institution as are necessarily required to provide these items. \n[Id.].  Definitions of “foster care maintenance payments,” “foster family care,” and “child care\ninstitutions” are set forth in 45 C.F.R. §1355.20(a).  Regulations also require periodic reviews by\nthe states of the appropriateness of foster care maintenance payments. [45 C.F.R.\n§1356.21(m)(1)].\nHowever, nowhere in the provisions cited by plaintiff is there language suggesting a clear\nCongressional intent to confer a private right of action on foster children.  Instead the statutes\nonce again set out the requirements of state plans and state foster care maintenance payment\nprograms.  \nC.  Conclusion Regarding Creation of Private Rights\nPlaintiffs cannot meet the first prong of the analysis set forth in Blessing as modified by\nGonzaga.  None of the statutory provisions of AACWA cited by plaintiffs indicates Congress\nhas spoken clearly to manifest an intent to confer rights on individual plaintiffs under §1983.5 \nMandy, 464 F.3d at 1148.  Therefore, analysis of the remaining two prongs of the private right of\n5The court has also reviewed the following provisions cited by plaintiffs in  ¶246 of their\ncomplaint as supporting their third cause of action, but not cited in plaintiffs’ brief in opposition\nto defendants’ motion to dismiss: 42 U.S.C. §§629a(a)(1)(A)(i)-(ii), 629a(a)(7)-(8); 45 C.F.R.\n§1355.25; 45 C.F.R. §1356.21(f)-(g); 45 C.F.R. §1357.10(c)(4) and (6).  None of these\nprovisions contains language creating individual rights.\n11\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 12 of 13\naction test is unnecessary.\nDefendants are entitled to dismissal of plaintiffs’ third cause of action.\nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Cause of Action–Third Party Beneficiary \n           Rights Under AACWA\nPlaintiffs, in their Fifth Cause of Action, characterize the State Plans between the federal\ngovernment and states as “contracts” and contend that they are third party beneficiaries of the\n“contracts.”  Defendants, in their motion to dismiss, challenge the characterization of the State\nPlans as “contracts,” and deny plaintiffs are third party beneficiaries of the State Plans.\nThe parties dispute whether state common law or federal common law governs the issue\nof third party beneficiary rights, with defendants taking the position that the former controls and\nplaintiffs alleging the latter controls.  The court concludes federal common law should be\napplied because plaintiffs’ claim arises from a federal statute.  See D’Amato v. Wisconsin, 760\nF.2d 1474, 1479 (7th Cir. 1985). \nHowever, whether state common law or federal common law governs, the third party\nbeneficiary issue is inextricably linked with the question of whether the AACWA creates a\nprivate right of action.  In Hodges v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company, 728 F.2d\n414 (10th Cir. 1984), the court considered claims by a discharged railroad employee that the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 conferred a private right of action and that he was a third party\nbeneficiary under act.  The court, after analyzing the language of the statute, concluded no\nprivate right of action was created by it.  Id. at 416.  Having concluded no private right of action\nexisted, the court held that the third party beneficiary claim was “but another aspect of the\nimplied right of action argument,” and denied the claim.  Id.\n12\n\nCase 4:08-cv-00074-GKF-FHM     Document 220  Filed in USDC ND/OK on 01/20/2009     Page 13 of 13\nSimilarly, in this case the viability of the third party beneficiary claim depends on a\nfinding that the AACWA confers upon plaintiffs some private right of action.  The court has\nconcluded it does not.  As in Hodges, the third party beneficiary claim is but another aspect of\nthe implied right of action, and must fall with that claim.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, defendants’ motion to dismiss [Doc. No. 77] is granted in\npart.  Plaintiffs’ third and fifth causes of action are hereby dismissed.  The motion is denied with\nrespect to plaintiffs’ remaining causes of action.\nENTERED this 19th day of January, 2009.\n \n \n13",

Roberts are currently members of the Commission. 2  [Dkt. #2, ¶¶34-40; Dkt. #227, \n                                                 \n2 At the time the lawsuit was filed, Richard L. DeVaughn was Chairman and Ronald C. Mercer \nwas Vice Chairman of the Commission, and Aneta Wilkinson, Jay Dee Chase, Patrice Dills \n2 \n \n\n \n¶¶1.34-1.40].  Defendant Howard H. Hendrick is the Director of the Department of Human \nServices.  [Dkt. #2, ¶41; Dkt. #227, ¶1.41].   \n  At the time this case was brought, more than 10,000 foster children in Oklahoma were in \nthe legal custody of DHS.  [Dkt. #2, ¶1].  In their Complaint, plaintiffs alleged children who \nrequire placement in foster care are the most vulnerable members of Oklahoma society.  They \nare found in the four corners of the State; they come from cities, suburbs and rural areas.  [Dkt. \n#2, ¶2; Dkt. #227, ¶1.2].  They stated, “In all cases, these children find themselves in DHS \ncustody as a result of desperate and extreme circumstances that threaten their ability to live \nnormal childhoods, to grow and develop and, in many instances, to even survive.”  [Dkt. #2, ¶3; \nDkt. #227, ¶1.3].   \n  Under the Oklahoma Children’s Code, state district courts take jurisdiction over children \nwho are or who are alleged to be abused or neglected.  10A O.S. § 1-4-101(A).  Courts \nparticipate in many decisions regarding abused or neglected children.  10A O.S. §§ 1-4-\n101(A)(2)(b), 1-4-201(A)(2); 1-4-202, 1-4-102(C), 1-4-205(C), 1-4-206, 1-4-601, 1-4-703, 1-4-\n706(A)(4), 1-4-706(B)(2)(a), 1-4-707, 1-4-709, 1-4-806, 1-4-811, 1-4-904. \n  The rules promulgated by the Commission are included in the Oklahoma Administrative \nCode (“OAC”) 340: Chapter 75. Child Welfare.  The Child and Family Services Division \n(“CFSD”) of the DHS provides professional advice to the DHS for the making of child welfare \npolicy, supports child welfare workers in the field by providing professional advice regarding \npolicy and implementation, provides Continuous Quality Improvement (“CGQI”) for child \nwelfare and manages the KIDS computer system. [Dkt. #561-19 Ex. 18-1, Decl. of Deborah G. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nDouglas, Michael L. Peck, Garoldine Webb and Rev. George E. Young were members of the \nCommission. \n \n3 \n \n\n \nSmith, MSW, ¶2].  KIDS is one of only nine federally approved State Automated Child Welfare \nSystems (“SACWIS”) in the nation.  [Id.].    Professional Child Welfare staff of the CFSD \nconsult, and have consulted, with the Commission’s policy committee to ensure that newly \npromulgated rules are professionally sound.  [Id., ¶3].  The rules and “Instructions to Staff” for \neach such rule are available on line at http://www.okdhs.org/library/policy/oac340/075/.  [Id.].  \nThe rules on the website contain links to related statutes and the Instructions to Staff to assist \nworkers seeking additional information about particular aspects of the rule. [Id.].  \nA. Commission Oversight \n  The Commission usually meets monthly for two to three hours.  [Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, \nAneta Wilkinson Dep., 70:14-21; Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Steven Dow Dep., 102:16-20; Dkt. \n#601-23, Ex. 23, Michael Peck Dep., 88:21-25].  Steven Dow, who was appointed to the \nCommission after this lawsuit was filed, testified that in his opinion, “the meetings are rather \nperfunctory and not very engaging with respect to the level of oversight that the Commission is \nproviding.” [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22. Dow Dep., 103:15-18].   \n  Commissioners generally do not set the agenda, but consider only the information \nselected and provided by the Director and senior DHS managers.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, \nHendrick Dep., 29:5-14; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., 187:15-188:7].  Commissioner Dow \ntestified that in his tenure, the Commission has never been told anything negative about the \nperformance of DHS’s child welfare operations, or any shortcomings “that we as a Commission \nought to know whether self-identified or identified by an outside body.”  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, \nDow Dep., 70:21-71:7, 108:4-14].  Director Hendrick testified in recent history no other person \nhas come in and talked to the Commissioners about any of the department’s data or practices that \nwas troubling to them.  [Dkt. 601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 33:7-13].  Commissioner \n4 \n \n\n \nDeVaughn could not remember whether there have been any reports to the Commission on rate \nof abuse in care, the number of placements per child, the number of permanency plans put in \nplace by the department, the length of stay in custody of foster children, out-of-county \nplacements, family separations, or the shortage of foster care homes available for children in the \ncustody of the state.  [Dkt. #602-2, Ex. 27, DeVaughn Dep., 23:23-25:21].  He testified regarding \nmissed caseworker visits, that “Most all information is presented in forms, but as to getting down \nto the specific items, I can’t recall…specificity on those.”  [Id., 24:23-25:8].   \nCommissioner Michael Peck does not remember receiving any data on services such as \nindependent-living services provided to children, caseworker visits to children, visits between \nchildren and their parents, visits between workers and children’s parents, or worker caseloads.  \n[Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, 106:15-107:13]. He does not think the Commission has ever been \nprovided with any updates about DHS’s performance on federal standards for foster children.  \n[Id., 132:19-21].  He does not remember asking for, or being given information about, abuse and \nneglect in care for calendar year 2011 to date, and does not know if it is trending up or down.  \n[Id., 145:25-146:8].  He does not recall the Commission receiving any data on caseworker \nvisitation.  [Id., 152:17-20].  He recalls no discussions about placement stability at Commission \nmeetings.  [Id., 159:11-14].  There has been no discussion about how DHS is doing on meeting \nits own policies with respect to visits between children and their parents and between workers \nand parents.  [Id., 175:11-20].  He does not know whether there has recently been overcrowding \nand overcapacity at the DHS’s two shelters.  [Id., 199:25-200:8].   \nCommissioner Linda Weeks testified she was unaware that from 2005 to 2008, \nOklahoma was among the bottom five states in the country on the federal government’s measure \nof abuse in care.  [Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 95:12-23].  She was unaware of how the \n5 \n \n\n \nOklahoma DHS performed in the data on abuse in care for 2009 or 2010.  [Id., 96: 8-14].  She \ncannot recall any discussions about shelters other than the locations of the two shelters DHS has.  \n[Id., 115:18-23]. \n  Commissioner Aneta Wilkinson testified that although she does not have any specific \nrecollection of discussions about caseloads, she is sure there have been discussions, and the \ndiscussions would be reflected in minutes of the meetings.  [Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Wilkinson \nDep., 128:20-129:19].  Similarly, she did not recall discussion about placement and stability at \nthe Commission meetings, but stated they would be reflected in the minutes of the meetings.  \n[Id., 145:14-20].   \n  Commissioner George Young testified commissioners receive monthly reports used to \nmeasure the performance of children in the custody of DHS.  [Dkt. #602-1, Ex. 26, Young Dep., \n27:16-25].  He did not think the reports included a rate of abuse in care.  [Id., 28:22-29:1]. \n  Commissioner Dow does not recall any discussion of child welfare worker caseloads at \nthe Commissions meetings.  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, 176:2-5].  He has not asked for, nor been \ngiven, any information by DHS that would help him evaluate caseload levels, although he \nbelieves he could ask for the information.  [Id., 176:22-177:6].  Dow recalls no discussion at \nCommission meetings about worker/parent or worker/child contacts or whether those policy \nexpectations are being met.  [Id., 194:7-14; 195:4-6]. \n  In accordance with state law, DHS was accredited by the Council on Accreditation \n(“COA”) from 1985 to 2002.  [10A O.S. § 1-9-105(A)(4); Dkt. #602-3, Ex. 28, Lettter from \nCOA to Hendrick, COA-5-00012].  In September 2002, DHS chose not to renew its \naccreditation.  [Dkt. #602-3, Ex. 28, Letter from Hendrick to COA, COA-5-00010].  The \nOklahoma DHS remains unaccredited to date.  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional \n6 \n \n\n \nMaterial Fact ¶6].  Current commissioners were unaware of the Oklahoma statute requiring COA \naccreditation or DHS’s violation of it, although the Commission at the time was.  [Dkt. #601-24, \nEx. 24, Hendrick Dep., 128:12-129:2; Dkt. #602-2, Ex. 27, DeVaughn Dep., 77:24-78:3, 78:16-\n23, 83:4-19; Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 217:10-23; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., \n203:23-204:15; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 128:25-129:2; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, \nWilkinson Dep., 213:23-214:6; 214:15-21, 215:1-6; Dkt. #602-1, Ex. 26, Young Dep., 55:15-24, \n56:24-57:3, 57:14-15, 61:25-62:4, 62:16-17]. \n  Finally, plaintiffs’ expert John Goad opines that no fewer than 64 (18.6%) and as many as \n157 (45.8%) of 343 DHS investigations into reports of maltreatment of foster children during \n2009, the investigators’ findings were flawed.  [Dkt. #610-2, Ex. 31, Goad Report, pp. 37-38].  \nPlaintiffs contend this is additional evidence of defendants’ failure to exercise professional \njudgment.3 \nB. Use of Objective Standards in Child Welfare \n    Plaintiffs’ expert, John Goad, A.M., stated in his report: \n  CWLA and COA standards generally describe reasonable practice.  Who would \n  suggest that it is reasonable for CPS investigations to be anything but thorough, \n  that it is acceptable for foster parents to have violent criminal backgrounds, or  \n  that foster children should be seen any less often than once per month?  Child \n  welfare caseloads that exceed the standards are not reasonable because they \n  prevent caseworkers from effectively doing the work necessary to achieve safety, \n  permanency and well-being for the children who depend on them. \n \n  Considering the importance of child welfare services to the children who receive \n  them, it is not possible to reasonably conclude that child welfare agencies should \n  be held to any lesser standard than those that have been established by the CWLA \n  and the COA.  If airline pilots were held only to standards of mediocrity, no one \n  would choose to fly.  The difference is that children have no choice about their  \n  involvement with the child welfare system. \n \n                                                 \n3 The issue of abuse in care rates is more fully discussed in § I(C) below. \n7 \n \n\n \n[Dkt. #610-2, Ex.31, Report of John Goad, A.M., p. 4].  Defendants’ expert John D. Fluke \ntestified he believes information about whether an agency has complied with its own policies and \nstandards, coupled with an examination of outcomes, is useful in determining whether the \nagency is doing its job.  [Dkt. #602-7, Ex. 32, John Flukes Dep., 205:10-15]. \n  In March 2008, the federal government reported that DHS failed to meet all six CFSR \nnational standards reviewed and also failed to meet all seven safety, permanency, and well-being \noutcomes.  [Dkt. #602-8, Ex. 33, Final Report, Oklahoma Child and Family Services Review, \nMarch 2008].   \nC. Abuse in Care \n  The federal government tracks the rate at which children are abused or neglected while in \nstate foster care (the “abuse-in-care rate”).  The rate is calculated by taking the number of child \nvictims of maltreatment perpetrated by foster parents and facility staff, and dividing it by the \nnumber of children served in foster care during the reporting year.  [Dkt. #602-12, Ex. 36,Child \nMaltreatment 2009, p. 24].   \nFor every year from federal fiscal year (“FFY”) 2002 through FFY 2010, DHS’s abuse-\nin-care rate has been 1.54 to 3.97 times greater than the federal standard.  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ \nStatement of Additional Material Facts, ¶12 and Ex. 37, NCANDS-DP-00001; Ex. 38, Dkt. \n#602-14 at 2; Ex. 39, Dkt. #602-15 at 2; Ex. 40, Dkt. #602-16 at 9; Ex. 5, Dkt. #602-5 at 3.] \nFrom FFY 2002 to FFY 2008, DHS’s reported abuse-in-care rate was among the five highest \nreporting jurisdictions in the country.  [Id., ¶12 and Ex. 43 PLAINTIFFS 01220.1-01220.2; Ex. \n44 Children’s Bureau, Child Maltreatment 2004, 64; Ex. 36, Child Maltreatment 2009, 53].   \nAdditionally, DHS does not report to the federal government any instances of \nmaltreatment committed by facility staff members.  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiff’s Statement of \n8 \n \n\n \nAdditional Material Facts, ¶13 and Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep. 70:13-24].  Defendants acknowledge \nthat at least 154 children in 2009 and 80 children in 2010 were maltreated by facility staff.  [Id., \n¶14 and Ex. 45 Lee Decl. ¶¶1-2].  If the 154 children had been included in DHS’s reported \nabuse-in-care data for 2009, DHS would have reported a total of 241 children abused by foster \nparents and facility staff during that year, setting DHS’s abuse-in-care rate at 1.58%--almost five \ntimes the federal standard.  Likewise, if the other 80 children had been included in DHS’s \nreported abuse-in-care data for FFY 2010, DHS would have reported a total of 183 children \nabused by foster parents and facility staff during that year, setting DHS’s abuse-in-care rate at \n1.41%--more than four times the federal standard.  [Id., Ex. 37 NCANDS-DP-00001].   \nThe number reported by DHS also does not include children abused by their birth parents \nwhile in DHS custody.  [Dkt. #601-9, Andrew Barclay Dep., 161:15-162:3].    Defendants’ \nexpert Andrew Barclay testified that such maltreatment should be considered to obtain a fuller \npicture of abuse-in-care.  [Id., 162:7-15].  According to DHS data, 210 children in FFY 2009 and \nanother 191 children in FFY 2010 were maltreated by their birth parents while in DHS custody.  \n[Dkt. #561, Ex. 18-2 Row XI]. \nD. Worker Caseloads \nDHS managers and Commissioners admit that manageable caseloads for child welfare \nworkers are important to ensure that children are kept safe from harm.  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, \nDow Dep., 175:16-176:1; Dkt. #602-25, Ex. 49, Gary Miller Dep., 229:19-230:6; Dkt. #603-2, \nEx. 52, Deborah Smith Dep., 144:16-145:3; Dkt. #603-3, Ex. 53, Joanie Webster Dep., 48:17-\n49:18, 51:14-52:5, 52:19-53:13; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 39:5-40:3; Dkt. #601-3, Ex. \n3, Amy White Dep., 184:14-24; Dkt. #603-4, Ex. 54, Marq Youngblood Dep., 224:15-23; Dkt. \n#601-23, Ex. 23, Peck, 38:1-39:2].  Similarly, both plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts \n9 \n \n\n \nacknowledge the importance of reasonable caseloads in protecting foster children.  [Dkt. #603-5, \nEx. 55, Affid. of Peg Hess, PhD, ACSW, ¶7(a); Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 2, Viola Miller, Ed.D. Report, \n34, 37; Dkt. #603-6, Ex. 56, Larry Brown Dep., 85:15-86:16; Dkt. #720-1, Ex. 29, Robin \nArnold-Williams Dep., 141:8-142:12].  \nExtensive child welfare research links high caseloads to poor decision making, increased \nturnover and worse outcomes for children.  [Dkt. #604-2, Ex. 77, U.S. General Accounting \nOffice, Report to Congressional Requesters, Child Welfare: HHS Could Play a Greater Role in \nHelping Child Welfare Agencies Recruit and Retain Staff, pp. 3-4, 14, 19-21; Dkt. #604-3, Ex. \n78, D.

Lawson et al., Retention Planning to Reduce \nWorkforce Turnover in New York State’s Public Child Welfare Systems (2005), pp. 11, 41]. \nCOA standards provide that permanency planning worker caseloads should not exceed 18 \nchildren or 8 children with special needs.  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional \nMaterial Facts, ¶25 and Dkt. #602-3, Ex. 28, PA-FC 19.06, PA-KC 16.06].  CWLA sets out \nsimilar standards.  [Dkt. #603-7, Ex. 57, CWLA Standards for Foster Care Services, § 3.48, KC \n§ 4.20]. \n10 \n \n\n \nEvery child in DHS custody is assigned a “primary” caseworker who is located in the \ncounty of juvenile court jurisdiction.  When a child is placed outside the county of court \njurisdiction, the child is also assigned a “secondary” worker in the county of placement.  OAC §§ \n340:75-1-29, 340:75-6-48.  DHS managers have testified that both primary and secondary \nworkers have equal and important responsibilities and both must be taken into account when \ncalculating workers’ caseloads.  [Dkt. #603-8, Ex. 58, Johnson Dep., 85:3-20, 115:13-118:3; \nDkt. #603-2, Ex. 52, D. Smith Dep., 145:4-23; Dkt. #601-3, Ex.3, White Dep. (5/12/11), 188:17-\n189:9].  As of May 2011, 41% of children in DHS custody were placed outside the county of \ncourt jurisdiction.  [Dkt. #603-10, Ex. 60, DHS Placement Summary, Y1617A-00380-81].   \nDHS’s “YI743 report” as of March 2011 shows that more than 5,300 children in out-of-\nhome care (68% of the total number of such children) had a primary caseworker whose caseload \nwas greater than 20 children; more than 3,000 children had a primary worker whose caseload \nwas greater than 25 children; and more than 1,200 children had a primary caseworker whose \ncaseload was more than 30 children. [Dkt. #600, Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional Material \nFacts, ¶34 and Dkt. #603-15, Ex. 65, YI743 Report “built on December 7, 2010”].   \nLarry Johnson, Director of the DHS Field Operations Division (“FOD”), acknowledged \nthat another report he uses to track average worker caseloads—referred to as the Combined \nWorkload Report (“CWR”)—omits some part of the caseloads from its calculation of average \nworkloads, and thus understates the average number of children assigned to permanency \nplanning workers for at least some counties.  [Dkt. #603-11, Ex. 61, Combined Workload \nReport; Dkt. #603-8, Ex. 58, Larry Johnson Dep., 75:13-20, 101:22-24, 108:7-20; 110:10-111:1, \n112:24-113:22, 114:13-18]. \n11 \n \n\n \n  Defendants’ own expert, Robin Arnold-Williams, concluded that DHS does not \naccurately measure caseloads and that its caseloads exceed generally accepted levels.  [Dkt. \n#601-10, Ex. 10, Arnold-Williams Report, pp. 5-6]. \n  Dr. Arnold-Williams testified issues with caseloads continue [Dkt. #720-1, Ex. 29, \nArnold-Williams Dep., 144:18-19], that caseloads in Oklahoma have to be reduced [Id., 145:21-\n145:2], that current reporting practices hamper effective caseload and workload monitoring [Id., \n150:15-151:3], and that in her opinion, “the best professional judgment would be to seek more \nstaff and to...reduce [caseloads] down lower, which I have recommended in [my report].  [Id., \n216:16-217:19].  Defendants’ expert Larry Brown opined that individual caseload or workload \nlevels are, at this point, known only “at an individual unit level.”  [Dkt. #603-6, Ex. 56, Larry \nBrown Dep., 85:6-10], that “there is no systematic way that the central office here—or in \nOklahoma City can know that information,” [Id., 87:4-21], that Johnson “doesn’t have the data \nthat he needs to manage the system,” that “[h]e’s working to develop a report to give him that \ninformation,” and “[t]hose are positive steps that demonstrate to me that there’s reasonable \nexercise of some professional judgment that’s being shown here.”  [Id., 103:13-104:1].  In her \nreport, plaintiffs’ expert Viola P. Miller opined that caseworkers were inadequately supervised \nand staff turnover is excessive.  [Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 2, Miller Report at pp. 45-50]. \nE. Worker-Child Visitation \nFederal law requires states to have a plan for child welfare services that describes the \nstate standards for frequency of caseworker visits, which, at a minimum, ensures that children in \nfoster care are visited by a caseworker on a monthly basis. 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(17).  DHS policy \nalso requires visits with each foster child a minimum of one time per month, with no less than \ntwo visits per quarter in the foster placement.  Ex. 168, Okla. Admin. Code (“OAC”) 340:75-6-\n12 \n \n\n \n48.  Each child is to be interviewed, or if an infant observed, alone without the foster parent \npresent at least one time per quarter.  Id.   \n  DHS Commissioners and managers, and experts on both sides, admit worker-child \nvisitation is important, that it is important for the same worker to visit the child each month and \nthat the visit should include one-on-one interactions with the child as well as observation of the \nchild’s interactions with others.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. #24, Howard Hendrick Depo., 173:8-176:1; \nDkt. #603-8, Ex. #58, Larry Johnson Depo., 59:11-60:10; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. #23, Michael Peck \nDepo., 37:4-25, 151:20-152:11; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. #25, Linda Weeks Depo., 35:7-36:25; Dkt. \n#601-21, Ex. 21, Aneta Wilkinson Depo., 15:17-16:5; Dkt. #603-4, Ex. #54, Marq Youngblood \nDepo., 213:9-24; Dkt. #720-1, Ex. 29, Robin Arnold-Williams Depo., 195:25-196:14; Dkt. #601-\n1, Foster Care Case Review of the OKDHS by Center for the Support of Families (CSF), Inc., \np.70].  Additionally, the federal government has found an association between caseworker visits \n(with children and parents) and positive outcomes for children.  [Dkt. #606-4, Ex. 129, Results of \nthe 2007 and 2008 Child and Family Services Reviews at 22-24; Dkt. #606-5, Ex. 130, “52 \nProgram Improvement Plans—Strategies for Improving Child Welfare Services and Outcomes,” \nat 36-38; Dkt. #606-6, Ex. 131, GAO Child Welfare report, at 24-25, 38.   \nPlaintiffs contend in practice, however, the requisite visits are not occurring.  Larry \nJohnson, Director of the DHS Field Operations Division (“FOD”), stated in his declaration that \nthe FOD is responsible for accurate and timely delivery of services to eligible clients of the \nCFSD, the Family Support Services Division and the AIDS Coordination Information Service.  \n[Dkt. #558, Ex. 8, Decl. of Larry Johnson, ¶2].  Approximately 1,000 of 3,700 FOD staff are \nchild welfare workers.  [Id.].  DHS keeps track of the number of visits or “contacts” of its \nworkers with foster children.  A copy of the report is attached to his declaration and referred to \n13 \n \n\n \nas Ex. 15-1, Contacts Report June 2011, run July 10, 2011.  [Id., ¶3]. Johnson states that  \nbetween 90% and 96% of children living in their own homes while in foster care jurisdiction \nreceived the required visits; between 96% and 98.6% of children in therapeutic foster care \n(“TCF”) placements received the required visits.  Of the 20 or fewer children in unpaid relative \nplacements each month, between 90% and 100% received the required visits each month.  \nJohnson states that data regularly kept by DHS indicated that, since July 2000, DHS workers \nhave made monthly visits to children in foster care due a visit over 90% of the time.  Since \nJanuary 2007, data shows DHS workers have made more than 95% of monthly visits in all but \ntwo months.  In those months, 94.2% and 94.9% of visits were made.  [Id., ¶3]. \n  However, the report, “Caseworker Visits: Visited Every Month (Required Federal \nReporting),” shows that 3,707 children—32% of all children in out-of-home care for at least one \nmonth as of December 2010—missed at least one monthly visit due that year (as contrasted with \nthe federal standard of only 10%).  [Dkt. #600, Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts \n¶64; Dkt. #606-7, Ex. 132].  Defendants’ expert, Robin Arnold-Williams, recommends in her \nreport that DHS should “[c]ontinue progress meeting federal expectations in the area of monthly \nvisitation between case workers and children.” [Dkt. #601-10, Ex. 10, A Review of Management \nof OKDHS’s Child Welfare System, Robin Arnold-Williams, D.S.W. at 7, 58]. \nF. Number and Array of Placement Resources \n  According to DHS policy, recruiting an adequate number of resource families for \nchildren in DHS custody “is a crucial component for providing safe home environments for \nchildren requiring out-of-home placement” and ensures that children live near their birth \nfamilies; placements meet children’s unique needs; and sibling groups remain together.  O.A.C. \n§ 340:75-7-10].   \n14 \n \n\n \nDHS reports from 2005 to 2009 show that the ratio of foster homes to children ranged \nfrom 0.28 to 0.32.  In 2009, there were 2,978 approved homes and 9,887 children, a ratio of 0.30.  \n[Dkt. #601-6, Ex. 6, Oklahoma Foster Care Data Summary 2009, BR-Grant-00070].   \nCommissioner Weeks testified there is a shortage of foster homes in Oklahoma.  [Dkt. #61-25, \nEx. 25, Weeks Dep., 73:2-74:8].  Commissioner Dow testified there are concerns about whether \nDHS has an adequate number of foster care homes.  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, 204:24-206:4, \n207:12-19].   \nDirector Hendrick testified there is a shortage of foster homes due to a high number of \nadoptions by foster parents since June of 2008, which has reduced the number of foster homes \navailable.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 191:2-193:6].  Annette Burleigh, a program \nmanager with DHS, testified that DHS does not have enough therapeutic foster homes for \nchildren in its custody.  [Dkt. #604-8, Ex.83, Annette Burleigh Dep., 82:13-83:4].  Deborah \nGoodman testified the number of adoptive homes is inadequate for the number of foster children \nwith a goal of adoption.  [Dkt. #604-9, Ex. 84, Goodman Dep., 249:13-251:16].  Deborah Smith \ntestified there was a concern about overuse of shelters, and DHS needs more foster homes.  [Dkt. \n#603-2, Ex. 52, D. Smith Dep., 52:24-53:5].  DHS programs administrator Joannie Webster \ntestified DHS does not have an adequate number of emergency foster care homes available [Dkt. \n#604-10, Ex. 85, Joannie Webster Dep., 199:1-6, 212:25-213] and there is a shortage of foster \nhomes, although the type of shortages vary from county to county. [Id., 212:23-213:10].   \n  DHS grant documents, evaluations by and for the federal government, and analysis by \nthird parties recognize the long-standing issue of lack of adequate placement resources.  [Doc. \n#604-12, Ex. 87, Diligent Recruitment of Families for Children in the Foster Care System, May \n29, 2008 grant application, #68&69-BR-Grant-1-00039; Dkt. #604-17, Ex. 92, Family \n15 \n \n\n \nConnection Discretionary Grants, OKB-Prog Nar-7.1.09-00018; Dkt. #601-6, Ex. 6, BR-Grant-\n00173, 00291, 00829; Dkt. #604-13, Ex. 88, DRG-BTF-Eval-10.09 to 3.10-00001; Dkt. #604-14, \nEx. 89, H_Hendrick-Docs-2008-00271; Dkt. #604-15, Ex. 90, PIP Strategy Summary and TA \nPlan, PLAINTIFFS 07519, 07521; Dkt. #602-17, Ex. 41, Child and Family Services Review \nProgram Improvement Plan, CFSR-PIP-2008-Rev 10.12.09-00023, 00025; Dkt. #602-18, Ex. 42, \nHC Franklin OKPIP Reminders and Talking Points, pp. 5, 7; Dkt. #601-14, Ex. 14, Performance \nAudit by Hornby Zeller Associates, Inc., p. 13]. \n  DHS often maintains waiting lists for group homes [Dkt. #604-10, Ex. 85, Webster Dep., \n163:6-164:2, Dkt. #604-20, Ex. 95, Monthly Waiting List Repts., pp. 8, 9, 35, 50, 65, 74, 89] and \nemergency foster care homes. [Dkt. #604-10, Ex. 85, Webster Dep., 198:3-199:6; Dkt. #604-17, \nEx. 92, Family Connection Discretionary Grants, OKB-Prog Nar-7.1.09-00006].  Although DHS \ndoes not maintain a centralized waiting list for therapeutic foster homes, the responsible DHS \nmanager acknowledged that “as long as I’ve been in the position I don’t believe we’ve had \nenough therapeutic foster homes.”  [Dkt. #604-8, Ex. 83, Burleigh Dep., 82:6-83:4]. \n  DHS has acknowledged placement availability “as a major issue in stability of \nplacements and appropriate placements for children in out-of-home care.  Generally placements \nare made based on available space rather than the individual needs of the child, skills of the \nfoster parents or both.”  [Dkt. #604-17, Ex. 92, OKB-Prog Nar-7.1.09-00018].  Due to the large \nnumber of children entering emergency custody in Oklahoma’s two metropolitan counties, DHS \nis not always able to meet its goal of placing children under six years of age in emergency foster \ncare within 24 hours of shelter admission. [Id., OKB-Prog Nar-7.1.09-00006].  In addition, there \nare times when children have to stay in emergency foster care in excess of the intended limit of \n16 \n \n\n \n30 days because of a shortage of regular foster homes.  [Dkt. #604-10, Ex. 85, Webster Dep., \n188:18-189:1]. \nPlaintiffs’ expert Peg M. Hess has opined that DHS has an “extreme placement shortage, \nincluding both an insufficient number and range of placements for children in custody,” which \nhas led to “dangerous and inappropriate placements.”  [Dkt. #610-1, Ex. 19, Hess Report, 111; \nDkt. #610-3, Ex. 103, Hess Supp. Report, 80].   \nG. Use of Shelters \n  Senior DHS managers and Commissioners admit that overall shelter use and length of \nshelter stays should be minimized because it is not in the child’s interest to remain in a shelter, \nshelters cannot meet all of children’s needs and children are better off in family-like settings.  \n[Dkt. #602-25, Ex. 49, Miller Dep., 95:14-97:11, 101:23-102:6; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck \nDep., 190:4-8; Dkt. #603-2, Ex. 52, D. Smith Dep., 67:18-24; Dkt. #605-4, Ex. 104, Nancy \nThompson Dep., 122:9-19; Dkt. #604-1, Ex. 85, Webster Dep., 197:10-12; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, \nWeeks Dep., 114:20-23; 115:8-17; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Wilkinson Dep., 156:4-157:5; Dkt. \n#601-22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 197:17-198:4].  Defendants’ expert Dr. Arnold-Williams \nrecommends that DHS reduce its use of shelters.  [Dkt. #601-10, Ex. 10, p. 57].  According to \nplaintiffs’ expert Dr. Miller, the overuse of emergency placements, including shelters, by DHS is \nharmful to children.  Specifically, “widespread use of temporary placements harms children by \njeopardizing their ability to form the emotional attachments that are crucial for their \ndevelopment.” [Ex. 2, Miller Rep., p. 65]. \n  According to DHS reports, the number of children placed in the two DHS-operated \nshelters has declined from 5,230 in 2006 to 3,167 in 2010.  [Dkt. #605-13, Ex. 113, Shelter Pop-\nAggregate Nos-00005].  However, the average daily shelter population has recently trended \n17 \n \n\n \nupward, from 53 in May 2010 to 104 in May 2011.  [Id., Shelter Pop-Aggregate Nos-00008].  \nAccording to DHS reports, in 2010, 24% (3,009 of 12,429) of the children in DHS custody were \nplaced in a shelter.  [Dkt. #605-11, Ex. 111, YI613-00181; Dkt. #603-1, Ex. 51, YI624-11267].  \nIn 2010, 635 shelter placements lasted longer than 30 days.  [Dkt. #603-1, Ex. 51, YI624-11266]. \nH. Placement Stability \n  A stated objective in Oklahoma law is to “promote stability for foster children and limit \nrepeated movement of such foster children from one foster placement to another.”  10A O.S. § 1-\n4-805(C).  Senior DHS managers, Commissioners and DHS documents acknowledge that \nfrequent placement moves and disruptions interrupt schooling, impair the ability of children to \nform attachments, and lead them to lack trust in adults [Dkt. #604-1, Ex. 76, Debra Clour Dep., \n115:9-24; Dkt. #603-3, Ex. 53, Webster Dep., 38:18-39:12; Dkt. #605-14, Ex.114, Patricia \nHowell Dep., 122:4-14; Dkt. #602-25 Ex.49, Miller Dep., 145:15-24; Dkt. #603-2, Ex. 52, D. \nSmith Dep., 139:11-21; Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 163:17-164:7; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. \n21, Wilkinson Dep., 144:8-145:13; Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 183:17-184:25; Dkt. #601-\n23, Peck Dep., 122:6-9].  Defendants’ expert Dr. Katherine Casillas admitted that multiple \nplacements can contribute to, and exacerbate, children’s pathologies.  [Dkt. #605-5, Ex. 105, \nKatherine Casillas Dep., 54:15-55:4; 79:12-17].  Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Hess opines that “[w]hen \nplacement changes are numerous and frequent, such as those experienced by all seven plaintiff \nchildren, they create an intolerable level of caregiver discontinuity, accompanied by chronic \ngrief, development regression, and other developmental and emotional problems.  [Dkt. #610-3, \nEx. 103, Hess Report, p. 88]. \n  According to data reported to the federal government, in FFY 2008 and 2009, Oklahoma \nranked 45th out of 51 jurisdictions nationwide on the Placement Stability measure.  [Dkt. #605-\n18 \n \n\n \n24, Ex. 124, OK-08-08b09a-DP2.23.10-00012; Dkt. #605-25, Ex. 125, PLAINTIFFS 06949].  \nAccording to DHS reports, 26% of children who had been in out-of-home care for less than 12 \nmonths had three or more placements in FFY 2009; in FFY 2010, that number rose to 28% \n(approximately double the federal benchmark of 13%). [Dkt. #606-1, Ex. 126, CFSR-PO-P1.2-\n00027, 43].  According to DHS reports, the number of children in DHS custody who had more \nthan 20 placements was 150 as of March 2010, and increased to 164 as of March 2011.  [Dkt. \n#606-2, Ex. 127]. \n  DHS managers and commissioners have expressed concern about DHS’s performance \nregarding placement stability.  [Dkt. #601-22, Ex. 22, Dow Dep., 186:6-188:6; 190:1-13; Dkt. \n#602-25, Ex. 49, G. Miller Dep., 147:25-148:10; Dkt. #603-2, Ex. 52, D. Smith Dep., 140:19-\n141:11; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., 163:17-164:7; Dkt. #604-14, Ex. 89, H_Hendrick-\nDocs-2008-00272]. \nI. Maintenance of Family Connections \n  According to DHS policy, “[t]he child and parent(s) have a right to regular visitation” \nwith each other more than once a month.  “Visitation is the single most predictive factor in \nwhether a child is successfully reunified.”  O.A.C. § 340:75-6-30.   \n  DHS managers recognize it is important to have frequent, consistent and substantive \nparent-child interactions.  [Dkt. #602-25, Ex. 49, G. Miller Dep., 154:1-156:1; Dkt. #601-3, Ex. \n3, White Dep., 269:16-270:24].  DHS representatives stated at a 2009 conference addressing \nplacement stability that parent-child visits lessen children’s anxiety, depression and behavior \nproblems.  [Dkt. #605-15, Ex. 115,CFSR-PIP-2009TO2011-QR-00053, 106]. \n  According to DHS reports, from 2008 to 2010, between 85% to 88% of parent-child \nvisits were not completed.  [Dkt. #607-17, Ex.167, YI624-05991; Dkt. #607-14, Ex. 164, YI624-\n19 \n \n\n \n00008; Dkt. #603-1, Ex. 51, YI624-11271].   DHS’s federally submitted Program Improvement \nPlan listed “[i]nadequate parent/child visitation,” “[l]ack of quality visitation which promotes \nparent/child/sibling bonds,” and “[i]nadequate child and family engagement” as “[k]ey [i]ssues.”  \n[Dkt. #602-17, Ex. 41, CFSR-PIP-2008-Rev. 10.12.09-00022-23].   \n  Additionally, under federal statute, Oklahoma law and DHS policy, siblings in foster care \nare to be placed together unless doing so would be contrary to their well-being.  If siblings are \nplaced separately, they must have frequent visitation or other interactions.  42 U.S.C. § \n671(a)(31)(A)-(B); 10A O.S. § 1-7-107; O.A.C. §§ 340:75-6-30, 340:75-6-85.3.  DHS field \nliaisons have emphasized that sibling contact improves outcomes for children, increases \nplacement stability, increases the likelihood of reunification and is important to well-being.  \n[Dkt. #606-15, Ex. 140, CWFL-MN-11.14.07-00016-17].  Plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts \nagree that sibling separation can contribute to children’s pathologies.  [Dkt. #605-5, Ex. 105, \nCasillas Dep., 66:12-67:8; Dkt. #605-22, Ex. 122, Eugene Reynolds, Ph.D., Report, p. 10]. \n  According to an internal DHS report, as of December 2010, 2,726 children were not in \nthe same placement as all of their siblings.  [Dkt. #606-19, Ex. 144, YI684-Q#360-02987-\n03152].  Plaintiff’s expert Dr. Milner found that 72% of eligible children in his sample did not \nhave all required visits with their siblings in separate placements during the 12 months prior to \nJune 1, 2010, and 22% of eligible children had no visits with siblings in any of the 12 months.  \n[Dkt. #601-1, Ex. 1, CFS Report, p. 79]. \nJ. Permanence \n  DHS managers and commissioners acknowledge that it is DHS’s responsibility that \nchildren in custody exit quickly and safely to a permanent home, either through reunification \nwith their birth family or through adoption.  [Dkt. #601-24, Ex. 24, Hendrick Dep., 210:9-16; \n20 \n \n\n \nDkt. #602-25, Ex. 49, G. Miller Dep., 194:16-195:3; Dkt. #601-23, Ex. 23, Peck Dep., 81:18-21; \nDkt. #603-2, Ex. 52, D. Smith Dep., 125:20-126:4; Dkt. #601-25, Ex. 25, Weeks Dep., 123:14-\n18; Dkt. #601-21, Ex. 21, Wilkinson Dep., 14:17-20, 30:1-9, 169:24-170:5; Dkt. #603-17, Ex. \n67, William Wilson Dep., 41:19-22; Dkt. #603-4, Ex. 54, Youngblood Dep., 24:6-25:17, 215:25-\n216:4]. \n  Plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts recognize the importance of achieving permanence \nquickly and safely because, inter alia, lengthy stays in custody negatively impact children’s \ndevelopment and well-being, and also make it less likely that the children will ever be placed in a \npermanent home.  [Dkt. #720-1, Ex. 29, Arnold-Williams Dep., 200:14-18; Dkt. #601-1, Ex. 1, \nCFS Report, pp. 57-58; Dkt. #601-2, Ex. 2, Miller Report, pp. 58-63]. \n  From FFY 2007 to 2010, the average length of time to permanent exit from foster care \nsteadily increased from 20.4 months to 25.9 months.  [Dkt. #607-5, Ex. 155].  Nationwide, the \naverage length of stay for children exiting foster care was 21.7 months in FFY 2010.  [Dkt. #607-\n6, Ex. 156, AFCARS Report, p. 4].  According to DHS reports, of those children who achieved \npermanence in 2010, it took longer than three years for 34% of them (620 of 1,844 children) to \ndo so.  [Dkt. #603-1, Ex. 51, YI624-11270].  Nationally, in FFY 2010, only 17% of children \nexiting foster care had been in foster care for more than three years.  [Dkt. #607-6, Ex. 156, \nAFCARS Report, p. 4]. \n  In state fiscal year 2010, only 8.2% of children with a goal of adoption were in trial \nadoptive homes.  [Dkt. #607-19, Ex. 169].  According to plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Milner, in his \nsample of 128 children who were free for adoption, 41% did not become free for adoption for \ntwo years or more.  Of the 244 children in his sample who were not free for adoption as of June \n1, 2010, 31% had been in custody for longer than two years and 23% had been in custody for \n21 \n \n\n \nlonger than three years.  Dr. Milner also found that many required adoption activities (e.g., \nidentifying an adoptive family, placement in a pre-adoptive home, referral to an adoption \nworker) had not taken place for children with a goal of adoption.  [Dkt. #601-1, Ex. 1, CSF \nReport, pp. 65-67]. \nK. DHS’s Practice Model \n  The DHS has developed a Child Welfare Practice Model Guide (“Practice Model”).  The \nPractice Model is “based on a study of best child welfare practices from across the nation, and \nwas developed through a process of consultation with many professionals at the OKDHS, \nincluding policy specialists as well as line staff.”  [Dkt. #561-19, Ex. 18, Declaration of Deborah \nG. Smith, MSW, ¶10].  The Practice Model focuses on the safety of children from receipt of a \nreferral call alleging abuse or neglect of a child through permanency. [Id.]. \nPlaintiffs criticize the Practice Model, arguing that it focuses almost entirely on how to \nassess the risk and safety of children who are not in custody and does not address many of the \nchildren face while in DHS custody, including placement moves, shelter stays, placement \nresources, time in custody and independent living services.  [Dkt. #600 at 37].  Further, they \ncontend the Practice Model does not adequately address safety issues.  [Id.].  Defendants’ \nconsultant/expert Dr. Sue Steib identified numerous areas needing attention.  [Dkt. #604-3, Ex. \n98, Sue Steib Dep., 75:7-24, 77:1-82:1; Dkt. #607-11, Ex. 161, Field Notes, pp. 1-5].  Steib \ntestified  that she was not aware of efforts yet taken to remedy all but one of these problems and \nthat many, if not all, of these issues put children at risk.  [Dkt. #604-3, Ex. 98, 77:1-82:1). \nL. Compliance With Statutory Requirements for Reporting \n  Under 10A O.S. §1-4-704(2010) (the successor statute to 10 O.S. § 7003-5.3 (2007)), \nDHS is required to prepare and maintain a written individualized service plan for any child who \n22 \n \n\n \nhas been adjudicated to be a deprived child.  DHS records show that for 2010, 94.2% of all such \nplans were delinquent as of January 5, 2011.  [Dkt. #603-1, Ex. 51 at YI624-11267].   \n  Under 10A §§ 1-4-810 and 811 (2010) (successor statutes to 10 O.S. § 7003-5.6(2007)), \nDHS is required, prior to permanency hearings for children who have been in out-of-home care \nfor 12 months or longer, to prepare a report that includes a proposed permanency plan.  \nSubsequent permanency hearings are to be held at least every six months for any child who \ncontinues to be in an out-of-home placement.  According to DHS reports, however, in 2010, it \nhad taken 37 months or more to complete permanency plans for 1,673 children.  [Dkt. #607-15, \nEx. 165, OKHS Outcome Indicator Report, Permanency—Length of Time of Achieve Plan].   \n  In interrogatory responses, plaintiffs identified 131 children who they allege did not \nreceive adequate procedural due process under 10A O.S. §1-4-704(2010) and 10A O.S. §§ 1-4-\n810 and 811 (2010) “because by June 10, 2010, each child had three or more consecutive \npermanency goals during their time in DHS custody and a meaningful permanency report is not \npossible with constantly changing permanency goals.”  [Dkt. #561-13, Ex. 12 at 10].   \n  Under 10A O.S. § 1-40-902(2010) (the successor statute of 10 O.S. § 7006-1.6 (2007)), \nthe district attorney is required to file a petition or motion for termination of the parent-child \nrelationship and parental rights under certain enumerated circumstances, including before the end \nof the fifteenth month when a child has been placed in foster care by DHS for 15 of the most \nrecent 22 months.  The district attorney is not required to file such a petition where the \ndepartment has documented a compelling reason for determining that filing a petition to \nterminate parental rights would not serve the best interests of the child, or where the state has not \nprovided to the family of the child, consistent with the time period in the state case plan, services \nthat the state deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the child’s home.  Id.   \n23 \n \n\n \n  In interrogatory responses, plaintiffs identified 64 children they have been deprived of \ntheir entitlements under 10A O.S. § 1-40-902(2010) because each was not timely placed on a list \nfor termination of parental rights (“TPR List) in a timely manner.  [Dkt. #561-13, Ex. 12 at 33-\n36].  Additionally, plaintiffs cite a DHS report showing that termination of parental rights \npetitions were not filed for 79% of children in custody for 15 of the prior 22 months [Dkt. #607-\n23, Ex. 173] and a DHS report showing that as of December 2010, the average length of time \nbefore foster children’s parental rights were terminated was 18-20 months.  [Dkt. #607-24, Ex. \n174. \n  Under 10 O.S. § 1-7-103(1)(e)(2010) (the successor statute to 10 O.S. § 7004-1.1 \n(2007)), DHS is  required to provide educational instruction to children through enrollment in a \npublic school or an alternative program consistent with the needs and abilities of the child.  \nPlaintiffs have identified 41 children they allege did not receive their constitutionally protected \ninterests in adequate educational services.  [Dkt. #561-13, Ex. 12 at 105-106].  In addition, \nplaintiffs point to the expert report of Dr. Milner, who concluded based a review of a sampling of \nchildren that 90.7% of the individualized service plan materials contained no educational \nstability plan and 56.2% of school-aged children had a school change at initial placement \nunrelated to graduating from one level to another.  [Dkt. #601-1, Ex. 1, Foster Care Case Review \nof the ODHS by Center for the Support of Families (CSF), Inc., p. 74]. \nII.  Standard of Review \n  Summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 is appropriate where there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Celotex \nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n250 (1986); Kendall v. Watkins, 998 F.2d 848, 850 (10th Cir. 1993).  “The plain language of \n24 \n \n\n \nRule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon \nmotion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an \nelement essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at \ntrial.”  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 317. \n  “When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do \nmore than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material fact. . . . Where \nthe record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving \nparty, there is no ‘genuine issue for trial.’”  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., \n475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986) (citations omitted).  In its review, the court construes the record in \nthe light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.  Garratt v. Walker, 164 F.3d \n1249, 1251 (10th Cir. 1998).  “The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the \nplaintiff’s position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the [trier of fact] could \nreasonably find for the plaintiff.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.  In essence, the inquiry for the \ncourt is “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury \nor whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Id. at 251-52. \nIII.  Analysis \nA.  Substantive Due Process Rights Violations (First Cause of Action) \nChildren in the custody of the state have a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due \nprocess right to be reasonably safe from harm.  Yvonne L. v. New Mexico Dep’t. of Human \nServices, 959 F.2d 883, 892-93 (10th Cir. 1992).  Officials may be held liable for a violation of \nthis right when it is shown that they have failed to exercise professional judgment.  Id. at 893-94.  \nThe Tenth Circuit has stated: \n“Failure to exercise professional judgment” does not mean mere negligence… \nwhile it does not require actual knowledge the children will be harmed, it \n25 \n \n\n \nimplies abdication of the duty to act professionally in making the placements. \n \nId. at 894.  “Such abdication must be sufficient to shock the conscience.”  Johnson v. Holmes, \n455 F.3d 1133, 1143 (10th Cir. 2006). \nIn order to establish standing to pursue their claims, plaintiff must show (1) they have \nsuffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed \nby the relief sought.  Tandy v. City of Wichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1283 (10th Cir. 2004).  Where—\nas here—plaintiffs seek prospective relief, plaintiffs “must be suffering a continuing injury or be \nunder a real and immediate threat of being injured in the future.”  Id. At the summary judgment \nstage, the elements of standing must be set forth, through specific facts, by affidavit or other \nevidence.  Id.    \n  Plaintiffs have presented evidence that from 2002 through 2008, the reported rate of \nabuse or neglect of Oklahoma foster children has been 1.54 to 3.97 times greater than the federal \nstandard.  Oklahoma had one of the five highest reported rates in the country from 2002 through \n2008.  Further, Oklahoma’s reported numbers do not include instances of abuse or neglect in \nstate foster care facilities, which would have substantially boosted the reported rate, or of abuse \nof children by their birth parents while the children were in the legal custody of the state.  The \ncourt finds this evidence creates a genuine dispute of material fact about whether foster children \nin Oklahoma are being harmed or put at imminent risk of harm. \n  Plaintiffs have also presented evidence of serious issues with inadequacy of placement \noptions, overuse of shelters, and lack of placement stability in the foster care system.  The \nsummary judgment evidence shows an overall shortage of foster homes, and shortages of \n26 \n \n\n \ntherapeutic and emergency foster homes; a shortage of group homes; and a shortage of adoptive \nhomes.  Plaintiff’s expert opined that the shortage has led to dangerous and inappropriate \nplacements.  Further, the evidence shows that while the number of children placed in the two \nDHS shelters declined from 2006 to 2010, the average daily population has trended upward from \nMay 2010 to May 2011.  Children under the age of six are being placed in shelters for more than \n24 hours.  At times, children are being kept in shelters longer than 30 days.  Plaintiffs’ expert \nopines that the overuse by DHS of emergency placements such as shelters is harmful to children \nbecause it jeopardizes their ability to form emotional attachments that are crucial for their \ndevelopment.  Finally, plaintiffs have presented evidence that Oklahoma ranks 45th out of 51 \njurisdictions nationwide in the area of placement stability, that 26% of children who had been in \nout-of-home care for less than 12 months had three or more placements in FFY 2009 and that \nnumber increased to 28% in 2010.  The number of foster children who had more than 20 \nplacements was 150 in March 2010 and increased to 164 as of March 2011.  Plaintiff’s expert \nopined that excessive placement changes cause chronic grief, development regression and other \ndevelopmental and emotional problems.4  \n  Defendants assert there is no causal link between defendants’ policies, practices or \nprocedures and harm or risk of harm to children.  However, plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts, \nas well as defendants and senior DHS managers, all agree that excessive caseloads, missed visits \nbetween case workers and children, and  inadequate investigations of abuse and neglect pose a \nthreat to the safety of foster children, and that inadequate placement options, excessive use of \nshelters and frequent placement moves threaten the psychological and emotional health of \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs, in presenting evidence that inadequate placement options, use of shelters and \nfrequent placement moves result in psychological harm or risk of psychological harm to children, \nassume that the “harm” or “risk of harm” standard set out in Yvonne apply not only to physical \nharm, but psychological harm as well.  Defendants do not challenge this assumption.  \n27 \n \n\n \nchildren.  Further, plaintiffs have presented evidence—albeit disputed—that defendants’ \noversight of the DHS foster care program is so inadequate as to give rise to a question of material \nfact whether defendants have abdicated their professional judgment.   \nThe court concludes plaintiffs have presented proof sufficient to create a genuine dispute \nof material fact about whether defendants’ policies, practices and procedures violate plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process right to be reasonably safe from harm. \nTherefore, defendants’ motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ first cause of action \nfor violation of substantive due process rights is denied. \nB.  Right of Familial Association (Second Cause of Action) \nPlaintiffs contend defendants’ policies, practices and procedures interfere with their First, \nNinth and Fourteenth Amendment liberty and privacy rights.  Plaintiffs assert that while DHS \npolicy requires visits between parents and children and placement of siblings together whenever \npossible, DHS’s own records from 2008 to 2010 reflect that less than 15% of visits due between \nfoster children and their biological parents were completed, and DHS has a routine practice of \nseparating siblings in custody.   \nCourts recognize that certain personal relationships must be afforded a “substantial \nmeasure of sanctuary from unjustified interference by the State.”  Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 \nU.S. 609, 618 (1984).  However: \nNot every statement or act that results in an interference with the rights of  \nintimate association is actionable.  Rather, to rise to the level of a constitutional  \nclaim, the defendant must direct his or her statements or conduct at the intimate \nrelationship with knowledge that the statements or conduct will adversely affect that \nrelationship. \n \nGriffin v. Strong, 983 F.2d 1544, 1548 (10th Cir. 1993).   \n28 \n \n\n \n  The evidence presented at summary judgment does not establish the requisite conduct or \nstate of mind described in Griffin.  Conceivably, individual plaintiffs could show specific DHS \nworkers failed to ensure that children met with their parents or other family members, and thus, \nthe workers’ conduct was “directed at the intimate relationship with knowledge the conduct \nwould adversely affect the relationship.”5  However, the same cannot be said about these \ndefendants.  They are responsible for setting policy and for oversight of DHS operations and \nactivity, but they do not deal with foster children directly.  At most, the evidence might support a \nconclusion that defendants failed to adequately supervise workers who were charged with the \nresponsibility of ensuring parent-child visitation occurred.  However, plaintiffs have failed to \npresent evidence of conduct by any of these defendants directed at any plaintiff with knowledge \nthat his or her conduct would adversely affect that plaintiff’s familial relations.   \nPlaintiffs’ claim is also subject to summary judgment because—while individual children \ncan establish acts by DHS workers that have violated their right of familial association—a class-\nwide deprivation cannot be proven.  Under Griffin, an actual infringement of the right is required \nto establish a claim for violation of the right of familial association.  Id. at 1549.  In contrast, \nunder Yvonne, a claim for violation of a foster child’s substantive right of due process arises \nwhen the child is either harmed or placed at “risk of harm.” Yvonne L., 959 F.2d at 892-93.6  \nPlaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that a violation of the right of familial \n                                                 \n5 In Griffin, for example, the wife of a man who was the subject of a child abuse investigation \nsued a police officer who participated in the investigation for interfering with the couple’s \nfamilial relationship.  983 F.2d at 1545. \n \n6 The Tenth Circuit, in the appeal of the district court’s grant of class certification of this case, \nnoted, “In theory, 100% of foster children could live under an imminent threat of serious harm.”  \nDG, 594 F.3d at 1198. \n29 \n \n\n \nassociation occurs when a child is put “at risk” of a deprivation; rather, an actual deprivation \nmust have occurred.   \nFor these reasons, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs’ Second \nCause of Action. \n \nC.  Procedural Due Process Violations (Fourth Cause of Action) \n  Plaintiffs contend defendants’ policies and practices systematically deprive or threaten to \ndeprive them of state entitlements without procedural safeguards.  See Ky. Dept of Corr. v. \nThompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462 (1989); Tri-State Contractors, Inc. v. Fagnant, 393 F. App’x 580, \n584 (10th Cir. 2010).   \nPlaintiffs recite violations of Oklahoma statutes pertaining to procedural rights of foster \nchildren, including the right to individualized treatment and service plans under 10A O.S. § 1-4-\n704 (2010) (successor statute to 10 O.S. § 7003-5.3 (2007)); the entitlement to drafts of semi-\nannual, meaningful reports pursuant to 10A O.S. §§ 1-40-810 and 811 (2010) (successor statutes \nto 10 O.S. § 7003-5.6 (2007)); the entitlement to being identified on a list to the district attorney \nwhen they have been in custody for 15 of the prior 22 months, pursuant to 10 O.S. §§ 1-4-902 \n(2010) (successor statute to 10 O.S. § 7006-1.6 (2007)); and the entitlement to suitable \neducational instruction pursuant to 10A O.S. §1-7-103 (2010) (successor statute to 10 O.S. § \n7004-1.1 (2007)). \nThe Supreme Court has stated: \nTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an  \nabstract need or desire for it.  He must have more than a unilateral expectation of  \nit.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.  \n \n*     *     * \nProperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution.  Rather, they are \n30 \n \n\n \ncreated and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that \nstem from an independent source such as state law-rules or understandings that  \nsecure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlements to those benefits. \n \nRoth v. Board of Regents, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).  Because the statutes at issue confer upon \nfoster children specific rights or entitlements, the court finds the plaintiff children are entitled to \nprocedural due process protection of those entitlements.    \n  To establish a procedural due process violation, a plaintiff must prove two elements:  (1) \nthat he possessed a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest such that due process \nprotections were applicable; and (2) that he was not afforded an appropriate level of process.  \nCouture v. Bd. of Education of the Albuquerque Public Schools, 535 F.3d 1243, 1256 (10th Cir. \n2008).  Additionally, the Supreme Court has held that in order to hold officials liable for a \nprocedural due process violation under § 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate the officials’ \ndecisions “have cause the deprivation of rights at issue by policies which affirmatively command \nthat it occur, or by acquiescence in a long-standing practice or custom which constitutes the \n‘standard operating procedure’ of the local government entity.”  Jett v. Dallas Ind. School Dist., \n491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989) (citations omitted).7  \n  Plaintiffs have established the first element of a procedural due process claim, i.e., that \nthe statutes at issue create entitlements to which procedural due process protections attach.   \n                                                 \n7 Defendants contend that under Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989), Bd. of County Comm’rs \nof Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 411 (1997), and Connick v. Thompson, ---U.S.---, 131 S.Ct. \n1350 (2011) the applicable standard of culpability is “deliberate indifference.”  The court \ndisagrees.  Those cases all involved claims of procedural due process violations based on \nofficials’ alleged failure to train employees.  Because “[a] municipality’s culpability for a \ndeprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train,” the court \nheld that a municipality’s failure to train its employees in a relevant respect “must amount to \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the untrained employees come into \ncontact.”  Connick, 131 S.Ct. at 1359 (quotations and citations omitted).  “Only then can such a \nshortcoming be properly thought of as a city policy or custom that is actionable under § 1983.”  \nId. at 1359-60. \n31 \n \n\n \nHowever, the second element of the claim—that plaintiffs were not afforded the appropriate \nlevel of procedural due process—has only been shown with respect to specific children identified \nin interrogatory responses.  Perhaps those children have individual claims for violation of their \nprocedural due process rights, but plaintiffs assert only class-wide claims. \nIt is impossible, however, for the class as a whole to establish the second element of a \nprocedural due process claim because most children’s procedural due process rights have not \nbeen violated.  Plaintiffs contend all members are “at risk” their procedural due process rights \nwill be violated.  However, they cite no authority for the proposition that being “at risk” meets \nthe requirements for establishing a procedural due process violation.  Moreover, they do not \nclaim, nor do they provide evidence, that all members have been denied an appropriate level of \nprocess. \nTherefore, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claim for alleged \nviolations of the plaintiff children’s right to procedural due process. \nIV. Conclusion \n  For the reasons set forth below, defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. #561] \nis denied with respect to plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action.  It is granted with respect to plaintiffs’ \nSecond and Fourth Causes of Action. \n  ENTERED this 1st day of December, 2011. \n   \n \n \n \n \n32 \n ",
