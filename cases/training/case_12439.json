The plaintiffs alleged that as a result of the defendant's policies and practices, African-American and Hispanic borrowers unfairly paid higher prices for automobile lending products in comparison to Non-Hispanic white borrowers of similar financial backgrounds. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant marked up or increased interest rates charged to African American and Hispanic car purchasers regardless of their credit worthiness.  As a result, the increased interest rate causes an overall higher cost of credit to the consumer.  </p><p>The plaintiffs and defendant filed a joint motion for approval of a preliminary settlement agreement on February 18, 2003.  After various revisions and appeals of that settlement agreement, the Court (Judge Todd J. Campbell) entered a final order on March 27, 2003. As part of the settlement agreement, NMAC agreed to: 1) a cap on markup charges; 2) a credit-preapproval program designed to offer \"nomarkup\" rates to pre-approved African American and Hispanic car buyers; 3) contribute $1 million over the next five years to three national consumer financial education programs; 4) mail an educational brochure in english and spanish to existing customers annually for five years; and 5) provide written disclosure on financing contracts forms that a customer's annual percentage rate may be negotiable with the dealer.  Upon approving the settlement agreement, the Court  (Judge Todd J. Campbell) dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>",

      "text": " \nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS \nNMAC AUTO LOAN SETTLEMENT \n \n1.  What is Markup? \n \n  When the American consumer goes on an automobile lot to purchase a \nvehicle and requests the dealer to arrange financing, the loan is not made by the \ndealer. The dealer acts as an originator/arranger between the consumer and a \nlender. There are many lenders in the American automobile business, including \nbanks and finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers (captives). \n \n  When a consumer requests financing from the dealer, typically the dealer \nfaxes the consumer’s credit application to a lender who determines an approved \ninterest rate by examination of the consumer’s credit history. The lender then \ncommunicates the approved interest rate to the dealer and authorizes the dealer \nto markup the interest rate, without informing the consumer. The dealer and the \nlender then split the markup, as additional profit. \n \n  Thus, markup is the additional charges added to the consumer’s approved \ninterest rate, and split between the dealer and the lender. \n \n2.  What is the Effect of Markup? \n \n  Markup increases the cost of credit to the consumer. Remember, markup \nis only added after the lender determines an approved rate based on the \nconsumer’s credit history. [This approved rate is often called the \"buy rate\"]. \nMarkup is then added to the buy rate, and the result is a more expensive rate, \nwhich the consumer pays. \n \n3.  Are Consumers Told About Markup? \n \n  Generally, the answer is no. The lender authorizes the dealer to add \nmarkup to the approved rate (buy rate), but prohibits the dealer from telling the \nconsumer either: (1) the approved rate; or (2) that the approved rate has been \nmarked up. Generally, the consumer does not know about markup, never knows \ntheir approved rate, and does not realize that their interest rate has been secretly \nincreased. \n \n4.  How Can a Consumer Learn Whether their Interest Rate Was                  \nMarked Up? \n \n  Markup is not disclosed on any document given to the consumer by the \ndealer or by the lender. Usually, the dealer is prohibited by the lender from telling \nthe consumer about markup. However, both the dealer and the lender know \n \n\n \nexactly how much the consumer has been marked up and have records \ncontaining information about the markup.     \n \n  Thus, in order to learn whether or not a loan has been marked up, the \nconsumer should contact their lender and their dealer, and specifically request \ninformation about whether or not their loan was marked up. \n \n  When contacting the lender and the dealer, the consumer should have \ntheir loan or account number available and specifically request: (1) whether or \nnot the lender allows interest rates to be marked up by dealers; (2) whether or \nnot the consumer’s loan contains markup; (3) what buy rate was approved after \nreview of the consumer’s credit application; (4) how much markup was added to \nthe approved buy rate; and (5) how much of the markup was retained by the \nlender. The consumer should specifically request that this information be \nprovided to them by a corporate representative in writing. \n \n5.  What is a Captive Finance Company? \n \n  Generally, there are two types of lenders in the American automobile \nfinancing business, banks and captive finance companies. A captive finance \ncompany is essentially a lender owned by an automobile manufacturer. \nExamples are GMAC (General Motors Acceptance Corporation), NMAC (Nissan \nMotor Acceptance Corporation), Ford Credit (Ford Motor Credit Company), \nChrysler Credit (Daimler-Chrysler). Typically, these companies are wholly owned \nsubsidiaries of automobile manufacturers. The business of captives is to provide \nfinancing for customers through dealerships. \n \n6.  Do Both Banks and Captive Finance Companies Allow Dealers to \nMarkup Interest Rates? \n \n  Generally, yes. Although there are some exceptions, the large captive \nfinance companies and the large banks all authorize dealers to markup customer \ninterest rate, and split the profits.  \n \n7.  What is the Danger of Markup? \n \n  Markup results in the cost of credit being determined by factors other than \nthe consumer’s credit history, or credit worthiness. By authorizing dealers to \nincrease a consumer’s cost of credit, without regard to the consumer’s credit \nhistory, the lenders are causing some consumers to pay more for the same \nextension of credit. For example, the markup system may allow your credit to be \nincreased because you are African-American, or because you are Hispanic, or \nbecause you are old. These factors have nothing to do with a consumer’s credit \nhistory, and should not determine the price of credit. Also, because the markup \nsystem is hidden from the consumer, many people, black and white, believe they \n \n\n \nare getting their approved credit rate when actually that rate has been increased \nwithout their knowledge. \n \n8.  What is the Equal Credit Opportunity Act? \n \n  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a federal law, which prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital \nstatus, or age in any aspect of a credit transaction. Thus, pursuant to the ECOA it \nis unlawful to discriminate in the cost of credit between persons of different races. \nThe ECOA attempts to guarantee a consumer’s history or credit worthiness will \ndetermine the cost of credit not a consumer’s race or age. \n \n9.  Why Has the ECOA Been Used in the Federal Cases Involving Markup? \n \n  In the case of Cason v. NMAC, a Federal District Court in Nashville, \nTennessee, ordered data production that has allowed an analysis of deal files, \nwhich shows that as a result of markup, African-Americans and Hispanics are \npaying more for the same credit than similarly situated white car buyers. Plaintiffs \ncontend that African-Americans and Hispanics are more often victimized by the \nmarkup system, causing African-American and Hispanic customers to pay more \nfor the same credit. Plaintiffs contend that this effect of the markup system \nviolates ECOA.     \n \n10.  What Is Cason v. NMAC about? \n \n  The plaintiffs in this case contended that African-Americans and Hispanics \nwho purchased automobiles through NMAC paid higher prices for credit because \nthey received higher markups. The plaintiffs contended that as a result of markup \npricing, NMAC discriminated against African-Americans and Hispanics as a \nclass.   \n \n11.  Has the Case of Cason v. NMAC Been Settled? \n \n  Yes. The case was set for trial in Tennessee in February 2003, and a \nsettlement agreement was filed that month. On March 24, 2003, the U.S. District \nCourt in Nashville, Tennessee, approved the settlement agreement.  \n \n12.  What are the Major Terms of the Settlement Agreement? \n \n  NMAC has agreed to do the following: \n \n  a.   Limit the amount of markup on certain automobile loans; \n  b.  Disclose to consumers that loan rates are negotiable and can be \nnegotiated with the dealer; \n \n\n \n  c.  Fund consumer literacy programs directed to African-Americans \nand Hispanic communities which will help consumers understand the loan \nprocess and help consumers negotiate better loans; and \n  d.  Offer 675,000 no markup loans to African-Americans and Hispanics \nover the next five years. \n \n \n13.  What is a Pre-Approval No Markup Offer? \n \n  NMAC will examine the credit history of NMAC customers and potential \ncustomers who are African-American and Hispanic and send 135,000 offers of \nno markup loans for the purchase of new or used Nissan vehicles each year. \nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics receiving these offers will be approved for an \ninterest rate based solely on their credit history. This interest rate cannot be \nmarked up by the dealer. The offers also will indicate whether the consumer \nqualifies for any special interest loan offers for specific Nissan models. The \ncertificate will be good for at least 30 days. During this period of time, the \nconsumer can take the certificate to a Nissan dealer and purchase an automobile \nwithout further credit qualification, and without paying any markup.   \n \n14.  What is the Value of the Pre-Approval Certificate? \n \n  First, the consumer is pre-approved for a loan at a certain interest rate and \nwill not be required to further qualify for credit at the dealership. Second, the \ndealer is not allowed to markup the interest rate. Typically, this will save the \nAfrican-American and Hispanic consumer at least $750.   \n \n15.  How Can I Receive a Pre-Approval No Markup Certificate? \n \n  If you are a current African-American or Hispanic NMAC customer or if \nyou are a current Nissan vehicle owner, you may receive a Pre-Approval No \nMarkup Certificate without doing anything. NMAC will be examining its customer \nrecords for African-Americans and Hispanics who are eligible for future financing \nand mailing Pre-Approval No Markup offers directly to them. \n \n16.  What if I Have Individual Claims for Damages Against NMAC? \n   \n  Individual claims for damages against NMAC are excluded from the \nsettlement. Therefore, you may accept the benefits of the pre-approval no \nmarkup certificates without waiving any of your personal claims or releasing \nNMAC from any potential liability for damages. In order to recover such \ndamages, however, you will have to bring your own case against NMAC. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n ",

      "title": "Minority Auto Buyers Benefit from NMAC Settlement",
      "text": "For Immediate Release For More Information Contact:\nJune 25, 2003\nStuart Rossman, NCLC (617) 542-8010\nLisa Navarrete, NCLR (202) 785-1670\nSteve Brobeck, CFA (202) 387-6121\nKeiana Peyton-Barrett, RPC (773) 373-3366\n \nWashington DC—Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. (NMAC) and minority car buyers recently finalized the\nsettlement of a lawsuit charging that NMAC’s credit financing policy resulted in African Americans and\nHispanics paying more in finance charges than whites. Consumer and civil rights groups called the settlement\na significant step in their efforts to eliminate the industry practice of hidden markups that lead to\ndiscriminatory auto lending rates.\nThe lawsuit, filed in 1998 alleged that car dealers were more likely to increase or “mark up” the interest rate\ncharged to black or Hispanic car buyers. The suit also contended that when a markup was charged, the\naverage markup for black and Hispanic car buyers was greater than for white buyers with similar financial\nbackgrounds.\n“This settlement is important as it marks the first time a finance company has stepped up to be part of the\nsolution to discriminatory lending practices in auto financing,” commented Stuart Rossman, an attorney with\nthe National Consumer Law Center who represented the plaintiffs in this suit. “However,” Rossman noted,\n“NMAC is only one small player in the auto finance industry. We are hopeful that this settlement will serve\nas a starting point for other lenders as we continue our work to eliminate discriminatory lending practices.”\nUnder the terms of the settlement, NMAC will offer preapproved “no markup” loans based on customer\ncreditworthiness to hundreds of thousands of current and potential black and Hispanic Nissan owners. The\ncompany will also limit how much it raises the interest rates charged to car buyers above the minimum\nacceptable rate, (the markup) and will contribute $1 million over the next five years to low-income and\nminority consumer education programs.\n“This settlement provides real value for car buying consumers,” said Rossman. “The family car is one of the\nlargest purchases most families make—second only to buying a home. The preapproved loan program\ntogether with funding for consumer education gives us an important opportunity to demystify the financing\nprocess for car buyers.” Rossman went on to say that, “as a result of this settlement, hundreds of thousands of\nminority car buyers will be informed of the lowest interest rate they qualify for—armed with this knowledge,\nthey will now be able to negotiate their finance rate just like they negotiate the car’s purchase price.”\n“Recognizing that disparities exist in the auto financing arena is an important step toward ensuring fair\ntreatment for all consumers, regardless of race and ethnicity. We hope and expect that the NMAC case will\nbe a pioneering example that other companies in the industry will soon follow, “ said Raul Yzaguirre,\n\nNational Council of La Raza President. In December, NCLR wrote to NMAC urging them to take steps to\nensure greater fairness in the auto buying process.\n“NMAC has taken a significant step to address the issue of discriminatory auto lending,” said Stephen\nBrobeck, Executive Director of the Consumer Federation of America. “CFA has been active in the fight\nagainst predatory lending practices and we will continue to raise awareness of this issue with car buying\nconsumers in the future. “\n“America’s underserved consumers need to be armed with the realities of automotive financing. The NMAC\nsettlement serves as a proper first step towards acknowledging the inequities within the industry,” said Bonita\nParker, National Director of Rainbow/Push, 1000 Churches Connected program a national financial literacy\nprogram for African American churches.\nAn important aspect of the settlement is the $1million in grants to national consumer and minority consumer\neducation programs. Through this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought a major commitment to consumer education\naround ways to avoid these charges. Funds be granted to Consumer Federation of America’s “America\nSaves” program, National Council of La Raza’s financial education initiative and the Rainbow/Push\nCoalition’s 1000 Churches Connected program.\n“America Saves is a nationwide campaign that helps individuals and families save and build wealth,” said\nCFA’s Brobeck. “Through education, advice and encouragement we work to assist consumers to save for a\ncar, a home or for retirement. Funds granted by the NMAC settlement will allow us to tailor America Saves\nprograms and materials to minority car buyers to ensure that they make well informed auto finance\ndecisions.”\n“We want to express our appreciation to NMAC and the attorneys for the plaintiffs in this case for\nrecognizing that a critical aspect of this settlement is educating consumers about their rights and\nresponsibilities in the car buying process. Their support will enable NCLR to bolster its financial literacy\nprograms and develop curricula specifically targeted to Latino customers, “ noted Yzaguirre.\n“One Thousand Churches Connected is an initiative of Rev. Jesse L. Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition,”\nnoted Parker. “The program provides information on debt elimination and credit management,\nhomeownership, asset protection, wealth accumulation and consumer automotive awareness. Rainbow/PUSH\nCoalition commends the remedies NMAC is implementing to address “mark up” practices in the minority\nauto lending process. Rainbow/PUSH looks forward to the sustained efforts of NMAC and others in the\nautomotive finance industry. “\nThe case, Cason et. al. v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. was filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Tennessee at Nashville.\nA set of Frequently Asked Questions regarding the lawsuit and settlement agreement can be viewed here.\nAn outline of the settlement agreement can be viewed here.",

Box 65998\nWashington, DC 20035-5998\n(202) 514-9694\n\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nCongress enacted the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA\"),\n15 U.S.C.§ 1691, in 1974 to prohibit the denial of credit on the\nbasis of gender or marital status. As a result of Congressional\nhearings that demonstrated the pervasiveness of lending\ndiscrimination, Congress amended the ECOA in 1976 to prohibit\ndiscrimination based upon race, national origin and age. See \nPub. L. No. 94-239, 114 Stat. 246 (1976); S. Rep. 94-589, at 5-6\n(1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 403. Congress also\nauthorized the Attorney General to enforce ECOA by bringing civil\nactions whenever there is evidence of a \"pattern of practice\" of\ndiscrimination. 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(g) and (h). Accordingly, the\nUnited States has a significant interest in judicial\ninterpretations of ECOA, and respectfully submits this amicus\nbrief to the Court.\nThis case raises the question of whether a creditor may\nimmunize itself from liability under ECOA by delegating aspects\nof the credit transaction -- such as the setting of finance\ncharges -- to a third party. The United States believes that a\ncreditor has a non-delegable duty to refrain from discriminating\nunder ECOA; therefore, it is no answer under ECOA for a creditor\nto claim that it was not responsible for discriminatory pricing\nof loans that it approved and funded. Furthermore, the United\nStates believes that acceptance of such an excuse for\n\ndiscriminatory pricing would significantly hinder the\neffectiveness of ECOA, as well as the United States' enforcement\nefforts.\nBACKGROUND \nI. PLAINTIFFS'STATEMENT OF FACTS \nPlaintiffs allege the following facts:\nNissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (\"NMAC\") makes\nautomobile loans throughout the United States through Nissan\ndealers, who refer customers to NMAC and effectively serve as\nloan arrangers. See Plaintiffs' Response to NMAC's Statement of\nUndisputed Facts (\"Pl. Res.\") at 45-50, 59. Nissan dealers\nsubmit credit applications to NMAC, as well as other lenders, on\nbehalf of customers. Id. at 50. NMAC, using a credit scoring\nsystem, assigns applicants to a credit risk category. Id. at  52.\nFor each risk category, NMAC sets a range of acceptable interest\nrates. Id. The lowest acceptable rate is called the \"buy rate.\"\nId. A dealer may move a customer to a more expensive risk\ncategory (or \"tier\"), but not to a less expensive one. Id. at\n2 5 .\nIf the dealer charges only the buy rate, it receives a flat\nfee of approximately $150 for its participation in the\ntransaction. Id. at 19. If the dealer charges an interest rate\nabove the buy rate (effectively an overage), NMAC and the dealer\nsplit the discretionary finance charge with approximately 3/4\n\ngoing to the dealer. Id. at 16, 19. For certain promotional\nprograms, a dealer may be permitted to charge customers only the\nbuy rate. Id. at 25. Although NMAC contends that the dealers\nset the discretionary finance charge based on their own\nindependent assessment of a customer's risk, the dealer does not\nbear any risk. Id. at 53. In fact, the dealer never owns the\nloan. Id. at 10. Rather, the dealer prepares a contract on an\nNMAC approved contract form, and each contract must be\nspecifically approved by NMAC. Id. at 53-54. The contract is\nbetween the borrower and the dealer, but the contract is\nsimultaneously assigned to NMAC. Id. at 4, 11-12.\nPlaintiffs, Betty T. Cason and Robert F. Cason, purchased a\nNissan vehicle in August, 1995 from Action Nissan in Nashville,\nTennessee. Id. at 55-57. Plaintiffs applied for financing at\nthe dealer by filling out an NMAC application. Id. The dealer\nfaxed the application to NMAC, which determined that the Casons\nfell into the \"SPL tier\" credit risk category. Id. The dealers\ncharged the Casons an interest rate of 19.49%, the maximum\nallowable rate for their credit tier. Id. Plaintiffs, who are\nAfrican-American, claim that NMAC's rate-setting policy, which\npermits dealers to set the interest rate within an NMAC-approved\nrange, results in dealers charging African-Americans higher\ninterest rates than whites who present a comparable credit risk.\nPlaintiffs have offered evidence that African-Americans pay an\n\naverage of $461.97 more in discretionary finance charges than\nwhites, and that this difference cannot be explained by non-\ndiscriminatory factors. See Plaintiff's Response in Opposition\nto NMAC's Motion to Exclude the Report of Dr. Debby A. Lindsey at\n4 -5.\nII. DEFENDANT'S MOTION\nOn May 31, 2000, NMAC filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\nSummary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P.\n56(c). The United States submits this brief in support of\nPlaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to NMAC's Motion for Summary\nJudgment.\nIn its motion, NMAC argues that plaintiffs' claims under\nECOA must be rejected. See NMAC's Memorandum in Support of\nSummary Judgment (\"Def. Mem.\"). First, NMAC contends that it\nbears no responsibility for the conduct of Nissan dealers and,\nthus, the only potentially liable party under ECOA is the dealer\nitself. Id. at 9, 29-30. NMAC argues that it could only be held\nliable for a dealer's discriminatory conduct under ECOA if it\nwere aware of the discrimination before it participated in the\n4\n\ncredit transaction. Id. at 26. Second, NMAC argues that\nplaintiffs may not proceed under a disparate impact theory\nbecause they have not identified a neutral NMAC policy that\nresulted in their alleged injuries. Id. at 28. NMAC contends\nthat plaintiffs' alleged injures stem from the dealers' disparate\n.(cid:9) treatment, not from NMAC's financing policies.' Id. at 9, 32.\nLEGAL DISCUSSION\nI.(cid:9) AS A CREDITOR, NMAC IS SUBJECT TO LIABILITY UNDER ECOA FOR\nRACIAL DISPARITIES IN FINANCE CHARGES IN LOANS THAT IT\nAPPROVED AND FUNDED.\nA.(cid:9) Both NMAC and the Dealers Are Creditors Under ECOA and\nSubject to ECOA's Broad Prohibition Against\nDiscrimination\nECOA provides:\nIt shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate\nagainst any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a\ncredit transaction --\n(1) on the basis of race, color, religion,\nnational origin, sex or marital status, or age .\n15 U.S.C. §1691(a). Regulation B, promulgated pursuant to ECOA,\ndefines creditor as \"a person who, in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, regularly participates in the decision of whether or\nnot to extend credit. The term includes a creditor's assignee,\ntransferee, or subrogee who so participates.\" 12 C.F.R.\n1 NMAC also argues that plaintiffs' claims are time barred,\nthat plaintiffs have failed to offer competent evidence regarding\nthe alleged discrimination, and that the FTC Holder Language, 16\nC.F.R. Ch. 1, Part 433, is inapplicable. This brief does not\naddress those arguments.\n\n202.2(1). For purposes of ECOA's general prohibitions against\ndiscrimination, the definition also includes a \"person who, in\nthe ordinary course of business, regularly refers applicants or\nprospective applicants to creditors, or selects or offers to\nselect creditors to whom requests for credit may be made.\" Id. \nBoth NMAC and the dealers are thus creditors under ECOA and\nsubject to its anti-discrimination provisions. Plaintiffs'\nalleged facts state an ECOA claim against both. By charging\nhigher non-risk finance charges to African-Americans, the dealers\nviolated ECOA. Likewise, by approving and funding loans in which\nAfrican-Americans are charged a higher finance charge than\nsimilarly qualified whites, NMAC too violated ECOA.\n(cid:9)\nB. Because NMAC Has a Non-Delegable Duty to Comply with\nECOA, NMAC May Not Expressly Permit Dealers to Set\nFinance Charges and Then Disclaim Responsibility for\nthe Racial Disparities That Allegedly Resulted. \nIt is the position of the United States that ECOA, like the\nFair Housing Act, imposes a non-delegable duty not to\ndiscriminate.(cid:9) See, e.g., Marr v. Rife, 503 F.2d 735, 741 (6th\nCir. 1974) (\"[T]he duty to obey the law is non-delgable.\")\n(quoting United States v. Youritan Construction Co., 370 F. Supp.\n643 (N.D. Cal. 1973),aff'd in part, remanded in part by, 509 F.2d\n623 (9th Cir. 1975)). Both the Fair Housing Act and ECOA must be\nliberally construed to best effectuate the purpose of eradicating\ndiscrimination in credit transactions and to prevent creditors\nform profiting from invidious discrimination. See United States \n\nv. Landmark Financial Services Inc., 612 F. Supp. 623, 628 (D.\nMd. 1985) (\"Congress believed 'that strong enforcement of [the\nECOA] is essential to accomplish its purposes.\") (quoting S.Rep.\n589, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.); Silverman v. Eastrich Multiple \nInvestor Fund, L.P., 51 F.3d 28, 32-33 (3d Cir. 1995) (ECOA\nshould be interpreted so that creditors do not benefit from\ndiscrimination). Accordingly, courts regularly look to case law\ndeveloped under the Fair Housing Act to interpret ECOA. See \nShuman v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 453 F. Supp. 1150, 1153-54\n(N.D. Cal. 1978) (in absence of decisional law under ECOA, court\nlooked to Fair Housing Act); United States v. Beneficial Corp.,\n492 F. Supp. 682, 686 (D. N.J. 1980) , aff'd, 673 F.2d 1302  (3rd\nCir. 1981) (\"Although there is at this time a paucity of\nprecedent with respect to ECOA, analysis of the enforcement\nnetwork of the analogous Fair Housing Act . . has resulted in\nsimilar conclusions.\"); Emigrant Savings Bank v. Elan Management \nCorp., 668 F.2d 671 n.3 (2d Cir. 1982) (stating that ECOA claim\ndoes not require separate analysis from Fair Housing Act claim).\nThus, Fair Housing Act cases applying the non-delegable duty\ndoctrine should apply with equal force to plaintiffs' ECOA\nclaims.\nIn Marr, the Sixth Circuit held that the owner of a real\nestate company was liable for the discrimination of the company's\nagents under the Fair Housing Act, despite the fact that \"[t]here\n\nwas no evidence that [he] had personally joined in any\ndiscriminatory acts .(cid:9) \" 503 F.2d at 740. Similarly, in\nth\nWalker v. Crigler, 976 F.2d 900, 904 (4  Cir. 1992), the owner\nof property was liable under the Fair Housing Act regarding the\ndiscriminatory conduct of his manager, even though he\n\"specifically intended that [she] not discriminate.\" The Fourth\nCircuit reasoned that the property owner \"could not insulate\nhimself from liability for sex discrimination in regard to living\npremises owned by him and managed for his benefit merely by\nrelinquishing the responsibility for preventing such\ndiscrimination to another party.\" Id. at 904.2\n2See also Sanders v. Dorris, 873 F.2d 938, 944 (6 th Cir.\n1989) (\"Turning to the instant action, Chandler cannot escape\nliability by merely asserting that it instructed its agents not\nto discriminate against blacks.\"); Phiffer v. Proud Parrot Motor\nMotel, 648 F.2d 548, 552 (9th Cir. 1980) (\"The duty of the owner\nof such a facility to obey the laws relating to racial\ndiscrimination is non-delegable.\"); Walker v. Crigler, 976 F.2d\n900 (4th Cir. 1992) (\"Here we adopt the general rule applied by\nother federal courts that the duty of a property owner not to\ndiscriminate in the leasing or sale of that property is non-\ndelegable.\"); Alexander v. Riga, 208 F.3d 419, 432-33 (3 rd Cir.\n2000) (\"Here we adopt the general rule applied by other federal\ncourts that the duty of a landlord under the Fair Housing Act not\nto discriminate . . . may not be delegated to the landlord's\nemployee); Fair Housing Congress v. Weber, 993 F. Supp. 1286,\n1294 (C.D. Cal. 1997) (\"The direct evidence of discriminatory\nhousing practices at Vista de Anza Apartments does not\ndemonstrate the participation of defendants Charles Weber or 207\nAnza Associates. However, the duty not to discriminate under the\nFair Housing Act is nondelegable.\"); Saunders v. General Services \nCorporation, 659 F. Supp. 1042, 1059 (E.D. Va. 1987) (\"Thus, in\nthe instant case, while the Court finds credible Mr. Perel's\ntestimony that he did not intend to discriminate and that he\nsupports the goals of equal and open housing, as president of\nGSC, Mr. Perel had a non-delegable duty to ensure that GSC,\n\nAlthough many of the cases applying the non-delegable duty\ndoctrine have involved the actions of employees, the doctrine is\nnot limited by state law concepts of respondeat superior or\nagency. Marr v. Rife, 503 F.2d 735, 740 (6 th Cir. 1974).\nRather, in order to give effect to Congress\"broad legislative\nplan to eliminate all traces of discrimination,\" a court must\nlook to federal law to determine the appropriateness of imposing\nliability. Id. at 740-41; Cf. City of Chicago v. Matchmaker\nReal Estate Sales Center, Inc., 982 F.2d 1086, 1097 (7 th Cir.\n1992) (\"We note that whether an agency relationship exists for\npurposes of the Fair Housing Act is a question to be determined\nby federal law.\"); Northside Realty Assoc. Inc. v. United States,\n605 F.2d 1348, 1354 n. 13 (5 th Cir. 1979) (same).\nThus, NMAC's contention that the dealers are not its agents,\neven if true, is not dispositive of NMAC's liability.' Indeed,\nthe arguments that NMAC makes against its liability are the\nidentical arguments that were made -- and overwhelmingly\nrejected by courts -- in cases involving real estate agents under\nthe Fair Housing Act. See Heights Community Congress v. Hilltop\nthrough its employees, followed such goals and complied with the\nAct.\").\n' Defendant's denial of an agency relationship is actually\ncontradicted by the deposition testimony of the credit manager at\nAction Nissan, who stated that the dealer in fact did act as\nNMAC's agent. See Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition NMAC's\nMotion for Summary Judgment at 18.\n\nRealty, Inc., 774 F.2d 135, 141 (6' Cir. 1985) (\"This argument\n[that real estate agents are independent contractors] has\nconsistently been rejected in Fair Housing Act cases.\"). In\nthose cases, owners of real estate agencies claimed that real\nestate agents were independent contractors and not subject to\ntheir control. Rejecting these disclaimers of an agency\nrelationship, courts imposed liability based on the owners'\npractical ability to control the agents. See City of Chicago,\n982 F.2d at 1096-97 (discussion of cases rejecting claims that\nreal estate owners did not control agents).\nLiability under the doctrine of non-delegable duty turns,\ntherefore, not on a wooden application of vicarious liability\ndoctrine, but more broadly on the principal's exercise of control\nover the discriminatory conduct and whether the principal\nbenefitted from the discrimination. Cf. Markham v. Colonial \nMortgage Service Co., 605 F.2d 566, 571 (D.C. Cir. 1979)\n(finding no liability under ECOA where assignee neither\nparticipated in nor benefitted from discrimination); Whitfield v. \nCentury 21 Real Estate Corp., 484 F. Supp. 984, 986 (S.D. Tex.\n1979) (no liability under Fair Housing Act where elements of\nbenefit and control were absent). Both of these factors are\npresent in this case. According to facts set forth by\nplaintiffs, NMAC exercised complete control over the method of\nsetting interest rates for its borrowers. See Plaintiffs'\n- 10 -\n\nResponse to NMAC's Statement of Undisputed Facts at 45-54. The\ndealers set rates in strict conformity to NMAC's policies. For\nevery customer, NMAC set the permissible range of finance\ncharges, and created an incentive for the dealer to charge as\nmuch as possible. NMAC approved every loan application and its\nterms individually, and, of course, NMAC shared in the profits\nfrom the dealers' allegedly discriminatory conduct.\nIn fact, NMAC allegedly is a far more active participant in\nthe dealers' alleged discrimination than many of the defendants\nfound liable in the above cases. 4 NMAC designed and implemented\nthe very system that quite predictably resulted in the alleged\ndiscriminatory conduct by dealers. An NMAC senior executive,\ntestifying on behalf of NMAC, admitted that judgmental pricing\nwas antiquated and could lead to bias. See Plaintiffs'\nMemorandum in Opposition to NMAC's Motion for Summary Judgment\n(\"Pl. Opp.\") at 19-20. Despite this awareness, NMAC nonetheless\nimplemented a pricing policy that expressly authorized dealers to\nimpose at their discretion finance charges not based on risk.\nTo carry out its obligations under ECOA, NMAC could have\nestablished guidelines for the imposition of finance charges that\nwould prevent illegal bias. Alternatively, NMAC could have\nmonitored racial disparities in its loans. Although NMAC may not\ncollect racial information as part of the loan application\n4 See also section II(13).\n\nprocess, ECOA expressly permits a creditor to assess its fair\nlending compliance. 15 U.S.C. § 1691c-1. ECOA even provides\nincentives for creditors to monitor their compliance by making\nthe results of self-testing privileged so long as the creditor\nmeets certain requirements. Id.; 12 C.F.R. §202.15. NMAC has\n.(cid:9) demonstrated that it is fully capable of obtaining information\nregarding the race of its customers through drivers' records and\nother methods of racial identification. Pl. Resp. at 27-28.\nAdditionally, Nissan dealers were certainly aware of the race of\nNMAC borrowers. NMAC's argument that it is not possible for it\nto monitor racial disparities in its loans therefore is without\nmerit. See Def. Mem. at 28 n. 14.\nAccordingly, NMAC may be liable for the discriminatory\npricing of its loans as a result of dealers' discrimination. A\ncontrary interpretation would permit lenders to immunize\nthemselves from ECOA liability by delegating parts of the credit\ntransaction (such as the setting of overages) to third parties,\nwhile at the same time profiting from the resulting\ndiscriminatory conduct.\nII. NMAC'S ARGUMENT THAT IT CANNOT BE LIABLE IN THIS CASE UNLESS\nIT WAS ON NOTICE REGARDING THE DEALERS' DISCRIMINATION IS\nFLATLY CONTRADICTED BY THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF REGULATION B.\n- 12 -\n\nA. Regulation B Imposes a Notice Requirement Only As a\nPrerequisite to Holding a Creditor Liable for Another\nCreditor's Violation\nNMAC contends that the dealer is the only potentially liable\nparty under ECOA. In support of its position, NMAC cites 12\nC.F.R. §202.2(1), which provides that:\n[a] person is not a creditor regarding any violation of the \n[ECOA] or this regulation committed by another creditor \nunless the person knew or had reasonable notice of the act,\npolicy, or practice that constituted the violation before\nbecoming involved in the credit transaction.\n(emphasis supplied). This regulatory provision limits a\ncreditor's liability for another creditor's ECOA violation. It\ndoes not save NMAC from liability for its own violation, that is,\nfunding loans to African-Americans on less favorable terms than\nits loans to whites. This provision could come into play, for\nexample, if NMAC quoted higher buy rates to dealers serving\npredominantly minority communities for no legitimate business\nreason. In such circumstances, the dealer would not be violating\nECOA and would be liable for NMAC's violation only if it knew or\nwas on notice of NMAC's discrimination. Accordingly, this\nprovision of Regulation B does not require plaintiffs to prove\nknowledge in order to demonstrate NMAC's liability.\nB. In Any Event, Whether NMAC Was on Notice of the Alleged\nDiscrimination Is a Disputed Material Fact. \nEven if this regulatory provision applied to NMAC, whether\nNMAC was on notice of the allegedly discriminatory conduct is a\n- 13 -\n\ndisputed material fact that precludes summary judgment. Indeed,\nNMAC has admitted that discretionary underwriting may lead to\nbias, and, thus, \"the feds prefer credit scoring, it is non-\nbiased.\" See Pl. Opp. at 19-20. Cf. Roseman v. Premier\nFinancial Services-East, L.P., 1998 WL 066064 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 29,\n1998) (defendant not entitled to summary judgment where\n\"affidavits attesting to ECOA violations by [company from whom it\nbought loans] were a matter of public record. .(cid:9) .\") (attached).\nFurthermore, courts have long recognized that subjective decision\nmaking may lead to illegal bias. See, e.g., Miles v. MNC Corp.,\n750 F.2d 867, 871 (11th Cir. 1985).\nDespite this awareness of the risks of judgmental pricing,\nNMAC designed a policy that gave dealers unfettered discretion to\nset a non-risk based finance charge up to the rate ceiling for a\ngiven customer. Thus, NMAC necessarily knew – and indeed\nintended – that customers presenting identical risk profiles\nwould pay different interest rates for their auto loans. It\ndefies logic for NMAC, admittedly aware that discretion may lead\nto racial bias, to purposefully design and implement such a\npolicy and then claim that it could not have known of the alleged\ndiscrimination that predictably resulted. Finally, NMAC admits\nthat it sometimes knew the race of its borrowers because their\ndrivers licenses were often sent to NMAC. See Def. Mem.at 8\nn.8. Accordingly, plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence\n- 14 -\n\nfrom which a finder of fact could conclude that NMAC was on\nnotice of the dealers' discriminatory conduct.\nIII. ECOA CLAIMS MAY BE PROVEN THROUGH EITHER DISPARATE TREATMENT\nOR DISPARATE IMPACT ANALYSIS.\nAs addressed above, plaintiffs' claims are easily analyzed\nunder disparate treatment theory. Alternatively, plaintiffs may\nalso proceed under disparate impact theory. The legislative\nhistory of ECOA and Regulation B make clear that both theories\nare available to plaintiffs. See 12 C.F.R. § 202.6(a) n. 2 (\"The\nlegislative history of the act indicates that the Congress\nintended an 'effects test' concept .(cid:9) .\"); 12 C.F.R. Pt. 202,\nSupp. I., § 202.6(a),Official Staff Commentary on Regulation B.\nFurthermore, Congress intended that courts use disparate impact\ncases developed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nas a guide for ECOA claims. Id. Disparate impact and disparate\ntreatment are not mutually exclusive claims, rather they are\nmerely different theories of proof. See Watson v. Forth Worth\nBank and Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 987, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed.2d\n827(1988) (\"The distinguishing features of the factual issues\nthat typically dominate in disparate impact cases do not imply\nthat the ultimate issue is different than in cases where\ndisparate treatment analysis is used.\")\nAs NMAC concedes, disparate treatment analysis does not\nrequire any showing that the treatment was motivated by prejudice\nor a conscious intention to discriminate. See Def. Mem. at 34;\n- 15 -\n\nsee also 12 C.F.R. Pt. 202, Supp. I., § 202.4, Official Staff\nCommentary on Regulation B(\"Disparate treatment on a prohibited\nbasis is illegal whether or not it results from a conscious\nintent to discriminate.\"); see also Policy Statement on\nDiscrimination in Lending, 59 Fed. Reg. 18266-01, 18268 (April\n15, 1994). Rather, \"it is considered by courts to be intentional\ndiscrimination because no credible, nondiscriminatory reason\nexplains the difference in treatment on a prohibited basis.\" Id. \nCourts generally have looked to standards developed under Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when evaluating a disparate\ntreatment claim. See Mercado-Garcia v. Federal Bank, 779 F. Supp.\n620, 628 (P.Rico 1991) , aff'd 979 F. 2d 890 (1' Cir. 1992)\n(\"Courts which have interpreted ECOA have used the same\nanalytical framework as that used in actions pursuant to Title\nVII of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.\").\nTo prove a disparate impact claim, plaintiffs must prove\nthat NMAC applies a policy or practice equally to credit\napplicants, but the policy or practice has a disproportionate\nadverse impact on African-Americans and applicants from a group\nprotected against discrimination. See Policy Statement on\nDiscrimination in Lending, 59 Fed. Reg. 18266-01, 18269 (April\n15, 1994). NMAC must then demonstrate that the policy meets a\nlegitimate business need that cannot be accomplished by another\nmeans.(cid:9) Id.; 12 C.F.R. § 202.6(a)(2), Official Staff Commentary\n- 16 -\n\non Regulation B.\nPlaintiffs have identified a neutral NMAC policy (that is,\nNMAC's policy of expressly permitting the dealers to charge non-\nrisk based finance charges) that they allege disparately affects\nAfrican-Americans, and offered evidence to support their claim.\nNMAC, however, contends that plaintiffs' disparate impact claim\nmust fail because, at bottom, they are challenging disparate\ntreatment by dealers. See Def. Mem at 28-34. A policy that\npermits subjective treatment, NMAC argues, is not a neutral\npolicy for disparate impact purposes. Id. \nThis position has been squarely rejected by the Supreme\nCourt. In Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 990,\n108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed.2d 827 (1988), a Title VII case, the\ncourt held that \"disparate impact analysis is in principle no\nless applicable to subjective employment criteria than to\nobjective or standardized tests.\" Any other conclusion, the\nCourt reasoned, would permit an employer to \"insulate\" itself\nfrom disparate impact analysis by \"refrain[ing] from making\nstandardized criteria absolutely determinative.\" Id. NMAC's\nattempt to distinguish Watson because it is an employment case is\nunpersuasive and, indeed, curious. See Def. Mem. at 33-34. The\nlegislative history of ECOA makes clear that Congress expressly\nintended courts to look to Title VII when interpreting ECOA. See \n12 C.F.R. § 202.6(a) n. 2; 12 C.F.R. Pt. 202, Supp. I., §\n- 17 -\n\n202.6(a),Official Staff Commentary on Regulation B. Thus, that\nWatson is an employment case makes it more applicable t-o an ECOA\nclaim, not less.\nNMAC's claim that it would be inappropriate to hold it\nliable under a disparate impact theory because of its good faith\nreliance on Regulation B is also without merit. See Def. Mem. at\n36-37. Regulation B expressly states that disparate impact\nanalysis is available under ECOA. 12 C.F.R. § 202.6(a) n.2 and\nPt. 202, Supp. I., § 202.6(a) (2), Official Staff Commentary on\nRegulation B (\"The act and regulation may prohibit a creditor \npractice that is discriminatory in effect because it has a\ndisproportionately negative impact on a prohibited basis .\n.\") (emphasis supplied). Although the Official Staff Commentary\non Regulation B gives an example of a disparate impact claim, it\ndoes not purport to exhaustively list every factual circumstance\nin which the theory is appropriate. Accordingly, NMAC's\ncontention that plaintiffs may not proceed under a disparate\nimpact theory should be rejected.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States believes that\nNMAC's motion for summary judgment should be denied.\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\nWENDY H.
