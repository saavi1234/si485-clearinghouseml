The DOJ alleged that Citizens Bank had engaged in a discriminatory lending practice called redlining by unlawfully failing to provide its lending products and services on an equal basis to majority-minority census tracts in southeastern Michigan.  These allegations were based off of results from a routine bank examination completed by the Federal Reserve in 2007.</p><p>The two parties filed a proposed settlement agreement on May 5, 2011 after contentious negotiations.  According to the draft agreed order, the Defendant-lender agreed to open branch offices during the term of the settlement agreement, market its expansion to majority-minority census tracts, hire staff to specialize in community lending, and contribute funding to the City of Detroit to go towards a grant program that revitalizes housing.  </p><p>In a surprising turn of events, on May 10, 2011 the court (Judge Zatkoff) signed an order declining to accept the proposed settlement agreement that both parties had already agreed upon. The two parties retreated back to the negotiating table, reached their own settlement similar to the draft agreed order submitted to the court on their own, and the Department of Justice  with requested that the pending court case be dismissed with prejudice by the court.  On June 28, 2011 the court (Judge Zatkoff) agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice.  </p><p>Similar cases brought forth by the Department of Justice against lenders due to allegations of redlining include <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12465\">United States v. Centier Bank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12463\">United States v.

INTRODUCTION \nOn May 5, 2011, the United States filed a Complaint against Citizens Republic Bancorp, \nInc. (“CRBC”) and Citizens Bank (collectively, “Citizens Bank” or “the bank”) alleging that the \nbank has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of race and color in \nmajority-black census tracts in the Detroit metropolitan area in the operation of their residential \nlending, a practice commonly known as “redlining,”1 in violation of the Fair Housing Act \n                                                            \n1  “Redlining” is generally defined as mortgage credit discrimination based on the characteristics \nof the neighborhood surrounding the would-be borrower’s dwelling, and the term derives from \nloan officers evaluating home mortgage applications based on a residential map where integrated \n \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 4 of 21    Pg ID 38\n(“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), 15 U.S.C. \n§§ 1691 et seq.  Simultaneously with the Complaint, the United States and Citizens Bank jointly \nsubmitted for entry by the Court a proposed Agreed Order to resolve fully the claims of the \nUnited States.  See proposed Agreed Order attached as Exhibit A.  On May 10, 2011, the Court \nentered an order stating it would not enter the Agreed Order at this time because (1) no attorney \nhad filed a notice of appearance on behalf of Defendants; (2) Defendants had not filed  a \nStatement of Disclosure of Corporate Affiliations and Financial Interest as required by L.R. 83.4; \n(3) its internal inconsistencies; (4) the multiple deficiencies therein; and (5) the absence of a \nclear indication why it is necessary for the court to enter the Order.  Defendants filed a notice of \nappearance and Statement of Disclosure of Corporate Affiliations and Financial Interest on May \n11, 2011.  The United States now moves for entry of the proposed Agreed Order and in this \nmemorandum of law explains more fully the bases for its provisions.  The Defendants support \napproval of the Agreed Order and will file a separate document describing their reasons.  \nThe proposed Agreed Order is the product of approximately five months of intense \nnegotiations between counsel following an investigation by the United States and examination \nand referral from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board”).  The \nproposed Agreed Order represents a compromise by both sides, and as explained herein, is fair, \nadequate, and reasonable.  See Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921 (6th Cir. 1983) (setting \nforth the standard for consent decrees).  Each term within the proposed Agreed Order is \nnecessary and appropriate to achieve the parties’ purpose and is consistent with the FHA and \nECOA, which provides the statutory basis for the United States’ suit in this matter.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nand minority neighborhoods are marked off in red as poor risk areas.  Hood v. Midwest Sav. \nBank, 95 Fed. App’x 768, 2004 WL 771216, at *3 (6th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).  \n2 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 5 of 21    Pg ID 39\nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Referral  \nDuring 2007, Federal Reserve System bank examiners initiated a fair lending \nexamination of Citizens Bank for possible redlining activity.  The examination included an \nevaluation of lending data from 2006-2008 related to the performance of the Republic Bank and \nCitizens Bank in Wayne County and the six-county Detroit Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area \n(“PMSA”).  Based on the information gathered in its examination, the Board concluded that \nthere was reason to believe that Citizens Bank engaged in a pattern or practice of redlining in \nviolation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.  On April 19, 2010, the \nBoard referred this matter to the United States pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(g).  See Complaint, \n¶¶7-8.  \nB.  The United States’ Investigation and Complaint  \nThe United States conducted an investigation of Citizens Bank, including evaluation of \nextensive information regarding the bank’s home mortgage lending practices over time and \nstatistical analyses that compared Republic Bank’s and Citizens Bank’s pattern of lending \nactivity to other area lenders.  The United States determined that, in operating and expanding the \nscope of its business over time, Citizens Bank, and Republic Bank before it, served the credit \nneeds of residents of the majority-white residential census tracts (defined as those with a \npopulation greater than 50% white) of the Detroit Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area \n(“CMSA”), especially in the Detroit PMSA, to a significantly greater extent than it has served \nthe similar credit needs of majority African-American census tracts.  See id. at ¶¶29-30, 36-37. \nCRBC bears liability for the redlining practices of the prior Republic Bank.  In April \n2007, the Board approved Citizens Banking Corporation’s application to acquire Michigan-based \n3 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 6 of 21    Pg ID 40\nRepublic Bancorp Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Republic Bank.2  Pursuant to the merger \nagreement between the parties, Republic Bank merged “with and into” Citizens Banking \nCorporation, which continued as the surviving company.3  Thus, under Michigan’s traditional \nmerger principles,4 CRBC bears liability as the acquirer of Republic Bank.5  See D.F. Broderick \n                                                            \n2  Notice, 71 Fed. Reg. 54, 991 (September 20, 2006).  Citizens Banking Corporation, Flint, \nMichigan – Order Approving the Acquisition of a Bank Holding Company, Federal Reserve \nBulletin, Volume 93 (2007).   \n3  See Citizens Banking Corporation, Proxy and Proposed Prospectus (filed October 26, 2006), \navailable at:  \nhttp://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/351077/000095012406006154/k08054b3e424b3.htm. \nThe merger was structured and approved using the “purchase method of accounting,” with \nCitizens Banking Corporation treated as the acquirer.  Id.  \n4  The Sixth Circuit applies a state’s law on corporations when determining issues of successor \nliability.  See, e.g., City Mgmt. Corp. v. U.S. Chem. Co., Inc., 43 F.3d 244, 250 (6th Cir. 1994).  \nHowever, CRBC would also likely be held liable for Republic Bank’s discriminatory practices \nunder federal common law principles.  See Kennedy v. City of Zanesville, Oh., 505 F. Supp. 2d \n456, 478 (S.D. Ohio 2007) (holding a municipality liable for discrimination under the FHA in the \nprovision of public services by a previously independent utility it had purchased, under a de facto \nmerger theory); see also Golden State Bottling Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 414 U.S. 168, 171-174 (1973) \n(upholding the NLRB’s order requiring a successor company to reinstate with back pay an \nemployee discharged by the predecessor company, after noting that the successor acquired the \npredecessor with notice of unfair labor practice litigation and continued the business without \nsubstantial interruption or change in operations, employee, or supervisory personnel); EEOC v. \nMacMillan Bloedel Containers, Inc., 503 F.2d 1086, 1091 (6th Cir. 1974) (stating that it is \nappropriate to impose successor liability in cases of discrimination where equitable concerns \nfavor a successor’s liability). \n5  The United States has previously asserted in a redlining case in the Eastern District of \nMichigan that a successor corporation is liable for the discriminatory acts of its predecessor.  \nUnited States v. Old Kent Financial Corp. & Old Kent Bank, 2004 WL 1157779, No. 04-71879 \n(E.D. Mich.) (Settlement Agreement entered May 19, 2004).  In Old Kent, the complaint named \nthe two defendants “through their Successors in Interest.”  There, the “Old Kents” had been \nacquired by Fifth Third Bank pursuant to a merger agreement under which they “merged with \nand into” Fifth Third through a stock purchase agreement, with Fifth Third being the surviving \ncorporation.  The merger was structured and approved as a “pooling of interests” under generally \n4 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 7 of 21    Pg ID 41\nv. Cont’l Credit Corp., 309 Mich. 546, 550 (1944) (holding that if two corporations merge, the \nobligations of each become the obligations of the resulting corporation).  The United States’ \nComplaint also alleges that Citizens Bank is liable for its own redlining practices conducted after \nthe merger with Republic Bank.  See Complaint at ¶¶20, Exhibit C (Citizens Bank’s post-merger \nsoutheast Michigan plans did not include Wayne County), 21-23 (branching), 26-27 (assessment \narea pursuant to Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2901-2906), 28 \n(advertising and outreach), 33-35 (statistical analyses of Citizens Bank’s residential mortgage \nlending activity). \nAfter the United States notified the bank of its authorized lawsuit, the parties entered into \npre-suit negotiations, the product of which is the proposed Agreed Order for which the United \nStates now seeks entry.  \nC.  The Court’s Review of Consent Decrees \nIn reviewing a consent decree, the Court need only determine that the settlement is fair, \nadequate, and reasonable.6  Williams, 720 F.2d at 921; Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp. v. Village of \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \naccepted accounting principles, whereby the assets and liabilities of both corporations are \ncombined.  Fifth Third was not named in the caption of the case.  \n6  In contrast, courts generally scrutinize consent decrees more searchingly in the context of class \naction settlements.  See generally Int’l Union v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 628 (6th Cir. \n2007).  In such cases, a primary concern is the possibility of collusion between the defendant and \nclass counsel, whose interests may run counter to that of the represented class.  See id. (noting \nthe potential for collusiveness but holding that the class representatives must be afforded the \nnormal presumption that they handled their responsibilities independently and zealously).  No \nsuch potential conflict of interest exists in FHA suits brought by the Attorney General.  United \nStates v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1332 n.18 (5th Cir. 1980) (“Unlike . . . class actions \nlitigation, [w]hen the Department of Justice advocates a settlement, we need not fear that its \npecuniary interests will tempt it to agree to a settlement unfair to represented persons.”).  In any \n5 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 8 of 21    Pg ID 42\nArlington Heights, 616 F.2d 1006, 1014 (7th Cir. 1980); see also Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr. v. \nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 94 Ohio Misc. 2d 186, 188 (Ohio Com. Pl. 1998).  In Toledo Fair \nHous. Ctr., the court held that the redlining settlement negotiated between the parties, which \nrequired Nationwide to make affirmative efforts to increase its presence in predominantly \nAfrican-American neighborhoods in Toledo and included provisions for employee training, \ntargeted advertising, and a loan subsidy fund for community reinvestment, was fair and \nreasonable based in part on the presence of good faith of the parties and the recommendation and \nexperience of trial counsel.  Id. at 188-89, App’x A.   \nConsent decrees are the most favored means of resolving suits under the FHA.  See \nVillage of Arlington Heights, 616 F.2d at 1014 (“in this case under the Fair Housing Act national \npolicy . . . strongly favors settlement”); Jones v. Amalgamated Warbasse Houses, Inc., 97 F.R.D. \n355, 358-39 (E.D.N.Y. 1982) (“voluntary out of court settlement of disputes is highly favored in \nthe law, . . . particularly . . . in Fair Housing Act cases, where the alternative to voluntary \nagreement – a court-ordered injunction – may inhibit cooperation and voluntary compliance).  \nCf. Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 515 (1986) (“We have on numerous \noccasions recognized that Congress intended voluntary compliance to be the preferred means of \nachieving the objectives of Title VII”); Williams, 720 F.2d at 923 (“Voluntary settlement is the \npreferred method of eliminating employment discrimination . . . Congress has expressed a \n‘strong preference’ for encouraging voluntary settlement of Title VII actions.”); Huguley v. Gen. \nMotors Corp., 128 F.R.D. 81, 87 (E.D. Mich. 1989) (noting the overriding public interest in \nsettling and quieting litigation).  “Because of the consensual nature of the decree, voluntary \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nevent, even in class action settlements, courts generally favor and encourage the settlements of \nclass actions.  Franks v. Kroger Co., 649 F.2d 1216, 1224 (6th Cir. 1981).    \n6 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 9 of 21    Pg ID 43\ncompliance is rendered more likely,” and “[s]ettlements also contribute greatly to the efficient \nutilization of scarce federal judicial resources.”  Village of Arlington Heights, 616 F.2d at 1014 \nn.10.  \nConsistent with these principles, the United States seeks to resolve FHA and ECOA \ncases, such as this one, through consent decrees whenever possible.  See, e.g., United States v. \nAIG Fed. Sav. Bank and Wilmington Fin., Inc., No. CV-10-178 (D. Del.) (Consent Order filed \nMar. 19, 2010).  As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, \n681-81 (1981), “[c]onsent decrees are entered into by parties to a case after careful negotiation \nhas produced agreement on their precise terms.  The parties waive their right to litigate the issues \ninvolved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of \nlitigation.”  See also Blakely v. United States, 276 F.3d 853, 867-68 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting \nArmour). \n“The source of the court’s authority to require the parties to act [pursuant to a consent \njudgment] is the parties’ acquiescence, not rules of law.”  City of Warren v. City of Detroit, 495 \nF.3d 282, 287 (6th Cir. 2007).  Thus, a court’s review of a proposed consent decree is governed \nby its nature as a settlement.  As the Sixth Circuit has instructed, a consent decree is essentially \nan agreement between the parties and should be construed as a contract.  Blakely, 276 F.3d at \n867; see also United States v. IBM, 163 F.3d 737, 740 (2d Cir. 1998) (the court should make \n“only the minimal determination of whether the agreement is appropriate to be accorded the \nstatus of a judicially enforceable decree.”) (citation omitted).  In particular, in reviewing a \nproposed consent decree, “the court will not substitute its judgment for that of counsel,” Local \nNo. 93, 478 U.S. at 522, and “need not inquire into the precise rights of the parties nor reach and \nresolve the merits of the case or controversy,” Village of Arlington Heights, 616 F.2d at 1014.  \n7 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 10 of 21    Pg ID 44\nThe scope of a consent decree need not reference what “‘might have been written had the \nplaintiff established his factual claim and legal theories in litigation.’”  Firefighters Local Union \n1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 574 (1984), quoting Armour, 402 U.S. at 681-82.  Indeed, where, as \nhere, the agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations, “a decree is presumptively \nreasonable.”  Williams, 720 F.2d at 921; Bronson v. Bd. of Educ. of City Sch. Dist. of Cincinnati, \n604 F. Supp. 68, 71 (S.D. Ohio 1984).    \nConsent decrees entered in FHA cases may properly impose broad and diverse forms of \nrelief.  “[P]articularly in a fair housing situation, the existence of a federal statutory right implies \nthe existence of all measures necessary and appropriate to protect federal rights and implement \nfederal policies.”  Village of Arlington Heights, 616 F.2d at 1011.  “More importantly, it is the \nagreement of the parties, rather than the force of the law on which the complaint was originally \nbased, that creates the obligations embodied in a consent decree.”  Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 522.  \n“Therefore, a federal court is not necessarily barred from entering a consent decree merely \nbecause the decree provides broader relief than the court could have awarded after a trial.”  Id. at \n525; see also Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers’ Intern. Ass’n v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 482 (1986) \n(Title VII does not preclude district court from entering preferential relief benefiting individuals \nwho were not actual victims of discrimination); Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799, 809 (6th Cir. \n1986) (approving entry of a consent order that provided relief for individuals who were not the \nactual victims of defendant’s discriminatory practices).   \nIII.  THE COURT SHOULD ENTER THE PROPOSED AGREED ORDER  \nThe proposed Agreed Order is structured to provide an effective remedy commensurate \nwith the scope of the damage caused by the alleged redlining of the majority African-American \ncensus tracts in the Detroit CMSA, while recognizing the depressed economic conditions in \n8 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 11 of 21    Pg ID 45\nDetroit and the bank’s current status.7  The proposed Agreed Order commits the bank to the \nnondiscriminatory provision of residential banking and lending services in a market area that \ndoes not reflect the discriminatory exclusion of particular census tracts and also contains \nrequirements designed to fulfill that commitment, to invest in the previously redlined areas to \ncompensate for the past failure to provide equal loan services, and to provide targeted assistance \nto the local community.  The proposed Agreed Order makes clear that Citizens Bank is not \nrequired under the Order to alter its standards for underwriting a mortgage loan or conduct \nlending practices that the bank considers unsafe or unsound.  Proposed Agreed Order at ¶31.  \nInstead, the proposed Agreed Order seeks to increase the bank’s residential mortgage lending to \nqualified, eligible applicants in the Detroit metropolitan area.  Id. at ¶¶29-30.   \nMany of the components of the proposed Agreed Order, which are each described in \ndetail below, are similar to those the United States has included in settlements of fair lending \ncases alleging redlining brought in the past several years against banks, including in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan.  Old Kent, 2004 WL 1157779, No. 04-71879; United States v. First United \nSecurity Bank, No. 09-0644 (S.D. Ala.) (Agreed Order for Resolution entered Nov. 18, 2009); \nUnited States v. Centier Bank, No. 2:06-CV-344 (N.D. Ind.) (Consent Order entered Oct. 16, \n2006); United States v. First American Bank, No. 04C 4585 (N.D. Ill.) (Consent Order entered \n                                                            \n7  The Complaint notes the bank’s specific practices that served to avoid Wayne County and the \nCity of Detroit.  Complaint at ¶¶20-23, 25, 27-28.  The proposed Agreed Order is intended to \nremedy the bank’s alleged redlining practices in all majority African-American census tracts in \nthe Wayne County, although some provisions, such as the partnership with the City of Detroit, \npertain specifically to the City.  Based on data from the 2000 Census, 93.2% of the majority \nAfrican-American census tracts in Wayne County are located in the City of Detroit.  See Census \n2000 Summary File 1 (SF 1) 100-Percent Data. \n9 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 12 of 21    Pg ID 46\nJuly 19, 2004).8  In Old Kent, the United States’ lawsuit alleged that Old Kent Financial \nCorporation and Old Kent Bank, subsequently acquired by Fifth Third Bancorp, engaged in a \npattern of discrimination on the basis of race by unlawfully avoiding and refusing to provide \ntheir business and residential lending products and services to Detroit’s predominantly African-\nAmerican minority neighborhoods in violation of the FHA and ECOA.  The parties agreed to \nsettle the lawsuit through a judicially-enforceable settlement agreement, which included many of \nthe same components as the proposed Agreed Order, including:  a general injunction against \ndiscrimination, a loan subsidy fund in the amount of $3 million, three new full-service branches \nin the City of Detroit, a team of lenders specifically assigned to the City of Detroit, fair lending \ntraining, a targeted advertising program, and consumer education.   \nA.  General Prohibitory Injunction \nAs with past redlining cases brought by the United States, the proposed Agreed Order \nincludes a general injunction that prohibits Citizens Bank from engaging in any act or practice \nthat discriminates on the basis of race or color in any aspect of a residential real estate-related \ntransaction in violation of the FHA and ECOA.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶¶1-4.  This \nprovision ensures that moving forward, Citizens Bank will comply with the FHA and ECOA and \ntheir respective implementing regulations, which prohibit financial institutions from \ndiscriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race and color in their mortgage lending practices.  This \nprovision is standard in redlining settlement agreements.  See Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr., 94 Ohio \nMisc. 2d at 189, App’x A (approving redlining settlement that included general prohibitory \ninjunction against discrimination).   \n                                                            \n8  The redlining consent decrees filed by the United States are available online at \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/caselist.php.  \n10 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 13 of 21    Pg ID 47\nB.  CRA Assessment Area \nAs a depository bank, Citizens Bank is subject to the requirements of CRA and its \nenabling regulations promulgated by the Board, Regulation BB, 12 C.F.R. § 228 (Reg. BB).  \nThus, Citizens Bank has a “continuing affirmative obligation . . . to help meet the credit needs of \nthe local communit[y] in which [it is] chartered.”  12 U.S.C. § 2901(a)(3).  Specifically, the CRA \nand Reg. BB require most banks to delineate one or more assessment areas for federal regulators \nto use in evaluating whether the institution is meeting the credit needs of its entire community, \nthe CRA’s primary statutory purpose.  Under Reg. BB, a bank’s assessment area may not reflect \nillegal discrimination, taking into account its size and financial condition.  See 12 C.F.R. \n§ 228.41(e). \nFollowing the merger with Republic Bank, Citizens Bank adopted Republic Bank’s CRA \nassessment areas in southeast Michigan, which the Complaint alleges formed a virtual horseshoe \naround and excluded most of the majority-black census tracts in the City of Detroit.  Complaint \nat ¶25.  Citizens Bank did not provide a final assessment area that included all of the City of \nDetroit and all of Wayne County to Federal Reserve System staff until 2010.  Id. at 27.  In order \nto ensure the bank’s compliance with the CRA, the Agreed Order provides that Citizens Bank \nwill continue to include the entirety of Wayne County and the City of Detroit in its CRA \nassessment area during the term of this Order.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶5.   \nC.  Fair Lending Training \n  The proposed Agreed Order provides that the bank will continue to provide periodic \ntraining to all employees with significant involvement in residential lending to ensure that its \nactivities are conducted in a nondiscriminatory manner.  This training will encompass the bank’s \n11 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 14 of 21    Pg ID 48\nfair lending obligations under the FHA, ECOA, obligations under the CRA, and responsibilities \nunder the proposed Agreed Order.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶6.  \nFair lending training of defendants’ employees has been a component in all of the United \nStates’ recent redlining settlements and has been approved in the Sixth Circuit.  See, e.g., United \nStates v. City of Parma, 661 F.2d 562, 577 (6th Cir. 1981) (“It is common in [FHA] pattern or \npractice suits against private defendants to require educational programs for employees and \nadvertising programs to advise the public of the nondiscriminatory policies which will be \nfollowed.”); see also Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr., 94 Ohio Misc. 2d at 189, App’x A (approving \nredlining settlement requiring fair housing training of Nationwide employees).   \nD.  Partnership with City of Detroit \nCitizens Bank and the City of Detroit have agreed to a partnership in which the bank will \nassist the City’s efforts to promote sustained home ownership by providing grant funds to \nstabilize and revitalize neighborhoods.  Citizens Bank will devote $1.625 million to this grant \nprogram, which will be available to residents of neighborhoods identified by the City as part of \nProject 14 and the Detroit Works Project.  Under the program, the bank has agreed to provide \nexisting homeowners in targeted neighborhoods in the City of Detroit with a matching grant of \nup to $5,000 for exterior improvements for projects of $10,000 or more.  These improvements \ninclude a wide range of beautification, weatherization and restoration projects.  See proposed \nAgreed Order at ¶¶7-13.  \nThe United States’ Complaint alleges that Citizens Bank engaged in pattern of redlining \nthroughout its expansion and growth efforts, particularly through its acquisition of Republic \nBank.  Complaint at ¶¶21, 33, 37.  In light of the declining economic state of the area throughout \nthe period from 2004-2009, the effect of Citizens Bank’s and Republic Bank’s redlining in the \n12 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 15 of 21    Pg ID 49\nDetroit CMSA, especially in Wayne County, is not easily quantifiable; however, this area is \nseverely under-served in its banking and homeownership needs.  The bank’s partnership with the \nCity of Detroit is intended to assist in remedying the effects of the bank’s redlining practices and \nallow the bank to increase its physical presence in the City of Detroit, while accounting for the \nfeasibility of branch expansion by the bank, the economy in the Detroit metropolitan area, and \nthe need for community stabilization.   \nE.  Credit Needs Assessment \n  Under the proposed Agreed Order, the bank will take into account the most recently \navailable credit needs assessments conducted by the City of Detroit and other community-based \norganizations when implementing the terms of the proposed Agreed Order.  Significantly, the \ncredit needs assessments will assist the bank in increasing its residential mortgage lending in \nmajority African-American areas in Wayne County in a safe and sound manner.  See proposed \nAgreed Order at ¶14.  This type of provision is standard in redlining settlements filed by the \nUnited States.  See, e.g., First United Security Bank, No. 09-0644 (Agreed Order requiring bank \nto conduct credit needs assessment of majority African-American census tracts in west central \nAlabama within three months of entry of the agreement); Centier, No. 2:06-CV-344 (Consent \nOrder required bank to begin an assessment of the residential real-estate related and small \nbusiness credit needs of the Gary, Indiana-area’s majority-minority census tracts within two \nmonths of entry of the Order); First American Bank, No. 04C 4585 (Consent Order required the \nbank to undertake actions to assess its progress in meeting the goals of the Order and other \nmeasures the bank had instituted to meet the credit needs of minority communities in the \nChicago and Kankakee MSAs on or before the second anniversary of the entry of the Order). \n \n13 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 16 of 21    Pg ID 50\nF.  Community Development Lenders \n  The proposed Agreed Order further provides that Citizens Bank will employ two \nCommunity Development Lenders to focus primarily on generating residential mortgage loans in \nthe majority-black census tracts within Wayne County, as well as facilitating the bank’s grant \nprograms.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶15.  These Community Development Lenders will \nassist the bank in meeting the goals of the proposed Agreed Order and have been included in past \nredlining settlements brought by the United States and private plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Toledo Fair \nHous. Ctr., 94 Ohio Misc. 2d at 189, App’x A (approving redlining settlement that required \nNationwide to place an insurance agent in an area of Toledo with a significant African-American \npresence).   \nG.  Physical Expansion in Wayne County \n  The Complaint alleges that Citizens Bank’s residential lending in Michigan has been \ngenerated primarily by the activities conducted within its branch offices.  Complaint at ¶14.  \nThus, a key component of the overall remedial undertaking is increasing Citizens Bank’s \nphysical presence in the redlined tracts as the bank has increased its presence in majority-white \nareas of southeast Michigan – a visible sign to those areas that the bank is a readily available \nsource for lending products and services.  However, additional branch locations are not feasible \nat this time, proposed Agreed Order at ¶16, and thus the proposed Agreed Order provides that the \nbank will open a Loan Production Office (“LPO”) in a majority African-American area in the \nCity of Detroit within ninety days of entry of the Order.  The LPO will focus on the marketing \nand intake of residential mortgage loan applications from residents of the majority African-\nAmerican census tracts in Wayne County and grant applications for the partnership program, and \nwill provide the base of operation for the Community Development Lenders.  Under the \n14 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 17 of 21    Pg ID 51\nproposed Agreed Order, Citizens Bank will continue to evaluate the feasibility of branch \nexpansion in the majority African-American census tracts of Wayne County and will report to \nthe United States on the feasibility of converting the LPO into a full-service branch or opening a \nbranch in another location in a majority African-American census tract of Wayne County.  See \nproposed Agreed Order at ¶¶16-21.  \nH.  Advertising and Consumer Education \nUnder the proposed Agreed Order, Citizens Bank will enhance and continue its current \nplan for targeted advertising and marketing to majority African-American residential areas of \nWayne County.  The bank’s program will include some of all of the following:  (a) print media \nspecifically directed to African-American readers; (b) radio advertisements on African-\nAmerican-oriented Detroit-area stations; (c) point-of-distribution materials targeted toward the \nmajority African-American census tracts in Wayne County to advertise the bank’s products and \nservices; and (d) direct mailings.  Citizens Bank will also provide a minimum of four outreach \nprograms per year for real estate brokers and agents, developers, and public or private entities \ndoing business in the majority-black census tracts in Wayne County.  Further, the bank will \nprovide credit counseling, financial literacy, and other related educational programs to residents \nin the majority African-American census tracts, to help identify and develop qualified loan \nand/or grant applicants from these areas.  This program will include a minimum of six outreach \nseminars each year targeted towards residents of majority African-American census tracts in \nWayne County.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶¶22-25.  \nThe United States’ previous redlining consent orders have included provisions relating to \nadvertising, marketing, and consumer education, as a means to engage the residents of the \nredlined areas and to increase financial and credit literacy in redlined communities.  The \n15 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 18 of 21    Pg ID 52\nhistorical lack of full and open competition in the banking sector has resulted in the absence of \nmainstream financial institutions from, and the increased presence of non-traditional financial \ninstitutions in, segregated minority communities.  The advertising and consumer education plan \ndescribed in the proposed Agreed Order will enable the bank to reach the African-American \ncommunity and assist it in increasing its residential mortgage lending to this community.  These \ntypes of programs have been accepted as fair and reasonable in other FHA and redlining suits.  \nSee City of Parma, 661 F.2d at 577 (acknowledging that advertising programs are a common \ncomponent in FHA pattern or practice suits against private defendants); Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr., \n94 Ohio Misc. 2d at 189, App’x A (approving redlining settlement that included targeted \nadvertising program). \nI.  Program for Loan Subsidies \nThe proposed Agreed Order provides that Citizens Bank will invest a minim um of $1.5 \nmillion in a special program to increase the residential mortgage credit that the bank extends to \nresidents of majority African-American census tracts of Wayne County.  This “special financing \nprogram” will offer res idents in majority-black census tracts in W ayne County, regardless of \nrace, loan products at interest rates and/or on terms that are more advantageous to the applicant \nthan Citizens Bank would norm ally provide, such as an intere st rate subsidy, down paym ent \nassistance, or closing cost assistance.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶¶26-32.  This type of  \nprogram has been a central elem ent in redlining settlements brought by the United States and \nprivate  plaintiffs and is especially   significant  given  that there are no  individual,  identified \n“victims” in most redlining cases.  See, e.g., Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr., 94 Ohio Misc. 2d at 189, \nApp’x A (approving redlining settlem ent that included loan subsidy fund in the form  of, inter \nalia, down payment and closing cost assistance  for low and m oderate income home buyers \n16 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 19 of 21    Pg ID 53\nseeking  to purchase and/or repa ir  single-family  homes  in predom inantly  African-American \nneighborhoods in Toledo).  The loan subsidy program in the proposed Agreed Order is intended \nto compensate the African-American community in Wayne County at large for the bank’s prior \nredlining practices.  As stated above, the proposed Agreed Order makes clear that Citizens Bank \nis  not required to alter its st andards  for underwriting a mortga ge  loan or c onduct  lending \npractices that the bank considers unsafe or unsound.  See proposed Agreed Order at ¶31.  \nJ.  Duration of the Proposed Agreed Order \nThe proposed Agreed Order includes typical record retention and periodic reporting \nprovisions with respect to compliance-related information and documents, see proposed Agreed \nOrder at ¶¶33-36, as well as a term of five years, all of which are typical in fair lending cases \nbrought by the United States.  Id. at ¶37.  The five-year term will allow time for the proposed \nchanges in the bank’s business practices and the community stabilization of Detroit to take full \neffect.  However, the proposed Agreed Order provides that if Citizens Bank meets its investment \nrequirements within four years, the parties will jointly move this Court to terminate the Order at \nthat time.  Id.  \n  Courts typically retain jurisdiction for a number of years to ensure compliance with \nconsent decrees.  Most such orders have durations of between one and five years, with their \nlength being affected by factors such as the nature and seriousness of the violation, and whether \nthe lawsuit involved a single incident or a pattern of conduct.  United States v. DiMucci, 879 \nF.2d 1488, 1493 (7th Cir. 1989) (record keeping and reporting requirements for three years); \nUnited States v. West Peachtree Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 231 (5th Cir. 1971) (record keeping and \nreporting requirements for two years); Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr., 94 Ohio Misc. 2d at 189 \n(approving four-year term for redlining settlement).  Several redlining settlements brought by the \n17 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 6   Filed 05/17/11   Pg 20 of 21    Pg ID 54\nUnited States have five-year terms.  See, e.g., Centier Bank, No. 2:06-CV-344; First American \nBank, No. 04C 4585.  As described above, the Court’s continuing jurisdiction for five years is \nnecessary to ensure compliance with the Order. \nIV.

This action is brought by the United States to enforce the provisions of the Fair \nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§§ 1691-1691f. \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1345, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3614, and 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(h).  Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n3.  Defendant Citizens Republic Bancorp, Inc. (“CRBC”) is a bank holding company \nheadquartered in Flint, Michigan.  CRBC offers the traditional services of a financial depository \nand lending institution, including the receipt of monetary deposits and the financing of \nresidential housing and commercial loans.  As of June 30, 2009, CRBC had assets totaling just \n \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 2 of 14    Pg ID 2\nover $12.3 billion.  CRBC is subject to the regulatory authority of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System (“Board”). \n4.  CRBC’s largest operation is within the State of Michigan where it operates \nthrough its subsidiary, defendant Citizens Bank.  Citizens Bank has 156 branches in Michigan, \n36 of which are in the southeast part of the state. \n5.  CRBC previously conducted business under the name Citizens Banking \nCorporation.  In September 2006, Citizens Banking Corporation applied to the Board to acquire \nMichigan-based Republic Bancorp Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Republic Bank.  As of \nSeptember 30, 2005, Republic Bank had assets totaling $6.1 billion.  On April 26, 2007, CRBC \nchanged its name after the Board approved its acquisition of Republic Bancorp Inc. and Republic \nBank.   \n6.  CRBC and Citizens Bank (collectively, “defendants”) are subject to the federal \nlaws governing fair lending, including the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity \nAct and their respective implementing regulations, the fair housing regulations of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. § 100.1, et seq., and Regulation B of \nthe Board, 12 C.F.R. § 202.1, et seq.  The Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity \nAct prohibit financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race and color in \ntheir mortgage lending practices.  \n7.  During 2007, Federal Reserve System bank examiners initiated a fair lending \nexamination of Citizens Bank for possible redlining activity.  The examination included an \nevaluation of lending data from 2006-2008 related to the performance of the prior Republic Bank \nand Citizens Bank in Wayne County and the six-county Detroit Primary Metropolitan Statistical \nArea (“PMSA”).  Based on the information gathered in its examination, the Board concluded that \n2 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 3 of 14    Pg ID 3\nthere was reason to believe that Citizens Bank engaged in a pattern or practice of redlining in \nviolation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.   \n8.  Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(g), the Board referred the matter to the Attorney \nGeneral for appropriate enforcement action on April 19, 2010, following its determination as \ndescribed in paragraph 7.   \n9.  The Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (“Detroit \nCMSA”) consists of three PMSAs:  the Detroit PMSA (Lapeer, St. Clair, Oakland, Macomb, \nWayne, and Monroe counties), the Flint PMSA (Genesee county), and the Ann Arbor PMSA \n(Lenawee, Livingston, and Washtenaw counties).  See Map attached as Exhibit A.   \n10.  According to the 2000 Census, the Detroit CMSA had a total population of \napproximately 5.46 million persons, of whom 72% were non-Hispanic white (approximately 3.9 \nmillion) and 21% were African-American (approximately 1.14 million).  Nearly 70% (775,772) \nof the CMSA’s African-American population lived in the City of Detroit. \n11.  Within the Detroit CMSA, the Detroit and Flint PMSAs have long had highly \nsegregated residential housing patterns, especially for African-Americans.  In 2006, the U.S. \nCensus Bureau compiled data reflecting the extent of residential segregation in approximately \n330 metropolitan areas across the United States, based on data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 \ndecennial censuses.  Based on a measure called the dissimilarity index,1 the Detroit PMSA was \nthe most highly segregated metropolitan area in the country for African-Americans in 2000, the \n                                                           \n1  Residential segregation can be measured by several indices; the most-widely used measure is \ncalled the dissimilarity index.  Dissimilarity, which ranges from 0 (complete integration) to 1 \n(complete segregation), measures the percentage of a group’s population that would have to \nchange residences for each neighborhood to have the same percent of that group as the \nmetropolitan area overall.   \n3 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 4 of 14    Pg ID 4\nsecond most highly segregated area in 1990, and the fourth most highly segregated area in 1980.  \nThe Flint PMSA ranked ninth in 1990 and 2000 and sixth in 1980.  The Ann Arbor PMSA had \nthe lowest levels of segregation among the three PMSAs in the Detroit CMSA, yet the data show \nthat the Ann Arbor PMSA has become more segregated over time:  it ranked 177th in 1980, \n115th in 1990, and 70th in 2000. \n12.  A 2008 Census Bureau study compared the level of segregation in 1980, 1990, \nand 2000 for 43 large metropolitan areas with a population of one million or more in 1980 and at \nleast 3% or 20,000 African-American residents.  That study found that, based on the dissimilarity \nindex, the Detroit PMSA was the second most highly segregated large metropolitan area in the \ncountry for African-Americans in 1980 and the most highly segregated in 1990 and 2000. \n13.  In operating and expanding the scope of their business over time, defendants have \nacted to meet the credit needs for residential real estate-related loans in the predominantly white \nresidential census tracts (with a population greater than 50% white) of the Detroit CMSA, \nespecially in the Detroit PMSA, and have avoided serving the similar credit needs of majority-\nblack census tracts.   \n14.  Over time, defendants have expanded their lending operations to substantial \nportions of the Detroit metropolitan area.  A major component of defendants’ expansion has been \nthe construction or acquisition of additional branch offices, which are designed both to better \nserve existing customers and to attract new customers for defendants’ services and products.   \n15.  Defendants have engaged in a race-based pattern of locating or acquiring branch \noffices.  They have located or acquired branch offices in a manner designed to serve the banking \nand credit needs of the residents of majority-white census tracts, but not those of residents of \nmajority-black census tracts. \n4 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 5 of 14    Pg ID 5\n16.  Beginning in 1993, Citizens Bank started expanding south from its headquarters \nin Flint.  Citizens Bank acquired eight branches in Oakland County in 1993 and four branches in \nGenesee, Washtenaw, St. Joseph, and Lansing counties in 1995.  In 1997, Citizens Bank opened \na branch in western Wayne County, located in Livonia, Michigan (“Livonia Branch”). \n17.  In June 2003, Citizens Bank’s board of directors identified the Detroit PMSA as \none of three major Midwest markets with above average density and above average growth \nforecasts, finding that Detroit, Des Moines, and Milwaukee comprised roughly 50% more market \ndemand for banking/financial service products and services than the 30 other PMSAs and rural \nmarkets in which Citizens operated combined.  Despite this, Citizens Bank’s expansion in the \nDetroit PMSA between 2003 and 2006 was limited to Oakland County, where it opened fourteen \nnew branches.  As of 2006, all of the branches located in Oakland County were located in \nmajority-white census tracts, except for the Southfield branch, which is located in a census tract \nwith a 50-75% African-American population.2  In late 2005, Citizens Bank opened one branch \non the border between Wayne County and Oakland County in a majority-white census tract at \nEight Mile Road and Haggerty (“Eight Mile and Haggerty Branch”).   \n18.  CRBC’s acquisition of Republic Bancorp Inc. and Republic Bank in 2007 further \nexpanded defendants’ lending operations, particularly expanding their residential real estate-\nrelated lending business.  When CRBC acquired Republic Bank, Citizens Bank and Republic \nBank were of comparable size with complementary geographic footprints.  See Map attached as \nExhibit B.  However, Citizens Bank previously had focused more on business and commercial \n                                                           \n2  All references to the demographic composition of a census tract are based on data from the \n2000 Census.  \n5 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 6 of 14    Pg ID 6\nloans than residential loans, while Republic Bank’s primary lending focus was residential \nlending.   \n19.  At the time of the acquisition, Republic Bank had four branch locations in Wayne \nCounty, in Northville, Plymouth, Canton, and Grosse Pointe Woods.  All four of these branches \nwere in located in majority-white census tracts outside of the City of Detroit.  Citizens Bank had \none branch location in Wayne County at the time of the merger (the Livonia Branch) and one \nbranch location on the border between Wayne County and Oakland County (the Eight Mile and \nHaggerty Branch).  These branches were also located in majority-white census tracts outside of \nthe City of Detroit.   \n20.  On November 6, 2006, Citizens Bank filed a document with the U.S. Securities \nand Exchange Commission entitled “Mid-Atlantic Super Community Bank Conference” that set \nout, inter alia, the strategic rationale for the merger.  In the document, Citizens Bank claimed \nthat the merger would create a “more attractive southeast Michigan presence.”  See Exhibit C.  \nThe document identified Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, and Washtenaw counties as the selected \nsoutheastern Michigan counties in which Citizens Bank planned to have a post-merger presence.  \nSee id.  Citizens Bank did not identify Wayne County as one of its selected counties in the \ndocument.  See id.   \n21.  Following the merger, Citizens Bank decreased its presence in Wayne County by \nclosing the Livonia Branch and consolidating the Eight Mile and Haggerty Branch with Republic \nBank’s Northville Branch.  All of Citizens Bank’s post-merger branch locations in Michigan are \noutside the City of Detroit and, with the exception of its Flint branches, are located in majority-\nwhite census tracts.  In addition to its branches, as of August 2008, Citizens Bank had one \n6 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 7 of 14    Pg ID 7\nmortgage loan officer located in Canton, a majority-white census tract in western Wayne County, \napproximately 30 miles from Detroit.  See Map attached as Exhibit D.   \n22.  The only presence Citizens Bank has ever had within the City of Detroit is one \ncash-dispensing (not full service) ATM, located at the Detroit Science Center.  The ATM opened \non February 3, 2009, well after the Board started its fair lending examination of Citizens Bank on \nSeptember 17, 2007.   \n23.  CRBC currently operates nine Citizens Bank branches within twenty miles of \nDetroit.  All of these branches are located in majority-white census tracts, except for the \nSouthfield branch in Oakland County, which is located in a tract with a 50-75% African-\nAmerican population.  See Map attached as Exhibit E.   \n24.  Pursuant to the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the Board has \npromulgated regulations to implement the CRA, 12 C.F.R. § 228 (“Reg. BB”).  Under Reg. BB, \nas amended in 1997, a bank’s assessment area ordinarily will consist of one or more metropolitan \nareas or contiguous political subdivisions, 12 C.F.R. § 228.41(c), unless that area would be \nextremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers, 12 \nC.F.R. § 228.41(d).  Reg. BB further provides that if a bank’s assessment area does not include \nentire political jurisdictions, its assessment area may not reflect illegal discrimination.  12 C.F.R. \n§ 228.41(e). \n25.  In 2005 and 2006, Republic Bank delineated fourteen assessment areas, including \nall or parts of the following counties within the Detroit CMSA:  Genesee (all); Livingston (all); \nOakland (all); Macomb (all); Washtenaw (all); Monroe (all); and Wayne (northwestern and far \neastern portion).  Republic Bank’s assessment areas formed a virtual horseshoe around and \nexcluded most majority-black census tracts in the City of Detroit.  See Map attached as Exhibit \n7 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 8 of 14    Pg ID 8\nF.  Specifically, Republic Bank’s 2005 and 2006 CRA assessment areas excluded 250 of the 311 \nmajority-black census tracts within the City of Detroit.  In its 2005 CRA Performance \nEvaluation, Republic Bank received an overall “Needs To Improve” rating based on the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation’s finding of a substantive violation of anti-discrimination laws \n(including Fair Housing and Equal Credit Opportunity) in the bank’s 1-4 family, mortgage loan \nportfolio.   \n26.  In 2006, before the merger with Republic Bank, Citizens Bank’s delineated \nassessment area within the Detroit CMSA included all or parts of the following counties:  \nGenessee (all), Oakland (all), Macomb (small southern portion), Washtenaw (eastern portion), \nand Wayne (small western portion).  Citizens Bank’s 2006 assessment area did not include any \nportion of the City of Detroit.  See Map attached as Exhibit G.   \n27.  In 2007, following the merger with Republic Bank, Citizens Bank adopted the \nsame CRA assessment areas within the Detroit CMSA that Republic Bank used in 2005 and \n2006.  See Map attached as Exhibit H.  Thus, most of the City of Detroit and Wayne County still \nfell outside of Citizens Bank’s assessment area.  Citizens Bank did not provide its final \nassessment area that included all of the City of Detroit and all of Wayne County to Federal \nReserve System staff until July 2010, well after the Board had informed Citizens Bank in March \n2009 that, in its view, Citizens Bank’s assessment area in Wayne County failed to comport with \nReg. BB and after the Department of Justice informed Citizens Bank of its redlining \ninvestigation in April 2009. \n28.  CRBC and Citizens Bank’s customer solicitation efforts also reflect the failure to \nserve predominantly black areas on an equal basis with predominantly white areas.  For example, \n8 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 9 of 14    Pg ID 9\nin 2006 and 2007, Citizens Bank did not conduct any print or radio advertising in Detroit.  Nor \ndid Citizens Bank engage in any outreach activities in the City of Detroit.     \n29.  The policies and practices of defendants, described herein, have served majority-\nwhite communities to a significantly greater extent than majority-black communities, as further \ndemonstrated by defendants’ actual residential lending activity over time. \n30.  Statistical analyses of Republic Bank’s residential real estate-related loan \napplications for 2004-2006 show that Republic Bank served the credit needs of the residents of \nmajority-white census tracts of the Detroit CMSA and Detroit PMSA to a significantly greater \nextent than it served the residential real estate-related credit needs of the residents of majority-\nblack neighborhoods.  Similarly, statistical analyses of Citizens Bank’s residential real estate-\nrelated loan applications for 2007-2008 demonstrate that after CRBC acquired Republic Bank in \n2006, Citizens Bank has served the credit needs of the residents of majority-white census tracts \nof the Detroit CMSA and Detroit PMSA to a significantly greater extent than it has served the \nresidential real estate-related credit needs of the residents of majority-black neighborhoods.  \n31.  From 2004-2006, Republic Bank generated 14,770 single-family (defined by the \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”) as dwellings with 1-4 units) residential loan \napplications in the Detroit CMSA that were required to be reported to its regulator pursuant to \nHMDA, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2810.  Only 395, or 2.7%, of these applications were received from \nmajority-black tracts.  During that same time period, comparable lenders in the Detroit CMSA \nreceived 7.5% of their residential real estate-related loan applications from majority-black census \ntracts.  These results show a statistically significant failure by Republic Bank to provide loan \nservices and draw applications from majority-black tracts.  See Maps attached as Exhibits I-J. \n9 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 10 of 14    Pg ID 10\n32.  Similarly, Republic Bank generated 8,860 single-family residential loan \napplications in the Detroit PMSA from 2004-2006 that were required to be reported pursuant to \nHMDA.  Only 263, or 2.9%, of these applications were received from majority-black tracts.  \nDuring that same time period, comparable lenders in the Detroit PMSA received 7.9% of their \nresidential real estate-related loan applications from majority-black census tracts.  These results \nalso show a statistically significant failure by Republic Bank to provide loan services and draw \napplications from majority-black tracts.   \n33.  Statistical analyses of Citizens Bank’s residential real estate-related loan \napplications demonstrate that after CRBC acquired Republic Bank, Citizens Bank began to serve \nthe credit needs of the residents of majority-white census tracts of the Detroit CMSA and Detroit \nPMSA to a significantly greater extent than it served the residential real estate-related credit \nneeds of the residents of majority-black neighborhoods.   \n34.  In 2007, Citizens Bank generated 2,591 single-family residential loan applications \nin the Detroit CMSA.  Only 142, or 5.5%, of these applications were received from majority-\nblack tracts.  During that same year, comparable lenders in the Detroit CMSA received 9.0% of \ntheir residential real estate-related loan applications from majority-black census tracts.  In 2008, \nthe shortfall was even greater as Citizens Bank generated 1,502 single-family residential loan \napplications in the Detroit CMSA.  Only 58, or 3.9%, of these applications were received from \nmajority-black tracts.  Comparable lenders received 11.4% of their residential real estate-related \nloan applications from majority-black census tracts in 2008.  Thus, post-merger, Citizens Bank \nfailed to draw the expected number of residential loan applications from the majority-black \ncensus tracts within the Detroit CMSA.  These shortfalls were statistically significant in both \n2007 and 2008.  See Maps attached as Exhibits K-L.   \n10 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 11 of 14    Pg ID 11\n35.  Similarly, in 2007, Citizens Bank generated 1,246 single-family residential loan \napplications in the Detroit PMSA.  Only 84, or 6.7%, of these applications were received from \nmajority-black tracts.  During that same year, comparable lenders in the Detroit PMSA received \n10.4% of their residential real estate-related loan applications from majority-black census tracts.  \nIn 2008, the shortfall was even greater as Citizens Bank generated 679 single-family residential \nloan applications in the Detroit PMSA.  Only 32, or 4.7%, of these applications were received \nfrom majority-black tracts.  Comparable lenders received 12.9% of their residential real estate-\nrelated loan applications from majority-black census tracts in 2008.  Post-merger, Citizens Bank \nalso failed to draw the expected number of residential loan applications from the majority-black \ncensus tracts within the Detroit PMSA.  These shortfalls were statistically significant in both \n2007 and 2008.  \n36.  The statistically significant disparities identified in the Detroit CMSA for both \nCitizens Bank and Republic Bank were primarily driven by the banks’ substantial disparities in \nthe proportion of loan applications obtained from majority African-American census tracts and \nmajority-white census tracts located in the Detroit PMSA and Wayne County.  These statistical \ndisparities result from the banks’ failure to provide services in the majority African-American \ncensus tracts of the City of Detroit.   \n37.  The totality of defendants’ policies and practices described in paragraphs 13-36 \nconstitutes the redlining of majority-black areas of the Detroit PMSA for defendants’ lending \nbusiness.  Defendants’ policies and practices are intended to deny and discourage, or have the \neffect of denying or discouraging, an equal opportunity to the residents of the majority-black \nneighborhoods of the Detroit PMSA, on account of the racial composition of those \n11 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 12 of 14    Pg ID 12\nneighborhoods, to obtain residential real estate-related loans.  These policies and practices are \nnot justified by business necessity or legitimate business considerations. \n38.  Defendants’ actions as alleged herein constitute: \na.  Discrimination on the basis of race or color in making available, or in the terms or \nconditions of residential real estate-related transactions, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3605(a); \nb.  The making unavailable or denial of dwellings to persons because of race or color \nin violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); \nc.  Discrimination on the basis of race or color in the terms, conditions, or privileges \nof the provision of services or facilities in connection with the sale or rental of dwellings, in \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b); and \nd.  Discrimination against applicants with respect to credit transactions, on the basis \nof race or color, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(1). \n39.  Defendants’ policies and practices as alleged herein constitute: \na.  A pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights secured by the \nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 1691e(h); and \nb.  A denial of rights granted by the Fair Housing Act to a group of persons that \nraises an issue of general public importance. \n40.  Persons who have been victims of defendants’ discriminatory policies and \npractices are aggrieved persons as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i) and as described in the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(e)(i), and have suffered damages as a result of \n12 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 13 of 14    Pg ID 13\ndefendants’ conduct in violation of both the Fair Housing and the Equal Credit Opportunity Acts, \nas described herein. \n41.  The discriminatory policies and practices of defendants have been intentional and \nwillful, and implemented with reckless disregard for the rights of African-American borrowers.    \nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that the Court enter an ORDER that: \n(1)  Declares that the policies and practices of defendants constitute a violation of the \nFair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act; \n(2)  Enjoins defendants, their agents, employees, and successors, and all other persons \nin active concert or participation with defendants, from: \n(A)  Discriminating on account of race or color in any aspect of their lending \nbusiness practices; \n(B)  Failing or refusing to take such affirmative steps as may be necessary to \nrestore, as nearly as practicable, the victims of defendants’ unlawful practices to the \nposition they would be in but for the discriminatory conduct;  \n(C)  Failing or refusing to take such affirmative steps as may be necessary to \nprevent the recurrence of any discriminatory conduct in the future and to eliminate, to the \nextent practicable, the effects of defendants’ unlawful practices, and providing policies \nand procedures to ensure all segments of defendants’ market areas are served without \nregard to prohibited characteristics; \n(3)  Awards monetary damages to all the victims of defendants’ discriminatory \npolicies and practices for the injuries caused by defendants, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3614(d)(1)(B) and 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(h); and \n13 \n \n\n2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM   Doc # 1   Filed 05/05/11   Pg 14 of 14    Pg ID 14\n(4)  Assesses a civil penalty against defendants in an amount authorized by 42 \nU.S.C. § 3614(d)(1)(C), in order to vindicate the public interest. \nThe United States further prays for such additional relief as the interests of justice may \nrequire. \n \nDated: May 5, 2011          Respectfully submitted, \n                    \n              ERIC HOLDER \n              Attorney General \n \n \n              ___s/Thomas E.

In reviewing the Agreed\nOrder, it (1) fails to define terms; (2) lacks completeness; (3) contains superfluous clauses; (4) lacks\nclarity; and (5) is void of provisions for the Cour t to effectively oversee the parties’ obligations\nunder the Agreed Order during its anticipated term.\n\nTo the extent that the Agreed Order contains terms that are not defined, the Court notes\nsuch terms at the following pages and paragraphs of the Agreed Order:1\n1.  Page 2, paragraph 2: use of the term s “majority - black census trac ts” and\n“majority-white consensus tract” without defining the num ber of tracts and each\n“tract” at issue in the Agreed Order;2\n2.  Page 2, paragraph 2: use of the term “targeted neighborhoods” without defining\nsuch neighborhoods, including the criteria used to target them, the manner in which\nthey are targeted, and the entity that declares them a “targeted neighborhood”;3\n3.  Page 5, paragraph 2: use of the term “CRA rating” without defining it;\n4.  Page 7, paragraph 3: use of the term “ensure” without defining Defendants’ duties\nand responsibilities to “ensure” that loan produc ts are available and marketed in\ncertain areas—i.e., does “ensure” mean guarantee?;\n5.  Page 8, paragraph 6: use of the term s “periodic training” and “independent\ncontractors” without defining them and, if the bank is required to hire them , who\nchooses the “independent contractors”; \n6.  Page 9, paragraph 8: refers to “Proejct 14 and the Detroit Works Project” without\nfurther defining them or incorporating them into this order;\n7.  Page 11, paragraph 14: refers to “other community-based organizations” without\nspecifically identifying each organization involved;\n8. Page 13, paragraph 19: use of the te rm “unreasonably” in the phrase “will not\nunreasonably [withhold]” approval without further defining “unreasonably”;\n9.  Page 13, paragraph 20: use of the term  “appropriate remedy” without further\ndefining it; \n1The parties submitted a 22-page Agreed Order without apparently being cognizant of the difficulty\nin reviewing a document of such length without simple numerical type-face located on each page.\nAs such, the Court has numbered its copy of the Agreed Order, marking the first page as page one\nand continuing until the final page, page 22.  Additionally, the Court’s Order references paragraph\nnumbers, which begin anew on each page at paragraph one, unless that paragraph already contains\nan identifying mark.\n2Among other paragraphs, this term is also used on page 12, paragraph 17.\n3This term is also used on page 9, paragraph 8.\n2\n\n10.  Page 14, paragraph 22: use of the term “targeted advertising” without further\ndefining it;\n11.  Page 14, paragraph 22.(a): use of the pharse “print medium specifically directed\nto African-American readers” without specifically identifying or defining such print\nmedium;\n12.  Page 14, paragraph 22.(b): use of the phrase “two African-American-oriented\nDetroit-area radio stations” without specifically identifying them, and use of the term\n“radio  advertisements”  without s pecifying  the length or content of such\nadvertisements;\n13.  Page 15, paragraph 22.(d): use of the term “existing customers” without further\ndefining it;\n14.  Page 16, paragraphs 26 and 27: use oft he terms “special program” and “special\nfinancial program” without clarifying if these terms refer to the same program or\ndefining one or both terms;\n15.  Page 16, paragraph 28: use of the term  “any qualified applicant” wi thout\ndefining or setting out any criteria to establish such an applicant;\n16.  Page 18, paragraph 33: refers to Defendants’ “partnership” with the Ci ty of\nDetroit without further expanding on it or defining it;\n17.  Page 18, paragraph 33: refers to “lending initiatives and outreach program s”\nwithout specifically identifying and defining them; \n18.  Page 19, paragraph 36: use of the term “objective assessment” without further\ndefining it, including who reviews such ana ssessment and the actions taken pursuant\nto a filed assessment; and\n19.  Page 20, paragraph 37: use of  the term “good cause shown” without f urther\ndefining it.\nTo the extent that the Agreed Order contains provisions that lack completeness, the Court\nnotes such provisions at the following pages and paragraphs of the Agreed Order:\n20.  Page 3, last paragraph: refers to a fair lending examination without explaining\nwhy  this exam ination  was initiated, including specif ically  delineating the\nperformance of Republic Bank from the performance of Defendants;\n3\n\n21.  Page 7, paragraph 2: use of the phrase “consistent with safe and sound banking\npractices” without additional provisions on how to arrive at safe and sound banking\npractices or which person or entity decides whether the actions are consistent with\nsuch practices;\n22.  Page 8, paragraph 6: refers t o “independent contractors” without addressing\nwhether such contractors are lim ited to those contractors hired by Defendants,\nassuming it is Defendants that have the right to choose the contractors;\n23.  Page 9, paragraph 7: refers to a pa rtnership with the City of Detroit without\naddressing if the partnership is in writing; if not in writing, then it should state why\nnot, and if in writing, then the terms must be included in the Agreed Order;4\n24.  Page 9, paragraph 8: refers to exterior im provements, yet, it does not include\ninterior improvements or explain why such improvements are ineligible, and states\nthat the City identifies the “availabl e residents of neighborhoods” in line one,\npresumably without consulting Defendants, bu tthen continues in line four to suggest\nthat  Defendants  and the City will id entify  “existing hom eowners  in targeted\nneighborhoods”;  further, are “residents”, as used in line one, and “existing\nhomeowners”, as used in line four, meant to reference the same persons?;\n25.  Page 9, paragraph 9: refers to thee xclusion of condominiums and cooperatives,\nyet fails to address why this type of housing has been identified as ineligible;\n26.  Pages 9 and 10, paragraph 10: refers toim  provements to the exterior of the home\nwithout any additional provisions requiring the recipient of the grant to maintain the\nimprovements, at a minimum, during the period that the Agreed Order is in effect,\nsuch as entering into enforceable agreements with the recipients or real property\ncovenants to maintain the improvements;\n27.  Page 10, paragraph 11: refers to the grant program  being administered by the\nCity of Detroit or its designated partner, yet fails to identify any designated partner\nin the Agreed Order.  In addition, the grant program is not specifically defined in the\nAgreed Order to eliminate any issues with respect to qualifications for eligibility,\nzoning issues, contractor approval, and other related issues.  Further, the Court notes\nthat the grant program’s structure must be delineated, including an anti-nepotism\nprovision, a provision for receiving contractor approval, and the person or persons\nresponsible for it;\n28.  Page 10, paragraph 12: refers to “preapproved projects” and “qualifying project\ncosts” without further detail, specifically with respect to owners undertaking their\n4The Court also notes that the second line of this paragraph has a typographical error.\n4\n\nown repairs;\n29.  Page 11, paragraph 15: refers to a “Community Development Lender” without\nclarifying whether this is an employee of Defendants;\n30.  Page 12, paragraph 17: refers to  a “loan production office”, “retail-oriented\nspace”, and “visible location”, which must be more specifically described, including\nthe size of the proposed office, the number of employees to be employed there, who\nprovides security protection to the office and the em ployees, and the necessar y\nsignage.  Further, there should be an absolute tim e limit for the Government to\nrespond to Defendants’ plan, such as a 20-day or 30-day time frame, a mechanism\nfor resolving disputes between the Government and Defendants with respect to this\nparagraph, and a provision requiring submission of the proposal to the Court; \n31.   Page 13, paragraph 19:   refers  to the opening of a new branch without\nestablishing a time frame, a time limit within which the Government must respond\nto Defendants’ proposal, or a result i f the Government fails to respond, such as\nautomatically granting Defendants’ proposal;\n32.  Page 15, paragraph 23: refers to four “outreach programs” every year without\nsufficiently identifying where the program will be held, who the speakers will be,\nwho will be invited, and how long the programs must be;\n33.  Page 16, paragraph 24: refers to a counseling program and an outreach seminar\nwithout sufficient detail;\n34.  Page 16, paragraph 25: refers to Defendants’ required advertising without\nspecifying in sufficient detail how the m oney must be spent and who selects the\nadvertiser and the type of advertising;\n35.  Page 17, paragraph 29: fails to specify who is determ ining a “qualified\napplicant”, which the Court notes seems to be the most significant part of the entire\nAgreed Order, and fails to delineate an obejctive criteria that must be met to qualify,\ni.e., credit score, credit history, etc.;\n36.  Page 17, paragraph 31: refers to the standa rds for underwriting a m ortgage\nwithout specifying who determines the standards for underwriting a mortgage;\n37.  Page 18, paragraph 33: refers to facilitating Defendants’ partnership with the\nCity of Detroit without further expanding or defining the partnership; and\n38.  Page 21, paragraph 39: refers to wh ether the Government waives sovereign\nimmunity through the execution of this Agered Order without sufficient detail or any\nreasons for refusal to waive sovereign immunity.\n5\n\nTo the extent that the Agreed Order contains provisions that are unnecessary or appear to\nserve no purpose, the Court notes such provisions at the following pages and paragraphs of the\nAgreed Order:\n39.  Page 8, paragraph 5: provides that Defendants shall give the Governm ent 30\ndays notice of any proposed changes, yetth e paragraph contains nothing with respect\nto whether the Government must approve or not approve of any changes;\n40.  Pages 14 and 15, paragraphs 22.(c) and 22.(d): refer to advertising options that\nare optional for Defendants;\n41.  Page 16, paragraph 28: use of  the phrase “may provide one or m ore of the\nfollowing” implies that Defendants’ financial assistance to “any qualified applicant”\nis optional, i.e., does this mean that Defendants must provide, or may provide?;\n42.  Page 17, paragraphs 29 and 30: appear to serve no purpose; and\n43.  Page 19, paragraph 35: appears to serve no purpose.\nTo the extent that the Agreed Order contains provisions that lack clarity, the Court notes\nsuch provisions at the following pages and paragraphs of the Agreed Order:\n44.  Pages 5 and 6: the order is expressed as an “Agreed Order”, yet it appears that\nDefendants vehemently deny that it violated any laws or unfair practices as alleged\nby the Government.  Even more revealing, the last paragraph on page 6 indicates that\nDefendants were forced to sign this “Agreed Order”, without alternatives, to avoid\nthe cost of litigation against the Government;\n45.  Page 7, paragraph 1:  references an injunction that refers to any act and any\naspect of real estate related transac tions when it should explicitly enjoin onl y\nviolations of the applicable law;\n46.  Page 13, paragraph 21: does this paragraph requi re Defendants to receive\npermission from the Government before opening any other branches?;\n47.  Page 16, paragraphs 26, 27, and 28: it ins ot clear how the “special program” and\n“special financing program” are related to the Government’s allegations, why the\n6\n\nprogram requires inclusion in this AgreedO  rder, how such a program may be forced\nupon Defendants, whether the Government is going to guarantee loans approved\nunder the “special program”, and whether the Court may enter an order that appears\nto satisfy the elements of extortion under Michigan law;5 and\n48.  Page 21, paragraph 40: fails to s ufficiently clarify any current or subsequent\nprovisions of law or orders that may effect the Agreed Order.\nFurther, the sole purpose for the Court to enter this Agreed Order is to guarantee that the\nparties continue to adhere to it untili ts expiration, yet, the Agreed Order is void of provisions that\nallow the Court to properly monitor the parties’ future conduct.  For illustrative purposes, the\nCourt notes some provisions that are void of any Court involvement or oversight at the following\npages and paragraphs of the Agreed Order:\n49.  Page 8, paragraph 5: provides that De fendants shall give the Government 30\ndays notice of any proposed changes to  the CRA Assessment, yet, the paragraph\ncontains nothing with respect to whether the Court receives notification of any\nproposed changes;\n50.  Page 8, paragraph 6: refers to a  description of a training plan that m ust be\nsubmitted to the Governm ent within 60 da ys of the entry of the or der without\nproviding for such reports to be filed with the Court; and\n5  Under Michigan law, to be guilty of extortion, one must:\n(1) maliciously threaten, orally or by written or printed communication;\n(2) either\n(a) to accuse another of any crime or offense or\n(b) to cause injury to the person or property or m other, father, husband, wife or child of\nanother;\n(3) with intent thereby either to\n(a) extort money or any pecuniary advantage whatever, or\n(b) compel the person so threatened to do or refrain from doing any act against his will.\nAdvocacy Org. for Patients & Providers v.

INTRODUCTION\nThis Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into jointlybythe parties to resolve \nthe claims of the United States in the matter styled United States of America v. Citizens Republic \nBancorp, Inc., et al., No. 2:11-cv-11976-LPZ-LJM (E.D. Mich.) (the “Lawsuit”) that Citizens \nRepublic Bancorp, Inc., as the successor to Republic Bank and parent companyto Citizens Bank, \nand Citizens Bank (collectively, “Citizens Bank” or “the bank”), have engaged in a pattern or \npractice of conduct in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. §§3601-3619, and the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f.  Citizens Bank denies these \nclaims. \nThere has been no factual finding or adjudication with respect to any matter alleged by \nthe United States.  Accordingly,  the  execution  of  this  Agreement  is  not,  and  is  not  to  be \nconsidered as, an admission or finding of any violation of the FHA or ECOA by Citizens Bank.  \nRather, the parties have entered into this Agreement to resolve voluntarily the claims asserted by \nthe United States in order to avoid the risks and burdens of litigation.  The parties agree that full \nimplementation of the terms of this Agreement will provide a resolution of the allegations of the \nUnited States in a manner consistent with Citizens Bank’s legitimate business interests.\nPursuant to this Agreement, Citizens Bank has entered into a partnership with the City of \nDetroit  to  provide  grants  to  homeowners  to  enhance  the  stability  and  revitalization  of \nneighborhoods to be identified by the City and the bank, as described in paragraph 7.  Further, \nCitizens Bank has agreed to take the actions described herein to ensure that its lending products \n1\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/!/1</=(////+;/>0/#!?\nExecution Version\nand services in the Detroit area are made available and marketed in majority-black census tracts1\non no less favorable a basis than in majority-white census tracts, in a manner consistent with safe \nand sound lending practices.\nII. TERMS OF AGREEMENT\nA. Non-Discrimination\n1. Citizens Bank, including all of its officers, employees, agents, representatives, \nassignees, and successors in interest, and all those in active concert or participation with anyof \nthem, will not engage in anyact or practice that (a) violates the FHA in any aspect of a \nresidential real estate-related transaction, or (b) violates ECOA in anyaspect of a residential \ncredit transaction.  This includes, but is not limited to:  marketing and advertising; the selection \nof sites for and the provision of services through branch offices or other channels;the definition \nof an assessment area under the CommunityReinvestment Act of 1977, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2906 \n(CRA); and the determination of geographic areas in which loan applications are solicited or \nfunded, except as specified in this agreement.\n2. Citizens Bank will take the actions that are reasonable and necessary, consistent \nwith safe and sound banking practices as determined bythe bank and its regulator, to ensure that \nthe bank offers and provides all persons with an equal opportunityto apply for and obtain \nresidential mortgage credit. \n1 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “majority-black census tract” is defined as a \ncensus tract where the population is more than 50% African-American or black.  The term \n“majority-white census tract” is defined as a census tract where the population is more than 50% \nnon-Hispanic white.  A list of the majority-black and majority-white census tracts in Wayne \nCounty, based upon the 2000 Census, is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.  The list will \nbe updated with data from the 2010 Census when publiclyavailable.\n2\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/:/1</=(////+;/>0/#!'\nExecution Version\n3. Citizens Bank will make available and market residential loan products in \nmajority-black census tracts in Wayne County on no less favorable a basis than in majority-white \ncensus tracts in Wayne County. \nB. CRA AssessmentArea\n4. In 2010, Citizens Bank revised its assessment area pursuant to the CRA and \nRegulation BB, its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. §228, to include all of Wayne County \nand the Cityof Detroit.  Citizens Bank will continue to include the entirety of Wayne County and \nthe Cityof Detroit in its CRA assessment area during the term of this Agreement.  Nothing in \nthis Agreement precludes Citizens Bank from changing its CRA assessment area outside of \nWayne County in the future in a manner consistent with the provisions of the CRA and its \nimplementing regulations.\nC. Fair Lending Training\n5. Citizens Bank will continue to provide, or document the provision of, periodic \ntraining on at least an annual basis during the term of this Agreement to all “employees with \nsignificant involvement in residential lending,” including independent contractors hired bythe \nbank with substantive responsibilities in developing or generating residential mortgage loans or \nloan products, to ensure that its activities are conducted in a nondiscriminatorymanner.2 This \ntraining will encompass the fair lending obligations under the FHA, ECOA, obligations under \nthe CRA, and responsibilities under this Agreement.  Citizens Bank will provide a description of \n2 For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “employees with significant involvement in \nresidential lending,” is defined to include only those employees who: (1)are required to be \nregistered as mortgage loan originators pursuant to the Secure and Fair Enforcement Mortgage \nLicensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act), 12 C.F.R. Part 208, Regulation H, Subpart I; and (2) are \ndirectlyinvolved in the marketing of residential mortgage loans on behalf of the bank.\n3\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/=/1</=(////+;/>0/#:8\nExecution Version\nthe training plan to the United States within fifteen (15) days of the effective date of the \nAgreement.  The United States will have a period of thirty (30) days to present any objection that \nit mayhave to the training proposal.  The parties will work cooperativelyto resolve anydisputes\ntheymayhave regarding the proposed training.  In addition, within fifteen (15) days of the \neffective date of the Agreement, Citizens Bank will provide to all employees who have \nsubstantive responsibilities for residential mortgage lending in the Detroit Consolidated \nMetropolitan Statistical Area (“CMSA”)3 with an explanation and copies of the applicable \nprovisions of this Agreement, and allow an opportunityfor such employees to have any \nquestions concerning the Agreement answered.  The bank will bear all costs associated with the \ntraining. \nD. Partnership with the City of Detroit\n6. Citizens Bank and the Cityof Detroit have agreed to a partnership in which the \nbank will assist the City’s efforts to promote sustained home ownership by providing grant funds \nto stabilize and revitalize neighborhoods.  Citizens Bank will devote $1.625 million to this grant \nprogram.\n7. The grant funds will be made available in neighborhoods identified by the Cityas \na part of the City’s Project 14 and the Detroit Works Project.  Under the program to be \nadministered by the City, the bank will provide existing homeowners in the identified \nneighborhoods in the Cityof Detroit (as defined by the bank and the City for purposes of the \n3   The  Detroit  CMSA  consists  of  the  Detroit  Primary Metropolitan  Statistical  Area \n(“PMSA”) (Lapeer, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne counties), the Flint PMSA \n(Genesee county), and the Ann Arbor PMSA (Lenawee, Livingston, and Washtenaw counties).  \n4\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/@/1</=(////+;/>0/#:#\nExecution Version\nprogram) with a matching grant of up to $10,000 for exterior improvements for projects of \n$20,000 or more.\n8. Residents who currentlyown a home identified as their primaryresidence in a \ntargeted neighborhood will be eligible for exterior improvement matching allowances.  Eligible \nstructures include owner-occupied residential properties consisting of one to two units.  These \ncan include detached single-family homes as well as row houses and townhomes.  Residences \nwhere homeowners’ associations, condominium association or other form of cooperative is \nresponsible for the building exterior are not eligible. \n9. Qualified improvements will be limited to the exterior of the home.  These \nimprovements include a wide range of beautification, weatherization and restoration projects.  \nThese projects include:\n• Roof replacement\n• Masonryrestoration\n• Window repair or replacement\n• Exterior restoration\n• Exterior painting\n• Exterior lighting\n• Gutters and downspouts\n• Siding & trim repair\n• Street Fronting Sitework (including fencing, walks, etc.)\n10. The grant program will be administered by the Cityor its designated partner, \nwhich will determine the qualifications for eligibility, zoning issues, contractor approval and \nother related issues.  Once the Cityhas issued final approval for an application, the grant check \nwill be issued byCitizens Bank in a manner directed bythe City.\n11. Preapproved projects with qualifying costs of $20,000 or more will receive the \nmaximum allowance of $10,000 upon project completion and proof of payment.  Preapproved \nprojects with qualifying costs of less than $20,000 will receive a 50% allowance reimbursement \n5\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/)/1</=(////+;/>0/#:!\nExecution Version\nupon project completion and proof of payment.  Future exterior improvement projects by \nresidents who have alreadyreceived one grant under this program remain eligible for matching \nfunds until the $10,000 total reimbursement is reached.  Qualifying project costs will be based on \nmaterials onlyfor Owners wishing to undertake their own repairs.\n12. Citizens Bank and the Cityof Detroit envision that the $1.625 million in grant \nfunds will be expended within three (3) yearsof the effective date of this Agreement, but the \nbank and the Cityretain the discretion to expend the grant funds on a more expedited basis if the \nbank and the Cityboth agree. \nE. Community Development Lenders\n13. As a part of its existing program to market residential mortgage loans in majority-\nblack residential areas of Wayne County, Citizens Bank has hired a person to fill the position of \n“CommunityDevelopment Lender” and currently is seeking to fill a second position with the \nsame objective.  Citizens Bank will hire the second CommunityDevelopment Lender within four \n(4) months of the effective date of the Agreement.  The persons hired as Community \nDevelopment Lenders will be employees of the bank and these positions will be maintained \nactively throughout the term of this Agreement, and will focus primarilyon generating \nresidential mortgage loans in the majority-black census tracts within Wayne County, as well as \nfacilitating the bank’s grant program described in paragraphs 6-12.  The duties of the \nCommunityDevelopment Lenders also mayinclude assisting the bank’s involvement in \ncommunitylending initiatives and outreach programs and serving as a resource to other staff to \nencourage and develop more lending within the majority-black census tracts of Wayne County.  \nThe CommunityDevelopment Lenders will report directlyto the Director of Mortgage Banking, \nwho is a member of the bank’s Corporate Compliance Committee, as described in paragraph 29. \n6\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/(/1</=(////+;/>0/#::\nExecution Version\nF. Physical Expansion in Wayne County\n14. Within ninety(90) days of the effective date of this Agreement, Citizens Bank \nwill establish and open a Loan Production Office (LPO) within a majority-black census tract in \nthe Cityof Detroit.  Within ninety(90) days of the effective date of this Agreement, Citizens \nBank will provide the United States with written notice of the location for the LPO and will set \nforth the services to be provided at the LPO.  The LPO will focus on the marketing and intake of \nresidential mortgage loan applications from residents of the majority-black census tracts in \nWayne County and grant applications for the partnership program described in paragraphs 6-12.  \nThe LPO will provide the base of operation for the CommunityDevelopment Lenders described \nin paragraph 13, and may be staffed with other personnel as necessaryto effectively market the \nbank’s residential mortgage loan products and grant program to the community.  The LPO will \nbear signage similar to that used for Citizens Bank’s branch offices and will be in a retail-\noriented space in a visible location accessible to concentrations of owner-occupied residential \nproperties in the majority-black census tracts in the Cityof Detroit.  Citizens Bank will continue \nto operate an LPO at the selected location or another location in a majority blackcensus tract in \nthe Cityof Detroit for the term this Agreement.\n15. Citizens Bank will continue to evaluate the feasibilityof branch expansion in the \nmajority-black census tracts of Wayne County, as part of a nondiscriminatoryplan for branching \nin the State of Michigan.  Citizens Bank will focus in particular on the feasibilityof converting \nthe LPO (referenced in paragraph 14 above) into a full-service branch, or opening a branch at \nanother location in a majority-black census tract of Wayne County, consistent with safe and \nsound banking practices.  Citizens Bank will follow the normal procedures of consultation with \nits regulator on these issues. \n7\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/?/1</=(////+;/>0/#:=\nExecution Version\n16. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Citizens Bank from opening or acquiring \nadditional facilities.  The bank will notifythe United States of anyplans to convert the LPO into \na full-service branch or open or acquire any new branches or other offices within the Detroit \nCMSA at the same time that Citizens Bank notifies its regulator so that the United States may \nraise any concerns with the bank and its regulator before regulator approval is granted.  \nG. Advertising and Consumer Education\n17. Citizens Bank will continue with its plan for advertising and marketing to \nmajority-black residential areas of Wayne County, and will continue to evaluate, enhance, and \nmodifythe program as necessaryto achieve its intended objectives.  In each year this Agreement \nis in effect, the program will include the following components:\n(a) Print Media. In addition to anyother print advertising, Citizens Bank will \ncontinue to advertise in at least one print medium specifically directed to African-American \nreaders, such as the Michigan Chronicle.  These advertisements will focus on meeting the \nresidential mortgage credit needs of the majority-black census tracts of Wayne Countyand may \ninclude special products or offers designed to meet those and other residential housing needs, \nincluding the grant program described in paragraphs 6-12.  Citizens Bank retains the discretion \nto determine the size, content, and frequencyof such advertising subject as a part of the overall \nmarketing plan.\n(b) Radio. Citizens Bank will place radio advertisements on at least two \nAfrican-American-oriented Detroit-area radio stations, such as KissDetroit 105.9, MIX 92.3, or\nWJLB 97.9.

Citizens Bank retains the discretion to determine the content and \nfrequencyof such radio spots subject to the standards set forth above and to place such \nadvertising on additional minority-oriented stations. \n(c) Promotional Materials.  Citizens Bank will utilize other marketing \nmethods as it deems appropriate to achieve its objectives in Wayne County.  The bank already \nhas used billboard advertising in Wayne County to market its residential mortgage loan products, \nand maycontinue to use this marketing approach.  The bank also may develop point-of-\ndistribution materials, such as posters and brochures, targeted toward the majority-black census \ntracts in Wayne Countyto advertise products and services, including any special loan products or \nservices made available pursuant to this Agreement.  Citizens Bank will place or display these \npromotional materials in its branch offices, LPO, and additional, appropriate distribution \nlocations in the majority-black census tracts, in addition to anyother places that the bank \nbelieves to be appropriate.\n(d) Direct Mailings.  Citizens Bank retains the option to utilize direct mailing \ntargeted to residents in the majority-black census tracts in Wayne County, but will ensure that a\nresidential lending marketing program in the majority-black census tracts is not limited solelyto \nexisting customers of the bank.  This does not preclude Citizens Bank from conducting other \nmarketing not focused on residential lending, by direct mail or otherwise, that is limited to \ncurrent customers.  \n(e) Citizens Bank will continue its practice of using an equal housing \nopportunitylogotype, slogan, or an audible statement “Equal Opportunity Lender” in advertising \nand marketing.  \n9\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/#8/1</=(////+;/>0/#:)\nExecution Version\n18.

This program will include a \nminimum of six (6) outreach seminars every year this Agreement is in effect, targeted towards \nresidents of majority-black census tracts in Wayne County.\n20. Citizens Bank will invest a minimum of $100,000 per year ($400,000 over the \nterm of this Agreement) for every year this Agreement is in effect.  The bank will allocate a \nminimum of $50,000 per year for advertising and marketing and a minimum of $50,000 per year \nfor consumer education and will have the discretion to determine how these funds are allocated \nwithin each category.  A minimum of one-half of the amount allocated to consumer education \nwill be dedicated to sponsoring such programs offered by community or governmental \norganizations engaged in fairlending work.  \nH. Program for Loan Subsidies\n21. Citizens Bank will make available $1.5 million in a program to increase the \nresidential mortgage credit that the bank extends to residents of majority-black census tracts of \nWayne County (“special financing program”).\n10\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/##/1</=(////+;/>0/#:(\nExecution Version\n22. The “special financing program” will offer residents in majority-black census \ntracts in Wayne Countyloan products at interest rates and/or on terms that are more \nadvantageous to the applicant than Citizens Bank would normally provide.\n23. Under the special financing program, the bank will subsidize each covered \ntransaction by one or more of the following means: an interest rate below that which Citizens \nBank would normallycharge, down payment or closing cost grants or assistance, or other \nfinancial aid.  The bank will provide one or more of the following forms of financial assistance \nto anyapplicant, qualified for a residential mortgage loan under the bank’s underwriting \nstandards that are normallyapplied for loans to be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or to be \ninsured byFHA or VA (“qualified applicant”):\n(a) a loan for a home purchase, refinancing, or home improvement at an \ninterest rate a minimum of 1/2 of a percentage point (50 basis points) below the otherwise \nprevailing rate, provided that if theprevailing rate (APR) for any such loan exceeds 8% at any \ntime during the term of this Agreement, the interest rate subsidywill be a minimum of 1%, and if \nthe prevailing APR exceeds 9% at any time during the term of this Agreement, the subsidywill \nbe a minimum of 1.5%; below the market rates for the loan type offered;\n(b) down payment assistance in the form of a direct grant of up to $7,500; or\n(c) closing cost assistance in the form of a direct grant of up to $7,500.\n24. Citizens Bank retains the discretion to offer more than one, or all, of the foregoing \nforms of financial assistance to qualified applicants on an individual basis as it deems \nappropriate under the factual circumstances of a particular application, so long as the maximum \ntotal financial assistance provided by the bank to an individual qualified applicant does not \nexceed $7,500.  Citizens Bank will have discretion to provide the loan subsidyamong its \n11\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/#!/1</=(////+;/>0/#:?\nExecution Version\nresidential loan products, and the bank, in its sole discretion, will applythe available funds in a \nmanner to assist otherwise qualified applicants in satisfying the financial aspects of a transaction, \nsuch as down payment or debt-to-income requirements.  \n25. The special financing program will be marketed in a manner reasonably designed \nto inform minorityresidents of all areas of Wayne Countyof the opportunityto participate in the \nprogram.  For example, advertisements on radio stations targeted to African-American residents \nwill be presumed to properlyinform residents of the program. \n26. No provision of this Agreement, including any special financing program, \nrequires Citizens Bank to alter its standards for underwriting mortgage loans that are applied \nregularly to make loans saleable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or comply with the provisions \napplicable for FHA/VA insurance.  The bank’s underwriting standards applied to residents of the \nmajority-black census tracts of Wayne Countymust be no less favorable than the standards that \nare applied in majority-white census tracts.  At the same time, no provision of this Agreement \nimposes an obligation on the bank to apply underwriting standards in majority-black census \ntracts that are more favorable than the standards applied in majority-white census tracts. \n27. The $1.5 million special financing program under the terms of this Agreement \nwill be the sum total of:  the cost to the bank of providing below-market financing and the dollar \namount of any grants for down payment assistance or closing cost assistance.\n28. The special financing program is intended to afford its benefits to qualified \napplicants who respond to the bank’s marketing program or otherwise seek residential mortgage \ncredit from the bank.  Citizens Bank’s compliance with the requirements of the special financing \nprogram will be measured byits good faith efforts to solicit loan applications from the majority-\nblack census tracts in Wayne County in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and \n12\n\n!\"##$%&$##'()$*+,$*-.///01%/2/#!$#///34567/8)9!:9##///+;/#:/1</=(////+;/>0/#:'\nExecution Version\nprovide the benefits of the program to qualified applicants.
