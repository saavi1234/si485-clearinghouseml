The DOJ alleged that the bank engaged in a practice called redlining by unlawfully failing to market and provide its lending products and services on an equal basis to minority neighborhoods in Chicago and Kankakee, Illinois. The DOJ specifically alleged that First American Bank intentionally failed to serve heavily African-American and Hispanic communities.  </p><p>The parties entered a settlement agreement that was approved by the court (Judge Der−Yeghiayan) on July 16, 2004. Under the settlement agreement terms, First American Bank is enjoined from engaging in any practice which discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any aspect of a residential real estate-related or credit transaction. </p><p>First American Bank agreed to open four new branch offices in minority communities within a three year-term. First American Bank will also invest $5 million in a special financing program for home mortgage lending, $400,000 in marketing and outreach, and $300,000 in consumer education and financial literacy programs.</p><p>The order is designed to last five years.  However, both parties agreed that if the Defendant-lender fulfilled all requirements of the order within four years, it has the option to terminate the order.  </p><p>On February 13, 2009, both parties filed an agreement to terminate the consent order, which was agreed to by the court (Judge Der−Yeghiayan) on February 19, 2009.</p><p>Similar cases brought forth by the Department of Justice against lenders due to allegations of redlining include <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12465\">United States v. Centier Bank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12455\">United States v.

      "title": "Chicago Bank Charged With Discriminatory \"Redlining\" Lending",
      "text": " \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CRT\nTUESDAY, JULY 13, 2004 (202) 514-2008\nWWW.USDOJ.GOV TDD (202) 514-1888\nCHICAGO BANK CHARGED WITH DISCRIMINATORY \n“REDLINING” LENDING\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - The Justice Department today announced the filing and resolution of a lawsuit\nagainst a Chicago lender. First American intentionally avoided serving the credit needs of residents and small\nbusinesses located in minority neighborhoods, a practice commonly referred to as redlining. First American has\nagreed to invest $5.7 million and open new branches in these minority neighborhoods to settle the lawsuit.\n\"All Americans should be able to access the financial markets without regard to their race,” said R. Alexander\nAcosta, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"We will continue to oppose vigorously any discrimination in\ncredit and lending services.\"\nThe Justice Department’s complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that First American intentionally\nfailed to market and provide lending products and services to predominantly minority neighborhoods because of\nrace. The complaint notes that not one of First American’s 34 branch offices is located in a minority area. The\ncomplaint alleges that statements by First American officials indicate that the Bank’s business practices were\nracially and ethnically motivated.\nThe Justice Department also filed today in federal district an enforceable settlement agreement resolving the\ncomplaint. Under the agreement, which remains subject to court approval, First American is enjoined from\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any aspect of a residential real estate-related or\ncredit transaction. In the settlement, First American agrees that over the next five years it will:\nopen four new full-service branch offices in areas affected by its allegedly discriminatory conduct;\ninvest $5 million in a special financing program under which it will offer residents and small businesses in\npredominantly minority neighborhoods, residential real estate-related, consumer, and small business loans\nat subsidized interest rates - at least one-half of a percentage point below that which the Bank would\nnormally charge;\nspend at least $400,000 to advertise its products in media and direct mailings targeted to generate loan\napplications from neighborhoods allegedly discriminated against;\nprovide a minimum of $300,000 to develop and implement a comprehensive consumer education program\nin credit counseling, financial literacy, and business planning for residents and small businesses in\n\npredominantly minority areas.\n“Home ownership is the American dream, and the ability to gain credit is crucial to the realization of that\ndream and to the development of all communities,” said Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the\nNorthern District of Illinois. “Redlining robs residents of minority communities of their equal right to a better life.\nAs this case shows, it will not be tolerated.”\nThe Federal Reserve Board referred this matter to the Department of Justice for enforcement after its 2001\nperiodic examination of the Bank gave the Board reason to believe that First American was engaged in\ndiscriminatory lending practices by redlining minority census tracts in the Chicago and Kankakee areas. Since\nNovember 2003, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been the Bank’s regulator.\nThe case resulted from a joint investigation conducted by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice\nand the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. First American Bank\ncooperated fully in the investigation. A copy of the Consent Order, as well as additional information about fair\nlending enforcement by the Department of Justice, can be obtained from the Justice Department website at\nwww.usdoj.gov/crt/housing.\n###\n04-478",

      "title": "Summary of $5.7 Million Consent Order",
      "text": "SUMMARY OF $5.7 MILLION CONSENT ORDER  \nBETWEEN FIRST AMERICAN BANK AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nThe United States' lawsuit alleges that First American Bank engaged in a pattern of \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in the extension of \nresidential real estate-related, consumer, and small business loans in the Chicago and \nKankakee, Illinois areas. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Bank avoided \nmarketing itself and doing business in minority census tracts because of the race or \nnational origin of the residents. This is a discriminatory practice known as redlining, \nwhich violates both the Fair Housing and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts. The parties \nhave agreed to resolve the suit through this Consent Order. \nNondiscrimination Injunction \nFirst American Bank is enjoined from engaging in any practice which discriminates on \nthe basis of race, color, or national origin in any aspect of a residential real estate-related \nor credit transaction. \nLending Initiatives - Monetary Relief \nIn order to remedy the alleged discrimination and ensure that all types of credit offered \nby First American are marketed and made available in minority residential areas on no \nless favorable a basis than in majority white residential areas, First American will: \n•  Open four new full-service branch offices in minority communities within three \nyears. Three of the branches will be in majority African American census tracts \nand one in a majority Hispanic census tract. \n•  Invest a minimum of $5 million over five years in a special financing program for \nhome mortgage, home equity, small business, community development, and \nconsumer lending for residents of and small businesses located in minority \ncensus tracts. This special financing program will provide subsidized interest \nrates for qualified residents and businesses in minority census tracts of a \nminimum of ½ of a percentage point below the standard interest rate then set by \nthe Bank for that product. The Bank will use its best efforts to make 30% of the \nsubsidized loans each year to small businesses, including community \ndevelopment loans for small businesses located in minority census tracts. \n•  Spend a minimum of $400,000 over the five-year term of the Order to expand \nthe Bank's marketing and outreach program by advertising in print media and on \nradio stations targeted to African American and Hispanic audiences, and by \ncreating point-of-sale materials, published in English, Spanish, and other foreign \nlanguages commonly used in minority census tracts, to advertise its products and \nservices. The Bank will also utilize direct mailings to residents and small \nbusinesses located in minority census tracts within the neighborhoods \nsurrounding the four new bank branches required under the Order. \n•  Invest a minimum of $300,000 in consumer education over the term of the \nOrder to provide credit counseling, financial literacy, business planning, and \nother related educational programs for residents of the minority census tracts. \n\n•  Deploy deposit-taking ATMs at all new branches, while locating off-premises \nATMs on a nondiscriminatory basis, principally in high-rise office buildings or \nthe central business district of Chicago. \n•  Employ a full-time person to direct its community lending program with \nresponsibility to oversee development of residential, consumer and small \nbusiness lending in minority census tracts and compliance with the Order. \n•  Provide fair lending training at least annually to all employees and agents \ninvolved in residential, consumer, and small business lending. \n•  Assess its progress in meeting the goals of the Order after two years by evaluating \nhow its residential, consumer, and small business lending operations are serving \nthe minority communities of the Chicago and Kankakee areas; reviewing the \navailability of government programs that could enhance its lending operations in \nminority communities; and meeting with community organizations involved in \npromoting fair lending, home ownership, and development in minority areas. \n•  Continue to include the entire Chicago and Kankakee Metropolitan Statistical \nAreas in its Community Reinvestment Act assessment area. \nMonitoring Compliance \nDuring the five-year term of the Order, First American will submit annually to the \nUnited States reports on its progress in fulfilling the goals of the Order, as well as the \nlending data it submits to the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council. First \nAmerican will retain all records relating to its obligations under the Order and make \nthem available to the United States upon request. If the Bank does not comply with the \nterms of the Order, which becomes effective when it is signed by the judge, the United \nStates can seek court enforcement of its terms. \nThe Order will last for five years, with the option to terminate the Order at any time after \nit has been in effect for four years, if the United States concludes that the Bank has fully \ncomplied with all the provisions of the Order. \n ",

This  Court  has  jurisdiction of  this  action pursuant  to \n28  U.S.C.  §1345,  42  U.S.C.  §3614,  and  15  U.S.C.  §1691(h).  Venue \nis appropriate  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §1391. \n3.  Defendant  First American  Bank  (hereinafter  \"First \nAmerican\"  or  \"Bank\")  is an  Illinois  state-chartered  full  service \nbank  headquartered  in Carpentersville,  Illinois,  and  doing \nbusiness  primarily  in  the  State  of  Illinois.  The  Bank  is a \nsubsidiary  of  First American  Bank  Corporation,  a  bank  holding \ncompany  incorporated  in  1984  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of \nDelaware. \n4.  First American  offers  the  traditional  services  of  a \n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 2 of 30 PageID #:2\nfinancial  depository  institution,  including  the  receipt  of  mone \ntary  deposits;  the  financing  of  residential  housing,  commercial, \nand  consumer  loans;  and  other  types  of  credit  transactions.  As \nof  March  31,  2004,  First American  Bank  had  total  assets  of  $1.9 \nbillion and  over  $1.7  billion  in  deposits.  First American  was \nsubject  to  the  regulatory  authority of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board \n(hereinafter  \"the  Board\")  until  November  24,  2003;  since  that \ntime,  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation has  been  its \nregulator. \n5.  The  Bank  is  subject  to  the  federal  laws  governing  fair \nlending  including  the  Fair Housing  Act,  the  Equal  Credit  Oppor \ntunity Act,  and  the  Community  Reinvestment  Act  (\"CRA\"),  12  U.S.C. \n§§2901-2906,  and  the  re'gulations  promulgated under  each  of  those \nstatutes.  The  Fair Housing  Act  and  the  Equal  Credit  Opportunity \nAct  prohibit  financial  institutions  from  discriminating  on  the \nbasis  of,  inter alia,  race,  color,  or national  origin  in  their \nlending  practices. \n6.  Beginning  in January  2001,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board \nconducted  an  examination  of  the  lending practices  of  First \nAmerican  Bank  to  evaluate  its compliance  with  the  Fair Housing \nAct,  the  Equal  Credit  Opportunity Act,  and  the  Community \nReinvestment  Act.  Based  on  information  gathered  in  its \nexamination,  the  Board  determined  that  it had  reason  to  believe \nthat  First American  was  engaged  in a  pattern or practice of  dis-\n- 2-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 3 of 30 PageID #:3\ncrimination  on  the  bases  of  race  and  national  origin by  redlining \nmajority minority  census  tracts  - defined  as  those  with non-white \npopulations  of  50%  or  greater  - in  the  Chicago  and  Kankakee, \nIllinois,  metropolitan  areas.  The  Board  determined  that  the  Bank \nwas  engaged  in practices which  prevented  or  discouraged  the \nresidents  of  those  census  tracts  from  obtaining equal  access  to \nresidential,  consumer,  and  small  business  credit because  of  the \nrace,  color,  or  national  origin  of  the majority  of  the  tracts' \nresidents.  The  Board  also  lowered  First American's  CRA  rating  to \n\"Substantial Noncompliance\",  the  lowest  possible.  Of  the  312 \nlending  institutions  the  Board  rated  for  CRA  compliance  between \nJuly  1,  2001,  and  June  30,  2002,  First American  was  the  only \nlender  to  receive  that  rating;  the  Board  rated  40  lenders  as \n\"Outstanding\",  270  \"Satisfactory\",  and  1  \"Needs  to  Improve\". \n7.  Pursuant  to  15  U.S.C.  §1691e(g),  the  Board  referred  the \nmatter  to  the Attorney General  on  May  14,  2002,  for  appropriate \nenforcement  action,  following  the  Board's  determination  as \ndescribed  in  Paragraph  6. \n8.  First American  Bank  originated  in  the  1980s  from  the \nconsolidation  of  eight  smaller Chicago  and  Kankakee  metropolitan \narea  banks.  By  1995,  those  banks  had been  further  consolidated \ninto  three  banks  - First American  Bank,  Carpentersville;  First \nAmerican  Bank,  Kankakee;  and  First American  Bank,  Joliet.  In \nSeptember  1999,  First American  Bank  Corporation  consolidated  the \n-3 -\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 4 of 30 PageID #:4\ncharters  of  those  three  institutions  into  one  charter,  First \nAmerican  Bank,  Carpentersville,  Illinois.  By  January  2003,  First \nAmerican  had  grown  to  a  network  of  thirty-four branch  offices \nlocated  throughout  the  Chicago/Kankakee  region.  Throughout  this \ntime  period,  the banks  were  all  operated under  the  same  manage \nment. \n9.  The  Chicago  Metropolitan  Statistical Area  (hereinafter \n\"Chicago  MSA\"),  as  defined by  the  United  States  Census,  includes \nnine  counties- Cook  (including  the  City of  Chicago),  DeKalb, \nDuPage,  Grundy,  Kane,  Kendall,  Lake,  McHenry,  and Will. \n10.  Residential  housing  data  for  the  Chicago  MSA  show  sig \nnificant  patterns  of  racial  and  ethnic  segregation.  According  to \n2000  Census  data,  the  Chicago  MSA  is  the  third-most  segregated \nmetropolitan area  in  the  nation  for  both African Americans  and \nHispanics  of  the  metropolitan  areas  with  populations  of  either \ngroup  above  500,000.  According  to  the  2000  Census,  ninety \npercent  (90%)  of  the  Chicago  MSA's  African American  residents  and \n76%  of  its Hispanic  residents  live  in Cook  County,  while  68%  of \nthe MSA's  African  American  residents  and  53%  of  its Hispanic \nresidents  reside  in  the  City  of  Chicago.  709  of  the  800  majority \nminority  census  tracts  in  the  Chicago  MSA  are majority African \nAmerican,  Hispanic,  or  combined  African American/Hispanic.  Eight \ncensus  tracts  are majority Asian  and  the  other  83  minority  tracts \nare  a  combination  of  various  racial  and  ethnic minorities.  See \n-4-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 5 of 30 PageID #:5\nMap  attached as  Exhibit  1. \n11.  The  Kankakee  Metropolitan  Statistical Area  (hereinafter \n\"Kankakee  MSA\"),  as  defined by  the  United  States Census,  encom \npasses  Kankakee  County.  The  Kankakee  MSA,  located approximately \nsixty miles  south  of  Chicago,  has  26  census  tracts,  of  which  four \nare majority African American  and  include  over  60%  of  the MSA's \nAfrican American  population.  See Map  attached as  Exhibit  1. \n12.  In operating  and  extending  the  scope  of  its business, \nFirst American  has  acted  to meet  the  residential,  consumer,  and \nbusiness  credit needs  of  predominantly white  residential  census \ntracts  (census  tracts with  a  population greater  than  50%  non \nHispanic  white)  throughout  the  Chicago  and  Kankakee  MSAs  (here \ninafter  \"the  Chicago  region\"),  and  has  avoided  serving  the \nlending and  credit needs  of  majority minority  tracts. \n13.  By  the  September  1999  consolidation,  First American  had \nexpanded  its business,  including  that  of  extending  credit  for \nresidential  real  estate-related transactions,  home  equity,  small \nbusiness,  and motor  vehicle  and  other  consumer  loans,  to  sub \nstantial portions  of  the  Chicago  region.  In  addition  to  en \nlarging  the  geographic  scope  of  the  area within which  it extends \nsuch  credit,  a  major  component  of  the  Bank's  expansion  included \nthe  construction or  acquisition  of  additional  branch  offices, \nwhich  are  designed both  to  better serve  existing customers  and  to \nattract new  customers  to  First American's  services  and products. \n-5 -\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 6 of 30 PageID #:6\n14.  First American  has  engaged  in a  race- and national \norigin-based pattern of  locating  or  acquiring branch  offices.  It \nhas  located or  acquired branch  offices  to  serve  the  residential, \nconsumer,  and  small  business  lending  and  credit needs  of  majority \nwhite  census  tracts  but  not  those  of  majority minority  tracts. \nIn January,  2001,  when  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  commenced  its \ncompliance  examination,  First American  had  30  branch  offices  in \nthe  Chicago  region.  None  of  those  30  branches  are  located  in  a \nmajority minority  census  tract.  According  to  the  2000  Census, \nthe  30  branches  are  located  in majority white  census  tracts  in \nwhich  minority populations  range  from  0.6%  to  26.7%.  See  Map \nattached as  Exhibit  2. \n15.  Over  the  next  two  years,  the  Bank  continued  its race \nand  national  origin-based pattern of  adding  or acquiring  new \nbranch  offices  to  serve  only white  communities.  By  January  2003, \nFirst American  had  34  branches,  with  three  new  ones  in Cook \nCounty  and  one  in Lake  County.  All  four  of  these  new  bank \nbranches  are  located  in majority  white  areas.  See  Map  attached \nas  Exhibit  3. \n16.  Race  and  national  origin  considerations  also  underlie \nthe  distribution  of  First American's  Automated  Teller Machines \n( \"ATMs\").  As  of  January  2001,  the  Bank  had  78  full-service  ATMs \n(deposit  taking  and  cash-dispensing)  in  the  Chicago  region.  None \nof  the  Banks's  full-service  ATMs  was  located  in a  majority \n-6 -\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 7 of 30 PageID #:7\nminority  census  tract.  However,  the  Bank  had  chosen  to  locate  18 \n(approximately  10%)  of  its cash-dispensing-only ATMs  (also  called \n\"CDMs\")  in minority  census  tracts.  See  Maps  of  ATMs  and  CDMs \nattached as  Exbibits  4  and  5,  respectively. \n17.  First American  has  actively  solicited credit  trans \nactions  through  a  variety  of  discriminatory means,  including,  but \nnot  limited to,  the  use  of  mortgage  brokers  primarily  serving \nwhite  communities  in  the  Chicago  region.  As  of  January  2001,  the \nBank  had  a  mortgage  broker  network  of  122  offices,  all  but  one  in \nthe  Chicago  MSA.  Of  that  total,  97.5%  (119)  were  located  in \nmajority white  census  tracts  and  only  2.5%  (3)  were  located  in \nminority  tracts,  each  of  which  have  small  populations.  See  Map \nattached as  Exhibit  6. \n18.  The  unlawful  consideration  of  race  and  national  origin \nin  the  business  practices and  customer  solicitation  efforts  of \nFirst American  is also  evident  from  its advertising  and marketing \npractices,  including,  but  no.t  limited to,  its  radio  and  newspaper \nadvertising  focus.  The  Bank  has  directed its radio  advertising \nto  stations  that  target  \"general  audiences\",  although many \nminority  format  stations  exist  in  the  Chicago  MSA  market.  In \nadvertising  its products  and  services  through  the media,  First \nAmerican  never  utilized radio  stations  oriented  to minority \ncommunities  in  the  Chicago  MSA  until  after  the  Board's  criticism \nof  those  advertising practices. \n-7 -\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 8 of 30 PageID #:8\n19.  The  Bank  has  also  consistently directed  its print media \nadvertising  to  daily newspapers  of  general  circulation and \nneighborhood  and  suburban  weekly  newspapers  serving  largely non \nminority  city neighborhoods  and  suburbs  in  the  Chicago  MSA. \nUntil  at  least December  2002,  the  Bank  had never  advertised  in \nminority-focused publications,  many  of  which  have  larger  cir \nculations  than  some  suburban  newspapers  the  Bank  has  used. \n20.  The  unlawful  consideration of  race  and national  origin \nin  the  business  and  customer  solicitation efforts  of  the  Bank  is \nalso  evident  from  the  community  service,  or  assessment  area, \nboundaries  that  First American  has  established under  the  Com \nmunity  Reinvestment  Act.  In  establishing and modifying  its \nassessment  area  over  time,  First American  long  excluded nearly \nall predominantly minority neighborhoods  in  the  Chicago  MSA. \nPursuant  to  statutory direction,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board \npromulgated  regulations  to  implement  the  CRA,  12  C.F.R.  §228 \n(\"Reg  BB\").  Under  Reg  BB,  .as  amended  in  1997,  a  large bank's \nassessment  area must  generally consist  of  one  or more  metro \npolitan areas  or  contiguous  political  subdivisions,  §228.41(b), \nunless  that  area  would  be  extremely  large,  of  unusual  con \nfiguration,  or  divided by  significant geographic  barriers, \n§228.41(d).  Reg  BB  further  provides  that,  if  a  large  bank's \nassessment  area  does  not  include  entire political  jurisdictions, \nits assessment  area may  not  reflect  illegal  discrimination. \n- 8-\n___ :.:_=--\"\"-'-'-'\"-\"\"-'-\"'''_,.\"-'_-\",\"-'.\"  ---'-'--\"-\"\"'-\"--'--------'---------------~- ------\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 9 of 30 PageID #:9\n§228.41(e).  First American's  assessment  area  historically has \nnot  included  entire political  subdivisions,  such  as  the  City of \nChicago  or  all  of  Cook  and  Kankakee  Counties.  The  inclusion  of \nthese  entire  jurisdictions would  not  create  an  assessment  area \nwhich would  be  extremely  large,  of  unusual  configuration,  or \ndivided by  significant  geographic  barriers,  the  only  exceptions \nspecifically permitted by  Reg  BB. \n21.  Instead of  defining  its assessment  area  in accordance \nwith  Reg  BB,  First American  has  circumscribed  its  lending  area  in \nthe  Chicago  region  to  exclude most  majority minority neighbor \nhoods.  For  example,  in  1998,  the  Bank  delineated  six highly \nirregularly-shaped assessment  areas,  and,  in  late 1999,  it \nreconfigured  them  to  consist  of  two  distinct  areas  of  the  Chicago \nand  Kankakee  MSAs.  The  Bank's  Chicago  MSA  assessment  area \ndelineation  excluded most  minority  communities  in  the  Chicago \nMSA,  despite  a  large  number  of  them  being  adjacent  to  the  non \nminority  tracts  included  in  the  assessment  area.  The  Bank's  1999 \nChicago  MSA  assessment  area  included portions  of  six counties  -\nCook,  DuPage,  Kane,  McHenry,  Lake,  and  DeKalb  - and  its Kankakee \nassessment  area  included  only  a  portion of  that  county.  The  1999 \nChicago  MSA  assessment  area  included  792  census  tracts,  of  which \nonly  51,  6.4%,  had  a  population  that was  majority minority.  In \nthe  Chicago  MSA,  over  34%  of  the  census  tracts were  majority \nminority  according  to  the  1990  census  and  over  42%  were  majority \n-9-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 10 of 30 PageID #:10\nminority  according  to  the  2000  census.  The  Bank  has  not  provided \nany  nondiscriminatory  rationale  for  its  irregular,  atypical \nassessment  areas,  not  even  the most  rudimentary  objective \nmethodology  allegedly used  to  define  them.  See  Map  attached as \nExhibit  7. \n22.  Only  in March  2001,  after  the  Federal  Reserve  Board's \ncompliance  examiners  expressed  concern  to  Bank  management  about \nthe  assessment  areas'  exclusion  of  virtually all minority  census \ntracts,  did First American  change  its assessment  area  delineation \nto  include  all  of  the  Chicago  and  Kankakee  MSAs. \n23.  First American  Bank  officials have  also made  statements \nto  examiners  from  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Chicago  with \nrespect  to  the  Bank's  lending practices which  are  based  on  racial \nand  ethnic  stereotypes.  Among  those  statements  were  ones  which: \n(a)  indicated  that  the  Bank  did not  provide  the  full  range  of  its \nservices  and  lending  products  to  minority borrowers  because  they \nwere  allegedly not  interested in  the  full  range  of  services  the \nBank  offered  to white  customers;  (b)  indicated  that  the  Bank  did \nnot  provide  the  full  range  of  its  services  and  lending products \nto minority borrowers  because  they  were  allegedly qualified only \nfor  government-subsidized  lending programs;  and,  (c)  equated \nmaking  loans  in  low  income  or minority neighborhoods  with making \nbad  loans. \n24.  Analyses  of  First American's  residential  real  estate-\n- 10-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 11 of 30 PageID #:11\nrelated  loan  applications  for  1999-2001  show  that  First American \nhas  served  the  credit needs  of  predominantly white  census  tracts \nof  the  Chicago  region  to  a  significantly greater  extent  than  it \nhas  served  the  credit  needs  of  predominantly minority neighbor \nhoods. \n25.  From  1999-2001,  First American  generated  10,365 \nresidential  real  estate-related loan  applications  in  the  Chicago \nregion,  but  only  705,  or  6.8%,  were  secured by  residential \nproperty  located  in majority  minority  census  tracts.  See  Map \nattached as  Exhibit  8. \n26.  In  contrast,  the  percentage  of  such  applications  in  the \nChicago  region which  were  secured by  residential  property  located \nin majority minority  census  tracts  for  the  aggregate  of  all \nChicago  and  Kankakee  MSA  lending  institutions was  20.8%,  more \nthan  three  times  higher  than  First American's. \n27.  In  connection with  the  Board's  2001  fair  lending  exam \nination,  First American  identified a  group  of  twelve  \"peer\" \ninstitutions  to  which  it recommended  its  lending performance  be \ncompared.  Of  the  total  residential  real  estate-related  loan \napplications  submitted  to  this  \"peer group\"  in  each year  from \n1999-2001,  First American's  percentage  from  majority minority \ncensus  tracts  ranged  from  6.2%  to  7.3%  annually.  In  contrast, \nthe  percentage  of  such  applications  for  the  aggregate  of  this \nself-selected  \"peer  group\"  ranged  from  16%  to  26%  each  year. \n- 11-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 12 of 30 PageID #:12\n28.  The  geographic  distribution  of  the  dollar amounts  of \nresidential  real  estate-related loans  funded  by  First American \nalso  demonstrates  the  consistently  stark  racial  and  national \norigin division  in  its residential  lending  activities.  Between \n1999  and  2001,  First American  funded  nearly  $287,892,000  in \nsingle-family  residential  real-estate  related  loans  in  the \nChicago  region.  Only  4.5%,  about  $13,087,000,  went  to  majority \nminority  census  tracts. \n29.  The  business  policies  and  practices  of  First American \ndescribed  in ~~12-24 above  have  achieved  the  Bank's  objective  of \nserving white  communities  and not  minority  communities,  as \nfurther  demonstrated  by  the  Bank's  overall  residential,  consumer, \nand  small  business  lending  over  time. \n30.  In  1999,  the  Bank  originated a  total  of  7,054  loans  in \nthe  following  categories  - residential  real  estate-related,  home \nequity,  motor  vehicle,  other  secured  consumer,  other  unsecured \nconsumer,  small  business,  and  other  small  business.  Of  that  loan \ntotal,  only  274,  or  3.9%,  were  made  in majority minority  census \ntracts.  In  2000,  the  Bank  originated a  total  of  7,069  loans  in \nthose  seven  categories,  of  which  only  308,  or  4.4%,  were  made  in \nmajority minority  census  tracts.  Of  the  combined  total  of  14,123 \nsuch  loans  the  Bank  originated  in  1999  and  2000,  only  4.1%  were \nmade  in majority minority  census  tracts  in a  region where  34%  of \nthe  census  tracts were  majority minority  in  1990. \n- 12-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 13 of 30 PageID #:13\n31.  For  1999-2000,  the  Bank  originated 1,226  motor  vehicle \nloans  of  which  97.6%  (1196)  were  made  in majority white  census \ntracts  and  only  2.4%  (30)  in majority minority  tracts.  The \nstrikingly  low  percentage  of  such  loans  in minority  census \ntracts,  despite  the widespread  ownership  of  automobiles  by  con \nsumers  in neighborhoods  of  varying  racial  or  ethnic  character \nistics,  evidences  the  Bank's  intentional  exclusion  of  minority \ncommunities  from  its lending  operations.  See  Map  attached as \nExhibit  9. \n32.  Further  demonstrating  First American's  redlining \npractices  is  the  demographic  distribution  of  its  largest volume \ncredit product  - home  equity  loans.  In  1999-2000,  the  Bank \noriginated  6,365  home  equity  loans,  of  which  96.2%  (6,123)  were \nin majority white  tracts  and  only  3.8%  (242)  were  in minority \ntracts  despite  the  fact  that  33%  of  the  Chicago  region's  housing \nstock  is  located  in minority  census  tracts.  See  Map  attached as \nExhibit  10. \n33.  The  Bank's  CRA  small  business  loan  originations  for \n1999-2000  show  the  same  discriminatory pattern and  practice.  Of \nthe  1,330  CRA  small  business  loans  the  Bank  originated  in  the \nChicago/Kankakee  MSAs,  1,268  (95.3%)  were  made  in majority white \ncensus  tracts,  and  only  62  (4.7%)  in minority  tracts  in a  region \nwhich  has  among  the highest  number  of  minority-owned businesses \nin  the  nation,  over  95,000.  See  Map  attached  as  Exhibit  11. \n- 13-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 14 of 30 PageID #:14\n34.  The  totality of  First American's  policies  and  practices \ndescribed herein  constitute  the  redlining  of  majority minority \nneighborhoods  of  the  Chicago  and  Kankakee  MSAs  as  off-limits  for \nthe  defendant's  lending  business.  The  Bank's  policies  and  prac \ntices  are  intended  to  deny  and  discourage,  and  have  the  effect  of \ndenying  or  discouraging,  an  equal  opportunity  to  residents  of \nminority neighborhoods,  on  account  of  the  racial  and/or  national \norigin  composition  of  those  neighborhoods,  to  obtain  residential \nreal  estate-related credit,  consumer  credit,  and  business  credit. \nThese  policies  and  practices  are  not  justified by  business  neces \nsity or  legitimate business  considerations. \n35.  The  defendant's  actions  as  alleged herein  constitute: \na.  Discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  and  national \norigin  in making  available  residential  real  estate-related trans \nactions,  in violation  of  the  Fair Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C. \n§3605 (a); \nb.  The  making  unavailable  or  denial  of  dwellings  to  persons, \nbecause  of  race,  color,  and  national  origin,  in violation  of  the \nFair Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §3604(a); \nc.  Discrimination on  the basis  of  race,  color,  and  national \norigin  in  the  terms,  conditions,  or privileges  of  the  provision \nof  services  or  facilities  in  connection with  the  sale  or  rental \nof  dwellings,  in violation of  the  Fair Housing  Act,  42  u.s.c. \n§3604(b);  and \n- 14-\n\nCase: 1:04-cv-04585 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/13/04 Page 15 of 30 PageID #:15\nd.  Discrimination against  applicants with  respect  to  credit \ntransactions,  on  the basis  of  race,  color,  and national  origin, \nin violation of  the  Equal  Credit  Opportunity Act,  15  U.S.C. \n§1691 (a) (1). \n36.  The  defendant's  policies  and practices  as  alleged \nherein  constitute: \na.  A pattern or practice of  resistance  to  the  full  enjoy \nment  of  rights  secured by  the  Fair Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§3601 \net  seq.,  and  the Equal  Credit  Opportunity Act,  15  U.S.C. \n§1691e(h};  and \nb.
