    "summary": "<p>On July 20, 2004, a lesbian couple living in Florida filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against the U.S. Attorney General and Clerk for the Circuit and Country Courts of Hillsborough County, Florida, challenging the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Florida's implementation of the statute.  Plaintiffs brought their lawsuit after a clerk in the Circuit Court's Office in Hillsborough Country refused to recognize their Massachusetts marriage license. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court to declare DOMA and the corresponding Florida statute unconstitutional and enjoin their enforcement. The plaintiffs alleged that the two statutes violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. </p><p>The plaintiffs asserted that Florida is required to recognize their valid Massachusetts marriage license because DOMA exceeds Congress' power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. They also argued that twelve U.S. Supreme Court Cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and ending with Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), demonstrate a recent trend by the Supreme Court to expand the fundamental liberty of personal autonomy in connection with one's intimate affairs and family relations. The plaintiffs urged the Court in the case at bar to expand on these cases and find that the right to enter into a same-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution. </p><p>On September 27, 2004, the U.S. filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that DOMA does not infringe on any of the plaintiffs' fundamental rights and is a legitimate exercise of the power granted to Congress by the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  On January 19, 2005, Judge James S. Moody, Jr., granted the defendant's Motion to Dismiss. The Court rejected the plaintiff's interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, saying that Congress' actions are an appropriate exercise of its power to regulate conflicts between the laws of two different States, in this case, conflicts over the validity of same-sex marriage. Florida is not required to recognize or apply Massachusetts' same-sex marriage law because it clearly conflicts with Florida's legitimate public policy of opposing same-sex marriage.</p><p>The Court went on to say that it was bound the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), who dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal of Minnesota's Supreme Court ruling that the right to marry without regard to the sex of the parties is not a fundamental right of all persons (and thus a similar state statute to the one in the case at bar did not violate the Due Process Clause or Equal Protection Clause). </p><p>Regarding Due Process, the Court said the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence only determined that a Texas statute prohibiting homosexual sodomy failed under the rational basis analysis, and in no way can be interpreted as creating a fundamental right to same-sex marriage. The Court also expressed its reservations about elevating rights to fundamental status, since to do so would remove policy decisions from the hands of the people and into the guardianship of unelected judges. Willams v. Pryor, 378 F.3d 1232, 1250. Therefore, the Court found that the right to marry a person of the same sex is not a fundamental right under the Constitution.</p><p>On the issue of Equal Protection, the Court stated that the Eleventh Circuit has held that homosexuality is not a suspect class that would require subjecting DOMA to strict scrutiny, Lofton v. Sec. of Dept. of Children and Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 818 (11th Cir. 2004), and that DOMA does not discriminate on the basis of sex because it treats women and men equally, In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 143 (W.D. Wash. 2004), and therefore it must apply rational basis review. The Court held that encouraging the raising of children in homes consisting of a married mother and father is a legitimate state interest, See Lofton, 358 F.3d at 819-20, and DOMA is rationally related to this interest. </p><p>On March 7, 2005, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the remainder of the case (involving the State of Florida) and the case was closed on March 8, 2005.</p>",

On January 19, 2005, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that DOMA falls within Congress' power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the right to same-sex marriage is not a fundamental right under the Constitution, and that DOMA passes the rational basis review test and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 1331. This is a civil action arising \nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States presenting a substantial Federal \nquestion. \n2.  Venue is properly  in the  Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, pursuant to  28 \nUnited States Code 1391. Both Defendants AKE and ASHCROFT have offices for the \nconduct of official business in Hillsborough County, Florida: also a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving raise to the claim occurred in the Middle District of Florida, \nTampa Division. \n3.  This is an action for a Declaratory Judgment pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2201 and Rule 57 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of determining an actual and \nexisting  justiciable  controversy  to  declare  the  rights  and  other  legal  relations  and \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 2 of 15 PageID 7\nquestions of construction and/or the validity of an Act of Congress and a Florida Statute \nbetween the parties as hereinafter more fully appears. \nBACKGROUND \n4.  Through the institution of marriage, society publicly guarantees individuals respect and \nlegitimacy as a couple. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage \nprovides an abundance of legal, financial and social benefits. The ability to marry and to \nthereby  participate  in  this  fundamental  societal  institution  is  something  that  most \nAmericans take for granted.  Florida Same-sex couples do not; they are denied access \nsolely on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender. \n5.  The  Supreme Court of the  United States has found that the right to  marry  is  not a \nprivilege  conferred  by  the  State,  but  a  fundamental  right  that  is  protected  against \nunwarranted  State  interference.  As  Mr.  Chief Justice  WARREN  said  in \nVirginia, 87 S. Ct. 1817 (1967) atp. 1824; \n\"The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the \nvital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by \nfree men. \nMarriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to \nour very existence and survival.\" \nThis right is vitiated if one is denied the right to marry a person of one's choice; the \ndecision to marry is among the personal decisions that is part of the fundamental \"right of \nprivacy\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n6.  Our highest court has also mandated that if a law \"impinges upon a fundamental right \nexplicitly  or  implicitly  secured  by  the  Constitution,  (it)  is  presumptively \nunconstitutional.\"  As  a  result,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  government to  pass  a  \"strict \nscrutiny\" test by the courts for certain classifications and fundamental rights to be valid; \nthe government must justify an intrusion on Plaintiffs'  fundamental rights of privacy, \nliberty and autonomy found in the Due_ Process Clause and the right of equality in the \nEqual Protection Clause. Excluding same-sex couples from a basic element of civic life -\nmarr1age  infringes human dignity and violates the Constitution of the United States, \nwhich affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals; it forbids the creation of second-\n2 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 3 of 15 PageID 8\nclass citizens. There is no identifiable constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil \nmarriage to same-sex couples. \nPlaintiffs  would  show  that  the  Act  of Congress  and  the  Florida  Statute  under  the \nmicroscope here and both of which define \"marriage\" as a legal union between one man \nand  one  woman  as  husband  and  wife  AND  which  prohibit recognition of same-sex \nmarriages  - - can  meet  constitutional  muster  ONLY  if they  further  a  compelling \ngovernmental  interest and the  legislation substantially furthers  that interest,  doing so \nthrough the least restrictive means to overcome the  constitutional right.  The ordinary \ndeference  due  legislation  does  not  apply  when  fundamental  constitutional  rights  are \nimplicated. \n7.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to construe constitutional rights which operate in favor of the \nindividual against government so as to achieve the primary goal of individual freedom \nand  autonomy - - especially where  homosexuals  are  the traditional  targets  of unfair, \nirrational and unlawful discrimination. \n8.  The  legislative  decisions  of Congress  and  Florida are  clearly  erroneous,  arbitrary  or \nwholly unwarranted here; their decisions clearly transgress private rights. \nIn spite of the foregoing, the United States' and Florida's statutory codes as detailed later, \ndo not permit marriages of lesbian and gay couples. It is this selective denial of marriage \nequality to this disfavored group that has led to this action. \nPLAINTIFFS \n9.  Plaintiffs are a lesbian couple who are citizens of the United States, over 18 years of age \nseeking to live a full life by availing themselves of a marriage universally recognized, the \nsocial  validation  it  confers,  and the  hundreds  of rights,  responsibilities,  benefits  and \nobligations that it affords and which are predicated on marriage under the laws of the \nUnited States and the State of Florida. These Plaintiffs share the same goal as countless \n\"straight\" American couples; their reasons for wanting to engage in a recognized civil \nceremony of marriage are the same as the reasons of heterosexual couples. Plaintiffs seek \nonly to  be  married,  not  to  undermine  the  institution of marriage;  they  do  not want \nmarriage abolished; they do not attack the binary nature of marriage, the consanguinity \nprovisions  or  any  of the  other  gate-keeping  provisions  of marriage  licensing  laws. \nRecognizing  same-sex  marriages  will  not diminish the  nature,  dignity  or validity  of \nopposite-sex marriages. \n3 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 4 of 15 PageID 9\n10.  Plaintiffs do not have another living wife or husband; they are not first cousins or any \nnearer of kin to each other; and neither is incapable for want of legal age or sufficient \nunderstanding. They consent freely to marry each other; but for the fact that they are \nsame-sex  couples,  the  United  States  and  the  State  of Florida would  recognize  their \nmarnage. \n11.  The Plaintiffs want to live with the confidence that, if one of them unexpectedly dies or \nbecomes disabled or sick, the  other will have  all  of the protections that marriage  in \nFlorida affords. Although they have tried to make arrangements to maximize economic \nand legal protections for their families' well-being, marriage affords greater security in \nlight of the many legal benefits that are reserved for spouses. These Plaintiffs need the \nbenefits of marriage to protect themselves from economic hardship and discrimination. \n12.  Plaintiffs have been legally married in the State of Massachusetts and now hold a valid \nmarriage license from that State. They have personally presented that marriage license to \na Deputy Clerk of the Hillsborough Circuit Court Clerk's Office, asking for recognition \nand acceptance of the valid and legal Massachusetts marriage license. Their demand was \nrefused by the Defendant AKE, whose Deputy Clerk stated that according to Federal and \nFlorida  law,  the  Clerk  is  not  allowed  to  recognize,  for  marriage  purposes,  the \nMassachusetts  marriage  license,  because  Federal  and  Florida  law  prohibit  such \nrecognition. \nAs a result, the United States and the State of Florida send a stigmatizing message that \nPlaintiffs are less worthy than other Americans and that their relationship is inferior to \nthose of other Americans. \n13.  Plaintiff REV. NANCY WILSON is  a senior pastor of the Metropolitan Community \nChurch and Plaintiff DR. PAULA SCHOENWETHER is a Ph.D and a former family \nmarriage  counselor.  They lived  together and are  residents  of the  Middle  District of \nFlorida. \nDEFENDANTS \n14.  Defendant RICHARD L. AKE is the duly elected Clerk of the Circuit and County Courts \nin and for the  Judicial Circuit of Florida and, pursuant to Florida Statute 741.01 (1), \n13th \nis the public official who  shall issue every marriage license upon application for  the \n4 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 5 of 15 PageID 10\nlicense, \"if there appears to be no impediment to the marriage.\" He is also the proper \nofficial  to  recognize  and record  legal  marriage  licenses,  if requested to  do  so.  This \nDefendant is sued in his official capacity. \nDefendant JOHN ASHCROFT is the  duly appointed Attorney General  of the  United \nStates.  According to 28  U.S.  Code ยง 501, The Department of Justice is an executive \ndepartment of the United States at the seat of Government. Section 503 designates that, \n\"The Attorney General is the head of the Department of Justice;\" and \"all functions of \nagencies  and  employees  of the  Department  of Justice  are  vested  in  the  Attorney \nGeneral. .. \" (Section 509). The Attorney General has discretion in deciding whether the \nUnited  States is concerned in  particular civil  actions;  and the head  of any executive \ndepartment of the United States \"may require the opinion of the Attorney General on \nquestions of law arising in the administration of his department\" (Section 512). 28 U.S. \nCode ยง 516 reserves to the Department of Justice \"the conduct of litigation in which the \nUnited  States,  an  agency,  or officer thereof is  a party,  or is  interested ... \"  under the \ndirection of the Attorney General. This Defendant is sued in his official capacity. He has \nconfirmed his support and approval of the Federal Act of Congress that does not permit \nmarriages of same-sex couples or recognition of same by any State. \nTHE QUESTIONED ACT OF CONGRESS \n15.  In 1996, the Congress of the United States enacted into law The Defense of Marriage \nAct, 110 Stat. 2419 (1996), Title 28, Chapter 115, U.S. Code, Section 1738C and Chapter \n1 of Title 1, U.S. Code, Paragraph 7. A copy of the full Act is attached hereto as Exhibit \n\"A\" and should be considered a part of this Complaint. Basically, the Federal DOMA \ndefines marriage as \"only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and \nwife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband \nor a wife.\" This definition excludes Plaintiffs from federal rights and benefits including \nbut not limited to Social Security, family and medical leave, rights of survivorship, rights \nof visitation for medical reasons, the right to  file joint tax returns, certain evidentiary \nrights,  etc.  In  all,  the  U.S.  General  Accounting  Office  has  counted  1,138  statutory \nprovisions in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving \"benefits, rights \nand privileges.\" \nThis Act of Congress also requires any State not to give effect to any public act of any \nother State respecting a relationship, right or claim between persons of the  same  sex \ntreated as a marriage under the laws of such other State. And where federal programs set \nthe eligibility requirements for many federally funded State of Florida programs, those \n5 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 6 of 15 PageID 11\ncorresponding Florida programs will not be allowed to treat same-sex couples as married \neither; thus excluding them from (or profoundly affecting the calculation of) entitlement \nto  benefits under many  such Florida programs.  Florida officials  - - not just Federal \nofficials  will,  of necessity,  have  to  differentiate  between  same-sex  and  opposite-sex \ncouples for all of these Florida programs. \n16.  At present, Plaintiffs would not have access to Florida's courts for purposes of obtaining \na divorce or separation and the necessary orders (with respect to alimony, child support \nor child custody) that accompany a divorce or separation. \nTHE FLORIDA STATUTE \n17.  In 1997, the Florida legislature followed Congress' lead and adopted as law The Florida \nDefense of Marriage Act, Section 741.212 (1), (2) and (3), Florida Statutes, a copy of \nwhich  is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  \"B\"  and  should  be  considered  a  part  of this \nComplaint. F.S.  741.212 does not allow Florida to recognize or give effect to marriages \nbetween persons of the same-sex entered into in or outside of Florida, the United States \nof America or any other jurisdiction, either domestic or foreign. The Florida DOMA also \ntracks the Federal DOMA definition of \"marriage\" as \"only a legal union between one \nman and one woman as husband and wife ... \" Among the hundreds ofbenefits, rights and \nprivileges  granted to  different-sex  couples  who  marry  in  Florida  but  which  are  not \ngranted to same-sex couples who desire to marry in Florida or have a foreign marriage \nlicense recognized in Florida are: \nEqual rights and property acquired during the marriage, the right to \nhold property as  tenants by  the  entireties, the  right to  rehabilitative or \npermanent alimony in a proceeding for the dissolution of marriage, the \nright to an elective share in the estate of a deceased spouse, the right to \nenter  into  a  gestational  surrogacy,  distribution  rights  in  homestead \nproperty, legitimacy of children born out of wedlock upon the marriage of \nthe parents, etc. \nTHE ISSUES \n18.  The questions this Court is asked to consider are whether it is constitutional to create a \nseparate class of citizens by status and gender discrimination, withholding from that class \nthe right to participate, anywhere in the  world,  in the fundamental  institution of civil \n6 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 7 of 15 PageID 12\nmamage  with its  attendant protections.,  benefits  and  obligations;  AND  whether  it is \nconstitutional to deny any citizen of the United States the right of recognition of a valid \nand legal marriage license from one state, territory or country to another. \nPlaintiffs challenge this combination of the Act of Congress and the Florida Statute as a \nviolation of both their fundamental  rights and the Equal Protection and Due Process \nClauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as being a violation of the Full Faith and \nCredit Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clauses and the Commerce Clause of the \nConstitution of the United States. \nTHE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE \n\" .... No State shall .... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the \nequal protection of laws.\" United States Constitution, Amendment XIV, \nSection I. \n19.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  does  not  tolerate  unjustified  discrimination  against  a \ndisfavored class. The exclusion of lesbian and gay couples from marriage violates this \nmost  fundamental  and  basic  constitutional  guarantee  of equality  of privileges  and \nimmunities for all Americans. \nPlaintiffs urge that this Act of Congress and the Florida Statute make it more difficult, if \nnot impossible, for them than for all others to seek to be civilly married; that this is itself \na denial of equal protection in the most literal sense. \nA  bare  desire  to  harm  a  politically  unpopular  group  cannot  constitute  a  legitimate \ngovernment  interest;  the  Act of Congress  and  the  Florida  Statute  at  issue  raise  the \ninevitable inference that they were born of animosity toward the class that they were to \naffect.  The marriage ban works a deep and scarring hardship on a very real segment of \nthe  community  for  no  rational  reason.  The  absence  of any  reasonable  relationship \nbetween, on the one hand, an absolute disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to \nenter into civil marriage and, on the other, protection of public health, safety, or general \nwelfare, suggests that the marriage restriction is rooted in persistent prejudices against \npersons  who  are  (or who  are  believed to  be)  homosexual.  \"The Constitution  cannot \ncontrol such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the \nreach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\" \n20.  Plaintiffs  would  also  show  that  these  Statutes  are  a  \"status-based\"  classification  of \npersons undertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not \n7 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 8 of 15 PageID 13\npermit.  Plaintiffs,  solely  because  of their  sexual  orientation,  by  Federal  and  Florida \ndecree, are put in a solitary class with respect to transactions and relations in both the \nprivate and governmental spheres. \nCongress and Florida withdraw from homosexuals, BUT NO OTHERS, specific legal \nprotection from the injuries caused by discrimination. These Defendants have imposed a \nspecial disability upon the Plaintiffs alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards, \nbenefits and rights of civil marriage that others enjoy or may seek without constraint. \nThese Florida and  Federal Statutes not only lack a rational relationship to  legitimate \nFederal and  State interests,  but this classification also  was  drawn for the purpose  of \ndisadvantaging the group burdened by these laws. \n21.  Guaranteed to  all  people in this  country equally  is  the  enjoyment of rights  that  are \ndeemed important or fundamental. The withholding of relief from the Plaintiffs who wish \nto marry and are otherwise eligible to marry on the ground that the couples are of the \nsame gender constitutes a categorical restriction of a fundamental right. The restriction \ncreates a straight forward case of discrimination that disqualifies an entire group of our \ncitizens and their families from participation in an institution of paramount legal and \nsocial  importance  because  of their  sex  or  gender.  This  is  impermissible  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  already  struck  down  class-based  legislation  directed  at \nhomosexuals  as  a violation of the  Equal  Protection Clause.  \"We concluded  that  the \nprovision was 'born of animosity toward the class of persons affected' and further that is \nhad no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.\" \nBecause these questioned marriage statutes intend and state that marriage under our law \nconsists  only of a legal union between a man and a woman, they  create a statutory \nclassification  based  on  the  sex  of the  two  people  who  wish  to  marry.  That  the \nclassification is sex based is self-evident. As a factual matter, an individual's choice of a \nmarital partner is constrained because of his or her own sex. Only their gender prevents \nthe Plaintiffs from marrying their chosen partners under the present law.  By enacting \nthese questionable laws mandating that gays and lesbians shall not have any of the rights, \nbenefits and protections awarded to married heterosexuals, Defendants inflict on these \nPlaintiffs immediate, continuing, and real injuries that outrun and belie any legitimate \njustifications that may be claimed for  it.  Plaintiffs contend that these statutes classify \nhomosexuals,  not  to  further  a  proper  legislative  end,  but  to  make  them  unequal  to \neveryone else. The United States and Florida cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger \nto  its laws.  Moreover, the  substantive equal protection guarantees of the Constitution \n8 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 9 of 15 PageID 14\nprohibit  an  unjustifiable  burden  on  the  fundamental  right  to  equality  and  non \ndiscrimination.  The  failure  to  permit  marriages  of same-sex  couples  constitutes  an \nunjustified denial of a privilege based on sexual orientation and gender. \nThe  Act  of Congress  and  the  Florida  Statute  under consideration  violate  the  Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nDUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n\" .... ;nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property \nwithout due process oflaw. .. \" United States Constitution, Amendment \nXIV, Section I. \n22.  Because  civil  marriage  is  central  to  the  lives  of individuals  and  the  welfare  of the \ncommunity, our laws assiduously prote~t the individual's right to marry against undue \ngovernment incursion. \nThe United States Supreme Court has read into the Federal Constitution an implicit right \nof privacy, which includes the right to liberty and self-determination. That Court has also \nreaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. \"Our \nlaws  and  tradition  afford  constitutional  protection  to  personal  decisions  relating  to \nmarriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.\" \nIn explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in \nmaking these choices, the Supreme Court has held: \n\"These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person \nmay make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, \nare central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the \nheart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of \nmeaning, of the universe and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about \nthese  matters  could  not  define  the  attributes  of personhood  were  they \nformed under compulsion of the State.\" \n\"Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as \nheterosexual persons do.\" \nThe Defendants cannot show that their discriminatory laws bear a close relationship to \nthe promoting of a compelling state  interest or that the classification is  necessary to \nachieve the government's goal or that the classification is narrowly drawn to achieve the \ngoal by the least restrictive means possible - - all of which are required when, such as \n9 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 10 of 15 PageID 15\nhere, laws impinge on certain fundamental rights that will be subjected to strict judicial \nscrutiny and the presumption that such laws are unconstitutional. \nThe Plaintiffs' liberty, privacy and autonomy safeguards in the United States Constitution \nprotect both \"freedom from\" unwarranted government intrusion into protected spheres of \nlife and \"freedom to\" partake of benefits created by the State for the common good. Both \nfreedoms  are  involved  here.  Whether. and  whom  to  marry,  how  to  express  sexual \nintimacy, and whether and how to establish a family - -these are among the basics of \neveryone's liberty, privacy and self-determination due process rights. The liberty interest \nin choosing whether and whom to marry would be hollow if the State could foreclose an \nindividual from freely choosing the person with whom to share an exclusive commitment \nin the unique institution of civil marriage. The substantive due process guarantees of the \nConstitution prohibit an unjustifiable burden on the fundamental right to privacy, liberty \nand autonomy, including the fundamental right to enter into a civil marriage. \nThis Act of Congress and the  Florida Statute violate the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nTHE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE \n\"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, \nRecords,  and Judicial  Proceedings of every other State.\" United  States \nConstitution, Article IV, Section 1. \n23.  Plaintiffs urge this Court to compare this constitutional requirement with the wording and \nintent  of 28  United  States  Code  1738C,  which  mandates  that  \"No  State ... shall  be \nrequired to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceedings of any other \nState ... respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a \nmarriage under the laws of such other State ... , or a right or claim arising from  such \nrelationship.\"  And  Florida  Statute  7 41.212  (1)  also  bars  recognition  of same-sex \nmarriages from any other state and within Florida. \nThe  Constitution  clearly  mandates  that  the  public  Acts,  Records,  and  Judicial \nProceedings of each State SHALL be given FULL FAITH AND CREDIT by every other \nState. Congress and Florida, on the other hand, say NO!  The States SHALL NOT be \nrequired  to  give  FULL  FAITH  AND  CREDIT  to  those  Acts  respecting  same-sex \nmarriages.  This  is  a  conflict  that  should be  resolved  in  favor  of the  United  States \nConstitution. \n10 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 11 of 15 PageID 16\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause is an essential part of our federal system of government. \nThe drafters sought to transform several independent sovereign entities into one cohesive \nnation; \"it was clearly not to continue a relation of several, separate sovereign states with \n1\nvarious contradicting laws possessing no effect beyond each state's bordel. The Federal \nAct  under consideration here  is  beyond the  scope  of congressional legislative power \nbecause of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Each state has an interest in the marital status \nof those domiciled within the state. Once Massachusetts sanctioned legal same-gender \nmarriage, all other states should be constitutionally required to uphold the validity of the \nmamage. \nThe differentiation among the states (here, Massachusetts and Florida) is exactly what the \nFull Faith and Credit Clause was intended to prohibit. A valid marriage, hence a valid \nsame-gender marriage, should be given full faith and credit in every state in this country. \nPlaintiffs  would  urge  that not only would Massachusetts have  an  interest in  a valid \nmarriage performed within its jurisdiction, it may also determine the extraterritorial effect \nof its judgment. Therefore, if Massachusetts recognizes same-gender marriages with all \nthe legal rights, privileges and immunities of different-sex marriages, Florida should be \nobliged  to  recognize  the  full  scope  of  legal  rights  bestowed  upon  them  under \nMassachusetts law. \nThe  Florida Legislature,  in deciding  to  cancel  out,  overrule,  and  nullify  Article  IV, \nSection I by enacting Section 741.212, Florida Statutes, 1997, not only exempted every \nother State and itself from recognizing same-sex marriages, but also extends the ban to \n\"any other jurisdiction, either domestic  or foreign,  or any other place or location ... \" \nFlorida really wants to make sure; however, limiting the jurisdiction of State courts over \nout-of-state marriage relationships is a violation ofthis Clause. \nNo sister state has such an overriding valid interest in the Florida Statute or the Act of \nCongress  such  that  the  sister  state's  own  constitution  and  laws  can  be  ignored  by \nsurrendering jurisdiction, subject matter and fundamental due process to another State. \nThe  same-sex  prohibitions  in  question  constitute  infringement  of that  sister  state's \nsovereignty. \nNo out-of-state judicial proceedings can gain or exert jurisdiction over the Defendant \nAKE or any other Florida official in order for the other State to direct AKE to issue or not \nissue a marriage  license to  Floridians.  This Act  of Congress and  the  Florida Statute \nviolate the FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE ofthe United States Constitution. \n11 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 12 of 15 PageID 17\nTHE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSES \n24.  Attached  hereto  as  Collective Exhibit \"C\" are  the  Privileges and  Immunities  Clause \n(Article 4,  Section 2)  and the Commerce Clause (Article  1,  Section 8)  of the  United \nStates Constitution. Together with the Privileges and Immunities Clause found in Section \n1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, these three provisions of our organic law have been \ninterpreted by our highest court to make interstate travel a national concern that states \nmay not infringe on through diverse treatment ... \"a state law implicates the right to travel \nwhen it actually deters such travel... or when it uses 'any classification which serves to \npenalize the exercise of that right.\"' \nThe Act of Congress and the Florida Statute under question in this case implicates this \nright because these Plaintiffs who were legally married in Massachusetts were deterred \nfrom traveling to Florida. One of the reasons? If one of the parties to the marriage faces a \nmedical emergency, Florida would not recognize the other's legal right to make medical \ndecisions for her spouse. \nA state may not interfere with the constitutional right to interstate travel by denying legal \nrights to those who have recently moved. This Act of Congress and Florida Statute denies \nthe legally married Plaintiffs all of the legal rights, privileges and immunities normally \ngranted to a valid marriage. Plaintiffs would urge this Court to find, as the U.S. Supreme \nCourt  has  noted,  \"If a  law  has  'no  other  purpose  than  to  chill  the  assertion  of \nconstitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them, then it is patently \nunconstitutional.\"' Thus, this Act of Congress and Florida Statutes 74 1.212 are similarly \nunconstitutional. \nRELIEF SOUGHT \n25.  The refusal of the Defendant AKE to recognize and accept the valid and legal marriage \nlicense issued to the Plaintiffs by the State of Massachusetts and Congress' edict to not \nrecognize same-sex marriage in any State have left the Plaintiffs in doubt and uncertain \nabout their rights under said State and Federal Statutes; thus giving rise to a justiciable \ncontroversy and an  actual rather than a theoretical controversy as  to  the validity and \nconstitutionality ofthe Act of Congress and Florida Statute 741.212. \nThe  Defendants  contend  that  these  two  almost  identical  laws  are  constitutional; \nDefendant AKE has already enforced these statutes against these Plaintiffs and Defendant \n12 \n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 1    Filed 07/20/04   Page 13 of 15 PageID 18\nASHCROFT seeks to and has announced intentions to enforce these laws. Accordingly, \nan active justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between the Plaintiffs and the \nDefendants  concerning  their  respective  rights,  duties  and  responsibilities.  The \ncontroversy is definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of the parties. \nTitle  28  U.S.  Code  2201  and  Ru1e  57  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure \n(Declaratory  Judgments)  allow  this  Court  to  render  declaratory  judgments  on  the \nexistence or nonexistence of any immunity, power, privilege or right OR of any fact upon \nwhich the existence or nonexistence of such immunity, power, privilege or right does or \nmay depend; and when and where such immunity, power, privilege or right now exists or \nwill arise in the future. \nSection 2201  and Rule 57 also permits this Court to order a speedy hearing and may \nadvance it on the calendar. \n26.  Pursuant to F.S. 86.091 the State Attorney for the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit of Florida is \nbeing served with a copy of this Complaint so that he may be heard in this action. \nWHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows: \n1.

NANCY WILSON and\nDR. PAULA SCHOENWETHER,\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Case No.  8:04-cv-1680-T-30TBM          \nRICHARD L. AKE and\nJOHN ASHCROFT,\nDefendants.\n_____________________________________/  \nORDER\nTHIS CAUSE comes before the Court upon United States Attorney General John\nAshcroftโs Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. # 31), Memorandum in Support of United States\nAttorney General Ashcroftโs Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. # 39), and Plaintiffsโ Memorandum\nof Law in Opposition to the United States Attorney Generalโs Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. # 48).\nThe Court, having considered the Motion and Memoranda, and being otherwise fully\nadvised, finds that the Motion should be granted.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs Nancy Wilson and Paula Schoenwether allege that they are a lesbian couple\nwho reside together in the Middle District of Florida.  According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs\nwere legally married in the State of Massachusetts and possess a valid marriage license from\nthat State.  Plaintiffs allege that they personally presented their Massachusetts marriage\nlicense to a Deputy Clerk at the Clerk of the Circuit Courtโs Office in Hillsborough County,\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 2 of 18 PageID 378\nFlorida, asking for โacceptance of the valid and legal Massachusetts marriage license.โ\n(Complaint, ยถ 12).  Plaintiffs allege that โ[t]heir demand was refused by Defendant Ake,\nwhose Deputy Clerk stated that according to Federal and Florida law, the Clerk is not\nallowed to recognize, for marriage purposes, the Massachusetts marriage license, because\nFederal and Florida law prohibit such recognition.โ (Complaint, ยถ 12).  \nPlaintiffs have filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment asking this Court to\ndeclare the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (โDOMAโ), 1 U.S.C. ยง 7; 28 U.S.C. ยง 1738C,1\nand Florida Statutes ยง 741.212,2 unconstitutional and to enjoin their enforcement.  Plaintiffs\n1  The Defense of Marriage Act (โDOMAโ) provides:\nNo State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be\nrequired to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any\nother State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between\npersons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other\nState, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such\nrelationship. \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1738C.  \n* * * \nIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation,\nor interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United\nStates, the word \"marriage\" means only a legal union between one man and one\nwoman as husband and wife, and the word \"spouse\" refers only to a person of the\nopposite sex who is a husband or a wife. 1 U.S.C. ยง 7\n \n2 Florida Statutes ยง 741.212, Marriages between persons of the same sex, provides: \n(1) Marriages between persons of the same sex entered into in any jurisdiction,\nwhether within or outside the State of Florida, the United States, or any other\njurisdiction, either domestic or foreign, or any other place or location, or\nrelationships between persons of the same sex which are treated as marriages in\nany jurisdiction, whether within or outside the State of Florida, the United States,\n(continued...)\nPage 2 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 3 of 18 PageID 379\nhave sued, in their official capacities, Richard L. Ake, Clerk of the Circuit Court in\nHillsborough County, Florida, and United States Attorney General John Ashcroft.3    \nPlaintiffs allege that the two statutes violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Due\nProcess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause of the United\nStates Constitution.  \nPlaintiffs assert that Florida is required to recognize Plaintiffsโ valid Massachusetts\nmarriage license because DOMA exceeds Congressโ power under the Full Faith and Credit\nClause.  Plaintiffs also argue that twelve United States Supreme Court cases (which Plaintiffs\nlabel โThe Dynamite Dozenโ), beginning with Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483\n(1954), and ending with Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), demonstrate a recent trend\n2(...continued)\nor any other jurisdiction, either domestic or foreign, or any other place or\nlocation, are not recognized for any purpose in this state.\n(2) The state, its agencies, and its political subdivisions may not give effect to any\npublic act, record, or judicial proceeding of any state, territory, possession, or\ntribe of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, either domestic or foreign,\nor any other place or location respecting either a marriage or relationship not\nrecognized under subsection (1) or a claim arising from such a marriage or\nrelationship.\n(3) For purposes of interpreting any state statute or rule, the term \"marriage\"\nmeans only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife,\nand the term \"spouse\" applies only to a member of such a union.\n3  Pursuant to Florida Statutes ยง 741.01(1), marriage licenses are issued by a county court\njudge or Clerk of the Circuit Court.\nPage 3 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 4 of 18 PageID 380\nby  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  to  expand  โthe  fundamental  liberty  of  personal\nautonomy in connection with oneโs intimate affairs and family relations.โ (Plaintiffsโ\nMemorandum of Law in Opposition (Dkt. # 48), p. 11).  Plaintiffs urge this Court to expand\non โThe Dynamite Dozenโ by finding that the right to enter into a same-sex marriage is\nprotected by the Constitution.  \nDefendant Ashcroft has moved to dismiss Plaintiffsโ Complaint pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted.4  The United States, in a well-written Memorandum, argues that\nPlaintiffsโ Complaint is barred as a matter of law because DOMA does not infringe on any\nof Plaintiffsโ fundamental rights and is a legitimate exercise of the power granted to Congress\nby the Full Faith and Credit Clause. 5  \nMOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\nA complaint should not be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \"unless it appears\nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim.\"  Bracewell\nv. Nicholson Air Services, Inc., 680 F.2d 103, 104 (11th Cir. 1982); see also Rickman v.\nPrecisionaire, Inc., 902 F.Supp. 232, 233 (M.D. Fla. 1995) (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355\nU.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  For Rule 12(b)6 purposes, the court considers as part of the complaint\nany written instrument filed with it as an exhibit.   See Rule 10(c) Fed. R. Civ. P. (โA copy\n4 Defendant Ake filed an Answer and Defenses (Dkt. # 12) to Plaintiffsโ Complaint on\nAugust 4, 2004, and an Amended Answer and Defenses (Dkt. # 13) on August 10, 2004.  \n5  Defendant Ashcroft only moves to dismiss Plaintiffsโ claim that DOMA is unconstitutional\nand does not address the validity of Florida Statutes ยง 741.212.\nPage 4 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 5 of 18 PageID 381\nof any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all\npurposes.โ).  In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court must accept plaintiff's well-pleaded\nfacts as true, and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  See\nQuality Foods de Centro Am., S.A. v. Latin Am. Agribusiness Devel. Corp., 711 F.2d 989,\n994-95 (11th Cir. 1983); Rickman, 902 F.Supp. at 233 (citing Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S.\n232 (1974)).  Regardless of the alleged facts, however, a court may dismiss a complaint on\na dispositive issue of law.  Marshall Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Marshall Cty. Gas District, 992 F.2d\n1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 1993);  Hunt v. American Bank & Trust Co., 783 F.2d 1011, 1013\n(11th Cir. 1986).  \nFULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE\nPlaintiffsโ Complaint asserts that DOMA conflicts with the Constitutionโs Full Faith\nand Credit Clause.  Article IV, Section I of the Constitution provides:\nFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records,\nand Judicial Proceedings of every other State; And the Congress may by\ngeneral  Laws  prescribe  the  Manner  in  which  such  Acts,  Records  and\nProceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. \nPlaintiffs argue that โ[o]nce Massachusetts sanctioned legal same-gender marriage,\nall other states should be constitutionally required to uphold the validity of the marriage.โ\n(Complaint, ยถ 23).  Plaintiffs believe that the differences in individualsโ rights to enter into\nsame-sex marriages among the States, such as Florida and Massachusetts, is exactly what the\nFull Faith and Credit Clause prohibits.  They also assert that DOMA is beyond the scope of\nPage 5 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 6 of 18 PageID 382\nCongressโ legislative power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause  because Congress may\nonly regulate what effect a law may have, it may not dictate that the law has no effect at all.\nThis Court disagrees with Plaintiffโs interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\nCongressโ actions in adopting DOMA are exactly what the Framers envisioned when they\ncreated the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  DOMA is an example of Congress exercising its\npowers under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to determine the effect that โany public act,\nrecord, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a\nrelationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriageโ has on the other\nStates. 28 U.S.C. ยง1738C.  Congressโ actions are an appropriate exercise of its power to\nregulate conflicts between the laws of two different States, in this case, conflicts over the\nvalidity of same-sex marriages.   \nAdopting Plaintiffsโ rigid and literal interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit would\ncreate a license for a single State to create national policy.  See Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410,\n423-24 (1979)(โFull Faith and Credit does not . . . enable one state to legislate for the other\nor to project its laws across state lines so as to preclude the other from prescribing for itself\nthe legal consequences of acts within it.โ)(quoting Pacific Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident\nCommโn, 306 U.S. 493, 505-06 (1939)); Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 296\n(1942) (โNor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and\ncredit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as\nrespects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.โ).  The Supreme Court has clearly\nestablished that โthe Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to apply another\nPage 6 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 7 of 18 PageID 383\nStateโs law in violation of its own legitimate public policy.โ  Hall, 440 U.S. at 422 (citing\nPacific  Ins.  Co,  306  U.S.  at  493).    Florida  is  not  required  to  recognize  or  apply\nMassachusettsโ same-sex marriage law because it clearly conflicts with Floridaโs legitimate\npublic policy of opposing same-sex marriage. See infra pp. 9-18; Fla. Stat. ยง 741.212.6  \nBAKER v. NELSON\nThe United States argues that this Court is bound by the United States Supreme\nCourtโs decision in Baker v. Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971), appeal\ndismissed, 409 U.S. 810 (1972).  In Baker v. Nelson, two adult malesโ application for a\nmarriage license was denied by the Clerk of the Hennepin County District Court because the\npetitioners were of the same sex.  The plaintiffs, following the quashing of a writ of\nmandamus directing the clerk to issue a marriage license, appealed to the Minnesota Supreme\nCourt. Id. at 311, 191 N.W.2d at 185.  Plaintiffs argued that Minnesota Statute ยง 517.08,\nwhich did not authorize marriage between persons of the same sex, violated the First, Eighth,\nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Id. at 312, 191 N.W.2d\nat 186.  The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected plaintiffsโ assertion that โthe right to marry\nwithout regard to the sex of the parties is a fundamental right of all personsโ and held that\nยง 517.08 did not violate the Due Process Clause or Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 312-15,\n191 N.W.2d at 186-87. \n6  Under Plaintiffsโ interpretation of the clause, a single State could mandate that all the\nStates recognize bigamy, polygamy, marriages between blood relatives or marriages involving minor\nchildren.   \nPage 7 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 8 of 18 PageID 384\nThe plaintiffs then appealed the Minnesota Supreme Courtโs ruling to the United\nStates Supreme Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1257(2).7  Under 28 U.S.C. 1257(2), the\nSupreme Court had no discretion to refuse to adjudicate the case on its merits. Hicks v.\nMiranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344 (1975).  The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal โfor want of\na substantial federal question.โ Baker, 409 U.S. at 810.  \nPlaintiffs assert that Baker v. Nelson is not binding upon this Court because the\nSupreme Court did not issue a written opinion and because the case was decided thirty-two\n(32) years ago, before the โcurrent civil rights revolution.โ (Plaintiffsโ Memorandum of Law\nin Opposition (Dkt. #48), pp. 9-10).  This Court disagrees.  A dismissal for lack of a\nsubstantial federal question constitutes an adjudication on the merits that is binding on lower\nfederal courts. See Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344.  As Justice White noted, the Court was โnot\nobligated to grant the case plenary consideration . . . but [the Court was] required to deal with\nits merits. Id; see also Ohio ex rel. Eaton v. Price, 360 U.S. 246, 247 (1959) (โ(v)otes to\naffirm summarily, and to dismiss for want of a substantial federal question, it hardly needs\ncomment, are votes on the merits of a case . . .โ).  \n7 At the time, 28 U.S.C. 1257(2) provided:\nFinal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a\ndecision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court as follows:\n(2) [b]y appeal, where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on\nthe  ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United\nStates,  and the decision is in favor of its validity.  \nThis appeal as of right was eliminated by the Supreme Court Case Selections Act (Public\nLaw 100-352), which became law on June 27, 1988.  \nPage 8 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 9 of 18 PageID 385\nAlthough Baker v. Nelson is over thirty (30) years old, the decision addressed the\nsame issues presented in this action and this Court is bound to follow the Supreme Courtโs\ndecision.  See Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344-45 (โlower courts are bound by summary decision by\nthis Court โuntil such time as the Court informs (them) that (they) are not.โ)(quoting Doe v.\nHodgson, 478 F.2d 537, 539 (2d Cir. 1973)); see also McConnell v. Nooner, 547 F.2d 54,\n55-56 (8th Cir. 1976); Adams v. Howerton, 486 F.Supp. 1119, 1124 (C.D.Cal. 1980), affโd\n673 F.2d 1036, 1039 n.2 (9th Cir. 1982).  \nThe Supreme Courtโs holding in Lawrence does not alter the dispositive effect of\nBaker. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 207 (1997) (โThe Court neither acknowledges\nnor holds that other courts should ever conclude that its more recent cases have, by\nimplication, overruled an earlier precedent.โ);  Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American\nExpress, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (โIf a precedent of this Court has direct application\nin a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of\nAppeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative\nof overruling its own decision.).  The Supreme Court has not explicitly or implicitly\noverturned its holding in Baker or provided the lower courts, including this Court, with any\nreason to believe that the holding is invalid today.8  Accordingly, Baker v. Nelson is binding\nprecedent upon this Court and Plaintiffsโ case against Attorney General Ashcroft must be\ndismissed.  \n8 This Court disagreeโs with the holding in In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 138 (W.D.Wash.\n2004), that Baker is not binding precedent.\nPage 9 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 10 of 18 PageID 386\nDUE PROCESS\nRecent Eleventh Circuit precedent also constrain this Court to rule contrary to\nPlaintiffsโ position.  Plaintiffs argue that their right to marry someone of the same sex is a\nfundamental right that is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause.9\nIf Plaintiffsโ have a fundamental right to enter into a same-sex marriage, then this Court must\napply a โโstrict scrutinyโ analysis that forbids government infringement on a fundamental\nliberty interest โunless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\ninterest.โโ In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 138 (W.D.Wash. 2004)(quoting Washington v.\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997)).  If the right to marry someone of the same sex is not\na fundamental right, then the Court will apply the more liberal rational basis analysis in\ndetermining whether DOMA is constitutional.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 728.\nThe Supreme Court has defined fundamental rights as those liberties that are โimplicit\nin the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were\nsacrificed.โ Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325-\n26 (1937)).  The Court observed that the Due Process clause โspecially protects those\nfundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, โdeeply rooted in this Nationโs\nhistory and tradition.โโ Glucksberg, 720-21 (quoting Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494,\n503 (1977)(plurality opinion)).\n9  The Court notes that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the states and not the\nfederal government.  Plaintiffsโ claim should have been brought pursuant to the Due Process Clause\nof the Fifth Amendment.\nPage 10 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 11 of 18 PageID 387\nAlthough  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  marriage  is  a  fundamental  right,\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720, no federal court has recognized that this right includes the right\nto marry a person of the same sex.  See Kandu, 315 B.R. at 139; Standhardt v. Superior Court\nof Arizona, 206 Ariz. 276, 281, 77 P.3d 451, 456 (2003).  Plaintiffs urge this Court to\ninterpret the Supreme Courtโs decision in Lawrence v. Texas as establishing a fundamental\nright  to  private  sexual  intimacy.    Plaintiffs  argue  that  this  Court  should  expand  the\nfundamental right recognized in Lawrence to include same-sex marriages.\nIn Lawrence, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute that criminalized private\nsexual conduct between consenting adults of the same sex. 539 U.S. at 578-79.   The Court\nfound that the statute could not stand under rational review because it did not further a\nlegitimate state interest that justified the intrusion into the personal lives of homosexuals.\nId.    \n  But the Supreme Courtโs decision in Lawrence cannot be interpreted as creating a\nfundamental right to same-sex marriage.  First, the Eleventh Circuit disagrees with Plaintiffsโ\nassertion that Lawrence created a fundamental right in private sexual intimacy and this Court\nmust follow the holdings of the Eleventh Circuit.  See Lofton v. Sec. of Dept. of Children and\nFamily Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 817 (11th Cir.), rehโg en banc denied by, 377 F.3d 1275 (2004),\nand cert. denied, 543 U.S. ___ (2005) (โWe conclude that it is a strained and ultimately\nincorrect reading of Lawrence to interpret it to announce a new fundamental right.โ);\nWilliams v. Pryor, 378 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir. 2004); see also Standhardt, 206 Ariz. at\n281-82, 77 P.3d at 456-57.  The Court in Lawrence did not find private sexual conduct\nPage 11 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 12 of 18 PageID 388\nbetween consenting adults to be a fundamental right. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 586 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting) (โnowhere does the Courtโs opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a\nโfundamental rightโ under the Due Process Clause; nor does it subject the Texas law to the\nstandard of review that would be appropriate (strict scrutiny) if homosexual sodomy were\na โfundamental right.โโ). Rather, the Court determined that the Texas statute failed under the\nrational basis analysis.  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578-79.  \nSecond, the majority in Lawrence was explicitly clear that its holding did not extend\nto the issue of same-sex marriage, stating that the case โdoes not involve whether the\ngovernment must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek\nto enter.โ Lawrence 539 U.S. at 578; see also Standhardt, 206 Ariz. at 282, 77 P.3d at 457\n(โIf the Court did not view such an intimate expression of the bond securing a homosexual\nrelationship to be a fundamental right, we must reject any notion that the Court intended to\nconfer such status on the right to secure state-sanctioned recognition of such a union.โ).  It\nis disingenuous to argue that the Supreme Courtโs precise language in Lawrence established\na fundamental right to enter into a same-sex marriage.    \nMoreover, this Court is not inclined to elevate the ability to marry someone of the\nsame sex to a fundamental right.  Although the Court recognizes the importance of a\nheterosexual or homosexual individualโs choice of a partner, not all important decisions are\nprotected fundamental rights.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 727-28.   The Supreme Court has\ncautioned against the dangers of establishing new fundamental rights:\nPage 12 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 13 of 18 PageID 389\nBy extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest,\nwe, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and\nlegislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are\nasked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due\nProcess Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the\nmembers of this Court.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720.\nThe Eleventh Circuit has also noted that once a right is elevated to a fundamental\nright,  it  is  โeffectively  removed  from  the  hands  of  the  people  and  placed  into  the\nguardianship of unelected judges. We are particularly mindful of this fact in the delicate area\nof morals legislation.โ Williams, 378 F.3d at 1250 (internal citations omitted).  โOf course,\nthe Court may in due course expand Lawrenceโs precedent . . . [b]ut for us preemptively to\ntake that step would exceed our mandate as a lower court.โ Williams, 378 F.3d at 1238; see\nalso Lofton, 358 F.3d at 827 (the โlegislature is the proper forum for this debate, and we do\nnot sit as a superlegislature โto award by judicial decree what was not achievable by political\nconsensus.โโ) (quoting Thomasson v. Perry, 80 F.3d 915, 923 (4th Cir. 1996)).10  Therefore,\nthe Court finds that the right to marry a person of the same sex is not a fundamental right\nunder the Constitution.  \nEQUAL PROTECTION\n10 The Court also rejects Plaintiffโs argument that โ[s]anctioning same-sex sex and then not\nallowing a formal same-sex marriage based on love and commitment is illogical and incongruous.โ\n(Plaintiffsโ Memorandum of Law in Opposition (Dkt. # 48), p. 8).  Plaintiffsโ argument is flawed\nbecause the Supreme Court did not sanction homosexual sex in Lawrence, rather the Court merely\nheld that Texas could not criminalize private sexual conduct between consenting adults of the same\nsex.  The Eleventh Circuit has noted that there is a distinct difference between protecting the right\nto engage in private conduct without facing criminal sanctions and the โaffirmative right to receive\nofficial and public recognition.โ  Lofton, 358 F.3d at 817.\nPage 13 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 14 of 18 PageID 390\nPlaintiffs also argue that this Court should apply strict scrutiny in determining the\nconstitutionality of DOMA because it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.11  The Eleventh Circuit has held that homosexuality is not a suspect class that\nwould require subjecting DOMA to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment or the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendmentโs Due\nProcess Clause.  See Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818 (holding that homosexuality is not a suspect\nclass and noting that โall of our sister circuits that have considered the question have declined\nto treat homosexuals as a suspect class.โ); see also Kandu, 315 B.R. at 144 (Lawrence โdid\nnot hold that same-sex couples constitute a suspect or semi-suspect class under an equal\nprotection analysisโ) Moreover, DOMA does not discriminate on the basis of sex because\nit treats women and men equally.  Kandu, 315 B.R. at 143 (โ. . . DOMA does not classify\naccording to gender, and the Debtor is not entitled to heightened scrutiny under this\ntheory.โ).  Therefore this Court must apply rational basis review to its equal protection\nanalysis of the constitutionality of DOMA. \nRATIONAL BASIS REVIEW\nAs the Court noted above, because Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to enter\ninto a same-sex marriage and because DOMA does not create a suspect classification, the\nconstitutionality of DOMA is reviewed under the rational basis test.  Under rational basis\n11  The Court again notes that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the states and that\nPlaintiffsโ equal protection claims should have been brought pursuant to the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Kandu, 315 B.R. at 141-42.\nPage 14 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 15 of 18 PageID 391\nreview, this Court must determine whether the challenged legislation is rationally related to\na legitimate state interest.  See Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818 (citing Heller v. Doe, 50 U.S. 307,\n313-14 (1993)).  โIn areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that\nneither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be\nupheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts\nthat could provide a rational basis for the classification.โ  FCC v. Beach Communications,\nInc., 580 U.S. 307, 313 (1993).  Rational basis review is โvery deferential to the legislature,\nand does not permit this Court to interject or substitute its own personal views of DOMA or\nsame-sex marriage.โ Kandu at 145.  This presumption of validity remains true โeven if the\nlaw seems unwise or works to the disadvantage of a particular group, or if the rationale for\nit seems tenuous.โ Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818 (quoting Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632\n(1996)).  \nThe burden in on the Plaintiffs to negate โevery conceivable basis which might\nsupport [the legislation], whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.โ Id. at 818,\n(quoting Heller 50 U.S. at 320-21).  The United States has โno obligation to produce\nevidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.โ Id. (quoting Heller, 50 U.S.\nat 320).  โA statutory classification fails rational-basis review only when it โrests on grounds\nwholly irrelevant to the achievement of the Stateโs objective.โโ Heller, 50 U.S. at 324\n(quoting Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 71 (1978)).  \nThe  United  States  asserts  that  DOMA  is  rationally  related  to  two  legitimate\ngovernmental interests. First, the government argues that DOMA fosters the development of\nPage 15 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 16 of 18 PageID 392\nrelationships that are optimal for procreation, thereby encouraging the โstable generational\ncontinuity of the United States.โ (Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. # 39),\npp.  15-16).    DOMA  allegedly  furthers  this  interest  by  permitting  the  states  to  deny\nrecognition to same-sex marriages performed elsewhere and by adopting the traditional\ndefinition of marriage for purposes of federal statutes.  Second, DOMA โencourage[s] the\ncreation of stable relationships that facilitate the rearing of children by both of their\nbiological parents.โ (Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. # 39), pp. 15-16).\nThe government argues that these stable relationships encourage the creation of stable\nfamilies that are well suited to nurturing and raising children.    \nPlaintiffs offer little to rebut the governmentโs argument that DOMA is rationally\nrelated to the governmentโs proffered legitimate interests.  Rather, Plaintiffs repeatedly urge\nthe Court to apply the more rigid strict scrutiny analysis.  \nAlthough this Court does not express an opinion on the validity of the governmentโs\nproffered legitimate interests, it is bound by the Eleventh Circuitโs holding that encouraging\nthe raising of children in homes consisting of a married mother and father is a legitimate state\ninterest.  See Lofton, 358 F.3d at 819-20.  DOMA is rationally related to this interest.\nMoreover, Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy their burden of establishing that DOMA fails\nPage 16 of  18\n\nCase 8:04-cv-01680-JSM-TBM   Document 59    Filed 01/19/05   Page 17 of 18 PageID 393\nrational  basis  review.  See  Lofton,  358  F.3d  at  818-19;  Kandu,  315  B.R.  at  148.12\nAccordingly, the United Statesโ motion to dismiss is granted.13  \nCONCLUSION\nIn short, Plaintiffsโ argument is that, given their recent โcivil rights revolution,โ the\nUnited States Supreme Court is likely to declare that same-sex marriage is a fundamental\nright that is protected by the Constitution.  Plaintiffs are asking this Court to create such a\nfundamental right immediately, before the Supreme Court revisits the issue of same-sex\nmarriage.  But that is not this Courtโs role.  This Court is bound to follow the precedent\nestablished by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court.\nNone of their precedent acknowledge or establish a constitutional right to enter into a same-\nsex marriage.  The legislatures of the individual states may decide to permit same-sex\nmarriage or the Supreme Court may decide to overturn its precedent and strike down DOMA.\nBut, until then, this Court is constrained to hold DOMA and Florida Statutes ยง 741.212\nconstitutionally valid.  \nIt is therefore ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:\n12 Moreover, despite Justice Scaliaโs fears in Lawrence, the Eleventh Circuit has recently\nreiterated that the โfurtherance of public morality [is] a legitimate state interest.โ  Williams, 378 F.3d\nat 1238 n.8.  โOne would expect the Supreme Court to be manifestly more specific and articulate\nthan it was in Lawrence if now such a traditional and significant jurisprudential principal has been\njettisoned wholesale (with all due respect to Justice Scaliaโs ominous dissent notwithstanding). Id.\n13  The Court also finds that Plaintiffsโ arguments that DOMA violates the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause and the Commerce Clause are without merit.  See Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489,\n500 (1999); C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 511 U.S. 383, 402 (1994); Nehme\nv.
