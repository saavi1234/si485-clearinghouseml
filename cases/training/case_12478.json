    "summary": "<p>On February 22, 2012, twenty-one university students and recent graduates filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California against the Regents of the University of California (the Chancellor was Katehi, hence the case caption) and against members of the campus police.  The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief; declaratory relief; compensatory, punitive, exemplary, and statutory damages; and attorney's fees.  They alleged a violation of the First Amendment (freedom of speech and assembly), the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure), and the Fourteenth Amendment (taking property without due process of law).  Plaintiffs also alleged violations of corresponding provisions of the California Constitution, and also of § 836(a) of the California Penal Code (false arrest/imprisonment); § 52.1 of the California Civil Code; and § 845.6 of the California Government Code (failure to provide medical care to the protesters). </p><p>The events giving rise to the lawsuit occurred on November 18, 2011.  University of California at Davis students in the campus quad engaged in a nonviolent protest against university privatization, distribution of resources, tuition hikes, police brutality, and other policies adopted by the University administration and the Board of Regents.  The students set up tents and met to \"occupy the quad\" (modeled after the \"Occupy Wallstreet\" movement).  On the afternoon of November 18, the police chief delivered a letter from the Chancellor directing students to remove the tents, but they decided to continue their protest. Campus police then allegedly arrested students without probable cause and shot high-concentration pepper spray directly into their faces.  These actions were recorded on video and circulated nationally.  Nineteen of the plaintiffs were university students at the time of the incident and two were recent graduates.</p><p>On March 14, 2012, the Court approved an extension of time so that the parties could explore settlement.  On August 15 and 16, 2012, the parties engaged in mediation (before the Ret. Hon. Raul Ramirez) and reached an agreement.  They filed this settlement with the Court on September 26, 2012.  The defendants agreed to pay $630,000 to the plaintiffs ($30,000 per named plaintiff).  Defendants also agreed to pay $20,000 to each additional class member whose claim was approved, with the total damages for the class members capped at $100,000.  Defendants also agreed that for two years they would provide the ACLU attorneys with an opportunity to review, comment, and provide input on the Davis campus' written policies about the use of force by police, the handling of student demonstrations, and crowd control (and would pay attorneys' fees for their time).  The Chancellor also agreed to give a personal, written apology to each of the plaintiffs and to any class members who submit an approved claim form.  Further, the settlement stated that a student affairs representative would provide academic assistance and counseling to any plaintiffs and class members who need such assistance as a result of the incident.  The settlement also included $250,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. </p><p>The proposed settlement defined the class as: \"All persons who were arrested or directly sprayed with pepper spray by police officers working for or on the behalf of the University of California, Davis Police Department on November 18,2011, on the area known as \"the Quad,\" on the University of California, Davis campus.\"</p><p>On September 27, 2012, the Court (Judge John A. Mendez) granted preliminary approval of the parties' proposed settlement, certified the settlement class, approved class notice, and scheduled the final approval hearing.  </p><p>On January 9, 2013, the Court (Judge Mendez) approved the settlement. </p><p>There has been no further litigation and the case is now closed. </p>",

In August, the parties reached a settlement agreement.  This agreement provided for damages; for ACLU review of university policies for two years; for a written apology; for academic and counseling support to the plaintiffs; and for attorneys' fees.  On January 9, 2013, the Court approved of both the settlement class and the substance of the settlement.",

Their protest was an integral part of \n11 \ncontinuing, vigorous assembly and free speech activities which had been conducted by students for \n12 \nweeks at the same time the nationwide Occupy Wall Street movement mobilized thousands nationwide. \n13 \nNineteen of the named plaintiffs were u.c. Davis students at the time; the other two were recent \n14 \ngraduates. \n15 \nThis action seeks the following relief: a declaration from the Court that campus policies and \n16 \npractices that led to the abuse of the plaintiffs and others offend both the state and federal constitutional \n17 \nguarantees of the rights to free speech and assembly and that the pepper-spraying and arrests of plaintiffs \n18 \nviolated their state and federal constitutional rights; an injunction to prevent repetition of such a response \n19 \nto a non-violent protest; and compensatory and punitive damages against the individual perpetrators of \n20 \nthe illegal acts and their superiors who ordered, directed and/or condoned this outrageous conduct. \n21 \nI.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22 \n1.  Because this civil-rights action arises under the United States Constitution, this Court has \n23 \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and, 1343(a)(3), (4).  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over \n24 \nthe state-law claims under 28 U.S.c. § 1367. \n25 \n26  2.  At all times pertinent to this Complaint and in taking all of the actions described in this \n27  Complaint, Defendant, THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (hereinafter \n28  sometimes referred to as \"THE REGENTS\" or \"REGENTS\")  and those operating under their direction \n2 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et al. vs. Regents 0/ the University o/California; United States District Court, Eastern District of Calif omi a, Case No.2: 12-CV-004S0-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 3 of 21\n1 \nand control, acted and threatened to act under color of state law. \n2 \n3.

STATEMENT OF FACTS \n3 \n36.  On November 16, D.C. Davis students joined others in San Francisco to demonstrate at a \n4 \nscheduled Board of Regents meeting, protesting university privatization, tuition increases, and the brutal \n5 \ntreatment of demonstrators on Berkeley's campus the previous week.  They returned to campus and, on \n6 \nNovember 17, a general assembly of students agreed to set up symbolic tents on the quad and to continue \n7 \nto meet openly, to \"occupy the quad\" to discuss and study university privatization, tuition hikes, and their \n8 \nrelation to other issues of macro political and social importance, and to consider what they could do to \n9 \nchange conditions which had brought people together in support of the Occupy Wall Street Movement. \n10 \n37.  A group of students set up tents on the quad and the \"Occupation of the Quad\" began. \n11 \nShortly after the first tents were erected, D.C. Davis administrative employees delivered to some of the \n12 \nstudents on the quad a notice that included a campus \"no overnight camping\" policy. The notice was \n13 \ndiscussed and the group concluded that they were symbolically \"occupying the quad\" in support of and \n14 \nin solidarity with the 99% championed by the Occupy Wall Street movement. \n15 \n16  38.  On the evening of November 17, the Associated Students of the University of California \n17  at Davis (ASUCD) endorsed the \"occupation of the quad,\" \n18 \n39.  On November 18, in the afternoon,  Police Chief SPICUZZZA, accompanied by another \n19 \ncampus agent or employee, delivered a letter from Chancellor KAT  EHI directing students to remove the \n20 \ntents by 3:00 p.m. \"in interest of safety, respect for our campus environment and in accordance with our \n21 \nPrinciples of Community.\" \n22 \n40.  Students held another assembly, discussed the letter the Chancellor had delivered, and \n23 \nmany decided to remove their tents and did so.  Others resolved to remain. \n24 \n41.  Shortly before 3 :00 p.m., a large number of police in riot gear armed with long batons, \n25 \npepper-ball guns and other weapons were seen massing in formation adjacent to the quad.  The students \n26 \nmoved the remaining tents to the circle on the Centennial Walk, a concrete pathway in the middle of the \n27 \ncampus quad, and stood around them. \n28 \n8 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et al. vs. Regents oft he University qfCalifornia; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No.2: 12-CV -OO450-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 9 of 21\n1 \n42,  The officers advanced on the students as can be seen on any number of videotapes,  They \n2 \nbegan pushing students away, or throwing them to the ground, Some of the officers disassembled or \n3 \ndestroyed the tents.  As the tents were being removed, students sat down in a large circle.  Classes were \n4 \nletting out and hundreds of additional students swarmed out of their buildings to watch what was \n5 \nhappening. \n6 \n43.  The campus officers pointed to specific students, arrested them and began grabbing them \n7 \nand hauling them off to jail.  Plaintiff BAKER was the first to be grabbed and thrown to the ground by \n8 \ntwo police officers.  He hit his head on a sprinkler fixture as he was thrown to the ground and his hands \n9 \n10  were tightly zip tied together behind his back as he was taken into custody and placed into a police car. \n11  44.  Plaintiff PARKER was targeted by three police officers and grabbed.  His hands were \n12  painfully zip tied behind his back, exacerbating a prior military combat injury, and he was placed into a \n13  police car where he joined plaintiff BAKER and plaintiff LARA. \n14 \n45.  Plaintiff LARA had arrived immediately prior to the police advancing on those students \n15 \nstanding around the circle and joined the circle.  When the police reached the crowd she was thrown to \n16 \nthe ground by police officers, her hands were zip tied behind her, and she was arrested and taken to the \n17 \npolice car which then transported her, PARKER and BAKER to the police station. Plaintiffs' hands were \n18 \nall zip tied, some zip ties were particularly tight, cutting offblood flow, but the jailers did not have the \n19 \nspecial equipment needed to cut the plastic ties.  Eventually, the zip ties were cut and removed. \n20 \n46.  When the officers started to encircle the group of protesters, Plaintiff COOK was tapped \n21 \non the head by an officer who instructed other officers to \"take her.\"  She was pushed to the ground by an \n22 \nofficer, her arms were bent behind her back and zip-tie restraints were applied to her hands.  She was left \n23 \nlying on the ground for a few minutes before being placed in a vehicle and transported to the campus \n24 \npolice station. \n25 \n47.  As the group of students was being pushed by officers, students began to sit down in a \n26 \nline.  Officers were stepping over the seated students, who did nothing to stop them. Then PIKE ordered \n27 \nthe students to leave or stated they would be \"shot.\" As is discernible from audio tapes of his reaction, \n28 \n9 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et al. vs. Regents oft he University ofC ali fomi a; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No, 2:12-CV-004S0-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 10 of 21\n1 \nPlaintiff WHEATLEY responded: \"You're going to shoot us if we don't leave?\" \n2 \n48.  PIKE then shook a canister of pepper spray like a can of aerosol paint, stepped over the \n3 \nline of sitting, crouching students and walked up and down the line repeatedly dousing Plaintiffs with \n4 \norange colored pepper spray, mostly from a distance of one-to-two feet.  Students watching the scene \n5 \nscreamed or shouted: \"Shame.\" \n6 \n7  49.  Another officer, ALEXANDER LEE, then approached the line of seated demonstrators \n8  from behind and began spraying them with a separate canister of pepper spray.  On information and \n9  belief, LEE was ordered to do so by PIKE. \n10 \n50.  Documents that the University of California has subsequently released in response to a \n11 \nrequest for public records indicate that the substance used was Defense Technology's MK-9 Magnum \n12 \nspray, with a major Capsaicinoid concentration of .7%.  The single page of manufacturer's information \n13 \nthat the University was able to provide states that the minimum recommended distance for this \n14 \nformulation is 6 feet.  The University states that it has no other package inserts, warnings, or instructions \n15 \nrelating to this product, although California law requires that all such substances sold in California be \n16 \naccompanied by printed instructions for use, first aid information, and safety information.  See Cal. Penal \n17 \nCode § 2281O(e)(4), (f) (former § 12403.7). \n18 \n51.  PlaintiffMATZAr's hands were zip-tied behind his back and he was arrested along with \n19 \nPlaintiff WHEATLEY who had been pepper-sprayed and both had been transferred to jail by several \n20 \ncampus police officers. \n21 \n52.  Plaintiffs BUSCHO, FETTERMAN, GROSSJAN, JOHNSON, KAMRAN, IAN LEE, \n22 \nSOO LEE, LOKER, ROBERTS, SBEIH, WHALEY- MAYDA, WILDANGER and CLASS MEMBERS \n23 \nwere pepper sprayed by PIKE, LEE, and other officers and left to deal with their burning eyes, faces and \n24 \nskin.  Neither the University nor the police provided adequate medical attention on the scene to any of \n25 \nthe students who had been sprayed. \n26 \n27  53.  Members of the campus student body administered first aid to Plaintiffs who could not see \n28  and were disoriented.  PlaintiffWHALEY-MAY  DA was transported by ambulance to the hospital where \n10 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker. et at. vs. Regents o/the University o/California; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No.2: 12-CV-004S0-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 11 of 21\n1 \nher eyes were irrigated and a skin rash from the pepper spray was treated. \n2 \n54.  As reported by the University, ten persons were arrested, all on the same charges: Failure \n3 \nto Disperse from as Unlawful Assembly (Cal. Penal Code § 409).  They were released after several hours \n4 \nand all were assigned the same Court date for arraignment, January 31,2012. Prior to that date, however, \n5 \nthe District Attorney of Yolo County announced that no complaints would be filed against any of the \n6 \npersons arrested.  As of the filing of this complaint none of the plaintiffs has been charged with any \n7 \ncrime arising out of the November 18 protest. \n8 \n9  55.  At the time campus police started arresting people, a large number of students had \n10  gathered in a non-violent assemblage, which remained so but for the violence used by campus police \n11  officers, PIKE, SWARTWOOD, LEE and other campus police officers, inclusive, to arrest non-resisting \n12  persons.  All of those persons, who assembled, including plaintiffs who were pepper sprayed, were \n13  illegally required to disperse from the campus quad by helmeted police enforcing their erroneous \n14  decision that the gathering was unlawful. \n15 \n56.  Defendant REGENTS and KAT  EHI, HEXTER, WOOD, MEYER, and SPICUZZA are \n16 \nresponsible for making decisions which set in motion an operation, executed by PIKE, SWARTWOOD, \n17 \nLEE and other campus police officers, that any reasonable person in their positions would have known \n18 \nwould lead to the unlawful use of force against, and arrest or dispersal of, the demonstrators, including \n19 \nPlaintiffs.  Specifically, each ofthese named agents and employees of THE REGENTS was a part of an \n20 \nadministrative team at U.c. Davis that collectively made decisions that led to the violations, including \n21 \nbut not limited to the decision to dispatch the police to remove the tents and demonstrators without legal \n22 \nauthority to do so, and the decision that the operation take place in mid-afternoon, when large crowds of \n23 \nstudents were likely to gather in response to the police actions, even though they had been advised that \n24 \nthe operation should occur at night. \n25 \n57.  Defendant REGENTS, and KATEHI, MEYER and SPICUZZA had an affirmative duty to \n26 \nproperly screen, train and supervise defendants PIKE, SWARTWOOD, LEE and the other campus police \n27 \nofficers involved in the incident, but failed to do so, resulting in the actions and violations of the rights of \n28 \nPlaintiffs and others described herein. \n11 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et at, vs. Regents oft he University ofC al ifomia ; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No.2: 12-CV-00450-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 12 of 21\n1 \n58.  Defendant REGENTS and SPICUZZA are responsible for supervising and controlling the \n2 \nactions of police officers PIKE, SWARTWOOD, LEE and all other unnamed campus police officers. \n3 \nDefendant REGENTS and SPICUZZA are liable for all injuries described herein for acquiescing to \n4 \npolice officers' choice to wear riot gear and cany pepper spray which she knew or should have known \n5 \nwould lead to the excessive use of force against protestors, and for failing to stop the officers under their \n6 \ncommand from violating the rights of Plaintiffs and others. \n7 \n59.  SPICUZZA, PIKE, and SWARTWOOD were present when the violations took place and \n8 \nwere responsible for supervising and controlling the actions of subordinate police officers and had a duty \n9 \nto intervene and stop the unlawful conduct.  Their failure to do this resulted in the actions and violations \n10 \nof the rights of Plaintiffs and others described herein. \n11 \n12  60.  PIKE and LEE are responsible for pepper-spraying the students and are liable for the \n13  damages caused thereby;  Pike is also liable for ordering LEE to use the pepper spray. \n14 \n61.  KATEHI, MEYER and SPICUZZA failed properly to investigate the background of \n15 \nPIKE, who was not qualified for the position he held, and failed to terminate him or take other \n16 \nappropriate action when his lack of qualifications became known; as a result of the negligent hiring and \n17 \nretention of PIKE he was enabled personally to commit the violations described herein and to supervise \n18 \nand direct LEE and other campus police officers in the commission of the acts and violations described \n19 \nherein. \n20 \n62.  All of the plaintiffs, and the CLASS MEMBERS were injured by being deprived of their \n21 \nrights to assemble and to speak freely, and by being arrested and/or pepper sprayed and subjected to \n22 \nother acts of excessive force by Defendant REGENTS and those operating under their direction and \n23 \ncontrol and/or pursuant to policies, practices and procedures of The REGENTS and each of them.  Such \n24 \ninjuries included physical pain and suffering, deprivations of liberty, and infliction of emotional distress. \n25 \n63.  On information and belief, the actions of Defendant REGENTS, and each of the persons \n26 \noperating under Defendant REGENTS' direction and control, were intentional and malicious in that the \n27 \npepper spraying and arrest of peacefully assembled students on their college campus was so clearly in \n28 \n12 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et al. vs. Regents ()f the University ()f California; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No.2: 12-CV-00450-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 13 of 21\n1 \nviolation of established state and federal law that no inference other than that the Defendant REGENTS \n2 \nacted maliciously with intent to injure and to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional rights  can be \n3 \ndrawn, entitling Plaintiffs, and each of them, to awards of punitive damages in amounts to be determined \n4 \nat trial. \n5 \n64.  On information and belief, certain plaintiffs were targeted by the police for forcible arrests \n6 \nbased on their past political activism and associations at the University. \n7 \n8  65.  The actions of Defendant REGENTS, and each of their agents and employees, have had a \n9  chilling effect on the willingness of Plaintiffs to exercise their free-speech rights in areas under \n10  Defendant's control, causing Plaintiffs continuing injury that cannot be redressed by damages. \n11  IV.  CLASS CLAIMS \n12  66.  The arrest and pepper-spraying' to which named individual Plaintiffs and the CLASS \n13  MEMBERS were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices and procedures of Defendant \n14  REGENTS.  The named individual Plaintiffs and the CLASS MEMBERS seek a declaration from the \n15  Court that campus policies and practices that led to the abuse of the protesters and others offend both the \n16  state and federal constitutional guarantees of the rights to free speech and assembly and that the pepper-\n17  spraying and arrests violated their state and federal constitutional rights; an injunction to prevent \n18  repetition of such a response to a non-violent protest; and compensatory and punitive damages against \n19  Defendant REGENTS. \n20 \n67.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \n21 \nsituated (CLASS MEMBERS) pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California \n22 \nCode of Civil Procedure Sec. 382. \n23 \nV.  CLASS DEFINITIONS \n24 \n68.  The class is defined to include all persons, other than and in addition to those individual \n25 \nplaintiffs named in this Second Amended Complaint, who, in the afternoon of November 18,2011, while \n26 \nparticipating in a protest on the University of California at Davis Quad, were arrested and/or directly \n27 \nsprayed with pepper spray by a campus police officer. \n28 \n13 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker. et al. vs. Regents a/the University a/California; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. 2:12-CV-00450-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 14 of 21\n1 \n69.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the class \n2 \nare so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact number of \n3 \nclass members but plaintiffs are infonned and believe, and thereupon allege, that the number of \n4 \nindividually named plaintiffs together with the CLASS MEMBERS exceeds 25 persons. \n5 \n70.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are infonned \n6 \nand believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class including, \n7 \nbut not limited to:  (1) whether Defendant REGENTS knew or believed that unaffiliated persons were \n8 \nassociated with or participating in the November 18,2011, protest; (2) whether there was any indication \n9 \nor evidence that the health or safety of students was endangered by the protest; (3) whether any of the \n10 \nprotesters had occupied a tent or \"camped\" out during the night of November 17, 2011; whether any act \n11 \nhad occurred which could be used as a basis for declaring the protest to be an \"unlawful assembly;\" (4) \n12 \nwhether protesters represented a threat to campus police officers before they were arrested and/or pepper \n13 \nsprayed; and (5) whether the pepper spray used against the protesters was authorized as a weapon to be \n14 \nused by campus police officers. \n15 \n16  71.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are infonned \n17  and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class including, \n18  but not limited to: (1) whether the protest on the Quad on November 18,2011, was an unlawful \n19  assembly; (2) whether the arrests of plaintiffs were lawful; (3) whether the use of pepper-spray was \n20  excessive force; (4) whether the policies, practices and/or procedures of the Defendant REGENTS \n21  pursuant to which the acts of November 18, 2011, were taken, were constitutional under the state and \n22  federal constitutions; and (5) whether the arrests and/or pepper-spraying of plaintiffs and CLASS \n23  MEMBERS on November 18, 2011, violated the state and federal constitutional rights of the persons \n24  arrested and/or pepper sprayed. \n25  72.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative \n26 \nplaintiffs who are the individually named plaintiffs in this Second Amended Complaint, have claims that \n27 \nare typical of the CLASS MEMBERS whom they represent.  They have the same interests and suffered \n28 \nthe same type of injuries as all of the CLASS MEMBERS.  The Representative Plaintiffs' claims arose \n14 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et al. vs. Regents of the University o.(California; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. 2:l2-CV-00450-JAM-EFB \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 44   Filed 09/27/12   Page 15 of 21\n1 \nbecause of Defendant's policies, practices and procedures and their claims are based upon the same legal \n2 \ntheories as the claims of the CLASS MEMBERS.  The actual damages suffered by Representative \n3 \nPlaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each CLASS MEMBER.  In \n4 \naccordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the Representative Plaintiffs will fairly \n5 \nand adequately protect the class interests.  Representative Plaintiffs' interests are consistent with and not \n6 \nantagonistic to the interests of the class. \n7 \n73.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of \n8 \nseparate actions by individual members of the class could create a risk that inconsistent or varying \n9 \nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards of \n10 \nconduct for the parties opposing the class. \n11 \n12  74.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 (b)(1 )(B), prosecutions of \n13  separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications with \n14  respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair or \n15  impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests. \n16 \n75.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are \n17 \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable \n18 \nto the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class \n19 \nas a whole. \n20 \n76.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is \n21 \nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between the \n22 \nparties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of the \n23 \nclass in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low in that most unnamed class \n24 \nmembers would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, \n25 \nand thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals make separate suits impracticable. \n26 \nPlaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able \n27 \nto find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is \n28 \ndesirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location, i.e. \n15 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nBaker, et al.

It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common \n2 \nquestions oflaw and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts. \n3 \n77.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the CLASS MEMBERS but are informed \n4 \nand believe that the identities of the CLASS MEMBERS may be ascertained from close inspection of \n5 \nphotographs and video footage taken during the November 18,2011, event which is the subject of this \n6 \nlitigation. \n7 \n8  78.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), CLASS MEMBERS \n9  must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n10  believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendant's records contain a contact e-mail address for all students \n11  enrolled at U.C. Davis during the semester which includes November 18, 2011, and that notice of the \n12  pendency of this action may be e-mailed to all such student enrollees.  Plaintiffs contemplate that notice \n13  will be published, as well as e-mailed, and that notice will inform class members of the following: \n14 \ni.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \n15 \n11.  The nature of the action; \n16 \niii.  Their right to 'opt out' of the action within a given time, in which event they will \n17 \nnot be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n18 \n19  IV.  Their right, if they do not \"opt out,\" to be represented by their own counsel and to \n20  enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by the named \n21  class plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n22 \nv.  Their right, if they do not \"opt out,\" to share in any recovery in favor of the class, \n23 \nand conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues adverse to the \n24 \nclass. \n25  VI.

In prior years, Defendant and its agents and employees, as well as their predecessors in \n2 \ntheir positions, permitted assemblies, demonstrations and protests on campus which included the erection \n3 \nof structures such as tents and domes, when the message and speakers were less controversial.  In \n4 \ncontrast, Defendant and its agents and employees, and each of them, took the actions to disperse the \n5 \nlawful assembly on November 18, 2011, and to pepper spray and arrest students because of the \n6 \ndemonstration's message and who was delivering it. \n7 \n81.  By interfering, including through the use of excessive force, with Plaintiffs' peaceful \n8 \nprotest, the actions of Defendant and its agents and employees, and each of them, violated the rights of \n9 \nPlaintiffs and each of them guaranteed to them by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \n10 \nand caused them on-going irreparable injury and damage, as stated above. \n11 \n12  82.

The actions of the police provoked shock and outrage nationally, in part because the video \n12\nfootage was so reminiscent of the infamous images of police in the South using fire hoses to spray and \n13\ndisperse nonviolent student sit-ins during the civil rights movement.  \n14\n  The 19 plaintiffs in this action were protesting university privatization, distribution of resources, \n15\ntuition hikes, police brutality and other onerous public policies adopted by the University administration \n16\nand the Board of Regents. Their protest was an integral part of continuing, vigorous assembly and free \n17\nspeech activities which had been conducted by students for weeks at the same time the nationwide \n18\nOccupy Wall Street movement mobilized thousands nationwide.  Seventeen of the plaintiffs were U.C. \n19\nDavis students at the time; the other two are recent graduates.    \n20\n  This action seeks the following relief: a declaration from the Court that campus policies and \n21\npractices that led to the abuse of the plaintiffs and others offend both the state and federal constitutional \n22\nguarantees of the rights to free speech and assembly and that the pepper-spraying and arrests of plaintiffs \n23\nviolated their state and federal constitutional rights; an injunction to prevent repetition of such a response \n24\nto a non-violent protest; and compensatory and punitive damages against the individual perpetrators of \n25\nthe illegal acts and their superiors who ordered, directed and/or condoned this outrageous conduct.. \n26\nI.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27\n1.   Because this civil-rights action arises under the United States Constitution, this Court has \n28\n \n2 \n    COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n  Enosh Baker, et al. vs. Linda Katehi, et al.; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. __________ \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 1    Filed 02/22/12   Page 3 of 14\n \n1\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and, 1343(a)(3), (4).  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over \n2\nthe state law claims under 28 U.S.C. §1367. \n3\n2.

Davis students joined others in San Francisco to demonstrate at a \n25\nscheduled Board of Regents meeting, protesting university privatization, tuition increases, and the brutal \n26\ntreatment of demonstrators on Berkeley’s campus the previous week.  They returned to campus and, on \n27\nNovember 17, a general assembly of students agreed to set up symbolic tents on the quad and to continue \n28\n \n6 \n    COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n  Enosh Baker, et al. vs. Linda Katehi, et al.; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. __________ \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 1    Filed 02/22/12   Page 7 of 14\n \n1\nto meet openly, to “occupy the quad” to discuss and study university privatization, tuition hikes, and their \n2\nrelation to other issues of macro political and social importance, and to consider what they could do to \n3\nchange conditions which had brought people together in support of the Occupy Wall Street Movement. \n4\n33.  A group of students set up tents on the quad and the “Occupation of the Quad” began.  \n5\nShortly after the first tents were erected, U.C. Davis administrative employees delivered to some of the \n6\nstudents on the quad a notice that included a campus “no overnight camping” policy.  The notice was \n7\ndiscussed and the group concluded that they were symbolically “occupying the quad” in support of and \n8\nin solidarity with the 99% championed by the Occupy Wall Street movement. \n9\n34.  On the evening of November 17, the Associated Students of the University of California \n10\nat Davis (ASUCD) endorsed the “occupation of the quad.”   \n11\n35.  On November 18, in the afternoon, Defendant Police Chief SPICUZZZA, accompanied \n12\nby a Doe Defendant, delivered a letter from Defendant Chancellor KATEHI directing students to remove \n13\nthe tents by 3:00 p.m. “in interest of safety, respect for our campus environment and in accordance with \n14\nour Principles of Community.” \n15\n36.  Students held another assembly, discussed the letter the Chancellor had delivered, and \n16\nmany decided to remove their tents and did so.  Others resolved to remain.  \n17\n37.  Shortly before 3:00 p.m., a large number of police in riot gear armed with long batons, \n18\npepper-ball guns and other weapons were seen massing in formation adjacent to the quad.  The students \n19\nmoved the remaining tents to the circle on the Centennial Walk, a concrete pathway in the middle of the \n20\ncampus quad, and stood around them.     \n21\n38.  The officers advanced on the students as can be seen on any number of videotapes.  They \n22\nbegan pushing students away, or throwing them to the ground. Some of the officers disassembled or \n23\ndestroyed the tents.  As the tents were being removed, students sat down in a large circle.  Classes were \n24\nletting out and hundreds of additional students swarmed out of their buildings to watch what was \n25\nhappening. \n26\n39.  The campus officers pointed to specific students, arrested them and began grabbing them \n27\nand hauling them off to jail.  Plaintiff ENOSH BAKER was the first to be grabbed and thrown to the \n28\nground by two police officers, Defendants DOE 2 and DOE 3.  He hit his head on a sprinkler fixture as \n \n7 \n    COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n  Enosh Baker, et al. vs. Linda Katehi, et al.; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. __________ \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 1    Filed 02/22/12   Page 8 of 14\n \n1\nhe was thrown to the ground and his hands were tightly zip tied together behind his back as he was taken \n2\ninto custody and placed into a police car. \n3\n40.  Plaintiff CHARLES PARKER was targeted by three police officers, Defendants DOE 7, \n4\nDOE 8, and DOE 9 grabbed him.  His hands were painfully zip tied behind his back, exacerbating a prior \n5\nmilitary combat injury, and he was placed into a police car where he joined BAKER and plaintiff \n6\nELIZABETH LARA. \n7\n41.  Plaintiff LARA had arrived immediately prior to the police advancing on those students \n8\nstanding around the circle and joined the circle.  When the police reached the crowd she was thrown to \n9\nthe ground by Defendant police officers DOES 16 and 17, her hands were zip tied behind her, and she \n10\nwas arrested and taken to the police car which then transported her, PARKER and BAKER to the police \n11\nstation. Plaintiffs’ hands were all zip tied, some zip ties were particularly tight, cutting off blood flow, \n12\nbut the jailers did not have the special equipment needed to cut the plastic ties.  Eventually, the zip ties \n13\nwere cut and removed. \n14\n42.  As the group of students was being pushed by officers, students began to sit down in a \n15\nline.  Officers were stepping over the seated students, who did nothing to stop them. Then Defendant \n16\nPIKE ordered the students to leave or stated they would be “shot.” As is discernible from audio tapes of \n17\nhis reaction, Plaintiff WHEATLEY responded: “You’re going to shoot us if we don’t leave?”  \n18\n43.  Defendant PIKE then shook a canister of pepper spray like a can of aerosol paint, stepped \n19\nover the line of sitting, crouching students and walked up and down the line repeatedly dousing Plaintiffs \n20\nwith orange colored pepper spray, mostly from a distance of one-to-two feet.  Students watching the \n21\nscene screamed or shouted: “Shame.” \n22\n44.  Another officer, Doe 1, then approached the line of seated demonstrators from behind and \n23\nbegan spraying them with a separate canister of pepper spray.   \n24\n45.  Documents that the University of California has subsequently released in response to a \n25\nrequest for public records indicate that the substance used was Defense Technology’s MK-9 Magnum \n26\nspray, with a major Capsaicinoid concentration of .7%.  The single page of manufacturer’s information \n27\nthat the University was able to provide states that the minimum recommended distance for this \n28\nformulation is 6 feet.  The University states that it has no other package inserts, warnings, or instructions \n \n8 \n    COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n  Enosh Baker, et al. vs. Linda Katehi, et al.; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. __________ \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 1    Filed 02/22/12   Page 9 of 14\n \n1\nrelating to this product, although California law requires that all such substances sold in California be \n2\naccompanied by printed instructions for use, first aid information, and safety information.  See Ca. Penal \n3\nCode § 22810(e)(4), (f) (former § 12403.7).   \n4\n46.  Plaintiff MATZAT’s hands were zip-tied behind his back and he was arrested along with \n5\nPlaintiff WHEATLEY who had been pepper-sprayed and both had been transferred to jail by Defendants \n6\nDoes 23, and 4 and 18 and 19, respectively.  \n7\n47.  Plaintiffs BUSCHO, GROSSJAN-NAVARRO, JOHNSON, KAMRAN, IAN LEE, SOO \n8\nLEE, LOKER, ROBERTS, SBEIHN, WHALEY-MAYDA and WILDANGER were pepper sprayed by \n9\nDefendant PIKE and Doe Officers and left to deal with their burning eyes, faces and skin.  Neither the \n10\nUniversity nor the police provided adequate medical attention on the scene to any of the students who \n11\nhad been sprayed. \n12\n48.  Members of the campus student body administered first aid to Plaintiffs who could not see \n13\nand were disoriented.  Plaintiff WHALEY-MAYDA was transported by ambulance to the hospital where \n14\nher eyes were irrigated and a skin rash from the pepper spray was treated. \n15\n49.  As reported by the University, ten persons were arrested, all on the same charges: Failure \n16\nto Disperse from as Unlawful Assembly (Cal. Penal Code § 409).  They were released after several hours \n17\nand all were assigned the same court date for arraignment, January 31, 2012.  Prior to that date, however, \n18\nthe District Attorney of Yolo County announced that no complaints would be filed against any of the \n19\npersons arrested.  As of the filing of this complaint none of the plaintiffs has been charged with any \n20\ncrime arising out of the November 18 protest.   \n21\n50.  At the time campus police started arresting people, a large number of students had \n22\ngathered in a non-violent assemblage, which remained so but for the violence used by Defendant police \n23\nofficers, PIKE and Does 1 to 50, inclusive, to arrest non-resisting persons.  All of those persons, who \n24\nassembled, including plaintiffs who were pepper sprayed, were illegally required to disperse from the \n25\ncampus quad by helmeted police enforcing their erroneous decision that the gathering was unlawful. \n26\n51.  The decision to declare the assemblage of students on the quad at 3:00 p.m. on November \n27\n18, 2011, unlawful, was made by defendants, KATEHI, HEXTER, WOOD, MEYER and SPICUZZA, \n28\nacting in concert, and executed by defendants PIKE and Defendant DOES 1 through 50, inclusive.   \n \n9 \n    COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n  Enosh Baker, et al. vs. Linda Katehi, et al.; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. __________ \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 1    Filed 02/22/12   Page 10 of 14\n \n1\nThere was no legal cause to disperse the assembly, and the declaration of an unlawful assembly violated \n2\nthe plaintiffs’ rights of freedom of speech and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment to the \n3\nUnited States Constitution and the Liberty of Speech Clause of the California Constitution. \n4\n52.  Defendants KATEHI, HEXTER, WOOD, MEYER and SPICUZZA had an affirmative \n5\nduty to properly screen, train and supervise defendants PIKE and DOE Defendants 1 through 50, but \n6\nfailed to do so, resulting in the actions and violations of the rights of Plaintiffs and others described \n7\nherein. \n8\n53.  Defendants KATEHI, HEXTER, WOOD, MEYER and SPICUZZA failed properly to \n9\ninvestigate the background of Defendant PIKE who was not qualified for the position he held, and failed \n10\nto terminate him when his lack of qualifications became known; as a result of the negligent hiring and \n11\nretention of Defendant PIKE he was enabled personally to commit the violations described herein and to \n12\nsupervise and direct defendants DOES 1 through 50 in the commission of the acts and violations \n13\ndescribed herein. \n14\n54.  All of the plaintiffs, as well as others who may be joined to this action when they come \n15\nforward, were injured by being deprived of their rights to assemble and to speak freely, and by being \n16\narrested and/or pepper sprayed and subjected to other acts of excessive force by defendants and each of \n17\nthem.  Such injuries included physical pain and suffering, deprivations of liberty, and infliction of \n18\nemotional distress. \n19\n55.  The actions of Defendants, and each of them, were intentional and malicious in that the \n20\npepper spraying and arrest of peacefully assembled students on their college campus was so clearly in \n21\nviolation of established state and federal law that no inference other than that the Defendants acted \n22\nmaliciously with intent to injure and to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional rights  can be drawn, \n23\nentitling Plaintiffs, and each of them, to awards of punitive damages in amounts to be determined at trial. \n24\n56.  On information and belief, certain plaintiffs were targeted by the police for forcible arrests \n25\nbased on their past political activism and associations at the University.  \n26\n57.  The actions of Defendants, and each of them, have had a chilling effect on the willingness \n27\nof Plaintiffs to exercise their free-speech rights in areas under Defendants’ control, causing Plaintiffs \n28\ncontinuing injury that cannot be redressed by damages.   \n \n10 \n    COMPLAINT; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n  Enosh Baker, et al. vs. Linda Katehi, et al.; United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Case No. __________ \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB   Document 1    Filed 02/22/12   Page 11 of 14\n \n1 IV.

By interfering, including through the use of excessive force, Plaintiffs’ peaceful protest, \n11 the actions of defendants and each of them violated the rights of Plaintiffs and each of them guaranteed \n12 to them by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and caused them on-going irreparable \n13 injury and damage, as stated above. \n14 61.

This Final  Order and Judgment incorporates by  reference the definitions  in the \n15 \nStipulation for Settlement among the parties submitted as Exhibit A to the Joint Application for \n16 \nPre1iminary  Approval  of Settlement  (Dckt.  No.  40),  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  1,  and  all \n17 \ncapitalized terms used herein that also appear in the Stipulation for Settlement have the meanings \n18 \nset forth in the Stipulation for Settlement. \n19 \n2.

The court has personal jurisdiction over the Representative Class \n21 \nPlaintiffs, Defendant, and the Class. \n22 \n3.  The Notices of the proposed settlement (in the form attached as Exhibit B to the \n23 \n24  Stipulation for Settlement, as amended per order of the Court) and the Publication Notice (in the \n25  form attached as Exhibit C to the Stipulation for Settlement, as amended per order of the Court) \n26  were directed to members of the proposed Class in accordance with the Preliminary Approval \n27  Order, dated September 27, 2012 (Dckt.

Pursuant to, and in accordance with, Rule 23 of the \n3 \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court hereby finds that the Notice and Publication Notice \n4 \nprovided members of the Class due and adequate notice of the Settlement, the Stipulation for \n5 \nSettlement, these proceedings, and the rights of members of the Classes to exclude themselves \n6 \nfrom or to object to the Settlement. \n7 \n4.  Pursuant to Rule 23  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court hereby \n8 \napproves the Settlement as set forth in the Stipulation for Settlement and finds that the Settlement \n9 \nis in all respects fair, reasonable, and adequate to the Class Members.  Accordingly, the Settlement \n10 \nshall  be  consummated  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  provisions  of the  Stipulation  for \n11 \nSettlement, the terms of which are incorporated by re~erence into this Final Order and Judgment. \n12 \n5.  By its Preliminary Approval Order dated September 27,  2012, 2012, the Court \n13 \npreliminarily certified the following Settlement Class: \n14 \n15  All  persons who  were arrested or directly sprayed with pepper spray by \npolice officers working for or on the behalf of the University of California, Davis \n16 \nPolice Department on November 18, 2011, on the area known as \"the Quad,\" on \n17 .  the University of California, Davis campus. \n18 \n6.  The Court finds that the Settlement Class satisfies the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. \n19 \nP. 23, including the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy pursuant \n20 \nto Rule 23(a), and at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(l)(A). The Court \n21 \nhereby certifies the Settlement Class as described in Paragraph 5 of this Order and Judgment. \n22 \n7.  The Court approves Plaintiffs  Enosh Baker, David Buscho, Alyson Cook, Adam \n23 \nFetterman, Sarena Grossjan, Deanna Johnson, Sophia Kamran, Elizabeth Lara, Ian Lee, Soo Lee, \n24 \nEvan Loker, Thomas Matzat, Darren Newell, Charles Parker,  William  Roberts,  Fatima Sbeih, \n25 \nEvka Whaley-Mayda,  Kase  Wheatley,  Edward  Geoffrey  Wildanger,  Noah  Wiley,  and  Jordan \n26 \n27  Wilheim  (hereinafter \"Representative  Plaintiffs\")  as  Class  Representatives  for  the  Settlement \n28  Class. \n3 \n[PROPOSED] FINAL ORDER AND JUDGMENT \n{O:OB9074.DOC) \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 50-4  Filed 12/21/12  Page 4 of 28 \n1  8.  The Court finds that Class Counsel, Mark E. Merin, the American Civil Liberties \n2 \nFoundation of Northern California (''ACLU\"), and Meredith Wallis have fairly and adequately \n3 \nrepresented the interests of the Class and satisfied all the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g). \n4 \n9.  The Regents of the University of California (\"Regents\") shall make the settlement \n5 \npayments called for in Section 2 of the Stipulation for Settlement within 15 (fifteen) days of the \n6 \nEffective Date as defined in Section 1.8 of the Stipulation.  The Court finds that the payments to \n7 \nthe Class Representatives are not unduly preferential, and the amounts are justified based on the \n8 \ninjuries  and damages they  suffered and  the  burdens  carried by the Class  Representatives  in \n9 \ncommencing and prosecuting the Litigation, including the notoriety attendant on pursuit of the \n10 \nLitigation and the amount of time and effort involved. \n11 \n10.  Upon  the  Settlement  becoming  Final  in  accordance  with  Section  1.11  of the \n12 \nStipulation  for  Settlement  (i)  the  Releasing  Parties  are  permanently  barred  from filing, \n13 \ncommencing,  prosecuting,  intervening in,  participating in  or receiving  any  benefits from  any \n14 \n15  lawsuit, arbitration, administrative or regulatory proceeding or order based on any or all Released \n16  Claims against one or more Released Persons, and (ii) the Released Persons are and shall be \n17  unconditionally,  fully  and  finally  released  and  forever  discharged  from  all  Released  Claims \n18  against each of the Releasing Parties in accordance with the Stipulation for Settlement.  Each \n19  Class Member may hereafter discover facts other than or different from those which he or she \n20  knows or believes to be true with respect to the Released Claims, but each Class Member has \n21 \nexpressly waived and fully,  finally and forever released and discharged any and all  known or \n22 \nunknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, contingent or non-contingent claim \n23 \nthat would otherwise fall  within the definition of Released Claims, whether or not concealed or \n24 \nhidden, without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such different or additional \n25 \nfacts, upon the Settlement becoming Final. \n26 \n11.  Upon consideration of Class Counsel's Fee and Expense Statement to the Court for \n27 \nan award of fees and costs, and the agreement of The Regents in the Stipulation for Settlement to \n28 \npay the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) for all attorneys' fees and costs \n4 \n[PROPOSED] FINAL ORDER AND JUDGMENT \n{01089074.DOCl \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 50-4  Filed 12/21/12  Page 5 of 28 \n1 \nincurred in connection with the prosecution of the Litigation and administration of the settlement, \n2 \nthe Court hereby awards the sum of $250,000.00, jointly and severally, to the Law Offices of \n3 \nMark E.  Merin, the American Civil Liberties Foundation of Northern California, and Meredith \n4 \nWallis. \n5 \n12.  The attorneys'  fees  and  costs and  payments to  Class Members  authorized  and \n6 \napproved by this Final Order and Judgment shall constitute full and final satisfaction of any and \n7 \nall claims that Representative Plaintiffs and any Class member, and their respective counsel, may \n8 \nhave  or  assert  for  reimbursement  of fees  and  costs  or  Class  Representative  payments,  and \n9 \nRepresentative  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members,  and  their  respective  counsel,  shall  not  seek  or \n10 \ndemand payment of any additional fees and costs or Class Representative payments, except as \n11 \nprovided for in Section 3 of the Stipulation for Settlement, which provides that the Regents will \n12 \nreimburse the ACLU up to $20,000 (twenty thousand dollars) for reasonable attorneys' fees and \n13 \ncosts incurred by the ACLU in reviewing and commenting on the Davis campus' written policies, \n14 \n15  including the Regents' written policies applicable to the Davis campus, pertaining to the use of \n16  force  by  police,  the  handling of student demonstrations,  and  crowd control.  Except  for  the \nRegents'  obligation to reimburse the ACLU up to $20,000 as provided for in Section 3 of the \n18  Stipulation for Settlement, the Released. Persons (as defined in Section 1.20 of the Stipulation for \n19  Settlement) shall have no further responsibility for,  and no liability whatsoever with respect to, \n20 \nany payment or disbursement of attorneys' fees and costs or payments, nor with respect to any \n21 \nallocation of attorneys' fees and costs or payments to any other person or entity who may assert \n22 \nany claim thereto. \n23 \n13.  Without in any way affecting the finality of this Final Order and Judgment, this \n24 \nCourt has continuing jurisdiction as to all matters relating to the interpretation, administration, and \n25 \nenforcement of the Stipulation for Settlement. \n26 \n14.  The Court finds that this Final Order and Judgment adjudicates all of the claims, \n27 \nrights, and liabilities of the Parties to the Settlement, and is intended to be final and immediately \n28 \nappealable.

THE LITIGATION \n14 \nOn February 22, 2012, Plaintiff!; filed their initial Complaint in this Litigation.  On July \n15 \n20, 2012, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") naming as defendants \n16 \nmembers of the University ofCalifornia Administration Linda Katehi, Ralph J. Hexter, Fred \n17 \nWood and John Meyer; Chief of the University of California at Davis (\"UC Davis\") Police \n18 \nDepartment Annette Spicuzza; and UC Davis Police Department officers John Pike, Barry \n19 \nSwartwood and Alexander Lee.  The Complaint alleges nine separate claims for relief, all arising \n20 \nout of an incident involving U.C. Davis campus police and demonstrators and observers on the \n21 \ncampus ofthe University ofCalifornia, Davis, on the afternoon of Friday, November 18,2011. \n22 \nPlaintiffs allege, inter alia, that, as part of the broader Occupy Wall Street movement, they had set \n23 \nup symbolic tents on an area of the campus known as the Quad in protest against university \n24 \nprivatization, tuition increases, and the treatment of demonstrators at the University of California, \n25. \nBerkeley.  On Friday, November 18,2011, members ofthe UC Administration directed the \n26 \ndemonstrators to remove the tents be from the Quad by 3:00p.m.  At about 3:00p.m., members \n27 \nofthe UC Davis Police Department declared the demonstration an unlawful assembly, ordered \n28 \n-2- STfPULA TTON FOR SETTLEMENT; \nCASE NO. 2:12-CV-00450 \nSFACTIVE-902852644.1 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 50-4  Filed 12/21/12  Page 12 of 28 \nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 40-1  Filed 09/26/12  Page 4 of 20 \nthose assembled to disperse, and commenced to remove the tents from the Quad, arresting and \n2 \npepper-spraying demonstrators, including Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that they and others \n3 \nsimilarly situated were deprived of their civil rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \n4 \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution by being subjected to unlawful arrest and/or excessive \n5 \nforce (including pepper spray) by or at the direction of agents or employees of the Regents.  The \n6 \nComplaint seeks compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, \n7 \nplus attorneys' fees and costs.  Plaintiffs believe that the evidence developed to date supports \n8 \ntheir position, and that their claims have legal and factual merit. \n9 \nIII.  DEFENDANTS' DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY \n10 \nDefendants have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims alleged by \n11 \nPlaintiffs in the Litigation.  Defendants contend that they acted reasonably and in good faith to \n12 \naddress legitimate health and safety risks associated with an unpermitted encampment on the \n13 \nQuad, and not out of any intent to suppress debate and protest, or to deprive Plaintiffs of their civil \n14 \nrights.  Defendants contend that the arrests and use of force were a lawful response to the efforts of \n15 \nPlaintiffs and others to interfere with the UC Officer Defendants' performance of their lawful \n16 \nobjectives of removing tents erected without permits in violation of University policy and \n17 \nremoving arrestees from the Quad.  Defendants believe that the evidence developed to date \n18 \nsupports their position that they acted reasonably and with good intentions, without violating the \n19 \nrights of Plaintiffs or others, and that the Litigation is without merit. \n20 \nIV.  MEDIATION AND SETTLEMENT \n21 \nOn March 14, 2012, prior to the filing of responsive pleadings by any Defendants, the \n22 \nParties then named in the Litigation entered into a Stipulation and Proposed Order for Extension of \n23 \nTime to Respond to the Complaint and Other Dates in order to permit the Parties to explore \n24 \nsettlement.  (Dckt. No. 10) The Court approved the stipulation.  (Dckt. No. 13) \n25 \nThe Parties engaged The Hon. Raul Ramirez (Ret.) to serve as mediator.  In preparation for \n26 \nthe mediation, the Parties engaged in informal discovery, including the production of documents \n27 \nand the exchange of information.  On August 15 and 16, 2012, the Parties engaged in mediation in \n28 \n-3- STIPULATION FOR SETTLEMENT; \nCASE NO. 212-CV -00450 \nSF A.CTIVE-902852644.1 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 50-4  Filed 12/21/12  Page 13 of 28 \nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 40-1  Filed 09/26/12  Page 5 of 20 \nSacramento, California, with respect to the claims and defenses raised in the Litigation.  As a \n2 \nresult of the mediation, the Parties reached an agreement on a settlement of the Litigation, the \n3. \nterms and conditions of which are set forth in this Stipulation. \n4 \nBoth Plaintiffs and Defendants have taken into account the uncertainty and risks inherent \n5 \nin any litigation.  Plaintiffs and Defendants have concluded that further conduct of the Litigation \n6 \nwould be protracted and expensive, with no certainty as to the ultimate outcome, and that it is \n7 \nreasonable and desirable that the Litigation be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the \n8 \nterms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.  Plaintiffs and their counsel believe that the \n9 \nsettlement set forth in the Stipulation confers substantial benefits upon the Class, and that it is fair \n10 \nand reasonable.  Based on their evaluation, Plaintiffs and their counsel have determined that the \n1 I \nsettlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of the Class. \n12 \nTERMS OF STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT OF SETTLEMENT \n13 \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED by and among the \n14 \nPlaintiffs (for themselves and the Class Members, as defined below) and the Defendants, by and \n15 \nthrough their respective counsel or attorneys of record, that, subject to the approval ofthe Court, \n16 \nthe Litigation and the Released Claims (as defined below) shall be finally and fully compromised, \n17 \nsettled, and released, and the Litigation shall be dismissed with prejudice, as to all Settling \n18 \nParties, upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, as follows. \n19 \n1.

THE LITIGATION \n14 \nOn February 22, 2012, Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint in this Litigation.  On July \n15 \n20,2012, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") naming as defendants \n16 \nmembers of the University of California Administration Linda Katehi, Ralph J. Hexter, Fred \n17 \nWood and John Meyer; Chief ofthe University of California at Davis (\"UC Davis\") Police \n18 \nDepartment Annette Spicuzza; and UC Davis Police Department officers John Pike, Barry \n19 \nSwartwood and Alexander Lee.  The Complaint alleges nine separate claims for relief, all arising \n20 \nout of an incident involving U.C. Davis campus police and demonstrators and observers on the \n21 \ncampus of the University of California, Davis, on the afternoon of Friday, November 18, 2011. \n22 \nPlaintiffs allege, inter alia, that, as part of the broader Occupy Wall Street movement, they had set \n23 \nup symbolic tents on an area ofthe campus known as the Quad in protest against university \n24 \nprivatization, tuition increases, and the treatment of demonstrators at the University of California, \n25 \nBerkeley.  On Friday, November 18,2011, members of the UC Administration directed the \n26 \ndemonstrators to remove the tents be from the Quad by 3:00 p.m.  At about 3:00 p.m., members \n27 \nof the UC Davis Police Department declared the demonstration an unlawful assembly, ordered \n28 \n-2- STIPULATION FOR SETTLEMENT; \nCASE NO.2: 12-CV-00450 \nSFACTIVE-902852644.1 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 40-1  Filed 09/26/12  Page 4 of 20 \n1 \nthose assembled to disperse, and commenced to remove the tents from the Quad, arresting and \n2 \npepper-spraying demonstrators, including Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that they and others \n3 \nsimilarly situated were deprived of their civil rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \n4 \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution by being subjected to unlawful arrest and/or excessive \n5 \nforce (including pepper spray) by or at the direction of agents or employees ofthe Regents.  The \n6 \nComplaint seeks compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, \n7 \nplus attorneys' fees and costs.  Plaintiffs believe that the evidence developed to date supports \n8 \ntheir position, and that their claims have legal and factual merit. \n9 \nIII.  DEFENDANTS' DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY \n10 \nDefendants have denied and continue to deny each and all ofthe claims alleged by \n11 \nPlaintiffs in the Litigation.  Defendants contend that they acted reasonably and in good faith to \n12 \naddress legitimate health and safety risks associated with an unpermitted encampment on the \n13 \nQuad, and not out of any intent to suppress debate and protest, or to deprive Plaintiffs of their civil \n14 \nrights.  Defendants contend that the arrests and use of force were a lawful response to the efforts of \n15 \nPlaintiffs and others to interfere with the UC Officer Defendants' performance of their lawful \n16 \nobjectives of removing tents erected without permits in violation of University policy and \n17 \nremoving arrestees from the Quad.  Defendants believe that the evidence developed to date \n18 \nsupports their position that they acted reasonably and with good intentions, without violating the \n19 \nrights of Plaintiffs or others, and that the Litigation is without merit. \n20 \nIV.  MEDIATION AND SETTLEMENT \n21 \nOn March 14,2012, prior to the filing of responsive pleadings by any Defendants, the \n22 \nParties then named in the Litigation entered into a StipUlation and Proposed Order for Extension of \n23 \nTime to Respond to the Complaint and Other Dates in order to permit the Parties to explore \n24 \nsettlement.  (Dckt. No. 10)  The Court approved the stipulation.  (Dckt. No. 13) \n25 \nThe Parties engaged The Hon. Raul Ramirez (Ret.) to serve as mediator.  In preparation for \n26 \nthe mediation, the Parties engaged in informal discovery, including the production of documents \n27 \nand the exchange of information.  On August 15 and 16, 2012, the Parties engaged in mediation in \n28 \n-3- STIPULATION FOR SETTLEMENT; \nCASE NO. 2:12-CV-00450 \nSFACTIVE-902852644.i \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00450-JAM-EFB  Document 40-1  Fi'led 09/26/12  Page 5 of 20 \n1 \nSacramento, California, with respect to the claims and defenses raised in the Litigation.  As a \n2 \nresult of the mediation, the Parties reached an agreement on a settlement of the Litigation, the \n3 \nterms and conditions of which are set forth in this Stipulation. \n4 \nBoth Plaintiffs and Defendants have taken into account the uncertainty and risks inherent \n5 \nin any litigation.  Plaintiffs and Defendants have concluded that further conduct of the Litigation \n6 \nwould be protracted and expensive, with no certainty as to the ultimate outcome, and that it is \n7 \nreasonable and desirable that the Litigation be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the \n8 \nterms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.  Plaintiffs and their counsel believe that the \n9 \nsettlement set forth in the Stipulation confers substantial benefits upon the Class, and that it is fair \n10 \nand reasonable.  Based on their evaluation, Plaintiffs and their counsel have determined that the \n11 \nsettlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of the Class. \n12 \nTERMS OF STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT OF SETTLEMENT \n13 \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED by and among the \n14 \nPlaintiffs (for themselves and the Class Members, as defined below) and the Defendants, by and \n15 \nthrough their respective counselor attorneys of record, that, subject to the approval of the Court, \n16 \nthe Litigation and the Released Claims (as defined below) shall be finally and fully compromised, \n17 \nsettled, and released, and the Litigation shall be dismissed with prejudice, as to all Settling \n18 \nParties, upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, as follows. \n19 \n1.
